ANAHEIM , California —
A new expansion pack called Cataclysm will shake up the venerable World of Warcraft world , Blizzard Entertainment said Friday .
" I 'm confident it will be nothing less than earth - shattering , " Chris Metzen , Blizzard 's vice president of development , said as he unveiled the Cataclysm trailer Friday at BlizzCon , the company 's annual fan convention held at the Anaheim Convention Center .
" It will very literally change the world of Azeroth as you know it . "
Based on Warcraft lore , the new expansion shows the game world transformed by a geological rift and strife between the game 's factions .
" There can be no peace when the world itself is devoured by rage , " the trailer proclaimed .
" The world will never be the same . "
The trailer , which comes after much speculation following Blizzard 's trademarking of the Cataclysm name , also depicted the churning Maelstrom between the two continents , the Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor , while various zones in the game were shown being destroyed and covered in lava .
Classic zones are permanently changed .
The expansion includes two new races , which were leaked prior to the event : Goblins for the Horde faction and the wolf - like Worgen for the Alliance faction .
There will also be flying mounts added to main game world of Azeroth , and the level cap will be raised from 80 to 85 .
Other features include new race - class combinations , monsters , dungeons , raids and achievements ; the new secondary skill of Archaeology ; heroic settings added to the classic dungeons Deadmines and Shadowfang Keep ; a new guild leveling system ; a Path of the Titans character progression ; and the return of a classic end - boss named Deathwing .

“ Will we survive our technology ? ” – The Singularity Film , 2009
With four films coming out less than a year apart , it ’s a pretty cool time to be interested in the future and the growth of intelligence .
That ’s right , four movies on the Singularity !
In a year ’s span .
It ’s kind of nuts : Transcendent Man debuted earlier this year , The Singularity Film and The Singularity is Near will both premier before year ’s end , and We Are The Singularity is still in production .
All four movies have the same general topic and largely similar casts of characters , but each views the future through a different lens .
Not very comforting for those curious about the potentially greatest change humanity may ever face .
Check out the trailers after the break .
So what ’s the Singularity : crackpot idea , oncoming danger , Pinnochio story , or humanity ’s hope ?
Each film chooses a different angle .
What ’s really amazing is that these movies are all spontaneously coming from different producers / directors .
There ’s a developing trend to discuss the issues of technology and intelligence even if most of the world has no idea what the Singularity means .
I guess that whether you ’re a technophile or a technophobe , there ’s something to debate when you bring up the future .
Even if you think the whole thing is one giant hair - brained notion you ’ll at least get a kick out of the enthusiasm through which these films approach the subject .
The Singularity Film seems to focus on the monumental dangers and promises that the future holds , without really saying for certain how the Singularity may fit in .
The trailer begins just by giving differing definitions of what Singularity means .
Are we talking about the rise of artificial intelligence ?
Perhaps the Singularity marks the merging of man and technology .
Maybe it ’s just a point in history beyond which our predictions are meaningless .
While we wo n’t know for certain what director Doug Wolens believes until the movie premiers , the marketing campaign has already made its choice .
The tag line is obviously a nod towards oncoming dangers .
Heck , even the way they announce the premier date , “ coming at the end of 2009 ” seems pretty ominous .
Still , Wolens previous topics , the Cannabis Cup , and a tree - hugger named Butterfly , probably mean that the film will be more even handed than the tag line .
We Are The Singularity , or WATS for short , is a totally different kind of animal .
Director Chris Williamson , who runs his own blog about the Singularity , is actively pursuing potential viewers to donate to the film .
Give Williamson $ 25 and he ’ll put you in the credits , give you a free copy of the film , and let you enter a discussion group just for donors .
The $ 25,000 he hopes to raise is n’t the lion ’s share of the funding , it ’s more of a push to get people vested in the film .
He wants the documentary to be community guided to some extent , and the donor group will choose the film ’s title as well as have other input .
Is Williamson , enthusiastic ?
Definitely , and the film is likely to be the same .
It ’s unclear how far along the shooting has progressed ( he only has $ 1225 of the donations he hopes to raise ) , but we ’ll keep you posted as it continues .
As I mentioned after watching the Tribeca Film Festival premier of Transcendent Man and the amazing panel discussion after , the film is as much about Ray Kurzweil as it is about the Singularity .
In fact , much of the film is concerned with whether or not Kurzweil ’s predictions stem from psychological pressures in his life .
We ’ve included the trailer here again for completeness .
Kurzweil gets a chance to guide his own response as writer , co-director , and co-producer of the movie version of his pivotal book The Singularity is Near .
That ’s a lot of input from one man , so expect the film to really express Kurzweil ’s opinions first and foremost .
Along side the main discussion of what the Singularity may mean for humanity , Kurzweil will provide a b- story line about Ramona , a robot billed as Ray ’s female alter ego .
What better way to understand Kurzweil ’s vision of the Singularity than by walking you through the proposed steps of a person / thing that will experience it ?
No trailers yet , but we ’ll keep you up to date as we get closer to the premier .
Do four documentaries mean that the public is starting to believe in the Singularity ?
Probably not .
Most people would n’t even know what you were talking about if you asked .
Most experts do n’t agree on a definition , as The Singularity Film is quick to point out .
What we do know is that those people who are concerned with this possible future want to get the word out .
Whether that word is think , fear , observe , or hope depends on which movie you ’re watching .
Drunk on success , Author Dan Brown rewrites Absalom Absalom !
It begins :
Aging woman Rosa Coldfield was sitting in a room as hot as a Hotpoint oven that had been left on for a very long time even though nothing was cooking yet that anyone could sense or smell .
She could almost taste the Southern aspects of the air that was full of air things like hot molecules and the paint chip things that fall off the walls in old houses as they sit like two eyes cut with dull southern scissors from an old magazine about sharks or other fish that have eyes or travel .
“ Fahrenheit was a Pollock , ” Rosa uttered audibly , to no one in particular , although Quentin was also sitting in the hot room with two eyes .
“ Poland is not hot , ” Rosa colluded , exhaling the air that had been in her lungs for a few seconds before she talked chillingly about the temperature man .
“ This is a hot room , ” she finished , forecasting a way of saying to Quentin that the heat of the enormous room was like an angry animal that moved like a more slow animal and with eyes like scissors or not .
Quentin silently acknowledged her fiery observations with keen intelligence and iced tea in a small man - like hand which was still attached cunningly to one arm .
So was the other one , white with wise countenance of being in this precarious room with the woman I mentioned earlier .
It was still really hot , certainly .
Not getting enough Holy crap ! in your life ?
Then try this on for size :
Holy crap !
Oh yes , you definitely want to click on that to embiggen the heck out of it .
This teeny 610 pixel wide version does nothing to give you the sense of awe and glory in this spectacular picture .
The full size image is a whopping 7227 x 3847 pixels !
Warning : you 'll lose an hour of your life gaping at it .
That , duh , is Saturn , taken by the ever - amazing Cassini spacecraft .
It 's actually 75 different exposures stitched together , and was taken on August 12 , just a little over a day after Saturnian equinox , when the Sun shines straight along the rings .
The illumination from the Sun is about the same everywhere , but on the left the rings are illuminated by Saturn - shine glowing down on them , making them a bit brighter .
This picture keeps on giving , too .
You can spot several moons if you look in the embiggenatisized version ( most obvious is Janus on the left ; all of the moons have had their brightness enhanced to make them more easily visible in this image ) .
You can also see the subtle swirls and whorls of storms in Saturn 's upper atmosphere .
And what 's that dark line on Saturn 's equator ?
That 's the shadow of the rings themselves , narrowed to a thin line due to the Sun angle .
Holy crap .
And yet , there 's more .
Check .
This .
Out .
[ Update ; Oops : I got this image mixed up with another .
I 've struck through the old mistake , but leave it up as evidence that I blew it here .
It happens sometimes .
Sorry about the confusion , and my thanks to Joe Mason CICLOPS Media Relations Coordinator , for pointing out my error . ]
This is an old image ( taken by Cassini in 2005 ) that shows a long streak , which I 've highlighted with red arrows .
New images taken in the past month at Saturnian equinox confirm that this streak is actually an expanding cloud of debris from the impact of a small meteoroid , probably about a meter across and moving at several dozen kilometers / second .
It came in almost exactly parallel to the rings , leaving a path of wreckage and destruction many thousands of kilometers long .
This image , also taken at equinox , shows an elongated streak , marked by the red arrows .
That streak , it 's been determined , is actually from the impact of a small meteoroid , probably about a meter across and moving at several dozen kilometers / second .
It came in almost exactly parallel to the rings ,
As the debris cloud expanded , different orbital motions sheared it , leaving a path of wreckage and destruction 5000 kilometers long .
[ Update II :
My thanks to Carolyn Porco for pointing out this explanation to me in the comments . ]
Can I hear one final holy crap ?
The image here was enhanced to bring out the streak .
It turns out old images had similar streaks , but at the time they were n't sure what they were .
It 's been thought for a long time that the rings were constantly bombarded by interplanetary interlopers , and now we have pretty good proof .
This also makes me think this picture of Saturn 's rings from August really does show some object slamming into them at speeds dozens of times faster than a rifle bullet .
Cassini has been orbiting Saturn since 2004 , and these images show the true power of being able to go to a place and stay there , taking picture after picture for many years .
Every picture has a use , and old images can be reinterpreted when new data come in .
And we keep learning !
Saturn is a forbidding , remote , fascinating , and enchantingly beautiful world , with secrets and surprises to keep us guessing and fascinated for decades .
I 'm very glad Cassini is there bring us these delights .
Dobbs fill - in Kitty Pilgrim brought on Obama birther crazies Orly Taitz and Alan Keyes to discuss the legitimacy of President Obama 's birth certificate , because apparently the producers of Dobbs show thought the two of them somehow had something meaningful to add to that conversation .
Little wonder after watching Dobbs ' piece the other night where he was claiming " new questions are being raised about Obama 's citizenship " .
Who better to trot in there than the Queen Bee of the birthers Orly Taitz for a follow up ?
And for an double dose of the crazy , Alan Keyes to boot .
To Pilgrim 's credit , she did do a pretty good job of thoroughly debunking the birth certificate conspiracy theory before the guests were allowed to weigh in , and she and their two sane guests , John Avlon and Errol Lewis , stopped Taitz from talking over everyone as she was attempting to do for the entire segment .
Pilgrim quoted a number sources including FactCheck.org 's article
The truth about Obama 's birth certificate which should have laid this nonsense to rest :
FactCheck.org staffers have now seen , touched , examined and photographed the original birth certificate .
We conclude that it meets all of the requirements from the State Department for proving U.S. citizenship .
Claims that the document lacks a raised seal or a signature are false .
We have posted high - resolution photographs of the document as " supporting documents " to this article .
Our conclusion : Obama was born in the U.S.A. just as he has always said .
Of course that was n't good enough for Taitz or Keyes who blathered on as though they did n't hear a word Pilgrim just said .
Despite Pilgrim 's debunking of the rumor on tonight 's show , I 've got to wonder if Dobbs will follow suit when he returns given he was on his radio show as recently as July 15th saying that Obama needs to produce a birth certificate .
From Media Matters .
Transcript below the fold .
PILGRIM : Well , an Army Reserve major is again raising controversy over President Obama 's place of birth .
Now , the major challenged his deployment orders claiming that President Obama was n't born in the United States , and that renders his orders illegal .
Now , a former presidential candidate , Alan Keyes , also filed a lawsuit challenging the president 's right to hold the office , and a hearing on that suit will be held on Monday .
Now , questions about the president 's place of birth have been asked and answered many times since before the election , and the president 's birth certificate says he was born in Hawaii .
The state 's Republic governor and other officials have backed that up .
CNN has fully investigated the issue , found no basis for the questions about the president 's birthplace , but the controversy lives on , especially on the Internet .
Joining me now is Orly Taitz and she represents the Army major and filed the Keyes ' lawsuit .
Former presidential candidate Alan Keyes joins us .
And on the other side , , John Avlon who is a columnist with the DailyBeast.com and author of " Independent Nation . "
And Errol Louis , columnist for the " New York Daily News " and a CNN , also an attorney .
And so , let me , just before we start , bear with me a bit .
There 's overwhelming evidence that proves that his birth certificate is real and that was born in Honolulu on August 4 , 1961 .
And if you 'll just bear with me , I 'll run through a little bit of the evidence and then we can get to this discussion .
Now , the Annenberg political fact check , which is a nonpartisan group , went to Chicago to view the birth certificate last year and they released photos and this statement , " FactCheck.org staffers have now seen , touched , examined and photographed the original birth certificate .
We conclude that it meets all of the requirements from the State Department for proving U.S. citizenship .
Our conclusion : Obama was born in the USA , just has he has always said . "
The Republican governor of Hawaii , Linda Lingle , on record , she says Obama was indeed born in her state and we should note , she did support John McCain .
So , we also have a copy of the " Honolulu Advertiser " the newspaper , August 13 , and the " Hawaii Star - Bulletin , " August 14 , 1961 , both announcing Barack Obama 's birth .
Also , October last year , the director of the Hawaii Department of Health wrote a letter stating , " I have personally seen and verified that the Hawaii State Department of Health has Senator Obama 's original birth certificate on record in accordance with state policies and procedure . "
PolitiFact.com reissued their results from the investigation they conducted in June of last year and they say , " Since we published Obama 's birth certificate , questions about its authenticity have been frequent and fierce .
After reviewing the evidence , we are confident of our rulings . "
This is the last one , thanks for bearing with me .
The White House press briefing this week , reporter from the " World Net Daily " pressed again about the birth certificate , the White House press secretary , Robert Gibbs , said this following comment :
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
ROBERT GIBBS , WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECY :
Do all of your listeners and the listeners throughout this country the service to which any journalist owes those listeners , and that is the pursuit of the Nobel Truth , and the Noble Truth is that the president was born in Hawaii , a state of the United States of America .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
PILGRIM : Now , Alan Keyes , you 've been patient letting me get through all that , but what more do you need to be convinced ?
( LAUGHTER )
ALAN KEYES , FMR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE : Some evidence .
And the evidence is something that president Obama is strenuously blocking .
You ask me to prove that I was born in New York City at the time and hospital I say , and I will give you a certified copy of a full birth certificate with a doctor 's signature , the hospital , and everything else .
I wo n't direct you to some photograph on the Internet and a bunch of hearsay statements that would not be accepted as evidence in any court of law .
And so the very simple question is , why spend 800,000 to a million dollars blocking the birth certificate ?
Blocking records at school and college that would in any way have a bearing on the question ...
PILGRIM : All right , Alan ...
KEYES : Both of his birth and of his citizenship claims at various times in his life .
Why is he going to all this trouble , if as they say , the matter is resolved ?
Ca n't be resolved by a bunch of statements and assertions .
PILGRIM : OK , Orly , we have to keep this quicker , but please tell me ...
ORLY TAITZ , ATTORNEY : OK , Obama never provided his birth certificate .
What he provided is certification of live birth that was issued last year that does not have the name of the doctor , does not have the name of the hospital , does not have any signatures .
Do you know that Hawaii has a statute 338 , that allows foreign - born children of Hawaiian residence to get Hawaiian birth certificates .
Did you know that ?
PILGRIM : Errol , I would like you to respond .
ERROL LOUIS , NEW YORK DAILY NEWS : Listen , I think -- I think what we have here is a case where under the guise of saying , well , we can't trust whether or not he should be president because we do n't have the evidence , it 's actually the reverse .
These are folks , and there are a number of them , and some of them are raising money like " World Net Daily " which is as far as I 'm concerned , running a scam , where they 're selling all kinds of bumper stickers and stuff like that , and I do n't know what Miss Taitz is taking in the way of legal fees .
( CROSSTALK )
They 're raising legal fees from across the country and the reality is they do n't accept that the president is the president , and , therefore , they work backward and there will never be enough proof to satisfy them .
PILGRIM : All right , John , I have to let ...
You 've offered a mountain of evidence in addition to two birth announcements .
That 's a pretty deep conspiracy .
What we have here , you know ...
( CROSSTALK )
JOHN AVLON , DAILYBEAST .COM : No , what we have here is Obama derangement syndrome .
This pathological hatred of the president posing as patriotism .
Ambassador Keyes says that President Obama has called him a radical communist .
You on your blog have repeatedly referred to the administration as Gestapo SS .
Which is it ?
Get your story straight .
Is he a Nazi or a communist ?
You guys are nuts .
PILGRIM : Orly , I have to ask you to let everyone at least have their say before you respond to it .
I believe we 're out of time , I 'm sorry to say .
( LAUGHTER )
Great discussion .
( CROSSTALK )
Orly Taitz , Alan Keyes , Errol Louis and John Avlon .
TAITZ : Let me say one more thing , in order to be the president , you have to have to have two parents that are citizens .
Obama 's father was never a citizen of this country .
PILGRIM : All right , Orly , we have to call it , there .
I 'm sorry .
Thank you very much , all of you , for joining in this very lively debate .
Aug. 13 , 2009  --
The scrabble over health care reform reached a new level of volume and vitriol as crowds confronted members of Congress at town hall meetings across the country .
As the health care debate rages , so too does speculation about what proposed legislation will mean for Americans ' health care choices .
Among the most hotly discussed issues have been charges that the proposed legislation would create so - called " death panels " to ration care for the old and infirm ; that it would use taxpayer dollars to fund abortions ; that its passage would mark the end of Medicare ; and that it would open the door to socialized medicine .
But how accurate are the assumptions ?
The White House says some are completely false .
It has set up a website it says is designed to separate fact from fiction when it comes to the potential changes in the country 's health care system .
Still , those on both sides of the political spectrum continue to trade blows over the perceived language of the bill .
To help clear up the confusion , ABC News Chief Medical Editor Dr. Timothy Johnson talked to Chris Cuomo on today 's Good Morning America about four of the most commonly expressed worries over the proposed health care legislation now being mulled by Congress .
Fact or Fiction : Will the Government Create " Death Panels " ?
Verdict : Fiction
One of the most controversial claims in the health care debate is that the health care reform bill would provide for " death panels " to decide whether sick seniors and children with birth defects should receive medical care .
But Johnson said there is no evidence of any such provision in the text of the health care bill .
The most likely explanation , he said , is that the rumors of such a provision spring from a misinterpretation of a proposal to offer Medicare patients an optional service known as " advanced care planning consultation . "
Such a service would help patients and their families discuss the potentially uncomfortable subject of end - of - life care with their doctors .
But it would not represent a " death panel . "
" This provision makes clear this is entirely voluntary for patients ; it is not mandatory , " Johnson said .
" Most surveys show seniors want this desperately from their doctors , and only very few get it ...
I think when seniors find out what this is really about , they 'll welcome it . "
Fact or Fiction : Will Tax Dollars Pay for Abortions ?
Verdict : Unclear
Another controversial issue – that of abortion – is also getting attention in the health care reform debate .
Many opponents of the proposed health care legislation say that the plan as it is written could end up subsidizing some abortions .
Johnson said that unlike some of the other assertions about the bill , the possibility that this could come to pass is still not clear .
" None of [ the bills ] say abortions should or could be paid for with tax dollars ; in fact , an amendment on one prohibits that , " he said .
" However , if you look at the language , it gets complicated .
It 's not crystal clear whether or not that could happen with a so - called ' public option , ' and even with private plans that might be subsidized by government , maybe abortion would be allowed . "
Still , Johnson said , the specific prohibition of tax money funding abortions raised in the amendment to the House bill may indeed preclude such a situation .
The current debate is not the first to swirl around the possibility of publicly funded abortions .
In 1976 , Congress passed what has become known as the Hyde amendment , a response to the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that prohibited the funding of abortions through Medicaid .
But whether this same stipulation would apply to other government health care programs remains unclear .
Fact or Fiction : Will Health Care Reform Eliminate Medicare ?
Verdict : Fiction
The idea that the proposed health care legislation would eliminate Medicare – a government program that currently provides health care for 44.8 million older Americans – has also taken center stage in recent weeks .
But Johnson said that seniors need not worry about such a situation .
" What seniors are hearing that seems to worry them [ is ] that President Obama talks about reforming Medicare or getting rid of waste , and they are worried his waste might be their need , " Johnson said .
Johnson said legislators must be careful to ensure that needed services are not affected .
But choosing instead not to cut out the waste in Medicare could lead to the program running out of money in the future , a situation he said would be even worse for seniors .
" The trick will be to cut the waste without cutting needed services , " he said .
Fact or Fiction : Is Obama Advocating Socialized Medicine ?
Verdict : Fiction
Some also assert that the proposed health care legislation is a first step toward " socialized medicine . "
But Johnson said such claims are off - base .
" True socialized medicine means the government not only finances , but also owns and operates the hospitals ; that is not going to happen in this country , " Johnson said .
" Almost all other industrialized countries have a combination of government regulation and private competition .
And that 's what the president is more or less advocating . "
Johnson said such an approach would be analogous to what is currently seen in the airline industry .
While the government heavily regulates the training of pilots and the inspection of planes , the actual business of providing air travel falls on the shoulders of private airline companies .
I ’ve noticed that the issue of all that pesky torture we did over the last 6 + years has been pretty quiet as of late .
I just wanted to re-post something I put up a while back to emphasize what kind of a strange bizzaro world we ’re living in right now .
Add this to the vast library of rank hypocrisy to greet us from the right .
Go back in the way - back machine and remember the days of Abu Ghraib .
Here was Bush speaking in an interview on al - Arabiya after the horrors were revealed :
It ’s important for people to understand that in a democracy , there will be a full investigation .
In other words , we want to know the truth .
In our country , when there ’s an allegation of abuse … there will be a full investigation , and justice will be delivered . …
It ’s very important for people and your listeners to understand that in our country , when an issue is brought to our attention on this magnitude , we act .
And we act in a way in which leaders are willing to discuss it with the media . …
In other words , people want to know the truth .
That stands in contrast to dictatorships .
A dictator would n’t be answering questions about this .
A dictator would n’t be saying that the system will be investigated and the world will see the results of the investigation .

Until the early 1990s , the voices to legalize drugs in the United States were not in sync .
This changed with Soros 's first foray into U.S. domestic politics in 1992 - 1993 .
Soros declared : " The war on drugs is doing more harm to our society than drug abuse itself , " and proceeded with his checkbook advocacy through his Open Society Institute ( OSI ) to give some $ 15 million to establish and fund several pro-drug legalization organizations .
Since then , he and his like - minded friends have poured many millions into different programs aimed at drug legalization .
George Soros must be thrilled .
Sixteen years after Soros began his advocacy for drug legalization and promoting " medical marijuana , " the National Institute on Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) is venturing into the distribution and production of marijuana cigarettes .
According to an August solicitation for proposals , the selected organizations will be controlled by the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) , and will have to comply with FDA regulations .
Proposals in response to bid N01DA - 10 - 7773 are due in to a Bethesda contracting office by October 9 , 2009 .
On Feb. 7 , 1996 , The Wall Street Journal observed that Soros 's " sponsorship unified the movement to legalize drugs and gave it the respectability and credibility it lacked . "
I then opined that unchallenged , Soros would change the political landscape in America .
But patiently , Soros has achieved what he set out to get .
Soros , whose motto is , " If I spend enough , I make it right , " uses his donations and philanthropy to change — or more accurately deconstruct — the moral values and attitudes of the Western world , and particularly of the American people .
While others give to the arts and higher education or to better the quality of the lives of their fellow men , Soros has been funding campaigns for drug legalization , and " medical marijuana , " which is described as a " compassionate drug . "
Soros and the other proponents of medical marijuana and drug legalization claim that the price of government - provided " legal " drugs would significantly lower their current price , removing the necessity to commit crimes in order to secure the drugs .
But how much would governmental administration add to the cost ?
And what will happen when the " tax " is added on ?
When the government outsources the production and distribution , would pharmaceutical and new marijuana cigarette producers be asked to give up their profits ?
How much would it cost to investigate the black market that will flourish supplying groups prohibited by law from receiving drugs — adolescents , airline pilots , police officers , etc . ?
This new industry could create jobs .
But are there going to be enough sober workers to perform them ?
NIDA 's solicitation for marijuana growth for research is nothing new .
Marijuana studies have been conducted over decades , and thousands of them document the adverse effects of this controlled ( illegal ? — it 's not controlled yet ) substance .
Yet , now , for the first time , the government is soliciting organizations that can grow marijuana on a " large scale , " with the capability to " prepare marijuana cigarettes and related products ... distribute marijuana , marijuana cigarettes and cannabinoids , and other related products " not only for research , but also for " other government programs . "
Since when is the U.S. government in the business of distributing marijuana cigarettes ?
Is this part of the health care programs the Obama administration is so keen to enforce ?
Since Obama took office , " medical marijuana " dispensary owners in some of the 15 states where it 's legal , or tolerated , report requests " climbed sky high . "
Medical Marijuana , Inc. , an Oregon - based company , which has been traded on the Nasdaq since April of 2009 , offers solutions for this emerging industry .
Its Web site claims that " the number of ailing people turning to medical marijuana to ease their symptoms has spiked in 2009 .
Requests have jumped anywhere from 50 percent to 300 percent . "
In California , where medical marijuana is already legal , a massive campaign is underway to legalize all uses of the drug .
Soros and other pro-drug legalization organizations claim that tax revenues from marijuana sales would fill the empty coffers of the state with at least $ 1.4 billion for the first year .
The more users , the more money for the state .
A revenue collection system is already in place to ensure the tax revenues for the states that allow " medical marijuana . "
The system , developed by Medical Marijuana , Inc. , boasts , " The Stored Value Platform System , a point - of - sale system , is a hallmark element of Medical Marijuana 's business solutions package . "
The company has already signed on many marijuana collectives , and lobbies heavily to sign on the City of Oakland , Calif. , which is the first city in the nation that voted in favor of collecting tax proceeds from marijuana sale , " as part of the solution to Oakland 's longstanding budget shortfall . "
California 's current attorney general is former Mayor Jerry Brown , who now runs for governor .
While he was governor of California from 1975 to 1983 , Brown lowered the fines on marijuana possession .
Yet , now he says , " If the whole society starts getting stoned , we 're going to be even less competitive . "
As for the harm caused by using marijuana , NIDA reports : " marijuana smoke contains 50 percent to 70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than does tobacco smoke ... which further increases the lungs ' exposure to carcinogenic smoke . "
Moreover , " marijuana users have a 4.8 - fold increase in the risk of heart attack in the first hour after smoking the drug ....
This risk may be greater in aging populations or those with cardiac vulnerabilities . "
In addition , marijuana use causes " distorted perceptions , impaired coordination , difficulty in thinking and problem solving , and problems with learning and memory , " lasting weeks after the initial use .
" As a result , someone who smokes marijuana every day may be functioning at a suboptimal intellectual level all of the time . "
If the government legitimizes marijuana use and develops a new marijuana cigarettes industry , Soros will no doubt boast that he had a part in this feat .
The evidence about the harm caused by marijuana to the individual user and society is overwhelming .
Yet the government is now moving for large production and distribution of marijuana .
If this is part of the ObamaCare project , it would surely cause the opposite of what it is purporting to do .
Cutting Edge contributor Rachel Ehrenfeld , author of Funding Evil : How Terrorism is Financed and How to Stop It , is director of the American Center for Democracy .
Gordon Brown faced fresh questions tonight after it emerged that he discussed with Colonel Gaddafi detailed conditions for the Lockerbie bomber 's return nearly six weeks ago , while senior Labour figures warned of an economic backlash from angry Americans " costing our country dear " .
Downing Street released the text of a cordial letter sent to the Libyan leader on the day that Abdulbaset al - Megrahi was released , asking that the event be kept low key because a " high - profile " ceremony would distress his victims and their families .
But critically the letter also refers to a meeting between the two leaders six weeks earlier at the G8 summit in Italy , adding that " when we met [ there ]
I stressed that , should the Scottish executive decide that Megrahi can return to Libya , this should be a purely private family occasion " rather than a public celebration .
Previously officials have said that the two men's conversation in Italy at the beginning of July was brief and that , while the Lockerbie case was raised , Brown merely stressed the matter was one for the Scottish government to decide .
However , the new letter , addressed to " Dear Muammar " and signed off by wishing him a happy Ramadan , suggests that the decision was well enough advanced and Brown well enough briefed to set terms for a homecoming – albeit unsuccessfully .
A jubilant Libyan crowd , some waving Scottish flags , greeted Megrahi at the airport .
Meanwhile , details emerged of a second letter written by the Foreign Office minister Ivan Lewis to the Scottish justice minister , Kenny MacAskill , confirming that there were no legal reasons not to let Megrahi go and concluding : " I hope on this basis you will now feel able to consider the Libyan application . "
Although the Foreign Office said it was not intended to make representations either way , the leaking of the letter suggests the SNP - led administration may be starting to fight back .
Tonight the shadow foreign secretary , William Hague , redoubled calls for the government to release official records of conversations about the release , as Gaddafi increased the embarrassment by publicly thanking " my friend Brown , his government , the Queen of Britain , Elizabeth , and Prince Andrew who all contributed to encouraging the Scottish government to take this historic and courageous decision " .
The scale of fury in America was laid bare in a vitriolic letter from the director of the FBI , Robert Mueller – who as a justice department lawyer led the investigation into the bombing – describing the release in a scathing letter to MacAskill as a " mockery of the rule of law " and of the victims ' grief .
However , the Scottish government last night responded defiantly , insisting the US had made clear in discussions that , while it opposed Megrahi 's release , it regarded freeing him on compassionate grounds because of his terminal cancer as " far preferable " to a prisoner transfer deal that would have seen him in custody .
Fears that the US could retaliate against the British government were eased when Whitehall sources disclosed that the White House had made no complaint to Downing Street , reserving its ire for the Scottish administration .
However , public anger at scenes of the convicted bomber receiving a hero 's welcome has prompted demands from ordinary Americans for economic reprisals , with two websites set up to promote a boycott and angry Americans discussing on Twitter which products they should avoid , from Scotch whisky to Highland holidays .
Senior Scottish Labour figures say that MacAskill 's references in his original statement last week to the compassion of Scotland 's people had turned the entire country , which earns £ 260 m a year through American tourists , into an economic target .
Iain Gray , Labour leader in Scotland , said : " Those calling for a boycott of Scotland are emboldened by [ MacAskill 's ] foolish claim that the decision was taken in the name of the people of Scotland .
In seeking to portray this as a decision supported by the whole of the country , he has damaged Scotland 's reputation .
It shows serious lack of judgment which has cost our country dear . "
Jack McConnell , the former Labour first minister , said the decision damaged Scotland in a way " that will take years to recover " and called on MSPs to show it did not have popular support .
A spokesman for the Scotch Whisky Association said it was " monitoring " the situation , but hoped that initial anger would pass , as it has done in past protests .
" We hope that people recognise that this is not necessarily the solution . "
The business secretary , Lord Mandelson , left hospital today – where he was recovering from a prostate operation – insisting it was " completely wrong " and " offensive " to suggest that Megrahi 's release was linked to trade deals over oil and gas .
Mandelson met Gaddafi's son during a holiday in Corfu this month , several weeks after the prime minister 's meeting in Italy , and has admitted the Lockerbie issue was raised .
Today he said the Libyans had had " the same response from me as they would have had from any other member of the government " .
MacAskill will give a statement on Monday to the Scottish parliament , which has been recalled from recess .
He is likely to face tough questioning on why the convicted bomber was not transferred to a Libyan jail .
McConnell said it was a " big if " to suggest that the convicted bomber deserved compassionate treatment but even then , allowing Megrahi " to be welcomed home in Libya as a free man should have been the last option on the list .
There were other options that could have been applied if the Scottish government had the will . "
However , Monday 's session could also examine the political manoeuvrings around the deal , with MacAskill said to believe that he was set up by the British government 's refusal to respond to his consultation .
Yesterday John Bolton , former US ambassador to the UN , also called for a congressional hearing into how the US government lobbied Britain over the issue , which could shed new light on the British response .
As you may know , Belgium has 3 native languages : French , German and Dutch .
Lately , people tend to make a big fuzz about this .
Political party ’s started creating diversity based on these languages to use this in their own advantage ( votes ) .
The media has added its share to this too .
I personally do n’t mind all these easy and low ways of getting attention .
But now the discussion has appeared as a burden inside our Ubuntu - be LUG as well .
We have this policy that you can talk French , Dutch , German and English as you please .
As a ( logical ) result , most of the communication has been done in English .
By doing so , we can reach most of the users .
If someone sends a mail to the mailing in one of the three other languages , no one bothers .
But the pool of people that understands the message is significantly lower .
In the mailing list this has now been discussed as a problem .
There was a reaction from someone on our mailing list :
1 . Het consequente gebruik van het Engels .
Dit is België , en hier zijn 3 officiële landstalen : Nederlands , Frans en Duits .
Het gebruik van het Engels is dan ook compleet belachelijk , temeer daar een grote meerderheid niet eens deftig Engels kan schrijven ( ja , ik ben een taalpurist ) .
Ben je niet tweetalig ?
Of zitten er mensen op de lijst die niet tweetalig zijn ?
Begrijpelijk , maar dat brengt me meteen bij punt 2 . 2 . Ubuntu - be : waarom niet opsplitsen in een Ubuntu - vla en een Ubuntu - wal ( bijvoorbeeld ) .
Zo het sowieso veel makkelijker maken , aangezien Vlaanderen en Wallonië ( o.a. ) qua bedrijfscultuur totaal verschillend zijn ( ik heb in beide landsdelen gewerkt ) .
Now let me try to translate this to English :
1 . The consequent use of English .
This is Belgium , and there are 3 official languages : Dutch , French and German .
The use of English is thus complete ridiculous .
Even more because a larger group of people can't even write decent English .
( Yes , I 'm a language purist )
Are n't you bilingual ?
Or are there people on the list that are not ?
I can understand , but that brings me immediately at point 2 . 2 . Ubuntu - be : Why not split into Ubuntu- vla and Ubuntu - wal as an example ) ?
This would facilitate things , as Flanders ( vla ) and Walons ( wal ) , to name something , have totally different company / business cultures .
( I worked in both parts of the country )
So I started thinking about this and got to the conclusion : “ Should we even care ? ”
For what I ’m concerned , things are fine like they are .
That seemed to be the same conclusion as someone else who replied :
Also , considering that we barely have enough volunteers now , how do you expect us to have enough volunteers if we split up in 4 or more different groups ?
To give one point - of - reference : Jean , who 's been coordinating most of the computer fair booths recently , is French - speaking natively , but living in Flanders ( and he speaks Dutch very well ! ) .
Why would we want him to limit his work to Flanders , and not Wallonia or Brussels ?
He nailed it !
Why are grownups even discussing such a trivial thing ?
In Belgium , we all learned English and French , so I ca n’t see a difficulty in a multilingual community .
Au contraire , this could be a positive point as our work will be more useful to other LUG’s .
But perhaps I ’m wrong .
I wonder if there are other LUG ’s out there that have the same problem ?
Do people in Quebec have issues with this ?
Do people from the middle - east have issues like this ?
( they have a lot of dialects )
It would be nice get the opinion or the results from similar problems inside Ubuntu / Linux LUG’s .
Rations have already been cut by a third since July last year
The UN has warned that it has run out of food to provide for nine million Ethiopians who rely on its assistance .
A UN spokesman told the BBC the port of Djibouti was seriously congested and there was little prospect of supplies arriving for the next five months .
Following a border war , Ethiopia does not use Eritrean ports and the landlocked country relies on Djibouti .
However , Ethiopia 's ambassador to the UK has denied that his country is facing a food crisis .
Berhanu Kebede told the BBC's World Today programme that food was being transported by truck from Sudan .
Correspondents say this time of year is known as " the hunger season " , three months before the next harvest .
The UN World Food Programme says breast - feeding mothers , children and refugees will be among those worst hit .

It warns after it hands out final rations this month there will be no further deliveries until September or October .
The agency says it has no option but to cut back on the food they provide , which has already been cut by a third since July 2008 .
" We have a small refugee population here and their ration is being cut by half beginning this month .
We run out of food and people will be very hungry , " WFP 's Barry Came told the BBC .
BBC Africa analyst Martin Plaut says in the jargon of the aid agencies , the food pipeline has ruptured .
The port of Djibouti is full to overflowing and the Ethiopian government has prioritised the delivery of fertiliser , to try to increase the next harvest .
But even when the grain gets through , the WFP says there is an acute shortage of trucks , with the Ethiopian authorities preventing the agency from bringing in its own fleet from Sudan .

A " chemical wringer " developed by researchers in Florida leaves clothes 20 percent drier than a normal wash , and could save consumers millions in electricity bills .
A novel mix of common detergent ingredients that lowers the surface tension in liquids could force extra water from clothes during the final spin cycle , the researchers found .
Dinesh Shah , director of the Center for Surface Science and Engineering at the University of Florida , and Ph.D. student Daniel Carter noticed that cloth fibers act like tiny capillaries , stubbornly holding onto water through the spin cycle .
By lowering the surface tension – the force that keeps water in a straw when one end is closed with a finger – water drained more easily from these fiber capillaries .
The researchers found they could lower surface tension by mixing common surfactants in a new way – five parts lauryl sulfate to one part dioctyldecyldimethyl ammonium bromide .
" We call it dodab , " Carter said .
Carter tested the compound using a washing machine in his lab .
He compared the weight of clothes after a standard wash against those washed with the new compound .
The researchers will publish their results in the journal Langmuir .
Clothes dryers accounted for 5.8 percent of U.S. residential electricity in 2001 , according to figures from the Energy Information Administration , costing $ 5.6 billion .
" If you could cut that down by 10 percent , that would have a important impact on the big picture , " said Jonathan Cogan , an EIA spokesman .
Carter says they can do even better : " I believe that with further research , we could cut drying times by between 30 and 40 percent . "
Carter said he believes the research will lead to a product , although he could n't say when .
The research was funded by a $ 200,000 grant from Procter & Gamble .
The University of Florida applied for a patent on the compound and will license it to P&G .
" This would have a big impact on national residential usage , " said the EIA 's Cogan , " but I 'm not sure how big an impact it would have on individual households .
You would need to do a more detailed analysis , and it would depend how much a product like this would cost . "
He added that most American households use less - efficient top loaders , but front - loading machines that use less water and energy are becoming more popular , which could compound the energy savings .
This is the sixth in a series of seven 2009 college football story lines .
Next week , columnist Chris Dufresne begins a daily countdown of his preseason top 25 .
A segment we ’re calling : fresh coaching faces in new pigskin places .
Impact meter : Upgrade
1. Washington .
Steve Sarkisian replaces Tyrone Willingham .
Sark , moving up the coast from Pete Carroll ’s staff at USC , swims violently upstream as he inherits a winless 2008 squad that opens the season at home against Louisiana State .
Jake Locker ’s return to quarterback this year after an injury - plagued 2008 , though , should be worth at least three wins .
Advertisement
2. Syracuse .
Doug Marrone replaces Greg Robinson .
The man Marrone replaces was 10 - 37 in four seasons , so you can understand the switch .
Opening against Minnesota , Penn State and Northwestern , however , is not the way you want to break in the new guy .
3. New Mexico State .
DeWayne Walker replaces Hal Mumme .
Walker , the former UCLA defensive coordinator , takes on possibly the worst major - college job .
Yet , the man who orchestrated UCLA ’s 13 - 9 upset win over USC in 2006 is talented enough to parlay this into a better gig .
Impact meter :
Slight upgrade
Advertisement
1. Kansas State .
Bill Snyder replaces Ron Prince .
Snyder , in his first stint in Manhattan , led Kansas State to the most amazing turnaround in college football history .
But he ’s 70 and running against the game clock .
2. Mississippi State .
Dan Mullen replaces Sylvester Croom .
Mullen , a former offensive guru at Florida , ushers the spread offense to Starkville in an attempt to jump - start what many people believe is the hardest place to win in the SEC .
3. San Diego State .
Brady Hoke for Chuck Long .
Unlike Long , who was 9 - 27 in three seasons , Hoke arrives from Ball State with head coaching experience .
It ’s still San Diego State , though , which continues to underperform despite great weather , a solid recruiting base and terrific fish tacos .
Successor - in- waiting transitions
Advertisement
1. Oregon .
Chip Kelly replaces Mike Bellotti .
The Ducks ’ dynamic spread offense should not be hampered by the departure of Bellotti , who moved to the athletic director job after hand - plucking Kelly out of New Hampshire .
2. Purdue .
Danny Hope replaces Joe Tiller .
Hope inherits a 4 - 8 team that lost star quarterback Curtis Painter , so it might take a year or two to see whether this succession plan was a success .
You changed coaches . . . why ?
1 and 1 - A. Tennessee / Auburn .
Lane Kiffin replaces Phil Fulmer ; Gene Chizik subs in for Tommy Tuberville .
Only in the SEC do you run two coaches off who were a combined 145 games over .500 , but Fulmer had n’t won a national title since 1998 and Tuberville had n’t gone 13 - 0 since 2004 .
Advertisement
Kiffin has proved to be a deft director of marketing , using the old Hollywood edict that “ there ’s no such thing as bad publicity , ” even if it costs you a few NCAA secondary violations .
Chizik gets a head - coaching do - over after making the regrettable choice of once leaving Mack Brown ’s Texas staff for Iowa State .

Some of the world 's top footwear brands , including Clarks , Adidas , Nike and Timberland , have demanded an immediate moratorium on destruction of the Amazon rainforest from their leather suppliers in Brazil .
The move is the first major development since the Guardian revealed a three - year undercover investigation by Greenpeace in June .
The investigation said leading Brazilian suppliers of leather and beef for products sold in Britain had obtained cattle from farms involved in illegal deforestation .
" The decision is good news , " said Carlos Minc , Brazil 's environment minister .
" With government pressure on one side and with the pressure of the consumer on the other , we have started to close in on [ environmental ] criminals . "
" It 's great progress in a very short space of time , " said Greenpeace 's James Turner .
" What this does now is really put pressure on the UK food companies .
The shoe companies have realised there is a problem and taken action , now it 's up to the supermarkets to follow that lead . "
Clearing tropical forests for agriculture is estimated to produce 17 % of the world 's carbon emissions – more than the global transport system .
Cattle farming is now the biggest threat to the remaining Amazon rainforest , a fifth of which has been lost since 1970 .
" I 'd say that 65 - 75 % of deforestation is linked to the growth of ranching , " Minc said .
" We are closing in on this , but it is still the sector that is most opposed to change and responsible for the most deforestation in the Amazon . "
Ed Miliband , the energy and climate change secretary , who is in the Amazon on an unrelated diplomatic trip , said : " We can only get an agreement on climate change if it involves Brazil and it involves forestry .
There is no solution to the question of climate change without forestry .
The Amazon forest is such a beautiful place when it is untouched and then you see these scars on the landscape from the deforestation , bigger and bigger scars . "
In addition to the moratorium on leather from newly deforested areas , the footwear makers have also demanded that suppliers bring in a stringent traceability system within a year , which will " credibly " guarantee the source of all leather .
Last night , one large supplier agreed to ensure that the farms it takes cattle from are not responsible for deforestation .
Bertin , one of Brazil 's - and the world 's - major suppliers of leather and beef also agreed to meet Greenpeace this month to negotiate how to prevent cattle ranching from driving deforestation .
The Greenpeace investigation compiled field work , government records , company documents and trade data from Brazil , China , Europe , Vietnam and the US to piece together the global movement of leather and meat from Brazilian cattle .
The organisation said cattle from hundreds of legal and illegal farms across the Amazon were mixed and processed on their way to export sites , making it currently impossible to trace the origins of products .
" In effect , criminal or ' dirty ' supplies of cattle are ' laundered ' through the supply chain , " said the report .
Greenpeace has asked companies to refuse to buy from such suppliers and for consumers to press supermarkets and high street brands to clean up the supply chains .
It said that some Brazilian processing companies exported products linked to Amazon destruction to dozens of blue - chip companies across the world , and named three major processors , Bertin , JBS and Marfrig , which together control a third of Brazilian beef exports .
" We all agree [ preventing deforestation ] is possible , " Leonardo Swirski , head of Bertin 's leather division , told the Guardian last night .
But he warned against measures that would harm the livelihoods of the 20 million people in the Amazon region .
" If all [ consumers ] are not buying any products from the Amazon , they will surely create other sorts of problems . "
He believes other supply companies will also take action : " We have an advantage if they do n't .
I believe everyone will follow . "
JBS and Marfrig reiterated commitments to not sourcing cattle from illegally deforested land , and all three have agreed with the federal prosecutor to reject these cattle .
Marcus O'Sullivan , a director in JBS 's London office , said : " We are very committed to the protection of the Amazon biome .
We work closely with Ibama [ the Brazilian ministry of defence 's enforcement agency ] and do n't purchase cattle from the blacklisted farms . "
Under the moratorium , the footwear companies will refuse to buy leather sourced from farms on both legally and illegally deforested land .
It will be extended if the demand for credible traceability is not in place within a year .
Clarks , which is a major customer of Bertin , said in a statement : " Clarks will require suppliers of Brazilian leather to certify , in writing , that they are not supplying leather from recently deforested areas in the Amazon biome . "
Timberland said : " We are grateful for the work of NGOs such as Greenpeace in exposing problems deep within the Brazilian leather supply chain . "
Adidas said : " We believe that joining together with our industry partners in this effort ensures an ongoing and sustainable method to stop deforestation in the Amazon biome region . "

The “ problem ” with humanity , if you want it in a nutshell , is that we can choose what to believe and we can choose to ignore a necessary activity for a fun one .
While we might expect that behavior from orangutans and chimpanzees , our closest relatives , we also see it all the time in humanity .
As Matt Thomas says in his classic article , “ Why free software usability tends to suck ” :
Volunteers hack on stuff which they are interested in , which usually means stuff which they are going to use themselves .
Because they are hackers , they are power users , so the interface design ends up too complicated for most people to use .
The converse also applies .
Many of the little details which improve the interface â€ ” like focusing the appropriate control when a window is opened , or fine - tuning error messages so that they are both helpful and grammatical â€ ” are not exciting or satisfying to work on , so they get fixed slowly ( if at all ) .
MPT ( archived )
Translated from his somewhat delicate reference : people only do what they find fun .
Of course , this is a powerful motivational tool , if we can make things fun .
But some just are n’t going to be .
Our current means of controlling that is an economic system where some get to live the life divine and do the fun stuff , and others do n’t have to .
Mostly , it sorts them by competence , so it works better than the option , which is state assigned jobs and uniform rewards ( raw socialism ) .
But there are still tasks that need doing , if we want our tools and technologies to be top notch .
It ’s about completion : any job undertaken needs to be completed in whole , including interface and the difficult task of long - term design , including ancillary effects .
Even more than “ fun , ” we have a problem in that we can choose — using our big brains — to deny ideas or evidence that we find displeasing .
Witness :
I was in Calcutta when the cyclone struck East Bengal in November 1970 .
Early dispatches spoke of 15,000 dead , but the estimates rapidly escalated to 2,000,000 and then dropped back to 500,000 .
A nice round number : it will do as well as any , for we will never know .
The nameless ones who died , “ unimportant ” people far beyond the fringes of the social power structure , left no trace of their existence .
Pakistani parents repaired the population loss in just 40 days , and the world turned its attention to other matters .
1
What killed those unfortunate people ?
The cyclone , newspapers said .
But one can just as logically say that overpopulation killed them .
The Gangetic Delta is barely above sea level .
Every year several thousand people are killed in quite ordinary storms .
If Pakistan were not overcrowded , no sane man would bring his family to such a place .
Ecologically speaking , a delta belongs to the river and the sea ; man obtrudes there at his peril .
In the web of life every event has many antecedents .
Only by an arbitrary decision can we designate a single antecedent as “ cause . ”
Our choice is biased â€ ” biased to protect our egos against the onslaught of unwelcome truths .
As T.S. Eliot put it in Burnt Norton :
Go , go , go , said the bird : human kind
Cannot bear very much reality .
Were we to identify overpopulation as the cause of a half - million deaths , we would threaten ourselves with a question to which we do not know the answer :
How can we control population without recourse to repugnant measures ?
Fearfully we close our minds to an inventory of possibilities .
Instead , we say that a cyclone caused the deaths , thus relieving ourselves of responsibility for this and future catastrophes .
“ Fate ” is so comforting .
Every year we list tuberculosis , leprosy , enteric diseases , or animal parasites as the “ cause of death ” of millions of people .
It is well known that malnutrition is an important antecedent of death in all these categories ; and that malnutrition is connected with overpopulation .
But overpopulation is not called the cause of death .
We cannot bear the thought .
Garrett Hardin Society
What is the result of our ignoring the cause / effect relationships in reality ?
We pick effects that are comforting to our notion of personality as being in control of its world , and then we declare those important and the rest not .
The resulting focus on the “ thing - in - itself , ” or viewing objects as the causes of their roles in a larger context , allows us to deal harshly with immediate problems but completely ignore anything with a long - term consequence .
As Rowan Hooper wrote in an excellent article called “ Is Earth set to go silent in the next hundred years ? ” :
But in his conclusion [ Rees ] got into truly cosmic realms , by offering his answer to a question he is often asked :
Does astronomy offer any special extra perspective on our terrestrial lives ?
Astronomers can set our home planet in a vast cosmic context : a backdrop of millions of galaxies , each containing billions of planets .
And we know that every atom in our body was forged in an ancient star somewhere in the Milky way .
We are literally the ashes of long - dead stars – the nuclear waste from the fuel that makes stars shine .
To understand ourselves , we must understand the atoms we ’re made of – but we must also understand the stars that made those atoms .
But there ’s something else that astronomers can offer : an awareness of an immense future .
The stupendous timespans of the evolutionary past are now part of common culture .
We ’re the outcome of more than four billion years of evolution .
But most people still perceive humans as the culmination of the evolutionary tree .
That hardly seems credible to me as an astronomer .
Our Sun ’s less than half way through its life .
Darwinian evolution surely has n’t run its course .
Any creatures witnessing the Sun ’s demise 6 billion years hence wo n’t be human – they ’ll be as different from us as we are from a bug .
Posthuman evolution – here on Earth and far beyond , organic or silicon - based – could be as prolonged as the Darwinian evolution that ’s led to us – and even more wonderful .
Rees ended by taking the viewpoint of an alien that had been watching our planet .
It would , he said , have seen carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rising “ anomalously fast , due to burning of fossil fuels ” .
Will these hypothetical watching aliens see the Earth go silent in the next hundred years ?
This brings us back to the question : what is the human dilemma that keeps us from seeing and acting on these problems ?
As Hardin points out , we tend to pick and choose about where we attribute cause .
It ’s much easier to blame the hurricane , which was the immediate prior act , than the situation which made the hurricane able to wipe out many .
Similarly , it ’s easy to finger government , a vast conspiracy ( if you ’re a leftist , it ’s racist white male capitalists ; if you ’re a rightist , it ’s anti-white socialists ) controlling society , the rich , the poor , etc .
Could it be humanity ’s epitaph will be six billion voices chanting in unison , in every language , “ It ’s not my fault ” ?
Could it be the solution to our problems is one that we ’ve overlooked because it ’s so obvious — to stop being polite about truth , to insist on it , and to insist on a design - level look at cause and effect ?
That will offend many — but we presume is a lesser fate than extinguishing ourselves .

What a great way to start the day , finally we see some real concept designs for the upcoming Tron Legacy movie aside from the poor quality bootleg video posted online a year ago .
These were released yesterday at the San Diego Comic Con .
Simply beautiful .
Nice glassy monochromatic architecture and landscapes with the iconic blue glowing lines .
That bike image ( 2nd from the bottom ) is blowing my mind .
And just a reminder , we also have a Daft Punk original score for the movie to look forward to .
Big Thanks to Kyle Crane for bringing these to my attention via Twitter .
Update : Abother big thanks to my pal Matt Morgan for bringing the above video to my attention .
The unvealing of the light cycle at the San Diego Comic Con .
I think the guys reaction says it all :)
There ’s a scene in “ Bruno ” where Sacha Baron Cohen holds an audition for the “ hottest baby photo shoot ever . ”
The intent is to reveal how fame - seeking parents will agree to anything — including putting their babies in fast cars without a car seat or next to “ dead or dying animals ” — to get their toddlers on camera .
It would be astonishing … if it had n’t already become so common on the small screen .
On shows such as “ Supernanny , ” “ Wife Swap , ” “ Denise Richards — It ’s Complicated , ” “ My Dad Is Better Than Your Dad , ” and “ Kid Nation ” and others , the harmful effects that come from constantly being on camera at a young age is becoming a matter of concern to child - care professionals and even fans of some shows .
And did we mention “ Jon & Kate Plus 8 ” ?
Even in this tabloid era , the disintegration of the Gosselins ’ marriage and the effect the TLC show and the media attention is having on the couple ’s young sextuplets and twins has family and show followers warning that things have gone too far .
Kate ’s brother and her sister - in - law , Kevin and Jodi Krieder , both of whom have appeared on the show , recently told CBS that they believed the children are “ being exploited ” by parents obsessed with “ fame and the fortune . ”
While empirical data to gauge the effect of nonstop media exposure on children is hard to come by , the anecdotal evidence does n’t look good — even if the ratings are great .
* Paul and Susan Young accused “ Supernanny ” producers of encouraging their five sons to exaggerate their unruly behavior for the cameras on the U.K. version of the series in 2005 .
" They left us with children that were more naughty than when they arrived , " the mother told the British press .
The fact that the Young ’s house might have been burned down by one of the children in 2007 certainly did n’t help .
* “ The Real Housewives of Orange County ’s ” Gina DeLeon believes that appearing on the show had " a devastating effect " for her children , who were not on the show initially .
When series regular Laurie Waring hooked up with Gina ’s ex-husband George Peterson on season 2 , he wanted to the kids to join him in front of the cameras .
" They begged not to be on it , " DeLeon told TheWrap , but " George forced them to do it . ”
DeLeon added that the children “ got teased and bullied at school , it was not a pleasant or growing experience for them . "
* Professionals like Charlie Sheen and Pamela Anderson have consciously kept their children off their reality TV excursions .
Sheen even fought an unsuccessful legal battle to keep his young daughters off his ex-wife Denise Richard ’s E! series .
( For more on celebrity reality TV shows and children , see accompanying story . )
“ These shows can open the kids to a level of public scrutiny , of shame and of failure , ” notes Dr. Drew Pinsky , host of VH - 1 ’s “ Celeb Rehab and co-author of " The Mirror Effect : How Celebrity Narcissism Is Seducing America . "
“ You have to ask yourself if that is conducive to positive outcomes as they get older . ”
Pinsky puts the responsibility on the parents and the producers .
“ Children ca n’t give informed consent by definition , only the parents can do that — and reality shows generally do n’t cast adults who have the highest level of mental health .
They are severe narcissists who are obsessed with celebrity . ”
“ The permanency of the images of the children potty training , bathing and having temper tantrums on camera will open them up to derision and bullying as they get older , ” says Paul Peterson , who starred in “ The Donna Reed Show ” in the late 50s and 60s .
For Peterson — who with his nonprofit group A Minor Consideration has been a long - time advocate of safeguarding Hollywood ’s on - camera children — long - term pain is the likely consequence of short - term fame .
“ Down the line , once the show is over and the cameras have gone , ” he asserts , “ there will likely be no help for them from predators and others seeking to take advantage of them . ”
There is , however , some possible help on the way .
“ Jon & Kate Plus 8 ’s ” treatment of the Gosselin children is now being investigated by the Pennsylvania Labor Department .
“ We received a complaint , and an investigator has been assigned , ” Department spokesman Troy Thompson told TheWrap .
“ Now we ’re reviewing the case , which means interviewing the principles , interviewing anyone who has information and going over the company documents . ”
At the core of the investigation is whether the Gosselins ’ Wernersville , Penn. , home constitutes a formal TV set , where the children are being instructed and directed .
If so , it would bring the production under the state ’s child labor laws .
If not — if it ’s considered merely a domestic environment where they are being observed and filmed with little direct interaction with producers and crew – the state would have no grounds for violation , and the investigation will be closed .
The immediate consequences could be a fine — which , according to the state ’s laws , can range from $ 200 to $ 1,500 — or “ to undergo an imprisonment of not more than 10 days , or both , at the discretion of the court . ”
( For reality shows under fire , see accompanying story . )
TLC put out a statement on May 29 , when the investigation became public , stating that it and Jon & Kate Plus 8 “ fully complies with all applicable laws and regulations . ”
Attempts by TheWrap to contact Figure 8 Film and TLC were met with “ no comment . ”
This is not the first time that the regional authorities have taken a look at the realities children deal with on reality shows .
In 2007 , CBS ’ “ Kid Nation , ” where children ranging from 8 to 15 competed in the establishment of a non-adult - supervised society , was investigated by a number of departments in New Mexico for playing fast and loose with the rules and safety .
The Santa Fe County Sheriff ’s Office , in whose jurisdiction an on - set grease accident occurred , followed up on the victim ’s parent ’s claim that the program reflected an unsafe environment and disregard for labor laws .
The state of New Mexico itself threatened to get involved with the show for the hours that children were in front of the cameras .
Ultimately , the state dropped its efforts , citing not having received a formal complaint .
As for Jon and Kate , the show went on immediate broadcast hiatus after the couple ’s separation announcement and divorce filing .
It ’s not expected back on the air until Aug. 4 — if it reappears at all .
The couple did put on a united face on Independence Day for a family July 4th picnic at their home , seemingly unperturbed by their estrangement or the Pennsylvania Labor department ’s investigation .
“ No one can act like this is unknown , we have history here , ” Paul Peterson told TheWrap .
“ When Danny Bonaduce , who knows the ways of this biz , allowed cameras into his life , it destroyed his marriage .
It destroyed the Loud family back in the 1970s .
Now it ’s destroyed Jon and Kate ’s family . ”
“ If you these children get in trouble in 20 years you can be sure they ’ll be known as one of those kids from ‘ Jon & Kate Plus 8 , ’ ” cautions Peterson .
“ That will define them . ”

Rogers is scrapping the $ 6.95 system access fee and replacing it with a " regulatory recovery fee " that will differ by province .
The new fee , which takes effect on Oct. 5 , will range between $ 2.46 and $ 3.46 per month , depending on the region .
In addition , Rogers is raising the base rates of its plans by $ 5 and adding three free calling features — call forwarding , Who Called and Call Manager , which allow customers to manage incoming calls and alerts them to calls received when their phones were off .
The new structure is an effort to make customer bills clearer and bring pricing policies in line with what wireless carriers in the United States are doing , Rogers spokeswoman Liz Hamilton said .
The new charges do not apply to existing plans , although customers who want to switch to the new structure can do so if they are eligible , she said .
" If the plan you have works for you , that 's fine .
If you want to switch to the new plan , that 's fine too . "
The structure does also not apply to Fido , Rogers 's discount brand , which dropped its system access fee in November .
" They 're different value propositions and they have different marketing strategies behind them , " Hamilton said .
Follows other players ' leads
Telus was the first of Canada 's big three cellphone providers to ditch the system access fee when it launched its Koodo discount brand in March 2008 , with Bell and Rogers following suit with their respective Solo and Fido units ( Virgin , now a subsidiary of Bell , also does n't charge the fee ) .
Bell and Telus still charge the system access fee on their core brands .
Both companies declined to comment .
" At this point , we 're taking a look at it , however , we are n't able to comment on a competitor 's pricing approach , " said Bell spokesperson Julie Smithers .
" Of course you can count on Bell remaining competitive in the marketplace , but we have no new pricing initiatives to announce today . "
All of Canada 's existing cellphone network owners are facing an ongoing class - action lawsuit over the system access fee .
Lawyer Tony Merchant 's class action was certified in Saskatchewan in 2007 and is still before the courts .
Merchant has said cellphone providers have misled the public into believing the fee was a government or regulatory fee , and is seeking the return of up to $ 20 billion .
The carriers have denied that they misled customers .
None of the new cellphone companies that are launching service in the next few months —
Wind , Public Mobile , DAVE Wireless and Vidéotron — are expected to charge the system access fee .
Polls suggest that LDP leader Taro Aso is deeply unpopular Japan 's Prime Minister Taro Aso has apologised to legislators of his ruling party , after dissolving parliament to hold an early election for 30 August .
He apologised for a series of defeats his Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) has suffered in local elections , including in the key Tokyo municipality .
Opinion polls suggest the LDP could lose heavily to the opposition Democratic Party ( DPJ ) in the election .
A DPJ victory would end five decades of almost uninterrupted rule by the LDP .
'' Although we received lots of support from party members and supporters in a series of local elections , including the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly , we unfortunately failed to achieve our initial targets , '' Mr Aso told LDP legislators in a televised speech .
'' I apologize for that once again . ''
On Tuesday morning , his cabinet gave its formal backing to Mr Aso 's plan to dissolve parliament and hold a general election .
Japan is in a deep recession and correspondents say that at times the prime minister has appeared indecisive .
ASO'S KEY MOMENTS
Sept 2008 : Confirmed as PM Nov 2008 : Causes outrage by saying doctors lack common sense Nov 2008 : Alienates pensioners - a key constituency - by saying they " just eat and drink and make no effort " Feb 2009 : Economics minister says Japan facing worst economic crisis since WWII April 2009 : Introduces stimulus package after months of delay July 2009 : Tokyo election loss - fourth in recent weeks .
DPJ has at least 12 percentage point lead in opinion polls Profile : Taro Aso Japanese PM fights for survival
Last week , Mr Aso survived a no -confidence motion put forward by the opposition in the lower house .
But the upper house , which is dominated by the opposition , passed a similar motion .
Mr Aso 's position had already been weakened when the LDP lost control of Tokyo city council in elections on 12 July .
LDP rebels had sought to remove him before he could dissolve parliament , believing he was leading them to a historic defeat .
Polls published by the Asahi and Mainichi newspapers on Monday suggested that support for Mr Aso had continued to decline since previous surveys last month .
They showed him trailing Democratic Party leader Yukio Hatoyama .
Correspondents say the Democratic Party favours more independence from the US , a greater Japanese contribution to peacekeeping missions , and a smaller role for government .
Mr Aso is the fourth prime minister since the party won the last election to the lower house of parliament in 2005 .

Lifehacker reader Peter Frazier has the kind of home office and accompanying views that fill the daydreams of cubicle dwellers across the land .
His office is glass on three sides with a cantilevered deck that looks over the densely forested shores of Chuckanut Bay .
Peter describes his motivation for using the space as he does :
Like many in the computer industry , I graduated from college thin and fit , but since then , through years of all - nighters , sitting in front of my screen for long hours , and a rich diet I became overweight .
I went from 190 to 242 pounds as I grew into each role : graphic designer , user interface designer , customer experience researcher , businessperson , husband , father , and community member .
Last Fall
I said , " Enough already ! "
Recently I decided that working standing up would help me live a more active life .
It 's worked .
Along with meditating , running , hiking , and kayaking , working standing up ( with hourly interludes of pushups , situps or yoga ) I 've dropped 30 pounds .
My thinking is clearer for longer and you 're more likely to find me with things in perspective .
I 'm fortunate enough to work at home above Chuckanut Bay in Bellingham , Washington .
This stand up desk is a piece of cedar with its live edge intact .
On it I have room for a Dell 24 " monitor as well as my MacBook Pro , and my good old Monsoon sound system .

Sign your gear , add return incentives

Your wallet or purse already has your license in it for identification and mailing , but what about your other , possibly more expensive gear ?
You should definitely get a label on it .
Adam kinda - sorta thinks the ImHonest label service makes sense , if you want to protect your mailing address and give gadget finders an offer of a reward to return your gear ( even if that reward is , not surprisingly , just some ImHonest labels , unless you go further yourself ) .
Homemade labels with an email address might be good enough for most , but for gadgets with memory cards inside , digitally signing with a . txt file makes sense as well .

9 . Make your lunch look less appetizing

This falls under the same category of ugly - as - deterrent mentioned elsewhere on this list , but office lunch thieves are a different kind of bandit .
They ( somewhat ) know you , they ( hopefully ) do n't want to sell your goods , and they 're more of an opportunistic nuisance than a hit - and - run thief .
Since we originally posted about designer Sherwood Forlee 's faux - moldy anti-theft lunch bags , Forlee 's put his bags up for sale at $ 10 for 25 bags .
Not a bad price for semi-reusable bags , but you can likely replicate the effect on your own with non -toxic paint or food dye .
Better still , if you 're willing to sacrifice two slices of bread for the cause , we 've heard a surreptitious coffee grounds sandwich often teaches a vital lesson about personal property to refrigerator prowlers .

Targus bags and other carriers meant to look like a laptop , or have a generally high - tech appearance , do a great job of letting everyone know that something inside is expensive enough to buy a single - purpose bag for .
Getting clever with your gear holders is a good way to ensure you always know which bag is yours , and that laptop - hunting thieves are less likely to nick yours .
The newspaper sleeve is a good reference point , although it might get your laptop mistaken for a left - behind periodical .
You can also cobble together a clever carrier made from old plastic bags , cardboard , a FedEx envelope , or even an old wetsuit .

When researchers left 240 wallets scattered around the streets of Edinburgh , Scotland , they inserted an equal number of cute baby , puppy , family , and elderly pictures in them , along with a relevant mailing address .
They received 42 percent of the wallets back overall , but 88 percent of the wallets with cute babies in them came back .
The researchers suggest it has to do with an evolutionary instinct to preserve the young , so if it 's not terribly embarrassing , keep a cute baby in plain sight in your wallet or purse .
If you lack for your own adorable tyke , it 's a great reason to call that aunt you never speak to anymore .

Germany 's Secret Baader - Meinhof Files Prosecutors Revisit Notorious 1977 Assassination
The 1977 assassination of Siegfried Buback by the far - left Red Army Faction is one of Germany 's most famous unsolved murders .
Now new evidence suggests that former RAF member Verena Becker may have been involved .
But the intelligence services , who used Becker as an informant , are keeping the lid on a top - secret file which could clear up the crime .
Von SPIEGEL
Staff
I did OK in math .
Took a year of calculus in college .
Got a B and two A’s , if I recall correctly .
( It ’s all about getting a good professor . )
But math is not my favorite subject , and if you were to ask me to do a quadratic equation today , I ’d give you the lemon face .
This is my roundabout way of saying that some of the math Apple uses in Mac OS X has changed in Snow Leopard .
Particularly , the method Mac OS X uses to describe a file 's size .
It has to do with how you define a kilobyte , megabyte , and gigabyte .
Believe it or not , these words have had two meanings for a long time .
The first meaning relates to computer science .
Everything in computer science is about exponential counting .
Like this :
2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048
Do those numbers look familiar ?
There ’s a reason the iPhone comes in 16GB and 32 GB models , and the original Mac came with 128 K of RAM and the model after that had 512K .
Now think about this amount : 1024 MB of RAM .
That ’s what we could call 1GB .
Because to think in exponential terms , one gigabyte should be made up of 1024 megabytes .
But here ’s the catch — and the source of the second meaning for those terms .
Most non-computer types do n’t think in terms of 1024s .
They think in terms of nice , round numbers .
And 1000 is a nice , round number .
So you ’ve got two groups , each using the same word to mean different things mathematically .
Madness !
Which is why when you go to your Mac , select your hard - drive icon , and choose Get Info , you ’ll see that your “ 250 GB hard drive ” claims to have a capacity of 238GB .
Which is it ?
There are , believe it or not , now two sets of entirely different terms for these two ways of thinking .
For example , a gigabyte , or GB , is now defined as 1,000 bytes cubed , or 1,000,000,000 bytes .
A gibibyte , or GiB , is equal to 1024 bytes cubed , or 1,073,741,824 bytes .
( The same rules apply for megabyte and mebibyte , which are defined as 1000 bytes squared and 1,024 bytes squared , respectively . )
Wake up , you in back !
Because here ’s where Snow Leopard comes in .
In previous versions of Mac OS X , Apple used the 1024^3 definition of GB .
Rather than keep that math and start calling it GiB , Apple has started using the 1000^3 definition .
That 's why one of the QuickTime movies we use in our Speedmark tests , weighing in at 252,916,507 bytes , appeared as 241.2MB in Leopard but as 252.9MB in Snow Leopard .
The file has n’t gotten bigger .
It ’s the same number of bytes .
It ’s just a different kind of megabyte being used to measure it now .
( And in terms of us regular human beings who have n’t cracked a calculus book since the spring of 1993 , it makes more sense — a long number that starts in 252,916 should be 252.9 MB .
Dividing by nice , round numbers is easy !
For those of you who can divide by 1024 in your heads , my apologies .
You can still calculate things in mebibytes and gibibytes if you want .
But you wo n’t have the Get Info window to kick around anymore .
German AIDS Charity in Bed With Hitler , Stalin Shock and awe ad campaign depicts AIDS virus as mass murderer having sex .
Sept. 9 , 2009  --
A provocative television ad ready to air next week in Germany suggests that when you have unprotected sex , you could be in bed with the devil himself -- Adolph Hitler .
In a shock and awe campaign that promotes December 's World AIDS Day , Saddam Hussein and Josef Stalin are also leading men in a series of highly sexual videos that surfaced on YouTube this week .
The steamy ad opens in a darkened bedroom with a man and woman in bed , climaxing with a look - a- like of the German dictator 's face and tag - line , " AIDS is a mass murderer - Protect yourself ! "
The initiative came from the German charity , Regenbogen -- or " rainbow , " which defends the campaign on its Web site : " Up until now 28 million people have died .
And every day there are 5,000 new cases .
Which is why AIDS is one of the most effective mass murderers in history . "
European charities -- including the National AIDS Trust , which coordinates World AIDS Day in Britain -- have distanced themselves from the commercial , saying it further stigmatizes those who suffer from the disease .
But invoking fear by using a mass murderer as the face of a deadly disease is precisely what would make the ad successful , according to at least one public health specialist .
" It 's effective because it raises awareness of the risk factors -- absolutely , " said Dr. Amir A. Afkhami , instructor of psychiatry and behavior sciences and Global Health at George Washington University .
" This issue has come up among activists in the U.S. and there have been arguments that there needs to be more shock value , " he told ABCNews.com .
" The illness has become desensitized and the guards are down . "
" There is such a degree of complacency toward HIV / AIDS awareness – but I am afraid the German campaign wins the stage on this issue , " said Afkhami .
This controversy comes as the Kaiser Foundation finds that the number of Americans who list AIDS as the " most urgent health problem " is at its lowest level ever -- only 6 percent , compared with 44 percent in 1995 .
The April report coincides with one from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that found the number of Americans newly infected with HIV / AIDS is 40 percent higher than previously reported -- 56,300 .
Afkhami notes that the ad targets heterosexuals , particularly women , who , with African Americans , are one of the fastest growing groups afflicted with HIV / AIDS .
" There has been a lot of soul searching why this is occurring , " he said .
" The real failure on the part of health care advocates and social advertising has been raising awareness . "
Today , with more - effective drugs to treat those infected with HIV / AIDS living , the disease is largely viewed as a treatable , chronic disease .
" It 's less of the plague we saw in 1980s and 1990s , " he said .
" The grim reaper used to characterize AIDS . "
The German TV spot , created by the Hamburg - based advertising agency Das Comitee , is accompanied by a series of posters and videos that have been available online .
It also plans a radio ad using the voice of Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels .
Creative Director Hans Weishäupl told the British newspaper , the Telegraph , that it proposed the Hitler film after being told by the German charity to come up with hard - hitting ideas .
" A lot of people are not aware that AIDS is still murdering many people every day , " he said .
" They wanted a campaign which told young people that it is still a threat .
In Germany , Hitler is the ugliest face you can use to show evil . "
But other health professionals believe that the ad is insensitive and confuses the message .
" The woman has obviously seen his face and chosen to be with him , " said Jay Winsten , director of the Center for Health Communication at the Harvard School of Public Health .
" So it not only stigmatizes her , it blames her .
The important message about safe sex is completely lost . "
Fear Ads Don't Work , Say Some
Winsten argues that fear appeals " usually do n't work because people react by turning away and retreating into denial to escape the fear if it's too intense . "
" This particular ad will certainly garner publicity , but will not help the cause of AIDS prevention , " he told ABCNews.com .
" While I agree that the challenge is to break through young people 's complacency , I doubt that this ad will be taken seriously . "
But others argue shock tactics have been the bedrock of health advertising for decades with a proven track record .
Anti-smoking ads show cancer victims without voice boxes and charred lungs .
One notable anti-drug ad of the 1990s depicted the " your brain on drugs " as an egg frying .
Drunk driving campaigns have used shocking images .
And just this week a graphic ad that warns against driving while texting shows gory accident with bloodied teens .
" There is nothing new in the use of shock tactics in trying to elicit change , " said Afkhami .
A 2003 study of university students by Darren Dahl that was published in the Journal of Advertising Research found that shock tactics in AIDS ads significantly increase " attention and retention " of the message .
Other studies , including one from Ohio State University , show fear appeals to be " powerful persuasive devices . "
But Dr. Peter G. Shields , professor of medicine and oncology at Georgetown University Medical Center , said while the message is " clever , " it still offends .
" Hitler and his large supporting cast had made choices to kill , " he told ABCNews.com .
" The victims were innocent .
That is very different than people making their own choices and following risky behaviors . "
As for fear - based ads , " More times they have no effect and sometimes they produce an unintended adverse effect , " he said .
" In this particular case , the issue of AIDS is so well known that this advertisement wo n't bring new knowledge to the viewer . "
With more than 1 million in the U.S. living with the HIV / AIDS , most prevention programs focus on testing and disclosure .
About one quarter of those infected are unaware they have the disease , according to the CDC .
" It 's a very disturbing video , " said David S. Novak , a senior public health strategist for Online Buddies Inc , who runs Manhunt Cares , a sexual health resources service for the gay dating site , Manhunt .
He advocates non-judgmental " sex positive messaging " that communicates safe sex choices .
" It should encourage conversation about disclosure [ of HIV status ] , " said Novak .
" What is terrible is holding a secret and the secret disease inside of them . "
But one German native , living in New York City , said she was less concerned about the jarring image of Hitler , which , like the swastika , is highly regulated in her homeland , than the effectiveness of the message .
" I wish that if they are going to bring him out of the closet and dust him off for something , that it actually brings across an important message , " said writer Anne Gehris .
" This is not the right vehicle . "
" I find this more stupid than offensive , " she said .
" It just does n't work . "
Would you ever march up to a destitute African who is shivering with Aids and demand he " pay back " tens of thousands of pounds he did n't borrow – with interest ?
I only ask because this is in effect happening , here , in British and American courts , time after time .
Some of the richest people in the world are making profit margins of 500 per cent by shaking money out of the poorest people in the world – for debt they did not incur .
Here 's how it works .
In the mid-1990s , a Republican businessman called Paul Singer invented a new type of hedge fund , quickly dubbed a " vulture fund . "
They buy debts racked up years ago by the poorest countries on earth , almost always when they were run by kleptocratic dictators , before most of the current population was born .
They buy it for small sums – as little as 10 per cent of its paper value – from the original holder and then take the poor country to court in Britain or the US to demand 100 per cent of the debt is repaid immediately , plus interest built up over years , and court costs .
If they can't pay , the vulture fund goes after anybody who is paying the poor country money , trying to force them to give it to them instead .
In one instance , a fund tried to get a court order freezing Belgian aid payments to the Congo , saying it should go into their bank account .

Let 's look at an example .
In 1979 – the year I was born – the dictator of Zambia , Kenneth Kaunda , took out a loan for $ 15 m from the dictator of Romania to buy some tractors .
Most did n't work .
But after 20 years of non-repayment , the new democratically elected government of Zambia said it had no way to pay the loan , and negotiations began to cancel it .
But a multi-millionaire called Michael Francis Sheehan , whose company Donegal International is based in a British tax haven , had spotted a chance .
He bought the debt from Romania for $ 3 m , and took Zambia to court in Britain for the full amount – which had now piled up to $ 55 m .
The Zambian government explained that they do n't have the money .
A fifth of their people are HIV positive , and there are only 600 doctors covering more than 12 m people .
Most people are dead before their 38th birthday .
The Zambian President 's adviser , Martin Kalunga - Banda , explained – and aid groups verified – that if the government had to pay out for the dead dictator 's bills , " medicines that would have been available to in excess of 100,000 people in the country will not be available .... [ and ] in excess of 300,000 children will be prevented from going to school . "
The people who will go sick or uneducated were not alive when the loan was taken out .
The British judge who heard the case was clearly appalled , but he said the law gave him no choice but to require Zambia to pay $ 15 m , a third of what had been demanded .
Virtually all the debt relief the country had received that year – as a result of Jubilee 2000 and Make Poverty History – was wiped out .
What happens to the money once it is redirected ?
Sheehan – who likes to be known as " Goldfinger " – is fond of vintage Cadillacs , and lives in a mansion in Virginia .
Singer used the cash he took to become the biggest donor in New York to George W Bush 's 2000 Presidential campaign , and then went on to bankroll Rudy Giuliani 's bid in 2008 .
In the 1990s and Noughties , there was an extraordinary campaign by ordinary Westerners demanding that Africa 's debt be dropped .
It had a huge effect : $ 88 bn was cancelled .
Malawi – to name just one – went from having to pay $ 95 m a year to $ 5 m .
But these vulture funds are unpicking this progress with their long beaks , by grabbing the final threads of debt , and demanding they are all paid at once .
Vulture funds have been demanding $ 130 m from Liberia – a fifth of its entire GDP .
I have been to two of the countries most aggressively targeted by the vulture funds – Peru , and the Democratic Republic of Congo .
I spent a week in a gargantuan rubbish dump in Peru 35 miles north of Lima .
It is home to more than 5,000 children .
Among them I found Adelina , a little eight - year old smudge , living there in a nest she had built from trash .
She spends all day searching for something – anything – she can sell .
The vulture funds managed to get $ 58 m out of Peru , on a debt they paid $ 11 m for .
An hour 's drive from Kinshasa , the capital of Congo , I found an orphanage filled with emaciated children .
Since six million people have died in the war in Congo , these are the lucky ones : at least they have a roof .
The vulture funds demanded $ 100 m from this country .
When the government could n't – on a week 's notice – produce an inventory of everything they own for a US court , they began to rack up fines of $ 80,000 a week .
Most people , when they hear about this , ask – why is this lawful ?
Of course it 's important for countries to repay their debts when possible so they can continue to borrow for investment where necessary – but not if the debts were taken out by thieving dictators generations ago , and not at a loan - shark profit rate of 500 per cent .
As long ago as 2002 , Gordon Brown said these funds were " morally outrageous " , but only now are there tentative moves on both sides of the Atlantic against them .
In the US , the Democratic Representative Maxine Waters has introduced a draft bill called the Stop Vultures Act .
It would ban vulture funds from seeking " usurious " payments – defined as anything more than the purchase price of the debt plus six per cent a year interest .
In Britain , the Labour MP Sally Keeble introduced a 10 - Minute Rule Bill with similar proposals .
This pressed Brown to finally move .
He says the British government will give a " debt relief discount " of 90 per cent for any country in the Highly Indebted Poor Country ( HIPC ) programme .
This would kill the vulture fund business model .
It 's good – but it does n't go far enough .
They are lots of poor countries that do n't fall into the specific HIPC category , and they will still be carrion under these proposals .
The energy that drove Jubilee 2000 needs to be summoned again to pressure both governments hard .
Any measures in Britain will have to be introduced very soon because the Conservative Party is in practice defending the vulture funds .
Nick Dearden , the director of the Jubilee Debt Campaign : " At first , we had some Conservative MPs who supported us , but they were quickly silenced by Central Office .
They have been saying action against vulture funds is n't worth taking . "
Ah , the sweet scent of compassionate conservatism .
Is this who we want to be ?
Do we want to be a society that allows billionaires to sue the starving , the sick , and the stunted for pennies borrowed by somebody else , long ago ?
If not , we have to shut these funds – now .

Over the past few weeks I have been collecting information from human rights to shed light on one of David Cameron ’s allies in his new European grouping .
This is the first of a multi-part investigation .
Despite the persistent criticism that it has allied itself with extremists , David Cameron ’s Conservative Party now sits in the European Parliament with the European Reformists and Conservatives group ( ECR ) , led by Poland ’s Michal Kaminski – a man allegedly with a racist and homophobic past .
But so far it has gone unreported that another ally of the Conservatives in Europe has a much more serious and recent record of homophobia .
Valdemar Tomaševski , MEP from Lithuania , and member of the Tories ’ Euro coalition , is on record as having branded homosexuality a “ perversion ” .
Not only that , I can now reveal for the first time that he also personally voted for a Lithuanian law that has been described as a harsher , more wide - reaching version of Britain ’s Section 28 .
The Lithuanian law was widely condemned by human rights watchdogs .
The draconian “ Law on the Protection of Minors from the Detrimental Effects of Public Information ” bans discussion of homosexuality not only in schools but in any public places and media that could be accessed by young people .
Amnesty pointed out that if adopted , the proposals would also permit the prosecution of an extremely wide variety of activities , including campaigning on human rights issues relating to sexual orientation and gender identity , providing sexual health information to lesbian , gay , bisexual or transgender ( LGBT ) people or the organization of gay film festivals , or Pride events .
Tomaševski voted for the law on 16th June , shortly before vacating his seat in the Seimas , Lithuania ’s national parliament , to become a MEP ( see his voting record [ in Lithuanian ] here – Row 10 ) Update : here is an English translation .
Amnesty International has strongly condemned the Lithuanian hate law , saying it “ deprives young people of their right to freedom of expression and access to information and risks isolating children who are already amongst the most at risk of violence at school or within the family . ”
It ’s UK LGBT Campaigner Kim Manning - Cooper said :
This is a very bad day for LGBT rights in Lithuania .
By adopting this deeply homophobic legislation , the Lithuanian authorities have taken a huge step backwards .
This law is a clear infringement of freedom of expression and non-discrimination rights and should be repealed immediately .
A raft of other human rights groups and campaigners have also added their criticisms of Lithuania , among them Peter Tatchell , who said in June :
This legislation is homophobic discrimination .
As such , it clearly violates the European Convention on Human Rights and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights .
It also violates the equality and anti-discrimination clauses of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child .
Lithuania has signed up to these international humanitarian declarations but it is now defying them .
It wants the rights of EU and UN membership , but not the responsibilities .
A mere week after voting to pass the homophobic law , Tomaševski was welcomed with open arms into the Tories ’ ECR group .

( with many thanks to the kind people at the Lithuanian Gay League for responding to my request for information about Tomaševski’s voting record in the Lithuanian parliament )

The Alabama Freethought Association ( AFA ) does n't like the sound of " retreat " .
They call their convivial annual gathering at Lake Hypatia an " advance " .
The 2009 schedule promised an atheists vs agnostics softball game , a ceremony honouring atheists in foxholes , paddleboats , music , cartoons , and barbecue .
Lake Hypatia is named for the Alexandrian scientist and philosopher murdered by a Christian mob in 415 CE , who has become an unofficial secular martyr .
( There being no official secular martyr - selection procedure . )
It 's by Talladega National Forest .
The state considers it Lake Joan , but the AFA sign on County Road 303 says Lake Hypatia .
( " Joan ... of Arc ? " I asked .
" No , probably the developer 's sister . " )
Arriving on Friday , I found a registration table in the shade outside Southern Freethought Hall .
On one side a cheerful blonde was saying , " I was raised p'lyg . "
On the other a dark - haired woman marveled , " Until a year ago I never knew an atheist .
I thought they were all mean hateful people . "
The AFA is a chapter of the Freedom From Religion Foundation ( FFRF ) , based in liberal Madison , Wisconsin .
They 've been holding the Advance since 1991 .
It attracts 100 - 200 people , mostly from the South , many from communities where strong religious norms treat atheism as unthinkable and despicable .
At the advance , nonbelief provokes neither shock nor outrage .
The 2009 Advance included atheists who were once Black Hebrew , Catholic , Episcopal , Jehovah 's Witness , Methodist , Mormon , Pentecostal , Southern Baptist , or United Brethren church members .
Or pastors .
Attendees ' public expression of nonbelief ranges from Alice Cleveland , an energetic Alabaman who revels in fighting church - state trespasses ( " They ought not to have done that ! " ) to – I 'll call her " Name Changed " – a thoughtful woman who said , " I live in silence , like my mother did . "
Her husband said their first advance , last year , had been " the best weekend of our lives . "
It 's lovely there , with sweet - gum trees , tiny new frogs by the shore , and fireflies in the evenings .
As night falls , swallows swooping above the lake gradually give way to bats .
One afternoon a storm threatened .
AFA director Pat Cleveland explained which wall to stand against if a siren sounded .
I found Edwin Kagin , national legal director of American Atheists , studying the clouds .
" There 's your headline , " he said .
" ' God Strikes Atheists Dead in Alabama ! ' "
There was a talk on the evolution of flight in birds .
An Oklahoman ACLU director described having her house fire - bombed for suing over school - supported Bible study classes .
Songwriter ( and ex-preacher ) Dan Barker and Pulitzer - winning cartoonist ( and ex-Mormon ) Steve Benson presented a revue with Barker 's songs and Benson 's " Jesus Christ " drawings , the ones that make editors say , " Jesus Christ , we can't run that ! "
Everywhere people told stories .
In scheduled events and between them , over meals and on walks , matters discussed included fleeing a polygamist Mormon sect at 18 , trying to still religious doubts by starting one 's own church , how you explain beer in the camp refrigerator to Baptist landlords ( Yankees left it ) , winning arguments by quoting the Treaty of Tripoli , getting born - again to impress girls , and scripture - slamming on Chicago buses .
Although they substituted a " moment of bedlam " for a " moment of silence , " the advance was no bacchanal .
To a San Franciscan accustomed to the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence , their blasphemy seemed mild .
Their T - shirts with atheistic slogans were crisp , probably because they 're seldom worn outside the house .
As people who had gone through intellectual struggles in comparative isolation , what they really wanted to do was talk .
This crowd took great pleasure in reciting the first amendment ( " Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion ... " )
On Saturday afternoon Jeremy Hall , just out of the army ( and two tours in Iraq ) , talked about being harassed for his atheism .
He also described a nearly fatal encounter with shrapnel in Mosul , when he was at rear gun and the third truck in a convoy was blown up by an IED .
" Hey , Hall , close call you had there , " said an officer .
" Do you believe in Jesus now ? " " No sir , but I believe in ballistic glass . "
The freethinkers gave Hall a standing ovation .
They moved outside to gather at the monument to atheists in foxholes , which has the emblems of the branches of the US armed services engraved on the sides .
Fifteen veterans stood around the monument to be honoured by the assembled infidels .
The brief ceremony included a recitation of the pledge of allegiance without the inserted " under God " clause .
The group parted wistfully , planning to meet again at Occam 's coffeehouse in Memphis , the FFRF conference in Seattle , or next year at Lake Hypatia .

The secret CIA program to assassinate top Al Qaeda leaders was outsourced in 2004 to Blackwater USA , the private security contractor whose operations in Iraq prompted intense scrutiny , according to two former intelligence officials familiar with the events .
The North Carolina - based company was given operational responsibility for targeting suspected terrorist commanders and was awarded millions of dollars for training and weaponry , but the program was canceled before any missions were conducted , the two officials said .
The assassination program -- revealed to Congress in June by CIA Director Leon E. Panetta -- was initially launched in 2001 as a CIA - led effort .
But in 2004 , after briefly terminating the program , agency officials revived it under a different code name , using outside contractors , the officials said .
“ Outsourcing gave the agency more protection in case something went wrong , ” said a retired intelligence officer intimately familiar with the program .
Advertisement
The contract was awarded to Blackwater , now known as Xe Services LLC , in part because of its close ties to the CIA and because of its record for carrying out covert assignments overseas , officials said .
Blackwater ’s reputation was later tarnished after unrelated deadly shootings in Iraq .
Panetta briefed members of two congressional panels about the program in July , saying that he had only recently learned of the program and , upon doing so , had canceled it .
He also told lawmakers that he thought they had been inappropriately kept in the dark -- in part because former Vice President Dick Cheney had directed the CIA not to reveal the program to Congress .
The CIA declined to comment .
Efforts to reach Blackwater for comment were unsuccessful .
Blackwater ’s alleged involvement was first reported Wednesday night on the New York Times website .
The House Intelligence Committee has launched an investigation into whether the CIA broke the law by failing to notify Congress about the program for eight years .

 In my study of communist societies , I came to the conclusion that the purpose of communist propaganda was not to persuade or convince , not to inform , but to humiliate ; and therefore , the less it corresponded to reality the better .

There are two kinds of people in this world ; those who consider government to be a necessary evil , and those who consider government to be their personal Ponzi scheme .
I think liberals love Islam so much because they see so much of what they aspire to be in it .
Tyranny , authoritarianism , absolute power and control , the absolute , arrogant belief in their own superiority , the ability to deal brutally and ruthlessly with any opposition , anyone who dares stand against them .
Neither ideology should have any place in a free , sane , decent , civilized society .
The barbarians are n't only at the door , they are here among us , doing everything they can to replace us .
Anybody wearing a mask at a rally or riot is exhibiting malice aforethought and it should be legal to shoot them on sight .
Government is the greediest , most corrupt and murderous force on Earth .
It s not even debatable .
Government is a necessary evil , but because of its potential for evil its powers must be strictly limited by the rule of law , and must be subservient to the rights of the people from whom those powers derive .

TWENTY FIVE TOP QUOTES FROM THE DOJ'S REPORT ON THE MICHAEL BROWN SHOOTING http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/doj_report_on_shooting_of_michael_brown_1.pdf
( For official DOJ report , Google " DOJ Report on Shooting of Michael Brown PDF . " ) [ 01 ]
The evidence , when viewed as a whole , does not support the conclusion that Wilsons uses of deadly force were objectively unreasonable under the Supreme Courts definition .
( Page 5 ) [ 02 ] when the store clerk tried to stop Brown , Brown used his physical size to stand over him and forcefully shove him away .
( Page 6 ) [ 03 ]
Wilson was aware of the theft and had a description of the suspects as he encountered Brown and Witness 101 . ( Page 6 ) [ 04 ]
Autopsy results and bullet trajectory , skin from Browns palm on the outside of the SUV door as well as Browns DNA on the inside of the drivers door corroborate Wilsons account that during the struggle , Brown used his right hand to grab and attempt to control Wilsons gun .
( Page 6 ) [ 05 ] there is no credible evidence to disprove Wilsons account of what occurred inside the SUV .
( Page 7 ) [ 06 ] autopsy results confirm that Wilson did not shoot Brown in the back as he was running away because there were no entrance wounds to Browns back .
( Page 7 ) [ 07 ] witnesses who originally stated Brown had his hands up in surrender recanted their original accounts ( Page 8 ) [ 08 ] several witnesses stated that Brown appeared to pose a physical threat to Wilson as he moved toward Wilson . ( Page 8 ) [ 09 ]
The physical evidence also establishes that Brown moved forward toward Wilson after he turned around to face him .
The physical evidence is corroborated by multiple eyewitnesses .
( Page 10 ) [ 10 ] evidence does not establish that it was unreasonable for Wilson to perceive Brown as a threat while Brown was punching and grabbing him in the SUV and attempting to take his gun .
( Page 11 ) [ 11 ]
Wilsons account is corroborated by physical evidence and that his perception of a threat posed by Brown is corroborated by other eyewitnesses ( Page 12 ) [ 12 ]
Wilsons account was consistent with those results , and consistent with the accounts of other independent eyewitnesses , whose accounts were also consistent with the physical evidence .
Wilsons statements were consistent with each other in all material ways , and would not be subject to effective impeachment for inconsistencies or deviation from the physical evidence .

Therefore , in analyzing all of the evidence , federal prosecutors found Wilsons account to be credible .
( Page 16 ) [ 13 ]
Witness accounts suggesting that Brown was standing still with his hands raised in an unambiguous signal of surrender when Wilson shot Brown are inconsistent with the physical evidence , are otherwise not credible because of internal inconsistencies , or are not credible because of inconsistencies with other credible evidence .
( Page 78 ) [ 14 ]
Multiple credible witnesses corroborate virtually every material aspect of Wilsons account and are consistent with the physical evidence .
( Page 78 ) [ 15 ] several of these witnesses stated that they would have felt threatened by Brown and would have responded in the same way Wilson did .
( Page 82 ) [ 16 ] there are no witnesses who could testify credibly that Wilson shot Brown while Brown was clearly attempting to surrender .
( Page 83 ) [ 17 ]
There is no witness who has stated that Brown had his hands up in surrender whose statement is otherwise consistent with the physical evidence .
( Page 83 ) [ 18 ]
The media has widely reported that there is witness testimony that Brown said dont shoot as he held his hands above his head .
In fact , our investigation did not reveal any eyewitness who stated that Brown said  dont shoot . ( Page 83 ) [ 19 ]
Wilson did not know that Brown was not armed at the time he shot him , and had reason to suspect that he might be when Brown reached into the waistband of his pants as he advanced toward Wilson . ( Page 84 ) [ 20 ]
Wilson did not have time to determine whether Brown had a gun and was not required to risk being shot himself in order to make a more definitive assessment . [ 21 ]
In addition , even assuming that Wilson definitively knew that Brown was not armed , Wilson was aware that Brown had already assaulted him once and attempted to gain control of his gun .
( Page 85 ) [ 22 ]
Wilson has a strong argument that he was justified in firing his weapon at Brown as he continued to advance toward him and refuse commands to stop , and the law does not require Wilson to wait until Brown was close enough to physically assault Wilson . ( Page 85 ) [ 23 ] we must avoid substituting our personal notions of proper police procedure for the instantaneous decision of the officer at the scene .
We must never allow the theoretical , sanitized world of our imagination to replace the dangerous and complex world that policemen face every day . ( Page 85 ) [ 24 ]
 It may appear , in the calm aftermath , that an officer could have taken a different course , but we do not hold the police to such a demanding standard . ( citing Gardner v. Buerger , 82 F.3d 248 , 251 ( 8th Cir. 1996 ) ( same ) ) ) .
Rather , where , as here , an officer points his gun at a suspect to halt his advance , that suspect should be on notice that escalation of the situation would result in the use of the firearm . 
Estate of Morgan at 498 .
An officer is permitted to continue firing until the threat is neutralized .
See Plumhoff v. Rickard , 134 S.Ct. 2012 , 2022 ( 2014 ) (  Officers need not stop shooting until the threat has ended ) .
For all of the reasons stated , Wilsons conduct in shooting Brown as he advanced on Wilson , and until he fell to the ground , was not objectively unreasonable and thus not a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 242 . ( Page 85 ) [ 25 ]
Given that Wilsons account is corroborated by physical evidence and that his perception of a threat posed by Brown is corroborated by other eyewitnesses , to include aspects of the testimony of Witness 101 , there is no credible evidence that Wilson willfully shot Brown as he was attempting to surrender or was otherwise not posing a threat .

For the reasons set forth above , this matter lacks prosecutive merit and should be closed .

Col suo strapotere
Videocracy , valanga di applausi
" Niente da ridere , è un horror film "
Sullo schermo Mora il fascista e Corona l'anti-Robin Hood
E durante la proiezione ovazione per " Meno male che Silvio c'è " ...
dal nostro inviato CLAUDIA MORGOGLIONE
Un'ovazione finale per il regista , Erik Gandini , e due applausi a scena aperta : il primo nella sequenza in cui Berlusconi dichiara che il 50 % del suo tempo lo dedica a migliorare l'immagine internazionale dell ' Italia ; il secondo quando si vede il famoso video " meno male che Silvio c'è " .
E ' così che il pubblico , quello vero , della Mostra , accoglie la prima proiezione pubblica di " Videocracy " , con tanta gente che avrebbe voluto entrare e che rimane invece fuori dalla sala già piena .
Attenzione alle stelle , dunque , per il docufilm - appena sbarcato anche nei cinema - che ricostruisce gli ultimi trent ' anni di vita italiana , mostrando come l'impero televisivo del premier abbia plasmato , trasformato , forse devastato il nostro Paese .
E molto caldo , ricco di domande e di curiosità , è anche il dibattito che segue , tra gli spettatori e il regista italo - svedese .
" L'ho girato - spiega Gandini - perché volevo capire quest ' idea così potente , paurosa , che è alla base della tv commerciale made in Italy .
La logica surreale , cinica , che ne è alla base .
E anche perché in Svezia dell ' Italia e di Berlusconi si ride , e volevo dimostrare che non c'è nulla da ridire : e infatti , dopo che lì hanno visto una pellicola , l'hanno definita un horror " .
E per compiere questo viaggio nel Belpaese , l'autore sceglie come filo conduttore il racconto di tre personaggi principali : due vincenti , Lele Mora e Fabrizio Corona , e un perdente .
Un ragazzo di provincia chiamato Ricky , che spera di lasciare il mestiere di operaio per diventare una star del piccolo schermo .
Uno che non si capacita del perché i suoi provini , in cui si esibisce in un mix tra Ricky Martin e arti marziali , non siano finora andati a buon fine .
E che ammette candidamente di essere pronto a vendere sessualmente il suo corpo , per un film che lo lanciasse come " il Van Damme italiano " .
Ricky è presente anche alla proiezione e al dibattito di questa sera : " Guardando Videocracy mi è passata la voglia di diventare famoso " , dice alla platea , quasi per giustificarsi .
Ma lui è solo un piccolo ingranaggio di una catena , del corto circuito tra politica , potere , informazione , gossip , velinismo , bisogno spasmodico di apparire creato dalla tv commerciale ( e quindi berlusconiana ) .
Ben più inquietanti , in questo senso , appaiono Mora e Corona .
Personaggi che tutti conosciamo : ma che visti sullo schermo , nei loro habitat naturali , nella loro - diciamo così - normalità , fanno davvero impressione , Mora ad esempio mostra con tranquillità la suoneria fascita sul suo cellulare , al suono di " faccetta nera " e con immagini di croci celtiche e svastiche che si alternano sul display .
Ancora più forte l'impatto di Corona , che si autodefinisce " il Robin Hood moderno , che ruba ai ricchi e tiene tutto per sé " .
E che compare anche in una lunga e già celebre sequenza di nudo , sotto la doccia : " La scena è nata come idea sua - rivela Gandini - lui decide sempre come esporsi , come apparire " .
Malgrado il suo ruolo di protagonista del film , però , qui al Lido Corona preferisce eclissarsi .
E resta lontano dalla sala di proiezione , malgrado la sua presenza fosse stata in un primo tempo annunciata .
THOUGH it has n’t been true for years , many people believe that government employees receive lavish employment and retirement benefits in order to compensate for their meager paychecks .
The reality is that their paychecks are n’t meager at all : Government jobs often pay more than those in the private sector , and the difference between the two is growing .
Consider the lucrative lot of the men and women who work for Uncle Sam .
In 2008 , according to data from the Commerce Department ’s Bureau of Economic Analysis , the 1.9 million civilian employees of the federal government earned an average salary of $ 79,197 .
The average private employee , by contrast , earned just $ 49,935 .
The difference between them came to more than $ 29,000 - a differential that has more than doubled since 2000 .
Take account of total compensation - wages plus benefits - and the disparity is even more striking .
In 2008 , total federal civilian compensation averaged $ 119,982 - more than twice the $ 59,908 in wages and benefits earned by the average private - sector employee .
Chris Edwards , a scholar at the Cato Institute , has documented the steady widening of the gap :
In 1960 , federal workers averaged $ 1.24 for every $ 1 earned by a private employee .
By 1980 , the federal advantage was up to $ 1.51 ; in 2000 it was $ 1.66 .
Now it is $ 2 - and climbing .
When ranked alongside 72 industries that span the US economy , federal employees take home the seventh - highest average compensation .
Among the workers they outearn , Edwards shows , are those in such fields as computer systems design , chemical products , and legal services .
It is n’t only at the federal level that the political class so handsomely takes care of its own .
“ State and local government workers get paid an average of $ 25.30 an hour , which is 33 percent higher that the private sector ’s $ 19 , ’’ Forbes magazine reports .
“ Throw in pensions and other benefits and the gap widens to 42 percent . ’’
The Tax Foundation calculates that “ non-wage compensation ’ ’ for the average state and local government employee worked out to $ 12,362 in 2007 .
For the average employee in the private sector , the comparable figure was just $ 8,784 .
Americans increasingly fall into one of two camps .
Those who work for the government - about 15 percent of the labor force - tend to enjoy sumptuous perks , virtually indestructible job security , and pensions that are guaranteed for life .
The rest of us work in the private economy , where millions of jobs can be wiped out by a recession , defined - benefit pensions are disappearing , and competition and downsizing are facts of life .
There is a backlash coming , and it gets closer with each new revelation of public employees enriching themselves at taxpayer expense .
Employees like the double - dipping Florida college president who took a lump sum “ retirement ’ ’ benefit of $ 893,286 and receives a $ 14,631 / month pension , yet continues to collect an annual salary of $ 441,538 .
Or like the former Massachusetts lawmakers who qualified for tens of thousands of dollars in enhanced pensions - many while still in their 40s - merely by resigning from the Legislature .
Or like the Buffalo , N.Y. , police detective who is serving a 45 - year sentence for setting up drug raids in order to steal money and jewelry , but still receives an annual pension of more than $ 40,000 .
A full - page ad in The Wall Street Journal last week was the clearest evidence yet of the approaching showdown .
“ We are the Private Sector .
And we ’ve had enough , ’’ the ad proclaimed .
It announced the launch of The Free Enterprise Nation , which describes itself as the first national organization intended to represent the interests of the majority of Americans who work in the private economy .
Its message was blunt : “ The private sector provides pay and benefits for public - sector workers that we cannot afford to provide for ourselves . . .
We need to change public policy . ’’
The Free Enterprise Nation is headed by James MacDougald , a successful Florida businessman who has invested more than $ 1 million in the organization .
Already he has assembled a staff of 65 , including 10 researchers .
He foresees the day when the group will be as influential as the AFL - CIO , and when government officials never make a move without considering its impact on the private sector .
“ We ’re going to generate enough noise that government ca n’t ignore us , ’’ he told me yesterday .
“ We are n’t going away . ’’
Stay tuned .

UPDATED :
Republican Mitt Romney on Monday praised President Obama ’s decision to travel to Copenhagen this week to make the case that Chicago should host the 2016 Summer Olympics , saying the president ’s personal appeal is likely to ensure the city lands the games .
Until this week , Mr. Obama had indicated he would not be able to make the trip because he was tied down in negotiations over his health care proposal .
“ I think his presence makes it almost certain that Chicago will win the bid , ” said Mr. Romney , who oversaw the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics in 2002 .
“ I think we could have easily lost the bid ” had the president not gone to make the case for Chicago in person .
Mr. Romney , the former Massachusetts governor who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for president last year , said he believes that while Mr. Obama may be risking some political capital on the international stage by making the appeal in person , the move is in the country ’s best interest .
Mr. Obama could have faced a far more significant political backlash had he declined to make the trip and Chicago then lost out to one of the three other cities —
Tokyo , Madrid and Rio de Janeiro — in the competition for the 2016 games , Mr. Romney said .
Members of the International Olympic Committee are scheduled to announce their decision Friday .
Mr. Romney said that a personal appeal from the president conveys an important message to the board members as they are preparing to cast their secret ballots .
“ They recognize that if the president makes a personal appearance , there is an implicit assurance by the United States that these games will be successful , ” Mr. Romney said .
Officials who are overseeing Chicago ’s bid expressed relief and satisfaction Monday with the president ’s decision to break away from his efforts to win passage of health care legislation in order to make a personal pitch for the games .
“ Who better to share with members of the International Olympic Committee the commitment and enthusiasm Chicago has for the Olympic and Paralympic Movement than the President and First Lady , ” said Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley in a statement .
“ There is no greater expression of the support our bid enjoys , from the highest levels of government and throughout our country , than to have President Obama join us in Copenhagen for the pinnacle moment in our bid , ” Chicago 2016 Chairman and CEO Patrick G. Ryan said .
First lady Michelle Obama was scheduled to be the main U.S. representative to the IOC .
The president now will accompany Mrs. Obama , and the two will both participate in the American presentation on Friday before a final decision is announced .
For him , it will be a short trip .
He will depart Thursday evening and return to Washington on Friday afternoon .
In addition to the president , first lady and Mr. Daley , other senior governmental officials in the Chicago 2016 delegation include White House Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett , Secretary of Education Arne Duncan , Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood and Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn .
While in Denmark , Mr. Obama will meet with Queen Margrethe II and her consort , Prince Henrik , as well as Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen .

Abstract
AIPS is a system for graphically presenting information .
It promotes a high degree of interactivity between a user and a knowledge base or knowlege - based system , and is designed to be utmost domain independent and extensible .
This paper describes the concept of an Information Presentation System ( IPS ) , the intimate relationship between IPS goals and knowledge representation issues , and some of the architecture of AIPS .
I Information Presentation Interactive graphics is an indispensible technique for putting people in touch with a large knowledge base or knowledge - based system .
Graphic output is the best way to communicate a substantial amount of information to a human user because it exploits the high - bandwidth human visual channel .
Graphic input ( i.e. user input which points at or otherwise indicates components of a graphic display ) is an extremely economical way to describe something ; it is much easier to designate an existing depiction than to generate some other descriptor .
The descriptional economy of graphic input promotes a feeling of immediacy ; the user has the sense of interacting directly with information rather than dealinq with an intermediary .
For these reasons , interactive graphics can play an important role in larqe knowledge - based systems , whether at the interface to the end user or at the interface to the implementor or maintainer .
That role is not diminished by progress in natural
Facebook has confirmed to Wired.com that — like Twitter — it was the victim of a denial - of - service attack Thursday morning .
The service has been working just fine for me , but I contacted the Facebook press office to ask whether the rumors of an attack were true .
" Earlier this morning , Facebook encountered network issues related to an apparent distributed denial - of - service attack , that resulted in degraded service for some users , " responded Facebook spokeswoman Kathleen Loughlin via e-mail .
" No user data was at risk and we have restored full access to the site for most users , " she added . "
We ’re continuing to monitor the situation to ensure that users have the fast and reliable experience they ’ve come to expect from Facebook . "
If Facebook was attacked by the same party or parties who drove Twitter offline today , as seems likely , it means two things :
First , Facebook is more resilient to denial - of - service attacks than Twitter is ; and second , someone – or something – really wants both Facebook and Twitter offline today .

About a year ago John Stone , a senior research programmer at the University of Illinois , and his colleagues found a way to bypass the long waits for computer time at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications .
Stone 's team got " personal supercomputers , " compact machines with a stack of graphics processors that together pack quite a punch and can be used to run complex simulations .
" Now instead of taking a couple of days and waiting in a queue , we can do the calculations locally , " says Stone .
" We can do more and better science . "
Personal supercomputers are available in many flavors , both as clusters of CPU and graphics processing units ( GPUs ) .
But it is GPU computing that is gaining in popularity for its ability to offer researchers easy and quick access to raw computing power .
That 's opening up a new market for makers of GPUs , such as Nvidia and AMD , which have traditionally focused on high - end video cards for gamers and graphics pros .
True supercomputers , the rock stars of computing , are capable of millions of calculations per second .
But they can be extremely expensive – the fastest supercomputer of 2008 , IBM 's RoadRunner , costs $ 120 million – and access to them is limited .
That 's why smaller versions , no bigger than a typical desktop PC , are becoming a hit among researchers who want access to massive processing power along with the convenience of having a machine at their own desk .
" Personal supercomputers that can run off a 110 volt wall circuit allow for a significant amount of performance at a very reasonable price , " says John Fruehe , director of business development for serve and workstation at AMD .
Companies such as Nvidia and AMD make the graphics chips that personal supercomputer resellers assemble into personalized configurations for customers like Stone .
Demand for these personal supercomputers grew at an average of 20 percent every year between 2003 and 2008 , says research firm IDC .
Since Nvidia introduced its Tesla personal supercomputer less than a year ago , the company has sold more than 5,000 machines .
" Earlier when people talked about supercomputers , they meant giant Crays and IBMs , " says Jie Wu , research manager for technical computing at IDC .
" Now it is more about having smaller clusters . "
Today , most U.S. researchers at universities who need access to a supercomputer have to submit a proposal to the National Science Foundation , which funds a number of supercomputer centers .
If the proposal is approved , the researcher gets access to an account for a certain number of CPU hours at one of the major supercomputing centers at the universities of San Diego , Illinois or Pittsburgh , among others .
" Its like waiting in line at the post office to send a message , " says Stone .
" Now you would rather send a text message from your computer rather than wait in line at the post office to do it .
That way it is much more time efficient . "
Personal supercomputers may not be as powerful as the mighty mainframes , but they are still leagues above their desktop cousins .
For instance , a four - GPU Tesla personal supercomputer from Nvidia can offer 4 teraflops of parallel supercomputing performance with 960 cores and two Intel Xeon 5500 Series Nehalem processors .
That 's just a fraction of the IBM RoadRunner 's 1 petaflop speed , but it 's enough for most researchers to get the job done .
For researchers , this means the ability to run calculations faster than they can with a traditional desktop PC .
" Sometimes researchers have to wait for six to eight hours before they can have the results from their tests , " says Sumit Gupta , senior product manager at Nvidia .
" Now the wait time for some has come down to about 20 minutes . "
It also means that research projects that typically would have never get off the ground because they are deemed too costly and too resource and time intensive now get the green light .
" The cost of making a mistake is much lower and a lot less intimidating , " says Stone .
The shift away from large supercomputers to smaller versions has also made research more cost effective for organizations .
Stone , who works in a group that develops software used by scientists to simulate and visualize biomolecular structures , says his lab has 19 personal supercomputers shared by 30 researchers .
" If we had what we wanted , we would run everything locally because it is better , " says Stone .
" But the science we do is more powerful than what we can afford . "
The personal supercomputing idea has also gained momentum thanks to the emergence of programming languages designed especially for GPU - based machines .
Nvidia has been trying to educate programmers and build support for CUDA , the C language programming environment created specifically for parallel programming the company 's GPUs .
Meanwhile , AMD has declared its support for OpenCL ( open computing language ) this year .
OpenCL is an industry standard programming language .
Nvidia says it also works with developers to support OpenCL .
Stone says the rise of programming environments for high performance machines have certainly made them more popular .
And while portable powerhouses can do a lot , there is still place for the large mainframe supercomputers .
" There are still the big tasks for which we need access to the larger supercomputers , " says Stone .
" But it does n't have to be for every thing . "

I had a unique pleasure of working together with David Evans on helping a group of testers understand agile software development last week .
While talking about the value of quick feedback and short iterations , David used an analogy which I have n’t heard before and I liked it very much , so I decided to share it on this blog .
He started the story by going back in history to primitive societies and comparing hunters and gatherers .
Gatherers go around with a basket , looking at what ’s available and picking up fruit and veg .
When they encounter something new and unknown , they can take a bite and see if it tastes good , then put it in the basked it they like it or throw it away .
They pick up small things , one thing at a time , so if something is rotten or not edible , they quickly move on and find something that is fine .
Hunters chase a wild beast .
This is a bold and dangerous task so they have to carefully pick a relatively easy target and go after it .
Setting up a trap or chasing the animal takes a lot longer than gathering fruit and if the one they targeted gets away they need to do it all over again .
If for some reason they ca n’t eat the animal , the entire effort is wasted .
What ’s really important in the story is what happens at the end of the day if things do n’t go according to plan :
It ’s OK if you do n’t quite fill the the basket .
It ’s not OK if you do n’t quite catch the animal .
Short iterations and quick feedback make it much less risky to run software projects .
They allow us to do a piece of functionality at a time and see how we can handle that .
At the end of the project phase , if not everything is quite there but we have most of it , especially the high priority stuff , everything is fine .
Without quick feedback and short iterations , we ’re basically hunting the mammoth .
Everything depends on that final hit and there is very little room for mistakes .
I think that there is probably room for one more idea in this metaphor , where having the safety net of a half - full basket allows us to go and hunt a large animal every once in a while and put some meat on the table as well .

Note : “ Grilled ” & “ Bar - B - Que ” are often used interchangeably and the meats described as such are all usually prepared the same way , grilled , sauteed or pan fried .
If a menu offers both types of meats , then the “ Bar - B - Que ” selection is usually pork prepared in a style that is sweet & dark pinkish - red in color , similar to Chinese bar - b - que style .
If in question on the differences , ask the staff to further clarity their variations .
Good luck on that .
Another Note : “ Where ’s the meat ? ” -
The portions of the fillings usually satisfy the appetite of some Vietnamese ( especially the elders ) who do n’t require a lot of meat to satisfy .
But for the newer Việt generation and some American appetites , some sandwiches can be considered light on the filling ( although , there a a few places that really “ skimp ” ) .
If It leaves you unsatisfied & yearning for more , just ask for extra meat .
They ’ll be happy to assist you with that dilemma , but that ’ll probably cost you an extra 75 cents to $ 1.25 , ” please ! ” .
1. Chả or Chả Lụa ( Pork Roll ) – Ground up pork is packed tightly into a roll , and wrapped with banana leaves ( and or aluminum foil ) then steamed or boiled , hence producing the dense “ pork roll ” .
Sliced thin like bologna , these make up one of the most common cold cuts found in bánh mì .
2. Thịt Nguội ( Cured pork cold cuts ) –
Thịt Nguội ( translated as “ Cooled Meats ” ) , is the second most common cold cut filling .
Usually made of cured pork & layered with strips of fat .
Some makers will call it Ba Chị , which is more like pork belly .
3. Giò Thú ( Headcheese ) - These cuts are usually a Vietnamese combination of pork ears , tendons , skin , fats and other extra pork head meats .
It ’s all processed together into a roll , then sliced .
4. Dặc Biệt ( Special or Combination ) – Every menu has a Combination or House Special , which is a combination of at least one of the following : the pork roll , headcheese and / or cold cuts .
Some shops offer ham as an offering to the cold cuts , as well as adding their special house touch of other meats .
5 . Thịt Nướng ( Grilled Pork ) - Vietnamese marinated grilled pork .
Cuts of pork meat can be anything from pork belly , pork shoulder , pork chops or pork butt .
6. Xa Xíu ( Bar - B - Que Pork ) -
Sweet , pinkish colored pork cooked to the style of chinese bar - b-que .
Cuts of pork can also vary like those of grilled pork .
7. Xíu Mại ( Pork MeatBalls ) - Moist Pork Meatballs cooked in a usually , sweet , often lightly tomato based sauce .
Ground pork is marinated Việt style .
8. Bì ( Shredded Pork Skin ) - Most traditional
Bì is a creation of dry , thinly sliced pork skin .
To accommodate the more American palettes , some bánh mì creations come with traditional Bì along with more moist , shredded pork pieces .
9. Nem Nướng ( Grilled Pork patties ) –
These versatile , garlic , ground pork patties are popular in many fresh springroll and herb noodle salad dishes .
They make a very tasty in bánh mì .
10 . Nem Chua ( Sour Pork ) – Usually eaten as a snack with raw garlic , these little squares of sour pork meat are showing up on banh mi menu ’s more often .
Starting with mostly raw pork skin and some meat , a seasoning mixture of yeast , vinegar , garlic , fish sauce , salt , sugar & pepper are added .
The raw meat mixture is then wrapped ( usually in banana leaves or plastic ) into small squares are left to pickle and ferment for about 3 - 7 days .
The product is a small , dense square of sour , pickled pork meat with a garlic punch !
11 . Gà Nướng ( Grilled Chicken ) - Vietnamese marinated and grilled brown meat chicken .
12 . Thịt Bò Nướng ( Grilled / Bar - B - Que Beef ) - Vietnamese marinated style beef .
Grilled meat options are usually pork , but more places are offering beef as an filling .
13 . Cá Mòi ( Sardines ) -
Usually , the sardine selections ( bones included , but cooked ) are pulled straight from the can .
Nothing really homemade .
Once favored more by Vietnamese , sardine banh mi are now becoming more popular by non-Vietnamese because of the moist and flavorful fish texture .
14 . Paté – Ranging from chicken to duck liver ingredients , pates can normally be a part of every sandwich as a spread , but some menu ’s offer pate in larger quantities , making it the main savory filling ingredient .
15 . Trưng Chien ( Fried Egg ) -
Eggs are usually prepared as a scramble , well done sunny side up ( but cooked on both sides ) , omelet style or a little bit of all three .
16 . Chay ( Vegetarian ) -
Meatless choices can be offered in a combination of the ways :
A. Tofu Chunks – Chunks of tofu are deep fried , then sauteed with a vegetarian , Vietnamese marinade ( Soy Sauce , Veggie Oyster or Veggie Mushroom Sauces ) .
B. Shredded Tofu ( Bì Chay ) – Like the Bì ( Pork skin ) , this vegetarian version is made with thin slices of dry tofu , then mixed with stir fried sliced jicama , carrots and / or glass vermicelli noodles .
This type of filling usually is VERY dry , so ask for some extra soy for added moisture and flavor .
C. Veggie “ Ham ” -
These thinly sliced salmon colored ( or cream ) pieces of processed bean curd mimic the meat version quite well , but the flavors will dictate the differences .
Just try it , you just might like it .
D. Wheat gluten - Gluten pieces are prepared in the same way that tofu usually is .
Classic Condiment Fillings
1. Paté - Chicken or Duck Liver Paté .
2. Homemade Mayo- Sometimes made from an egg yolk & vegetable oil combination , or other shops will even have a store bought mayo or miracle whip .
Most shops will have some type of rich , white spread .
3 . Fresh herbs .
In the U.S. , we usually see fresh cilantro sprigs .
However other herbs were popular in different regions of Vietnam .
4. Pickled Carrots & Daikon – Usually finely shredded or julienned , these sour , vinegared accompaniments provide the salty , sour layer of flavor .
5. Jalapeño slices or other Chilies .
Warning for the lighthearted : Pepper spice potency level will vary heavily .
Nibble on a slice from your sandwich first before you bite
The jalapeño slice that tasted like a mild cucumber last week , just might pop back and kick you in the ass this time .
6. Cucumber Slices .
7. Light Sprinkle of Soy Sauce .

Section 1
For a couple of weeks I have been intending to produce a set of small competitive play guides , outlining the roles of the classes and the general strategies on the most popular maps .
Having just smoked the last of my weed , I can't think of a better time to begin .
The idea of this is that it provides everybody on the team a good basis for what they should and should n't be doing in matches , and in specific positions .
Everything in TF2 is fairly methodical , and a good eye for adapting tactics on the fly , as a group , is very important .
Really , TF2 competitive play can be taught , to a certain level .
The rest comes from experience and how your team decides to adapt its tactics .
Evidently , you wo n't be very good if you can't even aim a pistol , but experience and teamplay is more advantageous than raw aim alone .
That 's what I intend to do here - teach you how to play competitively .
**01 . Class Guidelines .**
TF2 is a game of attack / counterattack .
Everything that happens territorially throughout the maps is an example of this .
The problem is coordination .
When you have a meager 6 players over large maps , forming and attacking with small groups of players to take advantage of a narrow window of opportunity is vital .
This is where individual class 's roles come in .
Everybody must operate as part of a team , while being able to handle themselves individually .
Every class has to fulfill its individual niche while supporting the team as a whole , creating what is essentially a frontline using what classes you have to offer .
I would like you to read all of them , not just your classes , as I expect you to do with the tactics as well .
This is , after all , * Team * Fortress 2 , and if you do n't know what the rest of your team is doing , how are you ever going to adapt ?
Also , I will add a few team - specific things per-class so that you know what you can do to help whomever is playing it .
** Class specific guides **
** Medic **
As a medic , you are the backbone of your team .
Everything revolves around you and your ubercharge .
Players will be coming at you from all angles ; both friendly and hostile .
You need to be alert , and able to assess situations quickly ( a good way to do this is DM_Store healing , seriously ) , while providing good care to your team .
This means no ( * * NO ** ) toggle healing .
You simple cannot keep up with the demand for your uber with toggle .
At any time , up to 5 people will be calling for you , and you need to attend to every one .
This requires you to assess who requires healing the most while in and out of combat , and not neglecting certain players .
( PRO TIP - If a medic does n't heal you straight away , it does n't mean he does n't know you 're there .
Keep yourself safe - do n't run up to the medic screaming for heals if the medic is in combat , as the chance is you will get gibbed first .
Really , if the medic is healing one or two soldiers who are actively fighting with enemies , give him all the time he needs . )
Medics - you will be leading the push - not literally , always stick behind your soldiers at a safe distance , but you need to provide the soldiers as much health as you can give them while they are in combat - they * will * be taking more damage than any scout , or anyone out of front - line combat , so it is imperative to keep them as healed as possible .
However , when you are out of combat you need to heal everybody equally .
I cannot stress this enough .
An example - a medic has an overhealed soldier peeking at the enemy , throwing random spam .
He takes a little bit of spam but not enough to kill him .
He is n't in danger of dying .
A scout comes behind you with 25 % health , and you continue to heal the soldier .
The scout needs to return to his position , and neglecting him could mean the death of his partner , or himself , and eventually opening one route for the enemy to attack you .
As a medic , you will need to know everybodys names , common classes and importantly , how your heavy classes ( Soldiers , demoman ) like to play .
You need to know your players , as they need to know you .
Play with them on publics , using your main class , though if we plan to scrim every night , within a few weeks you will likely flatten everybody on a public .
You four players need to be a well - oiled team .
You need to respond to eachother well , both physically and vocally on ventrilo .
You need to know what your players intend to do , and they need to know how to respond to what you want them to do .
Which leads to the last point .
** You need to be the voice of the team **.
No other class , with the exception of soldier , can fulfill this role , and none can perform it as well .
As a medic , you will know where everybody on your team is inherently .
You will need to use this information to produce ever - shifting tactics and to coordinate what could potentially be a very unorganized team .
This means you need to vocalize every action you intend to take .
Constantly relay where you are ( but use common sense here , do n't block other important comms with locational reports if you do n't really need to ) , especially when nearing battle .
You need to meet up with a soldier or a demoman as fast as you can after respawning , as you cannot defend yourself effectively , and a boosted heavy - class is more than enough to fend off a few players .
From this point in , you are a team , and you need to communicate as such .
I can't really teach you how to do this , as it is different for everybody , but if you want to watch me in a few scrims , I 'll be more than happy to answer your questions and give you advice .
( this is getting really long , I wonder what the reddit wordlimit is )
** Soldier * *
Ah , the soldier .
As stubborn a class as possible .
The soldier is a mobile tank , a high - skilled HW guy , with the ability to soar like an eagle .
You are the teams damage dealers .
You are the teams frontline .
You are your medics lifeline , yet the bane of the enemy's .
Large pushes revolve around you .
As a pair , you are capable of dealing more damage in a short amount of time than any of the other classes .
This means that when a stalemate forms ( more on these later in the guide ! ) you have to root it out .
This section will not be as long as medic , as I do not have the experience to write as much .
I will teach you what I * know * as soldier , which comes from my medic experience .
Firstly , you are a pair .
You need to act much like the scouts - calling a target and attacking that , as a pair .
If you do not focus fire , your effectiveness will go to waste .
Like the scouts , except you are a frontline class .
Your goals are to either trigger their ubercharge if you both sport one or eliminate their medic , or whatever is easiest to attack .
If you can get a shot on the medic , if the medic * * is * * weak , by all means , attempt to get that last shot by rocket - jumping then proceeding to rocket or shotgun him from up high .
However , if the medic ** is not ** weak , do not chase him .
He will escape if he has any competance .
This brings you onto attacking your easiest target .
If a soldier is shooting you , chances are you can shoot him too .
You need to eliminate heavy classes , which are the main threat to your medic and yourself , before dealing with lighter classes .
Evidently , you do n't need to chase a demoman 100 meters away when there is a scout 10 meters away shooting you in the chest , but if the heavy class is actively seeking to kill you , you need to finish him before he does you .
( PRO TIP - The rocket - jump is your key tool .
If you are below someone , rocket - jump up to his height .
Height is key in the soldier class , as you may well know .
Firing down upon someone is far easier to do than firing back up , and as such if you can take the height advantage , do . )
This leads onto your relationship with the medic and your partner ( that sounded better in my head ) .
You need to assign yourselves as ' Primary ' and ' Secondary ' soldiers .
It DOES NOT matter which you choose , just that you have assigned them to you and your partner .
What it allows you to do is a very , very effective move .
In certain places , especially defending 2nd point on badlands , it is the most effective way to keep yourselves alive .
What you will do is , say you are defending while standing on balcony .
If 1 soldier jumps up to the spire , the Primary soldier needs to jump up , engage him until you are weak , then return to your medic .
All this needs to be opened with the word ' jumping ' or something similar , to notify that you are jumping up , and something along the lines of ' returning ' when you are coming back to the medic .
As you return , the Secondary soldier should take the same action - jump up , engage until you are weak , and return , while notifying via comms .
This is vital for good soldier play - alot of teams do n't do it but it makes ALL the difference in alot of situations ( which I will outline through map strategies ) .
The Primary and Secondary allocations apply to alot of other situations .
Like I said , they do not matter , but knowing how to use them is key .
As a soldier , you will be ubercharged alot , and knowing what do while you , or your teammate , are charged is vital .
Because of the way the medics ubercharge now works , the ubercharge depreciates faster based on how many targets the medic is switching between , as you well know .
This means that the uber is more effective if you use just one soldier for the charge .
What you need to do is push with one soldier , creating a temporary front - line just outside of the chokepoint you are pushing past , and have the other soldier use the ubercharge as a cover to peek and spam .
That 's all .
Most of their team will be occupied , at this point , by either an ubercharge or a demoman , or possibly scouts , so the secondary soldier will be fairly low - priority for their team .
It is a good time to spam their secondary soldier ( which may not be ubered as well ) , and take some shots at their medic as they come out of uber .
I will explain what to do if you are ubercharged later in the writings .
( If there is anything I have missed so far in this , do n't hesitate to message me on reddit or steam ( [ sc.lofty ] ( http://www.steamcommunity.com/id/lofty))
** Demoman **
Unfortunately , this is the class I know the least about how to play , but I can assist you with the tactics , or research any questions you may have ( I Lanned with the ( debateably ) best demoman in the world all of last year , and Dr Justice ( some of you may know him ) is my instagib teammate ) .
I 'll skip the bullshit here as this is getting pretty fucking long .
Your role as demoman varies wildly .
You are the 1 - size - fits - all class .
You can fulfill any role fairly effectively and provide what is essentially a skeleton - key of maneuvers to attempt to gain ground or out - wit a team .
You are fast ( over short distances ) , you can do alot of damage , and you are able to block off multiple routes .
You are a very effective ubered class , as not only do you free up both of the soldiers , but you are just as effective in their role .
Really , the demoman is the best class for clearing large distances .
If you need to push , but they 're 30 odd metres away from where they have you blockaded ( good example - granary last point ) , the demoman has the speed to clear the distance , but also , and crucially , can force them backwards with stickies .
You work like a mercenary for the medic and soldiers .
You come and assist them when they want you to , but you 're never really working for them .
You 're a lone wolf class .
You help everybody , while fulfilling your own goals .
Goals which are very similar to that of the scouts .
You are required , if there is n't a way for the soldiers and medic to push , to attempt to make one .
You can do this one of two ways - coordinate with the medic / solds for you to create a diversion , allowing them to push un - scathed , or working with the scouts to remove x player from the game , so that the medic can push .
At the same time , you need to work for the team by securing a chokepoint yourself .
Every class will have a choke - point to hold .
The soldiers / medic will hold one , the demoman will hold another and the scouts will hold a third , or assist the demoman .
You will be assigned one ( see the tactics ) in every situation , which allows you to do loosely attack them , hoping to get a lucky frag or working with the scouts to do this .
This means that you cannot just suicide .
The demoman is too important , as stickies are impossible to pass without an uber , and attempting to do so is stupid , so most wo n't attempt it .
If you intend to remove a player from existence during a stalemate , you can't just throw yourself at it .
If you attempt to enter solo , everybody will engage you .
You will produce a short distraction , but nothing more .
If the scouts enter , providing a fast - moving distraction , then you can enter unnoticed and unleash little balls of hell before anybody knows what is happening .
I will lay out your tactics more in the map - guides , as there are so many it 's not worth generalizing .
( Starting to wonder if this is worth it )
** Scout * *
Oh my oh my .
I sure have written alot .
Scout can be summed up in one word .
Annoying .
It 's their whiney New York accent , their obnoxious quotes and the motherfucking sandman ( though this is banned in leagues ) , but most importantly , it 's the playing style .
Scouts are great classes for demoralizing people .
And no , I do n't mean that in some weird , gamesense - slang way .
You can genuinely demoralize a team .
Ever seen it when a team gets rolled even though they had the superior players ?
Demoralization .
Because you are fast , quiet and have a double - jump , you can sneak around the maps behind the enemy and drop suprise attacks on them .
Imagine the feeling of a soldier to have been killed by that fucking asshole scout duo for the 3rd time running .
Morale is a very real thing ingame , both overall for their team and individually .
If someone gets angry or * annoyed * , they will most likely perform worse .
Some players will be steely - gazed robots who do n't get affected by this , but the majority will be hit hard by this .
As scout , you can make their players perform worse through near - humiliation , and as such make the job easier for you and your team .
The way in which you can do this is difficult , but you will need to learn how to to unlock the full capabilities of your class .
Because of the way TF2 plays out , alot of the time you will be matched up holding the chokepoint which the enemy 's scouts are also trying to defend .
As such , this making scout vs scout combat your most vital skill .
Improving this will improve your entire game .
Every other class should be secondary to improving your scout - killing skills .
And not just 1 v1 , but 2v2 especially .
You need to learn to attack the same target .
Unlike the soldier , you will be doing the same things , so you do n't need to assign yourselfs as Primary etc .
Much like the solider , however , you need to work as an effective team .
When you meet their scout - duo , which you undoubtedly will , you need to engage the ** closest * * scout as you see them .
90 % of the time , this will be a good guide provided you stick close together .
This allows you to effectively drop them .
Whoever gets that first kill is at a huge advantage .
You will get shot half as much , and most of the time , the pair who gets the first kill will not fail to get the second .
Doing this almost always , with the exception of a few positions , allows you to escape behind the enemy and attack them to provide a useful distraction for your team , or attempt to stealthily knock - off one of their players who may be respawning ( spawn - killing is totally fair - game provided you do n't waste time on it ) , or coordingating with your soldiers or demoman to produce a push .
You are the waste class .
Because of your speed and your low HP , you can be used to clear stickies , suicide or do all manner of things without impacting the integrity of the heavy classes too much .
Losing a scout is much less threatening , provided their scouts are n't going to push behind you , than losing a demoman , soldier or medic .
Scout is a very simple class to play , but every player crafts their own niches , their own routes throughout the map and their own playstyle .
Rarely will two scouts play exactly the same , or even similar .
Tweaking and refining the playstyle you will inevitably find is key for all classes , but especially the scout who is not restricted in maneuvers by tactics or a medic .
That 's it for this section ( holy fuck 3000 words ) .
Make sure you read each section once , then read it once more later on .
Read the whole sections please .
I spent over an hour writing this one section , and I do n't really want my time ( nor this team ) to go to waste .
Section 2
**02 . General Guidelines **
Having laid out the class - specific guidelines , my plan now is to list a few things which are important , yet apply to everybody .
If you do n't follow these , the team will fall apart and you wo n't get particularly far in any map , no matter how well you know the positions .
Again , I ask of you to read this section multiple times so as you can remember it , or draw from it during matches .
** Ubercharge **
This is competitive play .
The ubercharge makes everything tick ; who has it , who does n't and the medic 's life are key elements to pushes and retreats .
During play , the ubercharges will sway .
You will have the initial push , which on most maps will require the medic to build uber on the move ( no setup time on any of the CP maps ( except well ) ) .
When both teams hit the middle point , it is a battle for class domination .
The scouts attack their scouts .
The heavies attack their heavies .
The way it plays out is based on how many spam - kills you get , or have made against you .
Neither team can traverse the point , due to the sheer amount of spam around it , so distant spamming is key .
Once a single heavy class is lost , the tide turns due to the significant loss of spam .
Every class is key on the middle , and the medic needs to stay alive .
If both teams do n't lose their medics , then within about 40 seconds of the game starting , both medics will be close to , or ready to drop their uber in the hope of an advantageous kill .
Ubercharge is n't just the basic , however .
Kritzkrieg , when used properly , can be an extremely useful tool ( more in this soon ) .
As one team falls back and the other captures the middle , a stalemate will inevitably form ( unless you kill their medic on middle ) .
This is when defending your side of the stalemate is imperitive .
One soldier , preferably , will be charging up the medic .
Try to fire 1 rocket , reload .
1 more , reload .
This means that you will always have 3 rockets loaded incase the enemies try anything .
Again , readiness is key .
Once the charge is full , you have two options .
One , wait for them to push , and the other is to make a move yourselves .
If you get the ubercharge before them , that is a good chance to push ( this is also where fake medic calling comes into play - you can call that you are charged before you actually are , so you can mislead the team into not attacking you straight away ) .
Pushing is quite self explanatory .
You push at their team with all your firepower , hoping to get a few kills .
Everybody needs to be coordinated in pushing , so that they occupy their classes ( scouts need to engage scouts so that their scouts are n't an issue for heavy classes , etc ) .
When a push is called , everybody must follow that order .
It is imperitive to use all your might in a push , any less and they can use more ( if that makes sense ) .
Alternatively , if both teams have uber , what happens is not dissimilar , but a whole new game in its own .
Because of the way that uber degenerates , it becomes a game for the medic to keep as many people alive with as little healing as possible .
This means that you will get chances to take pot-shots at both of their soldiers as the medic switches to heal the one taking damage .
You do not want to stray away from their medic , as he is your ultimate goal - only spam what is in your range .
Because of the switching game , the medics uber will degenerate , meaning that the more damage you do , the faster his uber will drop .
This is key , because you can force him to use up his uber faster than yours , giving you hits on their medic before yours leaves uber , allowing you to eliminate a vital part of their team .
Because of this , pushing with 1 person is advised , and everybody should attempt to stay ** AWAY ** from an uber if you yourself are not ubered , as they will target you .
However , if the medic 's uber is close to dropping , feel free to swoop in and help remove him from the game .
Performing these maneuvers is all about timing and experience .
Experience as a team mainly , but the timing rarely chances .
Ubers are 10 seconds flat , usually averaging at around 6 or 7 seconds , so knowing roughly when to attack is key .
The soldier who is ubered needs to take advantage of this and attack their medic * as soon as* his uber drops .
The medic needs to die , to give your team the upper hand .
Again , though , use common sense .
If the medic has already ran away using his uber - charge as cover , do not chase him if there is a closer target .
The kritzkrieg works much in the same way as uber , but it needs to be used inconspicuously .
If they know you have it , it becomes ineffective .
The key to it is suprise , total and utter .
You need to run into their view just as you reach 100 % on the charge , so that you can hit it and fire a crit rocket before they even realize that you have it .
That is an ideal scenario .
The kritzkrieg works everywhere that the ubercharge does , provided you use it sparingly and effectively .
I 'll speak to any medics more about this , as it would take alot of space to explain here .
** Comms * *
Voicechat , ventrilo , and soforth .
Communication with your team .
This is the single most vital aspect for a team to grasp quickly and efficiently .
If you cannot communicate , your tactics and individual skill become useless .
It 's no good pushing with 1 medic and 1 soldier because noone else was paying attention .
Likewise it 's no good pushing solo as a demoman because you mis-heard or were n't paying attention .
You need to make your comms louder than your ingame sounds .
You need to be able to hear every single word crystal clearly , and every command needs to be followed .
Being medic , I will likely be calling for the intial scrims , and probably for much longer .
The one thing I ask of you is to follow my orders .
If I ask you to do it , do it .
Ok , if we 're stalemated and you have a better suggestion based on your own view , ask me .
If we are in combat , however , and this applies especially to heavy classes , you need to follow my commands .
There wo n't be very many , but they will be important .
Retreat is the single most important command I can give you .
If I tell you to get out of fire , or fall back to the next point , do so .
Do n't hezitate .
If you 're a soldier , rocket - jump backward ( if possible ) .
Do whatever you can to escape the scene as fast as possible , without endangering yourself too much ( else escaping becomes pointless ) .
I will usually call this early , very early , and as such if you do not comply , I wo n't take it lightly .
Not understanding is not an excuse .
Listen harder .
There are few things more annoying , or confusing , as wrong intel .
Everything you see class - wise should be reported .
I will list the names for every section of every map I explain tactics for , and learning these is key to calling .
Knowing your left + rights under pressure is important as well , and you would be suprised how many people mess this up ( repeat offender here ) .
If you 're going to call something , it 's better to wait a second for your head to process what you want to say before blurting it out and crowding voice comms .
Clear comms are essential so that every player can hear and be heard .
Do not shout on comms .
It usually comes out distorted , disorientating and generally annoying if you speak too loud or get too exited on comms .
Actually no , exitement is alright , but try to keep your voice at a normal speaking level .
Once people begin shouting , someone will shout over someone else .
We are not in competition with one another .
Do not chat on comms .
If it does not need to be said , type it , or say it at a round end .
No moment , other than while waiting for a new round to start , is appropriate for chatting .
It serves no purpose other than to fill comms , and the less there is the better .
Small quips and comments are fine in off - times , such as during a stalemate , but when someone is trying to coordinate keep chat to a nul , please .
** Movement as a team **
Another aspect of Team Fortress 2 is staying together as a team .
Telling someone to go from point A to B is fine , but when there are classes of varying speed , you need to coordinate your movement .
The easiest classes to coordinate are scout .
One scout needs to lead , and the other needs to follow him .
Who leads and who follows is entirely up to you , but whoever is following needs to be able to keep up and keep close , so that when you do find an enemy , you can both suprise them quickly .
Harder , however , is coordination between the medic and soldiers or demomen .
The medic runs faster than both of these classes , so keeping up is n't an issue .
The issue is knowing where to go .
The medic needs to act as a horse - rider , and the soldiers are his horse .
The horse does n't know where the rider wants to go , so the rider tells him .
The medic needs to command the soldiers , but the soldiers need to lead the way , so as not to put the medic in harm 's way .
It 's very simple to do , but it 's also very easy to ignore and mess up .
The medic needs to call where the soldiers should be heaving every time he is with them , and the soldiers need to comply .
One last thing in this section .
When you are dead , you are far from useless .
Scouts , if you are dead and your partner is not , coordinate for you to meet up once you respawn .
Likewise with soldiers and medics .
The soldiers need to meet with the medic ASAP so as to protect the medic and buff the soldiers .
The next section is going to be a strategy - runthrough of cp_badlands .
Section 3
**03 .
Map strategies **
What is a game without maps to play on ?
And what is a map without all the little niches that only playing for 500 hours reveals to someone ?
TF2 is full of these , and trying to explain them all here is not worth the effort .
You will learn them as you play , believe me .
Instead , I feel I can provide a good basis for tactics and positions around every map , allowing the people who have n't experienced competitive play before to have a foundation to build upon .
This is probably the most important segment out of the ones so far , although the others are also extremely important .
Strategies make up the entirity of TF2 and I believe that giving you a reference is the best way for you to quickly pick up the basics of the game .
Again , I ask you to read every single line of this , and preferably re-read it for maximum sinking - innage .
I 'll keep the intro brief , as these could take up quite alot of space .
Without furthur stalling , I bring you
** cp_badlands ** ( [ location names overview ] ( http://imgur.com/BtOKe.jpg) <- click this first !!)
The map .
The big one .
Everybody plays this map , wether you like it or not .
You will not avoid it .
It is everywhere .
However , it is also an extremely good map , and plays out so fluidly that you 'd think valve actually support the competitive communities .
The way I plan to structure these strategies is as follows - Middle Push , Defence ( CP1 - CP4 ) and Offence ( CP2 - CP5 ) .
I will throw in little class - specific tidbits here and there to keep you reading , and hopefully to teach you some things you did n't know before .
Ok , so both teams have readied up , and you just spawned .
Now what ?
Well , the first thing to focus on is making your way to middle as fast as possible .
On every map , every class will have a specific route to take to reach middle in the fastest time possible .
The scouts are pretty simple , but the soldiers and especially demoman need to learn their routes .
I wo n't outlay them here as it will eat alot of space , so ask me if you want to see ( I can probably find you some good demos ) .
As you spawn , the medic needs to heal the demoman , so do n't be bunny - hopping up and down .
This makes everyone 's life more difficult , and there is no reason for it , ultimately .
The demoman will proceed to sticky - jump away faster than the medic can run , and as such the medic will begin healing / overhealing the soldiers , ready for the middle point .
You will end up your house , and ready to get onto the middle point .
Here is where the speed becomes essential .
If you soldiers are too slow , you will not make it out of the door before the stickies land at it .
A good judge of your speed is how far along the medic is .
The medic should never , ever stop running at the start of badlands , so that he can avoid being stickied into the house , and the soldiers should be able to keep up with him quite easily .
As you push out into the middle point , you will be greeted with [** this view * *] ( http://imgur.com/BnA0m.jpg).
This shows roughly your positions within the map ( excluding demoman , who should be on the balcony ) after you are outside in the middle point .
The aim here is to spam them until they lose a heavy class .
Here , the soldiers really need to be focussing fire , preferably at a soldier on the floor .
You are aiming to get a single kill , so focussing one target is ideal .
Scouts , you need to be underneath the bridge , fending off their scouts .
Do not get yourself killed .
I cannot emphasize this enough ; if you die , their scouts have no opposition up to our medic .
All you need to do is hang quite far back in canyon , and fire at their scouts to ward them off .
However , you will be the first class to middle , along with your demoman , so a good idea is to meet their scouts on the point , and focus fire on one to attempt a kill .
Do not cross past the big metal circle on the point , however , as you will enter their soldier 's own - zone when they arrive .
Once both of you are weak , or you have successfully killed 1 or 2 scouts , head under the bridge .
If both scouts are down , you are free to harass their medic , or sneak into their house to attack the demoman .
[** Overview of scout 's middle - point tactic **] ( http://imgur.com/W7GAn.jpg)
Soldiers , you need to have one of you on the train - car , and one on the edge of the point with the medic .
Your goal is solely spam , then offence once you manage a single kill .
It is a simple thing to explain , but difficult to do in practice .
Again , I emphasize , focus fire .
Once you get your kill , one of you can quite easily rocket - jump up and toward them , while raining down hell .
This gives the other soldier + medic an opportunity to gain ground onto the point , starting the capture .
I do n't feel this needs a run-down specifically .
A few tips , however .
The soldier on the train - make sure you watch your left side .
Scouts can approach through the shit - house if you do not pay attention .
Demoman , your role is the most varied , as usual .
At the start , you need to be lighting fast , and aim to reach your house 's balcony .
From there you have access to a 50 % health - pack , and all the cover you need to spam spam away .
The first thing you need to do , ideally , is throw stickies to their side of the control point , aka where their scouts are .
This warns them off pretty effectively .
Once they have scarpered , begin firing stickies at the door to their house .
If their medic / soldiers are already outside by this point , sticky the front side of the point and begin throwing grenades at them .
This keeps them off the point , and hopefully keeps them spammed enough that they do n't get a minutes rest .
The grenades do n't even need to hit , just land nearby to cause confusion and pressure .
That 's the main bulk of the middle point strategy complete , now let 's say that you forced them to retreat , and both of you are charing ubers , both of you with 6 players alive .
You need to defend your point , by holding what is widely known as choke .
Choke is on every map , being the main route between the middle and second points .
On most maps , this is a very tight chokepoint requiring an ubercharge to pass .
You need to position yourselves something like [** this * *] ( http://imgur.com/ip35S.jpg).
The idea is to cover off every single entrance , while providing an even spread of firepower .
Scouts , you have a difficult job here .
You need to attack their scouts who will likely be at their resupply .
All you can do is attack them until they re-supply , and continue doing this .
[** Overview of your plan of attack here **] ( http://imgur.com/LVoxe.jpg).
You need to attack their scouts , force them into resupply , and as they go in , jump up onto their base 's balcony .
It 's difficult to pull off , timing - wise , but if their scouts decide to chase you onto balcony , all you need to do is camp the way you came in .
If they jump up after you , they will be crouched and very slow moving , and as such you can easily get a shot off into them before they do to you .
You can also attempt to evade them by using the complexity of their base to your advantage , then use your advantage of being behind them to coordinate a distraction with your team .
Just one example of the many possible outcomes .
Soldier , you need to spam the choke , while the other soldier charges the medic 's uber .
Be wary for pushes , so as I explained earlier , fire 1 rocket , reload .
This keeps 3 loaded at all times .
Demoman , you are tasked with holding the house .
You need to sticky [** these areas **] ( http://imgur.com/CDwmv.jpg), in order to keep them from entering the house and attacking your medic .
If they push against you with an uber , which is often the case , just run to the right toward your medic and keep your group together ready to either counter - uber or flee .
Pushing out of this position is much like any other push .
One soldier will go in with the medic , and force them to use their uber , at which point everybody holds away from the range of the ubered players .
Once their uber drops , every heavy class needs to descend upon the medic and his uber - target like hot shit and wipe them off the map .
The more efficient you become at doing this , the easier a time you will have attempting to push .
There are a few variable factors in this push .
If , for example , your scouts cannot beat their scouts at resup , your scouts can go through the door your demoman has stickied after the medic 's uber has dropped , and engage from there .
Be advised though , this gives their scouts alot of scope to back - cap .
The Demoman should spam from the door which I just mentioned , keeping yourself safe until you need to push on .
Alternatively , you can sticky - jump right up to the Spire and secure it for capture .
Again , assuming that they have lost 3 or 4 players and are retreating , you need to capture CP4 .
This is quite a simple maneuver , but easily messed up .
[** Movement overview * * ] ( http://imgur.com/EmG3U.jpg)
The medic needs to be defended , so assuming you have no scouts available to capture , one soldier and the demoman need to jump up to the point .
Demoman , the first thing you need to do is sticky the balcony or the front door , depending on their location .
Soldier , your job would be to keep anything from blocking your capture .
Pretty simple here really .
If a scout or two are available to capture , capitalize and use the time to move your heavy classes to the enemy base , preparing for your push to last point .
If you already have an uber , and know they do not , take a left at the front door and go directly through the lower section into CP5 , and attempt to capture .
If not , take a right and set up at the top of the stairs , charging your uber ready to push in .
[** Position Overview * * ] ( http://imgur.com/M8CUC.jpg)
The medic needs to stay on the back stairs , as it provides him cover if the enemy decides to push .
One soldier needs to stand half way down the stairs , watching the top - right doorway and the bottom door .
The other soldier needs to be watching the top - left doorway , while charging the medic .
The demoman needs to sticky up the right side .
Most will sticky right down at the bottom , on the entance to CP5 , but some will sticky further back , or even coat the floor with stickies .
Experiment , find what you like , but keep the right side on lock - down .
Scouts , you need to dart around , waiting for a push .
If one of you has died , and your team is preparing to push into last point , you could switch to sniper ( if you 're good , it 's not worthwhile if you can't hit for toffee ) , and snipe from a few positions - [ 1 ] ( http://imgur.com/PHUMo.jpg),[2](http://imgur.com/dcIzY.jpg),[3](http://imgur.com/G4bqx.jpg)
When you get your uber , it 's standard procedure .
The soldier + medic should push in through one of the top doors , either left or right , and b- line for their medic to kill him or force him to uber .
The soldier not ubered can come in just after the soldier / medic to provide firepower , and as usualy the scouts and demoman should hold back until the ubercharge has finished .
From here , scouts , you can do what you wish .
Choose an entrance , run through it , try to get some kills or cap .
Everything else on this point is experience , and can't be explained .
Demoman , you too .
If their demoman is dead , you can enter the right side door and spam from lower .
If he is n't , you can backpedal up to the top , and push in where the medic / soldier did .
This high position provides a very good spot for demoman to finish off the inevitable swarm of half to low health enemies left on the point .
If all goes well , congratulations !
You capped !
Now , let 's say that you are n't doing so well .
You 're on last point , and you need to get out and cap CP2 .
Well , if you 're on last point , you need to take [** these positions * *] ( http://imgur.com/1qx8C.jpg).
The soldier and medic on left need to charge the medic 's uber , and the soldier on the right needs to be watching the top window and the bottom door .
You can see when they push as the top is made of glass and the bottom is ...er... a door .
The demoman needs to watch the right side .
That 's his job .
Scouts can all too easily push in through there and cap the point when noone is looking , and that needs to be stopped .
If they push in , the demoman needs to move his stickies from the door to the point , so that you do n't permanently need someone standing on it .
This frees up the soldiers to attack from height .
Evidently , if the demoman dies , one or both of the soldiers need to drop down and protect the point from capture .
Scouts , here you are invaluable .
You need to find a route out right as their team pushes in ( take the opposite height to where they go - if they push high , run low , etc ) .
You need to escape and capture .
If all goes well , your team can defend long enough to buy you the time to capture CP2 , but it 's a very difficult thing to do , as the point captures so quickly .
Now , let 's pretend like that worked , and you have captured CP2 and moved up to balcony .
You need to take positions somewhere along [** these lines * *] ( http://imgur.com/1qx8C.jpg).
The soldiers and medic have pretty standard positions .
All 3 stay on the balcony , out of view ( snipers are used alot here ) and one soldier charges the medic .
The other one is tasked with watching the routes into the balcony .
The scouts hold resupply just as they would if they were holding chokepoint pushing to CP3 , by hanging just outside the doors and returning for health every few scuffs .
The demoman is the most versatile class here .
He can essentially free - roam because of the amount of cover offered by the balcony and spire , allowing him to get alot of damage off on the enemy team .
I do n't think I need to speak too much about this point , other than that the soldiers need to apply the strategy I told earlier ( jump up , attack , jump down ) , as it is only really held like this very very occasionally .
Now , you get a few kills from your demoman and you decide to push them back to their chokepoint .
You need to position yourselfs [** like so **] ( http://imgur.com/Rofu5.jpg).
The soldiers cover the choke , and charge the medic , while the demoman can watch the house and spam some grenades over .
The scouts will remain at the resupply , skirmishing their scouts , waiting for the time to push .
That 's all they can do at this point really - try to kill but not get killed .
When it comes time to push , this is just like any other .
Push with a heavy class , pop their uber , wait for them to run out , everyone else barges in .
You can utilize alot of tactics from the initial middle point rush on this section of the map , so it 's pretty simple to grasp how you should push forward on through this point .
That and my mind has died from the last 6 hours of making this crap Cheesy
I think the best thing I can do now is summarize how TF2 is played , now that you have seen a strategy for one of the maps .
It 's a pretty simple concept , even if the huge wall of text made it daunting as fuck .
[** Confrontation / Chokepoint overview **] ( http://imgur.com/VxrCn.jpg)
Basically , that map lays out every border which is contested throughout the playing of a single round of badlands .
You start off assaulting middle together , and you end up either falling back to 3 , 2 or worst case 1 , or pushing to 4 , 5 or 6 .
Every push you make is with the goal of breaking past these boundaries and pushing back the opposing team .
Once done , you re-form your team on the border and charge your uber , ready for the next push .
That 's it really .
It 's very simple .
Evidently there 's alot more to it than just that , but that 's the general idea .
Really , I can't type any more now .
If anyone has questions , something to add , whatever , add me - sc.lofty on steam .
I'm in the reddit team group , and the general reddit group .
The global financial crisis has brought the structural weakneses of the traditional newspaper business model into sharp relief for many world - renowned papers as the industry seeks to respond to the changing competitive environment in the digital era .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A rich debate is developing in print and across the web about the implications of these changes for the newspaper industry , for journalism , and for society .
And we would like you to help us explore and weigh this debate using the interactive map below .
We have seeded the map with arguments raised by , among others , Clay Shirky , Richard Posner , Jeff Jarvis , Roy Greenslade , Howard Kurtz , and our own Gavin O’Reilly ; however , as before , every aspect of the map is provisional and open to further iterative improvement like a wiki – with everyone being able add new points and comments to the map after registering and logging in .
The aim with interactive collaborative maps of this kind is to weave together all of the salient issues , positions and arguments dispersed through the community into a single rich , transparent structure – in which each idea and argument is expressed just once – so that it ’s possible to explore all perspectives quickly and gain a good sense of the scope and perceived merits of the different arguments
You can move around the map by clicking on the coloured spheres : clicking on the smallest spheres takes you deeper into an argument , clicking on the largest sphere takes you back up .
To rate the arguments , click on the arrows that connect the spheres .
A 1–9 rating scale opens when you click on an arrow .
A “ 9 ” rating means that you think it ’s a very strong point : a “ 1 ” rating that it ’s a very weak point .
As the community begins to rate the different ideas the thickness of the arrows changes to signal which ideas are perceived to be strongest and weakest .
The “ i ” button below the map opens a help page and the adjacent “ screen ” button expands the map to a full - screen view .
The other buttons let you view fuller details for each point , add comments and links to revelvant articles elsewhere on the web , access links to share and embed the map , and open an overview visualization ( which is also where you are able to add your own ideas to the structure of the map ) .
As with the other maps in the series you can you can keep up to date with developments on this map via the Independent Minds blog and @ The IndyDebate on Twitter .

Google Chrome Frame is the first realistic solution that addresses the problem of Internet Explorer 6.0 .
It allows businesses users to retain IE for legacy systems but provide enhanced features in new applications ( more about that later ) .
I ’ve been testing Chrome Frame for the past few days and I ’m impressed .
Chrome Frame Installation
Installing Chrome Frame is as easy as installing Flash , the PDF viewer , or any other IE plugin .
The full 10 MB application is downloaded and installed within a few minutes .
The process is quick , painless , and does not require a browser restart .
Chrome Frame is available for IE6 , IE7 and IE8 .
I ’m not convinced many IE8 users will need it ; speed and rendering problems are rarer in that browser .
However , the plugin will allow developers to use HTML5 , CSS3 , canvas and SVG features that would have been technically impossible before .
Under the Hood
Chrome Frame installs as a Browser Helper Object ; a Windows DLL that extends IE functionality .
BHOs are a standard method used to add toolbars and other plugins so Google is using Microsoft ’s own documented platform .
If Microsoft wanted to kill Chrome Frame , it would be technically difficult to achieve without affecting other plugins .
BHOs are also exploited by malware and virus developers .
Microsoft fixed this issue in XP SP2 by sandboxing BHO code and introducing the Add - on Manager which allows users to disable unscrupulous code .
Chrome Frame therefore requires IE6 on XP SP2 as a minimum .
IE Integration
Chrome Frame shares many of IE ’s browser features , such as bookmarks , history , cookies and passwords .
This is essential for end users ; it will retain their login credentials no matter which rendering engine is used .
Unfortunately , other plugins could cause confusion .
Although Flash may be installed in IE , you will also need to install the plugin within Chrome .
This may not be a huge problem ; Flash - heavy web sites are unlikely to benefit significantly by switching to Chrome .
However , I would suggest Google investigate the detection and automatic installation of popular plugins .
Speed and Stability
Confusingly , ComputerWorld are reporting that IE8 runs 10 times faster with Chrome Frame .
What they really mean is the Chrome Webkit engine is 10 times faster than IE ’s Trident engine when compared in the SunSpider JavaScript benchmark suite .
SunSpider is not a real - world test of page rendering speed and nor does Chrome Frame effect IE ’s default speed .
However , Chrome - rendered pages are noticeably faster and it allows you to run IE - incompatible code such as the excellent JSNES JavaScript NES emulator .
Chrome Frame is still in beta and there are issues .
For example , I experienced rendering problems in GMail , although it ’s fine in both IE6 and the Chrome browser .
Chrome Frame for Developers
IE will switch to Chrome Frame rendering if the following meta tag is added to the HTML head :
< meta http -equiv= " X - UA - Compatible " content = " chrome=1 " >
In addition , pages can be tested in Chrome Frame by adding “ cf : ” to the start of a fully - qualified URL , e.g .
cf : https://www.sitepoint.com/
The Webkit Developer Tools are included so it ’s possible to right - click a Chrome - rendered page and select “ Inspect Element ” .
It would be great if the same tool could be used in IE ’s view , but perhaps that ’s asking a little too much !
Accessibility , Progressive Enhancement and Chrome Sniffing
I ’m about to make a statement that will upset some developers .
Please sit down .
Ready ?
Sure ?
Here goes …
Chrome Frame does not allow you to drop IE6 support !
Many users will continue to use IE6 without Chrome Frame .
Many companies will block the plugin .
Users with IE - specific assistive technologies may not be able to use Chrome Frame .
So what ’s the point ?
Chrome Frame allows you to implement progressive enhancement techniques that support older browsers but improve the user experience in modern browsers .
For example , your application might produce a table of figures .
That table remains viewable in IE6 but Chrome Frame users would also see a colorful canvas - generated chart .
Chrome Frame adds “ chromeframe ” to the IE User Agent string when it ’s installed e.g .
Mozilla / 4.0 ( compatible ; MSIE 6.0 ; Windows NT 5.1 ; SV1 ; chromeframe )
You can therefore use server - side code to detect Chrome ’s presence , add the HTML meta tag , include enhancements , or display a link to the plugin download page .
Google also provide JavaScript Chrome Frame detection code .
Will Users Adopt Chrome Frame ?
Chrome Frame is still undergoing development and there are technical issues to iron out so I could not recommend it at this stage .
However , the future is promising .
Corporations and private users may be unable or unwilling to upgrade their browsers , but installing an unobtrusive plugin is significantly easier .

When Great Features Are n’t Enough : Twisted , Tornado , the Zero - Step , and Activation Energy
Fresh on the heels of Tornado ’s release , and Glyph ’s response to it ( note 1 ) and others , I ’ve been thinking about why Tornado so excites me .
Twisted is a robust , powerful , scalable asynchronous web framework ( among other things ) .
We have used it successfully in the past .
Taking them at their word , Tornado is scalable , but focused on http and much less fully featured than Twisted , it does provide authentication pieces ( awesome ! ) , and some other utilities .
In architectural terms , Glyph is probably right that Tornado is incomplete ( to be polite ) .
I still want to use Tornado .
I would much rather use “ best in class ” tools always , but sometimes the activation energy is just too high .
In using any piece of software there is a Zero - Step ( or 0 - step ) , where I have to be convinced to try it .
Tornado does an excellent job of convincing me .
Great Features Are n’t Enough
Look at the Dyson Airblade .
The narrative is simple .
Hands Go In Hands Get Dry Full Win
Now the Airblade is one of those rare items that actually delivers on its promise .
It ACTUALLY DRIES YOUR HANDS , unlike most hand dryers .
Capability is not enough .
If I ’d never seen one in action in person , I ’d have been slightly unhappy about my perennially soggy hands , but life goes one , and that ’s why the gods invented pants and skirts .
Now I pine for an Airblade whenever I ’m in some public bathroom without one .
The win does n’t come from how well it works , but from how moron - proof it is .
The Zero-Step Matters
Trivial applications should be trivial to write .
Of course , asynchronous web - serving is n’t trivial at all , but it should look trivial , because the dev should n’t have to care how it ’s implemented ( until they do , but not one second before ) .
I ’m not smart enough to write a good dict implementation either , but no one makes me go through hoops to use the excellent one that comes with Python .
you can do this too .
Low activation energy empowers the user .
Before a user can be a power user / evangelist , they have to start as a regular user .
For many people , Tornado will solve their problems well enough .
The “ hello , world ” in Tornado is a dozen lines , and looks very similar to the one in web.py , except that it inherits from an asynchronous class base instead of object or a PYPO ( a plain old Python Object ) .
This simple “ hello , world ” code is the featured content on the main page of their respective sites .
What is more inviting than that ?
It screams , .
Low activation energy empowers the user .
Before a user can be a power user / evangelist , they have to start as a regular user .
For many people , Tornado will solve their problems well enough .
If twisted can do this ( through some sane default web classes , decorators , etc. ( Note 2 ) ) , then point it out right on the front page .
Perception matters , and having a prominent snippet , saying “ YOU CAN WRITE IN TWISTED , and IT ’S SIMPLE , here ’s how ” , is more important than some of the posted news , for example ( Note 3 ) .
It may all be there , and build already , but it ’s not obvious to me , and not everyone has the patience to dig .
By contrast , when I learned Twisted , I felt like I needed to understand it holistically .
Nothing made sense , which was frustrating , then after a while , it all did , and I grokked in fullness .
Until then , it was blood and gore .
My goal was n’t to understand Twisted , it was to get an asynchronous app going .
That impedance mismatch affects uptake , mindshare , and adoption .
That ’s the 0 - step , and the 0 - Step matters .
Make The Easy Easy , and the Hard Possible
There is nothing new in this essay , except the weakly retouched photo of the Airblade .
Good usability is hard , and that ’s all we ’re talking about here .
Removing barriers to entry is part of it .
Do n’t make me choose between simple tools for simple projects , and complex tools for complex projects if I do n’t have to .
Create default modes / deployments that handle the usual cases
make “ first steps ” and “ hello worlds ” prominent on your project pages
most tools in the real world do n’t require a person to fully understand the tech before using it .
aim for a ‘ ramp - up ’ , where as one needs more functionality , one has to do more research , but not before
Twisted gets the “ hard ” end right .
Make the easy end easy !
Continue to “ make the easy easy , and the hard possible ” , and this world will iterate towards the best of all possible worlds ( Note 4 )
— — — — ——
note1 : Glyph , if you ’re reading this , I really do n’t mean to be a prick about this stuff , and I can understand why it might be very sensitive , given the amount of work you ’ve put into Twisted .
So please understand this as coming from a place of wanting Twisted to be more awesome .
I want to use Twisted , even in small projects .
I ’ll like it to be core of whatever framework I use .
Make it easy for me to do so !
Make it shiny .
Make it zero - barrier - to - entry .
note2 : SQLAlchemy is similarly complex ( from a “ scope of task ” ) standpoint to Twisted .
Maybe something like Declarative for Twisted would be a goodness .
I think I want an asynchronous - http mix - in basically :) .
note3 : More egregious example : the Clojure site , which seems to be much more focused on explaining how Clojure relates to other LISPs and Java than actually attracting outsiders .
I had a long discussion on SO about Clojure ’s presentation layer with one of its evangelists ( Rayne ) .
I ’m not sure who comes off worse .
He accuses me of needing to be spoonfed .
I prefer to think that laziness is a virtue .
And who does n’t want to be spoonfed !
note4 : FWIW , Dustin Sallings ’ ‘ Snake Tornado ’ looks like a great start / compromise , and exactly the kind of project I like to see .

Govt plans 6 b yuan bond float in HK
( China Daily )
Updated : 2009-09-09 08:10
The Ministry of Finance said it plans to offer 6 billion yuan of government bonds in Hong Kong for the first time to elevate the " international status " of its currency .
The sale on Sept 28 to individuals and institutions will encourage acceptance of the yuan for global trade and promote growth of Hong Kong 's fixed - income market , according to a statement from the ministry .
" The move will help expand yuan investment channels outside the mainland and promote cross - border yuan settlement , " said Shi Lei , analyst , Bank of China .
" It 's an important step in the long - term mission of making the yuan fully convertible . "
China is promoting greater use of the yuan overseas after Premier Wen Jiabao expressed concern in March that the US dollar would weaken , eroding the value of its $ 2.1 trillion in foreign - exchange reserves .
Brazil , Russia and India have also said the world is too reliant on the greenback .
The yuan is little changed this year against the dollar after rising 21 percent since a fixed rate was scrapped in July 2005 through to Dec 31 , 2008 .
The city 's residents have been seeking ways to profit from a stronger Chinese currency .
Hong Kong 's yuan deposits increased by 932 million yuan to 54.4 billion yuan in June , official figures show .
HSBC Holdings Plc and Bank of East Asia Ltd sold 6 billion yuan of bonds in Hong Kong this year .
HSBC Bank ( China )
Co said yesterday it received orders for 4.4 times the amount of debt it planned to sell , allowing it to raise 2 billion yuan .
The government bond sale will help " improve the international status of the yuan , promote development of the yuan bond market in Hong Kong , and help provide a pricing benchmark for mainland institutions ' bond sales in Hong Kong " , according to the statement from the Ministry of Finance , which did n't give the maturities of the securities .
The government may sell up to 100 billion yuan of government bonds in Hong Kong over several stages , the city 's Standard newspaper reported yesterday before the official announcement was made , citing people it did n't identify .
Hong Kong is seeking to become an offshore center for the yuan .
The issuance announced yesterday is " a new milestone " for developing yuan business in the city , said the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region .
Bloomberg News
( China Daily 09/09/2009 page13 )
BusinessWeek reports that Google CEO Eric Schmidt received no salary or stock compensation for his service on Apple 's Board of Directors , accepting only Apple gear and a " commemorative gift " in exchange for his services .
Schmidt recently resigned from Apple 's Board due to limitations on his effectiveness as the two companies have become competitors in an increasing number of areas .
Schmidt 's decision not to be paid for his Apple service differs from the compensation plan Apple put in place for directors in 1997 , around the time Steve Jobs returned as CEO .
Under the plan , Apple grants outside directors the option to acquire 30,000 Apple shares .
The options vest over three years .
For every year after that , directors are granted options to purchase an additional 10,000 shares , which vest immediately .
Additionally , Apple pays directors an annual fee of $ 50,000 , in quarterly increments of $ 12,500 .
Apple filings show that Schmidt , from the beginning of his service as a director in 2006 , declined both the retainer fee and the stock options .
Schmidt did reportedly receive Apple gear valued at $ 8,712 in fiscal 2008 as part of Apple 's program offering to Board members one of each new product introduced and discounts on additional merchandise .
Each director , including Schmidt , also received a " commemorative gift " in fiscal 2008 valued at $ 7,580 , as well as a cash payment to offset the tax liability of the gift .
Like Jobs at Apple , Schmidt accepts only a $ 1 per year salary for his CEO position at Google , and has also declined stock options for the past several years .
The new FeFoo search application is a Firefox extension which adds super hero functionality to your browser search box .
The fab thing is it works seamlessly .
Use it conventionally and it will return standard default results from your favourite search engine , say Google .
But if you need more just enter in a : ( colon ) followed by a code to get some very specialised search power at your fingertips .
I particularly like the ability to search my Gmail messages from the browser just by adding : em in front of the search term ( e.g. : em john ’s party ) .
And it ’s not just search either .
There ’s around 60 codes you can use with the tool , including ones to post a message direct to twitter , to translate a web page , download a video and much much more .
An instant keeper for me , and something I ’ll be using a lot !
When you add fefoo search it uses Google Search by default and you can search like you would normally search .
But the real magic begins when you use commands .
To differentiate a command from a normal search it begins with a : ( colon ) .
If you want to search for “ fefoo ” on “ bing ” use the command “ : bing fefoo ” and search .
If you want to search for “ fefoo ” on twitter use the command “ : twitter fefoo ” .
To see a complete list of commands use the command “ : help ” .
fefoo search is a simple search application made entirely in JavaScript .

Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library , originally developed at FriendFeed .
By using non-blocking network I/O , Tornado can scale to tens of thousands of open connections , making it ideal for long polling , WebSockets , and other applications that require a long - lived connection to each user .
Hello , world ¶
Here is a simple “ Hello , world ” example web app for Tornado : import tornado.ioloop import tornado.web class MainHandler ( tornado . web .
RequestHandler ) : def get ( self ) : self .
write ( " Hello , world " ) def make_app ( ) : return tornado .
web .
Application ([ ( r " / " , MainHandler ) , ] ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : app = make_app ( ) app . listen ( 8888 ) tornado .
ioloop .
IOLoop . current ( ) . start ()
This example does not use any of Tornado ’s asynchronous features ; for that see this simple chat room .
Threads and WSGI ¶ Tornado is different from most Python web frameworks .
It is not based on WSGI , and it is typically run with only one thread per process .
See the User ’s guide for more on Tornado ’s approach to asynchronous programming .
While some support of WSGI is available in the tornado. wsgi module , it is not a focus of development and most applications should be written to use Tornado ’s own interfaces ( such as tornado . web ) directly instead of using WSGI .
In general , Tornado code is not thread - safe .
The only method in Tornado that is safe to call from other threads is IOLoop.add_callback .
You can also use IOLoop.run_in_executor to asynchronously run a blocking function on another thread , but note that the function passed to run_in_executor should avoid referencing any Tornado objects .
run_in_executor is the recommended way to interact with blocking code .
asyncio Integration ¶ Tornado is integrated with the standard library asyncio module and shares the same event loop ( by default since Tornado 5.0 ) .
In general , libraries designed for use with asyncio can be mixed freely with Tornado .
A network of Russian malware writers and spammers paid hackers 43 cents for each Mac machine they infected with bogus video software , a sign that Macs have become attack targets , a security researcher said yesterday .
In a presentation last week at the Virus Bulletin 2009 security conference in Geneva , Switzerland , Sophos researcher Dmitry Samosseiko discussed his investigation of the Russian " Partnerka , " a tangled collection of Web affiliates who rake in hundreds of thousands of dollars from spam and malware , most of the former related to phony drug sites , and much of the latter targeting Windows users with fake security software , or " scareware . "
But Samosseiko also said he had uncovered affiliates , which he dubbed " codec - partnerka , " that aim for Macs .
" Mac users are not immune to the scareware threat , " said Samosseiko in the research paper he released at the conference to accompany his presentation .
" In fact , there are ' codec - partnerka ' dedicated to the sale and promotion of fake Mac software . "
One example , which has since gone offline , was Mac- codec.com , said Samosseiko .
" Just a few months ago it was offering [ 43 cents ] for each install and offered various promo materials in the form of Mac OS ' video players , ' " he said .
Another Sophos researcher argued that Samosseiko 's evidence shows Mac users , who often dismiss security as a problem only for people running Microsoft 's Windows , are increasingly at risk on the Web .
" The growing evidence of financially - motivated criminals looking at Apple Macs as well as Windows as a market for their activities , is not good news -- especially as so many Mac users currently have no anti-malware protection in place at all , " said Graham Cluley , a senior technology consultant at U.K - based Sophos , in a blog entry Thursday .
Mac threats may be rare , but they do pop up from time to time .
In June 2008 , for example , Mac security vendor Intego warned of an active Trojan horse that exploited a vulnerability in Apple 's Mac OS X. Last January , a different Trojan was found piggybacking on pirated copies of Apple 's iWork '09 application suite circulating on file - sharing sites .
Mac OS
X's security has been roundly criticized by vulnerability researchers , but even the most critical have acknowledged that the Mac 's low market share -- it accounted for just 5 % of all operating systems running machines that connected to the Internet last month -- is probably enough protection from cyber criminals for the moment .
Samosseiko's paper on Partnerka can be downloaded from Sophos ' site ( download PDF ) .

What is Cloud Computing ?
And Why Should You Care ?
Note :
This article is intended for a business audience .
For a technical explanation of cloud computing , see the sidebar below the business article .
To the non-technical among us , “ cloud computing ” may sound like something vague and amorphous .
After all , it ’s a cloud , right ?
So that means it ’s something that ’s insubstantial , floating in the sky .
If you imagine clouds as the Internet , then you can imagine cloud computing as using computers over the Internet .
That explains the origin of the phrase , but it does n’t tell you very much about what cloud computing is – or why you should care .
Another Step in the Evolution of Technology
The concept of cloud computing is simple .
It ’s another step in the evolution of technology .
When business first adopted technology for business processes , everything ran “ in- house ” on company - owned equipment .
Gradually , business realized that it ’s not very efficient to devote specialized IT resources and computers to basic business processes like accounting and payroll .
After all , it makes more sense for a company to spend its money creating value for its customers .
This is a perfect argument for outsourcing some of the technical aspects of basic business processes .
Step 1 : Outsourcing
Outsourcing is great for processes that are standardized and repetitious .
Payroll is the classic example .
But there are other day - to - day processes that require managers and employees to interact with data .
And classic outsourcing — sending the whole process out the door for someone else to do it — is n’t very conducive to significant employee interaction .
Companies are caught in the middle , with a desire to outsource a process , but also to allow employee interaction with the process .
What to do ?
Step 2 : Outsourced Hosting
Until recently , the only solution was to outsource the “ hosting ” of the process .
In hosting , the company hires an outside vendor to set up one or more computers , install the desired software , and then manage the “ back - office ” technical activities .
The company ’s employees use the software by connecting remotely to the hosted computers .
In the early days of hosting , employees would connect using a phone line and a modem .
Now companies connect to outside systems using the Internet , usually through an encrypted connection via Secure HTTP ( HTTPS ) for security .
Outsourced hosting has advantages , but companies still have to buy a fixed amount of computer capacity and run dedicated computers and software .
It ’s a lot like in - house computing except for the location of the equipment .
If the company needs more capacity , they must purchase it .
If the company needs less capacity due to a decrease in demand , it ’s not very economical to cut back , since the computers have already been purchased .
Step 3 : Software as a Service ( SaaS )
Enter “ Software as a Service ” ( SaaS ) .
SaaS lets companies share hosted computing resources with other companies , with each company ’s data secured separately .
It ’s as if each company is logging in to the same ( virtual ) computer but using a secure ID that keeps your data separate .
For example , each of Amazon.com ’s customers is able to see the orders they ’ve placed , but they ca n’t see the orders of other customers .
That ’s like SaaS .
A company using an SaaS vendor is n’t purchasing dedicated hosted computers .
The company is essentially sharing computer capacity with other SaaS customers .
The company gets nearly all of the security of owning computers , without buying a fixed amount of computer capacity .
It ’s like the way mobile phone service works .
Customers do n’t have to buy their own cell towers — they just share the towers that exist , taking advantage of the buying power of all of the other customers who share their resource .
Customers who make a lot of calls pay more .
Those who make fewer calls pay less .
Customers can sign up for different types of contracts based on their planned usage , and the price varies based on their contract and their usage .
There is a small compromise in security levels for companies using SaaS , since there is slightly more risk in sharing computers .
But a reputable SaaS provider builds a software wall between customers , and in practical terms a company ’s data is very , very safe .
Step 4 : Cloud Computing
How is cloud computing different from SaaS ?
The difference is in the back room where the computers reside .
Cloud computing distributes the computer capacity across multiple computers that may be in multiple locations .
It ’s like setting up your checking account with an overdraft option .
If you accidentally write a check for more money than you have in your checking account , the overdraft option will automatically move money from your savings account to make up the difference .
Similarly , cloud computing allows processes to run on one set of computers , but automatically “ farms out ” work to other computers when there ’s an unusually high need for computer resource .
This helps alleviate the response - time problems that come with peaks in demand .
In car terms it ’s like a turbo - charger — kicking in when you need it , but sitting quietly in the background when you do n’t .
Conclusion
Software as a Service ( SaaS ) allows a company to outsource a process but still interact with the outsourced systems .
SaaS provides a great deal of flexibility and variable pricing .
Cloud computing turbo- charges SaaS , giving a company the power of SaaS with the flexibility to support periodic peaks in demand .
Both SaaS and cloud computing allow access to data over the Internet , and both keep data secure .
Most importantly , both approaches allow you to pay for the results you need — not for the cost of the technology it requires .
Sidebar : A Technical Explanation of Cloud Computing
The definition of cloud computing is evolving , so do n’t expect to see a single definition that everyone agrees with .
In 2008 , Gartner defined cloud computing as :
“ a style of computing where massively scalable IT - enabled capabilities are delivered ‘ as a service ’ to external customers using Internet technologies ” [ Gartner G00156220 : Cloud Computing : Defining and Describing an Emerging Phenomenon ]
In the same research paper , they pointed to four key aspects of cloud computing :
“ Delivering services ( that is , as opposed to components ) … Included in this concept is payment based on usage , not on physical assets . ”
“ Massive scalability ” “ Delivery using Internet technologies ” Services “ provided to multiple external customers , leveraging shared resources to increase the economies of scale ”
NIST Definition
More recently the National Institute of Standards and Technology has developed a draft definition of cloud computing :
“ Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient , on - demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources ( e.g. , networks , servers , storage , applications , and services ) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction .
This cloud model promotes availability and is composed of five essential characteristics , three service models , and four deployment models . ”
Their five “ essential characteristics ” are :
“ On - demand self - service .
A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities , such as server time and network storage , as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service ’s provider . ”
“ Broad network access .
Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms ( e.g. , mobile phones , laptops , and PDAs ) . ”
“ Resource pooling .
The provider ’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model , with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand .
There is a sense of location independence in that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction ( e.g. , country , state , or datacenter ) .
Examples of resources include storage , processing , memory , network bandwidth , and virtual machines . ”
“ Rapid elasticity .
Capabilities can be rapidly and elastically provisioned , in some cases automatically , to quickly scale out and rapidly released to quickly scale in .
To the consumer , the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be purchased in any quantity at any time . ”
“ Measured Service .
Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service ( e.g. , storage , processing , bandwidth , and active user accounts ) .
Resource usage can be monitored , controlled , and reported providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service . ”
Their three “ service models ” are :
“ Cloud Software as a Service ( SaaS ) .
The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider ’s applications running on a cloud infrastructure .
The applications are accessible from various client devices through a thin client interface such as a web browser ( e.g. , web - based email ) .
The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network , servers , operating systems , storage , or even individual application capabilities , with the possible exception of limited user - specific application configuration settings . ”
“ Cloud Platform as a Service ( PaaS ) .
The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer - created or acquired applications created using programming languages and tools supported by the provider .
The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network , servers , operating systems , or storage , but has control over the deployed applications and possibly application hosting environment configurations . ”
“ Cloud Infrastructure as a Service ( IaaS ) .
The capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing , storage , networks , and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software , which can include operating systems and applications .
The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems , storage , deployed applications , and possibly limited control of select networking components ( e.g. , host firewalls ) . ”
Their four deployment models are :
“ Private cloud .
The cloud infrastructure is operated solely for an organization .
It may be managed by the organization or a third party and may exist on premise or off premise . ”
“ Community cloud .
The cloud infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific community that has shared concerns ( e.g. , mission , security requirements , policy , and compliance considerations ) .
It may be managed by the organizations or a third party and may exist on premise or off premise . ”
“ Public cloud .
The cloud infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group and is owned by an organization selling cloud services . ”
“ Hybrid cloud .
The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds ( private , community , or public ) that remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability ( e.g. , cloud bursting for load - balancing between clouds ) . ”
4 Common Threads between the Two Definitions
While the NIST definition is more specific , it does n’t contradict the Gartner definition — it just elaborates on it .
The common threads between the two definitions — and most other definitions I ’ve seen — are :
Use of Internet technologies , with most user interfaces being browser - based An incredible amount of flexibility and scalability Virtualization of large amounts of hardware and software so that the complexity of flexibility and scalability is hidden from the user , thus making the service very simple to use A payment model which hides the actual resources from the user so that pricing is based on the results achieved rather than the resources required
SaaS and More
As I indicated in the business article above , I view cloud computing as an evolutionary step in a progression of increasingly sophisticated technology .
Early outsourcing used colocation ( outsourced hosting ) .
Then security and control software evolved to the point where SaaS and multi-tenancy became practical — running multiple customers on the same software on the same computer at the same time .
Cloud computing goes one step further and virtualizes the computing resource used for SaaS , giving you the flexibility you need to cope with irregular demand and workload .
PaaS and IaaS
Although my business article focuses on cloud computing and SaaS — what I feel is the primary business use of cloud computing — the other two service models described by NIST will be extremely useful to IT organizations .
PaaS ( Platform as a Service ) and IaaS ( Infrastructure as a Service ) can be used as the next logical step in the virtualization of company hardware and software , and will ultimately offer us a way to get away from in - house infrastructure when we want to .
These two service models are less visible to a business user , but are just as important as SaaS to IT organizations .

Former First Daughter Jenna Bush
Hager is trying her hand as an NBC news correspondent , said Becca Milfeld in Politico , following “ in the tradition of Meghan McCain , Liz Cheney , and other daughters of prominent Republicans who ’ve waded into the media waters . ”
Hager will keep her part - time teaching job at a Baltimore charter school , contributing a story a month to NBC ’s “ Today ” show on topics such as education .
If we ’re so into " royal and aristocratic families , ” said Glenn Greenwald in Salon , we should just openly declare it .
Or we could have Jenna , Meghan , and Liz sit on a panel with Luke Russert and Jonah Golberg , moderated by Mike Wallace ’s son Chris Wallace , to “ bash affirmative action ” and praise our “ Great Meritocracy . ”
Seriously , with every media outlet “ firing and laying off real reporters , ” this is NBC ’s idea of a good hire ?
Give Jenna Bush Hager some credit , said Colby Hall in Mediaite .
She ’s “ already accomplished a fair amount ” for a 27 - year - old , having published two books , and she ’s certainly “ self - assured on camera , ” as “ Today ” executive producer Jim Bell noted in explaining why he asked her to join the show .
And she certainly knows something about being under scrutiny .
( watch Jenna Bush on “ Ellen ” )
Still , NBC and anyone named Bush ? said Shannon Bell in Right Pundits .
Talk about a “ curious tale of strange bedfellows . ”
Bell says the one topic
Hager wo n’t cover is politics , so she probably has some “ conservative tendencies ” — if she were “ a flaming liberal like Ron Reagan they ’d have her out touting Obama policies and such . ”

LAS VEGAS , Nevada ( CNN ) -- Christina Aguilar sits in a converted storage room of a Las Vegas medical center , the best hope for underinsured cancer patients to get the treatment they need .
Christina Aguilar , 28 , is being treated for advanced - stage ovarian cancer in Nevada .
Drip by drip , Aguilar , 28 , watches as chemo enters her body to fight advanced - stage ovarian cancer .
She is here because her insurance company would n't pay for her chemotherapy or her surgeries .
" I thought , ' Why am I getting insurance if it 's not going to pay for the most important thing ? ' " she says , recalling the day she learned her insurance would n't cover treatment .
Getting chemo in an old storage space is n't the most ideal situation , but it 's her only choice .
Watch chemo in a closet »
Earlier this year , state budget cuts in Nevada resulted in the slashing of the outpatient cancer center at the University Medical Center 's oncology clinic , forcing patients to find treatment on their own .
" We 're supposed to be the safety net for patients , and yet obviously the safety net has holes in it , " says Kathleen Silver , the CEO of University Medical Center .
Oncologist Nick Spirtos found a solution .
He persuaded his partners to take on the patients pro bono , converted a storage area in his office into a chemotherapy room and got Clark County to pay for the expensive chemo drugs .
One treatment can cost upwards of $ 10,000 .
He 's also sought more primitive ways to cover costs .
He holds up a clear plastic box bearing the label " Cash for Chemotherapy . "
Dollar bills and loose change jingle .
There are 380 boxes placed throughout the county .
" It helps , " says Spirtos , the director of the Women 's Cancer Center of Nevada .
" If these boxes pay for one more patient 's chemo , that 's one lady who in the overall context would n't be able to have her treatment . "
With the nation debating health care reform , Spirtos says he does favor universal health care , but not without trepidation .

He says Medicaid reimburses doctors at a fraction of their costs , and he believes other government programs are poorly run .
He wrote an open letter to President Obama and Congress earlier this month .
" [ I ] respectfully suggest that instead of rushing headlong into ill - thought out proposals , you and your staff along with Congress take some time and thoughtfully review the issues facing us and formulate a plan that might actually meet our needs , " Spirtos said .
But on this day , he 's focused on his patients .
Decked out in a blue doctor 's gown , Spirtos makes the rounds to see the women at his clinic .
Aguilar 's ovaries were recently removed and she is getting her latest chemo regimen .
She 's reclined in a chair , a red blanket draped over her legs .
She opens a laptop and flips through digital pictures of her mother , who died of lymphatic cancer 10 years ago .
Aguilar says her cancer was detected almost by accident .
She went in for a checkup and a small acorn - sized cyst was discovered .
A month later , it was the size of a grapefruit .
She broke down in tears just after her ovaries were removed .
" I started crying .
I was like , ' Oh my God , I 'm not going to be able to have kids , ' " she says .
Aguilar was a cashier at Toys R Us , making $ 8.76 an hour .
She had insurance through work , but it would n't cover her costs .
Her salary made her inelgible for Medicaid .
With the slashing of the county hospital 's oncology unit , her bills were racking up and she had few options .
Luckily , her doctor referred her to Spirtos .
Spirtos says cases like hers are becoming all too common , especially in the down economy .
He treats 75 to 85 women per month ; about 20 percent are in a similar situation as Aguilar .
" If you 're recently unemployed , you have no insurance benefits and you do n't qualify for any of the public aids , " he says .
" So amazingly , the people who 've been working and supporting the system , the moment they 're out of work they do n't fit in any of the round holes -- they 're square pegs . "
If Aguilar was n't getting treatment from him , he says , " Over time , her cancer would progress and she 'd pass away . "
The doctor , who is bald , stops at her side .
Aguilar rubs the doctor 's golden dome .
" The great part about this is Christina 's hair is going to grow back and mine won't , " he says .
The two laugh and smile .
Outside the room , the doctor says he 's doing all he can to make sure the women who come to him have the best treatment possible .
" I get to hug my patients , I get my head rubbed and I get an incredible amount of gratification , " he says .
He pauses .
" Getting a hug from one of these ladies is like my kids running up and saying , ' I love you . ' "
He turns and walks down the hall .
More patients await his help .

Such a system is downright evil .
But as the Anchorage Daily News reported this last July , the situation in the state 's Medicare - and Medicaid - funded in - home elder care program became so bad that the federal government had to step in and force Alaska to make necessary improvements .
In one 2 1 / 2 year stretch , 227 adults already getting services died while waiting for a nurse to reassess their needs .
Another 27 died waiting for their initial assessment , to see if they qualified for help .
The feds had been tipped off to the systemic problems by doctors and other health care providers , who found the state unresponsive when confronted with their incompetence .
No other state faced comparable problems .
UPDATE : Some have questioned whether the troubling two - and - a - half years during which the 254 neglected elderly people died coincided with Palin 's tenure as governor .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Goldman Sachs Group
Inc employees , on average , are within striking distance of $ 1 million of compensation and benefits this year , just months after the bank received bailout funds and other support from the government .
The figure will likely fuel criticism of the politically connected bank , especially at a time of recession and rising unemployment .
Goldman on Tuesday said money set aside for pay surged 75 percent in the second quarter .
Compensation and benefit costs were $ 6.65 billion , up 47 percent from the comparable quarter in 2008 .
Given a 16 percent reduction in staff from last year , to 29,400 , the bank set aside an average $ 226,156 per employee in the quarter , up from $ 129,200 a year ago .
If the quarterly figure is annualized , it comes to $ 904,624 per employee .
“ It is definitely a politically charged issue , but one of the objectives of Goldman paying back the government was that it would be free to adjust compensation , ” said Marshall Front , chairman of Front Barnett Associates .
Front said Goldman could pay some “ hefty bonuses ” this year but not as big as before the financial crisis , when senior managers pocketed tens of millions of dollars .
Gustavo Dolfino , president of New York - based headhunter WhiteRock Group , estimated compensation packages could top around $ 10 million or $ 11 million , and will be just for a handle of traders that structured deals that made money .
“ The biggest bonuses will go specifically to the foreign exchange and commodities traders , that are the people accountable for the kind of profits that Goldman is doing , ” Dolfino said .
“ People at investment banking will not make a lot of money , and people at middle market sales , and M&A will make a little bit more of money . ”
Goldman Sachs said the ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenue rose to 49 percent in the second quarter from 48 percent a year earlier .
The bank reported a 33 percent increase in second - quarter earnings .
Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said on a conference call with journalists that the compensation figures reflected Goldman Sachs ’ performance in the second quarter , adding that funds set aside for compensation could be lower in the second half if business deteriorates .
The compensation figures include cash salaries , estimated year - end bonuses , equity awards and other items such as payroll taxes , severance costs and employee benefits .
After Lehman Brothers collapsed in September and investors worried that other Wall Street banks were in danger of going under , Goldman Sachs converted from an investment bank to a bank holding company .
The move gave it permanent access to U.S. government funding , in exchange for stricter regulation , and was meant to restore market confidence .
Goldman received a $ 10 billion government bailout to strengthen its balance sheet .
It recently repaid those funds as the U.S. Treasury decided the bank was strong enough to survive without government support .
The bank also received access to a series of government programs designed to shore up the financial system , such as the ability to issue bonds backed by the government , and was a major beneficiary of the government ’s $ 180 billion rescue of insurance giant American International Group Inc .
To its credit , Goldman sidestepped the worst of a financial crisis that caught rivals off guard and generated massive credit losses and writedowns .
Netanyahu vs. Rahmbo ?
A few days ago , the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth published an article by Simon Schiffer reporting that several of Obama ’s advisors were “ demanding that Prime Minister Netanyahu dissociate himself from the venomous slurs that his aides have been disseminating against them . ”
Presumably the slurs in question refer to the story that Netanyahu and his aides referred to Rahm Emanuel and David Axelrod as “ self - hating Jews . ”
Quoting unnamed “ sources in the administration , ” Schiffer reports that the Obama aides responded to the Israelis by saying “ We do n’t need a certificate of approval from anyone on your side about our devotion to the State of Israel . ”
Obama ’s advisors were right to complain about these ugly calumnies , but is n’t there something odd about this whole controversy ?
Just plug the name of any other country into the sentence quoted above and see how strange it sounds .
Can you imagine a top U.S. advisor telling a foreign leader from Italy or Costa Rica or Canada or Belgium that they “ did n’t need a certificate of approval from anyone on your side about our devotion to [ insert country name here ] ? ”
Two features of this incident are particularly striking .
The first is the assumption by people in the Netanyahu government ( and apparently the PM himself ) that top U.S. officials should agree with the Israeli government ’s policies simply because they are Jewish .
If you do n’t agree with Bibi , it seems , then you must be a “ self - hating Jew . ”
( Of course , this is also the view of some hardline pundits here in the United States , who have made similar accusations about Jewish writers who are critical of some of Israel ’s current policies ) .
This statement is absurd , of course , given that plenty of Israelis do n’t agree with Netanyahu ’s policies , and there is a wide range of opinion among Jews all over the world about many aspects of foreign policy , including the Israel - Palestinian conflict .
Why Netanyahu expects blind fidelity from U.S. officials who happen to be Jewish is a bit of a mystery , unless he and his aides were just trying to guilt - trip Obama ’s aides into backing down on the current issues in dispute .
The second striking feature is the nature of the defense .
Assuming Schiffer quoted them accurately , U.S. officials are defending their position by stressing their devotion to a foreign country whose government happens to be mad at them , simply because the United States currently has a serious policy difference with that government .
But why did n’t Emanuel or Axelrod do what Henry Kissinger reportedly did when Golda Meir accused him of being insufficiently devoted to Israel ?
He reminded her that he was firstly an American , secondly secretary of state , and thirdly , Jewish , and he made it clear that this particular ordering of identities would guide his conduct .
Obama ’s aides might have responded as they did for domestic political reasons , or to try to win over sympathetic Israelis , but there ’s no reason to doubt the sincerity of their statement .
Emanuel , Axelrod , and other key figures in the administration clearly feel a strong personal attachment to Israel — and there ’s no reason why they should n’t .
At the same time , they disagree with Netanyahu about what policies are in America and Israel ’s long - term interest .
Given the amount of backing that the U.S. still provides to Israel , it ’s entirely appropriate for them to make those disagreements clear , and to try to convince Israel to alter its behavior .
This discussion is naturally tied to the delicate subject of what is sometimes termed “ dual loyalty , ” a topic that tends to provoke conspiracy theories from some and angry denunciations from others .
But given that the United States is a “ melting - pot ” society that has drawn its citizens from all over the world , and given the undeniable fact that Americans of various backgrounds feel strong attachments to a variety of foreign countries ( and for various reasons ) , it is also one of those subjects that we ought to be able to talk about in a calm and rational way .
An excellent place to start , by the way , would be Israeli political scientist Gabriel Sheffer ’s book Diaspora Politics :
At Home Abroad , which analyzes the issue in a clear and sensible fashion and avoids the hysteria that often infuses such discussions in the United States .

There are a variety of gall - forming species of small wasps that commonly infest oak , Quercus spp. , trees in Pennsylvania .
Most leaf galls on oak cause little or no harm to the health of a tree .
However , twig or branch galls may cause injury or even death to a heavily infested tree .
Two common species of twig gall - producing insects are the horned oak gall wasp , Callirhytis cornigera , and the gouty oak gall wasp , C. quercuspunctata .
These species are in the insect family Cynipidae .
Both the horned oak gall wasp and the gouty oak gall wasp are known to occur from southern Canada to Georgia .
Each of these galls may be diagnosed by their unique characteristic size , shape , and color .
Description
Figure 1 . A horned oak gall on a twig .
Galls are abnormal plant growth or swellings comprised of plant tissue .
Galls are usually found on foliage or twigs .
These unusual deformities are caused by plant growth - regulating chemicals or stimuli produced by an insect or other arthropod pest species .
The chemicals produced by these causal organisms interfere with normal plant cell growth .
The horned oak gall wasp , C. cornigera , attacks the twigs of pin , scrub , black , blackjack , and water oaks .
The gouty oak gall wasp , C. quercuspunctata , develops in the twigs of pin , scarlet , red , and black oaks .
Both of these woody twigs galls on oak look similar , but the horned oak gall has small horns that protrude from around the circumference of the gall ( Figs. 1 & 2 ) .
One adult gall wasp emerges from each of these horns .
Figure 2 . A gouty oak gall on a twig .
Life History
The life cycles of the various gall - forming wasps are highly variable .
Two or more years are required for gall wasps that develop in woody twig galls to reach maturity .
Gall - forming wasps usually overwinter as adults in protected places away from the host tree .
As the buds break in the spring and the leaves begin to expand , these small wasps start to lay their eggs in expanding plant tissue .
During the egg - laying process or early larval - feeding period , specialized body glands secrete growth - regulating chemicals that interact with certain plant chemicals to produce these abnormal growths .
After a brief period of cell growth , gall development stops completely .
The insect is confined within " its house " and feeds only on gall tissue during the remainder of its development .
Once these galls are formed , they do not continue to use nutrients from the host plant .
Damage
In general , most leaf galls on oak in Pennsylvania do not affect the health of the host tree .
A few can cause leaves to drop prematurely , or distort them so that photosynthesis ( the plant 's food - making process ) is interrupted .
Galls generally are aesthetically objectionable to homeowners who find them unattractive and fear that galls will cause damage to the health of their oak trees .
Management
Chemical control is seldom suggested for management of leaf galls on oak .
Cultural methods of control may be effective in reducing the impact of these insects .
Some fallen leaves may harbor various life stages of gall - producing pests .
Therefore , it may be useful to collect and destroy all infested leaves .
Some of these pests overwinter in twigs and branches of oak .
Where such woody galls are detected , prune and destroy the infested plant material when the galls are small and have just started to develop .
Once a gall begins to develop , it is almost impossible to stop or reverse its development .
Unless registered insecticides can be applied when gall wasps are flying , they offer little or no effective measure of control .
Lack of serious plant damage from leaf galls and the difficulty in proper timing of insecticide applications pose a strong argument against the use of insecticides to reduce galls on oak .
Warning
Pesticides are poisonous .
Read and follow directions and safety precautions on labels .
Handle carefully and store in original labeled containers out of the reach of children , pets , and livestock .
Dispose of empty containers right away , in a safe manner and place .
Do not contaminate forage , streams , or ponds .

Liverpool have agreed a fee , thought to be £ 20 million , with Roma for the transfer of Italy midfielder Alberto Aquilani .
Italy midfielder set to replace Real - bound Alonso
Liverpool have agreed a fee with Roma for the transfer of Italy midfielder Alberto Aquilani .
The price is thought to be in the region of £ 20 million with Aquilani now set for a medical before sealing a move that would see manager Rafa Benitez replace Xabi Alonso .
Benitez is poised to receive around £ 30 million from Real Madrid after Spain international Alonso passed a medical with the Primera Division giants on Wednesday .
" Alberto is a very good player and I 'm delighted we 've reached agreement with Roma for his transfer , " said Benitez on the club's .
" He will travel to Merseyside later this week for a medical .
Alberto has a winning mentality and great experience in both Serie A and the Champions League .
" He has long been recognised as a top class talent in Italy , captaining his country at both Under 19 and Under 21 levels before establishing himself in the senior national side . "
A statement from the club added : " Liverpool concluded their discussions with Roma once the sale of Xabi Alonso to Real Madrid was finally agreed . "
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
Authorities are looking for art thieves who made off with a collection of Andy Warhol paintings from a private residence last week , police in Los Angeles , California , said Friday .
Three of the Andy Warhol works stolen from a private collection : Chris Evert , Muhammad Ali and Pele .
The stolen pieces included large pop-art portraits of several famous athletes , including tennis pro Chris Evert , basketball great Kareem Abdul - Jabbar , soccer legend Pelé and Major League Baseball pitcher Tom Seaver , police said .
The multimillion - dollar collection had been displayed in the dining room of Richard Weisman , a Los Angeles businessman whose portait is among the missing items , police said .
The theft was discovered by one of Weisman 's employees and occurred between September 2 and 3 , police said .
A $ 1 million reward has been offered for information leading to the recovery of the art .
All About Crime
In a few weeks , tens of thousands of creative people will make their yearly pilgrimage to Nevada ’s Black Rock desert for Burning Man , an annual art event and temporary community celebrating radical self expression , self - reliance , creativity and freedom .
Most have the entirely reasonable expectation that they will own and control what is likely the largest number of creative works generated on the Playa : the photos they take to document their creations and experiences .
That ’s because they have n’t read the Burning Man Terms and Conditions .
Those Terms and Conditions include a remarkable bit of legal sleight - of - hand : as soon as “ any third party displays or disseminates ” your photos or videos in a manner that the Burning Man Organization ( BMO ) does n’t like , those photos or videos become the property of the BMO .
This “ we automatically own all your stuff ” magic appears to be creative lawyering intended to allow the BMO to use the streamlined “ notice and takedown ” process enshrined in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) to quickly remove photos from the Internet .
The BMO also limits your own rights to use your own photos and videos on any public websites , ( 1 ) obliging you to take down any photos to which BMO objects , for any reason ; and ( 2 ) forbidding you from allowing anyone else to reuse your photos ( i.e. , no licensing your work no matter what is depicted , including Creative Commons licensing , and no option to donate your work to the public domain ) .
Moreover , the Burning Man Terms and Conditions also strip attendees of their trademark fair use rights .
The ticket terms forbid any use of Burning Man trademarks on any website , which means that ticket - holders can’t label their photos “ Burning Man 2009 ” or even use the words “ Burning Man ” on their Facebook walls or Twitter updates .
We do empathize with BMO ’s desire to preserve the festival ’s noncommercial character and to protect the privacy interests of ticket - holders .
But by granting itself ownership of your creative works and forbidding fair uses of its trademarks , BMO is using the “ fine print ” to give itself the power of fast and easy online censorship .
BMO 's not the first to misuse the DMCA this way .
Some doctors recently have begun to use the DMCA process to take down negative comments patients post about them to websites like RateMDs.com .
How can they do this ?
Under the same theory BMO is using , each doctor demands that patients assign to the doctor copyright in anything the patient writes online about the doctor .
It ’s bad enough that some companies routinely trot out contracts prohibiting you from criticizing them , but it ’s another thing altogether when they demand that you hand over your copyrights to any criticisms , so that they can use the DMCA to censor your own expression off the Internet .
The BMO ’s motives here may be more laudable than those of the paranoid doctors .
But the collateral damage to our free speech is unacceptable .
Using take - it - or - leave - it fine print to assert veto rights over online expression is no way to promote a “ society that connects each individual to his or her creative powers . ”
Burning Man strives to celebrate our individuality , creativity and free spirit .
Unfortunately , the fine print on the tickets does n’t live up to that aspiration .
Update : Burning Man has responded to our post , arguing that the terms are necessary to protect Black Rock City culture , prompting a lively debate in the comments section and at BoingBoing .
" Can you integrate this with my e-mail ? "
It 's one of the more dreaded questions in software development .
For any programmer who has been around the block a few times , it evokes a long repressed fear of Sendmail m4 macros or Outlook COM objects .
When a non-technical managerial type asks this question in a group meeting , and your boss assures him that Internal System from Hell X can easily be integrated with the company 's e-mail system , your palms sweat .
As a development platform , e-mail has gone neglected for decades .
Its esoteric implementation details and specifications are regarded by many in the IT business as voodoo , best left to old - granddad programs like Sendmail or Postfix .
Zed Shaw hopes to change that with his new project , Lamson .
( The name Lamson is a throwback to the early 20th century pneumatic tubes used to shuttle messages between offices .
It was originally called Son of Sam , but Zed 's dog convinced him to change it ) .
Developers in the Ruby on Rails community will remember Zed as the author of the Mongrel server , which gained popularity for being the first Rails production server for grown - ups .
Zed started the Lamson project after struggling to set up an e-mail list , which on its face seems like an easy task .
However , old code that everyone is afraid to touch , such as e-mail list servers , has the tendency to make anything you want to do outside of the most basic example damn near impossible .
" After banging my head on something as simple as a single list for some friends I realized that this crap had n't changed since I last used it 10 + years ago , " he tells The Reg .
" I then got thinking about how it should work , and realized that doing an email application should be like every other modern application we build today .
There should be a simple start for a developer , clear documentation , a framework , a modern language , well defined protocols , commented code , and you should be able to extend it without painful configuration .
You know , a lot like Django , Rails , or Cocoa , . NET , or just about any other platform today . "
With Lamson , writing an application that centers around e-mail becomes a painless exercise .
Anyone familiar with modern web application development will understand the idioms : Lamson uses finite state machines to keep track of users ' interactions with the application , templating to generate message text , and makes it easy to use what you know about Model - View - Controller development to write your e-mail app .
All safely contained within the confines of Python , it protects you from having to rusty - hatchet your way through some ghastly XML configuration file for an enterprise messaging library whose name prominently contains the letter " J . "
Indeed , the Java world has taken a stab at e-mail , but has failed miserably .
" They did n't provide a full stack or try to clean things up .
They missed out on the idea of providing a modern server and a modern framework for using the server .
I think that 's probably just how Java guys did things back then , " Zed explains .

Bloody Date
Were you always a fan of horror movies ?
Oh yeah .
I was crazy into video games in elementary school , but when I started junior high I made a conscious effort to watch more horror .
By high school I was totally hooked .
What started you down that dark and gory road ?
John Carpenter's .
I was always curious about the Horror section of my rental shop .
“ What could be on these ? ”
When I finally worked up the courage to find out , I choseWhen were you born ?
1986 .
That was right when the horror boom was dying out .
Did you ever see John Carpenter 'sYeah .
It 's his masterpiece .
I 'd love to do it in clay !
It stands up extremely well .
Right around the time you were born there was a surge of horror movies fueled by rental stores .
I rented awful C - grade movies by the armload , tons of stuff by Herschell Gordon Lewishem , the granddaddy of splatter films .
So many movies featured half naked girls and buckets of spurting blood .
People like watching them precisely because they 're low - class .
I can see the same appeal in your films .
The people that get it ca n’t get enough .
But in terms of technique , you 're top class .
That ’s what sets you apart .
Thank you .
I was always playing catch - up with the films I missed — I 'm jealous of those who experienced it in real - time .
I read in an old magazine article how the Tokyo International Fantastic Film Festival used to be dominated by horror .
When did you begin claymation ?
One day in high school , the art teacher brought in a camera and some clay was proposed that we make something .
That 's when I first realized that I could make these on my own .
My first film wasWere you always working from a grotesque angle ?
Yeah .
But at first I was n't consciously trying to make horror movies using clay .
That would n’t be until I entered college .
That ’s also where I started using sound ; the films I showed in high school were all silent .
Were your early films taken on video ?
The old fashioned way — pressing start and stop on the video camera !
Your first productions were no - frill affairs .
How about now ?
Now I record with a digital camera .
I upload the data onto my computer and edit it frame by frame .
is your definitive work .
The husband is getting it with the maid , so where 's his wife ?
There 's no wife .
Just his daughter then .
So if the maid starts something funny with the husband …
The maid is like a mother to the daughter .
She takes good care of her .
It 's a healthy relationship .
The animation is quite nuanced .
I was particularly surprised by scene where the father is silently drinking coffee at the table after the girls pukes out her guts .
That 's a fan favorite .
Scenes like that are where you truly shine .
The impetus for the scene was simple .
There was coffee on the table , and I needed some sort of action .
I 've never seen acting like that in a horror movie .
It feels like real life , seeing people in extreme situations going about their daily business .
If I were in the same situation , I 'd probably have drunk the coffee too .
The main character is bitten by a zombie , so why does n't he turn ?
I had planned to have a scene where the maid is taking care of the zombified husband .
But I had to complete the film in time for the school movie festival so it got cut .
I think the ending wraps everything up nicely as is .
I was happy with the simple ending .
But the zombie fans E - mail me asking , “ Why does n't the husband become a zombie ? ” ( Laughs ) Can we expect a sequel ?
You bet .
But it wo n’t be a continuation of this story .
I 'm thinking of setting the next one in the middle ages .
The maid would be the princess ’ chambermaid , or a servant of the royal family .
A zombie plague is spreading through the townspeople — something like that .
What can you tell us about what your next film ?
I ’m working on the framework .is a contender .
I thought Ihad exhausted the splatter genre withso I wanted to do something different with , but during productionhad a surge of popularity over You Tube .
That made me want to make another splatter film .
If I did , the gore would far exceed .
It will have to be absolutely brutal !
The stage is set for your claymation version ofI would want to push clay to the limit and make impossible shapes .
The special effects in the film are impressive considering that they were done before the advent of CG .
They actually made everything you see on screen .
Made in their nightmare factory .
Special effects used to be artistic .
I 'd like to do that kind of 80 ’s goopy gore .
You could remake the pottery wheel scene from , only have Patrick Swayze come from behind and devour Demi Moore 's head .
Sounds like great negative publicity .
Swayze 's head has to open up into a mess of teeth .
The hardest part would be the pottery wheel .
John Carpenter 'sThis is making me want to put another cute character in my film …
Go for it .
Something like
That would work !
Cute characters in claymation are all cut from the same mold as Pingu .
The world is filled with cuteness .
How about John Carpenter 's
“ The monster 's hiding inside one of us ! ” I could roll with that ( laughs ) .

“ Natural gas lines of Basij Head quarters were set on fire after Basijie ’s ( paramilitary ) locked themselves inside . ”
Unverified amateur video June 20 2009 from LiveLeak.com Quotes from LiveLeak
The Basij were armed thugs organized and protected by the ruling party in Iran .
They rode around on motorcycles beating and shooting civilians in the protests .
They were also involved in sniper killings of protesters .
“ At 0:05 in the video you can see the whole building exploding .
It is said that at least 5 from Basijies were killed .
Fires are burning in different parts of city . ”
The Basij are paramilitary first organized by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1979 .
They were initially young men unfit for military service .
Khomeini used them as cannon fodder in the human wave attacks against Saddam Hussein ’s army in the Iran – Iraq war .
They were sent into battle as human waves .
From Wikipedia
Duties
“ After the end of the Iran–Iraq War in 1988 , the number of Basij check points dramatically decreased , but the Basij are still active in monitoring the activities of citizens .
They enforce hijab , arresting women for violating the dress code , arrest youths for attending mixed gender parties or being in public with unrelated members of the opposite sex , seize ‘ indecent ’ material and satellite dish antennae . [ 1 ]
Along with the Iranian riot police and the Ansar - e - Hezbollah , the Basij have been active in recent years in suppressing student demonstrations in Iran .
The Basij are sometimes differentiated from the Ansar in being more “ disciplined ” and not beating , or at least not being as quick to beat demonstrators . ”
“ In 1988 college Basiji organizations were established on college campuses to fight “ Westoxification ” and potential student agitation against the government . ”
“ Basij also acts as an emergency management service , and is actively mobilized in case of earthquakes and other natural or human - made disasters .
According to the Jordan Institute of Diplomacy and GlobalSecurity.org , Basij forces also enforce Iran ’s Islamic codes together with other law enforcement organisations , though this also has experienced a considerable decline . ”
“ In November 23 , 2000 civil defense exercises in Iran , armed Basijis took up positions in the streets and along strategic locations . ”
“ Basij forces often undertake general security checks in urban areas setting up street inspection posts to intercept drug smuggling and potential insurgency . ”
“ Some believe the change in focus of the Basij from its original mission of fighting to defend Iran in the Iran - Iraq War to its current internal security concerns has led to a loss in its prestige and morale .
According to an unnamed “ seasoned analyst ” quoted by csmonitor.com , “ You define yourself by your enemies , and those were the superpowers back then .
…
But now they are fighting young people who put gel in their hair .
That ’s the enemy .
So it ’s demeaning , and not at all elevating for their self - image . ”
Revival
“ GlobalSecurity.org reports that the Basij appear “ to be undergoing something of a revival under the administration of President Mahmud Ahmadinejad . ”
“ In late September 2005 , the Basij staged a series of urban defense exercises across the country .
Its first deputy commander announced the creation of 2,000 “ Ashura battalions ” within the Basij that will have “ riot - control responsibilities . ”
Some speculate the recent “ revival ” of the Basij could be connected “ with preparations for possible civil unrest . ”
“ The Iranian Government has exercised a manifold of different plans to keep the Basij alive .
Among these plans is the emphasis on ideas such as Development Basij ( Basij - e - Sazandegi ) .
Fars News Agency reported .
“ Among the most important tasks of the Basij are boosting everlasting security , strengthening development infrastructures , equipping resistance bases , [ and ] increasing employment , ” Hejazi added .
He described the prohibition of vice and the promotion of virtue in society as the “ divine policy ” of the Basij . ”

To recover compensation for their injuries , a victim usually needs to prove that the defendant was negligent .
This means that the defendant failed to act with the appropriate level of care in the situation , and the victim was injured as a result .
Proving negligence is a highly fact - intensive task , since the standard of care varies depending on the circumstances .
Our San Mateo personal injury attorneys understand how to gather and present the evidence needed to establish liability .
Our firm has helped victims across the Bay Area bring claims based on brain injuries , spinal cord injuries , amputations , severe burns , organ damage , and other catastrophic injuries .
The stakes are high in these cases , since the victim may never fully recover from these injuries .
Thus , the lives of the victim and their family members may be changed forever .
In many cases , expert testimony from doctors , vocational experts , and other professionals can help explain the scope of the victim ’s injuries and their impact on the victim ’s future .
After a tragic accident claims a victim ’s life , their family members may not know where to turn .
California law allows certain people to bring a wrongful death claim in these situations , including a surviving spouse , domestic partner , or child .
In addition , certain people who were financially dependent on the victim may be able to bring a claim , such as the victim ’s parents or stepchildren .
The victim ’s estate may recover certain types of damages , while the victim ’s family may recover other damages .
The personal injury attorneys at our San Mateo firm will fight for the full range of damages to which you may be entitled .
For example , the estate may recover compensation for the victim ’s medical bills , lost income , and burial and funeral expenses , while family members may recover compensation for the loss of their loved one ’s financial and moral support , affection , and guidance .
Careless driving causes serious collisions each day in the Bay Area .
For example , a driver may fail to yield at an intersection , speed recklessly , text while driving , or drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs .
When a driver fails to take the proper precautions to protect the safety of people around them , a victim can hold them liable for damages .
These usually include compensation for the victim ’s medical bills and lost income , in addition to their pain and suffering .
Future items of loss also may be recovered in many cases .
The weight of a commercial vehicle results in a devastating impact when it strikes a passenger car .
A victim of a truck accident can sue the truck driver who caused the accident , and they often can hold a trucking company accountable as well .
A trucking company may be directly liable for a crash if it failed to properly train or supervise the driver , or if it retained a driver who was unfit or unqualified to operate a truck .
Moreover , the trucking company may be indirectly liable if the crash occurred while the driver was on the job .
The personal injury lawyers at our San Mateo firm will bring all the at - fault parties into the litigation after a truck accident .
Motorcyclists have an equal right to use the road , but drivers of standard vehicles often fail to respect this right .
A driver may fail to yield to a motorcyclist at an intersection or maneuver aggressively in the presence of a motorcyclist , among other dangerous behaviors .
Sometimes a driver or their insurer will try to argue that a motorcyclist was at fault for an accident .
This would trigger the pure comparative negligence rule in California , which reduces a victim ’s compensation award in proportion to their percentage of fault .
We know how to fight back against unfair allegations of negligence by a motorcyclist so that their right to compensation is fully preserved .
Bicycles offer an environmentally friendly and frequently enjoyable way to travel around the Bay Area .
Like motorcycle riders , however , bicyclists have no protection from the elements .
They tend to suffer especially serious injuries when a careless driver strikes them .
For example , a driver may fail to check their blind spots for bicycles or fail to notice a bicyclist when they are making a turn .
You should promptly consult our San Mateo personal injury lawyers if you suffered injuries in a bicycle accident so that we can start building your claim .
Drivers must yield to pedestrians in California at any marked or unmarked crosswalk .
They also need to exercise reasonable care when they see a pedestrian in the roadway to avoid a collision .
Pedestrian accidents can be catastrophic , since the human body is not built to withstand the impact of a car or truck .
Compensation awards thus may be substantial in these cases , accounting for a broad range of physical , emotional , and financial harm .
If a victim dies from their injuries , their family members may be able to pursue a wrongful death claim .
People trust bus drivers to operate their vehicles carefully as part of their job .
However , bus drivers are human and can make careless mistakes , such as failing to check blind spots , making improper turns , speeding , or driving while distracted .
Passengers on the bus and people in other vehicles struck by the bus may have claims against the driver and the entity that operated the bus .
While some buses are operated by private entities , many buses are operated by the government .
Special requirements apply to claims against the government , and the personal injury attorneys at our San Mateo firm can navigate these obstacles on your behalf .
The Pacific Ocean and the San Francisco Bay provide many opportunities for recreation on the water .
If an operator of a boat fails to handle the vessel properly , serious injuries can result .
Inexperienced , poorly trained , distracted , or intoxicated operators can make errors that lead to a collision or an incident involving sinking or tipping .
In other cases , a defective component of a boat may cause a fire or another type of accident .
When this happens , a victim may have a claim against the manufacturer of the component .
The construction industry poses an elevated level of risk to people who work in it .
Construction workers may fall from heights , suffer crushing injuries from heavy equipment , or suffer blows from vehicles or falling objects .
If the accident occurred on the job , a construction worker should be able to recover workers ’ compensation benefits , which provide medical coverage and partial wage replacement .
In addition , a victim may be able to pursue a third - party personal injury claim with the assistance of a personal injury lawyer in San Mateo if someone other than their employer caused the accident .
A third - party claim can result in additional compensation , such as damages for pain and suffering .
Among the most challenging types of injuries are traumatic brain injuries , which can affect a victim ’s cognitive and emotional condition as well as their physical health .
Brain injuries are often divided into closed head injuries and penetrating head injuries .
Closed head injuries occur when the brain is jolted by an impact , but the skull remains intact .
Penetrating head injuries occur when an object breaks through the skull .
Symptoms of brain injuries may not appear immediately , so victims should monitor their condition after an accident for signs such as disorientation , memory loss , mood changes , and severe headaches .
Many car accident victims suffer from whiplash and herniated discs , which are common types of spinal cord injuries that may be caused by a sudden impact .
In more serious cases , victims may experience a type of paralysis , such as paraplegia or quadriplegia .
Paraplegia affects the body below the waist , while quadriplegia affects the body below the neck .
Spinal cord injuries are often classified as complete or incomplete , which describes the loss of communication between the nerves below the injury and the brain .
The personal injury attorneys at our San Mateo firm provide compassionate representation to victims who are coping with these life - altering injuries .

10 . Callie Rogers
Callie Rogers won £ 1.9 million ( about $ 3 million at the time ) in a UK lottery .
The ecstatic 16 - year - old spent her winnings on vacations , homes , shopping , friends , and even a couple of breast improvements .
Six years later , Rogers is a 22 - year - old single mother of two .
She now works as a maid to sustain herself and her family .

1. Nirvana , In Utero ( 1993 )
“ Teenage angst has paid off well / Now I ’m bored and old ” go the blunt first lines of “ Serve The Servants , ” the opening track on In Utero , Nirvana ’s prickly follow - up to its millions - selling major - label phenomenon Nevermind .
Fed up with the trappings of fame and the other baggage that went along with his success , Kurt Cobain pushed back with an abrasive album that pointedly rejected the slick , multi-layered studio sound that made Nevermind such a singles factory .
The band threw down the gauntlet by hiring Steve Albini to apply his stripped - down , minimalist production aesthetic to a track list full of dark , sarcastic , self - immolating songs .
( In some people ’s eyes , In Utero is a more concise suicide note than the one that accompanied Cobain ’s death . )
The suits at Geffen famously rejected the album as “ unlistenable ” ( according to Cobain , who may have been exaggerating ) , and it received a little polishing , but the album achieved the raw , aggressive sound that the band seemed to want .
And poor Cobain was so good at writing hooks that the album enjoyed platinum success anyway , thanks to classic singles like “ Heart - Shaped Box ” and “ All Apologies . ”
2. David Milch , John From Cincinnati , ( 2007 )
Over most of his time in show business , David Milch did one thing and did it well : grandiose , eloquent cop dramas .
The guy broke in on Hill Street Blues , then worked his way up to co-creator of NYPD Blue , which set him for life .
From there , he headed to HBO , patron saint of TV auteurs , to create the critically beloved Deadwood , which was killed off after three seasons in a dispute between HBO and Paramount .
Milch then channeled all his pet obsessions , his penchant for obtuseness , and his bitterness at the Deadwood situation into the “ surf noir ” John From Cincinnati , which ended up being a loose retelling of the coming of Christ , shot through with esoteric philosophizing , opaque performances , and dialogue so convoluted that viewers had to listen three or four times to even figure out what was going on .
John could be brilliant in patches , but it was too head - scratchingly strange for most viewers .
Not even a small - but - rabid following or Milch ’s insistence that it was all about how God wanted to prevent a genocide could curb viewer indifference .
3. Lou Reed , Metal Machine Music ( 1975 )
While it is n’t the first solo album most Lou Reed fans reach for today , Sally Ca n’t Dance became Reed ’s highest - charting disc in the U.S.
The album ’s tepid , laidback production — not to mention the notoriety of his previous albums — propelled it into the Top 10 in 1974 , a success that perplexed the notoriously perverse songwriter .
Frustrated by contractual pressure from his record label , and perhaps stricken with a bit of self - disgust at his own mainstream success , Reed responded with one of the most notorious albums in rock history , 1975 ’s Metal Machine Music — four sides of fussed - over distortion , reverb , and sonic unpleasantness .
And while MMM ’s freeform feedback - fest caused much critical groaning on its release , it remains , at least to some ears , far more rewarding than Sally Ca n’t Dance .

4. Dennis Hopper , The Last Movie ( 1971 )
After the monumental commercial and critical success of Easy Rider , Dennis Hopper earned the leverage to do pretty much anything he wanted .
Turns out he wanted to disappear into Peru and make a Jean - Luc Godard / Alejandro Jodorowsky - inspired experiment called The Last Movie , whose chilly reception and fleeting release turned Hopper into a drug - devouring Hollywood exile .
Hopper stars as a stuntman named Kansas who , after shooting a difficult Western about Billy The Kid , decides to stick around in Peru .
He eventually ends up looking for gold , then gets swept up in the madness of some locals who , in imitation of their recent Hollywood visitors , have created wooden cameras and boom mics to “ shoot ” their own movie starring Hopper .
Not afraid to go meta or political , Hopper filled the film with distancing touches and blunt critiques of First World greed .
“ Scene missing ” cards appear alongside images of hands pulling shots into focus .
Twelve minutes into the film , we ’re given a screen reading , “ A Film By Dennis Hopper ” ; it ’s another 13 minutes before the title appears , followed by lots of scenes of corrupt Americans living the high life on the backs of the locals .
The messages look stoner - obvious , the fractured chronology is confusing , and the final stretches dip into hallucinatory madness , but The Last Movie ’s disgust with the very idea of making movies and with movie - made myths is kind of fascinating anyway , even if it ’s pretty easy to see why it never found an Easy Rider - sized audience .
5. Ken and Roberta Williams , Phantasmagoria ( 1995 )
In the ’80s and ’90s , one of the few legitimately dominant computer game companies was Sierra On - Line , and that dominance came almost entirely from one husband - wife team : Ken and Roberta Williams .
Ken programmed Roberta ’s design for the family - friendly fairy - tale riff King ’s Quest and managed to make it the first game in the “ graphic adventure ” genre to use animated sprites .
Roberta continued to design every game in the wildly popular series , but she always seemed to carry a yearning to diversify .
So in the mid-’90s she launched Phantasmagoria , her attempt to do a game as different as possible from the cartoony King ’s Quest games .
Phantasmagoria was a dark , often needlessly violent horror tale with borderline misogynistic overtones and a story all but plagiarized from Stephen King .
Unlike the animated King ’s Quest games , the entire game was done in then - popular full - motion video .
In spite of kind reviews and big sales , Phantasmagoria became an afterthought at year - end awards , and genre enthusiasts rarely play it today .
By the end of the decade , Roberta Williams retired , and graphic adventures largely died as an industry concern .
6. Robert Altman , Brewster McCloud ( 1970 )
Robert Altman was never exactly a mainstream filmmaker , but something about his 1970 anti-war comedy M*A * S * H really clicked with audiences , and people eagerly awaited the next movie from a director with such a unique comic voice and a knack for reaching the younger generation .
They did n’t have to wait long : Altman had another film in the pipeline , Brewster McCloud , starring Bud Cort as an eccentric young man who lives in the Houston Astrodome and dreams of flying .
Brewster McCloud is every bit as shaggy and irreverent as M * A * S*H , but lacks the recognizable milieu and episodic plot of the earlier film , which left audiences more baffled than galvanized .
And MGM did n’t do the movie any favors when they chose to première it at a big party in the Astrodome , attended by Houston locals ( who were n’t exactly on Altman ’s quirky wavelength ) and the national media ( who complained that Altman ’s overlapping dialogue was impossible to hear inside the cavernous arena ) .
Brewster McCloud got labeled a misfire before it even left the chamber , and Altman ’s days as a crowd - pleasing studio darling were effectively over less than six months after they began .
7. Kanye West , 808s And Heartbreak ( 2008 )
By the time he released his fourth album , Kanye West had gone from little - known producer to legitimate rap superstar :
His previous album , Graduation , won three Grammys and went double platinum .
But West had also made a career out of controversial statements , bizarre gestures , and critic - and audience - flummoxing moves , and 808s And Heartbreak was a doozy .
Not only did it depart completely from his usual style , 808s was n’t even a hip - hop record .
Crammed with smooth melodies , R&B - style synth drums , and sung ( well , Auto - Tuned ) vocals about love and loss , it sounded like nothing he or anyone else had ever done .
It instantly became , by mere virtue of its weirdness , the most talked - about album of the year .

8. Neil Young , Time Fades Away ( 1973 )
Neil Young famously observed in the liner notes of 1977 ’s Decade that his hit “ Heart Of Gold ” put him “ in the middle of the road ” and “ traveling there soon became a bore , so I headed for the ditch . ”
Time Fades
Away marked the moment where Young grabbed the wheel of his thriving career and careened into a years - long detour from the mainstream .
Recorded during a mammoth 62 - date arena tour launched in the wake of Harvest , the bestselling album of 1972 and source for “ Heart Of Gold , ” 1973 ’s Time Fades Away featured songs that were pitch - black , half - written , and barely rehearsed — the antithesis of the well - crafted , country - ish folk songs that made Young a superstar .
While Harvest fit comfortably with the music
Young made with Crosby , Stills , Nash & Young , Time Fades Away is a raw document of Young ’s grief and guilt over the heroin - related death of Crazy Horse guitarist Danny Whitten , as well as an early indicator of the even more abrupt stylistic shakeups he ’d make later in his career .
( Trans , anyone ? )
Young later called Time Fades Away his worst album — a distinction it does n’t deserve , but a likely explanation for why it ’s never been officially released on CD .

9. Steven Soderbergh , Kafka ( 1991 )
After winning the Palme d’Or and establishing the commercial viability of independent filmmaking his first time at bat — “ I guess it ’s all downhill from here , ” he famously quipped at the time — Steven Soderbergh was able to write his own ticket for his second movie .
Rather than serving up More Sex , More Lies , More Videotape , however , he opted to tackle a notoriously difficult script by then - unproduced screenwriter Lem Dobbs , one that placed Franz Kafka at the center of a malevolent web of increasingly obscure intrigue .
Aping the stark , shadowy monochrome look of German Expressionism , and devoid of the nuanced character studies that helped audiences connect with Soderbergh ’s breakout debut , Kafka ultimately is n’t a very good film .
But it also signaled Soderbergh as an adventurous , mercurial talent who had no interest in repeating himself .
He ’s confirmed that over and over again in the years since , by following up popular successes like Erin Brockovich and Ocean ’s Eleven with alienating experiments like Full Frontal and The Good German .
10 . The Get Up Kids , On A Wire ( 2002 )
Before Fall Out Boy was a twinkle in Pete Wentz ’s eye and Jimmy Eat World blew up around “ The Middle , ” The Get Up Kids released their second album , Something To Write Home About .
And with that , they temporarily became the biggest thing going in emo , and helped Vagrant Records do what it did with bands like Dashboard Confessional and Saves The Day .
But while the sound and style they helped foster was blowing up around them , The Get Up Kids turned their backs on it all with 2002 ’s muted On A Wire , which traded pop-punk anthems for Scott Litt production , campfire songs , and the kind of maturity greeted by lots of folded arms at shows .
The intentional finger given to the band ’s past was confirmed a few years later in an Alternative Press oral history that included bassist Rob Pope admitting , “ We did n’t want to be the ‘ emo ’ poster boys , ” while keyboardist James Dewees saw the writing on the wall : “ I felt like we were committing career suicide . ”
That ’s more or less what happened :
On A Wire flopped , and fewer fans were around to hear the band rock out more on the follow - up , Guilt Show , GUK ’s swan song .
( Its temporary swan song , at least ; the band recently reunited . )

11 . Tom Patchett and Jay Tarses , Buffalo Bill ( 1983 - 1984 )
Tom Patchett and Jay Tarses spent their careers before Buffalo Bill working at the MTM sitcom factory , a production studio known for its warm - hearted , caring shows about witty , urbane professionals .
The two cut their teeth on The Bob Newhart Show , and the push - and - pull between their darker sensibilities and that show ’s typical MTM milieu created the famed surreality of the show ’s middle seasons .
After leaving MTM , though , Patchett and Tarses were given carte blanche by a struggling NBC , and they followed those darker sensibilities until they created Buffalo Bill , a Dabney Coleman vehicle about an egotistical asshole of a talk - show host .
In today ’s TV - comedy landscape , it would fit just fine , but in the early ’ 80s , viewers tuned out in droves , in spite of the show ’s awards nominations and critical acclaim .
Patchett and Tarses ’ partnership broke up acrimoniously after Bill went off the air after two short seasons , but it remains one of the few TV shows genuinely ahead of its time .

12 . Radiohead , Kid A ( 2000 )
After the smashing success of Pablo Honey and The Bends , Radiohead backlashed against alt - rock pigeonholing with OK Computer .
That turned out to be a smashing success as well .
Never much of a rock star , Thom Yorke was pretty burnt out by the spotlight , suffering from depression , lashing out at the media , and getting completely sick of rock music — and the melodies , harmonies , and choruses that went along with it .
So Kid A did what OK Computer would n’t : eschewed singles , music videos , guitars , coherent lyrics , and anything else fans might want or expect .
Layering electronics atop electronica , indulging in ambience , sprinkling in orchestration and noise - jazz , dabbling in nontraditional instruments ( hey , is that the Ondes Martenot ? ) , and picking lyrics out of a hat , Radiohead strung together musical abstractions and passed it off as a pop album .
Justifying renewed faith in music fans worldwide , Kid A still entered the charts at No. 1 on three continents and was nominated for an Album Of The Year Grammy .

13 . Stephen King , Different Seasons ( 1982 )
In the afterword to Different Seasons , Stephen King describes how his first agent warned him of the dangers of being typecast as a horror writer ; years later , when he decided to publish Seasons , he had to deal with objections to breaking that type .
In the early ’ 80s , King had yet to reach his peak fame as the Master Of The Macabre , but he was well on his way with novels like ’ Salem ’s Lot and The Shining .
Different Seasons offers a different kind of storytelling : four novellas , only one of which has the kind of supernatural horror that made King famous .
Two of these novellas , “ Rita Hayworth And Shawshank Redemption ” and “ The Body ” are n’t horror at all , but “ Apt Pupil ” was the one that really put readers ’ teeth on edge .
The tale of a kid ’s obsession with the Nazi next door is by definition frightening , but it ’s also off - putting and vicious in ways King rarely tried , full of gassed hobos and childish sexual fantasies .
These days , Seasons is just further proof of King ’s popular appeal .
All three of its non-supernatural sections have been adapted into films , and in the years since its publication , King has never been reluctant to try new things .
But it came as a shock to readers at the time , like getting anchovies on a birthday cake .
[ pagebreak ] 14 .
Mos Def , The New Danger ( 2004 )
Black Star ’s 1998 manifesto Mos Def And Talib Kweli Are Black Star and Mos Def ’s 1999 solo debut Black On Both Sides made the rapper / actor / activist a hero to a generation of college kids and backpackers nostalgic for the glory days of The Native Tongues .
Mos Def looked primed for greatness until a thriving acting career began to monopolize his time , and a dodgy - sounding rock project ( to be called Black Jack Johnson ) threatened to derail his music career .
Def returned in 2004 with The New Danger , a Frankenstein monster of an album that combined tracks from the aborted Jack Johnson sessions with new hip - hop tracks steeped in paranoia .
“ The Rape Over ” made longtime fans queasy / uneasy with lyrics about how a “ tall Israeli ” and “ quasi- homosexual ” were running hip - hop .
( The track was mysteriously pulled from later printings . )
The New Danger was a dark , uncertain album for a dark , uncertain era , and it left early fans wondering what happened to the idealism and warmth of Def ’s early work .

15 . Martin Scorsese , New York , New York ( 1977 )
Martin Scorsese has made a career out of defying expectations , but even longtime fans were a little surprised when Scorsese followed up his iconic 1976 masterpiece Taxi Driver with a musical .
True , 1977 ’s New York , New York owed as much to John Cassavetes as Arthur Freed , and it featured Robert De Niro at his most abrasive and off - putting ( no small feat , considering his oeuvre ) , but it nevertheless belonged to a moribund genre that Scorsese and his fellow cinematic mavericks were supposed to have helped kill .
New York , New York was gloriously , maddeningly representative of an age when auteurs were free to let their marauding ids lead them down all kinds of dark alleys .
16 . Michael Cimino , Heaven ’s Gate ( 1980 )
Also representative of that age : Michael Cimino ’s notorious 1980 revisionist Western Heaven ’s Gate .
The left - field success of The Deer Hunter afforded the famously prickly , indulgent director the power and clout to get financing for a defiantly non-commercial epic about brutal class struggles in 19th - century Wyoming .
The film ’s budget quickly spiraled , along with its running time and scope .
Cimino ultimately turned in a rough cut that ran more than five hours , cost more than $ 40 million , and almost single - handedly destroyed United Artists .
A messy , sprawling , overreaching film whose merits have been angrily contested over the past three decades , Heaven ’s Gate confirmed Cimino ’s status as an auteur with a strong , unique vision , while killing his reputation as a guy who could get films made .
17 . Alice Sebold , The Almost Moon ( 2007 )
Alice Sebold ’s first novel , The Lovely Bones , was an instant mega - bestseller , widely purchased and widely praised for its lyrical language and strange , melancholy sweetness .
For a story about a raped , murdered teenager who quietly watches the aftermath of her death from the afterlife , it felt oddly comforting and nurturing , with an overall feeling that no matter how bad life gets , there ’s something better — and non-religious , and non-judgmental — waiting in the great beyond .
Which may be why so many people were shocked five years later by Sebold ’s follow - up , The Almost Moon .
Written in a blunter style and about blunter topics , it follows a shell - shocked woman who kills her abusive mother , then embarks on a series of increasingly unlikely , grotesque decisions .
It was as if Sebold had left heaven behind in order to concentrate on that “ just how bad life can get ” part .
Granted , plenty of great literature follows that theme , but Almost Moon ’s muddled story and even more muddled first - person narrator — who seemed to have no idea why she was dragging readers through such muck — did n’t invite sympathy , or even sustained interest .

18 . N.W.A , EFIL4ZAGGIN ( 1991 )
After rapper / chief - ghostwriter Ice Cube left , N.W.A. faced a dilemma , then a conundrum , then a big question :
What do you do for a follow - up when you ’ve shocked the world , transformed pop music , and lost one of your key voices ?
N.W.A.’s answer was to plunge even deeper into the shock , sex , and violence of its classic debut Straight Outta Compton , while eschewing much of the pop slickness that characterized Dr. Dre ’s earlier production .
EFIL4ZAGGIN ( a.k.a. NIGGAZ4LIFE ) took N.W.A. ’s nihilistic ethos as far as it could possibly go , so it ’s probably for the best that the most dangerous group in America disbanded soon after the album ’s release .

19 . Ben Folds Five , The Unauthorized Biography Of Reinhold Messner ( 1999 )
With its breakthrough album Whatever And Ever Amen , The Ben Folds Five fused the classic piano - based songcraft of Joe Jackson and Todd Rundgren with the smartass sarcasm of Generation X. Folds quickly developed a reputation as a piano - pounding jokester , but there was always melancholy just under the surface .
Folds and company ’s brooding follow - up , The Unauthorized Biography Of Reinhold Messner , wore its rough edges proudly .
It ’s an intentionally messy album that veers from tortured self - reflection ( “ Mess ” ) to strangely moving experimentation ( “ Your Most Valuable Possession , ” a song built around a half - lucid answering - machine message left by Folds ’ father ) to goofy toss - offs ( “ Your Redneck Past ” ) .
Though it failed to live up to its predecessors ’ sales , Folds clearly has a soft spot for it ;
The trio recently reunited to perform the album in its entirety for MySpace ’s “ Front To Back ” series .

20 . The Monkees , Head ( 1968 )
1968 found The Monkees ’ career at a critical juncture .
Auditioned and assembled to star in a Beatles - inspired TV show by producers Bert Schneider and Bob Rafelson , the cobbled - together band champed at the bit for more creative control over its work .
By ’ 68 , The Monkees had wrestled some of the power away from their puppetmasters , only to watch their show get canceled .
And though they scored a hit in March with “ Valleri , ” the boys were n’t exactly burning up the charts the way they used to .
The backlash kicked in hard , as old fans abandoned them for acts without the taint of the pop-factory assembly line .
( Like , you know , The Lemon Pipers and 1910 Fruitgum Company , man . )
The solution : a major motion picture directed by Rafelson — who co-penned the script with Jack Nicholson , a B - movie actor looking to establish a screenwriting career — that would be so weird and self - deprecating that the public would be shocked into embracing The Monkees all over again .
The film opens with the group apparently attempting suicide , then repeatedly mocks the idea of the band as a product — in one scene , they play flakes in a dandruff commercial — between a rambling , seemingly stream - of - consciousness parody of whatever occurred to them .
The movie flopped when released in November 1968 , but these days , it ’s a pretty fascinating curio , albeit one without even a fraction of A Hard Day ’s Night ’s timeless appeal .
Winning moments aside , The Monkees remained an imitation to the end .
21 . Fleetwood Mac , Tusk ( 1979 )
While not exactly abrasive , Tusk was certainly jarring to many of Fleetwood Mac ’s millions of fans , most of whom had been waiting two years for the follow - up to the hit - laden phenomenon of Rumours .
Allegedly inspired by the experimentation of punk and new wave — although more believably the result of way too much cocaine and way too high a recording budget — Lindsey Buckingham spiked Tusk ’s stark , dreamy rock with annoyingly bizarre compositions like “ The Ledge ” and “ That ’s Enough For Me , ” the jerky , shrill “ Not That Funny , ” and the drifting disconnectedness of “ That ’s All For Everyone . ”
As an artistic statement , it was a brave one for the Mac to take , and it stands as one hell of a curveball from a band that never gets enough props for its edginess .

22 . Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark , Dazzle Ships ( 1983 )
“ If You Leave , ” OMD ’s contribution to the soundtrack to the late John Hughes ’ Pretty In Pink , is doubtlessly the band ’s signature song .
But its 1981 album Architecture & Morality was its breakthrough , selling millions of copies and putting the synth - pop group on the map in its native England .
But rather than continuing that arc of increasingly palatable new wave , OMD chased Architecture with 1983 ’s Dazzle Ships , a disc seemingly pieced together out of eerie samples , prickly static , and a phalanx of malfunctioning factory robots .
The challenging , often puzzling album was coolly received on its release , which led to the band ’s headfirst leap into the pure teen pop of “ If You Leave ” — but Dazzle Ships has had a well - deserved resurgence in popularity since its re-release in 2008 .

23 . John Boorman , Zardoz ( 1974 )
It ’s an old story : A giant stone head flies across the countryside , dispensing arms and ammo to the locals ( who are dressed in red underwear and bandoliers ) , and spouting off about the glory of guns and the evil of the penis .
Sean Connery hitches a ride in the head , shoots a man who looks suspiciously like the Peculiar Purple Pieman Of Porcupine Peak , and manages to sneak into a city of ennui filled with craft - fair - obsessed immortals .
And then things get weird .
John Boorman ’s Zardoz is a fascinating failure , a bold narrative vision that manages to be simultaneously breathtaking , pretentious , and achingly dull .
What ’s even more impressive is that the movie was Boorman ’s direct follow - up to the hugely influential Deliverance , a naturalistic thriller typified by its straightforward storytelling and lack of ostentation .
The contrast could hardly be starker , and it does Zardoz , a movie that dies the moment an audience member starts to snicker , no favors .
( Not that Boorman cared ; his follow - up to Zardoz was Exorcist II : The Heretic , which does to audience expectations what Godzilla did to Tokyo . )
24 . Thomas Pynchon , Vineland ( 1990 )
Thomas Pynchon ’s 1973 novel Gravity ’s Rainbow never became a popular success ; like most of his work , it ’s too dense and complex to find a mainstream audience .
But it was a huge critical success , and it went on to become one of the signature novels of the 1970s .
Then , nothing .
Not for 17 years would the mysterious Pynchon produce another work of long fiction , and when it arrived , many of the same critics who had so firmly embraced Gravity ’s Rainbow as the work of a serious man of letters decried Vineland as a deliberately ludicrous , intentionally unserious novel .
Going from Rainbow ’s World War II setting to the ’ 80 - era ninjas , potheads , and Trekkies of Vineland infuriated critics who never much cared for Pynchon ’s pop-culture obsessions and wild sense of humor .
As a result , they tended to minimize or ignore the book ’s many virtues — a pattern that repeated itself with the recent Against The Day and Inherent Vice .

25 . John Lennon , John Lennon / Plastic Ono Band ( 1970 )
In case he had n’t already made it abundantly clear on his savage 1970 solo debut John Lennon / Plastic Ono Band , John Lennon explicitly stated his rejection of The Beatles and ’60s idealism on the album ’s penultimate song “ God , ” declaring , “ The dream is over . ”
But for anyone paying attention , the dream ended with the doom - laden church bells that open “ Mother , ” an uncomfortably intimate track that ends with Lennon ’s screaming pleas for his parents not to abandon him .
In contrast with The Beatles ’ lushly reassuring swan song Abbey Road , the bone - dry Plastic Ono Band hits hard with unrelentingly grimness , stripping away Lennon ’s superstar image , one incredibly fucked - up layer at a time .
Lennon essentially committed his primal - scream therapy sessions to tape , consciously demolishing his hero status in the process .
26 . Walter Wangerin , Jr. , The Book Of Sorrows ( 1985 )
Walter Wangerin , Jr. ’s 1978 novel
The Book Of The Dun Cow is a strange but terrific fable , brimming with fantasy tropes and religious metaphor , but able to stand on its own either as a conventional fantasy novel or an allegory about faith , courage , and sacrifice .
It won the National Book Award and The New York Times declared it the best children ’s book of the year , but it is n’t really for children , in spite of its talking - animal cast and broad good - vs. - evil story .
In the book , a rooster struggles with his pride and weakness while defending his people from a grimly bloody , murderous invasion .
It ’s Animal Farm on a cosmic scale , written with respect both for the mundane details of animal life and the Biblical big picture .
In the end , victory is hard - won and full of lessons about pain and grief .
In the utterly inexplicable 1985 sequel , The Book Of Sorrows , Wangerin focuses solely on grief rather than victory , as the survivors of the first book basically give into despair and destroy themselves over hundreds of agonizingly pointless pages that undo every hard - won victory from the first film .
Dun Cow reads like an act of faith ; the follow - up is an act of hateful nihilism .

27 . Weezer , Pinkerton ( 1996 )
In 2009 , it ’s common knowledge that Rivers Cuomo is a weirdo , but in 1996 , the world only knew him as the man behind some inescapable hits from Weezer ’s 1994 debut .
The world ’s first glance into Cuomo ’s eccentric , twisted psyche arrived with 1996 ’s Pinkerton , which clouded its predecessor ’s sunny power - pop with deep - seated angst .
Full of contradiction , it simultaneously evokes longing ( “ Across The Sea , ” “ Falling For You , ” “ Butterfly , ” “ The Good Life ” ) and emotional lethargy ( “ Tired Of Sex , ” “ Why Bother ? ” ) .
For all of its darkness , Pinkerton still had plenty of hooks , but its darkness turned off the casual fans who tuned in during “ Buddy Holly . ”
As such , it sold poorly upon its release , and Weezer essentially broke up after touring for it .
But Pinkerton had legs , becoming a fan favorite in the decade after its release — a reputation solidified by Weezer ’s string of sub - par albums following its reformation in 2000 .

( CNN ) -- Forgot to charge your cell phone last night ?
Imagine that you could power it by walking .
Weirder still , you might be able to just spray a new battery on .
Z.L. Wang shows an enlarged image of zinc oxide nanowires , less than the width of a hair in reality .
These concepts are being developed by two leading nanotechnology researchers who are developing cleaner , more efficient ways of delivering electrical power .
In working toward making these ideas realities , they are making use of structures that are 100 nanometers or smaller , where one nanometer is a billionth of a meter .
" [ The nanoscale ] can make the components small , sensitive and high - performance , " said Zhong Lin " Z.L. "
Wang , distinguished professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology 's College of Engineering .
" The toughness and the flexibility increase by orders of magnitude . "
Barely lifting a finger
Wang and colleagues are working on harnessing the energy of the body 's natural movements to power small devices .
Even the simple act of moving your fingers while typing creates energy that could power a small device , and these researchers are showing that nanotechnology can enable this transformation .
Here 's the hard science :
To take advantage of animal movement for energy , Wang 's team makes use of the piezoelectric effect , which refers to the ability of certain materials to generate an electric potential when a stress is applied to them .
For instance , if you compress a crystal , it temporarily changes shape , causing the ions inside the crystal to polarize and produce a voltage drop .

That potential can drive a transient flow of external electrons to function as an energy output .

Zinc oxide nanowires , which are environmentally friendly , have this property .
Wang and colleagues are using these materials in making solar cells , which would have less potentially harmful impact on the environment than the traditionally - used silicon .
They also use them make nanogenerators that can potentially harvest the energy from any mechanical movement .
The group had success in animal models -- for instance , in harvesting energy from a hamster running on a wheel that wears a nanodevice on its back .
They have also implanted a nanogenerator on the heart of a mouse , and are able to capture energy from just the heart beat -- albeit only some picowatts ( one million millionth of a watt ) .
The eventual goal is to create a way for people to self - power a blood pressure or glucose monitor -- for instance , by implanting a small device in the arm .

" Within three years , the power generated should be enough to power these kinds of devices , " Wang said .
Wang also demonstrated how one of these tiny devices on a wire attached to a person 's finger can harvest energy from stretching and bending the finger .
' Next - next generation ' batteries
Scientists want to develop energy sources based on inexpensive , abundant , eco-friendly materials that generate higher power .
At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , researchers are doing that by engineering viruses that build materials for batteries .
" We 're letting biology help us work on solving those problems , solving what the next - next generation batteries are going to be , " said Angela Belcher , professor of materials science and engineering at MIT and winner of a 2004 MacArthur Foundation genius grant .
Here 's how it works :
Belcher and colleagues synthesize a virus called M13 bacteriophage , which is wire - shaped and only about 9 nanometers thin .
This virus is common -- " you have bacteriophage all over you , " Belcher said -- and is harmless to humans .
A traditional battery has a negatively charged " anode " and a positively charged " cathode , " and charged particles called ions flow between them .
As they demonstrated in a paper in the journal Science in April , a cathode can be made when engineered viruses coat themselves with iron phosphate , then bind to carbon nanotubes , which are cylindrical carbon molecules .
The result is an extremely conductive network of these nanotubes .
Ten grams of their cathode materials can power one portable media player for about 40 hours , which is equivalent to three normal portable media batteries in the same device , Belcher said .
In 2006 , the team showed that the anode could also be built by viruses -- this time , coating themselves with cobalt oxide and gold .
The viruses essentially become small wires .
Given that the battery grows itself , there 's basically no manufacturing waste .
No toxic materials are involved either , Belcher said .
During the assembly process , the viruses are not alive , Belcher said .
" They 're just a protein scaffold to be able to grab ions out of solution or build materials exactly the way we need them to grow , " she said .
Once the battery is made , the virus can no longer make copies of itself , she said .
While the current prototypes are powerful , they wo n't come to market because researchers want to make them out of even better materials .
In five or 10 years , though , they could be available for specialty applications , Belcher said .
She and colleagues are also working on spray - on batteries -- just spray on the components , including the viruses , like spray paint -- and batteries that attach like rubber stamps .
The stampable batteries could be used for cards on which information is stored , such as IDs and credit cards , she said .
The business of nanotech
Some of the nanotech energy devices sold today include nano - enhanced lithium ion batteries that perform better and are safer than their predecessors , he said .
Several companies also are working on flexible solar cells -- meaning one day " you could even have something like an awning or a backpack made out of a material that produces solar electricity , " said Michael Holman , research director at Lux Research , an independent research and advisory firm providing advice about emerging technologies .
But " there 's still a big disconnect between the hype and the reality , " of nanotechnology in the energy sector , he said .
Only 0.6 percent of nanotech revenues in 2007 came from energy and environment applications , according to a report from Lux , and they predict only 1.8 percent in 2015 .
Holman cautioned that many of the technologies that have come to the market , such as the lithium ion batteries , are incremental advances rather than breakthroughs .
Still , the studies that Wang and Belcher are doing are important , he said .
It may be decades before human motion could translate into more than a small fraction of general energy use , but in the nearer term it could hold promise in small sensor applications such as environmental monitoring , Holman said .
Belcher 's work on batteries is " exactly the kind of research we need to keep doing " as scientists progress toward goals such as powering electric cars , for example , he said .

An advert for an " exceptional fisherman 's cottage " in Kent has been criticised for failing to mention the nuclear power station on its doorstep .
The three - bedroom " not to be missed " bungalow at Dungeness is being sold for £ 247,000 .
Estate agent Geering & Colyer points out its proximity to a nature reserve and photos show it in rural isolation .
But New Romney Town Council said it was " disingenuous " not to mention its neighbours , Dungeness A and B .
Even if the power plants were not included in the pictures , mention should have been made about them being nearby

There are also plans to build a new nuclear reactor , Dungeness C , nearby .
Valerie Tully , clerk of New Romney Town Council , said : " There 's really not a lot of point in not being honest because , once you arrive at the place , you can't help but notice the power plants there .
" I suppose they felt people would be put off , but they should also know that the late film producer Derek Jarman lived in the area for many years and we get a lot of visitors .
" Even if the power plants were not included in the pictures , mention should have been made about them being nearby . "
The Dungeness A site , which started generating electricity into the National Grid in 1965 , was decommissioned in 2006 .
Bleak beauty Nearby Dungeness B site will stay open until 2018 .
A spokesman for Geering and Colyer , of New Romney , said : " I 've got no comment to make on it . "
Visitors have long been attracted to the area 's nature reserve , RSPB Dungeness , and the bleak beauty of the nearby shingle bank .
One of its most famous residents , avant - garde artist Derek Jarman , created a garden from driftwood , beach pebbles , old fishing tackle and pieces of twisted metal at Prospect Cottage .
Jarman - at first a relatively inexperienced gardener - wrote about the creation of the garden in his diaries and used it in his films .

When the Obama administration ’s Detention Policy Task Force , established by Executive Order on the President ’s second day in office , conceded last week that it would miss its six - month deadline to issue its recommendations about how to close Guantánamo , many observers focused on whether this meant that Obama would fail to meet his deadline of Jan 21 , 2010 for the closure of the prison , and missed the bigger story , which was only revealed through close scrutiny of the Task Force ’s five - page interim report ( PDF ) .
Disturbingly , this document revealed that the Task Force envisages three options for dealing with the prisoners who will not be released from Guantánamo : trials in federal courts , trials by Military Commission ( the “ terror trials ” introduced by former Vice President Dick Cheney in November 2001 , and revived by Congress in 2006 after the Supreme Court ruled them illegal ) , and indefinite detention without charge or trial .
These proposals accord with plans outlined by the President in a major national security speech in May , but they are no more acceptable now than they were then , for one simple reason : they are designed not to secure justice , but to prevent any of the prisoners who fit into these three categories from being released ; in other words , as Glenn Greenwald reported for Salon , “ If they know they ’ll convict you in a real court proceeding , they ’ll give you one ; if they think they might lose there , they ’ll put you in a military commission ; if they ’re still not sure they will win , they ’ll just indefinitely imprison you without any charges . ”
The proposals put forward by the Task Force — and clearly endorsed by Obama — are bitterly disappointing , not only because they are so shamefully dismissive of the presumption of innocence , and because they reveal a desire to further turn the judicial system on its head by endorsing preventive detention , but also because they are cowardly in the extreme .
There is , to be blunt , no need for the administration to revive the widely reviled Commissions ( criticized in the past by most leading Democrats , including Barack Obama ) , because the federal courts are more than capable of prosecuting terror suspects , having successfully done so on more than a hundred occasions in the last 15 years .
The Task Force itself admitted in its interim report that “ A broad range of terrorism offences with extraterritorial reach are available in the criminal code and procedures exist to protect classified information in federal court trial where necessary , ” and also noted , “ The evidentiary rules at trial are well - established , and experienced prosecutors can often find ways to overcome any challenges those rules may pose to [ the ] introduction of critical evidence in specific cases . ”
In addition , as Glenn Greenwald also explained , “ as a result of breathtakingly broad criminal laws in the US defining ‘ material support for terrorism , ’ there are few things easier than obtaining a criminal conviction in federal court against people accused of being terrorists . ”
Moreover , given that successful prosecutions have taken place in cases where no evidence of actual terrorist activity is required , there is no excuse whatsoever for proposing to continue to hold some prisoners indefinitely , using a form of “ preventive detention ” for which Congressional approval will have to be sought .
If , after seven and a half years , the government cannot even reach the low evidentiary hurdle required by a federal court , then it should stop pretending that it has grounds for believing that these particular prisoners are too dangerous to be released , and let them go .
For the Guantánamo prisoners , it is worrying enough that everyone involved in reviewing their cases for the government appears to have forgotten a number of crucial facts that tend to undermine the illusion that the prison still contains a significant number of terrorists : namely , that the majority of the prisoners were not seized on a battlefield , but were handed over by the US military ’s Afghan and Pakistani allies , at a time when bounty payments , averaging $ 5,000 a head were widespread ( PDF ) ; that they were never screened according to the Geneva Conventions ’ competent tribunals — held close to the time and place of capture — to establish whether they were actually combatants , or civilians caught up in the fog of war ; that , subsequently , they were never adequately screened at Guantánamo , where the process instigated by the Pentagon — the Combatant Status Review Tribunals — was described by a former insider , Lt. Col .
Stephen Abraham , as a farce , in which most of the material put forward as evidence was “ garbage , ” and the entire process was designed to rubberstamp the Bush administration ’s decision that they were all ” enemy combatants , ” who could be held without charge or trial ; and that the majority of the supposed evidence against the men has , indeed , been revealed as deeply untrustworthy when scrutinized by District Court judges .
Following the Supreme Court ’s ruling last summer that the prisoners have habeas corpus rights , judges in the District Courts have , in 84 percent of the cases on which they have delivered a verdict , ruled that the government either had no case at all , or that its cases were based upon statements by unreliable witnesses , who were tortured , coerced or bribed , or had severe mental health problems .
In addition , judges have also poured scorn on attempts to create a “ mosaic ” of intelligence from these and other sources that does not stand up to close examination .
The fact that the Task Force appears not to have fully understood the scale of the Bush administration ’s incompetence regarding the capture and interrogation of the Guantánamo prisoners , and the manifold problems with the supposed evidence against them counts , in the end , as a distressing example of the sort of paranoia for which Dick Cheney is best known triumphing over the kind of common sense and dedication to the pursuit of justice for which Barack Obama seemed to stand just a few short months ago .
Moreover , the Task Force ’s egregious errors are not confined just to the present , and to the question of what will happen to the Guantánamo prisoners .
As the interim report states , “ The Detention Policy Task Force has thus far focused much of its work on developing options for the lawful disposition of detainees held at Guantánamo Bay .
Important questions remain concerning our policies in the future regarding apprehension , detention , and treatment of suspected terrorists , as part of our broader strategy to defeat al - Qaeda and its affiliates . ”
The authors of the report then indicate that they are involved in an ongoing analysis of a number of questions relating to the future , including “ what the rules and boundaries should be for any future detention under the rule of war , ” ignoring , both in the present , and in their deliberations about the future , that the answer has , in fact , been obvious all along , and that , as it appears from this hideous and worrying document , all the talk of alternative trial systems and preventive detention is nothing more than a conjuring trick to disguise policies that , essentially , cleave closely to the arrogant and lawless innovations conceived by senior officials in the Bush administration .
And the answer that has been obvious all along ?
It goes like this :
If your enemy is a combatant , seized in wartime , then you hold him as a prisoner of war according to the Geneva Conventions , which prohibit inhumane treatment and coerced interrogations , until the end of hostilities .
And if your enemy is a terrorist , then you hand him over to interrogators who know how to get a man to talk without using torture , according him the procedural protections in the Bill of Rights , and you put him on trial in a federal court .
It really is that simple .

The Prince of Wales lobbied for one of the world 's leading architects to be dropped from a £ 500 m office and shopping complex beside St Paul 's Cathedral so one of his preferred designers could take over , the Guardian has learned .
The developer who commissioned the Paris - based Jean Nouvel to design One New Change has revealed that the prince called for an alternative architect to be considered for the sensitive site yards from Christopher Wren 's masterpiece .
In a private letter to Land Securities , one of Britain 's largest commercial developers , the prince made clear he felt the firm had got its design approach wrong .
He said he was concerned that the design should " allow St Paul 's to shine bright " and offered his own architectural advisers , who prefer traditional forms , to help .
" He wrote to me at the time we selected Nouvel and suggested we should meet his preferred architects , " said Mike Hussey , then London director of Land Securities .
" He had n't seen the scheme , he just complained about the selection of the architect .
He did n't want a modernist . "
Charles 's intervention , in a letter sent in 2005 , emerged from a wide - ranging investigation by the Guardian into the extent of his sometimes hidden role in shaping Britain 's skyline .
Amid concerns that his hands - on involvement in planning and architecture may exceed his constitutional role , it has also emerged that :
• His aides regularly scrutinise plans by major architects including Sir Terry Farrell , Sir Richard MacCormac , John McAslan and Alan Baxter who work on some of Britain 's largest building projects .
• He told English Heritage 's chairman to urge cabinet ministers to block a £ 200 m development at Smithfield Market in London .
It was rejected and his aides have now been asked to endorse new plans .
• His architecture charity is involved in plans for more than 17,000 homes across Britain – more than Persimmon , one of the country 's largest house builders , built last year .
There were renewed concerns last week about the prince 's influence when five design firms allied to his approach to architecture were selected to draw up draft plans for the Chelsea Barracks site after he successfully persuaded the Qatari developers to sack Richard Rogers .
Like Lord Rogers , Nouvel is a winner of the Pritzker prize , architecture 's version of the Nobel , as well as the Royal Gold Medal , Britain 's highest accolade for an architect .
The prince routinely opposes modernist architecture and advocates traditional styles based on historical precedents .
Sunand Prasad , president of the Royal Institute of British Architects , described the intervention at One New Change as " brazen " and " pernicious " and last night called for him to " step back " .
" The prince has an unusual amount of power which , under our constitution , is not designed to be used to interfere with the running of everyday affairs in this country for the simple reason that the prince is not accountable , " said Prasad .
" This is a dangerous course to go down .
There was an open competition for this building and then along comes somebody with special powers seeking to influence the outcome in a blatant intervention . "
Clarence House confirmed the private letter was sent in 2005 following Nouvel 's appointment .
The architect had won the commission in an international competition and the designs had been submitted to the Corporation of London planning authorities .
Hussey , a leading patron of modernist architecture , decided the prince 's suggestion was " not appropriate " and wrote back to decline the offer .
A spokesman for Clarence House said Charles was concerned to retain St Paul 's " inspirational " status on the London sykline , but declined to comment further on the prince 's private correspondence .
His aides believe the prince is entitled to share his views on the built environment .
They defend his right to intervene over developments close to buildings or sites of national importance as he has done over the National Gallery on Trafalgar Square , the Royal Hospital at Chelsea , and Paternoster Square , also beside St Paul's .
Nouvel was unavailable for comment .
La vera , unica , inimitabile esperienza di vita di un vero GGGGiovane ( C ) alle prese con gli psicofarmaci
Gianluca Morozzi è un autore che stimo sebbene la sua tendenza al plagio abbia oramai assunto carattere patologico .
Non pago di avermi scopiazzato lo stile ( è un vorace lettore del Posto del Vertigo , anche se lui nega recisamente ) ha deciso di scopiazzarmi anche gli articoli scientifici .
Tempo addietro quando ero un giovane di belle speranze munito di borsa di studio e di borsello di ricerca ho convogliato i miei dieci miliardi di neuroni e i miei cento miliardi di sinapsi nella produzione di un articolo di bioetica , dal roboante titolo di “ Il metifelnidato nella terapia del disturbo da deficit d’attenzione : una prospettiva etico - teorica ” ( lo so , suona tremendamente bene ) .
Puntuale come una multa di un ausiliario del traffico Morozzi ha deciso di parlare ora della “ sua ” esperienza col Ritalin ( notate il virgolettato di “ sua ” : so come prendermi le mie rivincite ) .
IO E IL DEFICIT – Pur non essendo Morozzi ( ho una quantità impressionante di capelli al centimetro cubo ) vorrei raccontarvi ora la mia esperienza con il Ritalin lasciando ai posteri l’ardua sentenza di stabilire chi sia il vincitore .
Circa sette anni fa , che iddio abbia pietà di me , mi ero convinto di avere il fantomatico disturbo da deficit d’attenzione , ai più noto come ADHD ( prego qui l’impaginatore di Giornalettismo di inserire il maiuscoletto che fa fino ) .
Erano i primi tempi di Internet , che con il mio macinino a 56 k utilizzavo prevalentemente per due scopi : trombare il più alto numero possibile di giovani sprovvedute e autodiagnosticarmi sindromi psichiatriche .
Scoperto al di là di ogni ragionevole dubbio di avere il disturbo da deficit d’attenzione mi risolsi a trovare uno psichiatra compiacente , che per esigenze di privacy chiameremo con un nome fittizio : Josef Mengele .
Il dott .
Mengele mi prescrisse nel giro di due settimane la seguente lista , non esaustiva , di psicofarmaci : clomipramina , desipramina , imipramina , bupropione , litio , reboxetina , carbamazepina , mirtazapina , trifluoperazina , tranilcipromina nonché l’intera gamma degli antidepressivi serotoninergici , a proposito dei quali credo di essere stato l’unico essere umano al mondo ad averli provati tutti e cinque : fluovoxamina , fluoxetina , citalopram , sertralina e paroxetina ( mi manca invero l’escitalopram ma è una variante del citalopram e quindi secondo me non conta ) .
CIRCOLO VIZIOSO E DEPRESSO – Dopo questa ghiotta indigestione di sostanze psicoattive avevo chiaramente bisogno di uno psichiatra .
Il problema degli psichiatri è che tendono a prescrivere psicofarmaci e il problema degli psicofarmaci è che tendono a indurre effetti collaterali per il controllo dei quali sono necessari ulteriori psicofarmaci , in un ricorso ad infinitum che può ricordare a taluni le vicende di Achille pie ’ veloce e della sua bolsa tartaruga .
Se pensate che stia scherzando vi invito a leggere la mia tesi di dottorato , che tra l’altro è gelosamente custodita nella mia scarpiera , nella quale si afferma a chiare lettere alle pagg .
206-207 quanto segue .
Per il DSM - IV affinché si possa effettuare una diagnosi di depressione devono essere presenti cinque o più dei nove criteri che trovate su Wikipedia .
Di questi nove ben cinque figurano tra gli effetti collaterali della clomipramina , uno degli antidepressivi più diffusi , tanto da essere persino indicati nel bugiardino : affaticamento ( criterio 6 ) , agitazione ( criterio 5 ) , disturbi del sonno ( criterio 4 ) , difficoltà a concentrarsi ( criterio 8 ) , aumento del peso corporeo ( criterio 3 ) .
Ne consegue logicamente che assumere clomipramina , un antidepressivo , induce depressione .
Ancora una volta , se pensate che io stia scherzando , sappiate che nel 2005 la Food & Drug Administration , il ministero della sanità usa , ha chiesto ai produttori dei dieci principali antidepressivi di aggiungere sulle etichette una nota che avverta i consumatori che gli antidepressivi possono aumentare il rischio di suicidio .
E’ come dire che l’insulina aumenta il rischio di diabete , che la vitamina C causa lo scorbuto , che la psichiatria è una scienza e che la mia prosa non è scoppiettante .
L’iter classico dello psicobambino è quindi il seguente .
È distratto e disattento e gli viene prescritto il Ritalin .
Ma quel punto inizia a soffrire di psicosi ( è un effetto possibile del Ritalin ) e gli viene prescritto un antipsicotico .
Ma a quel punto inizia a soffrire di depressione ( è un effetto possibile dell ’ antipsicotico ) e gli viene prescritto un antidepressivo .
Ma a quel punto inizia a soffrire di ansia ( è un effetto possibile dell ’ antidepressivo ) e gli viene prescritto un ansiolitico .
Quale che sia l’effetto dell ’ansiolitico non gli può essere prescritto nient ’ altro , perché i farmaci sono finiti .
Qualche psichiatra molto zelante arriva a somministrare al cadavere del litio ma l’umore del bambino nella bara è già sufficientemente stabilizzato .
Tutto questo è documentato tra gli altri da Peter Breggin , uno psichiatra che come potete immaginare non sta facendo una gran carriera nell ’American Psychiatric Association .
COLLATERAL – Tornando a noi tra gli psicofarmaci più divertenti che ho provato c’è senz ’ altro il bupropione che fa ridere già dal nome .
Questa sostanza viene usata anche per smettere di fumare conformemente al noto principio utilizzato in psicofarmacologia secondo il quale “ del maiale non si butta via niente ” , anche noto come serendipity .
Il buproprione ricalca quindi le gloriose orme della leggendaria imipramina che negli anni ’ 50 venne proposta la schizofrenia ma poi , così va il mondo , si rivelò utile per la depressione , e della clorpromazina che venne proposta come antitubercolare ma poi , così va il mondo , si rivelò utile per la schizofrenia ( pare per inciso che gli psichiatri avessero capito di aver fatto bingo dopo aver notato che i pazienti tubercolotici , pur non guariti , non rompevano più il cazzo ) .
Per completare il cerchio qualcuno ha proposto di utilizzare la malaria per lenire l’ansia , e l’inoculazione del virus dell ’aids per il contenimento del disturbo bipolare ma allo stato attuale delle ricerche non è lecito incoraggiare false speranze .
Il buproprione non mi ha fatto smettere di fumare , né ha migliorato la mia concentrazione ma ha avuto su di me i seguenti effetti che chiameremo , non senza un filo di ironia , “ collaterali ” .
Eighty - eight percent of the country 's top criminologists do not believe the death penalty acts as a deterrent to homicide , according to a new study published today in Northwestern University School of Law's Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology authored by Professor Michael Radelet , chair of the sociology department at the University of Colorado at Boulder , and Traci Lacock , an attorney and CU - Boulder graduate student in sociology .
The study titled " Do Executions Lower Homicide Rates ?
The Views of Leading Criminologists " undermines deterrence as a rationale for maintaining the punishment , said Radelet , one of the nation 's leading experts on the death penalty .
" These data show that deterrence , which in many circles is the strongest justification for the death penalty , falls on its face when closely examined by those who are best qualified to study and evaluate it , " Radelet said .
" Any justifications for the death penalty that might remain pale in comparison to drawbacks such as high costs , arbitrariness , executing the innocent and diverting resources from more effective ways to reduce crime and assist victims . "
The study was conducted by sending questionnaires to the most pre-eminent criminologists in the country , including fellows of the American Society of Criminology , winners of the American Society of Criminology 's prestigious Southerland Award and recent presidents of the American Society of Criminology .
The American Society of Criminology is the top professional organization of criminologists in the world .
The 77 respondents were not asked for their personal opinion about the wisdom of the death penalty , but instead to answer the questions only on the basis of their understandings of the empirical research available on the subject .
Eighty - seven percent of the expert criminologists also believed that abolition of the death penalty would not have any significant effect on murder rates , Radelet said .
And 75 percent of the respondents agreed that " debates about the death penalty distract Congress and state legislatures from focusing on real solutions to crime problems . "
" Our survey indicates that the vast majority of the world 's top criminologists believe that the empirical research has revealed the deterrence hypothesis for a myth , " Radelet and Lacock wrote .
" The consensus among criminologists is that the death penalty does not add any significant deterrent effect above that of long - term imprisonment . "

The Right really needs to choose its battles better .
Picking on socialized medical care when the U.S private system leaves literally millions of people without coverage is n't the smartest thing to do .
It is akin to the British criticizing the Italians about their food , or the Canadians insulting the U.S about baseball .

The Independent did an in depth report on health care in the U.S , and it uncovered some truly horrific facts ( h/t Cesca ) :
They came in their thousands , queuing through the
night to secure one of the coveted wristbands offering entry into a
strange parallel universe where medical care is a free and basic right
and not an expensive luxury .
Some of these Americans had walked miles
simply to have their blood pressure checked , some had slept in their
cars in the hope of getting an eye - test or a mammogram , others had
brought their children for immunisations that could end up saving their
life .
In the week that Britain 's National Health Service was held aloft by
Republicans as an " evil and Orwellian " example of everything that
is wrong with free healthcare , these extraordinary scenes in Inglewood ,
California yesterday provided a sobering reminder of exactly why President
Barack Obama is trying to reform the US system .
The LA Forum , the arena that once hosted sell - out Madonna concerts , has been
transformed – for eight days only – into a vast field hospital .
In America ,
the offer of free healthcare is so rare , that news of the magical medical
kingdom spread rapidly and long lines of prospective patients snaked around
the venue for the chance of getting everyday treatments that many British
people take for granted .

A ketogenic diet — also called a keto diet — is a very low carbohydrate diet designed to force your body to burn fat instead of glucose for energy .﻿﻿
Proponents of the diet claim that it is the most effective way to burn fat and achieve or maintain a lean body .
The diet is also used in medical settings .
But nutrition experts worry that this diet is too strict to be sustainable for many people .
Learn more about the advantages and disadvantages of a keto diet before you decide if it is right for you .
What Experts Say " The ketogenic diet severely limits carbohydrate to force the body to burn fat .
However , carbohydrates are limited so much on this diet that veggies and fruit are restricted , which experts agree limits fiber and nutrients .
Plus , restriction often promotes long - term weight gain . "
— Willow Jarosh , MS , RD
Background
The ketogenic diet has been in use in medical settings for about 100 years .
According to medical researchers , the diet was developed in the 1920s to mimic fasting diets that were used as early as 500 B.C to treat epilepsy﻿﻿ and other seizure disorders .
While it was used successfully to treat the disease for many years , interest in the diet diminished in the 1990s when anti-epileptic drugs ( AEDs ) were introduced .
However , the diet became popular again as certain forms of drug - resistant epilepsy and other pediatric epilepsy syndromes were identified .
The ketogenic diet was used successfully in many of these patients .
In recent years , the keto diet 's role in medicine has been expanded and program is also sometimes used to treat other conditions including headache , neurotrauma , Alzheimer disease , Parkinson disease , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) , cancer , stroke , mitochondrial disorders , brain trauma , psychiatric disorders , autism , and migraines .
Researchers are conducting studies to learn why the diet has a positive effect on some of these conditions .﻿﻿
But many published reports suggest the ketogenic diet helps to normalize atypical metabolisms which may cause the disorders .
The diet has also become popular in some athletic and weight loss communities .
People learned that medical patients who are put on the diet often lose weight — which led to the diet 's popularity as a quick method to slim down .
Some celebrities and professional athletes have promoted the diet as their preferred eating plan for weight loss , weight maintenance , and improved athletic performance .
The resulting media coverage has boosted the keto diet 's popularity even further .
How It Works
A ketogenic diet is one in which carbohydrate intake is severely restricted .
However , not all low - carbohydrate diets are ketogenic .
There are three approaches to low - carb eating and only one of them is considered a true keto diet .
On a ketogenic diet , your body goes into a state of ketosis , where it burns fat as fuel .
This process produces ketones , which gives these diets their " keto " name .
On most ketogenic diets , you consume 70 to 75 percent of your calories from fat .
Of the remainder , you consume about 5 to 10 percent of your calories from carbohydrate and the rest from protein .﻿﻿

However , there is some variation in the structure of the diet .
Some sources say to consume no more than 20 grams of carbohydrates per day , while others cite up to 50 grams , and many recommend no more than five percent of calories from carbs .
Meals are most often built around fat sources such as fatty fish , meat , nuts , cheese , and oils .
Some versions of the keto diet advise that you eat only certain types of fat .
For example , many authors advise steering clear of oils that are high in polyunsaturated omega - 6 fats ( soy , corn , cottonseed , safflower ) because they are considered to be less healthy .
Some versions of the diet recommend fats high in medium - chain triglycerides ( MCT ) , such as coconut oil and MCT oil as these fats are easily turned into ketones by the body .
In general , people on ketogenic diets tend to consume a lot of foods high in monounsaturated and saturated fats such as olive oil , butter ( from grass - fed cows is recommended ) , avocado , and cheeses .
The high oleic types of safflower and sunflower oils ( but not the regular forms of these oils ) are often recommended , as they are high in monounsaturated fats and low in polyunsaturated fats .
While there is no need to time meals , purchase specific products , or eat certain required snacks or beverages , the diet does not provide a lot of flexibility in terms of food choice because carbohydrates are so severely restricted .
Pros and Cons
Because there is a long history of use in the medical community , there is a wealth of research that explains and supports the mechanism of ketosis for the management of disease and ( to a lesser extent ) for weight loss .
Those who use the diet to lose weight are likely to see results quickly because eliminating foods high in carbs may reduce overall calorie intake and also reduces water weight .
However , while your body is adjusting to ketosis , there can be negative symptoms including fatigue , weakness , light - headedness , headaches , mild irritability .﻿﻿
Additionally , this way of eating eliminates or severely restricts foods high in fiber and other nutrients which can lead to health problems such as constipation and vitamin or mineral deficiencies .
Lastly , diets such as the ketogenic diet are often used only in the short - term because those without a medical condition may not be motivated enough to eliminate foods they love or are used to eating .
Highly restrictive diets have a tendency to backfire and can cause weight gain as a result .
Common Myths and Questions
Because the ketogenic diet has many variations — many of which are promoted in celebrity circles , fashion magazines , and online by fitness bloggers — there is some confusion about the eating style .
Question :
How will I know if my body is in ketosis ?
Most people on a ketogenic diet test for the presence of ketone bodies .
Ketone bodies — or ketones — are a byproduct of ketogensis and your body excretes them in your urine .﻿﻿
People commonly use urine sticks to see what their ketone levels are and if they are in ketosis .
It can take several days or several weeks to get your body into ketosis .
Question : Will I always be tired if I go on a ketogenic diet ?
No .
Most people adjust eventually as their bodies learn to burn fat as fuel .
However , you should expect some fatigue during ( at least ) the first week of the program .
Myth : Ketogenic diets are extremely dangerous and can even cause death .
Some people confuse ketosis with ketoacidosis .
Diabetic ketoacidosis is a dangerous condition affecting people who lack insulin and is primarily seen in type 1 diabetes or insulin - dependent type 2 diabetes .
In diabetic ketoacidosis , ketones levels are higher than in the ketosis produced by diet .
In an effort to clear up confusion about the two conditions , sometimes ketosis is referred to as " nutritional ketosis . "
Myth :
On a ketogenic diet , you can eat whatever fatty foods you want , such as bacon , cheese , French fries , and ice cream .
While it is true that a ketogenic diet includes primarily fatty foods , many foods that are high in fat are also high in carbohydrate .
For example , some types of cheese contain carbohydrate .
Also , foods such as ice cream and French fries are high in fat but they are also high in starch ( French fries ) and sugar ( ice cream ) .
So these foods would not be recommended in a keto diet plan .
Myth :
On a ketogenic diet , you eat a lot of meat .
Actually , keto diets include less meat than you might imagine .
Eating foods high in protein can offset the macronutrient balance required to reach and maintain ketosis .
For example , a hamburger patty is high in fat but higher in protein .
If you boost your protein intake , your body may burn protein as fuel instead of fat ( a process called gluconeogenesis ) .
Myth :
You can't be a vegetarian and go on a ketogenic diet .
While it is more difficult to be a vegetarian and go on a ketogenic diet , it is not impossible .
However , there are fewer plant sources of fat than there are dairy and meat sources of fat .
So your food variety will be limited .
Myth :
On a ketogenic diet , you do n't have to count calories .
Most ketogenic diets do n't require you to limit calories .
So while you do n't count calories per se , you do need to watch and calculate your macronutrient intake on a ketogenic diet , especially in the beginning of the program when you are trying to get your body into ketosis .
Macronutrients such as fat , carbohydrates , and protein are different types of calories .
How It Compares
If you 're considering the ketogenic diet , it can be helpful to evaluate how it compares to other diets used in medical , athletic , and weight loss settings .﻿﻿
Atkins
Allows for higher consumption of fat during Phase 1 of the program
Limits carbohydrate intake
Includes some keto - friendly foods in the food plan
Encourages higher consumption of low - glycemic carbohydrates in later phases of the diet
Low - carbohdyrate diets
All variations restrict carbohydrate intake , although generally not as much as the ketogenic diet .
Most low - carb diets recommend an intake of at least 20 - 30 percent of your calories from carbs — much higher than that of a keto diet .
Meals are often built around protein rather than fat .
Fat intake may be specifically restricted , but is generally not as high as it is on a ketogenic diet .
Scarsdale diet
This diet was also developed in a medical setting , popular in the 1970s , often compared to Atkins , and promised quick weight loss
The eating program was highly restrictive , limiting both calories and carbohydrates .
However , those who consumed this diet , ate more foods high in protein .
The Scarsdale diet is no longer as popular as it once was due in part to the criticism it received from nutrition experts .
The ketogenic diet varies substantially from nutritional guidelines provided by the USDA .
According to 2015 - 2020 Dietary Guidelines , adult men and women are advised to consume only 20 - 35 percent of calories from fat with an emphasis on healthy fat .
They advise that adults consume 45 - 65 percent of calories from carbohydrate and 10 - 35 percent of calories from protein .
Additionally , the USDA also provides a recommendation for dietary fiber ( approximately 23 - 33 grams per day ) .
Those on a ketogenic diet would have a difficult time reaching this goal since fiber is a carbohydrate .
Also , fruits and / or vegetables are recommended at every meal , a goal that would be hard to achieve on a ketogenic diet .
A Word From Verywell
The ketogenic diet is a helpful strategy for some people in the management of certain neurological conditions .﻿﻿
Some people have also found success with this eating style in their efforts to reach and maintain a lean , fit , body .
However , it is widely recognized as a difficult lifestyle to maintain , simply because the typical American diet is heavy in carbohydrate - rich foods .
If you want to try a ketogenic diet , be aware that you 'll have to adjust it for your individual metabolism and experiment with the right balance of carbs and calories .
You may want to consult a registered dietitian to build keto - friendly menus that will meet your nutritional needs .
Be sure to keep your health care provider informed when you start a new diet , especially if you have ongoing health conditions .

LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
The insurance business was very good to Reynaldo Hernandez .
Reynaldo Hernandez is a retired insurance agent who says rising medical costs are causing him pain .
" I loved the business because it rewarded you for your effort .
... I liked the fact that selling insurance was helping people avoid financial loss , " the California man says .
He sold insurance in the rural San Diego County town of Ramona for 35 years and retired eight years ago .
Since then , he has grown increasingly angry at the business he represented .
And the industry he gave so much to is about to ruin him financially .
" Over the years of my career , I saw the coverage get more expensive , but you got less , " says Hernandez .
In 2007 , Hernandez , 65 , and his wife Janet , 62 , spent more than $ 15,000 on insurance premiums .
Add a little more than $ 8,200 for co-payments and medicine , and Hernandez says they paid about $ 24 , 000 in medical costs that year .
" It took a huge chunk of our income .
... over 25 percent that year . "
So the man who sold insurance to so many people had to do without .
" I never thought , in my entire life , that I would ever get to the point that I , as an insurance agent , would ... have problems paying for medical insurance , " he says .
" Health insurance for me has been so important .
I would never dream of going without .
" Because we could no longer afford that kind of cost , we did the unthinkable .
We dropped our insurance , " says Hernandez .
Watch the family 's plight »
" It 's a little scary not to ... go to the doctor when you think ' I should have his checked , ' " says Janet Hernandez , Reynaldo 's wife of 43 years .
" I did n't have proper coverage to be able to go to the doctor and get checked .
Knowing that you could lose everything if something happened , that was scary . "
Janet Hernandez knows quite a bit about the insurance industry , too .
She worked with her husband as an agent for 10 years .
The Hernandezes now have medical insurance .
Reynaldo has Medicare , the federal insurance program for senior citizens .
But Janet is three years from qualifying for that program .
Until then , they have purchased a private policy to cover medical expenses .
But that policy is expensive .
" We pay about ... $ 850 a month on my insurance and co-pays on prescriptions and doctor visits , " says Janet .
" And still today , with ... higher deductibles every year ... still the cost keeps going up , up , up . "
" At the rate it is going up ...
I may not be able to keep her covered until she turns 65 , " adds Reynaldo .
Those added costs have put a pinch on their retirement .
Although retired , Reynaldo is still a licensed insurance agent .
" I 'm thinking about trying to go back to work full time so that I can maybe get a group plan to cover my wife , " he says .
" We had planned so many years for our retirement and to be able to do things , and travel , " says Janet . "
We 've cut way back on most of our expenses and we just do n't do the things we used to do because of the costs . "
" Every day I 'm looking at our checking account and our saving account and I 've become obsessed with it because I see that we do n't seem to have it under control , " says Reynaldo .
" And it 's very scary .
I should n't have to live in fear about our medical expenses . "
" I feel very nervous and uneasy about that , and I should n't be .
I should n't have to feel that way in my senior years .
I should be able to feel secure . "

Beginning tomorrow , September 1st , I will begin posting full technical details of cross -site scripting vulnerabilities that I have discovered in Facebook applications .
Following the model of the Month of Twitter Bugs , I will notify each application developer 24 hours prior to revealing any holes .
After 24 hours have passed , I will publish a new post on theharmonyguy.com with the title “ FAXX Hack : ” ( for Facebook Application XSS / XSRF ) and the name of the application .
I will also publish a corresponding update to my Twitter account with the hashtag # FAXX and a link to the post .
( Update ( 9/10 ) : I appreciate the input from several people regarding timing , and I ’ve changed my mind – I ’ll wait for patches before posting holes .
I certainly want to uphold ethical disclosures , and in hindsight the 24 - hour rule probably was n’t a good idea .
My bad , and once again I ’m grateful for other perspectives .
I am rather new to all this . )
At this time , I have found five widely used Facebook applications vulnerable to XSS .
I intend to look for more over the next few days , and I am open to submissions from others via theharmonyguy on Gmail .
I will give full credit for any new holes submitted .
Once I have posted all known XSS vulnerabilities in Facebook applications , I plan on releasing the full source code of XSS / CSRF demos I have created which demonstrate the ways a hacker can exploit such problems .
Let the games begin .
Okay … I think we can all relax .
I did n’t watch it the first few times I saw it linked , because I read the summary and it just sounded depressing .
Eventually I caved in and witnessed the nightmare for myself .
It really was hideous .
Yes , it ’s that video of the American girl sitting down for a chat with “ one regular [ friend ] and one Indian one ” , and getting caught up in an extended argument about whether she ’s African ( and , if not , why she ’s so dark ) before moving onto religion .
The Indian girl , Saraa , is a Hindu , and this fundamental difference in belief is handled with tact and sensitivity by her Christian pals , as they ask searching questions about this unfamiliar faith in order to better understand the worldview and experiences of someone they care about .
Questions like , “ Krishna ?
Is that what you call Jesus in your language ? ” and “ So… you want to go to Hell ? ”
For a couple of days now the whole internet has been finding it hilarious , in the same way as they might find a fatal traffic accident deeply engrossing .
All the obvious stuff has been said , about how worrying it is that someone could be so out of touch with what others think , and so unable to comprehend any alternative viewpoint .
And , of course , there was debate as to its authenticity .
I mostly bought it , at first .
They all do seem really sincere , and their geographical ignorance certainly plays into my expectations .
I was slightly suspicious of the neatness of the comic timing with which they cut away after the “ India , it ’s an African country in Asia ” line , but mostly it seemed depressingly genuine .
Looking at this girl ’s profile , she ’s also set up an account which seems to be solely for parodying their detractors , in a way which would seem to fit with their image as ignorant , self - absorbed teenagers .
She ’s favourited an Edward Current video , but she seems like exactly the sort of person who would entirely fail to spot the satire in his work , and be proudly declaring “ Checkmate , atheists ! ” whenever the chance arose .
But – unless I ’ve seriously misunderstood the way YouTube works – the slam - dunk evidence would seem to be in the tags she ’s attached to the video .
( I ’m assuming that they could only have been added deliberately by her when it was uploaded , and not come later from anywhere else . )
As people in the comments have pointed out , the tags of interest are “ poe ’s ” , “ law ” , “ Henry ” , and “ Fielding ” .
Poe ’s law describes how hard it is to create a parody of religious fundamentalism that wo n’t be taken seriously , because there are bound to be some fundamentalists who honestly believe even crazier stuff than whatever you can make up .
Henry Fielding was a famous 18th century satirist .
So … that has to clinch it , right ?
Until further analysis explains why I ’m wrong , I ’m going to assume they ’re joking .
It ’s not the most hilarious parody of Jesus - thumping lunacy I ’ve seen , largely because I suspect it ’s too accurate a re-creation .
The piss - taking is too subtle .
But I ’m sure I see it in there somewhere .
They were lampooning me .
It was a simple lampoon .
So , it ’s okay everyone .
We can all calm down and rest easy , safe in the knowledge that … well , the knowledge that there are thousands of people out there who really are exactly like this , but probably not the ones in this particular video .
I guess .
Yay ?
A MAN jumped into a fast - flowing river because he could n't take his wife 's nagging anymore .
The Chinese lorry driver , known as Zhou , and his wife were on a ferry on the Yangtze River when it all became too much for him , the Chongqing Evening Post reports .
Members of the ship 's crew saw the man suddenly run out of his cabin with his hands covering his ears , and shouting : " I ca n't stand it any longer . "
They initially thought he was suffering from an ear injury and went to help him but found he was unhurt .
" While we were still puzzling over the this , his wife ran up and continued nagging him , " said a crewmate .
" The husband covered his ears again and said : ' I need a break ' before jumping over the side into the rushing river .
" We immediately found lamps to light up the water but found nobody .
The possibility of survival can be zero . "
However , later that night , police found the man who had managed to swim about 2 km across across the broad river .
" I felt I was dying , but even that 's better than my wife 's nagging , " he reportedly told the police .
The couple were reunited the following morning at the local police station where Zhou 's wife promised to give up her habit of nagging him .

Direct action tactics in trying times .
From the July / August 2009 issue of Intersections , the newsletter of Common Action
Your boss wo n’t pay you for hours you worked .
The landlord wo n’t fix your backed - up toilet .
Your friend was detained by Immigration Customs Enforcement , and now she ’s facing deportation .
Who you gonna call ?
You might call a lawyer , or a social worker , or you might file an appeal that may or may not receive a reply .
But in an economy where these problems are becoming all too common , these solutions just are n’t cutting it anymore – they can be too slow , too expensive , and too isolating .
Instead , many groups are turning towards a different solution : direct action .
“ Direct action involves bringing people together to confront the person responsible for a problem , in order to demand a swift solution , ” explains Emily , a member of Seattle Solidarity Network ( SeaSol for short ) , an all - volunteer organization that supports workers and tenants .
Through fliers on telephone poles and bus stops , a website on the Internet , and good old fashioned word - of - mouth , SeaSol encourages people who have a a problem with a boss or landlord to contact the group for support .
Together , they write a demand letter and mobilize a crowd of people to deliver it to the boss or landlord ’s house or workplace .
If the boss or landlord fails to fix the problem by a stated deadline , SeaSol takes further collective action .
Using these tactics , SeaSol has enjoyed a string of victories : winning relocation assistance for tenants and , back pay for workers ; forcing employers to drop frivolous lawsuits ; and more .
While SeaSol focuses on workplace and housing concerns , many organizations around the world have applied a similar approach to a range of issues .
Ontario Coalition Against Poverty ( OCAP ) , a Canadian group widely recognized as one of the first to develop the direct action model , targets government assistance offices that illegally withhold support from people .
Another Canadian group , No One is Illegal , uses similar tactics on immigration and detention issues .
In British Columbia the group has occuped the offices of Canadian Border Services Agency ( CBSA ) and has prevented CBSA officers from carrying out deportation orders by blocking access .
In one instance , more than 1,500 people were mobilized to directly prevent the deportation of a Punjabi refugee at an airport .
“ Direct action is not always involved in our supportwork , and many migrants have been able to win residency without recourse to it , ” explains NOII member Usman Majeed .
“ However , when petitions , letters to politicians , press conferences , rallies , and legal avenues are all rejected by the state , we have little choice but to use our own bodies to protect and defend members of our community . ”
As times get tougher , many people are beginning to question the ability of social services and the legal system to effectively put an end to injustices committed by bosses , landlords and the government .
An important book called The Revolution Will Not Be Funded , edited by the group INCITE !
Women of Color Against Violence , calls this problem “ the Non-Profit Industrial Complex . ”
The book discusses how non-profit organizations ’ dependence paid staff and funding from the government or private foundations like the Rockefeller Foundation severely limits what they can accomplish .
By mobilizing groups of people rather than relying solely on experts , direct action groups build something that goes beyond solving individual grievances .
Direct action groups demonstrate that peoples ’ issues are n’t isolated , but represent a much larger system of disempowerment .
Over time , direct action organizations can help empower a community to stand up to this system .
As No One is Illegal states , “ it is imperative to concretely offer support to those at the front lines of repressive immigration policies and to build our communities ’ own capacity for resistance and self - organization . ”
Each fight is a learning experience for everyone involved , and as lessons are applied , communities win demands more and more often .
At a time when we stand to lose so much , we all benefit from the empowering effect of real victory .

Nine - year - olds can and should learn CPR .
A study of 147 schoolchildren , published in BioMed Central 's open access journal Critical Care , show that Nine - year - olds can and should learn CPR .
While the smallest may lack the requisite strength , the knowledge of how to perform basic life support is well retained by young children .
Fritz Sterz , from the Medical University of Vienna , Austria , led a team of researchers who studied children who had received six hours of life support training .
Upon examination four months after the training , 86 % performed CPR correctly .
Sterz said , " The usefulness of CPR training in schools has been questioned since young students may not have the physical and cognitive skills needed to perform such complex tasks correctly .
We found that , in fact , students as young as 9 years are able to successfully and effectively learn basic life support skills .
As in adults , physical strength may limit depth of chest compressions and ventilation volumes , but skill retention is good . "
The skills taught to the children included automatic defibrillator deployment , providing CPR , usage of the recovery position and calling for the emergency services .
For the critical skills of CPR and mouth - to - mouth resuscitation , BMI was the factor that had the biggest influence on depth of compressions and amount of air inhaled .
Age did not play a role , indicating that a well - built nine - year - old can be just as capable as an older child .
The researchers conclude , " Given the excellent performance by the students evaluated in this study , the data support the concept that CPR training can be taught and learnt by school children and that CPR education can be implemented effectively in primary schools at all levels .
Even if physical strength may limit CPR effectiveness , cognitive skills are not dependent on age , and with periodic retraining , children 's performance would likely improve over time . "

Did Mr Panetta admit to lawmakers that the CIA had misled Congress ?
CIA Director Leon Panetta has admitted that his agency regularly misled Congress , six members of the House Intelligence Committee have alleged .
The claims are echoed in a letter from the committee 's Democratic chairman , Sylvestre Reyes .
The allegations follow a claim by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that the CIA misled her about interrogation methods .
A CIA spokesman has insisted that " it is not the policy or practice of the CIA to mislead Congress " .
' Significantly lied to '
The six committee members , who are all Democrats , alleged in a letter to Mr Panetta that he " recently ... testified ... that top CIA officials have concealed significant actions from all Members of Congress and misled members for a number of years from 2001 to this week " .
" This is similar to other deceptions of which we are aware from other periods , " the letter states .
In a separate letter , Mr Reyes alleged that a " notification the Committee received [ from Mr Panetta ] on 24 June 2009 ... [ has ] led me to conclude that this Committee has been misled , has not been provided full and complete notifications and ( in at least one case ) was significantly lied to " .
The BBC's Jon Donnison in Washington says that in recent months there has been much debate over how much congressional leaders were told during the Bush administration about controversial CIA interrogation techniques such as water - boarding .
In particular , our correspondent says , Republicans have accused Mrs Pelosi , a Democrat , of lying about how much she knew about such methods .
Republicans say this latest accusation from Mr Reyes in being used as a distraction to shift attention away from Mrs Pelosi .
Mrs Pelosi insists that she was not told that the CIA had used water - boarding on prisoners , and that any suggestion by the CIA that she had been notified is untrue .
The row takes place as Democrats in Congress are attempting to push through new rules governing who is allowed to declassify secret information .
They want to give the chairmen of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees the power to open up classified information to the other members of their committees .
The proposal is being fiercely opposed by the Obama White House , which insists that only the president should have the power to declassify information .

When Apple announced the addition of a compass to the iPhone 3GS , shortsighted onlookers responded with a yawn .
Yay , we can find magnetic north .
But iPhone app developers quickly saw an opportunity , and a new breed of " augmented reality " apps are about to be born .
Holding the phone in front of you , locations are plotted on a live view of the world in relation to where you 're standing .
The apps combine the phone 's key features -- camera , GPS , compass and Internet connectivity -- to create a sort of heads - up display reminiscent of first - person shooter video games .
The first two poised to hit the App Store -- pending Apple 's approval , of course -- are Nearest Tube , which plots subway stations in London , and TwittARound , which shows nearby Twitter users .

Union official takes the helm at New York Federal Reserve
By Bill Van Auken
28 August 2009
This week ’s naming of New York State AFL - CIO President Denis Hughes as the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York speaks volumes about the evolution of the union bureaucracy in America .
Hughes is taking a post that was until recently occupied by Stephen Friedman , the former chairman of Goldman Sachs , who was compelled to resign in May over a conflict of interests scandal .
He was continuing to act as a director of the finance house and to buy stock in the company after it had been placed under regulation by the New York Fed .
Others who held the post before Friedman include the billionaire founder of the Blackstone Group private equity firm Peter Peterson and multi-millionaire New York real estate developer Jerry Speyer .
The state AFL - CIO chief will head a board that includes JP Morgan Chase head James Dimon and General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt .
Hughes will continue to hold the top post in the state AFL - CIO , where he was recently elected to a third four - year term .
The appointment provoked expressions of concern within the right - wing business press , where readers denounced the move as an indication of the grip of “ organized labor ” over the Obama administration .
The Wall Street Journal published a column that seemed aimed at reassuring its readership .
The piece began with the question , “ Is organized labor gaining power in the US , or are its leaders being co-opted by the federal government and corporate America ? ”
It noted that the naming of Hughes to head the New York Fed board was of a piece with other recent developments , including the United Auto Workers taking a seat on the General Motors board of directors and assuming an ownership share in the auto company , making profits realized through the exploitation of autoworkers a substantial source of income for this bureaucratic apparatus .
The Journal quoted Gary Chaison , professor of industrial relations at Clark University , who noted that there could be some concerns that Hughes would “ bring the union agenda to the Fed , and there will be questions about hedge fund profits and salaries . ”
Asked if such fears were warranted , Chaison replied , “ The union does n’t run the fed .
[ The appointment ] is more symbolic . ”
Indeed , Hughes will hold the post only until the end of this year , when a new chairman will be installed .
However , this still raises the obvious question : symbolic of what ?
On the surface , it would appear that the selection of Hughes represents an attempt by the Federal Reserve — and the Obama administration — to use the elevation of a union official to chairman of the New York bank ’s board to mask the essential role that it has played over the entire past period as the servant of Wall Street .
First it adopted monetary policies that facilitated the speculative bubbles that have produced the greatest crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s , and subsequently it has poured trillions of dollars in taxpayers ’ money into the banks and finance houses to save them from their bad bets .
All of this has been done at the expense of working people , the vast majority of the population , who have seen no similar effort to save their jobs , homes and living standards from an ever - mounting assault .
On a more fundamental level , however , it is symbolic of the transformation of the AFL - CIO , the UAW , the Teamsters and similar organizations into what are unions in name only , dedicated not to defending the working class , but to preserving the posts and privileges of a layer of right - wing functionaries , who in turn work to suppress working class struggles and uphold the interests of the banks , corporations and government .
Hughes is typical of this layer .
He came out of New York City ’s International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 3 , which was long headed by Harry Van Arsdale , a right - wing craft union bureaucrat who played a key role in quelling working class struggles in the city , where he headed the Central Labor Council for nearly three decades .
He gained national notoriety for working with investment bankers like Felix Rohytan to subordinate the labor movement to the bailout of New York City and Wall Street during the fiscal crisis of 1975 .
Hughes , along with his close friend and protégé Brian McLaughlin , was trained by Van Arsdale in the methods of business unionism in an organization that made scant distinction between the interests of electrical contractors and the rank - and - file workers they employ .
Appointed to the state AFL - CIO , Hughes rose through the hierarchy , acting as head of its political action arm , which served to subordinate workers to the Democratic Party .
For his part , McLaughlin recently began serving a 10 - year prison sentence after being convicted of over $ 3 million worth of kickbacks from electrical contractors , misappropriation of state funds and embezzlement from the New York City Central Labor Council , where he succeeded Van Arsdale ’s son Thomas as president .
Hughes chaired the CLC board during McClaughlin ’s graft spree .
Moreover , Hughes has a proven track record at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , the most important of the Federal Reserve regional banks , where monetary policy is most directly implemented .
He has held a seat on the board since 2004 and has served as its acting chairman since Friedman of Goldman Sachs resigned in May .
During all of that time , there is no record of Hughes objecting to the adoption of policies designed to facilitate the vast enrichment of the financial elite during the Wall Street boom , and then to bail out the finance houses after the collapse of this boom little over a year ago .
This seamless collaboration between the head of the New York State AFL - CIO and elements like Peter Peterson , James Dimon and Jeffrey Immelt on the Fed Bank ’s board is merely the culmination of decades of betrayals carried out by the union bureaucracy , the suppression of strikes and the surrendering of past conquests of the workers movement , all of which were essential to the concentration of wealth and growth of social inequality that are fundamental characteristics of the present social order in the US .
That a leading AFL - CIO bureaucrat is the titular head of a board overseeing a monetary policy that is bailing out multi-millionaires and billionaires at the expense of hundreds of millions of working people is only one more confirmation that the coming eruption of class struggle in America must take the form of a rebellion against these reactionary pro-corporate bureaucracies and the building of new organizations dedicated to mobilizing the working class against capitalism .

A long jump of 6.29 metres also helped steady any early second - day nerves .
It might have been slightly down on her personal best but it was still a good enough effort for someone who had to go back to the drawing board in the winter and switch her take - off from her right to her left foot to reduce future wear and tear on her injured foot .
Usain Bolt yucked it up for the television cameras and then turned on his game face , shattering his own world record in the men's 100 metres in a time of 9.58 seconds at the world track and field championships in Berlin on Sunday .
Running full - out in ideal conditions and against the toughest competition possible for the first time in his 22 years , Bolt blew away his own world record — set last summer at the Beijing Olympics — by a massive .11 seconds and made rival Tyson Gay seem like a laggard despite setting a U.S. record of 9.71 seconds .
" I was ready to execute and I did just that , " Bolt told CBC Sports .
" I was happy with myself . "
It was the biggest improvement in the record since electronic time was introduced in 1968 .
Racing before a crowd of 55,000 , Bolt glanced quickly to his right at 90 metres to check on Gay , then left , at the Olympic Stadium scoreboard , as he crossed the line and then pounded his chest when he saw the record time displayed .
" For me it was all about going out there to win , " Bolt said .
" I knew Tyson was running well all season .
I got a good start and I took it from there . "
" When I got to 50 metres I knew it was going to be tough for Tyson because that is the best part of my race . "
Despite his astonishing new mark , Bolt believes he can run even faster .
" For me anything is possible , " he said .
" I 'm just going to keep doing my best and hopefully I can keep doing great things , and keep on breaking records . "
Gay , last year 's world champion , has been hampered by a nagging groin injury of late .
He arrived in Berlin with the season 's top time of 9.77 at the Golden Gala track and field meet in Rome .
" I put everything into it .
But I came in second , " Gay said .
" I can definitely run faster . "
Bolt 's countryman Asafa Powell was third in a time of 9.84 , his best performance of 2009 .
After the race , Bolt grabbed a flag , hugged Powell , with whom he had been literally shadowboxing for fun just before the start .
They wrapped themselves in the Jamaican flag and it looked like the Bird 's Nest in Beijing all over again .
Daniel Bailey of Antigua and Barbuda and Richard Thompson of Trinidad and Tobago tied for fourth at 9.93 .
The win was the second straight for Bolt over Gay , who has n't tasted victory against Bolt since the 200 - metre final at the 2007 worlds in Osaka , Japan .
In May 2008 , Bolt blew away Gay ( 9.72 to 9.85 ) in New York on a rainy night at the Reebok Grand Prix .
Bolt flirted with disaster in the semifinal earlier Sunday by false - starting .
Facing elimination if he did it again , Bolt had time to eye the stadium clock and his opponents as he slowed across the line in 9.89 seconds .
" I do my worrying outside of the competition , " said Bolt .
" I was worried during the season because it was up and down , but coming into the [ world ] championships , I knew I was ready so there was no worries . "
Gay signalled his groin was still giving him trouble after his semifinal heat , but he forced Bolt to run the race of his life less than three hours later .
Gay stayed with him over the first part but once Bolt unfurled his huge stride , there was no contest .
Jamaica rules women's 100
Ahead of that race , the Jamaican and American women got their own sprint rivalry going earlier Sunday .
Kerron Stewart ran 10.92 in the 100 for the best time , leading a Jamaican team effort that placed three of their runners in the top four .
Carmelita Jeter of the United States was the only one able to split the trio , running 10.94 for second place .
The final is set for Monday .
Overall , Jamaica won five of six sprint titles at the Beijing Olympics and left the U.S. team without a single gold .
Now , the Americans want to become the top nation again .
With most people centred on the sprints , Russia became the first nation with double gold when Olympic champion Olga Kaniskina won the women 's 20 - kilometre walk , defending her world championship title from two years ago .
With the javelin and 800 left in the heptathlon , Jessica Ennis was firmly in the lead .
The Briton managed only the ninth - best long jump result but was able to maintain her overall lead in the seven - discipline competition .
With a jump of 6.29 metres , Ennis amassed a total of 5,064 points after five events .
*** Update ***: I made an error with the original posting .
No band opted out of the festival ; only sponsors did .
The posting now reflects that .
Sorry for any confusion
…
The Charlotte Pop Fest ’09 took place this weekend — it ’s a music festival that featured the likes of The Smithereens , Jill Sobule , and several bands / singers I ’ve never heard of .
But I ’m interested because all the proceeds from the event went to a great cause :
This year Charlotte Pop Fest will celebrate the life of Charles Darwin and all proceeds from the event will benefit the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason & Science .
The year 2009 is the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin ’s birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of his book The Origin of Species .
The organizer , James Deem , said he just wanted to raise awareness for science education .
“ It ’s just really important , ” Deem said .
“ There ’s not that many people raising money for science . ”
But , of course , some people are offended by the prospect of science education and the idea that their personal sacred cows are challenged at RDFRS .
Deem says he ’s lost a sponsor because of the event ’s support of the Richard Dawkins Foundation and the money he lost forced him to cancel appearances by a couple of the bands .
…
Thorne stressed that the bands are there to play music , not give out a message about atheism or anything else .
Pop Festival attendee Debbie Aintrazi of Mint Hill hopes they do n’t .
“ If they start going around saying , ‘ no , you should n’t believe in this , you should n’t believe in that ’ — that ’s when I [ get upset ] , ” she said .
“ I do n’t believe in not believing . ”
Of course , no one at the festival is telling people to stop having faith .
And even the Dawkins Foundation was n’t formed to convert people .
Even if Dawkins would like to do that , that ’s not the purpose of the Foundation .
The Foundation wants current atheists to go public about it , and they want people to think for themselves instead of blindly accepting whatever some person in a church tells them to believe .
The Foundation preaches education , not atheism .
But if the former leads to the latter , so be it .
That ’s just a pleasant byproduct .
This is the press release issued by Deem :
It is with great regret that I have to announce that Roger Joseph Manning Jr. and Linus of Hollywood will not be performing at Charlotte Pop Fest this year .
A couple of weeks ago a sponsor , that had originally committed to supporting the event financially , abruptly decided they did n’t want to be associated with the Richard Dawkins Foundation …
The sponsors refused to give money because part of it was going toward science education and it ’s namesake is a man who challenges people to question their beliefs .
Very disappointing .
Maybe this is just wild conjecture here -- and we all know how much everyone loves opinions in Serious Journalism -- but is n't Barack Obama 's birthday cake hideously ugly ?
This is not at all in line with Obama 's sleek , skinny - tie persona , and frankly , we 're shocked .
It looks like the Cake Boss 's disgruntled ex karate - chopped the frosting bag .
Decorated with the presidential seal , the layer cake was accompanied by various pies , including pecan , huckleberry , Key lime and coconut cream , plus a cheesecake .
How'd this happen ?
Michelle wears $ 540 Lanvin sneakers to plant organic veggies in the White House garden .
The girls switch outfits aboard Air Force One to arrive in Paris in crisp khaki trench coats .
Sure , Barack did have that one little slip up with the mom jeans , but we 're ready to move past that .
This is not a family that courts cavities via swirls of Harris Teeter grocery store icing and fondant seals propped up against the edge of frosted daisies and blue garlands .
The Obamas should be celebrating with Baked & Wired cupcakes topped high with icing and those little silver balls that look really cool but kinda hurt everyone 's teeth nonetheless .
And then there 's the " 44 . "
We all know he 's the 44th president , but come on , it 's his 48th birthday .
Are we celebrating his birthday , or celebrating that he 's president ?
Wait , do n't answer that .
Michelle , Malia and Sasha , plus more than 30 staffers , sang " Happy Birthday " to the president at a celebration in the Roosevelt Room .
Now , hush up , birthers , or you 're not getting any cake .

About one in six consumers have at some time acted on a spam message , affirming the economic incentive for spammers to keep churning out millions of obnoxious pitches per day , according to a new survey .
Due to be released Wednesday , the survey was sponsored by the Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group ( MAAWG ) , an industrywide security think tank composed of service providers and network operators dedicated to fighting spam and malicious software .
Eight hundred consumers in the U.S. and Canada were asked about their computer security practices habits as well as awareness of current security issues .
Those who did admit to opening a spam message -- which in and of itself could potentially harm their computer -- said they were interested in a product or service or wanted to see what would happen when they opened it .
" It is this level of response that makes spamming a lot more attractive as a business because spam is much more likely to generate revenues at this response rate , " according to the survey .
One other study , conducted by the computer science departments of the University of California at its Berkeley and San Diego campuses , showed the number people who actually made a purchase following a spam pitch was just a fraction of a percent .
Those researchers infiltrated the Storm botnet , a network of hacked computers used to send spam .
They monitored three spam campaigns , in which more than 469 million e-mails were sent .
Of the 350 million messages pitching pharmaceuticals , 10,522 users visited the advertised site , but only 28 people tried to make a purchase , a response rate of .0000081 percent .
Still , that rate is high enough to potentially generate up to US $ 3.5 million in annual revenue , they concluded .
MAAWG 's survey showed that nearly two - thirds of the 800 polled felt they were somewhat experienced in Internet security , a highly complex field even for those trained in it , said Michael O'Reirdan , chairman of MAAWG 's board of directors .
And some 80 percent of people felt their machine would never be infected with a bot , or a piece of malicious software that can send spam , harvest data and do other harmful functions .
That 's dangerous , O'Reirdan said .
" If you do n't believe you are n't going to get one , you are n't going to look for one , " he said .
" If you get a bot , you 're a nuisance to other people . "
Interestingly , 63 percent of consumers said they would allow remote access to their computer to remove malware .
That idea is under increasing discussion in the security community , which is grappling with how to deal with botnets .
Botnets can also conduct denial - of - service attacks against Web sites , such as the ones attacked last week in South Korea and the U.S .
Some ISPs are building automated systems that can cut off a computer 's Internet access if the machine is suspected of containing malware .
Consumers are then given instructions on how to patch their machine and install security software .
When their PC is clean , they are restored full access to the Internet .
MAAWG is close to issuing a set of guidelines for ISPs on how to battle botnets .
" The best thing a user can do is patch their machine religiously , " O'Reirdan said .
" It 's incredible easy to do . "
Coming off the accidental misprint of £ 17 , Gran Turismo 5 has surged to number one on the Amazon UK Videogame Charts .
Yes , Sony ’s racing behemoth managed to trump long - standing champions , the Wii and Wii Fit ; both of which have spent 3 years and 1 year in the top 100 , respectively .
This comes just one day after England nearly sank with the excitement of when Amazon UK accidentally set the price of Gran Turismo 5 at a measly 17 pounds .
With today ’s exchange rates , that comes out to around $ 28 .
Amazon , however , quickly saw fit to change the price back to the recommended 38 pounds .
Gladney ’s Lawyer : He ’s Unemployed , Insured and Making Money From the Alleged Attack
Created : August 10 , 2009 15:44 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
I just got off the phone with David Brian Brown , the St. Louis , Mo. , lawyer who has appeared with Kenneth Gladney , the black man who claims he was beaten up by a bunch of Service Employees International Union members outside a town hall meeting in St. Louis .
Gladney says he was just there innocently selling Gadsden flags — those flags with the coiled snake that say “ Do n’t Tread On Me ” and became symbols of the recent GOP Tea Party protests .
Here ’s the video that shows the alleged attack — and Gladney ( the one in the grey polo shirt ) walking around casually after the incident , claiming that an SEIU member attacked him .
Meanwhile , as Daily Kos diarist KevinNYC points out in his play - by - play of the event , there ’s a big white guy in a white polo shirt yelling — “ they attacked him ! ”
The guy on the video looks strikingly like his lawyer , David Brown , who now says he was a witness to the event , so he ca n’t officially represent Gladney .
When I asked Brown , who was in a car with Gladney on their way to see Brown ’s brother , who is going to be Gladney ’s official lawyer , Brown said that there ’s been lots of misinformation floating around online about this case .
For one , Brown said , contrary to recent reports like this one from the St. Louis Post - Dispatch , Gladney was n’t laid off and has health insurance .
“ He ’s just unemployed , ” says Brown , and “ has insurance through his wife . ”
Although Brown initially identified Gladney as “ a friend , ” when I asked him what line of work Gladney is in , he had to go ask Gladney about that before he could report back to me that about a year ago , Gladney worked for an optical store .
Brown said he thinks Gladney ’s wife is a social worker , but he ’s really not sure .
Meanwhile , though Gladney appears to be just fine in the video right after he was supposedly beaten up , he showed up the next day at a tea party event in a wheelchair .
At the event , Bill Hennessy , the organizer of the St. Louis tea parties , asked the crowd to donate money to Gladney to help him pay for his injuries , despite the fact that he now says he has insurance .
When I asked Brown about this , he said : “ Well , who does n’t need a donation ?
If people want to give him a donation because he ’s injured and unemployed , that ’s up to them . ”
Brown said Gladney has raised about $ 1,100 in donations so far .
Brown also told me that Gladney is not a conservative activist .
He was just selling the 18th - century patriotic resistance flags to try to make some extra money .
Brown said Gladney plans to sue both the individuals he says attacked him and the SEIU , since the “ attackers ” were wearing union T - shirts and “ unions have a 100 - year history of intimidation . ”
On the Fox News Channel ’s “ Your World with Neil Cavuto ” on Friday , Gladney said he ’s “ in some pain ” but “ I ’m okay , I ’m still kind of shaken up , just kind of upset about the whole thing . ”
Brown said he does n’t yet have the medical report of his client ’s alleged injuries , but that his lawyer brother , Andrew Beeny , will be getting a copy for the lawsuit .
Brown said he did n’t know whether his brother would release the report to the public .

The Attorney General , shockingly on the verge of " making charging decisions " with respect to Bank of America and its executives , sent an angry letter to Cleary Gottlieb , legal advisors for " TARP For Life " club member Bank Of America , demanding that Ken Lewis and other executives who may face some serious fines and or jailtime , stop hiding behind a client - attorney privilege which is preventing his office ( and in a separate matter , that of Jed Rakoff ) from making decisions on the matter of how much material information was hidden or misrepresented in the Merrill Acquisition , and present all the critically needed information .
Either way , now that Cuomo is on the verge of actually charging someone with criminal misdeeds , the only question remains who : will it be Bank Of America , with the likely fall guy being big man Lewis himself ( and what more fitting end to the debacle than Ken going to jail , after being threatened by Paulson and Bernanke with eternal damnation , and deciding not to invoke the Mac clause ) , or , will it be Wachtell Lipton 's main lawyer , Ed Herlihy , who , as we discussed previously , was instrumental in the arrangement of the ML - BAC transaction .
Bank Of America now has four business days in which to decide , based on its disclosures , who is going to be charged and with what crime .
In the meantime , Rakoff must be also quite interested in this outcome .
In that separate case , Bank Of America has until tomorrow , September 9 , to come back to the judge with the additional information he has requested along the same lines .
The next few days could end up being very interesting for Ken Lewis .

BURLINGTON , Vt. -
The head of a Canada - based group suspected of smuggling more than 100 illegal aliens into the country , mostly through Vermont , has pleaded innocent to a five - count indictment .
Fifty - six - year - old Jose Manuel Galdamez - Serrano pleaded innocent Monday to allegations he oversaw an illegal - immigrant smuggling business from 2004 and 2007 .
His son , 27 - year - old Emmanuel Antonio Galdamez , pleaded innocent to similar charges .
The Burlington Free Press reported that the father and son are citizens of Canada and their native El Salvador .
They were originally indicted on the smuggling charges in 2007 and have fighting extradition to Vermont .
This was their first court U.S. court appearance .
Court papers said the operation charged people interested in entering the country illegally " money in the $ 1,000s " to get them across the border .
The illegal immigrants hailed from India , Pakistan and Central and South America .

We ca n’t expect much from the oil industry , but Greenpeace ’s newest finding is as ugly as it gets .
As if $ 82 million in lobbying so far this year is n’t enough , the oil industry decided to fake public concern and challenge the upcoming climate bill further than they already are through really dishonest means recently .
Greenpeace received a leaked memo from the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) last week urging members to have their employees pretend to be typical citizens concerned about energy and the upcoming climate bill .
Greenpeace helped by leaking the memo and laying Astroturf outside the API headquarters in D.C. ( the fake grassroots activism the API was engaging in is known as “ astroturfing ” ) .
The Astroturf had the logos of ExxonMobil , Shell , BP and Chevron on it , some of the biggest oil players who are involved in the scandalous institute .
The memo from the API President that Greenpeace leaked told the CEOs of major companies ( i.e. ExxonMobil , Shell , BP and Chevron ) to “ indicate to your company leadership – your strong support for employee participation in the rallies ” and to treat the memo as “ secretive ” because “ we do n’t want our critics to know our game plan . ”
Unfortunately for Big Oil , but fortunate for the American public , many of the API ’s members have actually expressed support for “ cap and trade ” climate legislation and someone leaked the memo .
Greenpeace states that the API was also citing economic statistics in a misleading way and the “ scam makes a mockery of the public debate on climate action . ”
Greenpeace righteously states : “ Government climate and energy policy must be based on climate science and the genuine expression of public opinion ” .

You may remember more than your conscious brain knows , according to a nifty new study that will soon be published in the journal Neuron .
Researchers gave college students memory tests while closely monitoring both their eye movements and their brain activity , and found that certain patterns revealed that a student was retrieving the memory of the right answer -- although his conscious brain often never got it .
In the experiment , researchers presented a long sequence of pictures of faces paired with an outdoor scene , and finally showed the subject one landscape photo along with three faces , asking him to pick out the face that had originally be paired with the landscape .
Immediately , activity in the brain region called
the hippocampus increased , followed 500 to 750 milliseconds later by eye movements directed toward one of the three faces .
When the hippocampus was more active , the eyes lingered on the correct face .
Less hippocampus activity occurred when the eyes dwelled on an incorrect face ....
The results suggest that eye movements can reveal unconscious memories activated in the hippocampus [ Science News ] .
This pattern stayed the same regardless of whether the subject ultimately settled on the right answer .
The hippocampus plays a crucial role in learning and memory , but one theory of neuroscience suggested that the region only works on conscious memories , like recalling an event or someone 's name .
People like H.M. , a world - famous neuroscience patient with a damaged hippocampus , can't form new conscious memories but can learn new skills , like riding a bike
— leading to the belief that an intact hippocampus is not needed for unconscious recall .
But the new study suggests that the hippocampus actually is involved in memories of relationships that a person does not consciously recollect [ Science News ] .

I 'm not a fan of picking apart records like this .
You can go through any fighter 's record and start discrediting wins , and it 's really not fair to great fighters to go back and nitpick records .
Penn earned himself a number of enemies with his behavior after UFC 94 , and those enemies want to discredit everything he 's done in MMA .
I 'm sure if Penn beats Florian his detractors will claim Florian was never that good anyway , but a win over Florian effectively secures his spot as the best lightweight in the world .
This wo n't be an easy fight for Penn .
He has better boxing , wrestling , and jiu - jitsu than Florian , but Florian has better cardio and a number of weapons from range he can use to effectively nullify Penn 's advantages .
Florian has become an evasive counter striker on his feet ; I expect him to make BJ chase him and try to catch BJ with body kicks when he closes in .
The key for Penn in this fight is to resist the urge to fight standing and get Florian down .
Penn 's offensive wrestling is underrated ; he definitely has the ability to put Florian on his back , and that 's where Penn can really do a lot of damage .
From my perspective , Penn 's legacy in the sport is secure .
But a loss to Florian at this point will give a lot of ammunition to those who have long believed he has never lived up to the hype .
PRINCETON , NJ -- A mid-July USA Today / Gallup survey finds 47 % of Americans calling themselves " pro-life " and 46 % " pro-choice . "
This is less positive for the " pro-life " position than was true in a Gallup survey in May .
However , both 2009 readings show more Americans labeling themselves " pro-life " than has been the case in recent years .
The average figures for Americans ' preferred abortion label across 18 Gallup surveys conducted from 1995 to 2008 are 49 % for the " pro-choice " position and 42 % for the " pro-life " position -- a seven - point advantage for the " pro-choice " side .
Both of Gallup 's 2009 surveys show more Americans identifying as " pro-life " than as " pro-choice " ( although the one - point advantage for " pro-life " in the July 2009 survey is not statistically significant . )
The May 7 - 10 , 2009 , Gallup survey found a significantly higher percentage of Americans identifying themselves as " pro-life " than " pro-choice , " 51 % vs. 42 % .
( A similar result was found in Gallup Poll Daily tracking from May 12 - 13 . )
Those surveys were conducted in the wake of considerable news coverage over the University of Notre Dame 's decision to invite President Barack Obama to deliver the 2009 commencement address , an event that may have raised Americans ' awareness of Obama 's pro-choice views .
The current poll , conducted just over a month after abortion doctor George Tiller was killed by an anti-abortion activist , finds a nearly even split between the two sentiments .
On a long - term basis , both 2009 measures , although differing slightly from one another , indicate a modest shift toward the " pro-life " position .
The current parity among the U.S. public between the " pro-choice " and " pro-life " camps is mirrored in a separate Gallup question asking Americans whether abortion should be legal in all circumstances , legal only under certain circumstances , or illegal in all circumstances .
In Gallup 's May and July 2009 surveys , the percentages favoring one of the two extreme positions are about equal .
Currently , 21 % say abortion should be legal without exceptions while 18 % say it should be illegal .
Apart from several readings between 2002 and 2005 when the two sides were closely matched , a significantly higher percentage of Americans has typically favored unfettered abortion rights than no legal access to abortion , peaking at a 20 - point difference in September 1994 , 33 % vs. 13 % .
From 1988 through 2008 , the average advantage for the " legal under any circumstances " position was 12 percentage points , 28 % vs. 16 % .
That compares with a three - point advantage today .
Republicans Remain More " Pro- Life " Compared to Earlier in Decade
As was the case in May , the increase in " pro-life " sentiment in the current survey is the result of a higher percentage of Republicans ( including independents who lean Republican ) identifying themselves as such .
Today , two - thirds of Republicans call themselves " pro-life , " up roughly 10 points from earlier this decade .
As seen in May , there has been no change in the outlook of Democrats on the issue , who generally favor the " pro-choice " position by 2 to 1 .
Bottom Line
Americans ' attitudes on abortion have varied over the past two decades , but the balance of opinion has consistently favored the abortion rights side -- ranging from a slight advantage to a significant advantage .
Advocacy of abortion rights , as measured in Gallup polling , was particularly high from about 1989 to 1996 , and continued to be the dominant position into 2001 .
It subsequently dwindled some through about 2005 , then expanded again from 2006 through 2008 .
In 2009 , the ratio of Americans identifying themselves as " pro-choice " versus " pro-life " and the percentage saying abortion should be legal " under any circumstances " are at or near the lowest levels seen in Gallup trends .
The source of the latest shift in abortion views -- between 2008 and 2009 -- is clear .
The percentage of Republicans ( including independents who lean Republican ) who call themselves " pro-life " has risen by nearly 10 points over the past year , from 60 % to 68 % -- perhaps a reaction to the " pro-choice " presidency of Barack Obama -- while there has been essentially no change in the views of Democrats and Democratic leaners .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,006 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted July 17 - 19 , 2009 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

A union boss ripped up a copy of The Sun with " Labour 's Lost it " on its front page as he addressed the Labour conference in Brighton .
Tony Woodley , leader of Unite , won rousing cheers when he tore up the paper .
He said : " I suggest the rest of the country should do exactly the same thing " .
( CNN ) --
He has been caught on camera firing a tranquilizer dart into a Siberian tiger and has co-piloted a fighter jet .
Now Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has added to his action - man credentials with a series of photographs showing a recent adventure vacation to Siberia .
Among the officially - released pictures , the former president and judo master is seen riding topless on horseback , breaking firewood with his knee , driving a speedboat and swimming in a river .
For Putin , who will be 57 in October , the vacation comes just days after he took a diving trip to the bottom of the world 's deepest lake , Lake Baikal , in a military submarine .
The cost of air travel must rise to an extent that it deters people from flying and to compensate developing countries for the damage it does to the environment , according to the government 's advisory body on climate change .
Ticket prices should rise to ensure that carbon dioxide emissions from aviation fall back to 2005 levels and to raise tens of billions of pounds in flight taxes to help developing nations adapt to climate change , for example , by building new flood defences , the committee on climate change says .
An agreement to cap aviation emissions must be reached at the UN climate talks in Copenhagen if countries are to meet targets to combat global warming , the committee said in a letter to ministers .
Rich countries should take the lead , ensuring their aviation emissions were no higher or lower than they were in 2005 by 2050 .
It says airlines should be forced to share the burden of meeting that emissions cut , the Times reports .
In advance of the December meeting in Denmark , the committee says any deal to reduce emissions from flying should be " ambitious " , and the aim should be for no less than the EU 's current plan , which require a 5 % reduction in emissions from 2013 to 2020 .
The committee could challenge the government 's decision to approve a third runway at Heathrow airport in order to reduce C02 emissions sufficiently to meet that target , according to the paper .
While the cost per passenger of compensating developing countries for climate change would initially be small , it would eventually rise to a level that would deter people from flying .
The average passenger would pay under £ 10 extra per return ticket when aviation joins the European Union C0 2 emissions trading scheme in 2012 , the Times says .
The scheme will give airlines free carbon permits covering 85 % of their emissions but they will have to buy permits for the remaining 15 % .
The committee on climate change says airlines should have to pay for all their emissions , which would more than double the cost to passengers .
Writing to Lord Adonis , the transport secretary and Ed Miliband , the climate change secretary , the committee 's chief executive , David Kennedy , said the measures would not force people to fly less .
" It is vital that an agreement capping global aviation emissions is part of a Copenhagen deal , " he said .
" We are calling for a cap that would not require people to fly less than today , but would constrain aviation emissions growth going forward , " he said .
" Such a cap together with deep emissions cuts in other sectors would limit the risk of dangerous climate change and the very damaging consequences for people here and in other countries that this would have . "
Without steps to stop growth in aviation emissions , planes could account for as much as a fifth of all CO 2 produced worldwide by 2050 , the committee warned .
The BBC reports that if aviation fails to reduce its C0 2 emissions the rest of the economy may have to make deeper cuts of 90 % by 2050 - 10 % more than currently planned .
The committee said it supported plans to include flying in the EU - wide emissions trading scheme , which would give the aviation industry some carbon credits to cover some of its output and let them purchase allowances from greener companies to make up the shortfall .
But in the long term real cuts must be made , rather than rich countries relying on offsetting their emissions by purchasing credits from poorer countries under international trading schemes .
A government spokesman said : " The UK now has the toughest climate change regime for aviation of any country in the world and we will bring international pressure for aviation emissions to be part of global deal on climate change at the Copenhagen conference later this year . "
A Greenpeace climate change campaigner , Vicky Wyatt , said any government would find it " almost impossible " to build a third runway at Heathrow if they followed the committee 's advice .

The speculation began after the U.K. newspaper News of the World reported Sunday that the couple had finally come to " an understanding that their eight - year relationship will end in marriage .
It is no longer a question of if , but when . "
Buckingham Palace 's strategy is for the couple to be married before William 's grandmother , Queen Elizabeth , celebrates her diamond jubilee in 2012 , marking 60 years on the throne , the paper said .
That gives Middleton , who has been described as shy and retiring , and not used to dealing with the media , three years to learn the royal ropes , according to the newspaper .
A spokesperson for Clarence House , which is the residence of Prince Charles and his sons , William and Harry , told CBC Tuesday that the story was false , but offered no further comment .
Apparently , the pressure on William to pop the question started last Friday when he and Middleton attended the wedding of Guards officer Nick van Cutsem , who quipped to the couple : " You 're next ! " as he and his bride left the church .
William and Middleton , both 27 , have dated off and on since meeting in 2001 at the University of St Andrew in Scotland , where they were both students .
Middleton has received an invitation from the Queen to join the royals on vacation at Balmoral this summer , so she appears to have the family stamp of approval .
Objectified
I took two of my sons to see the new documentary on industrial design : Objectified .
( Yes , that would be a big night out for the Pieris . )
It was created by Gary Hustwit , who also created a scintillating ( I am dead serious ) film on type design , called Helvetica .
You do n’t have to be design geeks , like me and my sons , to enjoy these films .
I like the arc of Objectified .
At first I was worried because Hustwit starts with a well - done but pretty obvious primer on the basic process of industrial design ( interviews with Dieter Rams of Braun , the Smart design folks who do all the OXO stuff , Bill Moggridge who created the field of interaction design ) .
But it is a thoughtful base upon which to layer some of the more philosophical questions of consumerism , sustainability and policy making which are a big part of the design profession these days .
Anyway , you should go see it , or put it in your Netflix queue , if you care at all about design .
Take your kids ( over age 10 ) –they ’ll get it .
We are surrounded by this manufactured stuff , but most of us do n’t think enough about products and their meaning in our life and living environments .
Here are some thoughts I enjoyed :
From Jonathan
Ive ( central designer at Apple , since a very long time ) :
One of the curses of being a designer is we ca n’t look at anything without thinking , ‘ Why is it like that , and not like this . ’
In that way , we are constantly designing .
From Gary Hustwit :
We have an ongoing conversation with designers through the objects they create .
From Rob Walker , NYT writer :
At the end of the day , if you thought a hurricane was about to hit your house in 20 minutes , what would you grab ?
You would n’t take something because it had a good review in a design blog .
You would take the objects that reflect the true story of you .
The ones that tell your true narrative , because you are the only audience that matters
That comment really delighted me because one of our early Grommets was a book called Taking Things Seriously .
It ’s full of exactly that kind of personal narrative , as told through treasured objects .
It was very inspirational to me in creating Daily Grommet .
From my 17 - year - old son Gray , upon seeing the director Gary Hustwit take the stage ,
He looks normal .
From my design student son Dane , upon spotting a gray - haired pony - tailed man in black designerly garb ,
That ’s Matthew Carter who designed the typeface Verdana .
He was in Helvetica .
From me , rather cattily , after hearing a senior representative of the prominent design firm IDEO give one vapid answer after another ( She shared the stage with Gary Hustwit , and –full disclosure –I worked for their competitor for five years so I am not objective about IDEO , truly . )
Some designers have an amazing talent for stringing together impressive - sounding words that seem deep and thoughtful but actually just parrot trendy thoughts and say nothing .
From my son Gray , after I asked Gary ( and the vapid woman from IDEO ) a question ,
I was nervous when you raised your hand to speak …
I was pretty sure you were going to blow that question .
That ’s a teenager .
I criticise a fellow designer for giving empty answers , but my critical teenage son keeps me very humble …he ’s convinced I ’m going to screw up before I even open my mouth !
NO benefit of the doubt .
The recession and an aggressive guilt - campaign by environmentalists is weakening the market for bottled water .
For the first time in five years , bottled water sales have fallen on a year over year basis , the Washington Post reports .
According to consulting firm Beverage Marketing Corp. , Americans drank 8.7 billion gallons of bottled water last year , compared with 8.8 billion in 2007 -- the first decline this decade .
Per capita consumption dropped from 29 gallons to 28.5 .
Jeff Cioletti , editor in chief of trade publication Beverage World , said he does n't believe bottled water will return to galloping growth for a long while .
Environmentalists are super stoked .
Bottled water creates massive amounts of waste , since most people do n't recycle the bottles .
Even if they did recycle the bottles , just the creation of all that plastic is bad news .
According to Food & Water Watch , more than 17 million barrels of oil -- enough to fuel 1 million cars for a year -- are needed to produce the plastic water bottles sold in the United States annually .
And about 86 percent of the empty bottles get thrown into the trash rather than recycled .
Beverage companies have responded through recycling initiatives and purchasing carbon offsets .

From The Youngstown Vindicator :
Ohioans wanting to change their gender on state - issued driver ’s licenses or identification cards no longer have to have their body parts medically altered , under a new policy introduced by the Bureau of Motor Vehicles this month .
In the past , transgender Ohioans had to obtain letters from physicians as proof that they had completed full sex - change operations to change the gender listing .
Under the new policy , launched this week , affected residents submit a form signed by their physician or a licensed therapist or psychologist that they are living as the opposite gender , whether surgical procedures have been completed or not .
The new form includes space identifying applicants ’ birth gender , their “ gender identification ” and their “ gender change . ”
Physicians or psychologists must certify that the applicant “ is sufficiently ready for , or has completed a gender role transition , and it is intended this role change is to be permanent , ” according to the form .
“ This transition may or may not lead to further surgical intervention . ”
Translated , that means they do not necessarily have to complete gender reassignment surgery to qualify , said Lindsay Komlanc , spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Public Safety .
“ In that physician or therapist ’s mind , they have completed the process to the extent possible for that person , ” she said .
Komlanc said the new policy was developed after members of the transgender community approached the state agency about the process of changing one ’s gender on driver ’s licenses .
“ Not everyone who has the desire to have the full operation actually has the means for it , ” she said .
“ It is a very long process from the start to the completion of when it actually occurs .
[ And ] not everyone is actually physically able or healthy enough to have the operation . …
In the event that the person cannot have the operation , for whatever reason , the therapist can certify that they have been working with the person and that person is truly living as whichever gender it is . ”
Komlanc said a very small percentage of issued licenses are affected by the change .
Of the 8 million state - issued licenses and identification cards , fewer than 10 annually fell under former gender - change policy .
About five applications have been submitted under the new one .
Transgender Ohioans must request the new form .
Those who are in transition must submit a new one every time they renew their license .
Anyone failing to submit the forms during license renewal will have their gender designation switched back to the original , Komlanc said .
America ’s collapse into a Third World banana republic is accelerating : Alabama ’s most populous county , Jefferson County , is so broke it ’s closing down courthouses and laying off so many cops that it ’s now planning to call in the National Guard to maintain order :
BIRMINGHAM , Ala . –
The sheriff in Alabama ’s most populous county may call for the National Guard to help maintain order , a spokesman said Tuesday , after a judge cleared the way for cuts in the sheriff ’s budget and hopes dimmed for a quick end to a budget crisis .
It ’s all too fitting that the county is going broke because it ca n’t pay the $ 3.2 billion in sewer bonds that the county borrowed , on bad advice from what ’s now the biggest bailed - out bank in the land .
They sold Americans shit , and now Jefferson County is literally eating that shit .
The reason why the county is broke is because it took the advice of the same Wall Street villains who later bankrupted America .
In this case , JPMorgan Chase , which was hired by the county to act as advisor , and wound up not only giving the worst advice imaginable , pawning toxic assets onto the gullible hicks , but also charging them six times the normal bank fees–that ’s right , JPMorgan charged the county six times the going rate for advice that ruined the county , according to Bloomberg :
The county relied on advice from a bank , JPMorgan Chase & Co. , to arrange its funding , rather than use competitive bidding .
The county paid banks $ 120 million in fees — six times the prevailing rate — for $ 5.8 billion in interest - rate swaps .
That was supposed to protect the county from rising rates for their bonds .
Lending rates went the wrong way , putting the county $ 277 million deeper into debt .
That means local officials now have to pay to banks money that otherwise might have been used to build schools , hospitals or public housing .
Why would a county do something that stupid , buying up toxic assets for 6 times the price ?
The answer is so obvious that the SEC and FBI even made a show of investigating , but the only thing that ’s come of the investigation so far is that taxpayers were forced to bail out the Wall Street thieves who tricked them , while leaving citizens to fuck off and die :
“ It ’s ironic that the Fed can do corporate welfare for the banks , but they ca n’t bail out a county that was victimized by these banks , ” says Craig Greer , a Catholic chaplain at a Birmingham hospice .
The SEC and Justice Department are probing whether the banks that financed Jefferson County conspired nationwide to fix prices for derivatives , violating the Sherman Antitrust Act , according to target letters sent to bank employees .
That was a year ago .
By May of this year , the SEC was still making its empty threats , but by then it had already given Bank of America , which sold similar bullshit swaps to sucker - counties around the country , complete amnesty :
Bank of America was granted amnesty by the Justice Department for its cooperation in the national antitrust probe .
In exchange for voluntarily providing information and offering continuing cooperation , the federal government agreed not to bring criminal charges against the bank .
Brian Marchiony , a JPMorgan spokesman , declined to comment .
The company said in yesterday ’s filing that it is “ engaged in discussions ” with the SEC to reach a resolution before the agency files a civil complaint .
SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment and Jefferson County Commissioner Jim Carns said he was unaware of any SEC moves against JPMorgan .
Right , so all BofA had to do was agree to snitch on everyone else –which is about as much a concession as telling a tapeworm that if it wants to continue thriving , it ’s going to have to continue sucking on someone ’s intestinal walls …or else !
Meanwhile , the gullible hicks are suffering –just like the whole country –while the Wall Street plutocrats laugh all the way to the taxpayer - subsidized bank .
Sewage and water bills in the county were so high last year that some people had to choose between heat and water :
As nighttime temperatures plunged in Birmingham , Alabama , last October , Dora Bonner had a choice : either pay the gas bill so she could heat the home she shares with four grandchildren , or send the Birmingham Water Works a $ 250 check for her water and sewer bill .
Bonner , who is 73 and lives on Social Security , decided to keep the house from freezing .
` I could n’t afford the water , so they shut it off , ” she says .
Bonner ’s sewer bills have risen more than fourfold in the past decade .
So have those of others in Jefferson County , which has 659,000 residents and includes Birmingham , the state ’s largest city .
So there you have it : life in the banana republic of norteamerica .
The banks fleece the peasantry , and when they ’ve been picked clean and ca n’t pay another red peso , the federal government calls in la guardia nacional to keep order .
It ’s a good thing–from the oligarchy ’s view , that is –that the suckers only response is to crash townhall meetings demanding that they not be given free health care , while spending all their unemployed time searching for holes in Obama ’s birth certificate rather than the holes in their own wallets .
Americans are the only idiots in the world who take an old - fashioned ass - rape without even putting up a fight .

Ten years ago on Sunday , Russia 's Duma confirmed Vladimir Putin as prime minister .
The vote took place only one week after then - President Boris Yeltsin had nominated the little - known former KGB operative for the post .
Yeltsin 's surprise resignation only four months later left Mr. Putin as acting president and paved the way for his election as head of state in March 2000 .
This swift and far - from - transparent ascent to the pinnacle of Russian power was a sign of things to come .
Over the past decade Vladimir Putin has used the ...
I spent Friday evening with naked exhibitionists ; sodomites ; and megaphallic , lecherous drunkards , among others .
This did not occur at a local bar ( although much of it probably could have ) .
Jack had mentioned a small church in the Pyrenees with an erotic capital .
Although a search did not turn up that particular church , in a burst of geekified art - historical zeal , I discovered that there are dozens upon dozens of lewd church carvings inside and on the facades of 11th and 12th - century Romanesque churches and cathedrals throughout France .
Who knew ?
The web site I found with the most examples and information was http://www.beyond-the-pale.org.uk/ .
According to the site 's author , Anthony Weir , the series of corbel sculptures around the roof line of the church ’s exterior included iconic figures that were regarded by the faithful as a gallery of sinners .
The artists themselves may have just been portraying their own lay culture .
One such character is this corbel figure of a female Exhibitionistic Acrobat on the church at Fontaines d’Ozillac in the Charente - Maritime .
( These are fairly common in Spain and France . )
The church considered actors and tumblers to be " against nature " and therefore wicked .
The gesture of mouth - pulling indicates she is a theatrical entertainer .
The message the corbel sculpture of a leering contortionist is meant to send to the illiterate viewers below is that actors are evil and their performances should be shunned .
Another stock character in the repertoire of didactic religious sculpture is the Lecherous Drunk ( this one located in Béceleuf , Deux - Sevres ) .
This character ’s love for alcohol is symbolized by the wine barrel he holds .
His oversized genitals index the sins of carnality to which alcohol consumption can lead .
The onlooker is thus warned about the dual sins of insobriety and concupiscence .
The megaphallic Glutton of Champagnolles in the Charente - Maritime is seen ingurgitating something that could be a large piece of cake .
( Or maybe it is " a piece of cheese the size of a car battery " like the one George Costanza dreamed of on Seinfeld . )
I am not certain what the connection is between gluttony and gigantic genitals , but perhaps it signifies a generalized insatiability .
Sins of the flesh were represented by grotesque male figures , displaying and sometimes licking their outsized masculine apparatus .
This limber male figure ( Solignac , Haute - Vienne ) is shown engaged in that activity .
A vulva-pulling female appears at the church of Sainte Radegonde in Poitiers , Vienne .
The small city of Poitiers has no fewer than six Romanesque churches , so it is a must for those who are fascinated by this architectural style .
The idea of damnation was commonly shown by monsters swallowing up the bodies of sinners , just as the realm of Satan would swallow up their souls .
This sodomite ( Conques , Aveyron ) is being clubbed by a devil and is forced into the jaws of a beast representing the mouth of hell .
At La Chaize - le - Vicomte in the Vendée , sodomy occurs between two traveling entertainers , reminding us again that performers were seen as damned souls .
Shifting gears a bit , this clothed couple ( Maillezais , Deux - Sevres ) , each with a halo , is shown embracing .
It may be a depiction of Christian marriage .
The couple 's saucer - eyed stare may suggest a focus on the sacred .
( I 'm spooked by that middle eye -- which face does it belong to ??? )
Although not a portrayal of exhibitionism , the man ’s tunic does not quite cover all the action that is taking place .
In Civray ( Vienne ) an upside - down concupiscent woman , naked but for her shoes , plummets toward hell .
( I guess this is a literal take on the " fallen woman " )
This one is made notable by its large size and proximity to the altar .
By the 13th century , such grotesqueries were much less common , and usually limited to gargoyles or barely visible places .
Although there are many more examples of shameless Medieval behavior carved in French church stones , this was about as much excitement as I could stand for one Friday night .
To conclude , if you are visiting a Romanesque church and do n’t want to miss out on the lessons these naughty little guys and gals perched way up high can teach us , take your field glasses along .
You might remember the guy who snagged a home run ball to save the life of a bikini sunbather .
Well , some kid at yesterday ’s Texas Rangers - Red Sox game one - upped that accomplishment by snagging two foul balls in ONE AT - BAT !
3 pitches apart .
The hitter ?
God ’s child – Josh Hamilton .
Of course the Rangers broadcast team made CJ the Fan of the Game and went in for an interview with the new legend .

Posted : August 16 , 2009
Premise of Video : CJ is minding his business in front of Red Sox fans on a lazy Arlington Sunday afternoon when a foul ball comes his way .
Josh Hamilton is at - bat .
Just a routine foul ball comes flying into CJ ’s area .
He goes up and robs Red Sox fan of the souvenir .
3 pitches later .
It happens again .
Odds of that happening : worse than hitting for the cycle in both games of a doubleheader .
Climax of Video :
The sideline reporter guy congratulating him on robbing the Sox fans .
Nice snub , reporter boy .
Conclusion : CJ will now enjoy an entire week of being praised by the blogosphere .
I ’m at two deficit conferences Wednesday — CAP in the morning , on what to do about the deficit , EPI in the afternoon , about why we need to run deficits now .
I ’m trying to organize my thoughts ; in this post I ’ll talk about the EPI issue , in the next the CAP issue .
So let me start with a picture , which I ’ll leave hanging for a moment :
Now for the discussion .
Why , exactly , do we think that budget deficits are a bad thing ?
The textbook answer identifies two reasons — two ways in which budget deficits now make us worse off in the future .
They are :
(1) The fiscal burden : deficits now mean higher debt later , which will have to be serviced , and that means higher taxes and / or less spending on other , presumably desirable things
(2) Crowding out : when it runs deficits , the government competes with the private sector for funds , so deficits crowd out private investment , which reduces potential growth
All this makes sense under normal conditions .
But right now we ’re not living under normal conditions .
We ’re in a situation in which the economy is deeply depressed , and monetary policy — the usual line of defense against recession — is hard up against the zero - interest - rate bound .
This weakens argument ( 1 ) — and it actually reverses argument ( 2 ) .
On argument ( 1 ) : it ’s still true that an increase in government spending raises future debt .
But not one for one : because higher spending raises GDP , it leads to higher revenue , which offsets a significant fraction of the initial outlay .
A back - of - the - envelope calculation suggests something like a 40 percent offset is plausible , so fiscal stimulus only costs 60 percent of what it costs .
But the really dramatic difference is for argument ( 2 ) .
Under the kind of conditions we ’re now facing , the main determinant of business investment is the state of the economy , as evidenced by the plunge in investment shown in the figure .
This , in turn , means that anything that improves the state of the economy , including fiscal stimulus , leads to more investment , and hence raises the economy ’s future potential .
That is , under current conditions deficit spending does n’t lead to crowding out — it leads to crowding in .
In fact , you could argue that the worst thing we can do for future generations is NOT to run sufficiently large deficits right now .
Things wo n’t always work this way .
Eventually we ’ll emerge from the liquidity trap , and the normal rules of economic prudence will reassert themselves .
But we are not there , or anywhere close to there , right now .

This was a project my grandfather worked on when I was a kid , and it used to terrify me , as I have an inexplicable fear of these evil creatures .
I am hoping to sell it by the end of the month , as I owe child support and do n't have the cash to cover it at the moment .
This was built off of the frame of an otherwise perfect 1986 Yugo Cabrio .
The vehicle itself has 38,000 miles on it , but it was badly damaged in a hailstorm and the bodywork was completely demolished .
My grandfather got the idea of turning it into a WhaleMobile off of some cartoon , and he took his crazy idea and ran with it .

Große Teile des US - Rettungspakts für Banken werden vermutlich nicht zurückgezahlt Florian Rötzer
TARP - Inspekteur zeichnet vor dem Finanzausschuss des Senats ein düsteres Bild .
Das 700 - Milliarden -Dollar-Bankenrettungsprogramm TARP , das noch von der Bush - Regierung stammt , sollte den Zusammenbrauch des Finanzsystems verhindern .
Wie Neil Barofsky , der als Generalinspekteur von TARP fungiert , vor dem Finanzausschuss des Senats erst einmal noch verhalten sagte , sei es " unklar " , ob die Regierung ihr Ziel erreiche , die Rückzahlung der gewährten Unterstützung für die Steuerzahler " zu maximieren " .
Zwar hätten einige Banken , die TARP - Gelder erhalten haben , diese mit Zinsen zurückgezahlt , so gibt ABC das schriftliche Statement wieder , " aber es ist extrem unwahrscheinlich , dass der Steuerzahler mit der vollständigen Rückzahlung rechnen kann " .
So werde es für das auf 50 Milliarden Dollar belaufende Programm zur Unterstützung der Kreditzahler keine direkte Rückzahlung geben .
Auch für die Milliarden , die die Autokonzerne oder die AIG – die US - Version der Hypo Real Estate - erhalten hat , bestehe große Unsicherheit .
Erreicht habe man mit dem Bankenrettungsprogramm zwar eine gewisse Stabilisierung , aber nicht das Ziel , dass die Banken wieder mehr Kredite geben .
Zudem sei nicht erreicht worden , dass Menschen ihre Häuser und Angestellte ihre Jobs behalten konnten .
Die Zwangsräumungen seien weiter gestiegen , die Arbeitslosigkeit liege bei 9,7 Prozent .
Die riskanten toxischen Papiere seien zudem weitgehend dort geblieben , wo sie im letzten Herbst gewesen sind , nämlich in den Bilanzen der Banken : " Und es wird immer deutlicher " , so zeichnet Barofsky sein düsteres Bild , " dass der kommerzielle Immobilienmarkt der nächste Stein ist , der fällt , wodurch der Druck auf die Banken und die kleinen Unternehmen wieder zunehmen wird . "
Klar drückte sich der TARP - Kontrolleur auch gegen dem Finanzministerium aus , das es noch immer nicht geschafft habe , für die angekündigte Transparenz zu sorgen und zu veröffentlichen , wer wieviel Geld erhalten hat und wofür die Steuergelder verwendet wurden .
Man habe nur einige Schritte unternommen , aber insgesamt sei die Haltung des Finanzministeriums frustrierend : " TARP bleibt weitgehend ein Programm , bei dem die Steuerzahler nicht erfahren , was die meisten TAP - Empfänger mit ihrem Geld machen , und ihnen nicht vollständig gesagt wird , wie ihr Geld investiert wird . "
Das Finanzministerium weist die Vorwürfe erwartungsgemäß zurück .
Der von Obama ernannte Finanzminister Geithner hatte noch als Fed - Chef von New York bei der schnellen Vergabe der Milliarden im November 2008 mitgemauschelt .
Nach Gene L. Dodaro vom Government Accountability Office sind von den 363 Milliarden ausgegebenen TARP - Geldern bis 31 .
August etwas 80 Milliarden zurückgeflossen , darunter 7 Milliarden an Zinsen .
Auch Dodaro erklärte , es gäbe viele Probleme , bemängelt wurde auch von ihm die fehlende Transparenz .
Computer scientists have figured out to how trick a widely used electronic voting machine into altering tallies with a technique that bypasses measures that are supposed to prevent unauthorized code from running on the device .
The method , known as return - oriented programming , has already been used to defeat security measures built into the Linux and OpenBSD operating systems .
Now scientists have used it against the Sequoia AVC Advantage machine , which is used almost universally in New Jersey and in parts of Louisiana , Pennsylvania , Wisconsin , Colorado and Virginia , according to the Verified Voting Foundation .
The machine is programmed to execute code only when it 's stored on read - only memory chips that are difficult to install and remove .
By expressly forbidding the running of code contained in random access memory , the designers intended to make it impossible for attackers to inject malicious programs that might compromise the integrity or confidentiality of the election .
The computer scientists were able to evade this safety mechanism using return - oriented programming .
Rather than designing the malicious code from scratch , the technique reassembles programming expressions already found in the targeted software in a way that gives the researchers the ability to take complete control over the machine .
It 's tantamount to kidnappers who write a ransom note using letters cut from the headline of a newspaper .
The research team - from Princeton University , the University of California at San Diego and the University of Michigan - pulled off the attack by obtaining a Sequoia AVC Advantage legally off the internet .
Without access to any of the source code , they reverse engineered the hardware .
They were then able to reverse engineer the software it ran by analyzing the machine 's ROM .
Sequoia and manufacturers of other brands of e-voting machines frequently discount vulnerability research into their products by pointing out that the underlying source code is closely guarded .
Researchers in many studies , they argue , have unrealistic access to the devices ' inner workings .
" What we have shown or what I hope we have shown in this paper is that that criticism in untrue , " Hovav Shacham a professor at UC San Diego , told The Register .
" It might take a little more work if we do n't have the source , but nevertheless we 're able to find vulnerabilities and exploit them in useful ways in machines where the only access we have is the physical artifacts themselves . "
Sequoia in the past has gone to great lengths to prevent outsiders from peering into its proprietary voting machines .
Last year , it threatened to sue after a county in New Jersey asked Princeton University researchers to inspect election gear suspected of malfunctioning during the presidential primary election .
The exploit works successfully on AVC Advantage machines running software version five , Shacham said .
It remains unclear if the flaw that makes the attack possible is contained in newer versions of the software .
The proof - of - concept attack caused the machine to steal votes in a pre-determined way .
The code that makes it possible can be installed in a few minutes .
While a simple rebooting of the machine causes the malicious instructions to vanish , the exploit also caused the machine to appear as if it were turned off when in fact it was turned on .
When the power switch is activated , the malware makes the machine appear to boot up .
A Sequoia spokeswoman said she had n't read the report and had no comment .
She suggested interested parties look here for responses to previous research by Princeton professor Andrew Appel , a computer scientist who has long criticized the security of the machine .
Return - oriented programming has already been shown to be an effective way of piercing protections such as WxorX found in Linux , OpenBSD and Solaris .
Its application to the Sequoia machine is impressive because the device is undocumented except to a select few who have signed non-disclosure agreements .
The research was presented Monday at the Electronic Voting Technology Workshop / Workshop of Trustworthy Elections .
The paper in PDF and slides are available here and here respectively .
" It 's excellent research , " said David Wagner , a computer scientist from the University of California at Berkeley who attended the conference and was not involved in the paper .
" The research is significant because it illustrates that attacks get better over time and it shows just how difficult it is to protect paperless voting systems . " ®

Anyone who reads Paul Krugman , our latest " Nobel Prize - winning economist , " knows that Krugman believes inflation is not a threat to the economy at all .
He is a regular defender of large fiscal deficits and expansionary monetary policy , claiming that they are the road to salvation from our so - called deflationary spiral .
( We 'll ignore the fact that this " deflationary spiral " involves six straight months of price increases and regular complaints from Mr. Krugman himself about skyrocketing costs in health care . )
In 2009 , Krugman stated that " deficits saved the world . "
However , in 2003 , when Alan Greenspan and the Bush administration were destroying this country 's balance sheet , Krugman was scared to death about inflation .
The rest of this article references several paragraphs from Mr. Krugman 's March 11th , 2003 , article , " A Fiscal Train Wreck . "
With war looming , it 's time to be prepared .
So last week I switched to a fixed - rate mortgage .
It means higher monthly payments , but I 'm terrified about what will happen to interest rates once financial markets wake up to the implications of skyrocketing budget deficits .
Since 2003 , not only has the dollar lost purchasing power , but also inflationary pressures have grown like cancers .
As a result , our deficits are bigger and our economy is weaker .
Meanwhile , Ben Bernanke has run the printing presses at full speed and given no indication that he will slow them down any time soon .
Last week the Congressional Budget Office marked down its estimates yet again .
Just two years ago , you may remember , the C.B.O. was projecting a 10 - year surplus of $ 5.6 trillion .
Now it projects a 10 - year deficit of $ 1.8 trillion .
In 2009 , the deficit projection is now $ 9 trillion .
That 's a $ 14 trillion swing from the $ 5.6 trillion surplus eight years ago .
We should do ourselves a favor and stop acting like any of their projections are realistic .
If Vegas were taking bets , the point spread would be another $ 7 trillion .
As far as the CBO goes , Mr. Krugman says himself ,
the Congressional Budget Office operates under ground rules that force it to wear rose - colored lenses .
We are royally screwed when a $ 9 trillion budget deficit is the rose - colored version .
Maybe we should be preparing for a $ 16 trillion deficit .
What 's really scary — what makes a fixed - rate mortgage seem like such a good idea — is the looming threat to the federal government 's solvency .
That may sound alarmist : right now the deficit , while huge in absolute terms , is only 2 — make that 3 , O.K. , maybe 4 — percent of G.D.P .
But that misses the point .
If Paul Krugman was worried about a $ 3 trillion budget deficit and a debt - to - GDP ratio of 4 percent six years ago , a $ 9 trillion budget deficit and a debt - to - GDP ratio of 40 percent today should have him preparing for financial Armageddon .
The reality of the situation is that we are facing the biggest currency crisis in our nation 's history .
Because of the future liabilities of Social Security and Medicare , the true budget picture is much worse than the conventional deficit numbers suggest .
This is exactly what most sane economists are saying today .
Ironically , Mr. Krugman now likes to conveniently ignore those Social Security and Medicare liabilities that he was so frightened about in 2003 .
Let us not forget , he also conveniently ignores our newly pledged liabilities to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as well .
My prediction is that politicians will eventually be tempted to resolve the crisis the way irresponsible governments usually do : by printing money , both to pay current bills and to inflate away debt .
And as that temptation becomes obvious , interest rates will soar .
His point here is 100 percent correct and crucial .
The government , now under Barack Obama , has officially entered the stage of printing money to pay its bills and inflate away the debt .
The problem is that Mr. Krugman now denies that such actions ( printing money ) are even occurring , and uses a megaphone to cheer the quantitative easing performed by Ben Bernanke .
He also regularly attacks any person who even mentions the possibility of interest rates rising .
The Paul Krugman of 2009 completely disagrees with the Paul Krugman of 2003 .
I think that the main thing keeping long - term interest rates low right now is cognitive dissonance . …
The ultra-establishment Committee for Economic Development now warns that " a fiscal crisis threatens our future standard of living . "
Obviously , Mr. Krugman was fearful of inflation .
He wanted his nice home in Princeton to be paid off with funny money from the Federal Reserve .
In the near future , he 'll finally get his wish .
The key message is that in 2003 , Mr. Krugman wrote a great article with an incredibly accurate picture of the financial health of the United States at the time .
There is no question that George W. Bush was the worst president we ever had .
There is also no question that Alan Greenspan was the worst Federal Reserve Chairman we ever had .
" The Paul Krugman of 2009 completely disagrees with the Paul Krugman of 2003 . "
The problem is that everything Mr. Krugman now writes entirely contradicts his 2003 article , despite the fact that every fundamental problem the economy faced six years ago is now much worse .
Mr. Krugman has no issues with Barack Obama and Ben Bernanke committing the same atrocities the previous administration committed .
President Obama has ramped up every budget , including the military budget , while Bernanke runs the presses faster than Greenspan ever did .
Mr. Krugman has consistently stated throughout 2009 that there is no danger of interest rates rising in the future and that the budget deficit is not disastrous by comparison to 1940s United States and 1990s Japan .
But our GDP consists heavily of government spending and a consumer - based service sector ( which is apparently a nonissue in the mindset of your typical Keynesian crackpot ) .
Therefore , our GDP severely overstates our nation 's productive capacity and is no longer a measure of our economic strength .
How can a country that produces so little have a high Gross Domestic " Product " ?
After World War II , the United States was a creditor nation .
Japan is currently a creditor nation .
The present day United States is a debtor nation , in fact the largest one the world has ever seen .
Our nation 's debt is held externally while the 1940s United States ' and 1990s Japan 's were held internally .
In the past , we financed our debt through 30 - year bonds , as did Japan .
Today , a large portion of our debt is financed through 2 - year bonds .
What happens if those interest rates creep higher ?
The United States must turn to the printing press to avoid default .
Investors still can't believe that the leaders of the United States are acting like the rulers of a banana republic .
But I 've done the math , and reached my own conclusions — and I 've locked in my rate .
Given our administration 's actions , we are officially becoming a banana republic ; no matter how many times Mr. Krugman tells us on TV " we are not Argentina . "
Mr. Krugman made a wise choice in 2003 to convert his mortgage to a fixed rate over the course of 30 years .
Why on Earth would he recommend that the entire nation take out debt financed in 2 - year bonds ?
America is essentially signing up for a subprime mortgage , and we are assuming that we can simply refinance before the rates reset .
Mr. Krugman should do us all a favor and stop lying to the American people .
When interest rates rise , and inflation skyrockets out of control , millions of Americans are going to wonder why Paul Krugman told us it would n't happen .
With every word he writes , I wonder how big that conscience of a liberal really is .

Walter B. Jones has sent more than 8,000 letters of sympathy to the survivors of U.S. service members killed in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The Republican Congressman from North Carolina keeps writing them – in part as penance , he says , for the vote for war he cast on Oct. 10 , 2002 .
" I think I have been forgiven , " he told me in a recent interview , with a rare note of hope , " through all those letters .
I really do . "
To say it is extraordinary to hear a United States congressman say he has begged forgiveness from God for a vote he considers a mistake is an understatement .
In an era when politicians back - flip , flip - flop , scurry , and scramble to retract statements and explain away votes , Rep. Jones seems to have much in common with Jimmy Stewart ’s Sen. Jefferson Smith in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington , except instead of a political row over graft and a dam the local bigwig wants to build , Jones ’ story is of a man who remains haunted by his own failure to initially resist intelligence manipulated by the White House to sell a war it wanted to wage .
While Smith ’s celluloid stand came in the form of a redemptive filibuster , Jones was one of a handful of House Republicans who began to publicly excoriate the war in Iraq after 2004 .
Standing beside such congressional misfits as Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) and Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) , Jones called repeatedly for a timetable and an exit , much to the chagrin of President George W. Bush and the Republican Party .
Unlike the breadth of Christian conservatives in Washington – particularly Evangelicals , whose support for Iraq and the entire Global War on Terror is virtually messianic – Jones , 66 , a Catholic , believes his opposition is rooted in both the Constitution and the Bible ; it ’s the morally right thing to do .
Rep. Walter Jones ( Steve Barrett )
" I want to do what I think my Lord wants me to do , ” Jones told Mother Jones magazine in early 2006 .
Talk like that must have been double battery acid to the ears of Iraq war cheerleader Christopher Hitchens , an avowed atheist who the year before had called Jones a " political and moral cretin " for his change of heart .
But while Hitchens today is debating Catholic cardinals and rattling the saber for a confrontation with Iran , Jones has survived two reelection efforts in a rural , conservative district that ’s home to Camp Lejeune , a U.S. Army installation and major war feeder .
He attributes his success to his honesty , and perhaps just a little to the fact that people are now realizing he might be right , after all .
The Weight of the Dead
Jones plainly sees his failure to question the administration ’s claims that Saddam Hussein was an imminent threat to the country back in 2002 playing out on the battlefields of Iraq – and by extension , Afghanistan , and in the faces of the wounded and the families and friends of dead soldiers , sailors , and Marines .
He plays over his conversion like it was yesterday , and he speaks with the pathos of a man still bearing a cross - like burden .
" When I went to the floor of the House to give the president the authority to go into Iraq , I did not feel that the briefing that I had attended had convinced me that there were weapons of mass destruction , and yet I was not strong enough to vote my conscience , " he said in our interview .
" I was thinking of the politics , you know … .
You represent a military district and a lot of retired military , so I voted for the resolution . "
" The vote , " he said , " I regretted even after I voted . "
The niggling of uncertainty did not stop Jones from urging the change from " French fries " to " Freedom fries " in the House cafeterias in March 2003 – a rebuke to the French government for not supporting the march to war .
By now , however , he probably has more in common with the French on war issues than with some of his more prominent GOP colleagues on Capitol Hill , as he has turned his attention from Iraq to putting the breaks on a Democratic president ’s seeming advance into an indefinite occupation of Central Asia .
" The troops are worn out … we ’re about to break the military , " Jones said .
" Mr. Obama , in my opinion , needs to slow it down , and he needs to have an endpoint to whatever we ’re trying to achieve .
And I base that more on history .
History speaks for itself , in Afghanistan . "
Jones looks at Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) and Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) already boosting a troop increase and knows his mission wo n’t be easy .
Especially now that , as a party , Democrats are naturally torn between their impulse to stop the war and their new fidelity to the man in the Oval Office .
As public opinion polls and the Washington punditocracy finally come around to acknowledging the potentially malignant deficiencies in the U.S. / NATO counterinsurgency in Afghanistan , Jones has already been out front for months , demanding there not be an escalation beyond the nearly 70,000 U.S. troops planned for deployment by the end of this year .
In June , he sponsored an amendment to the 2010 National Defense Authorization
Act that would have required the secretary of defense to outline an exit strategy for Afghanistan – something President Obama has supported rhetorically , but so far not in practice .
The amendment , co-sponsored with Rep. James McGovern ( D - Mass . ) , failed .
Jones continues his quest , speaking on the floor of the House as recently as this month , to get his point across .
" While I regret the amendment was not approved , " he said on the floor Sept. 8 , " I still believe it is critical of the administration to articulate benchmarks for success and an endpoint to its strategy for Afghanistan … rather than simply ordering another surge of troops . "
" The stress placed on our all - volunteer force cannot continue forever , " he declared .
" So that ’s where I am now , " he said later in our interview .
" We [ McGovern and I ] sent a letter to every member of the House … and this week , me and McGovern will probably be meeting with Sen . [ Russ ] Feingold , to see about a strategy . "
Some more from our interview :
Antiwar.com :
It would seem that the same forces are lining up on familiar ends of the war debate : you are on the side of finding an exit strategy and not fueling the nearly nine - year war with more troops ; Senators John McCain , Lindsey Graham , and Joe Lieberman are on the side of pumping more resources in .
Do you sense any shift under this Democratic Congress and White House away from the open - ended operations in Afghanistan ?
And how do you think the most recent debate over more troops will shake out ?
Congressman Jones :
When we debated the armed services bill , which is the authorization bill for next year ’s plans for the military , [ Rep . ]
Jim McGovern and I offered the McGovern - Jones amendment , which called for the secretary of defense to present a plan for an exit strategy by the end of December 2009 .
That got about 138 votes … we got about what we thought we would from Republicans , maybe 10 or 12 votes , that ’s about it .
But I talked to Jim and I said , I ’m surprised we did n’t get 30 more votes from Democrats .
Well , according to Jim , those Democrats were saying the same things our Republicans were saying , that we want to give the president a chance .
So I heard the same things I was hearing three or four years ago , but this time I was hearing it from the Democrats .
We ’re finally broke as a country and we have to borrow money to pay our bills … we ’re breaking the military , the equipment is worn out .
My hurt is the families of the military , my hurt is the pain of people going back four or five times , and if you do n’t know what you are trying to achieve – how do you know that you ’ve achieved it ?
People know – I mean I ’ve had experts in the Army and the Marine Corps here to tell me that Afghanistan is a much tougher fight – that terrain is a factor , they ’re better fighters than those in Iraq who were opposed to the coalition .
So it ’s a matter of knowing what we want to achieve .
Antiwar.com :
Do you think more Republican members may be motivated to oppose further troop escalation in Afghanistan now that President Bush is gone and a Democrat is in the White House ?
Jones : I do n’t want to use his name … but [ Representative — ] , a very thoughtful [ Republican ] congressman , came to me the other day , and he said to me , I want to help you and Jim McGovern .
I was pleasantly surprised that he is concerned about where we are going in Afghanistan , so my point in giving you that example is that I think in a short time more Republicans will start asking the same questions , I do .
I think there are a lot of Republicans starting to question how long and how much .
Having been in Afghanistan eight years … there are some questions .
Antiwar.com :
You have impressed a lot of people on all points of the political spectrum with your stand against the party on Iraq and Afghanistan , but has it soured any relationships among colleagues , or with your constituents back home ?
Jones : I think back home what has happened is people who were opposed to my position two years ago – not all , but many – better understand my position today .
I was asked by a reporter in the district – after the primary two years ago – " Do you feel vindicated ? "
I said I cannot feel vindicated until we get the troops back home .
I guess in a way , because of my faith , I have a strong sense of right and wrong .
When you ask for this job , you know you have to make tough decisions , but again …
I have to feel that I ’ve made the right decisions based on my faith .
Antiwar.com : Did you ever feel there was an opening to draw in your fellow Christian conservatives to your position on the war , which is based in part on your faith ?
Jones :
All I can say is most members will make their independent , individual assessments .
When it comes to war , I do n’t think I can try to influence another person ’s position … it is a personal understanding .
I can tell you this : I think I have been forgiven for my own decision .
Through all those letters .
I really do .
Antiwar.com :
What kind of sense are you getting from your constituents about Afghanistan ?
Jones :
They want to know what we ’re trying to achieve .
I got 17 counties – and this is official , not political – officially I ’ve traveled over 3,000 miles in my district , and so I saw a lot of people .
And you get down to the military base area , they may fight until they drop , but the point is , what are we trying to achieve ?
And when you get these men and women three and four and five times in there , you have to get an understanding of the endpoint , or whether we really have a strategy .

The message continued :
" You know full well that no one is talking about wanting to go back to the days of segregation . "
Well , no , I do n't know it .
I do n't know that at all , seeing as how so many of the tea - bag set and anti-health care folks make " taking their country back " one of the most prominent lines of their vocalized outrage .
What does that mean , coming from people in their 60s and 70s , for whom the America of their youth was indeed a white supremacist place ?
A place where white hegemony could be taken as a given , something that could be presumed in perpetuity ?
What does it mean when someone says that they want to go back to the country the way the founders envisioned it , as many have also explained at these rallies ?
After all , they envisioned a white republic .
They envisioned and sought out the extirpation of indigenous peoples , most believed in the enslavement of African peoples , and none truly believed that blacks should be treated as equals .
" But that 's not what we 're talking about when we say we want our country back , " another writer intoned , also angered by my televised comments : " We are n't talking about the racism part .
We mean the rest of it . "
How fascinating .
That it is factually impossible to separate out the " racism part " from the rest of it is something many white folks seem not to understand .
They seem to think there was once a time of innocence when oppression was n't happening , or that we can easily extract from our accounting of those crimes the great and noble things about our forefathers and view them in some patriotic vacuum .
But we can't .
Anymore so than we can say that the man who beats his wife might still be a loving father .
Or that the company that poisons the air and water with toxic chemicals is still okay because they have a good record on labor or because they give a percentage of their annual profits to charity .
This second writer sought to explain herself further however , just so as not to be misunderstood .
When people like her claim they want to return to " what our forefathers started , " she continued , they simply mean the part about being dependent on God , rather than government .
Okay , I suppose .
Of course , last time I checked God was n't offering to pick up the tab for chemo treatments , organ transplants , or any other medical procedure for that matter .
Oh , and not to put too fine a point on it , but the founders actually did foster quite a lot of government dependence : enshrining slavery was about government protecting white people from the competition of free black labor , and white folks becoming quite dependent on that protection .
Stealing native land and then redistributing it to white people was about dependence on government - imposed violence .
And later , yet still in the supposedly " good old days , " government dependence was at the heart of segregation -- which artificially subsidized white people in the job , school and housing markets -- and was at the heart of the FHA and VA loans that white families used ( and from which black families were all but completely blocked ) in the 40s and 50s , which literally built the white middle class .
But I 'm guessing that when she uses a phrase like " dependence on government " she is n't thinking about the white folks who were given 270 million acres of essentially free land under the Homestead Act .
Or the 15 million or so white families who got those racially preferential home loans , with government underwriting and guarantees , thanks to programs implemented by liberals and thanks to pressure from the left .
I 'm thinking she is n't talking about the white soldiers ( but typically not the black ones ) who were able to return from World War II and make use of the GI Bill to go to college , or get job training .
And the fact that she likely does n't think of those kinds of things and those kinds of people as being dependent on government is , of course , precisely the problem , and the point I was trying to make .
Indeed several of the e-mails made this same argument about opposing " government dependence , " all the while oblivious , it appears , to the way in which that concept has become so color - coded in the white imagination over the past several decades .
In fact , this is a point I had made on the program : that according to a significant body of social science research ( among the most prominent , Martin Gilens 's brilliant book , Why Americans Hate Welfare ) , most whites perceive social program spending aimed at helping the have - nots ( be they income have - nots , housing have - nots , or health care - have nots ) as being about giving something to those people , who are , of course , conceived of in black and brown terms , and taking from " hard - working " white folks in order to do it .
So if the notion of government dependence itself has been racialized -- and the evidence says it has been -- to say that it is only this dependence you oppose , and that racism has nothing to do with it is to either lie or engage in self - deception of a most unfortunate and unbecoming variety .
There were of course others who wrote to me , and who felt no need to finesse their hostility ; those who wore that hostility quite clearly on their electronic sleeve , in fact .
Like the one guy who called me , in big capital letters , a " FUCKING FAGGOT , " because nothing demonstrates a keen command of the health care issue better than a little random homophobia .
Or the guy who mentioned -- in response to an incident I had discussed on the show -- that he too had cheered when the white man attacked the black woman holding a Rosa Parks poster in the Missouri town hall meeting .
To him , the woman deserved to be assaulted and thrown out of the hall because she was ( and here he was simply stealing the latest line from the woefully under- medicated Michael Savage ) " nothing but a race baiter . "
This , unlike , say , the whites in the crowd with signs calling the President a nigger , or the talk show hosts who have been claiming for months that Obama hates white people , hates white culture , and really only wants health care reform as a form of reparations for black people .
To him , the black victim of white thuggery is a race - baiter , but the white kid with the sign calling Obama a monkey is probably just an all - American boy , and the whites with the signs comparing the President to Adolf Hitler , are just under - appreciated amateur historians , making obvious analytical points that real historians are just too obtuse , or , ya know , educated , to understand .
In the end , although there are many people , with many different reasons for opposing the President or his health care proposal , the role that race and racism is playing cannot be ignored .
With major conservative spokespersons stoking the fires of racial resentment daily , and with most whites having long ago come to the conclusion that social program spending is something done on behalf of racial " minorities " at their own white expense , it is not too much to insist that race is operating , for some quite overtly and for others more subtly .
And for those who insist racism has nothing to do with it , the question remains why they have said nothing to those persons coming to their rallies and giving exactly that impression by way of the signs they carry .
Where are their letters or calls to Limbaugh or Beck , chastising them for saying Obama hates white people , or that health care is just a form of reparations -- racial payback of white America ?
Of course they have written no such letters .
They have made no such calls .
They are too busy .
Busy waxing nostalgic for bygone days , which they mis-remember as a time of innocence , of decency , and of self - reliance , but which days were really days of widespread injustice , profound indecency , and institutionalized racial preference for people like them .
They can neither accept the present as it is , nor , interestingly , the past as it was .
So they invent a phony version of the latter , while hoping against hope for a reversal of the former .
Let us deny them the ability to do either for very long .
Tim Wise is the author of four books on racism .
His latest is Between Barack and a Hard Place : Racism and White Denial in the Age of Obama .

Downloading copyrighted music over peer - to - peer networks — is it legal in the US ?
Judging by the comments and e-mails that we received while covering the two federal file - swapping trials of 2009 , it 's clear that some minority of our readership believed that these lawsuits were only about uploading files ; some also believed that downloading music was in fact legal as well , and that one was within the law so long as no further sharing took place .
Neither position , however , is accurate .
First up : the question of what exactly was at issue in the trials of Jammie Thomas - Rasset ( Minnesota ) and Joel Tenenbaum ( Massachusetts ) .
RIAA legal complaints are generally boilerplate documents , and the charges against each defendant are largely identical .
The Jammie Thomas - Rasset complaint is typical :
Plaintiffs are informed and believe that Defendant , without the permission or consent of Plaintiffs , has used , and continues to use , an online media distribution system to download the Copyrighted Recordings , to distribute the Copyrighted Recordings to the public , and / or to make the Copyrighted Recordings available for distribution to others .
In doing so , Defendant has violated Plaintiffs ' exclusive rights of reproduction and distribution .
The Copyright Act provides several specific rights to copyright owners , including the right to distribute the work and the right to make copies of the work ( the " distribution " and " reproduction " rights ) .
Uploading files on P2P networks can infringe a record company 's distribution right , while downloading a file necessarily makes a copy of that file and therefore can infringe the reproduction right .
Both rights are mentioned in the recording industry complaints .
In case that language is n't clear enough , the complaints spell it out even more plainly toward the end , when they demand an injunction against the defendant in question .
Such an injunction would " ban Thomas from using the Internet or any online media distribution system to reproduce ( i.e. , download ) and of Plaintiffs '
Recordings [ or ] to distribute ( i.e. , upload ) any of Plaintiffs ' Recordings . "
The industry has always been concerned about both downloads and uploads , and indeed spent a fair bit of time at trial attempting to show that much of the music in a user 's share folder was downloaded from P2P networks .
In the Thomas - Rasset trial , for instance , record industry lawyers showed that many of the music files in Thomas - Rasset 's " share " folder contained metadata showing that they were made by ripping crews — and had presumably been downloaded via P2P .
As for uploading , record industry investigators tried to show this more directly by putting MediaSentry on the witness stand .
MediaSentry had identified the IP addresses assigned to Thomas - Rasset and Tenenbaum in the first place and had then downloaded several complete tracks from each user in an attempt to prove that they were distributing files .
The record industry position is clear : both uploads and downloads are illegal , and both can result in lawsuits .
We checked in with Electronic Frontier Foundation 's Fred von Lohmann to see if he agreed with the music business legal position .
" Does it infringe US copyright law to download music without authorization from a P2P network ? " he said .
" It depends .
If you 're a teacher who needs a clip for use in a class presentation , I think there 's a good chance it 's a fair use .
But if you 're downloading just because you do n't want to pay for the song , then you 're probably an infringer .
Intermediate cases can be imagined , but that gives a pretty good idea of the two poles . "
( When it comes to appropriate penalty for infringement , though , von Lohmann parts ways with the record industry . )
So much for the legality of downloading .
Practically speaking , though , mere downloading has not been enough to trigger RIAA attention , due largely to the difficulty of detecting it .
MediaSentry and other RIAA investigators can see the files that they download from others , and the IP addresses of those offering the files , but seeing what files those people are themselves downloading can be difficult or impossible .
Canada , a downloader 's haven ?
Note that the law applies only to a " medium , " not a device .
Furthermore , it applies only to music ; downloading video games or movies remains infringement , since those industries do n't receive money from the levy system .
The situation is less clear in other countries , like Canada , where the recording industry has apparently shot itself in the foot by getting exactly what it wanted .
Uploading files in Canada is infringement , just as in the US , but downloading files might not be .
That 's because the music business long ago convinced the government to slap a levy on various recording media , like blank CDs , to cover " private copying . "
The levy was not extended to " devices " like the iPod or the PC , however , even though they were certainly able to carry around copies of musical works .
The distinction between " media " and " devices " is crucial here , since Canadian courts have ruled that downloads are legal so long as the copies are made onto media that is covered by the private copying levy — not what the record industry envisioned when it had the levy passed .
Perhaps the most famous such decision was made back in 2004 by a federal appellate judge named Konrad von Finckenstein — who now happens to run Canada 's top telecoms regulator .
In a 2004 case on file - sharing , von Finckenstein ruled that " the downloading of a song for a person 's private use does not constitute infringement . "
He cited a section of Canada 's copyright law which says that copies of musical works downloaded " onto an audio recording medium for the private use of the person who makes the copy does not constitute an infringement of the copyright in the musical work , the performer 's performance or the sound recording . "
Note that the law applies only to a " medium , " not a device .
Furthermore , it applies only to music ; downloading video games or movies remains infringement , since those industries do n't receive money from the levy system .
Not that the major labels in Canada see it this way .
" Downloading pirated music is not legal in Canada , " wrote Richard Pfohl , the top lawyer for the Canadian Recording Industry Association , to a newspaper in June 2009 .
" The copyright law conclusions in the case he cites were overturned on appeal .
In fact , the Federal Court of Appeal has subsequently twice ruled that the private copying regime does n't apply to downloads made to hard drives . "
But as copyright lawyer Howard Knopf points out , the issue really remains the old " devices " vs. " media " distinction .
" The consistent thread of what the Copyright Board said in 2003 and the Federal Court of Appeal said in 2004 and 2008 is that downloading sound recordings onto something that is not an ' audio recording medium ' may be infringing , " he wrote .
So downloading music to an iPod or a computer 's internal hard drive might well be infringement , but Knopf argues that " an external plug and play hard drive that is clearly not in any sense ' embedded ' in anything and serves no function other than to be a large memory medium may very well be ' audio recording media . '
In that case , downloading any sound recording onto them obtained in any way from any source for private use would be legal in Canada , regardless of whether a levy has ever been sought from the Copyright Board . "
All clear ?
JERUSALEM ( CNN ) -- Israeli troops are accused in a newspaper article of harvesting organs from dead Palestinians , and Israel wants Sweden 's government to condemn the Swedish paper that published it .
Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman objects to an op - ed piece in a Swedish newspaper .
Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman compared the Swedish Foreign Ministry 's hands - off position to the country 's neutrality during World War II .
" It 's a shame that the Swedish Foreign Ministry fails to intervene in a case of blood libels against Jews , " Lieberman told Sweden 's ambassador to Israel on Thursday evening .
" This is reminiscent of Sweden 's stand during World War II , when [ it ] had failed to intervene as well . "
Lieberman plans to submit an official complaint about the matter to his Swedish counterpart , Carl Bildt , according to Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor .
The Swedish ambassador , Elisabet Borsiin Bonnier , rejected the article on Wednesday , a day after it was published in the newspaper Aftonbladet under the headline , " Our sons are being stripped of their organs . "
In her statement , Bonnier called it " as shocking and appalling to us Swedes as it is to Israeli citizens , " and noted that Sweden 's Embassy " cannot but clearly distance itself " from the report .
But Sweden 's Foreign Ministry refused to condemn the article , saying that Bonnier 's comments reflected the embassy 's position and not that of the Swedish government .
Both Bonnier and the ministry noted that Sweden has a free press -- which Bonnier said comes with " a certain responsibility " that " falls on the editor - in - chief of any given newspaper . "
" It 's a shame that after the Swedish ambassador to Israel did the right thing and condemned the report , clarifying that this newspaper does not represent Sweden in any way or form , the Swedish Foreign Ministry chose to dismiss her statement instead of supporting it , " Lieberman said .
" The meaning of freedom of press is the freedom to publish the truth , not the freedom to lie and slander .
A country which really wants to defend democratic values must strongly condemn false reports that reek of anti-Semitism like the one published this week by the Aftonbladet newspaper . "
Lieberman is also considering revoking Aftonbladet 's press credentials in Israel , spokesman Palmor said .
The article was an op - ed piece written by freelance journalist Donald Bostrom , who has traveled to the Middle East numerous times .
Bostrom , who spoke to CNN from Stockholm on Wednesday , said he wrote the piece in reaction to a recently unveiled corruption scandal in New Jersey that allegedly involved the private sale of a kidney from a donor in Israel .
Bostrom stressed that he has no proof that Israeli soldiers were stealing organs , and that the purpose of his opinion article was to call for an investigation into numerous claims in the 1990s that such activity was going on in the West Bank and Gaza .
He noted that the allegations came about after former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert -- then Israel 's health minister -- had embarked on a successful mission to increase the number of organ donors in the Jewish state .
His article centers on the case of Bilal Ahmed Ghanem , a 19 - year - old Palestinian man who was shot and killed in 1992 , allegedly by Israeli forces , in the West Bank village of Imatin .
Bostrom , who witnessed the man 's killing , said Ghanem was taken away alive by Israeli forces .
His body was returned five days later with a cut in his midsection that had been stitched up .
Ghanem 's family said they believed that his organs had been removed .
After that incident , at least 20 Palestinian families told Bostrom that they suspected the Israeli military had taken the organs of their sons after they had been killed by Israeli forces , and their bodies taken away -- presumably for routine autopsies .
Bostrom said he balanced those claims in his article by including a reaction from an Israeli military spokesman who told him that the Israel Defense Forces routinely carry out autopsies on Palestinians killed by their troops .
But , as he stated in his article , Bostrom said he has doubts about the necessity of the procedures if it is clear how the person died .
A United Nations account said that Ghanem 's death was investigated by the Israeli military , which concluded that Ghanem , who it said was 20 years old , " may have been killed when a group of reservists passing through the town opened fire in response to rocks being thrown at them . "
Bostrom said the newspaper has stood by its decision to publish his piece .
Speaking to CNN just hours after publication , he said he had received hundreds of messages asking him to recant his position , or worse .
" I have an e-mail here ... saying , ' The Nazis should die and you will be next .
We will meet you outside , you will be the next news very soon .
Meet you outside , ' " Bostrom said .
When asked if he was afraid , he said , " Yeah , I 'm concerned . "

It can only go uphill from this , right ?
Star Trek D - A - C got an upgrade to its systems for the release of the PlayStation 3 version , and we had a chance to check it out at Comic - con .
I could lay some fanboy bait and boldly say that the PlayStation 3 version is better than the Xbox 360 version , but somehow I do n't seen the flame catching .
Instead , I 'll just tell you about the changes , or better yet , let you see them for yourself in our video interview .
Among the improvements are changable difficulty levels and more setting options , but the biggest addition to Star Trek D - A - C is the PS3 - exclusive fourth ship group , a support type .
Unlike the fighter , bomber , and flagship , this support craft does n't have much offensive power .
Instead , think of it as a healer and a defensive assist .
This addition really changes the dynamic of the game completely , promoting more cooperative play .
You 'll have to protect that healer to survive .
How much better is D - A - C than the Xbox 360 version ?
We only played it for less than half an hour .
Let us give this new one a spin and we 'll tell you .
As for why the PS3 gets the fourth craft type and the Xbox 360 does n't , I 'll let you take that up with the devs .
I 'm sure they 'll update the Xbox 360 version , though .
WASHINGTON  Lenders are ramping up efforts to avoid home foreclosures , but a report by bank regulators says more than half of borrowers who get help fall behind again .
More than 50 % of homeowners with loans modified in the first half of last year had missed at least two months of payments a year later , the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision said Wednesday .
RELATED : Many mortgage modifications push payments .... higher
But the results were better among those who saw their payments drop substantially .
About one in three borrowers whose monthly payments were reduced 20 % or more had fallen behind again within a year .
That compares with more than 60 % for borrowers whose loan payments were left unchanged or increased .
The report highlights a significant challenge for the Obama administration 's plan to tackle the foreclosure crisis , backed by $ 50 billion in money from the financial industry bailout fund .
High rates of redefault have typically plagued loan modification programs , and critics argue that there is little point to modify loans that will fall into trouble again .
Officials in the Obama administration , however , counter that their plan requires the lending industry to make far more substantive changes — for example , reducing a borrower 's interest rate to as low as 2 % — than was common in the past .
The administration 's effort got off to a slow start , but has picked up speed in recent months .
As of last month , about 360,000 borrowers , or 12 % of those eligible , have signed up for three - month trial modifications .
They are supposed to be extended for five years if the homeowners make their payments on time .
There is currently no data on redefaults within the plan .
Traditionally , most lenders have offered payment plans that allowed borrowers to catch up on missed payments .
But those modifications often do not involve an interest rate reduction and result in a higher monthly payment .
But the bank regulators ' quarterly report shows that lenders were shifting their focus to modifications that reduced borrowers payments .
They made up nearly 80 % of new modifications in the April - June quarter , up from about half in the first three months of the year .
The report covers 34 million loans , representing more than 60 % of primary home mortgages .
Consistent with other reports , it showed borrowers are continuing to fall behind as job losses mount .
More than 11 % of borrowers covered by the report had missed at least one payment as of June 30 , up from 10 % in April .
It also highlighted mounting problems with an especially troubling category of loans — " pick - a - payment " or option ARM loans , which allowed borrowers to defer some of their interest payments and add them to the principal .
At the end of June , 10 % of these loans were in foreclosure , more than triple the rate for all mortgages in the survey .

The heart - on - sleeve indie rockers have said sorry for inadvertently helping to spawn a generation of miserable , eyeliner - wearing bands with not a song between them
Finally , someone has apologised for helping invent emo .
The Get Up Kids , the recently re-formed Missouri band that launched the soundtrack to 10 million eyeliner - wearing adolescences , have said that they are sorry .
" If this is the world we helped create , " guitarist James Suptic said , after looking into the crowd at a reunion gig , " then I apologise . "
The Get Up Kids were either second - or third - wave emo , depending on who you ask .
What is certain is that they formed in 1995 , released four albums , broke up in 2005 and reunited last year .
And yet their earnest , heart - on - sleeve punk pop inspired much of the more theatrical late - noughties emo boom .
" There should be a How to Be a Pop - Punk Kid Starter Kit with bands like the Get Up Kids , so kids would know whose shoulders bands like us are standing on , " Fall Out Boy 's Pete Wentz told Alternative Press in 2005 .
" Fall Out Boy would not be a band if it were not for the Get Up Kids . "
" Honestly , I do n't often think about the state of emo , " Suptic told Drowned in Sound .
" We played the Bamboozle fests this year and we felt really out of place .
I could name maybe three bands we played with .
It was just a sea of neon shirts to us ... the punk scene we came out of and the punk scene now are completely different .
It 's like glam rock now . "
While acts like Fall Out Boy pay tribute to Get Up Kids , the feeling is n't mutual .
" If a band gets huge and they say we inspired them – great , " Suptic said .
" The problem is most of them are n't very good .
What does that say about us ?
I do n't know .
Maybe we sucked . "
Aman Ali , a BoingBoing guest blogger , is the co-author of 30 Mosques , a Ramadan adventure taking him to a different mosque in New York City every day for a month .
My last post generated an interesting discussion ( 268 comments and counting ) on Muslim women covering their hair .
But it seemed kind of silly to talk about the subject , without hearing viewpoints from Muslim women .
My friend Mariam Sobh has graciously agreed to chime in .
She is editor in chief of Hijabtrendz , the original fashion beauty and entertainment blog for Muslim women .
Here 's what she had to say :
It 's the age old debate that quite frankly I 'm sick and tired of .
Muslim women and their " oppression " .
Oppression is such a loaded word and it conjures up all sorts of negative images , but what people do n't seem to want to understand is that Muslim women are just like any other woman .
We come in all shapes and sizes , and all sorts of beliefs .
You can't paint us all with the same brush .
I 'm as American as anyone else , I watch movies , I read celebrity gossip , I shop at Victoria 's Secret , I work outside the home , I 'm pursuing my dreams , the only difference is that little piece of fabric I wrap around my head .
Big whoop .
I 'm not harming anyone by wearing a piece of material on my head so what 's the big deal ?
I myself wear the headscarf and I do so because it 's something I believe is mandated in my religion .
No one is forcing me and it has no political significance ( I have no idea why people keep thinking it does ) .
Believe me if I did n't think it was required I WOULD NOT be wearing it .
I hate being bullied all the time by the press or some ignoramus about my scarf .
It takes a toll on you emotionally and eventually you have to develop a thick skin .
But words will always hurt no matter what .
James Montier ( via John Mauldin ) observes that the average holding period for New York Stock Exchange stocks is now down to six months .
We imagine this has something to do with the boom in high - frequency trading , in which stocks are sometimes held for all of six seconds .
But week - to - week performance benchmarking of professional fund managers probably has a lot to do with it , too .
In any event , can we please stop pretending that what most fund managers are doing every day is " investing " ?
Holding stocks for six months is n't investing .
It 's trading .
And because trading is a negative - sum game -- one largely focused on trying to figure out what everyone else is doing -- it is really speculating .
When you 're speculating , there 's no reason to pay attention to things like fundamental analysis , valuation , future cash flows , and all the other stuff they teach you in security - analysis school .
For holding periods of less than six months , those things do n't mean jack .
Over holding periods that short , the game is all about figuring out what everyone else thinks and then gambling that you 'll be right and they 'll be wrong .
So remember that next time your favorite fund manager sends you a note patting himself on the back for his investing prowess .
What he 's really talking about is speculating .

Analysts Can't Predict The Future
The German freighters were accompanied by Russian icebreakers Two German merchant ships are sailing from Asia to Europe via Russia 's Arctic coast , having negotiated the once impassable North East Passage .
This route is usually frozen but rising temperatures in the region caused by global warming have melted much of the ice allowing large ships to go through .
The North East passage has tempted mariners for hundreds of years .
In 1553 the British voyager Sir Hugh Willoughby died attempting to find the route .
The German ships Beluga Fraternity and Beluga Foresight arrived in the Siberian port of Yamburg , in the Ob river delta , on Monday , owner Beluga Shipping GmbH said on its website .
Both ships left South Korea in late July , negotiating the passage off north - eastern Siberia behind two Russian icebreakers .
" We are all very proud and delighted to be the first Western shipping company which has successfully transited the legendary North East Passage and delivered the sensitive cargo safely through this extraordinarily demanding sea area " , said Beluga CEO Niels Stolberg .
Retreating ice
The ships have been offloading some of their cargo .
Beluga spokeswoman Verena Beckhusen told AP that the Beluga Fraternity had already left to continue its journey via Murmansk to the Dutch port of Rotterdam .
The Foresight 's departure has been postponed until Saturday because of bad weather , she added .
But the once impenetrable ice that prevented ships travelling along the northern Russian coast has been retreating rapidly because of global warming in recent decades .
The passage became passable without ice breakers in 2005 .
By avoiding the Suez canal , the trip from Asia to Europe is shortened by almost 5,000 km ( 3,100 miles ) .
The company behind the enterprise says it is saving about $ 300,000 per vessel by using the northern route .
Both the Russian authorities and the German shippers are keen to prove the safety and efficiency of the passage , believing it could be a valuable commercial alternative to the Suez canal in summer .
Despite the rise in temperatures the route is still dangerous , with icebergs moving more freely in the warmer waters .
Scientists estimate that the last time that the North East Passage was as ice free as it is now was between 5,000 and 7,000 years ago .

This page used to document benchmark results which compared GraphicsMagick 1.3.8 performance to ImageMagick 6.5.8-10 performance .
We found that GraphicsMagick was usually considerably faster at executing image processing operations from the command line than ImageMagick 6.5.8 - 10 was .
One ImageMagick algorithm ran as much as 770 times slower .
GraphicsMagick clearly ran much more efficiently under Microsoft Windows .
We now find that a simple head to head performance comparison between GraphicsMagick and recent ImageMagick is no longer possible because ImageMagick has changed the meanings of the existing arguments .
In particular , we discovered that ImageMagick filter arguments producing convolution matrices are now producing lower - order convolution matrices representing perhaps an order of magnitude less work given the same arguments .
The resulting images are visually substantially less filtered .
Using the same command - line filter arguments causes GraphicsMagick to appear slower when it is actually doing far more work than ImageMagick .
Due to it not being feasable to do a head to head performance measurement between GraphicsMagick and ImageMagick , we have decided to not post results at the moment .
However , the strategy and a simple benchmark driver script are still provided for those who want to do their own performance comparisons between GraphicsMagick and ImageMagick .
The Eee PC T91 is n’t just the first touchscreen netbook from Asus .
It ’s also the company ’s smallest netbook to date .
While it sports an 8.9 inch , 1024 x 600 pixel touchscreen display , the T91 is actually a little smaller than the first generation Eee PC 701 , measuring just 8.9 ″ x 6.5 ″ x 1.1 ″ and weighing just about 2 pounds .
I do n’t happen to have an Eee PC 701 lying around , but I do have a handful of other netbooks and mini-laptops .
So I pulled out two 10 inch netbooks : my trusty Eee PC 1000H and a Lenovo IdeaPad S10 - 2 .
I also snapped a few photos of the T91 with the Lenovo IdeaPad S12 , which has a 12 inch screen .
These images serve both to show just how small the T91 is and how large the S12 is compared to a typical netbook .
You can find the images after the break .

At least five girls have been killed in a stampede at a state - run school in a crowded area of the Indian capital , Delhi , police and doctors say .
The stampede in Khajuri Khas area also injured 24 students .
Doctors say five of them are in a critical condition .
Officials said the stampede took place when a group of girl students , who tried to run down a narrow staircase , collided into a group of boys going up .
The school is waterlogged following a night of heavy rains in Delhi .
Earlier reports said the stampede was sparked by rumours that electric current had entered water due to a short - circuit .
But it has now emerged that the deaths occurred when students became jammed into a narrow school staircase .
" The exams were about to start when suddenly some boys came inside .
They pushed us and then we came out .
We were coming down the staircase when the stampede took place , " student Sanjana Gautam told the Press Trust of India news agency .
The wounded have been taken to Guru Teg Bahadur hospital .
The state authorities have ordered an inquiry into the incident .
" About 40 children were being moved from one section of the school to another , " news agency AFP quoted a police officer at the Khajuri Khas police station as saying .
Police have cordoned off the area and a huge crowd of anxious parents and local people has gathered outside the school .
Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit visited the injured children in the hospital .
OP Kalra , medical superintendent at the Guru Teg Bahadur hospital , said five of the injured students were critical .
He said the stampede occurred on a staircase in the school building .
The girls were writing an exam when they were asked to evacuate , Mr Kalra said and added that there were 1,300 to 1,400 students in the school at the time .
Angry relatives of students said there were only five to six teachers to evacuate the students .
The BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi says most government - run schools in India have poor infrastructure and they lack adequate staff .
She is called the Angel of Iran , because she lived her short life angelically .
The demonic Islamist Mullahs , true to their nature , could n't bear an angel in their midst .
On June 18 , 1983 , they hanged the young woman , barely past childhood , for refusing to renounce her belief : the belief in love , justice , and equality for all children of God .
Her name was
Mona
, a 17 - year old Baha'i Character School ( Sunday school ) teacher .
Her pupils loved the indescribably gentle loving teacher who taught them to grow up as exemplary humans with hearts brimming with the love of God , all his people and his creation .
One day the Mullahs ' agents came to her house while the young school - girl was studying for her next day English exam .
The savage Islamists had another much tougher exam in mind for her to be administered in the horrific prison of the Mullahs .
They were certain that they could break the frail young woman under pressure and torture ; that they could make her recant her faith and adopt their bigoted creed .
Our great Zoroaster , the luminous ancient prophet of Persia , spoke of the ongoing battle between the forces of good under Ahuramazda - God , and the forces of evil directed by Ahriman - the Satan .
Zoroaster warned us not to fall for the enticements or be deceived by the machinations of Ahriman .
He further informed us that evil can be recognized by the deeds of its people ; people who would oppose the precepts of Ahuramazda .
And the child - woman Mona was seen by the Islamist clergy as a threat to their very demonic precepts and practices .
They felt compelled to either convert her to their creed of darkness or extinguish her young life .
Mona , the young teacher , deeply loved children and believed that they had to be brought up as champion workers for Ahuramazda .
Baha 'is claim that the founder of their religion , Baha 'u ' llah , is the reappearance of the spirit of Zoroaster ; that Zoroaster 's triad teachings of Good Thoughts , Good Speech , and Good Behavior are elaborated in greater details by Baha 'u 'llah .
Mona 's lessons for the children , a detailed exposition of Zoroaster 's teachings , are summarized in the passage below by Baha 'u 'llah .
" Be generous in prosperity , and thankful in adversity .
Be worthy of the trust of thy neighbor , and look upon him with a bright and friendly face .
Be a treasure to the poor , an admonisher to the rich , an answerer to the cry of the needy , a preserver of the sanctity of thy pledge .
Be fair in thy judgment , and guarded in thy speech .
Be unjust to no man , and show all meekness to all men .
Be as a lamp unto them that walk in darkness , a joy to the sorrowful , a sea for the thirsty , a haven for the distressed , an upholder and defender of the victim of oppression .
Let integrity and uprightness distinguish all thine acts .
Be a home for the stranger , a balm to the suffering , and a tower of strength for the fugitive .
Be eyes to the blind , and a guiding light unto the feet of the erring .
Be an ornament to the countenance of truth , a crown to the brow of fidelity , a pillar of the temple of righteousness , a breath of life to the body of mankind , an ensign of the hosts of justice , a luminary above the horizon of virtue , a dew to the soil of the human heart , an ark on the ocean of knowledge , a sun in the heaven of bounty , a gem on the diadem of wisdom , a shining light in the firmament of thy generation , a fruit upon the tree of humility . "
Ten Baha'i women of Shiraz , Iran were among the many Baha 'is who were arrested by the Islamists for their faith .
The young Mona was one of them .
These women endured months of endless abuse in the prison of the Mullahs , yet every one of them refused under threat of death to recant their faith of love .
The heartless Mullahs finally decided to make good on their threat and hanged these magnificent human beings , one - by - one .
The Angel of Iran was the last to be hanged for she wished to pray for each woman as she was hanged .
When Mona 's turn came , she kissed the noose and placed it around her own neck with prayers on her lips .
The savage Islamists hanged the magnificent child - woman Mona after a long period of tortuous imprisonment .
By killing her , the agents of Ahriman aimed to kill love .
But assuredly they can never kill love .
They only kill the lover .
Oh , you earthly angels !
You immigrating birds ,
Whose only adornment
Is a bed of white feathers !
The innocent children of Iran ,
Are wearing your white glowing robe ,
And have left the memories of life ,
To others !
I see the poor black swallows ,
Flying over the ruins of our city !
I see overflowing pain ,
Intertwined ,
With the hearts of every Persian !
My heart stops palpitating !
My breath starts to dry up !
My faith simply fades away ,
And my bed falls silent .
Just to be safe , you should probably stop sniffing your dollar bills .
Especially if you live / work in the nation 's capital of politics .
A new -- and strange -- study by the American Chemical Society has just revealed that nine out of 10 pieces -- as in 90 % -- of the paper currency sampled around the United States recently contained traces of cocaine -- as in the illegal substance , which binds to the green ink .
Not surprisingly , the money was especially contaminated in bigger , more evil places like Detroit , Boston and Baltimore .
Also in Miami , Orlando and good old L.A .
All right around 100 % .
Mostly in $ 5s , $ 10s , $ 20s and $ 50s .
But get this :
The contamination was nearly as bad -- as in 95 % -- in Washington , D.C .
Now , we know why their workweeks are so short back there .
According to an ACS news release , the scientists studied banknotes from nearly three dozen cities in five countries -- the U.S. , Canada , Brazil , Japan and China .
The two North American countries showed the worst contamination , averaging between 85 % and 90 % .
Brazil 's was 80 % .
Toronto's was 88 % .
China ( 20 % ) and Japan ( 12 % ) had the cleanest bills .
The head of the study , Yuegang Zuo , of the University of Massachusetts , expressed surprise at the high rate of cocaine tainting .
He conducted a similar study two years ago and found a U.S. rate of " only " 67 % then .
Even bills not involved in drug deals can become contaminated during the automated bill - counting process in banks .
Zuo speculated that the apparent increased presence of cocaine was tied to difficult economic times , with more people experiencing stress and turning to the illegal drug .
He noted that the cocaine detected on the bills was usually a minute amount , presenting no direct health threat , unless it was used in active snorting -- as in rolled up -- or involved in direct proximity to drug deals .
So , with the exception of those bills employed in the snorting process , you probably do n't need to worry about being contaminated .
Still , if you ever encounter any drug - sniffing dogs , it 's probably best not to offer the canines a monetary tip .

bzr 2.0.0
#########
: 2.0.0 : 2009-09-22
: Codename : Instant Karma
This release of Bazaar makes the 2a ( previously ' brisbane - core ' ) format
the default when new branches or repositories are created .
This format is
substantially smaller and faster for many operations .
Most of the work in
this release focuses on bug fixes and stabilization , covering both 2a and
previous formats .
( See the Upgrade Guide for information on migrating
existing projects . )
This release also improves the documentation content and presentation ,
including adding Windows HtmlHelp manuals .
The Bazaar team decided that 2.0 will be a long - term supported release ,
with bugfix - only 2.0.x releases based on it , continuing for at least six
months or until the following stable release .
Changes from 2.0.0r c2 to final
******* ******* ******* ******* **
* Officially branded as 2.0.0 rather than 2.0 to clarify between things
that " want to happen on the 2.0.x stable series " versus things that want
to " land in 2.0.0 " .
( Changes how bzrlib . _format_ version_ tuple ( ) handles
micro = 0 . ) ( John Arbash Meinel )
bzr 2.0.0rc2
############
: 2.0.0rc2 : 2009-09-10
New Features
************
* Added post_commit hook for mutable trees .
This allows the keywords
plugin to expand keywords on files changed by the commit .
( Ian Clatworthy , # 408841 )
Bug Fixes
*********
* Bazaar 's native protocol code now correctly handles EINTR , which most
noticeably occurs if you break in to the debugger while connected to a
bzr+ssh server .
You can now can continue from the debugger ( by typing
' c ' ) and the process continues .
However , note that pressing C-\ in the
shell may still kill the SSH process , which is bug 162509 , so you must
sent a signal to the bzr process specifically , for example by typing
``kill - QUIT PID`` in another shell .
( Martin Pool , # 341535 )
* ``bzr check`` in pack - 0.92 , 1.6 and 1.9 format repositories will no
longer report incorrect errors about ``Missing inventory ( ' TREE_ROOT ' , ...)
``
( Robert Collins , # 416732 )
* ``bzr info -v`` on a 2a format still claimed that it was a " Development
format " ( John Arbash Meinel , # 424392 )
* ``bzr log stacked - branch`` shows the full log including
revisions that are in the fallback repository .
( Regressed in 2.0rc1 ) .
( John Arbash Meinel , # 419241 )
* Clearer message when Bazaar runs out of memory , instead of a ``MemoryError``
traceback .
( Martin Pool , # 109115 )
* Conversion to 2a will create a single pack for all the new revisions ( as
long as it ran without interruption ) .
This improves both ``bzr upgrade``
and ``bzr pull`` or ``bzr merge`` from local branches in older formats .
The autopack logic that occurs every 100 revisions during local
conversions was not returning that pack 's identifier , which resulted in
the partial packs created during the conversion not being consolidated
at the end of the conversion process .
( Robert Collins , # 423818 )
* Fetches from 2a to 2a are now again requested in ' groupcompress ' order .
Groups that are seen as ' underutilized ' will be repacked on - the - fly .
This means that when the source is fully packed , there is minimal
overhead during the fetch , but if the source is poorly packed the result
is a fairly well packed repository ( not as good as ' bzr pack ' but
good - enough . )
( Robert Collins , John Arbash Meinel , # 402652 )
* Fix a potential segmentation fault when doing ' log ' of a branch that had
ghosts in its mainline .
( Evaluating None as a tuple is bad . )
( John Arbash Meinel , # 419241 )
* Fix a segmentation fault when computing the ``merge_sort`` of a graph
that has a ghost in the mainline ancestry .
( John Arbash Meinel , # 419241 )
* ``groupcompress`` sort order is now more stable , rather than relying on
``topo_sort`` ordering .
The implementation is now
``KnownGraph . gc_sort` `. ( John Arbash Meinel )
* Local data conversion will generate correct deltas .
This is a critical
bugfix vs 2.0rc1 , and all 2.0rc1 users should upgrade to 2.0r c2 before
converting repositories .
( Robert Collins , # 422849 )
* Network streams now decode adjacent records of the same type into a
single stream , reducing layering churn .
( Robert Collins )
* Prevent some kinds of incomplete data from being committed to a 2 a
repository , such as revisions without inventories , a missing chk_bytes
record for an inventory , or a missing text referenced by an inventory .
( Andrew Bennetts , # 423506 , #406687 )
Documentation
*************
* Fix assertion error about " _remember_ remote_ is_before " when pushing to
older smart servers .
( Andrew Bennetts , # 418931 )
* Help on hooks no longer says ' Not deprecated ' for hooks that are
currently supported .
( Ian Clatworthy , # 422415 )
* PDF and CHM ( Windows HtmlHelp ) formats are now supported for the
user documentation .
The HTML documentation is better broken up into
topics .
( Ian Clatworthy )
* The developer and foreign language documents are now separated
out so that searching in the HTML and CHM files produces more
useful results .
( Ian Clatworthy )
* The main table of contents now provides links to the new Migration Docs
and Plugins Guide .
( Ian Clatworthy )
bzr 2.0.0rc1
############
: Codename : no worries
: 2.0.0rc1 : 2009-08-26
Compatibility Breaks
******* ******* ******
* The default format for bzr is now ``2a`` .
This format brings many
significant performance and size improvements .
bzr can pull from
any existing repository into a ``2 a`` one , but can only transfer
from ``2 a`` into ``rich - root`` repositories .
The Upgrade guide
has more information about this change .
( Robert Collins )
* On Windows auto -detection of Putty 's plink . exe is disabled .
Default SSH client for Windows is paramiko .
User still can force
usage of plink if explicitly set environment variable BZR_SSH=plink .
( #414743 , Alexander Belchenko )
New Features
************
* ``bzr branch -- switch`` can now switch the checkout in the current directory
to the newly created branch .
( Lukáš Lalinský )
Bug Fixes
*********
* Fetches were being requested in ' groupcompress ' order , but were n't
recombining the groups .
Thus they would ' fragment ' to get the correct
order , but not ' recombine ' to actually benefit from it .
Until we get
recombining to work , switching to ' unordered ' fetches avoids the
fragmentation .

The Jerusalem Post has given me a new theme : Israel 's delegitimization is reaching American culture in a whole new way .
I first heard this pronouncement at AIPAC , from Howard Kohr , who gave a Shakespearean speech saying that a " Predicate for Abandonment " of Israel had taken hold every where but in the councils of power in Washington– so AIPAC members had to stop it there .
Now JPost is getting the news , interviewing U.S. professors who say Israel 's image is changing rapidly and Israelis and the lobby are in denial .
From the JPost , here is Nina Tannenwald of Brown :
" I 've been struck by the way the Israeli self - narrative of a besieged underdog , no longer resonates to outside observers , " she said .
" That was a narrative that I think had a lot of truth earlier on in Israel 's history , but I think there 's a widespread perception that that self - narrative does n't resonate with the outside world , given that Israel is now the world 's 14th or 15th most powerful military country , " she continued .
" And so there 's a disconnect between how Israelis see themselves in their situation , and how observers outside see it , and that is a disconnect that needs addressing . "
… " I think there is a common theme among Israelis [ that says ] , ' We 're a small country , we 're the only democracy in the Middle East , look at all these Islamic countries around us , ' and we know that trope very well .
I think there are more nuanced analyses among Israelis , but there is a dominant trope among the government leadership , among the traditional , very strong pro-Israel supporters in the United States , where this [ underdog ] narrative dominates , and I think it needs to be updated . "
It would be nice if one person in the article had said simply to the Israelis , this is not some meta- , postmodern paradigm shift .
It is based on real conditions .
And when you slaughter 300 children , there are real consequences .
Now here 's the latest evidence .
ATime Magazine piece by Tim McGirk from Jerusalem on the mistreatment of children in Israeli prisons that may well violate UN conventions .
Walid 's story is hardly unusual , judging from a report on the
Israeli military - justice system in the West Bank compiled by the
Palestine office of the Geneva - based Defense for Children International , which works closely with the U.N. and European states .
Human - rights groups in Israel
and elsewhere have also condemned the punishment meted out to
Palestinian children by Israeli military justice .
Most onerous , says
Sarit Michaeli of the Israeli human - rights group B'Tselem , is that
inside the territories , the Israeli military deems any Palestinian who
is 16 years and older as an adult , while inside Israel , the U.S. and
most other countries , adulthood is reached at age 18 .
The
report states that " the ill - treatment and torture " of Palestinian child
prisoners " appears to be widespread , systematic and institutionalized ,
suggesting complicity at all levels of the political and military chain of command . "
The group 's director , Rifaat Kassis , says the number of child arrests
rose sharply in the past six months , possibly because of a crackdown on
Palestinian protests in the West Bank in the aftermath of Israel's
military offensive in Gaza .

After setting a new standard for Lack of Class in an FPS with the addition of Jarate ( the jar - based Karate ) , we 've raised the bar on lowering the tone even further with the first ever Classless Update !
Also , if you have n't seen them yet , ubercharged .
net is currently up to part three in a nine - part series covering how each TF2 class is used in competitive matches .
It 's a fantastic read if you want to get some insight into the strategies of TF2's most skilled players .
PARENTS are to be given the right to make a formal complaint about the fact they are raising a little shit .
Announcing the strategy , schools secretary Ed Balls said the new ' Home - School Agreements ' will signal a step - change in the total abandonment of parental responsibility .
He added : " The agreements , to be signed by all teachers , could be used in disciplinary action against them if the six - foot teenage lunatics in their care keep trying to shove a chair leg into the school janitor .
" It will also give parents the opportunity to complain about other parents who are less strict , diligent and , on the whole , less middle class than they are . "
Jack Bradford , whose overbearing mother Gemma cannot wait to start complaining , said : " She 's going to be there every five minutes reporting all the psychopaths in my year .
But it 's not her that 's going to be made to eat her own phone , is it ? "
Nikki Hollis , a mother - of - at - least - eight , from Doncaster said : " They keep sending me these parenting orders but as I have explained , time and time again , I did not get the best education so it just looks like a lot of squiggles to me .
" The main thing is that after blaming CBeebies and Sunny Delight , I can , at long last , force the school to deal with his violent mood swings , his antique knife collection and his persistent arson . "
She added : " By the way , have you seen that stuck - up bitch Gemma Bradford anywhere ? "
" Our motive was not to suppress people going to participate in the festival but to reform them and educate them .
We have succeeded in the sense that the use of liquor by the participants was almost negligible and they did not use slings to pelt stones or the injuries would have been on a larger scale . "
When this report comes out , the media will turn their focus toward us to see if we 're financially strong enough to win this election .
It 's extremely important that we demonstrate that the NO on 1 campaign has strong support .
As Maine voters begin turning out to the polls during the early voting period , it 's important that the story coming out about the campaign is positive and shows momentum .
From the beginning , we knew we'd be waging an uphill battle against the millions of dollars being poured into our opposition 's campaign by national anti-equality groups .
However , every time they 've attacked marriage equality , our campaign has been able to respond to their lies and misinformation , and reinforce our message of respect and fairness for all Maine families .
But we can't keep doing that without your help .
Let 's double the $ 4,733 already raised on Orange to Blue .
As we had seen in California , the No on Prop 8 campaign was ahead in September , too -- by as much as 14 points .
But it was those undecided voters who ended up delivering victory to the anti-equality Yes on 8 campaign .
We are n't going to let that happen , but we need the resources to execute our campaign plan .
We can't forget what 's at stake .
It 's hard to top Bill in Portland Maine this morning :
But to Maine 's same - sex couples --- many who 've been together for decades and / or are raising families --- it 's much more than that .
It 's an elevation from second - class status to equal status .
It 's official recognition by the state that gay spouses and their families deserve the same benefits , services and protections across the board as straight spouses so they can more easily navigate life 's little ( and not so little ) twists and turns .
And , dammit , it 's about being given the opportunity to summon the courage it takes to join the institution of marriage with all its obligations and responsibilities .
This stuff about gay people wanting to " redefine " marriage is horse hockey .
Give what ever you can to help push us over the top .
Our email list just blew past our $ 40,000 goal on ActBlue .
Can kossacks step up now to double the $ 4,733 on the Orange to Blue page ?
Update [ 2009-9-30 14:33:25 by Jesse Connolly ] :
We hit the recommend list and are at exactly , $ 5,000 .
Can we make it to $ 9,466 ?
Keep it going !
Update [ 2009-9-30 17:57:42 by Jesse Connolly ] : We are at $ 6,127.02 !
Thanks for all of the recommends and contributions .
The Invariant Set Postulate differentiates between reality and unreality , suggesting the existence of a state space , within which a smaller subset of state space ( reality ) is embedded .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Since the early days of quantum mechanics , scientists have been trying to understand the many strange implications of the theory : superpositions , wave - particle duality , and the observer ’s role in measurements , to name a few .
Now , a new proposed law of physics that describes the geometry of physical reality on the cosmological scale might help answer some of these questions .
Plus , the new law could give some clues about the role of gravity in quantum physics , possibly pointing the way to a unified theory of physics .
Tim Palmer , a weather and climate researcher at the European Centre for Medium - Range Weather Forecasts in Reading , UK , has been interested in the idea of a new geometric framework for quantum theory for a long time .
Palmer ’s doctoral thesis was in general relativity theory at Oxford University in the late 1970s .
His studies convinced him that a successful quantum theory of gravity requires some geometric generalization of quantum theory , but at the time he was unsure what specific form this generalization should take .
Over the years , Palmer ’s professional research moved away from this area of theoretical physics , and he is now one of the world ’s experts on the predictability of climate , a subject which has considerable input from nonlinear dynamical systems theory .
In a return to his original quest for a realistic geometric quantum theory , Palmer has applied geometric thinking inspired by such dynamical systems theory to propose the new law , called the Invariant Set Postulate , described in a recent issue of the Proceedings of the Royal Society A .
As Palmer explained to PhysOrg.com , the Invariant Set Postulate is proposed as a new geometric framework for understanding the basic foundations of quantum physics .
" Crucially , the framework allows a differentiation between states of physical reality and physical ' unreality , ' " he said .
The theory suggests the existence of a state space ( the set of all possible states of the universe ) , within which a smaller ( fractal ) subset of state space is embedded .
This subset is dynamically invariant in the sense that states which belong on this subset will always belong to it , and have always belonged to it .
States of physical reality are those , and only those , which belong to this invariant subset of state space ; all other points in state space are considered “ unreal . ”
Such points of unreality might correspond to states of the universe in which counterfactual measurements are performed in order to answer questions such as “ what would the spin of the electron have been , had my measuring apparatus been oriented this way , instead of that way ? ”
Because of the Invariant Set Postulate , such questions have no definite answer , consistent with the earlier and rather mysterious notion of “ complementarity ” introduced by Niels Bohr .
According to Palmer , quantum mechanics is not itself sufficiently complete to determine whether a point in state space lies on the invariant set , and indeed neither is any algorithmic extension to quantum theory .
As Palmer explains , in quantum theory , states associated with these points of unreality can only be described by abstract mathematical expressions which have the algebraic form of probability but without any underlying sample space .
It is this which gives quantum theory its rather abstract mathematical form .
As well as being able to provide an understanding of the notion of complementarity , the two - fold ontological nature of state space can also be used to explain one of the long - standing mysteries of quantum theory : superpositions .
According to the Invariant Set Postulate , the reason that Schrodinger ’s cat seems to be both alive and dead simultaneously is not because it is , in reality , in two states at once , but rather because quantum mechanics is ignorant of the intricate structure of the invariant set which determines the notion of reality .
Whichever point ( alive or dead ) lies on the invariant set , that one is real .
The notion of quantum coherence , which is reflected in the concept of superposition , is , rather , carried by the self - similar geometry of the invariant set .
With superposition seemingly resolved from the perspective of the Invariant Set Postulate , other aspects of quantum mechanics can also be explained .
For instance , if states are not in superpositions , then making a measurement on the quantum system does not “ collapse the state ” of the system .
By contrast , in Palmer ’s framework , a measurement merely describes a specific quasi-stationary aspect of the geometry of the invariant set , which in turn also informs us humans about the invariant set .
The Invariant Set Postulate appears to reconcile Einstein ’s view that quantum mechanics is incomplete , with the Copenhagen interpretation that the observer plays a vital role in defining the very concept of reality .
Hence , consistent with Einstein ’s view , quantum theory is incomplete since it is blind to the intricate structure of the invariant set .
Yet consistent with the Copenhagen interpretation , the invariant set is in part characterized by the experiments that humans perform on it , which is to say that experimenters do indeed play a key role in defining states of physical reality .
Yet another quantum mechanical concept that the Invariant Set Postulate may resolve is wave - particle duality .
In the two - slit experiment , a world where particles travel to areas of destructive interference simply does not lie on the invariant set , and therefore does not correspond to a state of physical reality .
Among the remaining mysteries of quantum mechanics that the Invariant Set Postulate might help explain is the role of gravity in quantum physics .
As Palmer notes , gravity has sometimes been considered as an objective mechanism for the collapse of a superposed state .
However , since the Invariant Set Postulate does not require superposed states , it does not require a collapse mechanism .
Rather , Palmer suggests that gravity plays a key role in defining the state space geometry of the invariant set .
This idea fits with Einstein ’s view that gravity is a manifestation of geometry .
As such , Palmer suggests , unifying the concepts of non-Euclidean causal space - time geometry and the fractal atemporal geometry of state space could lead to the long - sought theory of “ quantum gravity . ”
Such a theory would be very different from previous approaches , which attempt to quantize gravity within the framework of standard quantum theory .
Palmer ’s paper is an exploratory analysis of this Invariant Set Postulate , and he now hopes to develop his ideas into a rigorous physical theory .
Just as global space - time geometric methods transformed our understanding of classical gravitational physics in the 1960s , Palmer hopes that the introduction of global state space geometric methods could give scientists a deeper understanding of quantum gravitational physics .
And , as suggested above , combining these two types of geometry might help lead to the long - sought unified theory of physics .

Hace una semana publiqué en este espacio que el presidente Felipe Calderón está pensando pagar 60 millones de dólares por un espectáculo del Bicentenario que se presentará una sola vez , una noche , en el Zócalo .
Las reacciones de los lectores me sorprendieron .
Recupero algunas : “ ¡ Una vez cada 200 años no hace daño !... ¿ a ver quién de aquí no se ha gastado su último sueldo en cervezas , en armar la pachanga con la familia y olvidarse de todo ? ”
Otro más apela al animo derrochador del mexicano para justificarlo : “ Los mexicanos así somos , la fiesta de los 15 años de la hija , el bautizo o la boda son motivo para echar la casa por la ventana a pesar de no contar con los recursos económicos ” .
Y por último otro más nos recuerda que el despilfarro es tradición en los pueblos : “ En mi rancho cuando llegan los 15 años de la niña , aunque no haya dinero ni para el pago del recibo de la luz , de todas formas se hace fiesta , y no sólo eso , se echa la casa por la venta , todo , claro , a costillas de muchos padrinos , de vestido , de música , de pastel , de comida , de invitaciones , de mariachi , de video , de peinado , de bebida y sin faltar los padrinos de palillos , popotes y servilletas .
¡ Así somos los mexicanos ! ”
No por ser nuestro lo tradicional es bueno .
Conozco bien el caso de Santa Rosa de Lima , un pueblo mixteco de Oaxaca .
En Santa Rosa no se produce nada y la mayoría de su población ha tenido que emigrar .
Algunos viven en el Distrito Federal , la mayoría esta en Oregon , en Estados Unidos .
Eso no impide que cada año , del 28 al 31 de agosto se festeje en grande en Santa Rosa .
Todos están invitados , los del pueblo y los que lleguen de los alrededores .
Para atenderlos y darles el recibimiento que merecen , se designa a un mayordomo y a 66 encargados de la fiesta .
Cada uno de esos 66 aporta 6 mil pesos en efectivo , tres guajolotes , seis pollos y para tortillas y refrescos .
Un promedio de 12 mil pesos por persona , un total de 792 mil pesos .
Y así , cada año , desde hace décadas .
Le pregunto a un nativo si no hay remedio , sino se puede invertir ese dinero en proyectos productivos que permitan que los jóvenes no se tengan que ir .
— Habrá que esperar a que los mayores se mueran , antes es imposible , es la tradición — me responde .
¡ Qué precio tan alto por mantener la identidad y la cohesión !
No , lo mexicano no puede ser el despilfarro , el jolgorio y la autodestrucción .
Tenemos mucho más .
Nadie propone una austeridad extrema , ni la amargura como lema , pero justificar que hoy en México se destinen 60 millones de dólares para una fiesta es perpetuar a lo grande el pecado de Santa Rosa de Lima .
Ramallah , West Bank
Ever since the collapse of the Oslo peace accords in 2000 , and the horror - show violence that followed , there has been only one thing to say about the West Bank : Nothing ever changes here , except for the worst .
That is just not the case anymore  much to my surprise .
For Palestinians , long trapped between burgeoning Israeli settlements and an Israeli occupation army , subject to lawlessness in their own cities and the fecklessness of their own political leadership , life has clearly started to improve a bit , thanks to a new virtuous cycle : improved Palestinian policing that has led to more Palestinian investment and trade that has led to the Israeli Army dismantling more checkpoints in the West Bank that has led to more Palestinian travel and commerce .
Because the West Bank today is largely hidden from Israelis by a wall , Israelis are just starting to learn from their own press what is going on there .
On July 31 , many Israelis were no doubt surprised to read this quote in the Maariv daily from Omar Hashim , deputy chairman of the Chamber of Commerce of Nablus , the commercial center of the West Bank : “ Traders here are satisfied , ” said Hashim .
“ Their sales are rising .
They feel that life is returning to normal .
There is a strong sense of optimism . ”
Make no mistake : Palestinians still want the Israeli occupation to end , and their own state to emerge , tomorrow .
That is not going to happen .
But for the first time since Oslo , there is an economic - security dynamic emerging on the ground in the West Bank that has the potential  the potential  to give the post - Yasir Arafat Palestinians another chance to build the sort of self - governing authority , army and economy that are prerequisites for securing their own independent state .
A Palestinian peace partner for Israel may be taking shape again .
While there is certainly more to testing than unit testing , and more to a well - rounded approach to development than just testing , a failure to appreciate the role and practice of unit testing can lead to disappointment or a skewed notion of testing as a programmer ’s responsibility .
This session aims to look at some issues , examples and counterexamples that help to highlight some of the problems and offer some solutions .
Left 4 Dead ( L4D ) is a new action title from Valve , creators of the Counter - Strike and Half - Life games , and promises to redefine the co-operative genre as those titles did for multiplayer and single player action games .
Set in a modern day survival - horror universe , the co-operative gameplay of L4D casts four " Survivors " in an epic struggle against hordes of swarming zombies and terrifying " Boss Infected " mutants .
Valve ’s next generation AI technology , allows for games of 1 to 8 players .
Players can play as a Survivor or as one of four types of " Boss Infected , " each of whom possess a unique mutant ability such as a 50 - foot tongue lasso or a giant belly full of explosive methane gas .
The gameplay takes place across four massive campaigns .
The " zombie " population of each mission is choreographed by an " AI Director " that monitors the human players ’ actions and creates a unique and dramatic experience for them on the fly .
Set in the immediate aftermath of the highly - anticipated zombie apocalypse , Left 4 Dead features single player , multiplayer and co-operative gameplay modes .
Next - generation artificial intelligence tailors the pacing and difficulty ensuring a different experience every time the game is played .
Entitled " Crash Course , " the latest DLC delivers new single - player , multiplayer and co-operative gameplay to both platforms .
Targeted for release in September , " Crash Course " bridges the gap between the end of the " No Mercy " campaign and the beginning of " Death Toll " in the original game , expanding the game universe with new locations , new dialogue from the original cast , and an explosive finale
While containing both Survival maps and a Co-operative Campaign , the primary goal of " Crash " is to deliver a complete Versus mode experience in just 30 minutes , resulting in a streamlined version of the game 's existing Versus campaigns .
A recharge timer for infected teammates has also been added , and item spawn behavior has changed for more balanced gameplay .
" Since the release of Left 4 Dead last November , the design team has been excited about creating new experiences for this world and allowing players to do the same , by releasing much of our internal toolset , like the Survival Pack and Authoring Tools , " said Gabe Newell .
" We 're working with the fans toward the ongoing entertainment value of the product . "
Left 4 Dead : Crash Course is targeted for release in September and will be available free of charge on the PC and for 560 Gamer points on Xbox Live .

We have to survive each other
A child stares oblivious to the adults
busily washing clothes in the one for
all well or those who are playing
tong - its  behind her .
As of this writing , the world ’s population is about 6.8 B .
In our country alone , primary statistical agency of the government National Statistics Office ( NSO ) projects that this year ’s population will reach 92.23 M .
This means that the Philippine population will reach over 140 million by the year 2040 according to the final results from the 2000 census - based population projects .
As the world population grows , it is inevitable that WE HAVE TO SURVIVE EACH OTHER .
There is just no denying that the impact of a growing population is a universal problem .
Taking turns when there is only one well .
Why so ?
This is because according to a research presented during the American Association for the Advancement of Science , “ as the world population continues to grow geometrically , great pressure is being placed on arable land , water , energy , and biological resources to provide an adequate supply of food while maintaining the integrity of our ecosystem .
According to the World Bank and the United Nations , from 1 to 2 billion humans are now malnourished , indicating a combination of insufficient food , low incomes , and inadequate distribution of food .
This is the largest number of hungry humans ever recorded in history .
In China about 80 million are now malnourished and hungry .
Based on current rates of increase , the world population is projected to double from roughly 6 billion to more than 12 billion in less than 50 years . ”
A little girl happily holds some coins

Villa Beach .
True , this may sound highfaluting but this is the reality .
Each day , we count how many children will be born with a dim future because of lack of proper information that every woman has a choice .
Our women and even their husbands or partners can still do something by deciding to limit or space pregnancies .
Access to voluntary family planning and reproductive health services are readily available in government agencies like Department of Health ( DOH ) , Commission on Population ( POPCOM ) , service health providers in barangays or municipalities and other partner non-governmental organizations ( NGO’s ) .
A growing population has already become alarming but if population will continue to grow significantly , the effect will be devastating .
Imagine when every person is fighting for the most basic need according to Maslow ’s hierarchy which is food .
It already happened in China and other parts of the world .
In our country , the National Statistical Coordination Board ( NSCB ) reported in 2006 that 33 out of 100 Filipinos are poor .
The severity of poverty in the Philippines needs no photos to show anybody .
“ Res ipsa loquitor . ”
Indeed , one can just take a jeepney and see the shanties mushrooming near the rivers , creeks or just about anywhere .
Malnourished children would play along the road like it was their playground .
An old man is not spared from fetching a
pail of water .
In some depressed communities , there is only one well where everybody can get water in order to bathe , drink and wash clothes .
Worse , in this day and age of civilization , there are still rural and far - flung areas where they have to walk miles in order to get water .
Children have to stop studying or be told not to study at all because there is just not enough money to spend .
Some are pushed by their own parents to work .
Four years ago in Brgy .
San Jose , Arevalo , Iloilo City , the Educational Research and Development Assistance ( ERDA ) Foundation adopted some children who used to be child labourers to be their beneficiaries .
This program by ERDA is commendable .
ERDA has over 19,000 beneficiaries enrolled in different levels of education all over the country .
Its programs enlist school dropouts , child scavengers , street children , out of school youth , child laborers , children in conflict with the law , children of persons afflicted by leprosy and children of indigenous people .
ERDA ’s educational assistance programs are available from pre-school up to college .
Since its inception , ERDA has come to the aid of over 600,000 indigent children all over the country .
ERDA gives free uniform and school supplies to their beneficiaries as well as miscellaneous fees for elementary and high school students who used to be children working in hazardous fireworks factory in Arevalo .
Barangay Health Woker ( BHW ) Anabelle Indencio and Barangay Nutrition Scholar ( BNS ) Noreen Abada share that there are many communities with malnourished children because of poor health practices in the areas of these affected children .
Indencio futher explains that the problem is the congestion and the over - crowdedness of the houses which makes it dangerous to public health especially to children .
Abada on the other hand expressed that there are only 9 malnourished children in Brgy .
San Jose at the moment .
This is because they closely monitor the children weighing them if they have the expected weight according to their age .
But she said that it is also difficult to expect that because these children come from poor families and they do not get the proper nutrition from their food intake .
There is still time to act .
Empowering our women that spacing and limiting pregnancies is a good choice is the first step if our women want to do their share .

From what I understand , the vast majority of the aluminum absorbed by the body comes from food , not from deodorants or anti-persperants .
See , aluminum is the third most common element on earth and is the most common metal - as such it is n't surprising to learn that just about every organic creature contains some aluminum .
That 's right , every time you eat a plant or an animal you are ingesting aluminum .
The kidneys happen to be very good at removing aluminum ( again , not surprising , since aluminum bonds to ammonia , and ammonia is found in urea - the major constituent of urine ) .
So , like any other mineral , what aluminum is not required by the body is flushed .
Like just about every other medical topic , however , the issue is always up for debate .
The human body is essentially an absurdly complex chemical reaction , and understanding each component 's function and potential malfunction is never easy and rarely ( if ever ) completely understood .
That said , after 40 years of study the link between aluminum and disease has only gotten weaker , not stronger - such that it lives on primarily as folk wisdom , not sound medical doctrine .
tl ; dr : Like a great many topics of folk wisdom , fears of aluminum in anything but very large quantities are almost certainly unfounded .
Wind power is lowering the cost of electricity in Texas , and hurting some utilities ' margins , says Bernstein Research , via Environmental Capital .
Wind is a cheaper alternative than natural gas fired turbines to cover some demand .
As more wind power blows in Texas , less natural gas is needed says Bernstein :
[ A]t hours of relatively low power demand , it will no longer be necessary to dispatch high cost gas fired generators to meet the prevailing load ; rather , the system ’s wind , nuclear and coal fired power plants will be sufficient to meet demand .
As power prices are set by the variable cost of operation of the last unit dispatched , wind can have a material impact on the price of power .
The effects of this are varied , says Tom Benning at Environmental Capital .
He indicates that it means natural gas prices , which are already low , will slump further as demand decreases .
Also , he highlights this from Berstein , " The growth of wind power in ERCOT over the next three years will markedly lower the consumption of gas and coal by conventional generators . "
According to Bernstein this puts Energy Future Holdings ( formerly TXU ) , NRG Energy and PNM Resources at the most risk due to falling margins .

This is even funnier because it actually happened .
And speaking of Cognitive Dissonance , Daily Kos noticed the recent upswing of people who are claiming to be Libertarians while acting otherwise , so they published a handy - dandy guide to the “ Top 10 Signs You Might Not Be A Libertarian “ .
My favorite is :
Spotted at Calhoun 's in April 2009 .
A kid's menu featured the " Crazy Maze " , which was apparently supposed to be difficult .
Amazing how some people have the silly notion that rightwing hate in this country might be something to worry about :
The Southern Baptist Convention , the nation ’s largest denomination , has been embarrassed by the comments of the Rev. Wiley Drake , a former officer in the convention , who said he is praying for the death of the president .
Drake , a former SBC vice president who ran for president last year , said in a recent interview on Fox News Radio that he is praying an “ imprecatory prayer ” against the president .
Those are prayers that ask for evil or misfortune .
Asked if he was seriously praying that the president of the United States would die , Drake said , “ If he does not turn to God and does not turn his life around , I am asking God to enforce imprecatory prayers that are throughout the Scripture that would cause him death , that ’s correct . ”
Americans United for the Separation of Church and State had this to say :
OAKLAND , Calif . -- Ken Griffey Jr. sure seems like someone who wants to stick around the Seattle Mariners for another season .
" If it works out for both sides , I 'm fine , " Griffey told The Associated Press before the Mariners opened a four - game series against the Oakland Athletics on Thursday night .
" We 'll figure it out at the end of the year .
We 've still got 30 days . "
Griffey is as happy as he 's been in years , back where he began his 21 - year big league career in 1989 and is still beloved despite leaving for nearly nine seasons with the Cincinnati Reds .
He believes he can still produce .
While Griffey wo n't go as far as to say he 's leaning toward playing in 2010 , he'd be game for another year in Seattle if the situation was right for both himself and the club .
And as long as his body holds up , of course .
The 39 - year - old Griffey returned to the lineup as the designated hitter batting in the cleanup spot against Oakland after missing six games with inflammation in his left knee .
He entered with a .221 batting average , 14 homers and 43 RBIs .
Griffey said he has always waited until the end of a season to evaluate things and make decisions , discussing the future with his wife and kids , too .
And this year wo n't be any different , even when he faces constant questions about whether this year might be the last in his decorated career .
Griffey is amused by the constant speculation of will he or wo n't he ?
That 's just what happens when you spent 11 seasons as the face of a franchise then came back for another go .
He has brought a spirit and energy back to Safeco Field this season .
" They all want to know , " Griffey said with a smile .
The slugger said his representatives have had preliminary talks with the Mariners and another meeting would take place soon after the season ends .
Griffey was an All - Star in each of his final 10 seasons in Seattle until he got the trade he asked for to Cincinnati in 2000 .
He rejoined the Mariners in February , signing a one - year contract worth $ 2 million , plus a possible $ 3 million in incentives .
This club certainly has appreciated Griffey 's leadership and veteran presence in the clubhouse .
He dug his fingers into Ichiro Suzuki 's armpits Thursday while the star leadoff hitter was on the floor doing his array of stretches .
" This is easy , " Junior said .
" He has no body fat .
He 's all muscle and ribs . "
" Ahhhh , " Suzuki laughed .
" Please .
... You are the master ! "
Later , Griffey made the rounds behind the batting cage to offer handshakes and hugs to members of the A's .
The Coliseum is the spot where he picked up his first career hit in his major league debut , on April 3 , 1989 .
He has enjoyed his role as a mentor for the young players and believes this franchise is close to turning the corner .
" I want to be part of this , " he said .
" We 're building something . "
Markdown : Syntax
Note :
This document is itself written using Markdown ; you can see the source for it by adding ‘. text ’ to the URL .
Overview
Philosophy
Markdown is intended to be as easy - to - read and easy - to - write as is feasible .
Readability , however , is emphasized above all else .
A Markdown - formatted document should be publishable as - is , as plain text , without looking like it ’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions .
While Markdown ’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text - to - HTML filters — including Setext , atx , Textile , reStructuredText , Grutatext , and EtText — the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown ’s syntax is the format of plain text email .
To this end , Markdown ’s syntax is comprised entirely of punctuation characters , which punctuation characters have been carefully chosen so as to look like what they mean .
E.g. , asterisks around a word actually look like * emphasis * .
Markdown lists look like , well , lists .
Even blockquotes look like quoted passages of text , assuming you ’ve ever used email .
Inline HTML
Markdown ’s syntax is intended for one purpose : to be used as a format for writing for the web .
Markdown is not a replacement for HTML , or even close to it .
Its syntax is very small , corresponding only to a very small subset of HTML tags .
The idea is not to create a syntax that makes it easier to insert HTML tags .
In my opinion , HTML tags are already easy to insert .
The idea for Markdown is to make it easy to read , write , and edit prose .
HTML is a publishing format ; Markdown is a writing format .
Thus , Markdown ’s formatting syntax only addresses issues that can be conveyed in plain text .
For any markup that is not covered by Markdown ’s syntax , you simply use HTML itself .
There ’s no need to preface it or delimit it to indicate that you ’re switching from Markdown to HTML ; you just use the tags .
The only restrictions are that block - level HTML elements — e.g. < div > , < table > , < pre > , < p > , etc. — must be separated from surrounding content by blank lines , and the start and end tags of the block should not be indented with tabs or spaces .
Markdown is smart enough not to add extra ( unwanted ) < p > tags around HTML block - level tags .
For example , to add an HTML table to a Markdown article :
This is a regular paragraph .
< table > < tr> < td> Foo</td > </tr> </table >
This is another regular paragraph .
Note that Markdown formatting syntax is not processed within block - level HTML tags .
E.g. , you ca n’t use Markdown - style * emphasis * inside an HTML block .
Span -level HTML tags — e.g. < span > , < cite > , or < del > — can be used anywhere in a Markdown paragraph , list item , or header .
If you want , you can even use HTML tags instead of Markdown formatting ; e.g. if you ’d prefer to use HTML < a > or < img > tags instead of Markdown ’s link or image syntax , go right ahead .
Unlike block - level HTML tags , Markdown syntax is processed within span - level tags .
Automatic Escaping for Special Characters
In HTML , there are two characters that demand special treatment : < and & .
Left angle brackets are used to start tags ; ampersands are used to denote HTML entities .
If you want to use them as literal characters , you must escape them as entities , e.g. < , and & .
Ampersands in particular are bedeviling for web writers .
If you want to write about ‘ AT&T ’ , you need to write ‘ AT&T ’.
You even need to escape ampersands within URLs .
Thus , if you want to link to :
http://images.google.com/images?num=30&q=larry+bird
you need to encode the URL as :
http://images.google.com/images?num=30&q=larry+bird
in your anchor tag href attribute .
Needless to say , this is easy to forget , and is probably the single most common source of HTML validation errors in otherwise well - marked - up web sites .
Markdown allows you to use these characters naturally , taking care of all the necessary escaping for you .
If you use an ampersand as part of an HTML entity , it remains unchanged ; otherwise it will be translated into & .
So , if you want to include a copyright symbol in your article , you can write :
©
and Markdown will leave it alone .
But if you write :
AT&T
Markdown will translate it to :
AT&T
Similarly , because Markdown supports inline HTML , if you use angle brackets as delimiters for HTML tags , Markdown will treat them as such .
But if you write :
4 < 5
Markdown will translate it to :
4 < 5
However , inside Markdown code spans and blocks , angle brackets and ampersands are always encoded automatically .
This makes it easy to use Markdown to write about HTML code .
( As opposed to raw HTML , which is a terrible format for writing about HTML syntax , because every single < and & in your example code needs to be escaped . )
Block Elements
Paragraphs and Line Breaks
A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text , separated by one or more blank lines .
( A blank line is any line that looks like a blank line — a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is considered blank . )
Normal paragraphs should not be indented with spaces or tabs .
The implication of the “ one or more consecutive lines of text ” rule is that Markdown supports “ hard - wrapped ” text paragraphs .
This differs significantly from most other text - to - HTML formatters ( including Movable Type ’s “ Convert Line Breaks ” option ) which translate every line break character in a paragraph into a < br /> tag .
When you do want to insert a < br /> break tag using Markdown , you end a line with two or more spaces , then type return .
Yes , this takes a tad more effort to create a < br /> , but a simplistic “ every line break is a < br /> ” rule would n’t work for Markdown .
Markdown ’s email - style blockquoting and multi- paragraph list items work best — and look better — when you format them with hard breaks .
Headers
Markdown supports two styles of headers , Setext and atx .
Setext - style headers are “ underlined ” using equal signs ( for first - level headers ) and dashes ( for second - level headers ) .
For example :
This is an H1 =============
This is an H2 -------------
Any number of underlining = ’s or - ’s will work .
Atx - style headers use 1 - 6 hash characters at the start of the line , corresponding to header levels 1 - 6 .
For example :
# This is an H1 ##
This is an H2 ######
This is an H6
Optionally , you may “ close ” atx - style headers .
This is purely cosmetic — you can use this if you think it looks better .
The closing hashes do n’t even need to match the number of hashes used to open the header .
( The number of opening hashes determines the header level . ) :
# This is an H1 # ##
This is an H2 ## ###
This is an H3 ######
Blockquotes
Markdown uses email - style > characters for blockquoting .
If you ’re familiar with quoting passages of text in an email message , then you know how to create a blockquote in Markdown .
It looks best if you hard wrap the text and put a > before every line :
> This is a blockquote with two paragraphs .
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , > consectetuer adipiscing elit .
Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus .
>
Vestibulum enim wisi , viverra nec , fringilla in , laoreet vitae , risus .
> >
Donec sit amet nisl .
Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit .
Suspendisse > id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing .
Markdown allows you to be lazy and only put the > before the first line of a hard - wrapped paragraph :
> This is a blockquote with two paragraphs .
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetuer adipiscing elit .
Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus .
Vestibulum enim wisi , viverra nec , fringilla in , laoreet vitae , risus . >
Donec sit amet nisl .
Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit .
Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing .
Blockquotes can be nested ( i.e. a blockquote - in - a - blockquote ) by adding additional levels of > :
> This is the first level of quoting .
> > >
This is nested blockquote .
> >
Back to the first level .
Blockquotes can contain other Markdown elements , including headers , lists , and code blocks :
> ##
This is a header .
> >
1 . This is the first list item . >
2 . This is the second list item . > >
Here 's some example code : > > return shell_exec ( " echo $ input | $ markdown_script " ) ;
Any decent text editor should make email - style quoting easy .
For example , with BBEdit , you can make a selection and choose Increase Quote Level from the Text menu .
Lists
Markdown supports ordered ( numbered ) and unordered ( bulleted ) lists .
Unordered lists use asterisks , pluses , and hyphens — interchangably — as list markers :
* Red * Green * Blue
is equivalent to :
+ Red + Green +
Blue
and :
- Red - Green - Blue
Ordered lists use numbers followed by periods :
1. Bird 2 . McHale 3 . Parish
It ’s important to note that the actual numbers you use to mark the list have no effect on the HTML output Markdown produces .
The HTML Markdown produces from the above list is :
< ol > < li>Bird </ li > < li>McHale</li > < li> Parish </li > </ol >
If you instead wrote the list in Markdown like this :
1. Bird 1 . McHale 1 . Parish
or even :
3. Bird 1 . McHale 8 . Parish
you ’d get the exact same HTML output .
The point is , if you want to , you can use ordinal numbers in your ordered Markdown lists , so that the numbers in your source match the numbers in your published HTML .
But if you want to be lazy , you do n’t have to .
If you do use lazy list numbering , however , you should still start the list with the number 1 .
At some point in the future , Markdown may support starting ordered lists at an arbitrary number .
List markers typically start at the left margin , but may be indented by up to three spaces .
List markers must be followed by one or more spaces or a tab .
To make lists look nice , you can wrap items with hanging indents :
* Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetuer adipiscing elit .
Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus .
Vestibulum enim wisi , viverra nec , fringilla in , laoreet vitae , risus .
* Donec sit amet nisl .
Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit .
Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing .
But if you want to be lazy , you do n’t have to :
* Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetuer adipiscing elit .
Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus .
Vestibulum enim wisi , viverra nec , fringilla in , laoreet vitae , risus .
* Donec sit amet nisl .
Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit .
Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing .
If list items are separated by blank lines , Markdown will wrap the items in < p > tags in the HTML output .
For example , this input :
* Bird * Magic
will turn into :
< ul > < li>Bird </ li > < li> Magic</li > </ul >
But this :
* Bird * Magic
will turn into :
< ul > < li>< p>Bird</p></li> < li><p>Magic</p></li> </ul >
List items may consist of multiple paragraphs .
Each subsequent paragraph in a list item must be indented by either 4 spaces or one tab :
1 . This is a list item with two paragraphs .
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetuer adipiscing elit .
Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus .
Vestibulum enim wisi , viverra nec , fringilla in , laoreet vitae , risus .
Donec sit amet nisl .
Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit .
2 . Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing .
It looks nice if you indent every line of the subsequent paragraphs , but here again , Markdown will allow you to be lazy :
* This is a list item with two paragraphs .
This is the second paragraph in the list item .
You 're only required to indent the first line .
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetuer adipiscing elit .
* Another item in the same list .
To put a blockquote within a list item , the blockquote ’s > delimiters need to be indented :
* A list item with a blockquote : >
This is a blockquote > inside a list item .
To put a code block within a list item , the code block needs to be indented twice — 8 spaces or two tabs :
* A list item with a code block : < code goes here >
It ’s worth noting that it ’s possible to trigger an ordered list by accident , by writing something like this :
1986 .
What a great season .
In other words , a number - period - space sequence at the beginning of a line .
To avoid this , you can backslash - escape the period :
1986 \ .
What a great season .
Code Blocks
Pre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about programming or markup source code .
Rather than forming normal paragraphs , the lines of a code block are interpreted literally .
Markdown wraps a code block in both < pre > and < code > tags .
To produce a code block in Markdown , simply indent every line of the block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab .
For example , given this input :
This is a normal paragraph :
This is a code block .
Markdown will generate :
< p> This is a normal paragraph : </ p> < pre >< code >
This is a code block .
</ code ></ pre>
One level of indentation — 4 spaces or 1 tab — is removed from each line of the code block .
For example , this :
Here is an example of AppleScript : tell application " Foo " beep end tell
will turn into :
< p> Here is an example of AppleScript : </ p> < pre >< code > tell application " Foo " beep end tell </ code ></ pre>
A code block continues until it reaches a line that is not indented ( or the end of the article ) .
Within a code block , ampersands ( & ) and angle brackets ( < and > ) are automatically converted into HTML entities .
This makes it very easy to include example HTML source code using Markdown — just paste it and indent it , and Markdown will handle the hassle of encoding the ampersands and angle brackets .
For example , this :
< div class = " footer " >
© 2004 Foo Corporation </div >
will turn into :
< pre >< code >< div class= " footer " > &copy ; 2004 Foo Corporation </div > </code ></ pre>
Regular Markdown syntax is not processed within code blocks .
E.g. , asterisks are just literal asterisks within a code block .
This means it ’s also easy to use Markdown to write about Markdown ’s own syntax .
Horizontal Rules
You can produce a horizontal rule tag ( < hr /> ) by placing three or more hyphens , asterisks , or underscores on a line by themselves .
If you wish , you may use spaces between the hyphens or asterisks .
Each of the following lines will produce a horizontal rule :
* * * *** ***** - - -
---------------------------------------
Span Elements
Links
Markdown supports two style of links : inline and reference .
In both styles , the link text is delimited by [ square brackets ] .
To create an inline link , use a set of regular parentheses immediately after the link text ’s closing square bracket .
Inside the parentheses , put the URL where you want the link to point , along with an optional title for the link , surrounded in quotes .
For example :
This is [ an example ] ( http://example.com/ " Title " ) inline link .
[ This link ] ( http://example.net/) has no title attribute .
Will produce :
< p> This is < a href = " http://example.com/ " title = " Title " > an example < / a> inline link .
</ p> < p >< a href = " http://example.net/ "
>
This link < /a> has no title attribute .
</ p>
If you ’re referring to a local resource on the same server , you can use relative paths :
See my [ About ] ( / about / ) page for details .
Reference - style links use a second set of square brackets , inside which you place a label of your choosing to identify the link :
This is [ an example ] [ id ] reference - style link .
You can optionally use a space to separate the sets of brackets :
This is [ an example ] [ id ] reference - style link .
Then , anywhere in the document , you define your link label like this , on a line by itself :
[ id ] : http://example.com/
" Optional Title Here "
That is :
Square brackets containing the link identifier ( optionally indented from the left margin using up to three spaces ) ;
followed by a colon ;
followed by one or more spaces ( or tabs ) ;
followed by the URL for the link ;
optionally followed by a title attribute for the link , enclosed in double or single quotes , or enclosed in parentheses .
The following three link definitions are equivalent :
[ foo ] : http://example.com/
" Optional Title Here " [ foo ] : http://example.com/
' Optional Title Here ' [ foo ] : http://example.com/
( Optional Title Here )
Note :
There is a known bug in Markdown.pl 1.0.1 which prevents single quotes from being used to delimit link titles .
The link URL may , optionally , be surrounded by angle brackets :
[ id ] : < http://example.com/>
" Optional Title Here "
You can put the title attribute on the next line and use extra spaces or tabs for padding , which tends to look better with longer URLs :
[ id ] : http://example.com/longish/path/to/resource/here
" Optional Title Here "
Link definitions are only used for creating links during Markdown processing , and are stripped from your document in the HTML output .
Link definition names may consist of letters , numbers , spaces , and punctuation — but they are not case sensitive .
E.g. these two links :
[ link text ] [ a ] [ link text ] [ A ]
are equivalent .
The implicit link name shortcut allows you to omit the name of the link , in which case the link text itself is used as the name .
Just use an empty set of square brackets — e.g. , to link the word “ Google ” to the google .com web site , you could simply write :
[ Google ] [ ]
And then define the link :
[ Google ] : http://google.com/
Because link names may contain spaces , this shortcut even works for multiple words in the link text :
Visit [ Daring Fireball ] [ ] for more information .
And then define the link :
[ Daring Fireball ] : http://daringfireball.net/
Link definitions can be placed anywhere in your Markdown document .
I tend to put them immediately after each paragraph in which they ’re used , but if you want , you can put them all at the end of your document , sort of like footnotes .
Here ’s an example of reference links in action :
I get 10 times more traffic from [ Google ] [ 1 ] than from [ Yahoo ] [ 2 ] or [ MSN ] [ 3 ] . [ 1 ] : http://google.com/
" Google " [ 2 ] : http://search.yahoo.com/
" Yahoo Search " [ 3 ] : http://search.msn.com/
" MSN Search "
Using the implicit link name shortcut , you could instead write :
I get 10 times more traffic from [ Google ] [ ] than from [ Yahoo ] [ ] or [ MSN ] [ ] . [ google ] : http://google.com/
" Google " [ yahoo ] : http://search.yahoo.com/
" Yahoo Search " [ msn ] : http://search.msn.com/
" MSN Search "
Both of the above examples will produce the following HTML output :
< p > I get 10 times more traffic from < a href = " http://google.com/ " title= " Google " > Google < /a> than from < a href = " http://search.yahoo.com/ " title= " Yahoo Search " > Yahoo < / a> or < a href = " http://search.msn.com/ " title= " MSN Search " >
MSN </a>.</ p>
For comparison , here is the same paragraph written using Markdown ’s inline link style :
I get 10 times more traffic from [ Google ] ( http://google.com/ " Google " ) than from [ Yahoo ] ( http://search.yahoo.com/
" Yahoo Search " ) or [ MSN ] ( http://search.msn.com/
" MSN Search " ) .
The point of reference - style links is not that they ’re easier to write .
The point is that with reference - style links , your document source is vastly more readable .
Compare the above examples : using reference - style links , the paragraph itself is only 81 characters long ; with inline - style links , it ’s 176 characters ; and as raw HTML , it ’s 234 characters .
In the raw HTML , there ’s more markup than there is text .
With Markdown ’s reference - style links , a source document much more closely resembles the final output , as rendered in a browser .
By allowing you to move the markup - related metadata out of the paragraph , you can add links without interrupting the narrative flow of your prose .
Emphasis
Markdown treats asterisks ( * ) and underscores ( _ ) as indicators of emphasis .
Text wrapped with one * or _ will be wrapped with an HTML < em > tag ; double * ’s or _ ’s will be wrapped with an HTML < strong > tag .
E.g. , this input :
* single asterisks * _single underscores_ ** double asterisks ** __double underscores__
will produce :
< em> single asterisks </em > < em>single underscores</em > < strong > double asterisks </strong > < strong > double underscores</strong >
You can use whichever style you prefer ; the lone restriction is that the same character must be used to open and close an emphasis span .
Emphasis can be used in the middle of a word :
un*frigging * believable
But if you surround an * or _ with spaces , it ’ll be treated as a literal asterisk or underscore .
To produce a literal asterisk or underscore at a position where it would otherwise be used as an emphasis delimiter , you can backslash escape it :
\ * this text is surrounded by literal asterisks \ *
Code
To indicate a span of code , wrap it with backtick quotes ( ` ) .
Unlike a pre-formatted code block , a code span indicates code within a normal paragraph .
For example :
Use the `printf ( ) ` function .
will produce :
< p>Use the < code > printf ( ) </ code > function .</ p>
To include a literal backtick character within a code span , you can use multiple backticks as the opening and closing delimiters :
`` There is a literal backtick ( ` ) here .
``
which will produce this :
< p>< code > There is a literal backtick ( ` ) here .</code ></p>
The backtick delimiters surrounding a code span may include spaces — one after the opening , one before the closing .
This allows you to place literal backtick characters at the beginning or end of a code span :
A single backtick in a code span : `` ` `` A backtick - delimited string in a code span : `` `foo` ``
will produce :
< p >A single backtick in a code span : < code>`</code ></p> < p > A backtick - delimited string in a code span : < code>`foo`</code ></ p>
With a code span , ampersands and angle brackets are encoded as HTML entities automatically , which makes it easy to include example HTML tags .
Markdown will turn this :
Please do n't use any ` < blink > ` tags .
into :
< p>Please do n't use any < code >< blink ></ code > tags .</ p>
You can write this :
` —` is the decimal - encoded equivalent of ` —` .
to produce :
< p>< code >&#8212 ;</code > is the decimal - encoded equivalent of < code > &mdash ;</ code >.</ p>
Images
Admittedly , it ’s fairly difficult to devise a “ natural ” syntax for placing images into a plain text document format .
Markdown uses an image syntax that is intended to resemble the syntax for links , allowing for two styles : inline and reference .
Inline image syntax looks like this :
![ Alt text ] ( / path/to/img.jpg ) ![ Alt text ] ( / path/to/img.jpg
" Optional title " )
That is :
An exclamation mark : ! ;
; followed by a set of square brackets , containing the alt attribute text for the image ;
attribute text for the image ; followed by a set of parentheses , containing the URL or path to the image , and an optional title attribute enclosed in double or single quotes .
Reference - style image syntax looks like this :
! [ Alt text ] [ id ]
Where “ id ” is the name of a defined image reference .
Image references are defined using syntax identical to link references :
[ id ] : url / to / image " Optional title attribute "
As of this writing , Markdown has no syntax for specifying the dimensions of an image ; if this is important to you , you can simply use regular HTML < img > tags .
Miscellaneous
Automatic Links
Markdown supports a shortcut style for creating “ automatic ” links for URLs and email addresses : simply surround the URL or email address with angle brackets .
What this means is that if you want to show the actual text of a URL or email address , and also have it be a clickable link , you can do this :
< http://example.com/>
Markdown will turn this into :
< a href = " http://example.com/ "
>http://example.com/</a>
Automatic links for email addresses work similarly , except that Markdown will also perform a bit of randomized decimal and hex entity - encoding to help obscure your address from address - harvesting spambots .
For example , Markdown will turn this :
into something like this :
< a href= " mailto: addre ss@example.co m">address@exa mple.com </a>
which will render in a browser as a clickable link to “ [ email protected ] ” .
( This sort of entity - encoding trick will indeed fool many , if not most , address - harvesting bots , but it definitely wo n’t fool all of them .
It ’s better than nothing , but an address published in this way will probably eventually start receiving spam . )
Backslash Escapes
Markdown allows you to use backslash escapes to generate literal characters which would otherwise have special meaning in Markdown ’s formatting syntax .
For example , if you wanted to surround a word with literal asterisks ( instead of an HTML < em > tag ) , you can use backslashes before the asterisks , like this :
\*literal asterisks \*
Markdown provides backslash escapes for the following characters :
TOKYO , Aug 9 ( Reuters ) - A strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.9 jolted central Japan on Sunday , halting some train services briefly but there were no immediate reports of damage .
The lengthy quake , felt across the capital just before 8 p.m. ( 1100 GMT ) , prompted railway services to halt some high - speed services briefly while tracks were checked , national broadcaster NHK said , but there were no immediate reports of damage .
The tremor was centred 340 km ( 210 miles ) deep under the sea south of Tokyo but , based on a Japanese scale of ground shaking from the Japan Meteorological Agency , it was unlikely there was much damage .
Earthquakes are common in Japan , one of the world 's most seismically active areas .
The country accounts for about 20 percent of the world 's earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater .
In October 2004 , an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 struck the Niigata region in northern Japan , killing 65 people and injuring more than 3,000 .
That was the deadliest quake since a magnitude 7.3 tremor hit the city of Kobe in 1995 , killing more than 6,400 .

Im Prinzip mag ich sie ja und habe sie immer wieder verteidigt – zuletzt selbst sogar , als sie nicht in der Lage waren , im Bundestag geschlossen gegen das Zensur - Gesetz zu stimmen .
Selbst mit der vollkommen zu Recht in der Blogosphäre zerrissenen unfassbaren Erklärung , warum man sich denn enthalten hat , bin ich nicht ins Gericht gegangen , vielleicht auch weil ich da schon nicht mehr weiter wusste .
Es ist keine Netzpolitik , die mich so wütend macht , sondern ein anderes Thema : Die “ Frauenpolitik ” der Grünen , die irgendwann in den 70 ern inhaltlich stehen geblieben ist .
Mich erreichte eben eine Mail der Grünen , die klar macht :
Auf mich legt man keinen Wert .
Das wusste ich schon früher , doch so deutlich war es halt bisher nie .
Vorab zu mir : Spart euch diese Mails , in denen mir die “ Lage der Frau ” in Deutschland erklärt wird .
Ich bin einer von diesen jungen Männern , die es sonst nur im Fernsehen gibt – ich versorge tagsüber meine ( übrigens zweite ) Tochter , während ich Abends und Nachts für mein Examen lerne .
Meine Lebensgefährtin gund Mutter beider Kinder arbeitet – Vollzeit .
Natürlich , denn mit meinem kleinen Nebenjob kann man keine Familie ernähren .
Das ist eine interessante Tradition : Schon mein Vater erzog mich , während seines Studiums , während meine Mutter Vollzeit arbeiten ging – und sich bis heute in einem von Männern dominierten Umfeld einen Posten erarbeitet hat , der selbst im Jahr 2009 noch etwas besonderes ist .
Dazu dann natürlich meine beiden Töchter , die ich sicherlich nicht so erziehe , dass ihre Zukunft von den 3 Ks bestimmt werden soll und für die ich mir eine selbstbewusste und selbstbestimmte Zukunft wünsche .
Also verzeiht mir , wenn ich diesem Bild der armen unterdrückten Frau in Deutschland herzlich wenig abgewinnen kann .
Mit meiner Lebensrealität hat es nichts zu tun – sehr wohl aber sehe ich , dass im Niedriglohnbereich sowie in sozialen Berufen Frauen ganz klar in der Mehrheit sind .
Deswegen setze ich mich ja u.a.
für eine Männerpolitik ein , die dafür sorgt , dass jungen Männern beigebracht wird , dass auch Jobs wie Kindergärtner oder Krankenpfleger “ echte Jobs ” sind und man nicht eher vor dem Fernseher auf der Couch versumpft , als mal den Staubsauger zu bewegen .
Vor diesem Hintergrund , aber auch vor dem Hintergrund meines ständigen Einsatzes für Demokratie und Gleichberechtigung , ist es vielleicht zu verstehen , dass mich eine Mail mit diesem Inhalt ( Auszug ) aufregt :
Bei den Europawahlen hat das Wahlverhalten der Wählerinnen das gute Ergebnis erst möglich gemacht .
In der Altergruppe der Frauen unter 30 wählten 7 Prozent mehr junge Frauen als junge Männer die Grünen und in der Altersgruppe unter 44 liegt der Unterschied immer noch bei 5 Prozent !
Das hat uns zu der Idee inspiriert bei den anstehenden Bundestagswahlen erstmalig eine frauenpolitische Aktionswoche des Landesverbandes auszurufen [ … ]
Bündnis 90 / die Grünen ist die einzige Partei mit 50/50 als Prinzip .
Wir haben tolle Frauen vor Ort und wir werden immer noch von viel mehr Frauen als Männern gewählt .
Das ist eine Frauenaktionswoche und einen Frauenaktionstag wert !
Mal übersetzen : Weil mehr Frauen als Männer die Grünen gewählt haben , sollen die jetzt noch stärker beworben werden – nicht die Männer stärker an die Wahlurnen gerufen werden .
Andernorts würde man sich vielleicht Gedanken machen , wie man die Wahlstimmen insgesamt anhebt und dabei den Rückstand der Männer ausgleicht – nicht bei den Grünen , da ist das ganze Grund , noch mehr Frauen aufzurufen .
Garniert wird das Ganze mit der Lüge von dem “ 50/50 ” - Prinzip : Wer das Frauenstatut der Grünen mal liest und versteht , der begreift , dass das mit 50 /50 nichts zu tun hat .
Vielmehr sind 100 % - Frauenanteile bei den Grünen ausdrücklich erlaubt , während Männer maximal 50 % belegen dürfen .
Dabei dürfen Männer keinen ersten Listenplatz belegen – eben weil sie Männre sind .
Mit meinem Verständnis des Art.3 GG hat das wenig zu tun .
Wer – so wie ich – eine Politik der geschlechterbezogenen Problemlösungen sucht , dem rollen sich hier die Zehennägel auf :
Wir haben zu wenig Männer in sozialen Berufen .
Die Krebsvorsorge für Männer ist in unserem Gesundheitssystem auf dem Stand von vor 50 Jahren , Änderungen nicht in Sicht .
Es mehren sich Studien zur Überforderung von Jungen in Schulen ; die Frage , warum Männer in Kriminalitätsstatistiken weit über 80 % der Täter stellen , ist ein gesellschaftliches Tabu - Thema und wird als selbstverständlich hingenommen .
Auf diese drängenden Probleme haben die Grünen nur eine Antwort : Frauen an die Wahlurnen , Männer vernachlässigen .
Diejenigen , die jetzt kreischen , sollten sich zusammenreißen : Ich bin eindeutig für Frauenpolitik .
Ich mahne nur an , dass wir heute so weit sind , zu erkennen , dass Gleichberechtigung nur durch eine daneben postierte und thematisch differenzierte Männerpolitik erreicht werden kann .
Kein Mann wird Krankenpfleger , weil die Grünen Männer diskriminieren .
Junge Männer müssen vielmehr lernen , sich selbst anders wahr zu nehmen – die überaltete Einstellung der Grünen ist insofern nicht nur kontraproduktiv , sie ist für unsere Gesellschaft gefährlich .
Natürlich : Die “ Frauenpolitik ” der CDU ist mir keine Zeile wert , die SPD ist eindeutig von Männern dominiert .
Wenn diese Parteien aber der Maßstab sein müssen , ist es mit den Grünen ohnehin ganz vorbei .
Für mich ist eines klar :
Als junger Mann bin ich bei den Grünen unerwünscht .
Meine Mitarbeit ist mit Blick auf das Frauenstatut vielleicht geduldet , aber ich muss es wohl als Privileg sehen , als Mann dort überhaupt gewählt zu werden , wobei mir – schön undemokratisch – bestimmte Dinge nur auf Grund meines Geschlechts verwehrt sind ( etwa der erste Listenplatz ) .
Daher mache ich hier eines deutlich : Meine Unterstützung der Grünen endet hier und jetzt .
Ich arbeite bei mir im Dorf mit einer Gruppe von Grünen zusammen , das wird auch weiter so bleiben ( meine Kritik wird hier übrigens geteilt ) – alles andere wird von mir kategorisch abgelehnt .
Und ich handle ja offensichtlich ganz im Sinne der Grünen , wenn ich jedenfalls meine männlichen Leser dazu aufrufe , bei den nächsten Landtags und Bundestagswahlen nicht die Grünen zu wählen .
Ralph Epperson
Historian , Author & Researcher
Ralph has been researching the CONSPIRATORIAL VIEW OF HISTORY ( the view that the major events of the past have been planned years in advance by a central conspiracy ) for 50 years .
He has written or produced four " best selling " books entitled THE UNSEEN HAND , THE NEW WORLD ORDER , MASONRY : CONSPIRACY AGAINST CHRISTIANITY , JESSE JAMES , UNITED STATES SENATOR , six booklets , and 15 DVDs .
He is a graduate of the University of Arizona , but freely admits that what he has learned since graduation has taught him that most of what he learned in college in History and Political Science simply is not true .
He proudly states that his research has proven to him that there has been an active conspiracy in the world planning major wars , depressions , and inflations years in advance .
Many of those who have read his material and viewed his DVDs state that they are the best in the market on this subject .
If you want to know how this conspiracy has operated in the world from one of the best researchers into the REALITY of this conspiracy , from one of the best teachers and writers , you will want to obtain some or all of his materials .
Ralph Epperson comes back on our show to share information about THE New World Order ’s desire - plan TO REDUCE THE WORLD POPULATIONS through a VIRUS and then a WORLDWIDE MANDATORY VACCINE .
This would fulfill the message engraved in the GEORGIA GUIDE STONES .
The problem is that Trump tells us his vaccine will be VOLUNTARY which so might be the reason that the Socialists in the gov't want to remove hgim so they can make the vaccine COMPULSORY .
I have PROVED that DARWIN ADMITTED THAT EVOLUTION WAS TOTALLY A FRAUD in his book .
That might catch someone 's attention !!
Ralph may also share some new information about Jack Ruby during the Kennedy Assassination .
The day is November 22 , 1963 .
The place is Dallas , Texas .
President John Kennedy has come to the city and will be appearing in a motorcade through the streets of the city .
He will be seated in an open air limousine , driven by a Secret Service agent .
A spectator named Abraham Zapruder goes to the park near where the President 's car will be driven , and records the entire scene in his motion picture camera .
YOU CAN NOW WATCH THE FILM THAT HE MADE AND SEE THE DRIVER OF THE LIMOUSINE SLOWLY BRING THE CAR TO ALMOST A HALT , TURN AROUND , AND FIRE AN AIR - FIRED PISTOL AT THE HEAD OF THE PRESIDENT !

wikipedia.org/A._Ralph_Epperson
It 's disturbing that one of the major difficulties in the struggle to shut down the ongoing national embarrassment at Guantanamo Bay stems from the unwillingness of any local jurisdiction to accept terrorists in their civilian prisons .
The fact that this misdiagnosed bout of populist anxiety might actually halt the termination of one of the least attractive chapters in recent U.S. history is as ludicrous as it is discouraging , particularly since any rational assessment reveals these fears are totally baseless .
America is perhaps the most experienced and successful jailer in the history of mankind - at recent count , we have roughly 2.3 million men and women under lock and key within our borders , more than one percent of our total adult population .
One wonders , given our long history of success in this field ( if success is defined as incarcerating horrifyingly large numbers of the body politic ) why at this critical juncture the populace suddenly has come to doubt our well - demonstrated record of excellence in this area ?
Buck up , America !
We may not be able to make cars , balance our debt or conclude wars , but we lock up citizens with the best of them !
Something hot leaps up in my chest at the suggestion that some foreign - born miscreant is to be considered more dangerous than an American thoroughbred .
It is understandable that a nation raised on Tom Clancy novels has an inaccurate understanding of the skills and resources of a terrorist operative , but there is no reason to think a transfer from Guantanamo Bay would represent any more substantial an escape risk than the average felon , and many reasons to think they would be less capable than a homegrown rapist , murder or drug dealer .
The detainees in question have no special spy skills - they are not masters of Judo , suave double agents , superhuman killers , proficient escape artists , nor any other of the villainous archetypes our fantasists create to bedevil and beguile their square - jawed protagonists .
Had these prisoners any extraordinary abilities upon their arrest by U.S. forces , one feels assured that spending a half - decade - plus beneath the tender ministrations of the Bush administration has likely not done wonders for their mental or physical capacities , anymore than it has for the moral standing of the nation .
For the sake of argument let 's say that a few of these foreign nationals , using their secret terrorists powers , manage to flee their incarceration - what horrifying calamities does one foresee from the escape of a former - Guantanamo detainee that are n't matched by the theoretical consequences of the escape of the aforementioned American - born sociopath ?
Do we expect them to set up a doomsday machine in the area using whatever materials are handily available ?
Again , one would expect an escaped terrorist to be less of a threat than an escaped criminal of another kind , given the limited facility with the language , incomplete knowledge of geography and lack of local support .
Or to put it more bluntly , a group of escaped Arabs in orange jump suits would stand out in Leavenworth , Kansas like , well , Arabs in Kansas .
Very few people , participating in an anonymous phone poll , are likely to tell someone at Gallup that they are thrilled at the notion of convicted terrorists living in their backyard , even if " backyard " is defined as the large super - maximum security prison in the outskirts of their state .
Equally few politicians , presented with these numbers by their staff , are likely to agree to said proposal in defiance of their constituents ' wishes .
But , like a great many unpopular things , this needs doing , and should some senator or governor be good enough to shoulder this burden , they could at least rest comfortable in the knowledge that after an initial wave of popular displeasure , the public 's memory in this matter would prove as brief as their judgment has proven poor .
As I see it , the price we pay for invading alien countries and abducting foreign nationals is that we have to find a place to put them .
Given that housing them extra-judicially in the curious geopolitical appendage of Guantanamo Bay seems finally to be proving objectionable to our legal and moral standards , another option must be found .
It 's time for some community to step up .
Speaking as an unelected representative , I nominate my home state of Maryland , and more particularly the Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center , a super - maximum security prison .
Citizens of the Old Line State , and in particular my fellow Baltimoreans , have fielded in the latter half of the 20th century an extraordinary crew of felons .
In exchange for whatever generous federal subsidy the Obama administration is willing to offer , we would be happy to lock up a few dozen terrorists and throw away the key - sort of The Wire vs. 24 .
If Khalid Sheikh Mohammed tunnels his way out and builds an atomic bomb out of hard - shell crabs , I suppose the Chesapeake area will pay for my foolhardy insistence on upholding the Constitution .
But in the interim we 'll take what small credit we deserve for maintaining national security in a fashion consistent with history and core principles .
“ The Federation for American Coal , Energy and Security ( FACES of Coal ) . ” the latest “ grassroots ” organization to join the public conversation on behalf of the coal industry , appears to be a project of the K - Street public relations firm , the Adfero Group , one of industry ’s most accommodating voices in Washington , D.C .
The FACES website , which includes no contact information , is registered to Adfero .
[ Update : since we posted this article , the website registration for facesofcoal.com has been updated overnight and Adfero ’s name has been wiped , however - thanks to research by one of our most loyal readers , Frank Bi , a cross-reference with Adfero ’s IP address still shows facesofcoal.com running on their server . ]
FACES describes itself as “ an alliance of people from all walks of life who are joining forces to educate lawmakers and the general public about the importance of coal and coal mining . ”
But Adfero ’s client list includes Koch Industries and the US Chamber of Commerce , two leaders in the fight to confuse , distort and deny the science of climate change - and especially to block government action that might affect their bottom line .
FACES ’ coming - out press release claimed the new group consists of , “ Some 70 different organizations and individuals representing a broad cross-section of people and communities throughout the Appalachian region are the coalition ’s first members .
Any individual , business or organization can join FACES of Coal . ”
But Adfero does n’t specialize in spontaneous public advocacy .
It specializes in crafting a “ custom - tailored message ” and then recruiting “ key contacts ” who can slam that message home .
Here , from Adfero ’s own website , is their own version :
“ At the end of the day , it ’s all about relationships .
From policymakers to homemakers , people respond best when the message is delivered by someone they know and trust .
“ That ’s where traditional grassroots outreach comes in .
Adfero is able to tap an impressive network of national , state and local contacts to deliver your custom - tailored message .
We ’ll identify and recruit local constituents , opinion leaders , community activists or political operatives to engage in activities designed to get attention and results .
We have access to key contacts on the ground who can conduct intercepts with elected officials at speeches , rallies , local town hall meetings and other events . ”
In addition to the recent manipulations on health care , there has been an unprecedented amount of astroturfing by the oil and coal lobby lately .
And there is no reason to believe this is anything but .
Certainly Adfero has n’t responded to our numerous inquiries with an alternative explanation .
Yet someone is paying for Adfero ’s “ grassroots ” services in the creation of the pro-coal FACES group .
Is it Koch Industries ?
The US Chamber of Commerce ?
Or is it someone not included in their list of clients ?
Once again , it ’s time Washington created a legal requirement for these groups to come clean on their funding .
The American people deserve to know who ’s really behind this campaign .
Phony Astroturf groups manipulate democracy in a way that is pointedly dishonest .
They work to convince legislators that “ people from all walks of life ” - also known as “ voters ” - are fired up about an issue , when in fact the voters in question are the kind of people Eugene McCarthy used to call “ provocateurs , ” taking money from industry to pretend to hold a particular opinion .
It ’s a practice that should stop - and , clearly , it wo n’t stop without being banged with a legislative hammer .
More than 25 million Americans have Swiss - cheese health insurance : it ’s full of holes .
Experts call them the “ under - insured . ”
They ’re families like the Martins of Durham , Maine .
Between them , Jim and Martha Martin work five part - time jobs .
Yet they still struggle every day with medical debts .
The burden warps nearly every aspect of their lives .
On a typical day Jim and Martha are up before dawn .
That ’s when they talk about necessary stuff .
“ We ’re both working so many jobs , about the only time we sit down together is at breakfast , ” Martha says .
Jim adds : “ There ’s not much time when I ’m not at work . ”
As hard as they both work to make their modest income – about $ 45,000 a year – the medical bills pile up .
Jim and Martha struggle all the time to figure out how to keep up .
Their daughters ’ bedrooms are right above the kitchen .
So sometimes , 19 - year - old Sara and Rebekah , 14 , ca n’t help overhearing some of these early - morning conversations .
“ You feel guilty , being their kid and kind of saying , ‘ Hey , I wish I could get money somewhere so I could help you out with that , ' ” Sara says .
“ You feel guilty . ”
Some Insurance Is n’t Enough
The Martins are basically healthy .
But not long ago , Sara had to go to the emergency room – twice – for a locked jaw .
She has health coverage through her college , but the insurer would n’t pay for the visits .
And last year Rebekah had to have a major operation .
The bare - bones insurance policy Martha had at the time , through a part - time job at a local mail - order retailer , did n’t pay for a lot of Rebekah ’s care .
Sitting in her home office , Martha Martin pulls out a fat folder marked Medical Bills .
“ We got a bill from the anesthesiologist , ” she says , riffling through the papers .
“ We got a bill from the hospital .
We got a bill from the surgeon .
We got a bill from the blood work people .
We got a bill for the ultrasound .
You get to a point where you just feel like you ’rejust a general feeling of overwhelmed - ness . ”
The Martins do n’t walk away from bills .
They ’ve set up payment plans with all the medical providers .
It adds up to $ 400 a month – a substantial chunk of their income .
When Martha feels overwhelmed , Jim calms her down .
For more than a decade , he ’s worked at a boatyard building sleek kayaks and canoes .
He makes $ 16 an hour .
But recently , the boatyard got new owners .
They ’ve cut his hours .
And the company does n’t provide health insurance for part - timers .
His insurance expired August 31 .
Jim Martin also works part - time at Walmart .
But he ’s not eligible for insurance there yet .
Being without health insurance does n’t bother him too much , he says .
To take his mind off problems he gets outside .
He ’s hiked most of New England ’s tallest peaks .
“ My grandfather dropped dead at the age of 58 , but he did n’t take care of himself , ” he says .
“ And I like to think I ’m doing things better , healthy - wise , than the generation before me .
And maybe that ’s my insurance , is to stay active . ”
But what if he had an accident ?
“ I do n’t know , ” he replies .
“ I do possess faith in God . ”
He does n’t think too far ahead , he says .
“ It ’s just day - to - day , week - to - week , month - to - month . ”
The ‘ Magic Mom Wand ’ Ca n’t Fix Everything
Around noon on one recent day , Martha Martin gets into her blue minivan .
She ’s on her way to one of her three part - time jobs – providing home help for elderly clients .
She ’s spent the morning at an appointment with her daughter Rebekah .
The 14 - year - old has been dealing with anxiety and depression .
Her mother ’s been worried about the cost of counseling .
But today there ’s good news :
A grant from the state of Maine provides free counseling for adolescents .
At the same time , Martin is upset by what the counselor had to say .
“ The counselor told me one of Rebekah ’s major reasons for depression is because she feels like every time she has a medical issue it generates a bill which she knows we can’t pay , ” Martha says .
“ I do n’t remember as a 14 - year - old even being aware that ’s there ’s bills that have to be paid . ”
Martha says she can keep her own problems in perspective , but it ’s harder when it comes to Rebekah .
“ You always want to wave your magic ‘ Mom wand , ’ and fairy dust comes out and it makes life , you know , easy for them , ” Martha says .
But she ca n’t dwell on that .
After helping an elderly client with shopping , she has to report for her job at the local supermarket .
She ’s the helpful lady behind the deli counter who always has time to offer a free slice of cheese or bologna to a little kids who are shopping with their moms .
Martha loves her customers .
But she ’s 52 , and after years in the food service business , these jobs are taking their toll .
She has carpal tunnel syndrome , but ca n’t afford to see a doctor about it .
“ My hands hurt , my feet hurt .
You know , I ’m getting older , ” she says .
“ I ’m finding that moving the slicers to clean under them and lifting the heavy things of meat [ is hard ] .
And you know , I took this [ job ] because it offered insurance . ”
Medical Costs Are Nearly Half Their Income
But the policy she has is very limited .
It covers only her , not her family .
And every time she needs care , she ’s left with more bills to pay .
After her supermarket shift , Martha goes back to her little house .
It ’s bright pink – the exact color , she says , of Mary Kay Cosmetic ’s Dusty Rose lipstick .
Martha Martin is a Mary Kay “ consultant ” or saleswoman .
That ’s another one of her part - time jobs .
She painted her house pink so her customers could find it more easily .
It sits at the end of a country lane .
Inside there ’s an impressive collection of antique furniture and carefully displayed blue - patterned china that her parents spent a lifetime collecting .
They died last year .
Martha has started selling some of these antiques to keep up with the bills .
“ You know , it is just stuff , ” she says .
“ It ’s emotional stuff , but it ’s just stuff and not as important as the people .
But , um , once it ’s gone , it ’s gone and I ca n’t get it back . ”
But Martha does n’t have much choice .
More medical bills are coming .
She needs to have a hysterectomy next month , and she says her insurance will pay only $ 1,000 of the hospital bill .
For the Martins , 2009 is starting to look a lot like 2008 .
Last year they paid $ 6,210 in health insurance premiums for themselves and daughter Sara , plus another $ 13,955 in uncovered hospital bills after Rebekah ’s surgery .
It added up to almost 45 percent of their total income of $ 44,815 .
“ Forty - five percent !
That ’s just crazy !
I do n’t pay that much in taxes , ” Martin exclaims .
“ So you know , I just think there should be a health insurance plan out there that everyone can sign up for . ”
She ’d be happy to pay the premiums , she says , if only she could get decent coverage .
ROCHESTER , Mich .
( AP )  Classes at a suburban Detroit university were canceled indefinitely on Thursday after professors went on strike , upset over being asked to freeze their salaries a year after the university ’s president received a $ 100,000 raise .
Oakland University , which has about 18,000 students , was to begin its fall semester on Thursday , but the teachers ’ union authorized a strike the night before .
The union , which represents 450 faculty members at the public four - year institution , said it decided to strike after the university proposed a three - year wage freeze along with cuts in health insurance benefits .
“ It was not something we wanted to do , because we are concerned about the welfare of our students , ” said Sharon Mills - Wisneski , an assistant nursing professor , while standing on the picket line at the entrance to the campus here .
“ But it was something that needed to be done . ”
La Chiesa cattolica , si sente dire di questi tempi , condanna il peccato ma non il peccatore , e dunque la bestemmia e non il bestemmiatore , l’assassinio e non l’assassino , il meretricio e non il semplice “ utilizzatore finale ” ; e così via .
Camillo Langone ( “ critico di professione e nell ’ animo , oltre che fervente cattolico ” che “ ogni domenica varca la soglia di una chiesa con il taccuino in mano alla ricerca della messa perfetta ” e che dal suo sito invita i navigatori a contattarlo “ per brevi elogi e inviti a manifestazioni che prevedono un gettone di presenza ” ) , preferisce forse invece attaccare con decisione le persone più che le loro idee , mostrandosi così un polemista della più aggressiva specie .
E ne fornisce un riprovevole esempio su “ Libero ” del 20 settembre 2009 , con un suo articolo contro Piero Angela , per l’occasione bocciato sul tavolo della storia assieme a Camillo Benso conte di Cavour .
Tralasciando quest ’ultimo , sul quale conviene si pronuncino gli storici , quale sarebbero le colpe del nostro amato Piero ?
Quella di essere anticattolico ( o meglio ateista , e forse addirittura ateo ) , darwinista , riduzionista , e soprattutto nepotista ed intoccabile ; ma anche di predicare , dal suo pulpito televisivo , cose interessanti quanto “ il manuale di istruzioni di una fotocopiatrice “ a folle adulanti di minorenni ballerini ed impasticcati ; ed infine di portare “ inconcepibili calzini bianchi ” .
Per colmare la misura , anche il figlio - nepote del presentatore viene crocifisso senza sconti .
In primo luogo perchè colpevole di parlare gesticolando eccessivamente : allargando troppo le braccia , o sollevando oltre misura le mani .
Neanche fosse Pio XII ( che invece , ‘ beato ’ lui , secondo i cattolici , quanto più si atteggiava divisticamente - in stile cinema muto- tanto più era ‘ ieratico ’ , magniloquente ed affascinante , anziché “ comico ” e “ ritardato ” come Alberto ) .
Attaccare Piero Angela non è però agevole , essendo da decenni uno dei migliori giornalisti televisivi italiani ; certamente uno dei più rigorosi nel coniugare correttezza dell ’ informazione e stile espositivo ; uno al quale non sfuggirebbe mai un plurale come “ i carceri ” ; uno che ha guadagnato il pubblico con lo stile impeccabile e la solidità dei contenuti , mai con l’arroganza ideologica ; uno che non rigira la frittata come i preti in carenza di argomenti .
Eppure ( udite , udite , quale accusa e colpa ! ) , la premiata e “ ben affiatata ” ditta - famiglia Angela sarebbe , secondo Langone , alla inutile ricerca del famoso “ anello mancante ” fra la scimmia e l’uomo ; o peggio fingerebbe artatamente , sapendo di non potere riuscire nell ’impresa , al solo scopo di confezionare “ millanta puntate ” dei suoi programmi .
Cosa che neanche il sacro Graal !
né le migliaia di sciocchi volumi sulle madonne apparizionarie globetrotter !
Ma , ben sappiamo , quando si vuole denigrare qualcuno la semplificazione è d’obbligo : basta isolare dal contesto un paio di frasi o di scritti ( come sosteneva Voltaire ) per capovolgere qualunque ritratto ed interpretazione .
Così la sequenza evolutiva che ha portato all ’uomo viene riassunta maliziosamente da Langone nell ’ accoppiamento di due “ ornitorinchi ” che generano Miss Italia : eventualità che al nostro sembrerà ovviamente ben più ridicola della sicura nascita di Adamo da una sputacchiera in argilla .
Ad un tratto Langone sembra cambiare tono ; confessa di avere un poco scherzato .
In realtà , la colpa maggiore di Angela sarebbe quella di essere un “ integralista del metodo scientifico ” incapace di accorgersi che partendo da queste basi ideologiche “ si impicca con la sua stessa corda ” , giacchè “ se un fenomeno per essere credibile deve poter essere riprodotto in laboratorio , l’evoluzione della specie è plausibile come l’esistenza degli unicorni ” .
Con buona pace della comunità scientifica mondiale ( e non di pochi revisionisti ) questa logica denigratoria è fin troppo semplice : chiedere sempre a chi usa il metodo scientifico l’inconfutabile prova delle prove , mentre a chi crede in astrusità di fede basterebbe citare un qualunque passo della Bibbia ( per quanto contraddetto da altri , o razionalmente contraddicibile ) .
Citato Angela , stranamente , non viene invece citata la creatura forse più amata da Angela , ovvero il CICAP .
Omissione , a mio avviso , non certo inspiegabile .
Qui infatti Langone dimostra di avere ben appreso da Superquark che i felini , con strategia predatoria vincente , non attaccano mai il branco , concentrandosi invece sull ’ individuo isolato .
Attaccare per intero il CICAP non gioverebbe , perché è molto più variegato nelle persone ; o forse perché lì , almeno a prima vista , non si intravedono nepoti né riprovevoli calzini bianchi ; o forse , e più probabilmente , perché al CICAP non si tocca l’argomento fede , e dunque non appare avversario pericoloso quanto i gruppi atei o anticlericali .
A riprova di questo , viene invece tirata in ballo l’UAAR , quella che “ riempie di scritte gli ateobus ” .
Il povero Langone è ovviamente male informato ( forse sta troppo in chiesa , e non ha tempo per guardarsi intorno ! ) , perché , come tutti ( tranne qualche clericale ) ben sanno , in Italia non è mai circolato nessun Ateobus , e ciò per colpa grave di varie appendici secolari della moderna Inquisizione di Santa Romana Chiesa , agenti in nome e per conto della ‘ libertà di espressionei riservata all ’unica ‘ verità ’ riconosciuta dal papa .
E paradossalmente ne fa le spese il povero Danilo Mainardi ( “ fissato con l ’idea che l’uomo è uno scimpanzé leggemente meno appassionato di banane ” ) che viene strettamente associato all ’UAAR , nel cui ambito si è espresso solo sporadicamente , piuttosto che a Quark e Superquark dove invece è immancabilmente presente .
Evidentemente si tratta di una accurata scelta strategica ; dalla quale si intuisce che , ancora una volta , il vero bersaglio di tutte queste accuse sono i non credenti in genere , più che la persona di Angela ( “ vecchio positivista alle soglie della pensione ” ) , che mai , almeno a mia memoria , ha professato una sua fede o una sua non fede in una qualche trasmissione televisiva .
La ciliegina finale è il procurato allarme di ritrovarsi un giorno ad abitare in Via o Piazza Piero Angela .
Figurarsi !
Come potrebbe succedere in un paese nel quale non si riesce neppure ad avere una via Darwin , e si è financo proposto di cambiare l’intitolazione all ’unico istituto superiore ( di Rivoli ) che porta questo nome !
Per chi non lo sapesse , questo Longone è autore di una sorta di guida Michelin delle messe , nella quale , presumo , si valuta quale farina sia più consona alla transustanziazione , e quale vino renda più gradevole l’ostia ; se in chiesa sia installato il climatizzatore , e se l’accompagnamento musicale sia politicamente corretto ; se la predica rispecchi l’etichetta , e se gli abiti dei celebranti siano griffati ; e via dicendo .
Questo si che è fondamentale e serio !
Ma finiamola qui ; giacchè di questi tempi chi non è allineato alle maggioranze parlamentari rischia risarcimenti milionari se divaga sul personale !
Preoccupiamoci piuttosto di riflettere su quanto di veramente importante traspare da questo ignobile scritto contro Angela e contro l’UAAR , ovvero analizzando le intenzioni più che le parole ( le sciocchezze infatti si commentano da sé ) e teniamo ben presente quanto l’emergente integralismo cattolico si associ ad un fascismo risorgente : ebbene , pagine come questa , nel clima politico di questi giorni , connotano uno squadrismo anti-laici ed anti-scienza , che ambisce ad esserne il braccio combattente .

Your very first look at Roman Polanski's next film , The Ghost , is here .
From Summit Entertainment comes a story that centers on a ghostwriter who is hired to complete the memoirs of a former British prime minister .
He uncovers secrets that put his own life in jeopardy .
Most of the story takes place in an oceanfront house during the middle of winter .
The film is set for theaters in 2010 and stars Ewan McGregor , Kim Cattrall , Olivia Williams , Jim Belushi , Robert Pugh , Tom Wilkinson and Pierce Brosnan .
WASHINGTON --
Phone and cable companies expressed concern about proposed rules that would prohibit Internet service providers from slowing competitors '
Web traffic or impeding access to legal Web content .
Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski , in a speech Monday , proposed putting teeth into current guidelines on so - called net neutrality by making them full - fledged rules , and extending them to wireless carriers .
" The bar needs to be set very high when it comes to additional government intervention , " said USTelecom , the phone industry 's lobbying group .
Cable giant Comcast Corp. said it will " be incredibly important for the agency to review the data to determine whether there are actual and substantial problems that may require rules . "
Large phone and video providers , including Comcast , Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. , have argued the government should n't tell them how to manage their Internet networks .
Wireless providers are worried that a surge in bandwidth - consuming applications such as video downloads could hobble their networks unless they are allowed to control the flow .
For consumers , the proposed FCC action would mean that any Internet provider -- whether wireless , cable or DSL -- would be prohibited from blocking or slowing access to video or phone services .
For example , Comcast or AT&T could n't feed video to a subscriber from one of their online video services faster than they allow feeds from a rival service , such as Netflix Inc .
It was almost a year ago that a Times Square tourist happened to videotape a police officer 's seemingly unprovoked assault on a cyclist during a Critical Mass group bike ride .
The video , which depicts rookie cop Patrick Pogan slamming 30 - year - old cyclist Christopher Long off his bike , sparked widespread outrage and ended up costing Pogan his job ( getting caught filing a false police report did n't help his case , either ) .
Long is now living in rural Wisconsin and working on a farm , but according to his lawyer , " There is psychological trauma , which explains why he is not living in New York City right now .
It is a terrible experience for him to go through . "
So naturally he 's suing the city , for $ 1.5 million , to help ease the pain .
For a long time I did not have health care .
I was fresh out of college and was relatively healthy .
For me , there was no real need for health insurance .
But , a year and a half or so ago I decided that it was in my best interest to sign up for a health care plan .
I spent about two weeks using sites like ehealthinsurance .com comparing literally hundreds of plans with all kinds of different features until I found the one that suited me best .
I selected an HSA from Kaiser Permanente .
An HSA ( Health Savings Account ) is similar to an IRA , but for health care savings rather than for retirement .
A person enrolled in a HSA is allowed to contribute up to $ 3000 tax free each year to their account .
Under Federal law , these HSA ’s must be paired with a HDHP ( High Deductible Health Plan ) .
For example , my plan has a $ 1200 deductible , but everything after that is covered 100 % by Kaiser .
I love my plan .
The point of having the high deductible plan is to encourage patients to keep their health care costs down .
If a customer knows that they have to spend the first $ 1200 of their health care expenses out of pocket , they are more likely to avoid unnecessary health care expenses .
Conversely , a health emergency is extremely unlikely to lead to major financial distress , as the maximum out of pocket expenditures are only $ 1200 .
I mentioned above that an HSA is similar to an IRA and that I am legally allowed to contribute $ 3000 tax free to my account each year .
This allows individuals to save money for their future health care expenses .
For example , if I deposit the maximum of $ 3000 , but only spend $ 1500 , including all medical bills and over the counter and prescription drugs , I am left with a surplus of $ 1500 in my account .
This money can be kept in an interest bearing savings account , invested in a money market , or invested in the stock market .
This type of plan obviously doesnt suit everyone , but it is a great plan for people like me : young , relatively healthy people with minimal health care costs .
Because I enrolled in this plan while young and healthy , I can use the unspent funds remaining in my account to save for when I am a sick old man with high health care costs .
In fact , while insurance premiums were expected to rise around 8 % this year , my premium actually dropped by 3.6 % !
It dropped because I kept costs for both me and my insurance company under control .
As I said above , I am an informed consumer who spent quite a long time comparing plans until I found the plan that I felt was best for me .
This plan has some great features , encourages saving and allows me to contribute money on a pre-tax basis .
It has also resulted in my premiums actually going down in a time when most people are seeing rather large increases .
My plan is great as it is , but if the government wanted to make health care more affordable , they would remove contribution limits on HSA ’s , allowing consumers to place much more money in these plans .
They could also allow users of any health plan to enroll in an HSA , rather than limiting HSA ’s only to those with high deductible plans .
Making these reforms would lead to lower costs for many Americans , and would create an incentive for the young and healthy to save money for the future when they face declining health .
Sadly , the Democrats ’ health care plans will outlaw my health insurance plan .
I dont even understand why anyone would want to outlaw this plan–it really is great– but there seems to be a lot of things that I dont understand these days .
Are these Congressmen so conceited that they actually believe that they are capable of making a better decision about my own life than am I ?
None of these people have ever met me .
None of them can possibly understand my health care needs better than I do .
Americanly Yours ,

Husband of Wrong - Way Driver Says She Didn't Drink Lawyer indicates the family is considering exhuming body for second autopsy .
Aug. 6 , 2009  --
The husband of the woman who police say killed eight people by driving drunk and stoned the wrong way on a New York highway insisted today the toxicology reports cannot be correct .
" My heart is at rest every night I go to bed .
She did not drink , " Daniel Schuler told a news conference 11 days after the horrific crash on the Taconic State Parkway .
Schuler 's wife , Diane , is blamed for the July 26 head - on collision that killed her daughter and three of her nieces when she plowed into an SUV .
Three men in the SUV also died .
The only person to survive was Schuler 's 5 - year - old son .
A police toxicology report released this week concluded that Schuler had the equivalent of 10 drinks still in her stomach and had consumed a high amount of marijuana .
" No way , it ca n't be true , " said Diane Schuler 's sister - in - law Joy Schuler at the news conference .
" There is no way she would ever jeopardize the children . "
Schuler 's husband said he never once saw his 36 - year - old wife drunk since he met her .
" She did not drink .
She was not an alcoholic , " he insisted .
" Something medically had to have happened . "
" She was the perfect wife , an outstanding mother , hard worker , reliable person , trustworthy .
I 'd marry her again tomorrow , " Daniel Schuler said while trying to hold back tears .
Dominic Barbara , a lawyer for the Schuler family , said Diane Schuler was diabetic and suggested that may have contributed to her disoriented condition that morning .
He also suggested that Schuler may have suffered a stroke .
Barbara said the family had not yet decided whether to exhume the body for a second autopsy .
Barbara asked anyone with information about Schuler or the events leading to the crash to contact his investigators at the CMP Group in New York .
The families of the three men who died in the SUV have indicated they might sue whoever allowed Schuler to drive drunk .
" Any person who was aware that she was drinking is an accomplice , " said Irving Anolik , a lawyer for the families of Guy Bastardi , 49 , Michael Bastardi , 81 , and Daniel Longo , 74 , who died in the crash .
" She did n't just wake up one morning with a drug problem and capable of drinking that much alcohol . "
Anolik made his warning Wednesday .
Schuler had a blood alcohol content of .19 , more than double the legal limit , and was also " impaired by marijuana , " according to a statement released by state attorney Janet Difiore citing a toxicology report by the Westchester County medical examiner .
Wrong Way Crash Is Ruled a Homicide
Investigators could not determine if Schuler had been drinking while she was driving , but alcohol was in her stomach at the time of the autopsy and a broken bottle of vodka was found at the crash scene , New York State Police Major William Carey said at a press conference earlier this week .
It was not clear exactly how much or when Schuler smoked marijuana ; the toxicology reported " high " levels of THC , the active ingredient in pot , Westchester director of toxicology Betsy Spratt said .
But " there were approximately 10 drinks still in her , " Spratt said , that had yet to be metabolized .
The combination of alcohol and marijuana " intensified " the effects of each , Spratt said .
" With that level of alcohol we talk in ranges .
She would 've had difficulty with perception , judgment and memory .
Around that level you get tunnel vision , " Spratt said .
Carey said , " There 's no indication there will be any criminal charges forthcoming . "
Police initially said they had no indication Schuler was impaired while driving , Carey said .
" We did not have people that morning describe Diane Schuler as anything other than to say she was fine , " Carey said .
The crash was ruled a homicide last week before the toxicology report was completed , Westchester medical examiner Dr. Millard Hyland told ABCNews.com .
" It was ruled a homicide in terms of people being killed because she was driving in the wrong direction , " Hyland said , and did not take toxicology into account .
The co-owner of the upstate N.Y. campground said she knew Diane Schuler well and saw her off on the day of the accident .
" If she had alcohol on her breath , I sure did n't smell it , " said Scott .
" The last thing I said to her was ' have a safe trip home ' and she said , ' We will ' and that was the end of it .
Schuler was driving home from a New York campground on the Taconic State Parkway , a route she knew well , when she somehow ended up driving the wrong way in the fast lane into oncoming traffic .
During the drive , Schuler called her brother to tell him she was n't feeling well .
He asked her to pull over immediately .
Schuler did not pull over , but her brother was worried enough to call the police .
Two hours after the call to her brother , police believe Schuler turned onto the parkway , heading down an exit ramp with signs clearly stating that she was heading the wrong way .
She drove in the fast lane , straight into traffic .
Oncoming cars swerved to miss her .
Surviving Driver : She Was ' In Control '
One of the drivers in her path , Richard Rowe , managed to avoid a crash with Schuler who he said seemed " in total control . "
" I do n't understand .
She was in total control of the car , " Rowe said .
" Maybe initially she was confused , but she had lots of time to correct her mistake .
If we had been 30 seconds later , we would have been hit by her . "

With hours remaining before the new , Post - 9/11 GI Bill takes effect , officials from California and from the Department of Veterans Affairs are working to fix a technical glitch that threatens to prevent thousands of California veterans from receiving money for tuition .
Officials were unable to say for certain Friday whether the problem will be fixed in time to help veterans in the current academic year .
The new GI Bill takes effect today , with President Obama attending a kickoff event with Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki on Monday , when tuition checks will begin being sent to colleges across the nation .
" The Obama administration and Secretary Shinseki are actively working with officials to find a viable solution that will provide veterans with the maximum financial support to attend the school of their choice , " said VA spokeswoman Katie Roberts .
Qualified veterans attending undergraduate public colleges and universities in California will be able to enjoy the new benefit .
But a California quirk had thrown into question whether or not veterans attending private and graduate institutions would be able to receive the same benefits as veterans in other states .
The problem stems from California 's history of labeling the money students pay to attend state universities " fees " instead of " tuition . "
The new GI Bill reimburses qualified veterans for their full undergraduate tuition at public colleges and pays an amount equivalent to that tuition to veterans who choose to attend private schools or graduate programs .
Because the University of California charged no " tuition " - instead charging " fees " - the VA had ruled that veterans attending private schools or graduate programs in California could receive no tuition reimbursement , even though most of the cost of those programs is called tuition .
Such students could be reimbursed fees - along with other new GI Bill benefits such as a housing allowance and book budget - but many veterans seeking to attend private or graduate institutions came up thousands of dollars short for tuition .
In July , UC officials stopped calling the money students paid a fee and started calling it tuition to avoid harming veterans , said Nancy Coolidge , the UC system 's coordinator of student financial support .
The new fee structure and terminology was sent to the VA in early July , she said .
In May , Rep. Mike Thompson , D - St. Helena , and Rep. Howard " Buck " McKeon , R - Santa Clarita ( Los Angeles County ) introduced legislation that would have effectively erased the distinction between fees and tuition in the new GI Bill .
The bill gained 48 co-sponsors from across California .
Both of California 's senators asked the VA to revise the regulation , while Secretary of Education Arne Duncan told McKeon in a May hearing that fixing the problem was a " no- brainer . "
Some veterans are holding out hope that a solution will be found , but others say they do not expect a solution for this academic year .
Santa Clara 's Melanie Walker , 39 , a 1st lieutenant in the Army Reserve who served two combat tours in Baghdad , will study at the University of Southern California 's military social work program and hopes to get support from the GI Bill .
Failing that , she has federal and private student loans and a backup plan : returning to active - duty and committing to the time required for the Army 's student loan forgiveness program .
" I would just go active and be a military social worker for the Army .
But I do n't think it 's going to come to that ... the GI Bill problem will sort itself out , " she said .
" We 're all kind of still waiting and holding our breath to see what happens . "
There are many myths and strange notions aboutdiabetes and the most common of them is that diabetes cannot be reversed .
This is just never possible as with changes in lifestyle and even with just holistic help diabetes gets reversed by many .
Today diabetes is just one of the greatest diseases to come to affect thousands of Americans .
Thanks to the huge effect of junk food and refined sugar that diabetes has been coming to the stage that it is here now .
Doctors tell you repeatedly that giving up refined sugar and flour , even if you do n’t have diabetes is a powerfully healthy habit that will keep you healthy in many ways .
One can really escape a lot many diseases , including diabetes .
Not only do you lose weight but you have less of the processed sugar and feel better in health in many ways .
Beware of processed sugar in different hidden resources .
These could be in anything from your cream latte coffee to your daily bread .
To give up more of processed food one has to have whole foods like whole grains , fruits , vegetables and lean protein .
These whole foods really help you feel and look great and as well as give you much lesser chances of diseases like diabetes .
Some of the myths that follow this whole sugar and processed flour story is that you do n’t need to worry about it unless you get a disease like heart attack or diabetes .
Unfortunately most of our kids grown on processed sugar included in almost all of their food from ice cream to soda pop to candies and pastries .
There is hardly a thing that is without processed sugar and all of us in our childhood , has been overloaded and drugged processed sugar and flour , in such a way that it ultimately numbs our senses in every way possible and takes slow creeping toll of our health .
Stopping this cycle of getting out of it is really as important whether or not we are diabetic .
Yes that this means a severe cutting up off our “ feast ” food or our treats .
But we can always get a sugar free or non sugar alternative .
Aspartame and xylitol , unfortunately have a lot of problems coming with them to give us problems as well .
One of the best ways to sweeten our dishes is through natural plant extract stevia or raw honey .
Date syrup by blending dates in our blender with some water or just fresh fruit juices can also be used to sweeten some of our desserts and dishes .
You will be amazed how you do not miss sugar at all !
For many people diabetes may be inherited in the family but it does not have to be so if you make some key lifestyle changes .
Researchers at the Sahlgrenska Academy , Gothenburg , have discovered a new brain mechanism involved in alcohol addiction involving the stomach hormone ghrelin .
When ghrelin ’s actions in the brain are blocked , alcohol ’s effects on the reward system are reduced .
It is an important discovery that could lead to new therapies for addictions such as alcohol dependence .
Ghrelin is a hormone produced by the stomach and , by signalling in the brain , increases hunger .
The new finding , that it is also involved in alcohol addiction , highlights the reward system of the brain as a key target for ghrelin ’s effects .
" Ghrelin ’s actions in the brain may be of importance for all kinds of addictions , including chemical drugs such as alcohol and even food " says Suzanne Dickson , Professor of Physiology , a leading expert in appetite regulation .
The work emerged from a unique collaboration between the research groups of Prof Suzanne Dickson and Prof Emeritus Jörgen Engel , including researchers Dr Elisabet Jerlhag and Dr Emil Egecioglu .
They show that mice treated with ghrelin increase their alcohol consumption .
When ghrelin ’s actions are blocked , for example , by administering ghrelin receptor antagonists , mice no longer show preference for an alcohol - associated environment - in other words , alcohol is no longer able to produce its addictive effects , that include reward searching behaviour ( akin to craving in alcoholic patients ) .
" If we can develop drugs that block the receptors for ghrelin , we could have a new effective treatment for alcohol dependence .
It may however take several years until such a pharmacological treatment will reach the patient " , says Professor Emeritus Jörgen Engel , an authority on research on alcohol dependency at the Sahlgrenska Academy .
The group has submitted a patent application for this invention .
Alcohol dependence
It is estimated that five percent of the adult Swedish population are alcohol dependent .
Alcohol dependence is a complex and chronic disease which leads to adverse consequences affecting not only the patient but also their immediate family and has a profound economic burden on society ( estimated to be around 60 - 100 billion kronor per year ) .
Each year about 8,000 Swedes die of alcohol - related diseases .
The price of ivory has shot up and can fetch more than $ 1,000 per kg
Kenyan authorities have seized almost 700 kg of ivory worth millions of dollars in a night - time raid at the country 's main airport .
The Kenya Wildlife Service says a similar amount was intercepted in the Ethiopian capital , Addis Ababa .
Both consignments - with a potential value of more than $ 1.5 m ( £ 938,000 ) - were reportedly headed for Thailand .
The BBC's Will Ross in Nairobi says poaching is on the increase mostly owing to high demand for ivory in Asia .
Our reporter says it is not yet clear whether the ivory , recovered at Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta Airport , had been trafficked from other parts of the continent or was from East Africa .
Twenty years ago the world 's elephant population was plummeting and the trade in ivory was banned .
But over the past decade the ban has been periodically relaxed and occasional supervised ivory auctions have been allowed .
Chinese influence
Officials say the sales have fuelled demand for ivory in Asian countries , especially China , contributing to a sharp increase in elephant poaching .
So far this year poachers in Kenya have killed 128 elephants for their ivory ; last year 98 were killed .
In July , Kenyan authorities intercepted 16 elephant tusks and two rhinoceros horns being illegally exported to Laos from Mozambique .
Some wildlife experts have attributed the increase in elephant poaching to the presence of Chinese workers in Africa .
With demand for ivory products increasing back home , some Chinese workers on low salaries in Kenya are reported to have become middlemen in the ivory trade .
And because of the high demand for ivory across Asia , the price of ivory has shot up and can fetch more than $ 1,000 a kilo .
2009 November Nine Sponsorships Settled
With the final table of the 2009 Main Event of the World Series of Poker just over two months away , one of the biggest questions regarding this year ’s November Nine seems to have now been answered .
With the signing of Joe Cada , the sponsorships for all of the players at the final table are ( apparently ) settled .
2009 is a unique year for WSOP sponsorships , thanks to a new rule from Harrah ’s that limits the amount of players one company can sponsor .
Specifically , we ’re referring to Rule 43 - B- i : “ No more than three ( 3 ) players at the Final Table — and all other tables featured for television coverage — will be allowed to wear apparel with logos , patches or promotional language from the same entity . ”
The new rule forced the big rooms to modify their sponsorship approach , especially with chipleader Darvin Moon taking the path less traveled and essentially ruling out accepting sponsorship cash from an online poker room ( more on that below ) .
Anyhow , now that the wheeling and dealing is done with , here ’s where the final table stands :
PokerStars Gets …
Joe Cada , Eric Buchman and Kevin Schaffel .
That trifecta hands PokerStars three of the top six chip stacks in play , with Buchman topping the list at 34,800,000 in chips .
Many observers believe that Buchman – a tournament circuit regular with over a million in lifetime cashes – has the best chance to win the tournament , especially if Ivey fails to surge early .
Cada fits with the ‘ youth movement ’ model of PokerStars sponsorship , giving the room the chance to break the record for youngest Main Event winner again , while Schaffel is more in line with the Moneymaker / Raymer ‘ everyman ’ spokesperson model .
Full Tilt Poker gets …
FTP looked to have a serious coup on their hands when Phil Ivey made the final table , but most observers feel like Ivey ’s lack of presence in the mainstream media since the final table was determined has undermined a bit of the value FTP was expecting .
That could easily be reversed with a push closer to the Main Event final table , but his absence as ESPN is ratcheting up WSOP coverage seems a little odd .
FTP has reasonable backups with Steven Begleiter and James Akenhead .
Begleiter is a nice feel - good story cut from the Dennis Phillips cloth who will likely get a lot of narrative air time , and Akenhead who , while short stacked , is likely to be a big personality at the table and more than capable of running up his meager stack into a competitive one given his extensive online experience .
FTP also gets the benefit of Akenhsure , ead ’s European marketability , as he hails from the UK .
Everest Poker gets …
Antoine Saout , who qualified for the WSOP on Everest .
Saout is one of two non-Americans at the table , hailing from France , and Everest probably figured the Euro - angle plus the relatively cheap price and coherent story made for a nice deal to reinforce the exposure they ’ll already be getting as the title sponsor of the WSOP .
As a short stack with limited experience , he might not be around for long , but probably long enough for Chad to mention where he qualified a few times alongside some awkward jokes about Chad ’s ex-wives .
SpadeClub gets …
Spade what ?
Spade club is the online poker arm of CardPlayer magazine , and one assumes that ’s the banner Jeff Shulman will be flying at the final table given his day job as the editor of CardPlayer magazine .
Shulman ’s been the most vocal of the November Nine since the final table was set , but not in the most positive of ways – he seems intent on using his position as a platform to rabble - rouse for change at the WSOP , and his tactics ( including his early claim that he ’d throw the bracelet in the trash if he won ) have cost him some respect in the poker community .
No one gets …
Chip leader Darvin Moon , who has almost double the stack of second place .
Darvin has told various sources that he ’s never played a hand of online poker and is n’t interested in being sponsored by a room .
That , of course , does n’t rule out sponsorship from some non-poker entity , but Moon has said that “ he does n’t want to be tied up to anything ” , and it ’s hard to imagine a Home Depot ponying up more than PokerStars , so you ’re likely to see Moon repping the New Orleans Saints pro bono this November .

More so than ever , thanks to nearly constant increases in technology and bandwidth and decreases in the size of the devices that deliver information , we 're able to stay jacked in to whatever is important to us : social networks , work email , stock prices , and more at all times .
We 've talked about the importance of putting off email and other distractions in the morning to get things done , but according to the New York Times that is n't how many people start their day :
This is morning in America in the Internet age .
After six to eight hours of network deprivation - also known as sleep - people are increasingly waking up and lunging for cellphones and laptops , sometimes even before swinging their legs to the floor and tending to more biologically urgent activities .
" It used to be you woke up , went to the bathroom , maybe brushed your teeth and picked up the newspaper , " said Naomi S. Baron , a professor of linguistics at American University , who has written about technology 's push into everyday life .
" But what we do first now has changed dramatically .
I 'll be the first to admit : the first thing I do is check my e-mail . "

For Families Today , Technology is Morning 's First Priority [ The New York Times ]
It 's rare for a month to go by without some aspect of DNA sequencing making the headlines .
Species after species has seen its genome completed , and the human genome , whether it's from healthy individuals or cancer cells , has received special attention .
A dozen or more companies are attempting to bring new sequencing technology to market that could eventually drop the cost of sequencing down to the neighborhood of a new laptop .
Arguably , it 's one of the hottest high - tech fields on the planet .
But , although these methods can differ , sometimes radically , in how they obtain the sequence of DNA , they 're all fundamentally constrained by the chemistry of DNA itself , which is remarkably simple : a long chain of alternating sugars and phosphates , with each sugar linked to one of four bases .
Because the chemistry of DNA is so simple , the process of sequencing it is straightforward enough that anyone with a basic understanding of biology can probably understand the fundamentals .
The new sequencing hardware may be very complex , but all the complexity is generally there to just sequence lots of molecules in parallel ; the actual process remains pretty simple .
In a series of articles , we 'll start with the very basics of DNA sequencing , and build our way up to the techniques that were used to complete the human genome .
From there , we 'll spend time on the current crop of " next - generation " sequencing hardware , before going on to examine some of the more exotic things that may be coming down the pipeline within the next few years .
The basics of copying DNA
A short stretch of DNA
Anyone who 's made it through biology knows a bit about the structure of the double helix .
Half of one is shown above , to illustrate its three components : its backbone is made up of alternating sugars ( blue ) and phosphates ( red ) , and each sugar is linked to one of four bases ( green ) .
In this case , all of the bases shown are adenine ( A ) , although they could be potentially be guanine ( G ) , cytosine ( C ) , or thymine ( T ) .
In the double helix , the bases undergo base pairing to partners on the opposite strand : A with T , C with G .
When a cell divides and DNA needs to be replicated , the double helix is split , and enzymes called polymerases use each of the two halves as a template for an new opposing strand ; the base pairing rules ensure that the copying is exact , except for rare errors .
Historically , DNA sequencing has relied on the exact same process of copying DNA — in fact , the enzymes that make copies of DNA within a cell are so efficient that biologists have used a modified polymerase to perform sequencing .
Adding a base to DNA
In the animation shown at right , a string of T's is base paired with a partial complement of A's on an opposing strand .
The DNA polymerase , which is n't shown , is able to add additional nucleotides ( a sugar + base combination ) under two conditions : they 're in the " triphosphate " form , with three phosphate groups in a row , and they base pair successfully with the complementary strand .
As the red highlight indicates , the polymerase causes the hydroxyl group ( OH ) at the end of the existing strand to react with the triphosphate , linking the two together as part of the growing chain .
When that reaction is done , there 's a new hydroxyl group ready to react , allowing the cycle to continue .
By moving down the strand and repeating this reaction , a new molecule of DNA with a specific sequence is created .
From copying to sequencing
From a sequencing perspective , having a new copy of DNA is n't especially helpful .
What we want to know is what the order of the bases along the strand is .
Sequencing works because we can get the process to stop in specific places and identify the base where it stops .
The simplest way to do this is to mess with the chemistry .
Instead of supplying the DNA with a normal nucleotide , it 's possible to synthesize one without the hydroxyl group that the polymerase uses to add the next base .
As the animation here shows , the base can be added to the growing strand normally , but , once in place , the process comes to a crashing halt .
We 've now stopped the process of DNA replication .
Stopping DNA polymerization
Of course , if you supply the polymerase with nothing but terminating bases , it will never get very far .
So , for a sequencing reaction , researchers use a mix of nucleotides where the majority are normal but a small fraction lack the hydroxyl group .
Now , most of the time , the polymerase adds a normal nucleotide , and the reaction continues .
But , at a certain probability , a terminator will be put in place , and the reaction stops .
If you perform this reaction with lots of identical DNA molecules , you 'll wind up with a distribution of lengths that slowly tails off as fewer and fewer unterminated molecules are left .
The point at which this tailing off takes place is dictated by the fraction of terminator nucleotides in the reaction mix .
Now we just need to know what base is present when the reaction stops .
This is possible by making sure that only one of the four nucleotides given to the polymerase can terminate the reaction .
If all the C's , T's and G's are normal , but some fraction of the A's are terminators , then that reaction will produce a population of DNA molecules that all end at A .
By setting up four reactions , one for each base , it 's possible to identify the base at every position .
There are only two more secrets to DNA sequencing .
First , you need to make sure every polymerase starts copying in the same place , otherwise you 'll have a collection of molecules with two randomly located ends .
This part is easy , since DNA polymerases can only add nucleotides to an existing strand .
So , researchers can " prime " the polymerase by seeding the reaction with a short DNA molecule that base pairs with a known sequences that 's next to the one you want to determine .
The other trick is that you need to figure out how long each DNA molecule is in the large mix of reaction products that you 're left with .
The negative charge on phosphates makes this easy , since it ensures that DNA molecules will move when placed in an electric field .
So , if you start the reaction mix on one side of an aqueous polymer mesh ( called a gel ) and run a current through the solution , the DNA will worm its way through the mesh .
Shorter molecules move faster , longer ones slower , allowing the population of molecules to be separated based on their sizes .
By running the four reactions down neighboring lanes on a gel , you 'll get a pattern that looks like the one below , which can be read off to determine the sequence of the DNA molecule .
DNA sequencing .
Given a supply of DNA molecules and primers , the polymerase makes a series of fragments that stop when a terminating base is incorporated .
The fragments appear as bands in one of the four lanes that run across the gel at bottom .
Going high ( er ) throughput
We 're now at the state of the art from when I was a graduate student back in the early 1990s and , trust me , it was anything but artful .
The presence of the DNA , marked by those dark bands , came from a short - lived radioisotope incorporated into the nucleotides .
That meant you had to collect everything involved in the process and pay someone to store it until it decayed to background .
The gels were flexible enough that they would shift or bend at the slightest provocation , making the order of bases difficult to read .
But not so flexible that they would n't tear if suitably disturbed .
All told , it took a full day to create something from which , if you were lucky , you could read two hundred bases down each lane , making each gel good for about a kilobase of sequence .
The human genome is about 3 Gigabases — clearly , this was n't going to cut it , and people were beginning to discuss all manners of exotic approaches , like reading single molecules with a scanning - tunneling microscope .
Fortunately , a couple of changes breathed new life into the old approach .
For starters , people got rid of the radioactivity by replacing it with a fluorescent tag .
Not only was this a whole lot more convenient , but it enabled a simple four - fold improvement in throughput .
Go to any outdoor event , and the glow sticks should indicate that it 's possible to craft molecules that fluoresce in a variety of different colors .
By picking four fluorescent molecules that are decently spread out — blue for G's , green for A's , Yellow for T's and red for C's , for example — and linking them to a specific terminating nucleotide , it 's possible to link the termination position with the identity of the base there .
What once required four separate reactions could now be run at once in a single solution .
The next trick was to get rid of most of the gel .
As we noted above , molecules work their way through the gel based on their size , but you needed a long gel if you wanted to image a lot of them at once .
The solution , it turned out , was not to image them at once — something that , before the switch from radioactivity to fluorescence , was n't really possible .
All you really need is just enough gel to separate things out slightly .
You can put a gate at the end of the gel and image the fluorescent activity there .
One by one , based on their size , the different molecules will pass through the gate , and glow a specific color based on the base at that position .
Instead of a couple hundred bases , it was now possible to get about 700 bases of sequence from a single reaction .
Thanks to digital imaging , the data , an example of which is shown below , was easy to interpret .
Sequences came as a computer file , ready to be plugged into various analysis programs .
The data generated by fluorescent DNA sequencing .
With all of these in place , DNA sequencing was ready to for the same sorts of processes that revolutionized many areas of technology : automation and miniaturization .
Instead of a grad student or technician painstakingly adding everything that was needed into individual tubes , a robot could dispense all the reaction ingredients into a small plastic plate that could hold about 100 individual samples .
A second robot could then pull the samples and deposit them into a machine that read out the sequencing information .
Large gels were replaced by narrow capillaries .
The new sequencing machines could do all of this for many samples in parallel , and the larger sequencing centers had dozens of these machines .
As the bottlenecks were opened wider , the human genome project shot past its planned schedule , and a flood of genomes followed .
But with the increased progress came increased expectations .
Ultimately , researchers did n't just want to have a human genome , but the ability to sequence any human genome , from an individual with a genetic disease to the genome of a cancer cell , in order to personalize medicine .
That , once again , has set off a race for new and exotic sequencing technology .
We 'll discuss the first wave of these so - called " next generation " sequencers in a future installment .

Q. Flavio Briatore was your manager .
What are the consequences for you now that he 's not allowed in F1 anymore ?
Heikki Kovalainen :
Of course it 's a little bit of an unusual situation and something that I certainly did not expect to happen , but obviously I will have to comply with the FIA .
Apart from that , we are here this weekend to race and we focus on racing .
Q . Do you think the decision was too hard on Flavio and not enough on Renault ?
HK : The FIA made a decision and I have nothing more to say .
We need to move on and focus on racing again .
Q. Flavio was a special character , do you think Formula 1 will miss him ?
HK : I do n't know .
People have different opinions .
We 'll see .
Q . How do you expect the car to perform this weekend ?
HK : I think we should be competitive .
We have a decent upgrade in the car .
We have a new floor and a front wing and then some small aero bits , so we should have more downforce in the car .
This should be one of the better weekends .
We have been pretty good in other types of circuits like Monza , and even at Spa I think the performance of the car in qualifying was not so bad .
So I think it 's a decent , all - round package that we have now .
Q . Are you impressed by the turnaround considering the poor start of the season ?
HK : Yeah , for sure .
It 's been very impressive , and a lot of hard work has been done by the team .
Obviously first we needed to analyse what the problem was .
We knew early on about the aerodynamic problem that we had in the car and that somehow the package was not delivering what it should do .
It took us a little while , but then for Lewis in Nurburgring and for myself in Hungary the package that we got was a different philosophy .
Straight away the front of the car started to work better and the rear also .
And since then we have been putting more performance into the car and it's been very impressive .
Q . What do you think of the new pit entry and the chicane ?
HK : I think they look okay .
I do n't think they will be any problem .
Last year the pit entry itself was a little bit tricky but that has been sorted as well , so the cars should not be travelling at such different speeds now .
That 's the most important thing , that 's better now .
Q . You had a difficult time at Renault and you were under pressure .
What would your reaction have been if Flavio had asked you to crash to help the team ?
HK : I would never do it , but I was never asked that kind of question .
Q. Did you speak to Flavio after the verdict ?
HK : Not yet .
Myself and Lewis have been pretty busy so I have n't actually had a chance to talk to him .
Q. Is it frustrating that you have been dragged into it ?
HK : There 's nothing I could have done about it , so I have to go on accordingly .
Q. Have you been surprised ?
HK : Everybody has been surprised about the whole scandal .
I do n't think it 's very normal to have these kind of incidents in Formula 1 .
I think it 's unusual .
In my opinion Formula 1 is still a fair sport and if you do something bad you will always be caught .
Q . You said you would n't do it , but can you understand another driver doing it ?
HK : For me this is a separate issue and I do n't want to drag myself into it too much .
But I certainly would n't do it .
Q . But you know Flavio puts a lot of pressure on his drivers .
HK : If he had asked me to crash the car I would definitely had said no .
But like I said , I never had a problem like that .
Q . Are you happy with your form ?
HK : I think in Monza the result could have been better .
I think it was quite clear that the beginning of the race was a disaster for me .
In the first two , three laps I lost the whole race , and I struggled to get the tyres going so I think it was probably the wrong decision .
But it happens .
It was partly my decision .
I thought it was the right thing to do and I was convinced I would be fighting for victory .
The qualifying has always been good and I think the race performance in Valencia , apart from the last stint and both stints at Spa , were very strong .
So I 'm pleased about the performance and of course I want to win a race this year , that 's my target and we try to do this again this weekend again .
Q. In February Ron Dennis said you would be the surprise of the season .
You think you made it ?
HK : I do n't think at that point we were thinking of qualifying 14th or 16th in Melbourne .
We were thinking to be on pole position .
My performance has been relatively good compared to last year .
I 'm driving better than last year .
My performance compared to Lewis has been stronger than last year , but unfortunately you do n't see it when you are driving in 14th .
I feel now that we have a car with which we can achieve good results I 'm fully focused on doing that .
I want to get a good result for the team .
If you asked me this question three races later hopefully I can say that yes .
Q . Do you think you 've reached the level of performance of Lewis ?
HK : I think so , yeah .
I think in the last few races the performance has been really strong , but there 's been incidents every time slowing me down at various points in the races .
But I think the performance is good enough .
It can always be better and Lewis is a tough team - mate , but I have no problems and I 'm never worried about having a tough team - mate .
It 's always good and when I manage to beat him I 'm normally very near to the top of the grid .
In this post , we will look a little more at these articles , and see why peak oil , and perhaps the financial issues associated with peak oil , are still an issue , regardless of what these articles may suggest .
It is behind a pay wall ( you can get it for $ 5.95 ) .
There is also a draft version available on line .
Its premise seems to be that there are a lot of promising areas that we have not yet explored .
When you put this together with advances in drilling and the promises of secondary and tertiary recovery , there is a good chance that oil production will not peak for many years .
It talks about the many discoveries this year , and how , if they continue at the pace they have in the first half , they will be the best since 2000 .
Recently , we have had two new articles aiming to put to rest people 's fears about peak oil .
One is from the New York Times :
New York Times Article
A few excerpts from Oil Industry Sets a Brisk Pace of New Discoveries
NY Times :
It is normal for companies to discover billions of barrels of new oil every year , but this year ’s pace is unusually brisk .
New oil discoveries have totaled about 10 billion barrels in the first half of the year , according to IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates .
If discoveries continue at that pace through year - end , they are likely to reach the highest level since 2000 .
Two times 10 billion barrels of oil is 20 billion barrels of oil .
Twenty billion barrels of oil divided by 365 is only 54.8 million barrels a day -- not nearly enough , if we are currently using 72 million barrels of crude oil a day .
If 10 billion barrels is an unusually large amount in the first half , the likelihood of having equal success in the second half by luck is not very good .
NY Times :
While recent years have featured speculation about a coming peak and subsequent decline in oil production , people in the industry say there is still plenty of oil in the ground , especially beneath the ocean floor , even if finding and extracting it is becoming harder .
They say that prices and the pace of technological improvement remain the principal factors governing oil production capacity .
There are a lot of issues with difficult to extract oil beneath the ocean floor .
While it is theoretically possible for the oil price to be high enough to extract this oil , there is a real issue with too high an oil price ( resulting in wholesale oil costs of over 4 % of GDP ) causing a major recession .
Currently , such an oil price is about $ 80 per barrel .
So it is not clear that prices can go enough higher , and stay enough higher , for extraction .
The more difficult to extract oil also has severe challenges in terms of the amount of up front investment needed , and the long time delay before it will actually come to market .
For the new very deep ocean " finds ' , it could be 10 years or more before we will actually get the oil extracted .
By then , our oil needs , if economies continue to grow , will be much higher than today .
NY Times :
Since the early 1980s , discoveries have failed to keep up with the global rate of oil consumption , which last year reached 31 billion barrels of oil .
Instead , companies have managed to expand production by finding new ways of getting more oil out of existing fields , or producing oil through unconventional sources , like Canada ’s tar sands or heavy oil in Venezuela .
Companies have n't managed to expand production .
Crude oil production has been on a plateau since 2005 .
That is the problem .
Figure 1 . Graph of world crude oil production , based on EIA data .
* 2009 data is average through june 30 , 2009 .
In Figure 1 , note that oil production has not risen significantly since 2005 .
This happened , despite rising prices .
Figure 2 . EIA graph of West Texas Intermediate oil prices .
Graph of world crude oil production , based on EIA data .
* 2009 data is average through June 30 , 2009 .
In Figure 2 , note that even when oil prices rose far above their historical average price of $ 20 barrel in the 2003 to 2008 period , oil production in Figure 1 rose very little -- virtually none after 2005 .
In fact , it was the lack of rise in production that was a major driver of higher prices .
When prices finally dropped , there is significant evidence that it was related to high oil prices indirectly causing problems with credit markets .
Figure 3 . US Consumer Credit Outstanding based on Federal Reserve data .
In Figure 3 , note that US consumer credit reached its peak in July 2008 , precisely the same month oil prices reached their peak .
Once credit started contracting , purchase of goods that required oil in their manufacture ( such as cars ) dropped .
The drop in oil price reflected the inability of purchasers to continue buying products that used oil in their manufacture .
If credit had continued to expand , it is possible oil prices would have continued to rise further , but still with virtually no increase in oil supply .
NY Times :
Reserve estimates typically rise over the life of a field , which can often be productive for decades , as companies find new ways of getting more oil out of the ground .
Maybe , maybe not .
We do n't have very good knowledge of reserves around the world .
In many places , particularly the Middle East , the reserves seem to be quite inflated .
If reserve estimates are starting out from an inflated base , it is doubtful they will increase .
They may still be overstated , even with huge improvements in technology .
One of the big issues is whether new technology can be implemented cheaply enough to keep the prices to a level that the consumer can afford .
If new technology can only be implemented at $ 150 a barrel , and the economy starts crashing at $ 80 or $ 90 barrel , the new technology really may not be all that useful .
NY Times :
" The industry ’s record has improved in recent years , thanks to high prices .
According to Cambridge Energy Research Associates , oil companies have found more oil than they produced for the last two years through a combination of exploration and field expansions .
This comment is strange .
Cambridge Energy Research Associates ( CERA ) is part of IHS , and IHS was quoted as saying :
In 2008 , world oil reserves declined nearly 3 % , primarily due to a 5.2 billion bbl decline in revisions that stemmed from reduced commodity prices .
World oil reserves ( excluding oil sands ) were 1,261 billion barrels at the end of 2007 , according to British Petroleum .
A 3 % decline would amount to about 38 billion barrels -- more than the 20 billion barrels hoped for this year in new discoveries .
Another question is how a 5.2 billion barrel decline ( from reduced commodity prices , as stated by IHS ) could cause most of this decrease , if we are talking about a $ 30 + billion decrease .
One wonders whether the IHS statement really was intended to apply to some subset of world oil reserves .
Perhaps the CERA statement should also be interpreted to apply to some subset of world reserves .
It is possible the CERA statement about reserve replacement may also apply to oil and gas reserves on a combined basis , since companies generally give their oil and gas reserves on a combined " barrel of oil equivalent " basis .
These quotes regarding reserves illustrate how difficult it is to interpret statements found in newspapers about reserves .
The reporters often do n't understand quite what they are talking about , so the quote does n't quite get all of the specifics needed to understand what is being described .
If someone wants reserve replacement to sound favorable , he or she can often find a way to word the statement so it sounds good , whether or not the details really add up to an increase .
Price is important in all of this .
If the price of oil is n't high enough , reserves may not be developed .
But if the price of oil is too high , it may sink the economy , and the reserves still may not be developed .
Scientific American Article
Figure 4 . October 2009 Scientific American graphic illustrating areas that have allegedly not been adequately explored .
This graphic alleges that much of the world 's oil deposits have not adequately been explored with modern technology .
It seems to me that one does n't really need modern technology to get at large reservoirs in easy to reach locations .
It is only when one is looking for either very small deposits , or deposits in locations that are difficult to extract from that modern technology really is needed .
We are n't likely to find any more Saudi Arabias , whether or not we have fancy new equipment .
The issue that arises with deposits that are in difficult to reach locations , like thousands of feet under the sea , and then under a salt dome as well , is that the oil found in those locations is almost always very expensive to extract .
It is hard to believe that even with new technologies that will change -- it is the location that makes oil extraction so difficult .
New technology may make extraction a little easier , but it is still likely to be expensive .
Scientific American also has a graphic on tertiary recovery techniques .
It says :
After primary and secondary recovery have run their course , more aggressive methods , some of them still experimental , can soften the remaining oil so it can flow toward the wells .
Because these advanced methods are expensive , the battle to get more out only gets this fierce when resale prices are sufficiently high .
incendiary
Burning part of a reservoir ( which requires injecting air underground ) enhances the recovery rate in three ways .
First , heat from the fire makes oil less viscous .
Second , the combustion produces carbon dioxide , which pushes oil out .
Third , the fire breaks the larger and heavier molecules of oil , making it more mobile .
Chemical
Substances called surfactants , injected into a reservoir , help oil detach from the rock and flow better .
Layers of surfactant engulf oil into droplets , similar to the way ordinary soap washes oily materials off a surface .
A variation consists of injecting chemicals that generate the soaplike materials from components present within the oil itself .
Biological
Experiments are testing the injection of bacteria ( together with nutrients and , in some cases , oxygen ) that grow in the interface between the oil and the rock , helping to release the oil .
The bacteria are allowed to grow for several days before recovery resumes .
In the future , genetically engineered microorganisms could partially digest the most viscous oil and thin it out .
Here again , the issue is price .
Can these techniques be implemented cheaply enough that they can be used without raising the price of oil so high that the price is beyond what consumers can afford ?
More on the Financial Issues Involved
Figure 5 . Dave Murphy 's graphic from this post .
Dave Murphy showed a graphic earlier this year that illustrated the relationship between oil prices and recession .
In this graphic , Dave uses retail prices to determine his percentage of GDP .
The threshold for retail oil prices seems to be about 5.5 % of GDP ( equivalent to 4 % wholesale ) .
The dollar per barrel cut off for causing a recession seems to be in the $ 80 to $ 90 barrel range .
It will be hard to maintain an oil price at a level that sends the US ( and the world ) into recession .
While we usually think of oil production as being limited by geology , it seems to me that the weak link is really finances .
What tends to happen is that when the price of oil gets very high , people change their purchasing patterns .
People continue to buy oil products , because they need transportation to work .
People also continue to buy food , and it also is a heavy user of oil .
What people cut back on is expenses that can be deferred -- buying a new larger house , buying a new car , going to a restaurant , contributions to charities .
This cutback in expenditures causes recessionary impacts .
As things get worse , some debt holders start defaulting on their debt .
This might be restaurant owners who have less business , and because of this can't pay their debt .
It might be homeowners with long commutes , who cannot pay both their mortgage payments and the cost of gasoline for their long commutes .
It might be governments who cannot collect enough taxes , because of dropping demand ( and lower prices ) for houses in their suburb .
It might be a charity with lower contributions .
Eventually , the debt defaults result in a cut - back in credit like we saw in Figure 3 , because of the adverse impact of the debt defaults on lenders .
Once there is a cutback in credit , consumers are no longer able to purchase as many cars and other durable goods .
These durable goods require oil in their manufacture .
With fewer purchases of goods using oil in their manufacture , the demand for oil drops .
Because of the drop in demand for oil , oil prices drop again , allowing the economy to recover a bit , as it is doing now .
But as the economy recovers , demand begins to grow again .
With the rise in demand , oil prices are likely to rise again to a level where they have an adverse impact on the economy .
The world economic system was damaged pretty badly with the last price spike .
Another spike could have much more adverse results .
Eventually , the world economy may become so damaged by oil price spikes that recovery of the world economy in the form we now know it may not be possible .
I do n't know how this will work out .
There could be huge international defaults .
The result might be each country more on its own , with much less international trade , because countries would no longer trust each other for credit .
Globalization could start unwinding .
How soon such a scenario would might occur is not certain , but it seems to me that a scenario like this , rather than the amount of reserves in the ground , is likely to determine how much oil is ultimately produced .
Some countries may be able to keep up production for a while , even with a world financial crisis , but eventually oil producing companies are likely to run into barriers -- parts they need for equipment that they cannot obtain , or lack of trained people to perform needed services ( because such services were formerly done by an international trade partner ) .
It would be nice if there were a guarantee that came with oil reserves as currently reported that we really will be able to extract the oil that they represent .
It seems to me this will be the case :
(1) If the world economy stays together ,
(2) If the price of oil stays in a zone that is neither too high to crush the economy , nor too low to discourage the expensive investment needed for getting the oil out , and
(3) If there are enough investment dollars available , for the sizable front end investment required to produce the oil .
Those are three pretty big " if "s .
Without them , it seems like oil production will be very difficult .
The Most Outrageous U.S. Lies About Global Healthcare
NO HEALTH CARE FOR HAWKING OR KENNEDY
Jim Watson / AFP / Getty Images
The lie : Stephen Hawking ( who has Lou Gehrig ’s disease ) and U.S. Sen.
Edward Kennedy ( who has brain cancer ) would not receive treatment in Britain , which has a government - run health - care system .
The liars :
An editorial in Investor ’s Business Daily on July 31 claimed : “ People such as scientist Stephen Hawking would n’t have a chance in the U.K. , where the National Health Service [ NHS ] would say the life of this brilliant man , because of his physical handicaps , is essentially worthless . ”
U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa — the senior - most Republican on the Senate Finance Committee , which must approve health - care bills — said Aug. 5 during a radio interview with Iowa City ’s KCJJ , “ Ted Kennedy — with a brain tumor , being 77 years old as opposed to being 37 years old — if he were in England , would not be treated for his disease because … when you get to be 77 , your life is considered less valuable under those systems . ”
The debunking :
In both cases , this is nonsense .
Hawking , who is British , receives intensive treatment for his degenerative motor neuron disease at a local Cambridge hospital .
Upon hearing the rumors of his non-treatment , the prizewinning theoretical physicist told The Guardian , “ I would n’t be here today if it were not for the NHS .
I have received a large amount of high - quality treatment without which I would not have survived . ”
In Kennedy ’s case , it is true that Britain assesses the cost - effectiveness of procedures and medicines before deciding whether to prescribe them .
And the NHS does deny some procedures and drugs based on considerations such as the severity of a patient ’s sickness , the cost of treatment , and the quality of life afforded .
But doctors and NHS officials have stressed that Britons with Kennedy ’s condition , regardless of age , would receive aggressive treatment , including surgery , radiation therapy , and chemotherapy .
The chief executive of Britain ’s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) , which determines the rationing system , told The Guardian , “ It is neither true nor is it anything you could extrapolate from anything we ’ve ever recommended ” that Kennedy would be denied treatment by the NHS .
Thus far , neither Kennedy nor Grassley have commented since Grassley ’s initial remark .
CANADIANS HEAD TO THE UNITED STATES FOR URGENT CARE
Flickr user no22a
The lie : Canada ’s government - run health care is so bad that needy patients need to pay for care in the United States .
The liars :
The advocacy group Patients United Now is running a television ad featuring Ontario resident Shona Holmes , who claims , “ I survived a brain tumor , but if I had relied on my government health care , I ’d be dead . ”
She says she traveled to the United States for lifesaving treatment .
In June , Sen. Mitch McConnell , a Kentucky Republican , said , “ For cardiac bypass surgery , patients in Ontario are told they may have to wait six months for a surgery that Americans can often get right away . ”
The debunking : Holmes did indeed pay $ 100,000 for care she received from Minnesota ’s famed Mayo Clinic , considered one of the best medical centers in the world .
But Holmes ’ treatment was not a lifesaving anti-cancer measure .
The Mayo Clinic ’s own Web site explains that she had a cyst — not a brain tumor — which was not necessarily life - threatening .
( It also explains that Mayo is a nonprofit cooperative and strongly supports health - care reform . )
In general , Canadians are not flocking south for health care , and for good reason .
According to a report from the Fraser Institute , a prominent Canadian think tank , both the Canadian and U.S. governments spend about 7 percent of their GDPs on health - care costs .
( The United States , including private expenditure , spends about 16 percent of GDP on health care . )
But all Canadians are covered for all medical care , plus some prescription drug costs .
In the United States , 47 million are uninsured , and hundreds of thousands declare bankruptcy every year due to medical bills .
There are wait times in Canada , but nobody waits for emergency surgery ; McConnell ’s claim about bypass patients is untrue .
In 2007 , a non-emergency patient in Ontario waited about 61 days for elective bypass surgery , according to Canada ’s health service .
Such collected data is not made public in the United States .
HEALTH CARE IN EUROPE ONLY WORKS BECAUSE OF SINGLE - PAYER
Alex Wong / Getty Images
The lie : European countries all have long - standing single - payer systems — which is why their health - care systems work .
The liar : Howard Dean , the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee , recently said , “ The Europeans all have single - payer [ systems ] because essentially their health - care systems were destroyed during World War II .
And they went to a single payer … and then it turned out they loved it and did n’t want to get away from it afterwards . ”
The debunking : This is an overgeneralization .
Europe has a broad range of health - care systems and health insurance plans ; not all European countries are single - payer .
It ’s an amorphous term , but usually denotes a system in which the government pays the medical bills , but doctors and hospitals are private , such as in Canada , France , and Germany .
( In socialized systems , such as Britain ’s NHS or the U.S. Veterans Affairs Department , the government pays the doctors and owns the hospitals . )
Rather than a single post - World War II wave of health - care reform , numerous European countries have experimented to find systems that work .
For instance , both Switzerland ( in 1994 ) and the Netherlands ( in 2006 ) moved to models the United States is now considering .
Hospitals , doctors , and insurers are for - profit and private .
But the systems are highly regulated , and insurance is mandatory and government - subsidized .
CANADA AND BRITAIN MAKE YOUR HEALTH CARE CHOICES FOR YOU
The lie :
In Canada and Britain , individuals lose the right to make their own health - care choices .
The liars :
The advocacy group Club for Growth and the Republican National Committee ( RNC )
The debunking : Both the RNC and the conservative Club for Growth have warned that a government takeover of health care would put a bureaucrat in between patient and doctor — as in Britain and Canada .
The latter group ’s ad ominously announces : “ $ 22,750 .
In England , government officials decided that ’s how much six months of life is worth .
Under their socialized system , if a medical treatment costs more , you ’re out of luck . ”
This is not true .
Patients in Canada and Britain retain autonomy to help decide upon their courses of treatment and to choose their own doctors .
In England , the $ 22,750 figure represents not what “ six months of life is worth , ” but the price at which the NICE determines a single drug is not cost - effective .
Exceptions to the ceiling are permitted in some cases ; and Britons retain the option to pay for private care .
( In which case , rationing occurs as it does in the United States : Those with ability to pay do so . )
The system is designed to prevent one of the key reasons for high health costs in the United States :
With limited medical knowledge , patients assume the most expensive option is the best .
A NICE representative told The Guardian the ad is “ a gross misrepresentation of how [ the agency ] applies health economics to try and address the central issue : how to allocate health care rationally within the context of limited health - care resources . ”
THE UNITED STATES HAS THE BEST HEALTH CARE IN THE WORLD
John Moore / Getty Images
The lie : The United States has the best health care in the world .
The liars : A slew of U.S. presidents , politicians , journalists , commentators , and everyday citizens
The debunking :
There is one yardstick by which U.S. health care distinguishes itself : cost .
The United States spends more — in total dollars , percentage of GDP , and per capita — than every other country on Earth .
On virtually every other broad metric , the claim that U.S. health care stands for global excellence is demonstrably false .
The United States does n’t take a top spot in either the World Health Organization or nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund rankings .
The American health - care system is not best in terms of coverage , access , patient safety , efficiency , or cost - effectiveness .
It does not produce the best outcomes for diseases such as cancer , heart disease , or diabetes ; for the elderly , the middle - aged , or the young ; or in terms of life expectancy , rates of chronic diseases , or obesity .
Which countries do come out on top ?
Often — France , Switzerland , Britain , Canada , and Japan .
On the World Health Organization ’s list , the United States comes out 37th .
It ’s not exactly “ Big Love , ” but New York ’s tough divorce laws have made Matthew Gerber an unwitting “ bigamist . ”
Gerber was granted a divorce five years ago , and then remarried .
But because New York is the only state left in the nation without a “ no fault ” law , his first wife appealed and a court overturned the divorce , leaving them legally hitched .
Gerber and his second wife , Maria — who live upstate with twin toddlers — hope their unusual plight prods lawmakers to finally reform New York ’s divorce system .
“ I was unhappy .
My marriage was broken , ” Gerber said of his first union , which lasted nine years .
But misery or incompatibility alone are not grounds for divorce in New York state .
Unless a couple agrees to separate for a year , it takes mudslinging .
A spouse must prove the other had an affair , refused sex for a year or was guilty of “ cruel and inhuman treatment , ” as Gerber alleged .
Gerber , 49 , would not discuss his divorce , but lawyers said he cited less - than - horrendous reasons for the split — like bickering over what color to paint a room and his wife ’s refusal to hold hands in public .
“ She was constantly criticizing his decisions , and it was getting under his skin , ” said his former lawyer , Peter Bloom .
“ It was all nonsense , but it got to the point where he could n’t deal with it anymore . ”
Gerber ’s first wife , Ingrid , 54 , contested his case .
“ I think she still loved him and wanted to try to be true to the vow she took , ” said her lawyer , Peter Hickey .
A state Supreme Court judge granted the divorce in June 2004 .
But Ingrid appealed , and won a reversal in February 2005 — three months after Gerber married Maria Costa , 39 .
In a public opinion , the appellate judges said Matthew ’s testimony that Ingrid “ made him feel . . . agitated , annoyed and bothered ” was n’t enough .
They found “ no evidence that her conduct created any threat to his health or safety . ”
“ It was a big shock , ” Matthew said .
The ruling in effect voided his second marriage .
Now he ca n’t claim Maria as a dependant .
They ca n’t jointly file tax returns .
Their twins were born in a legal limbo .
In a pleading letter to legislators , the couple say they ’ve spent a bundle on lawyers but his first wife “ refuses to negotiate . ”
Ingrid , a corporate finance specialist who lives in Brooklyn , earns more than Matthew and had no kids with him .
Sondra Miller , a retired judge who chaired a state committee on divorce reform , said no statistics exist but a “ significant number ” of divorces are denied by judges statewide who find insufficient grounds .
“ I am convinced the families of New York suffer grievous harm for the lack of a no - fault law , ” Miller said .

Google Wave is another grab for the Holy Grail of collaborative computing .
But , will it be more successful than previous attempts ?
Whenever you see something compared to Lotus Notes , as Google Wave has been , you know to expect an uphill slog .
Add a comparison to Microsoft Groove , which I have not seen but seems reasonable , and you can expect deep trouble .
Both Notes and Groove are wonderful , innovative applications that have never caught on as I had hoped .
Why ?
They are too difficult to use and develop for .
They were way ahead of their time .
Maybe Google Wave , a workplace collaboration application that is being rolled out to an additional 100,000 beta testers , has arrived at the right time , finding the right mix of power vs. ease - of - use , and the right metaphor for delivering it .
We have an excellent story that offers " Five Reasons To Dive Into Google Wave . "
That is , if you can find a way to get into the beta .
The big question : Can Google
Wave succeed where seemingly every collaboration application that has gone has failed ?
I would love to say yes , but these applications have been a heartbreak for me .
Lotus Notes is , arguably , one of the coolest applications ever .
Likewise Groove , another gem from the fertile mind of Microsoft 's Ray Ozzie .
Yet , both are what I call " head scratcher " applications .
In that , after looking at them , people are prone to scratch their heads and wonder , " What can I do with that ? "
Then , once they decide , realize that Lotus Notes and Groove implementations are not nearly as easy to accomplish and they hoped .
Wave may have solved this problem .
The user interface makes sense , from what I have seen , and it does not seem to overreach , which is a problem both Notes and Groove suffer from .
At the same time , Google 's online applications are not particularly inspiring .
Sure , Gmail offers neat filters , but that is n't much to hang an app on .
Wave needs to be much more exciting than what Google has done so far if it is to succeed big time .
Nevertheless , success is out there .
Collaboration really is a Holy Grail of software .
Everyone knows they need to collaborate better and most think a computer should be able to help .
If Google Wave is the collaboration platform that people have been waiting on , Google 's success as a search engine may become known as its second - greatest accomplishment .

By now everybody must know that the top banking executives responsible for our economic meltdown have no shame .
Otherwise they would not have dared give themselves such hefty bonuses as a deeply perverse reward for actions that caused millions of Americans to lose their jobs and homes .
The $ 33 billion that the executives of the nine banks bailed out with taxpayer funds paid themselves in 2008 is all one needs to know about the depth of their amorality .
But it also speaks volumes about the inefficiency of a system of rewards that has nothing to do with performance .
“ No Rhyme or Reason : the ‘ Heads I Win , Tails You Lose ’ Bank Bonus Culture ” is the title of the report by New York ’s Attorney Gen. Andrew M. Cuomo unmasking this scandal .
It concludes : “ … compensation for bank employees has become unmoored from the banks ’ financial performance . ”
That would not be of public concern if bank executives and their stockholders would bear the full price of such folly .
But not one of those top nine banks that distributed bonuses of at least $ 1 million to each of 5,000 top executives faced the consequences on their own .
Instead , taxpayers were called upon to pony up what will eventually be trillions of dollars to save the banks and the nation from this disaster .
As the Cuomo report notes :
“ Two firms , Citigroup and Merrill Lynch suffered massive loses of more than $ 27 billion at each firm .
Nevertheless , Citigroup paid out $ 5.33 billion , in bonuses , and Merrill paid $ 3.6 billion in bonuses .
Together , they lost $ 54 billion , paid out nearly $ 9 billion in bonuses and then received TARP bailouts totaling $ 55 billion .
For three other firms — Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley , and J.P. Morgan Chase — 2008 bonus payments were substantially greater than the banks ’ net income . ”
In each instance , those bonuses on average more than doubled earnings and were in turn more than doubled by the government bailout in TARP funds .
Those funds , and the nonrefundable tens of billions passed on through the AIG bailout and other government programs , come from the very taxpayers already reeling from a banking collapse brought on by reckless lending practices .
Yet the $ 306 billion in toxic assets that Citigroup — a leader in the irresponsible practices that created such “ assets ” — managed to pile up are also now guaranteed by taxpayer funds .
And being on the public dole did n’t prevent Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit from “ earning ” $ 38 million last year .
The Merrill Lynch bonuses were paid as the company was about to collapse .
It was saved at the last minute by being purchased for $ 50 billion by Bank of America in a deal engineered by the federal government and facilitated by $ 45 billion in bailout funds to BofA .
On Monday , Bank of America agreed to pay $ 33 million in penalties to the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle an SEC complaint that BofA had deceived shareholders about those billions in bonuses .
One of those handsomely rewarded was Thomas Montag , now with BofA , who received a $ 39.4 million bonus for his work at Merrill Lynch , a reward for his performance as Merrill ’s trading and sales chief , a position in which he presided over the billions in mortgage acquisitions that fueled the company ’s downfall .
The banks , considered “ too big to fail , ” were quickly showered with enormous amounts of money , contributing to a U.S. deficit expected to grow to $ 1.86 trillion this year .
But homeowners are not too big to fail , and they were left to the tender mercies of the very bankers who swindled them with flaky mortgages .
On Tuesday , the Treasury Department criticized the major banks for their abysmally weak effort to aid distressed homeowners who are more than 60 days delinquent on their mortgages .
Only 9 percent of those who qualify for assistance under President Obama ’s foreclosure prevention plan have been entered into trial programs to determine whether their mortgages will be modified .
BofA , one of the major holders of distressed mortgages , has entered only a scant 4 percent of its eligible mortgage holders in the program .
Citigroup has managed to begin the process with 15 percent of those eligible , while Wells Fargo has begun with only 6 percent of its eligible borrowers .
Compare that snail speed in helping folks keep their homes with the alacrity with which the federal government responded in bailing out the banks when they got into trouble .
The choice from the beginning of this debacle has been :
Do we bail out the banks that caused the problem in the hopes that they will help ordinary folks or do we start with government relief for distressed mortgage holders ?
The decision to aid the bankers first was based on the assumption that for the first time in their lives they would do the honorable thing and surrender space in the lifeboats to those most vulnerable .
Her report stated : " There was no ongoing armed attack by Russia before the start of the Georgian operation .
Georgian claims of a large - scale presence of Russian armed forces in South Ossetia prior to the Georgian offensive could not be substantiated by the mission .
It could also not be verified that Russia was on the verge of such a major attack . "
Goldman Sachs The Fourth Branch of the U.S. Government
Quietly and almost unnoticed by most Americans , the US Federal Government introduced a fourth branch to its political structure in 2006 .
As you know we already had three branches , they are :
The Judicial : the Supreme Court
The Judicial : the Supreme Court The Executive : the President
The Legislative : Congress
This pretty much has us covered in terms of political strategy … but what about financial issues ?
Everyone knows Congress has no clue how to allocate capital .
And the Executive Branch does n’t exactly have a great track record when it comes to financial matters either ( we ’ve run a deficit virtually every year since 1970 ) .
Should n’t we have a Financial Branch of government ?
A group of fiscal experts entirely devoted to keeping the US ’s fiscal house in order ?
Well , we actually do , but instead of installing a branch of smart , genuine financiers interested in benefiting the American people , we installed a bunch of greedy crooks intent on stealing as much of the public ’s money as possible with no consequences what so ever .
Ladies and Gentleman , I present to you America ’s Financial Branch of the Government : Goldman Sachs .
Trying to detail exactly how integrated Goldman has become to the Federal Government would be like trying to track the peanut butter swirls in Ben and Jerry ’s Chocolate Peanut Butter Swirl ice cream .
Indeed , with the exception of Ben Bernanke and a few other officials , Goldman Sachs provided all the lead characters for the Tragic Comedy that is our latest Financial Crisis .
Central to the entire mess is Hank “ the Hammer ” Paulson , our former Public Money Privatizer or Secretary of the Treasury as he is commonly known .
To chronicle the full intricacy of Paulson ’s web of cronies and the methods he used to funnel public funds to them and their business during the Crisis would require a book , not an essay .
However , one can draw a great deal of conclusions about Paulson ’s central beliefs on business and politics by mentioning that one of his first positions of power was serving as assistant to John Erlichman , the central architect of Richard Nixon ’s Watergate Scandal : a man who believed that when it came to wining seats of power , it ’s best to break and enter , steal , and destroy one ’s enemies at all costs .
Erlichman was convicted on conspiracy , obstruction of justice and perjury .
Paulson went on to become CEO of Goldman Sachs .
Beyond Paulson , Goldman ’s reach in this crisis is virtually unending .
John Thain , former CEO of Merrill Lynch was a former Goldmanite .
So was Robert Rubin , the Chairman of Citigroup .
Then there ’s Robert Steel , the head of Wachovia , Ed Liddy , who Paulson put in charge of the nationalized AIG , Mark Patterson , the current Treasury Chief of Staff , Neel Kashkari , the guy in charge of allocating TARP funds …
heck , even Tim Geithner was mentored by the afore - mentioned Robert Rubin .
What ’s staggering is that no one seems outraged by all of this .
It ’s not too difficult to connect the dots on what happened : a former Goldman exec was put in charge of allocating public funds to other former Goldman execs who in turn allocated the funds to their employees in the form of bonuses and enormous salaries .
Indeed , it ’s telling that Paulson ’s original proposal for the $ 800 billion bailout entailed NO curtailing or oversight of executive compensation at the firm ’s receiving our money .
I ’m starting to run out of room here .
But if you ’re interested in these issues and learning more about Goldman Sach ’s involvement in our Federal Government , I STRONGLY urge you to read Matt Taibbi ’s recent expose on the firm in Rolling Stone magazine .
Be forewarned , you will be infuriated by what Taibbi reveals .
But if it gets people contacting their local representatives and Senators asking why we have n’t launched any investigations into Paulson ’s allocation of public funds .
You can see Taibbi ’s article online at : http://zerohedge.blogspot.com/2009/06/goldman-sachs-engineering-every-major.html

The mayor prefers to travel on his bicycle London Mayor Boris Johnson 's expenses have come into focus after it emerged that his taxi bill submitted to City Hall was almost half the actual cost .
In the expenses reported to the Greater London Authority 's ( GLA ) audit panel Mr Johnson claimed £ 1,900 for taxi rides between April 2008 and January 2009 .
But the full detailed account of his taxi bill seen by BBC London puts the figure at £ 4,280 for the same period .
The mayor 's office cited " slowness in invoices being presented " as the cause .
The audit panel has said it is " concerned " about the delay .
Mr Johnson 's expenses were highlighted on the same day that his former deputy for external affairs , Ian Clement , was reported to the Metropolitan Police over claims of misusing a corporate credit card .
Mr Clement , who stepped down on Monday , admitted spending £ 2,300 on personal items with his City Hall card .
Taxi rides ' approved ' Regarding Mr Johnson 's taxi expenses , the detailed account shows he ran up a bill of £ 100 on each of 10 taxi journeys within London .
On two occasions the bill went over £ 200 for events attended by the mayor in Bexleyheath , south - east London , and in Edmonton , north London .
It has been suggested that the taxi may have been kept waiting .
The accounts also show the mayor taking taxis from his home in Islington , north London , to the City Hall and on other occasions from work to home .
The GLA 's staff guidelines state that a taxi can be kept waiting for a maximum of 20 minutes , and that a ride home or vice - versa should happen only in exceptional circumstances .
The latest figures show only 11 taxis were booked between January and March
Mayor 's spokesman Mr Johnson said : " As far as I know some of these taxi bills referred to are journeys that I had taken to places to do engagements with , for instance , the people 's question time or whatever it happens to be .
" They have all , as far as I know , been approved in the normal way , " he said .
A spokesperson for Mr Johnson said : " The mayor 's preferred mode of transport is his bike which accounts for the vast majority of his personal and official journeys .
" On occasions , however , over the past 14 months taking taxis has been unavoidable .
That is very much the exception and the figures show he takes fewer than three taxis a week on average .
" Most of the taxis in this bill were booked in the first few months of his administration when he attended a huge number of events often going to two and three in a row on a tight schedule .
" His use of taxis has declined steadily from the start of this year .
The latest figures show only 11 taxis were booked between January and March , " the spokesman said .
The Labour Party at City Hall has demanded an " explanation for the discrepancies " in the mayor 's accounts .

Levels of ADHD have been rising US researchers have pinned down new differences in the brain chemistry of people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
They found ADHD patients lack key proteins which allow them to experience a sense of reward and motivation .
The Brookhaven National Laboratory study appears in the Journal of the American Medical Association .
It is hoped it could help in the design of new ways to combat the condition .
For far too long there has been an assumption that children with ADHD are deliberately wilful
Andrea Bilbow
ADDISS
Previous research looking at the brains of people with ADHD had uncovered differences in areas controlling attention and hyperactivity .
But this study suggests ADHD has a profound impact elsewhere in the brain too .
Researcher Dr Nora Volkow said : " These deficits in the brain 's reward system may help explain clinical symptoms of ADHD , including inattention and reduced motivation , as well as the propensity for complications such as drug abuse and obesity among ADHD patients . "
The researchers compared brain scans of 53 adult ADHD patients who had never received treatment with those from 44 people who did not have the condition .
All of the participants had been carefully screened to eliminate factors which could potentially skew the results .
Dopamine pathway Using a sophisticated form of scan called positron emission tomography ( PET ) , the researchers focused on how the participants ' brains handled the chemical dopamine , a key regulator of mood .
In particular they measured levels of two proteins - dopamine receptors and transporters - without which dopamine cannot function effectively to influence mood .
ADHD patients had lower levels of both proteins in two areas of the brain known as the nucleus accumbens and midbrain .
Both form part of the limbic system , responsible for the emotions , and sensations such as motivation and reward .
Patients with more pronounced ADHD symptoms had the lowest levels of the proteins in these areas .
It suggests that teachers need to make sure that school tasks are interesting and exciting , so that children with ADHD are motivated to remain interested
Professor Katya Rubia
Dr Volkow said the findings supported the use of stimulant medications to treat ADHD by raising dopamine levels .
The findings also support the theory that people with ADHD may be more prone to drug abuse and obesity because they are unconsciously attempting to compensate for a deficient reward system .
Andrea Bilbow , of the ADHD charity ADDISS , said the study might help convince people who argue that ADHD is more to do with bad parenting than any concrete medical difference .
She said : " The findings of this new research will go a long way to helping us understand the presentation of symptoms but more importantly it may give teachers more of an idea of what interventions should be used in the classroom in order to accommodate children with ADHD .
" For far too long there has been an assumption that children with ADHD are deliberately wilful which has led to mismanagement and ultimately permanent exclusions from school . "
Professor Katya Rubia , of London 's Institute of Psychiatry , said : " This study widens our horizons .
It shows that ADHD is not just about abnormalities in the attention systems of the brain , but also abnormalities in the motivation and emotion centres .
" It suggests that teachers need to make sure that school tasks are interesting and exciting , so that children with ADHD are motivated to remain interested . "

Today Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) claimed today that the public option will not pass the Senate because the public is not in favor of it .
Lieberman said the public option is off the table because the Senate ca n’t get 60 votes for it .
He also went on MSNBC and said , “ Yes , I mean a government - run health insurance plan .
The public does n’t support it . ”
Here is the video courtesy of Think Progress :

Lieberman made the claim that the public option is not attainable , “ The question is , are people going to continue to fight for elements that are not attainable or are they going to try to find common ground ? ”
Host Andrea Mitchell asked him if he was referring to the public option .
Lieberman replied , “ I mean — yes , I mean a government - run health insurance plan .
The public does n’t support it .
They know that , ultimately , taxpayers will pay for it .
They do n’t want us to add to the debt .
They feel that the existing system , private insurance , Medicare , Medicaid , does pretty well . ”
Lieberman is lying .
A new Survey USA poll released on Thursday found that 77 % of Americans support having the choice of a public option .
A majority of people in the conservative state of Kentucky favor a public option .
A New York Times poll showed 72 % support for the public option , and an NBC News / Wall Street Journal poll showed support at 69 % .
As you can see from all of the polls listed above , public support is definitely strongly in favor of a public option .
The problem is that the health insurance industry is not in favor of a public option , and they spending millions of dollars to convince members of the Senate to drop the public option .
Lieberman was correct when he said that there are n’t 60 votes for the public option , but he was not telling the truth when said that the public does not support the public option .

Manufacturers of heavy - duty diesel engines have slashed emissions from new engines by more than 90 percent for most pollutants , according to a study released yesterday .
New pollution control technologies that were developed in response to U.S. EPA regulations have led to the steep declines in pollution , according to the study [ pdf ] .
For several major pollutants , emissions were reduced even more steeply than federal law required .
" The important message is to see how clean these diesel engines are , " said Joe Suchecki , a spokesman for the Engine Manufacturers Association .
The technologies that have been developed " are just working tremendously well , and they 're very effective in reducing the [ particulate matter ] and all the hydrocarbons and the air toxics to near zero levels , " he said .
The report is the first phase of a five - year study directed by the Health Effects Institute and conducted by the Coordinating Research Council .
The study was sponsored by a range of groups , including the Energy Department , EPA , the Engine Manufacturers Association and the American Petroleum Institute .
EPA 's 2001 highway diesel rule required manufacturers to steeply cut engine emissions of soot - and smog - forming pollutants for engines sold after January 2007 .
The rules apply to heavy - duty highway engines , such as those used in trucks and buses .
Researchers found that emissions of fine particulate matter , or soot , were about 99 percent lower than soot emissions allowed from engines manufactured in 2004 .
Soot emissions were also 90 percent lower than the new 2007 standard requires .
Pollution from carbon monoxide , hydrocarbons and a number of air toxics had also declined by more than 90 percent since 2004 levels and was significantly lower than required levels , the report says .
" The manufacturers outdid themselves in over - complying with the standards for carbon monoxide , hydrocarbons and particulate matter , " said Dan Greenbaum , president of the Health Effects Institute , an independent research organization funded jointly by EPA and industry .
NOx emissions were about 70 percent lower than past levels and 10 percent below the EPA requirement .
Manufacturers will be required to slash NOx output by another 80 percent for engines sold after Jan. 1 , 2010 .
" Obviously we have work to do on the NOx standard , which is coming up at the end of this year , and engine manufacturers are in the process of getting that technology developed and available , " Suchecki said .

Well I thought this was a good idea ; it 's conceptually humorous , but it 's been done .
I never saw it done with my level of quality though .

“ In Iraq , they ’d hit you and run , ” he said .
“ But these guys stick around and maneuver on you . ”
They also have a keen sense of when to fight and when the odds against them are too great .
Three weeks ago , the American military mounted a 4,000 - man Marine offensive in Helmand  the largest since President Obama ’s troop increase  and so far in many places , American commanders say , they have encountered less resistance than expected .
Yet it is also clear to many Marines and villagers here that Taliban fighters made a calculated decision : to retreat and regroup to fight where and when they choose .
And in the view of troops here who fought intensely in the weeks before the offensive began , fierce battles probably lie ahead if they are to clear the Taliban from sanctuaries so far untouched .
“ It was straight luck that we did n’t have a lot more guys hit , ” said Sgt. Brandon Tritle , another squad leader in Company C , who cited the Taliban ’s skill at laying down a base of fire to mount an attack .
“ One force will put enough fire down so you have to keep your heads down , then another force will maneuver around to your side to try to kill you , ” he said .
“ That ’s the same thing we do . ”

At the edges of Kenya 's Lake Nakuru , Paul Opiyo picks up a dead flamingo and warns some eager tourists not to touch it , just in case .
He points down to his feet - the brown earth is speckled with brittle white feather shafts .
" We should be underwater , standing here , " says the deputy warden of Lake Nakuru national park .
" This is n't the lake shore .
This is the lake floor . "
The disappearing lake
To reach the water 's edge , we have driven hundreds of metres out across the former lake bed - now a barren moonscape of tyre tracks and bones .
The pelicans and the flamingos are surviving on treated sewage
Paul Opiyo , Deputy warden , Lake Nakuru
In pictures : Mau forest " Twenty years ago , this lake was 2.6 metres deep , " says Mr Opiyo , of the Kenya Wildlife Service ( KWS ) .
" Last month , it was 1.4 metres .
" One point four metres , " he says again .
" It is a lake you can literally walk across . "
Lake Nakuru is disappearing .
And with it , around 1.5 million flamingoes - the icon of the Rift Valley - are under threat .
The pink ribbon round the lakeshore is a marvel which attracts 1,000 people a day to Nakuru , the most visited of all Kenya 's national parks .
" They come to be baptised in the birdwatchers ' paradise , " says Mr Opiyo .
" We have marabou stork , pelicans , yellow billed stork , Egyptian geese ... "
Trouble in paradise
But this year , there is not enough water to be " baptised " in .
All three of the rivers that feed Nakuru are bone dry .
The rivers flow from Mau forest .
We climb down into a dusty brown ditch - the remains of the Njoro , the main river flowing into Lake Nakuru .
The River Njoro - in the rainy season
This is the rainy season - the water should be over our heads .
But the measuring gauges are redundant .
" This used to be a permanent river - even in the dry season there was always some water flowing , " says Bernard Kuloba , a KWS ecologist .
" Now it 's becoming a seasonal river .
And the dry period is increasing .
" One reason is climate change .
But the other is land use change - upstream in Mau forest .
If Lake Nakuru dies , many smaller parks in Kenya will be at great risk
Paul Udoto , Kenya Wildlife Service " Settlement and agriculture have increased .
The water entering at the top does not reach the bottom . "
Down at the lakeside , the animals are thirsty - and not only the flamingoes .
The park is home to black rhino , water buffalo , hippos and tree - climbing lions .
All these animals need fresh river water for drinking because the lake itself is saline - like many in Rift Valley .
With the rivers empty , the marabou storks are now drinking instead from a stagnant pool of greasy grey gloop .
" This is sewage from the nearby town , " says Mr Opiyo .
" The smell is a sign that it was not completely treated .
" The pelicans , the flamingoes ... this is what they have to survive on - treated sewage . "
Desperate strategy
To keep the wildlife alive , the Kenya Wildlife Service has adopted a slightly desperate strategy .
Each month , they use 12,000 litres of diesel and spend 100,000 shillings pumping water from deep underground boreholes into drinking troughs .
These boreholes are sustaining the animals - so far .
Already , one of the boreholes we dug in the park is dry
Bernard Kuloba , Ecologist , Kenya Wildlife Service
But the trouble , says Mr Kuloba , is that the underground reservoir is fast drying up .
The water in the aquifer is not being replenished because of the damage to the forest ecosystem .
" Already , one of the boreholes we dug in the park is dry - we are not able to pump , " says the ecologist .
" The aquifer is low .
If we had a consistent drought , it would dry out . "
He points to a pile of bones - the remains of a buffalo that has desiccated in the heat .
" It came here to drink and then it died .
If the droughts continue , this will become an annual ritual . "
The Kenya Wildlife Service knows the park cannot depend on boreholes forever .
The boreholes dug in the park were not enough to save this buffalo
In the neighbouring towns of Nakuru and Njoro , hundreds of thousands of people are also suffering from water shortages .
To compensate , they rely on boreholes - which drain from the same aquifer as the animals in the park .
" A situation is arising where humans and wildlife are competing .
And when that happens , people will switch off water for wildlife so we can get some for ourselves , " says Mr Kuloba .
" I see that happening very soon .
I see conflict coming .
The next thing we might see is vandalism of the park fences . "
Lake Nakuru is the flagship of Kenya 's 36 national parks and reserves .
Once the Mau recovers , you can be sure the rivers will flow
Paul Opiyo , Deputy warden , Lake Nakuru
The park took 513 million shillings ( $ 6.8 m ; £ 4 m ) in 2007 - money which is essential to keep the smaller parks alive .
" Parks like Sibiloi and Kakamega - the revenue from Nakuru is what keeps them afloat , " says Paul Udoto , a KWS spokesman .
" If Lake Nakuru dies , those parks will be at great risk " .
From the roan antelope in Ruma to the turtles at Malindi , one way or another , they all drink from Lake Nakuru .
Which is why the Kenya Wildlife Service has become a major player in the operation to restore the Mau forest ecosystem .
Their rangers patrol the park in search of illegal loggers - and they will oversee the removal of settlers .
" Once the Mau recovers , you can be sure the rivers will flow , " says Paul Opiyo .
" The sun will rise over Nakuru again " .
Lake Nakuru - slowly disappearing
Your comments on this story : I am in Kenya in Nakuru town .
The situation here is very bad .
I have never witnessed a drought like this one before .
People are destroying forests like never before and the government is just watching .
Who will help mau .
Mau is crying .
Michuki , Nakuru , kenya I spoke at a conference in Nakuru 4 years ago .
We walked on the dry lake bed then , but the worsening in the intervening years is shocking .
The final photo from the article is a recognisable vantage point from the scenic overlook and it shows dramatic receding since my last visit .
The Rev. Dr. Brad Miller , Des Moines , IA I went to Kenya in 2007 and was fortunate enough to visit Lake Nakuru ...
Nothing could prepare me for the sight of millions of Flamingoes lining the shore , from a distance it looked like a pink beach around the waters edge .
Kenya is a beautiful country , in my eyes - paradise .
Something needs to be done to help ...
We cannot allow this iconic landmark to disappear ...
It 's not just the wildfowl that rely on the lake but also some of the most amazing wildlife in the world not to mention the local populace .
I for one wish the Kenya Wildlife Service all the very best and all the help they need .
Should they wish to have my help , they only need to ask and i will be there like a shot !!!
JP , Birmingham I was born and brought up in Molo 37 years ago .
We always woke up to chilly drizzling mornings that would go on till 1 PM .
This is is now history .
The area is all dusty windy and with no water .
The forests we cut down in a frenzy that was the timber factories all over .
I think the problem will persist so long as companies continue personalising the forests .
As it is now all the man made forests will mature at the same period and will end up being harvested at the same time hence another major dry spell 20 years from now .
Thuo Kariuki , Molo town , Nakuru district I have been an active member of the Boy Scouts Mvt in Kenya , and 24 years ago , we went camping in the forest and it was amazing .
I came back to Kenya for holidays with my friends from Dubai , and was shocked when I enquired about the campsite , located near LAKE NAKURU and to my utter dismay , was informed that it no longer existed .
I went there and yes , I was met by people selling charcoal and villages all set up .
I weeped dearly for my beloved country .
Shame for the perpetrators of this regime .
sad but true , my dear , beloved country is sinking , slowly , BUT surely into a state of despair and disillusionment :-(
Muchui Maingi , Dubai , U.A.E
I remember very well the times when most rivers in kenya were flowing with clean water that was being put to domestic use .
But now the case is different what we are seeing is a bomb that is about to blow on our face due to our own actions .
For instance the Njoro river which i once had a chance of swimming in when i was a small boy while visiting my grandmother who lives in that area , prompts me to shed tears since what has been left of it a scary part that nobody ever thought of - a dry bed is all that is left for us to see .
i take this opportunity to urge my fellow Kenyans to join hands together and preserve our environment .
John Njoroge Ng'ang'a , Tehran , Iran I come from Kenya and i was also surprised the rivers around Bahati , Nakuru have dried up and Lake nakuru is soon going to dry up .
Imagine all those beautiful birds gone for ever ?
Moi and his cronies should be prosecuted for damaging our country and those people in mau should be resettled and the squatters kicked out .
We can afford to destroy nature and make millions of people suffer and our future children because of greed .

In flattening Forrest Griffin on Saturday , Anderson Silva needed only 3 minutes , 23 seconds to restore a reputation that was in considerable danger of collapsing .
In each of his past two fights -- against Thales Leites and Patrick Cote -- Silva delivered an interpretive dance of " The English Patient " when audiences were expecting " Rambo , " fighting conservatively and disinterested in pushing his opponents when they shut down mentally .
Had he done that a third time , in a fight town as rabid as Philadelphia , fire extinguishers probably would 've been involved .
Anderson Silva 's one - round devastation of Forrest Griffin restored The Spider 's rep as MMA 's best fighter .
Ed Mulholland for ESPN.com
Instead , he looked every bit the pound - for - pound king that employer Dana White insists he is .
Slipping Griffin's heavy ( and slow ) punches with ease , he countered beautifully , falling into a rhythm of evasion and attack that was like watching someone play an instrument .
Where many fights become tumbling piles of arms and legs , this was beautifully efficient , truncated violence .
It was clean .
Silva 's timing could n't have been better , literally or figuratively : Just weeks after losing Fedor Emelianenko to Strikeforce -- which White , in an apparent audition for Mad magazine , has dubbed " Strikefarce " -- the UFC could 've used some fresh evidence that they have the more active and talented all - time great in their fold .
And they got it .
His talent no longer debatable , discussion now turns to what you do with someone this good that satisfies both business sense and fan expectations .
The options :
1. Keep Silva at 185 pounds .
Talent exists that would satisfy his contractual obligations : Demian Maia , Yushin Okami , Yoshihiro Akiyama , Wanderlei Silva and Vitor Belfort .
The problem is that no one has really earned a title shot beyond Dan Henderson and possibly Nate Marquardt ( who fights Maia on Aug. 29 ) .
If Silva 's title defenses are now sinking into redundancy , it 's time to reconsider his place there .
2 . The road show : Random bouts that would attract money and crowds without making much contextual sense .
Chief among these is the idea of opposing Georges St. Pierre in a meeting between two " pound - for - pound " greats that would have the adverse side effect of sacrificing one to build on the legacy of the other .
3 . A permanent move to 205 pounds .
According to Yahoo's Dan Wetzel , it 's a proposal already under consideration by Silva , manager Ed Soares and White .
Considering that Silva is a large middleweight who retains his speed in the heavier class , it does n't appear to be at all unreasonable -- save for his disinterest in fighting friend and training partner Lyoto Machida .
Considering Machida holds the title , it 's a little like volunteering to climb Everest but insisting you 'll stop just short of the peak .
What 's the point ?
Whatever Silva does , it should be in the pursuit of something -- not some aimless , nomadic expedition through multiple weight classes , taking random fights whenever the UFC is in need of a one - off headliner .
If he agrees to compete at 205 pounds , then that should be at the cost of his middleweight title and with the understanding he might potentially earn the right to face Machida .
( Sadly , life gets a lot easier for everyone if Mauricio Rua happens to defeat Machida on Oct. 24 . )
Anderson Silva 's toughest challenge might be putting friendship aside to fight Lyoto Machida .
Jon Kopaloff / Getty Images
If he remains at 185 , it should be with the blueprint that he could conceivably air out the entire division -- not only Maia and Okami , but Cung Le and Gegard Mousasi , if those fighters become available .
There will probably be sporadic discussion of Silva facing heavyweights .
( He 's a solid 220 when not dieting down . )
That 's all it should be -- talk .
There might 've been some rational thinking in Silva facing a smaller heavyweight champion like Randy Couture , but expecting him to be competitive with the current era of comic - book - character heavyweights who have to cut to make 265 is a little sadistic .
There is value in Silva vacating his middleweight belt :
With three more fights on his contract , not owning a title would free him at its conclusion , at which point he 'd probably indulge in the desire to fight Roy Jones in boxing .
Those are all just fights , though .
There 's a lot you can do with the best fighter in the world : highlight - reel specials , sparring sessions with celebrities , tournament - style eliminations to decide his next contender and on and on .
Silva is the springboard for a lot of inventive business :
It 's up to the UFC to use its imagination .
As for the inevitable press sparring over its marquee athlete and Strikeforce 's : Backed by record pay - per - view subscribers and hours of basic cable television , White can anoint whomever he pleases with the " best ever " title , and it 's likely to be digested without complication by the masses .
( Emelianenko exists in a bit of a vacuum , at least until CBS enters the picture . )
Footage like the Griffin knockout makes it real easy .
There will never be an absolute answer as to who 's the better fighter , Emelianenko or Anderson Silva .
But the UFC 's machine guarantees that fewer and fewer people will even bother asking the question .

US Census Bureau report : 40 million living in poverty
By Kate Randall
30 September 2009
The overall poverty rate in the US rose to 13.2 percent in 2008 , as workers across all sectors of the economy became jobless and increasing numbers of families were forced into destitution , according to a new government report .
Real median household income also declined by 3.6 percent .
The report released Tuesday , part of the US Census Bureau ’s American Community Survey , is the most recent to measure the recession ’s impact on working class families and the poor .
Based on the changes between 2007 and 2008 , the first full year of the recession , its findings do not reflect increases in poverty and joblessness this year as the consequences of the crisis have become even more acute .
The official poverty rate of 13.2 percent in 2008 was up from 12.5 percent in 2007 .
This figure translates into 39.8 million people in poverty across America .
The official poverty level is set at $ 22,000 annually for a family of four with two children or $ 12,000 for an individual , an absurdly low threshold .
This means that far more people than indicated by the survey do not have adequate resources to pay for food , shelter , medical care and other basic necessities .
The poverty rate rose across virtually all demographic groups .
Poverty among Hispanics climbed from 21.5 percent in 2007 to 23.2 percent in 2008 .
Non-Hispanic whites saw poverty rise from 8.2 percent in 2007 to 8.6 percent in 2008 , while poverty among Asians was up from 10.2 percent in 2007 to 11.8 percent in 2008 .
African - Americans were the only group where poverty remained statistically unchanged at a staggering 24.7 percent , or about one in four people .
The Census Bureau reported a rise in poverty in 31 states and the District of Columbia .
Two of the four most populous states — California and Florida — saw poverty rates rise by 1 percent , to just over 13 percent in each state .
Connecticut saw the largest increase in poverty , rising to 9.3 percent , with an additional 1.4 percent of the state ’s population living in poverty .
Connecticut ’s proximity to Wall Street , the center of the financial collapse , contributed to the state ’s poverty as spending cuts by bankers and other financial employees in the New York City suburbs were reflected in declines in income for the lowest paid workers .
William Frey , a demographer at the Brookings Institution , commented in an interview , “ People do n’t go from being a CEO or a hedge fund manager into poverty , but there is a trickle - down effect when these groups of people start to cut back on their spending .
In many places , the first people to go when things get tight are the lowest - earning workers . ”
Michigan , which has been devastated by the collapse of the auto industry , is the only state that has seen poverty increase for two years in a row , with the rate now standing at 13 percent .
The industrial states of Pennsylvania and Indiana also saw significant increases in poverty , along with Oregon and Hawaii .
The South remained the most impoverished , at 14.3 percent , up slightly from 14.2 percent in 2007 .
Mississippi , with 21.2 percent in poverty , saw the highest rate of any state , while poverty in Kentucky , West Virginia and Arkansas hovered around 17 percent .
The Midwest poverty rate rose to 12.4 percent from 11.1 percent the previous year .
The West saw the largest increase in poverty , up by 1.5 percent , rising from 12 percent in 2007 to 13.5 percent .
The Northeast , which saw an increase in poverty in 2007 , saw the rate remain statistically unchanged , at 11.6 percent in 2008 .
The rate of poverty among America ’s children is alarming , with 19 percent — 14.1 million children — affected in 2008 , up a full percentage point from a year earlier .
This rate increased in 26 states and in Washington , DC .
Children in families headed by a single female suffered the highest rates of poverty : 43.5 percent of those under 18 years of age live in poverty , while 53.3 percent of children under 6 years are poor .
Increasing numbers of families , both the jobless and workers facing shrinking hours and paychecks , are turning to food pantries and the Food Stamp program .
Food Stamp use in 2008 jumped 13 percent to nearly 9.8 million US households , led by Louisiana , Maine and Kentucky .
Two cities — Pharr , Texas , and the former General Motors production center , Flint , Michigan — each had more than a third of their residents on food stamps .
Families with two or more workers accounted for 28.4 percent of food stamp recipients in 2008 , up 1.5 percent from 2007 .
Following three years of annual income increases , real median income declined in the US by 3.6 percent between 2007 and 2008 , falling from $ 52,163 to $ 50,303 .
The Midwest and South saw the biggest declines in median income , 4 percent and 4.9 percent respectively .
The gap between the richest and poorest Americans is also widening as the economic crisis ravages household budgets .
An Associated Press analysis of the Census Bureau statistics shows that the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans , those making $ 138,000 or more a year , earned 11.4 times the $ 12,000 made by individuals living below the poverty line in 2008 .
In 2007 , the richest 10 percent made 11.2 times more .
The jump in poverty and income inequality comes as the job market continues to shrink , even as government and economic analysts speak of a turnaround .
According to US Labor Department figures from July , job seekers now outnumber openings six to one , with only 2.4 million full - time , permanent jobs open while 14.5 million people are officially unemployed and looking for work .
Many companies remain cautious about hiring new workers in the uncertain economic environment .
Having trimmed back workers ’ hours and laid off temporary workers , even if businesses do expand in the future they are likely to increase output by increasing the workload on existing employees .
Heidi Shierholz , an economist at the Economic Policy Institute , told the New York Times , “ They have tons of room to increase work without hiring a single person .
For people who are out of work , we do not see signs of light at the end of the tunnel . ”
From December 2007 through July 2009 , job openings have declined in every area of the country : 45 percent in the West and South , 36 percent in the Midwest , and 23 percent in the Northeast .
According to the Times , since the end of 2008 virtually every sector of the economy has been hit by the collapse in job openings , which have shrunk 47 percent in manufacturing , 37 percent in construction , 22 percent in retail , and 21 percent in education and health services .
While it is estimated that the government could spend in excess of $ 23 trillion to bail out the banks , and hundreds of billions to pursue its military conquests in Iraq and Afghanistan , nothing of any substance is being done to help the millions of Americans being plunged into joblessness and poverty .
The National Employment Law Project , an advocacy group , estimates that 400,000 Americans nationwide could exhaust their unemployment benefits by the end of September and 1.4 million long - term unemployed could stop receiving checks by the end of the year .
In some states , such as California , where the unemployment rate hit 12.2 percent in July — the highest level since 1940 — workers laid off early in the recession have received three extensions on the regular 26 weeks of benefits , bringing them to a maximum of 79 weeks of payments .
The US House recently passed a $ 1.4 billion bill to provide another 13 weeks of jobless benefits in high unemployment states like California .
The legislation still faces a vote in the Senate .
The extension in benefits , however , would not cover many of the newly unemployed , or those yet to lose their jobs .
In California , for instance , hundreds of thousands who filed claims after June 14 of this year would be eligible for no more than 39 weeks of benefits .
A House bill that would have provided longer extensions through 2010 was scrapped because it would have cost $ 70 billion , a price tag the lawmakers were unwilling to authorize .

Advertisement A US soldier has been captured by militants in eastern Afghanistan , the US military has said .
The soldier is believed to be the first seized in either Iraq or Afghanistan for at least two years .
News of the capture came as US and Afghan forces began a major operation against Taliban forces in southern Helmand province .
One of the two latest British deaths was that of the highest - ranking Army officer to be killed since 1982 .
The US military says the aim of the offensive is to provide security ahead of presidential elections this August .
Map : Helmand river valley region Helmand has seen the worst violence anywhere in Afghanistan , and military commanders say they need to break what they call the stalemate in the south of the country , says the BBC's Martin Patience in the Afghan capital , Kabul .
The captured soldier was not involved in the operation , codenamed Khanjar , or Strike of the Sword .
A hardline Taliban faction called Haqqani said it had the soldier , but this has not been confirmed by the main Taliban spokesman .
The army was using all its resources to find the missing serviceman , who was taken on Tuesday , spokeswoman Capt Elizabeth Mathias said .
AFP news agency said a commander of Haqqani , named only as Bahram , said the soldier was captured along with three Afghans in the Yousuf Khail district of Paktika province .
The commander said the soldier had been taken to " a safe place " .
Another Haqqani commander , Mullah Sangeen , told Reuters the soldier would be held until Taliban fighters detained by the US were released .
Caroline Wyatt
BBC defence correspondent
The US marines say the operation will be decisive and is intended to seize almost the entire lower Helmand River valley , which remains the heartland of the Taliban insurgency in Helmand and a major area for the production of opium , which helps fund the insurgency .
US commanders hope this offensive will help turn the tide in the current stalemate against the Taliban .
The aim of this major operation is to " clear , hold and build " in areas under Taliban influence ahead of Afghan presidential elections this August .
The hope is also that if US and other Nato forces are seen as clearly winning the military battle against the insurgents , middle and lower - ranking Taliban leaders and fighters are more likely to defect back to the Afghan government 's side , with US and UK sources in Kabul convinced that the US troop surge is already unsettling the Taliban leadership .
Operation hits Taliban heartland
The BBC 's security correspondent Frank Gardner says the circumstances of this capture are strange and potentially very embarrassing for the Pentagon .
The Taliban are claiming he was drunk when they caught him , he says .
There is no indication he became separated during a firefight - rather that he wandered off out of his base with the three Afghans , our correspondent adds .
' Massive force '
The US military says about 4,000 marines as well as 650 Afghan troops - supported by Nato planes - are involved in the Helmand operation .
Marines spokesman Brig Gen Larry Nicholson said the operation was different from previous ones because of the " massive size of the force " and its speed .
A Taliban spokesman said the group would resist in various ways and that there would be no permanent US victory .
New strategy
It is the first such large - scale operation since US President Barack Obama authorised the deployment of 21,000 extra US troops to Afghanistan , as part of a new strategy for winning the conflict .
Many of those troops are being redeployed from operations in Iraq .
The operation began when units moved into the Helmand River valley in the early hours of Thursday .
Lt Col Thorneloe was ' an outstanding commanding officer '
Helicopters and heavy transport vehicles carried out the advance , with Nato planes providing air cover .
Our correspondent in Kabul says the idea is that they will move into towns and villages which are under Taliban control .
With the fresh US deployments , military commanders say they are confident that they will make " significant " gains this summer , even if , as our correspondent says , a decisive victory is unlikely .
Air operations UK - led forces in Helmand launched their own operation to combat the Taliban insurgency last week , in what the UK's Ministry of Defence described as one of the largest air operations in modern times .
At the leading edge of his generation , his loss will be felt deeply not only by his family but also by his soldiers and others , who like me , had the privilege to serve with him
Sir Richard Dannatt
Chief of the General Staff
UK Lt Colonel dies in Afghanistan Thousands of British forces under Nato command have been fighting the Taliban in Helmand since 2006 , but there has been criticism that they have been overstretched and under - resourced .
One of two British soldiers killed in an explosion in Helmand province on Wednesday was the highest - ranking Army officer to die since the Falklands war of 1982 , the Ministry of Defence said .
He was named at Lt Col Rupert Thorneloe , 39 , the commanding officer of the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards .
Trooper Joshua Hammond , 18 , also died , and six others injured .
General Sir Richard Dannatt , Chief of the General Staff , said Lt Col Thornloe was " an outstanding commanding officer " and his death was a " devastating blow " .
He added : " At the leading edge of his generation , his loss will be felt deeply not only by his family but also by his soldiers and others , who like me , had the privilege to serve with him . "
The two men were killed when a roadside bomb exploded under their Viking armoured vehicle .
Lt Col Thornloe had joined a supply convoy to see his men deployed on operation Panther 's Claw , to oust the Taliban from the area around Lashkar Gah .
The BBC 's defence correspondent Caroline Wyatt says questions will be asked about why such a high - ranking officer was travelling a Viking vehicle .
They are supposed to be restricted to lower - risk areas , and are due to be replaced in Afghanistan next year by the more heavily armoured ' Warthog ' vehicle .
OPERATION 'KHANJAR '
About 4,000 US and 650 Afghan troops deployed to Helmand river valley
Initial operations focused on villages of Nawa and Garmsir near the provincial capital Lashkar Gah
British operation recently recaptured the village of Babaji from the Taliban to the north of the region

Hemp is one of the fastest growing biomasses in existence , uses less water than cotton , and requires minimal pesticides to thrive .
Yet it is still illegal to grow under U.S. federal law due to its relation to marijuana .
That has n’t stopped hemp fiber from making headway into the mainstream consciousness , and now even Hanesbrands–one of the world ’s largest consumer apparel brands–is getting in on the action .
Portland , Oregon - based Naturally Advanced Technologies has proven that Crailar Fabric Technology can turn the normally rough hemp into a material that is as soft as cotton .
Hanesbrands likes the idea so much that it is allowing Naturally Advanced Technologies to retrofit its dyeing equipment with the company ’s technology to test if hemp fabric can be used in regular production .
Naturally Advanced Technologies ’ process has a big advantage over organic cotton : cost .
Crailer Fabric shrinks less during production than cotton , so then final cost is close to that of regular , non-organic cotton .
So Hanes gets the advantage of a cost - efficient process along with the environmental credibility that comes with using hemp products .
If all goes as planned , the traditional Hanes cotton t- shirt could be replaced with the Hanes hemp t- shirt .
Once that happens , it will be hard to justify laws of any sort against hemp production .
And who knows ?
Maybe one day we ’ll even live in hemp houses .

ubuntu |oǒ' boǒntoō|
Ubuntu is an ancient African word meaning ‘ humanity to others ’ .
It is often described as reminding us that ‘ I am what I am because of who we all are ’ .
We bring the spirit of Ubuntu to the world of computers and software .
The Ubuntu distribution represents the best of what the world ’s software community has shared with the world .
Where did it all begin ?
Linux was already established in 2004 , but it was fragmented into proprietary and unsupported community editions , and free software was not a part of everyday life for most computer users .
That ’s when Mark Shuttleworth gathered a small team of Debian developers who together founded Canonical and set out to create an easy - to - use Linux desktop called Ubuntu .
The mission for Ubuntu is both social and economic .
First , we deliver the world ’s free software , freely , to everybody on the same terms .
Whether you are a student in India or a global bank , you can download and use Ubuntu free of charge .
Second , we aim to cut the cost of professional services - support , management , maintenance , operations - for people who use Ubuntu at scale , through a portfolio of services provided by Canonical which ultimately fund the improvement of the platform .
Ubuntu releases
Ubuntu was the first operating system to commit to scheduled releases on a predictable cadence , every six months , starting in October 2004 .
In 2006 we decided that every fourth release , made every two years , would receive long - term support for large - scale deployments .
This is the origin of the term LTS for stable , maintained releases .
The Swiss government , vowing to protect its vaunted bank secrecy laws , said on Wednesday that it was prepared to seize UBS client data rather than allow the bank to hand it over to the United States to settle a tax case .
The dispute , which is playing out in federal court in a Miami , has become a test of Washington ’s efforts to pierce Swiss banking laws as it tries to crack down on wealthy Americans who avoid taxes by hiding money in secret offshore accounts .
The Justice Department sued the Swiss banking giant UBS in February , saying it suspected the bank of helping Americans hide billions of dollars .
But so far UBS has refused a demand that it turn over the names of 52,000 American clients , arguing that to do so would be illegal under Swiss banking secrecy laws and would open it to prosecution at home .
A hearing has been scheduled next week in Federal District Court in Miami .
Swiss authorities , in a court filing Wednesday , said that they would not allow UBS to turn over the names .
Tarot - A Brief Overview
Tarot is sometimes also referred to as tarock or tarocchi .
Tarot is basically a set of 78 different cards .
These cards include four suits of fourteen cards each , one Fool , and twenty - one trump cards .
Each set of 14 cards includes 10 pip and 4 face cards .
Tarot cards are popularly used in various European tarot card games , such as French Tarot and Italian Tarocchini .
However , in the English speaking countries , these cards are basically used for divinity purposes .
In this case , the cards are classified into two groups - 56 minor arcana ( the pip and four face cards ) and 22 major arcana ( trump cards and one fool card ) .
The 56 cards of the Minor Arcana consist of four groups or suits , including Cups , Wands , Pentacles , and Swords .
Each suit represents a theme .
For example , Wands represent the theme for activity , ambition , and jobs .
Coins represent the material aspects of life , such as finance and security .
Cups or Pentacles focus on relationships and emotions .
And , the Sword reflects matters of moral and conflict issues .
Tarot Spreads
In order to perform a tarot reading , the cards are first shuffled and then spread on the desk in a specific pattern , this process is referred to as Tarot Spread .
The reader or the subject then randomly chooses a couple of cards one by one .
Sometimes , a specific number is assigned to each position in the spread and the cards are chosen in that sequence .
But , only one card is chosen at a time .
Once that card is interpreted , the reader then moves on and chooses another card .
However , some tarot card readers do not choose the cards randomly .
Instead , they intentionally choose the very first card in the spread .
This card is referred to as significator .
Different tarot card readers use different patterns for spreads , such as The Mirror Spread , Star Spread , Tetractys , 1 - card spread , astrological spread , 3 - card spread , Horse - Show spread , and Celtic Cross .
Tarot Decks
There are hundreds of choices available in Tarot Decks .
Some are based upon mythology , legends , famous artwork , books , and even movies .
There is no specific formula to choose the right deck .
You can choose the one that feels right for you .
If you are still not sure , the best bet is to choose the Rider Waite deck .
How Do The Cards Work ?
Tarot card reading is an intuitive process .
The concept is based on a belief that every card holds a specific meaning - something that can be interpreted in a way to gain insight into events occurring in the life of the person ( subject ) .
Based on the interpretation , the Tarot reader predicts about the current and the future situations of the person .
Most readers also believe that there is a Spiritual force ( such as Gaia ) that guides these cards .
However , some modern readers do not believe in such things .
They rather try to give the entire process a scientific look by saying that the cards actually help them tap into the subconscious and unconscious mind of the subject .
The Tarot card readers take great care in interpreting what they see in the cards .
The good ones will try to keep things positive even if the card is indicating gloom , doom , and destruction .
Instead of creating a situation of panic for the subject , they would rather say things can change at any time in his / her life and that he / she must be very careful .
Based on some of the employers ' comments in the article , there seems to be a widespread belief that a tarnished credit report necessarily results from " bad decision making " and that it is evidence that an employee is " unreliable , unwise or too susceptible to temptation to steal . "
Last week , the NYT ran a piece describing how common it has become for employers to use the credit report as a screen device for job applicants ( " Another Hurdle for the Jobless : Credit Inquiries " ) .
In a nutshell , if your credit report shows too much debt , a bankruptcy , or a low credit score , employers do n't want you .
Where the heck is the evidence for these assumptions ?
Just because someone has a low credit score or has filed for bankruptcy does not make him or her a shady untrustworthy character .
It 's much more likely that the person has experienced a job loss , medical expenses , break up of a family , over - the - top credit card fees and interest , or an attempt to avoid home foreclosure .
A quick read of the bankruptcy literature will show that .
A couple years ago ( 2007 ) , I published an article in Journal of Poverty using the CBP data describing the ways in which a bankruptcy on the credit report undermines the fresh start ( " Personal Bankruptcy and the Credit Report : Conflicting Mechanisms of Social Mobility " ) .
Over half of the respondents reported that they had been denied housing , transportation , credit , or employment explicitly because of the bankruptcy on their credit report .
Respondents were denied jobs in accounting , mortgage lending , and even the moving and packing industry .
Others were fired when their employers learned of the bankruptcy : one worked for the Traffic Safety Administration , one as a construction worker , and another as a clerk .
I know that some people are arguing that if the job is not tied to money and finances , the information in the credit report should not be used in hiring decisions .
For example , in Hawaii , it is now apparently illegal to pull the credit report until after the job offer has been made , and then the credit check has to be directly related to the job qualifications .
I would push further -- even if the job has to do with money , the credit report should have no bearing .
The fact is , just because someone 's credit report is blemished does not mean they can't handle or be trusted with money .
Consider the folks on Wall Street or people in the mortgage lending industry or even bank tellers and lenders at your local bank who , because of the shrinking economy , have lost their jobs -- and then probably fallen behind on their bills , thus damaging their credit report .
How much sense does it make to deny them jobs in the financial world ?
Not much .
I want to share one CBP interview that I will never forget -- and which illustrates my point beautifully .
The guy had been in college earning a B.A. in accounting when he and his wife divorced .
He got the kids , who were quite young at the time .
He worked part time , but of course , there were no medical benefits .
His son had some stomach issues and he had to go to the emergency room a couple times .
The result was large medical bills that Dad could not repay .
Eventually , because of the mounting medical debts , he filed for bankruptcy .
Fast forward to college graduation .
He 's on the job market as an accountant .
He lands several interviews with good firms -- and the initial interviews go very well .
Before the second interviews , all request his permission to pull a credit report .
Of course , he agrees .
Once they learn of the bankruptcy , he 's dropped like a hot potato -- no more interest in hiring him .
One of the HR folks actually told him that given his bankruptcy , they did n't feel that he could be trusted .
Baloney .
This guy was working hard to pull himself up by his all - American bootstraps and instead he got slapped down .
I 'm going to have to side with Representative Jon Switalski from Michigan on this one : Using the credit report as a screening device in hiring decisions is discrimination and is a practice that should be illegal .
Moreover , from the point of the employer , it simply is n't a wise business practice -- many smart and qualified folks are going to be overlooked just because of the economic downturn or someone in their family had the misfortune of getting ill .
Whether you 're searching for a storefront in a strange neighborhood or drunks passed out on the curb , Google Street View can be an extremely helpful tool .
Street View has drawn its share of critics , however , and we can now add the government of Switzerland to that list .
Just days after launching Street View in Portugal , Switzerland , and Taiwan , the search giant has been told by the Swiss Government that it needs to yank the Street View from its Swiss maps , a development that has left the search giant " surprised . "
Hanspeter Th�r , the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner ( FDPIC ) , has accused Google of not having taken the necessary steps to safeguard the privacy of Swiss citizens .
Th�r has demanded that " Google Inc. immediately withdraw its online service Google Street View concerning Switzerland , " according to a statement .
In the months leading up to its launch , Street View had been a concern in Switzerland .
Th�r 's office has an informational page ( in German and French ) on its site devoted to the service .
It includes instructions on how to get your face blurred if you show up in a snapshot of a street and says that Google would be allowed to offer Street View for Swiss streets only if " negotiated conditions " be met .
The FDPIC has left itself a big out , however , saying that should the anonymization process have shortcomings and a number of faces are visible , the Commissioner can take " necessary measures " — like banning the service .
The anonymity issue is one that Google has had to frequently negotiate since launching the service .
In May 2008 , the European Union reminded Google that it needed to respect local privacy laws .
A Japanese privacy group has also been critical of Street View , arguing that it " constitutes violent infringement on citizens ' privacy " by taking and publishing pictures online without express permission .
The service has even been the subject of litigation in the US , with a federal judge tossing out an invasion - of - privacy lawsuit filed last year .
So far , Google has been amenable to government requests for changes in how Street View operates .
In Japan , the company is replacing all of the original snapshots to address privacy concerns .
And , as the Swiss FDPIC notes , Google offers the ability for those pictured in Street View to have their faces blurred .
Even the poor kid caught falling off his bike by Google 's cameras caught a break , as those images have been replaced .
A Google spokesperson told Ars that the company has received very few requests for image removal or face - blurring since launching Google Maps in Switzerland .
" We were surprised by the DPA 's announcement , " the spokesperson said .
" We have been engaged in constructive dialogue with the organization ahead of this week 's launch to demonstrate how we protect people 's privacy on StreetView .
And we 're ready to do so again or to answer any additional questions . "
Google promises that any anonymization and image removal requests will be responded to " within hours . "

Bank of England gives strong hint it may again expand its policy of flooding the economy with money
Expectations were growing in the City tonight that interest rates could remain at historically low levels for years after the Bank of England gave a strong hint that it might again expand its policy of flooding the economy with money .
Markets were taken by surprise today when minutes of the latest meeting of the Bank 's monetary policy committee showed that the governor , Mervyn King , had wanted to pump an extra £ 75 bn into the financial system but was outvoted .
Gerard Lyons , chief economist at Standard Chartered Bank , said it was now possible that King would not raise interest rates from their current all - time low of 0.5 % during his current term as governor , which lasts until mid-2013 .
" The Bank should be congratulated on their practical response to this crisis .
There is no way that the Bank of England is going to prematurely tighten policy , " he said .
Other economists said that because whichever party winning next year 's election would have to cut spending and raise taxes to close the enormous budget deficit , the resulting fiscal squeeze would mean interest rates would probably be kept very low to keep the economy moving .
King , along with external members Tim Besley and David Miles , voted to raise the Bank 's policy of quantitative easing by £ 75bn to £ 200bn in an attempt to ensure that economic recovery takes hold .
The other six members , though , were only prepared to sanction a rise of £ 50bn .
The vote marks only the third time since he became governor in 2003 that King has been outvoted and the first time that none of the Bank 's internal MPC members have voted with their boss .
The pound fell sharply as traders digested the news that King was more gloomy about the economy than previously thought - despite his warnings last week that any recovery could be " slow and protracted " .
Sterling had recovered some of its losses by the close , however , to trade around $ 1.65 and € 1.16 .
The Liberal Democrat economics spokesman , Vince Cable , said : " It is clear that several members of the MPC still believe the greatest danger the country faces is a prolonged recession and deflation .
These minutes further underline the massive uncertainty the economy faces . "
George Osborne , the shadow chancellor , said : " While we all hope that the formal end of the recession is approaching , it is clear from these minutes that the recovery will be long and difficult and the debt problems are huge . "
King has been growing increasingly concerned that with the banking sector still in trouble , households carrying enormous debts and unemployment rising strongly , Britain risks the kind of " lost decade " of deflation that Japan suffered in the 1990s rather than a return to high inflation .
The minutes made clear that the MPC thought the risks of doing too little quantitative easing were greater than those of doing too much .
" The potential adverse consequences of adding another large monetary stimulus might be less severe than the possible costs of acting too cautiously ... if it became apparent that monetary policy had been overly expansive , policy could be tightened by a combination of asset sales and increases in bank rate , " said the minutes .
Danny Gabay , director of Fathom Financial Consulting , said : " Put another way , Japan is more likely than Zimbabwe .
And we would completely agree with that assessment .
" Until the MPC can convincingly point to progress in unblocking bank lending to the wider economy , we would suggest that investors continue to expect the MPC to err on the side of more rather than less quantitative easing . "
The minutes also made clear that while it was too early to fully assess whether quantitative easing was working , the MPC was disappointed that growth in the money supply had been lower than it had hoped .
The other six members of the MPC preferred a more modest increase in quantitative easing because they felt the immediate risks to the economy appeared to have receded and that too much could cause " unwelcome " rises in some asset prices .
In writing four books and an unknown quantity of articles and blog posts , I ’ve discovered the simple secret to maintaining quality .
I share it with you here in mnemonic nursery rhyme fashion :
Write when inspired ; rest when tired .
Whether the task is writing , design , or hanging a picture straight , it is obvious that we do our best work when healthy , rested , refreshed , alert , and eager to do the job for its own sake .
But anyone who has done professional work also knows that we must often work late into the night at the behest of deadlines .
There are jobs that call for us to push ourselves , not merely creatively ( which is exhilarating ) , but physically — even when our bodies need rest , our minds are dimmed , our concentration dented , and our inspiration nonexistent .
Therein lies our conflict , and one key to the difference between good and great .
Design is a hurting thing
Work is work , and we must do what we must do .
But when quality matters most , the old saw about “ good or fast — choose one , ” holds true .
Pushing through to the finish line when you have nothing left inside you is great for marathon runners , but not so hot for creative professionals .
In particular , if you ’re trying to write clearly and well , it ’s better to let a deadline slide by a day than to “ just finish up . ”
I call out writing in particular because if you push out a design when you ’re exhausted , the details and balance will suffer , and it wo n’t be as great as it can be — but the public has such a low expectation of aesthetics in web design that you might get away with it .
Only you and a few of your designer friends will recognize the sloppy , ill - considered bits that make your work good when it could have been great .
Of course , your designer friends will think less of you , and you ’ll cringe every time you see the site , but if you do n’t have a taste for masochism , you should n’t be in design , because the hurt will kill you .
Night of the living deadlines
There ’s a reason they call them deadlines .
With design that could have been great but was ever so slightly bungled due to exhaustion in the face of ridiculous deadlines , it is only the designer and the rare armchair aesthetician who know .
But when writers push themselves to make a deadline , everyone knows , because the passages where they cheated are unclear , unpersuasive , ineffective .
A reader need n’t follow the exact art and subtle science of kerning or vertical grid building to recognize when a sentence is n’t clear , or fails to make a convincing point , or does n’t seem to entirely belong with its older and younger brother sentences .
When I let a publisher ’s deadline push out a piece of writing before it is ready , it is like thrusting a helpless preemie into the cruel world .
And it ’s not just external deadlines that can wreck my work .
Say I ’m writing here , where there are no deadlines .
I get nearly to the end of what I want to say , and then I ’m called away by work or family .
When I return to the blog post hours later to wrap things up and publish , I ’m distracted , and the powerful emotion and single idea that initially led me me to write has flown over the garden wall .
If I just bang out a finish , the whole piece will be weakened .
I know because I ’ve done it .
Will no one think of the readers ?
Currently I ’m working on the third edition of Designing With Web Standards , and in addition to mentally approaching it as a new book in order to truly rethink and reinvigorate it , I ’m also sticking like epoxy to the discipline of holding back chapters until they are ready .
This sounds like what a writer would always do , but trade publishing is like a slave galley in a Roman galleon — if the sufferer beside you collapses under the whip , you need to row harder .
You wo n’t get that placement at Borders if you do n’t finish on time .
Amazon wo n’t give you that special promotional push if you do n’t turn it in six weeks earlier than your contract says you must , &c .
Never mind the bollocks .
You are not writing for Amazon , or to fit a staff proofreader ’s vacation schedule , as important and real as those considerations may be .
You are writing for readers , a duty as sacred , in its way , as parenting .
If you do n’t believe the previous sentence , if you think writing is mainly about getting paid , I ’m sorry you wasted your time reading this page , and I hope you find another way to earn a living soon .
The world is already choking on half - considered , squeezed - out shit .
There ’s no need to add to the pile .
If you want to be great , or at least to be better , start by breathing , taking breaks , and working intensely when the mood is on .

What is the moral foundation of your economic beliefs ?
Do economic beliefs even require a moral foundation ?

Do you think wealth can only be created off the backs of the poor ?
Is there a fixed amount of wealth in the world for all to share ?
If so , where did it come from and how has mankind been getting richer for the past 200 years ?

Where does this claim come from ?
Are claims limited to people living in the same country or do they extend to all humanity ?
Why ?
Is it the job of government to mediate these claims ?
If you believe highly progressive taxation and expansive government entitlements are necessary to reduce economic inequality , does it matter to you if the attendant incentives and disincentives reduce the total amount of wealth available to be shared ?
Is making all people equally poor an acceptable solution to inequality ?
Are you careful not to judge people by the color of their skin yet sometimes quick to make judgments based on economic status ?
If so , do you make distinctions based solely on wealth or lack thereof or does it make a difference to you how an individual became rich or poor ?

Do you believe the accused have a right to remain silent ?
How would you feel if the government compelled a vast network of informers to file reports on the behavior of citizens whether or not they 've been accused of a crime ?
OK then , what is the moral principle that allows you to make exceptions to these beliefs when it comes to a person 's income and investments ?
When you see corruption between business and politicians , are you inclined to shrug and accept it as the nature of man ?
If corruption touches your own business are you impelled to speak out , do you tolerate it in silence while sticking to your principles , or do you seek your share of the spoils because everyone else is doing it ?
Do you resent being asked to justify your economic beliefs or the moral foundation they rest on ?
Do your ends always justify your means ?
Do you feel entitled to having your beliefs respected solely because they are yours ?
Would you feel the same way about your mathematical beliefs ?
Are you comfortable holding contradictory beliefs ?
When was the last time you questioned them ?
What do you do when you discover you hold two beliefs that contradict each other ?
Are you happy to see the state to which we 've fallen - pressure group pitted against pressure group , old against young , citizen against citizen all fighting to grab a share of the swelling portion of our national income funneled through the hands of Congress ?
What other outcome would you expect when moral foundations crumble ?

Last year , bureaucrats at the VA 's National Center for Ethics in Health Care advocated a 52 - page end - of - life planning document , " Your Life , Your Choices . "
It was first published in 1997 and later promoted as the VA 's preferred living will throughout its vast network of hospitals and nursing homes .
After the Bush White House took a look at how this document was treating complex health and moral issues , the VA suspended its use .
Unfortunately , under President Obama , the VA has now resuscitated " Your Life , Your Choices . "
Who is the primary author of this workbook ?
Dr. Robert Pearlman , chief of ethics evaluation for the center , a man who in 1996 advocated for physician - assisted suicide in Vacco v. Quill before the U.S. Supreme Court and is known for his support of health - care rationing .
" Your Life , Your Choices " presents end - of - life choices in a way aimed at steering users toward predetermined conclusions , much like a political " push poll . "
For example , a worksheet on page 21 lists various scenarios and asks users to then decide whether their own life would be " not worth living . "
You would think that if Republicans wanted to totally mischaracterize a health care provision and demagogue it like nobody ’s business , they would at least pick something that the vast majority of them had n’t already voted for just a few years earlier .
Because that ’s not just shameless , it ’s stupid .
Yes , that ’s right .
Remember the 2003 Medicare prescription drug bill , the one that passed with the votes of 204 GOP House members and 42 GOP Senators ?
Anyone want to guess what it provided funding for ?
Did you say counseling for end - of - life issues and care ?
Ding ding ding !!
Let ’s go to the bill text , shall we ?
“ The covered services are : evaluating the beneficiary ’s need for pain and symptom management , including the individual ’s need for hospice care ; counseling the beneficiary with respect to end - of - life issues and care options , and advising the beneficiary regarding advanced care planning . ”
The only difference between the 2003 provision and the infamous Section 1233 that threatens the very future and moral sanctity of the Republic is that the first applied only to terminally ill patients .
Section 1233 would expand funding so that people could voluntarily receive counseling before they become terminally ill .
So either Republicans were for death panels in 2003 before turning against them now–or they ’re lying about end - of - life counseling in order to frighten the bejeezus out of their fellow citizens and defeat health reform by any means necessary .
Which is it , Mr. Grassley ( “ Yea , ” 2003 ) ?

MEMORANDUM FOR : The President
FROM : Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity ( VIPS )
SUBJECT : Accountability for Torture
We write you , Mr. President , as former intelligence professionals to voice strong support for Attorney General Eric Holder 's authorization of a wider investigation into CIA interrogation .
We respectfully disagree with the direct appeal to you by seven former CIA directors to quash that wider investigation .
The signatories of this Memorandum are former intelligence officers and analysts who have worked with CIA directors going back as far as Allen Dulles .
Our cumulative experience totals more than 200 years .
We are encouraged by your own support for Attorney General Holder 's decision to have federal prosecutor John Durham investigate possible criminal activity by individuals engaging in torture and other violations of international agreements on the treatment of detainees .
From our own experience in intelligence , both as field operators and as senior analysts , we know that personal accountability is vital to maintaining an effective intelligence service that reflects our best traditions and the rule of law .
Among the former CIA directors who , by letter of September 18 , asked you to " reverse " the attorney general 's decision are some who were cognizant of and involved in decisions that led to the abuses in question .
We find that troubling .
Clearly , the role of CIA directors in issuing orders that led to inappropriate behavior , and their failure to hold officers accountable , helped create the environment in which abuses occurred � the ones detailed in the Special Review of the CIA Inspector General , for example .
No analytical leap is required to conclude that those particular CIA directors might have understandable interest in blocking investigation of their own complicity .
They include , first and foremost , George Tenet � many of whose misdeeds are already a matter of public record .
To mention just a few :
� Tenet was the chief enabler of torture .
He also oversaw widespread kidnapping ( " extraordinary rendition " ) , which in some cases led to torture .
� Our sources tell us that Tenet knew about the overstepping of the guidelines approved by the lawyers and that he knew the people doing it .
Rather than restrain them , he pushed them still harder , in an attempt to please his masters .
We strongly believe that investigations of possible wrongdoing cannot , in all fairness , be limited to the proverbial " bad apples at the bottom of the barrel . "
Rather , in our view , such investigations must be allowed to go wherever the evidence leads .
The inquiry last year by the Senate Armed Services Committee provides a good model for doing precisely that .
The main conclusion of the committee 's " Inquiry Into the Treatment of Detainees in U.S. Custody , " approved last fall without dissent , was captured in its first subhead :
" Presidential Order Opens the Door to Considering Aggressive Techniques . "
The Hollywood version of the CIA portrays amoral spies willing to do anything without regard to ethics or human rights .
Our own long experience persuades us that the intelligence community has an abundance of men and women of outstanding character , who are committed to the rule of law , and whose primary desire is to serve the nation and protect the American people .

The same things that make Alaska 's marine waters among the most productive in the world may also make them the most vulnerable to ocean acidification .
According to new findings by a University of Alaska Fairbanks scientist , Alaska 's oceans are becoming increasingly acidic , which could damage Alaska 's king crab and salmon fisheries .
This spring , chemical oceanographer Jeremy Mathis returned from a cruise armed with seawater samples collected from the depths of the Gulf of Alaska .
When he tested the samples ' acidity in his lab , the results were higher than expected .
They show that ocean acidification is likely more severe and is happening more rapidly in Alaska than in tropical waters .
The results also matched his recent findings in the Chukchi and Bering Seas .
" It seems like everywhere we look in Alaska 's coastal oceans , we see signs of increased ocean acidification , " said Mathis .
Often referred to as the " sister problem to climate change , " ocean acidification is a term to describe increasing acidity in the world 's oceans .
The ocean absorbs carbon dioxide from the air .
As the ocean absorbs more carbon dioxide , seawater becomes more acidic .
Scientists estimate that the ocean is 25 percent more acidic today than it was 300 years ago .
" The increasing acidification of Alaska waters could have a destructive effect on all of our commercial fisheries .
This is a problem that we have to think about in terms of the next decade instead of the next century , " said Mathis .
The ocean contains minerals that organisms like oysters and crabs use to build their shells .
Ocean acidification makes it more difficult to build shells , and in some cases the water can become acidic enough to break down existing shells .
Mathis ' recent research in the Gulf of Alaska uncovered multiple sites where the concentrations of shell - building minerals were so low that shellfish and other organisms in the region would be unable to build strong shells .

" We 're not saying that crab shells are going to start dissolving , but these organisms have adapted their physiology to a certain range of acidity .
Early results have shown that when some species of crabs and fish are exposed to more acidic water , certain stress hormones increase and their metabolism slows down .
If they are spending energy responding to acidity changes , then that energy is diverted away from growth , foraging and reproduction , " said Mathis .
Another organism that could be affected by ocean acidification is the tiny pteropod , also known as a sea butterfly or swimming sea snail .
The pteropod is at the base of the food chain and makes up nearly half of the pink salmon 's diet .
A 10 percent decrease in the population of pteropods could mean a 20 percent decrease in an adult salmon 's body weight .
" This is a case where we see ocean acidification having an indirect effect on a commercially viable species by reducing its food supply , " said Mathis .
The cold waters and broad , shallow continental shelves around Alaska 's coast could be accelerating the process of ocean acidification in the North , Mathis said .
Cold water can hold more gas than warmer water , which means that the frigid waters off Alaska 's coasts can absorb more carbon dioxide .
The shallow waters of Alaska 's continental shelves also retain more carbon dioxide because there is less mixing of seawater from deeper ocean waters .
Ask any coastal Alaskan and they will tell you that Alaska 's waters are teeming with biological life , from tiny plankton to humpback whales .
All of these animals use oxygen and emit carbon dioxide .
Mathis and other scientists call this the " biological pump . "
" We are blessed with highly productive coastal areas that support vast commercial fisheries , but this productivity acts like a pump , absorbing more and more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , " said Mathis .
" Because of this , the acidity of Alaska 's coastal seas will continue to increase , and likely accelerate , over the next decade . "
Mathis said that it is still unclear what the full range of effects of ocean acidification will be , but that it is a clear threat to Alaska 's commercial fisheries and subsistence communities .
" We need to give our policy makers and industry managers information and forecasts on ocean acidification in Alaska so they can make decisions that will keep our fisheries viable , " said Mathis .
" Ecosystems in Alaska are going to take a hit from ocean acidification .
Right now , we do n't know how they are going to respond . "

At the height of the war , more than 300 bases were scattered across Iraq .
Over the next few months , Americans hope to be at six huge bases , with 13 others being used for staging and preparing for a complete withdrawal .
The first people you encounter when driving up to an American base are not actually American .
They are usually Ugandans , employed by a private security company , Triple Canopy , and those at Balad had enough authority to delay for five hours an American Air Force captain escorting an American reporter onto the base .

The Ugandans make up only one nationality of a diverse group of workers from developing nations who sustain life on the F.O.B. ’s for American soldiers .
The largest contingents come from the Philippines , Bangladesh and India .
They live apart from both Western contractors and soldiers on base , interacting with them only as much as their jobs demand .
“ Everyone stays pretty much separate , ” said Mila , the massage therapist , whose last name could not be used out of security concerns .
She has been in Iraq a year , but she said other workers had been here as long as six years , some never taking a break to go home .
“ You miss nature , trees and grass , ” she said .
The base has two power plants , and two water treatment plants that purify 1.9 million gallons of water a day for showers and other uses .
The water the soldiers drink comes from yet another plant , run by a bottling company , which provides seven million bottles of water a month for those on base .

Douglas Blayney says a health care bill provision on end - of - life care has been completely misconstrued .
( CNN ) --
The heated national debate on health care reform has taken an unusual turn , with many eyes focused on a minor provision regarding end - of - life care embedded in the House bill .
The measure provides coverage for Medicare beneficiaries who elect to meet with their medical team once every five years to discuss options for treatment if they become seriously ill .
It 's called end - of - life care or advance care planning .
Some opponents of the House bill have expended great energy and resources in recent weeks to convince seniors that this provision will somehow result in government - sponsored euthanasia .
We have seen the volatile response to these allegations at town hall meetings across the country .
This argument is completely false .
This provision simply provides for Medicare to pay for voluntary conversations between patients and their health care practitioners on the difficult but important subject of planning for care at the end of life .
The provision is purely optional , and patients would be able to choose whether to discuss the issue with their practitioners .
For those who decide to do so , there would be clear benefits .
These discussions can include where a person wants to receive care and how physical needs , including pain , are to be managed .
The merits of broader health care reform legislation aside , there should be no controversy about the benefits of end - of - life care planning discussions .
According to a 2008 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association , these discussions have been proven to improve patient care and quality of life .
Confronting the prospect of death is n't easy for anyone .
So perhaps it 's no surprise that few people talk with their doctors , nurses or loved ones about their wishes for end - of - life care .
Surveys show that only 13 percent of Americans have established a living will laying out their desires for treatment near death , and shared it with their medical teams .
We discuss end - of - life care with patients to fulfill our commitment to them throughout the course of their care .
When a disease cannot be cured , we can assure our patients that we can make them comfortable in their last days .
When these conversations are done in advance and done well , everyone benefits -- patients , families and all members of our care teams .
As practitioners , we know from experience that discussions with patients in the end stages of their cancers and with their family members may be long and emotional , but ultimately lead to end - of - life care centered on the patient 's wishes .
We have seen many patients who were well - cared - for by their families , with professional help , and were comfortable in their surroundings .
We know , through research and through our own experience , that patients who have discussed end - of - life care make better - informed treatment decisions , experience less pain and depression , and fare better overall .
iReport.com : Share your hopes for health care reform
At some point , we all will need to make decisions about care at the end of life .
Whether ill or not , every American should think ahead about the kind of treatment they want , discuss their desires with their loved ones and their doctors and nurses , and develop living wills to document their wishes .
A new Medicare benefit that acknowledges the value of end - of - life conversations between health care practitioners and patients is long overdue and should be included in any health care reform bill .
It is good medicine and improves the lives of patients -- exactly what policymakers say they are looking for in health care reform .
More importantly , it would help all Americans live their final days with dignity and in accord with their own wishes .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas W. Blayney and Brenda Nevidjon .
All About Death and Dying • Medicare
Conservatives for Patients ’ Rights , whose ads we have faulted in the past , is airing a new spot that calls for dropping any federal insurance option from the health care overhaul bills .
" Despite what the president or Congress say , " the narrator tells us , " their health care proposals do not guarantee you can keep your own doctor . "
And there ’s no guarantee you wo n’t " wait longer for care , " face " rationing , " or " lose your insurance , " either , she says .
Why not ?
Because " the president ’s public option plan could lead to government - run health care , " says the narrator .
" Do n’t be fooled . "
On screen we see the words " Public Option Health Plan " throughout the ad .
This is n’t the first time that CPR , a group headed by former Columbia / HCA head Rick Scott , has tried to tie health care overhaul efforts to " government - run health care . "
In an ad last spring , Scott said that a federal council to gather research on which treatments work best would be the " first step " toward government control of health care .
We pointed out the problems with that leap of logic .
This time , CPR is saying that the federal health plan – which is presented as an option for individuals and very small businesses ( at first ) in the pending bills – is the route by which government is going to take over the health system , and the trigger for the clearly undesirable dangers described in the ad .
The narrator is right about those hazards :
There is " no guarantee " that they wo n’t happen .
But what CPR does n’t mention is that they could also happen – and in some cases are already occurring – under the current health care system .
Lose your own doctor ?
Many people experience that today , if their employer changes insurance plans , if they change jobs , or if they become uninsured for any reason .
Wait longer for care ?
Given the shortage of family doctors , which is only expected to worsen , we can expect wait times to increase even if the system remains untouched .
Pending overhaul legislation aims to ease that , in fact , by increasing certain payments to physicians and making other adjustments to encourage training of primary care physicians .
Rationing ?
That occurs on a regular basis today , whenever insurance companies or government programs like Medicare reject claims , or when the companies drop people who have become ill for not disclosing often minor and unrelated preexisting conditions .
Under pending legislation , insurance companies would be unable to deny coverage to individuals because of preexisting conditions .
And when it comes to losing one ’s insurance , that ’s another everyday occurrence under today ’s system , as millions of people who have lost their jobs in the recession have found .
Under the pending proposals , individuals could lose their current insurance plans , though for different reasons ; small businesses might decide to buy coverage through a newly created health insurance exchange , for instance , rather than stick with their current plans .
The big difference ?
For the vast majority , if not all , people , " losing your insurance " would simply mean switching insurance plans – not losing coverage , as many do today .
As for whether " the president ’s public option plan could lead to government - run health care , " the operative word is " could , " which makes it hard to disprove .
The real question is , how likely is it ?
As we said before , Obama has not proposed a government - run system and , in fact , has rejected the idea .
Some think it would come into being de facto , however , if vast numbers of people ditched the private system and opted for the public plan .
But under the pending Senate bill and the House Energy and Commerce Committee bill , the plan ’s cost structure would n’t be all that different from that of private insurance – so it would be unlikely to draw a huge number of takers .
The original House bill had a provider payment formula that would make the plan cheaper for consumers .
That type of plan could attract a lot of people – if eligibility was eventually expanded beyond individuals and employers with 20 or fewer workers , which is where the bill stops .
Gholam Reza Aghazadeh was named by ex-President Mohammad Khatami
The long - serving head of Iran 's Atomic Energy Organisation , Gholam Reza Aghazadeh , has resigned , Iranian media and officials have said .
The nuclear chief had submitted a letter of resignation to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad nearly three weeks ago , the Isna news agency said .
It was not immediately clear what triggered the resignation .
Iran says its nuclear programme is for civilian power , denying Western claims that it wants a nuclear bomb .
Mr Aghazadeh also stepped down as the country 's vice - president , Isna reported .
The agency said it had spoken to Mr Aghazadeh , who gave no explanation for his move but told them that Mr Ahmadinejad had accepted the resignation .
A spokesman for Iran 's atomic energy department and the official Irna news agency confirmed the news .
' Limited impact '
Mr Aghazadeh is a veteran official who served in the 1980s as a deputy to Mir Hossein Mousavi - the defeated candidate in Iran 's disputed presidential elections last month .
In 1985 he began a 12 - year stint as oil minister , staying in the post during the presidency of Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani .
He then moved to his job at the head of the atomic agency in 1997 under the reformist former president , Mohammad Khatami .
He continued in the post when Mr Ahmadinejad was first elected in 2005 .
It was not clear whether Mr Aghazadeh 's resignation was linked to Iran 's 12 June disputed presidential elections , in which Mr Ahmadinejad claimed victory .
Mr Aghazadeh has made no public comment on the turmoil that followed the vote .
Correspondents say that although Mr Aghazadeh has long supervised Iran 's nuclear programme , his resignation may have a limited impact on negotiations with Western powers , which are headed by Iranian nuclear envoy Saeed Jalili .
Control over Iran 's foreign and nuclear policies ultimately lies with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
The news of Mr Aghazadeh 's resignation came a day after US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned Iran that the US would not extend its offer of engagement indefinitely .
President Barack Obama has talked of engagement with Iran but has not made clear how that might take place .
Welcome to Peter Answers ...
Do you need to ask a question ?
Are you looking for answers ?
Peter offers you a space to ask anything you want .
However , before each question you must write a petition .
If the answer is not what you expected , at least you make catharsis and ask again .
Setting up a classroom in this way assumes that the purpose of school is to train the minds of students .
And as far as it goes , that is probably right .
The problem is that we also assume that training the mind is something separate from the body .
Now , I do n't mean that we believe that the mind is not a physical thing ( like Rene Descartes did ) .
I 'm pretty sure that most of us believe that the brain is the thing that allows us to think , and that the brain is a part of our body .
But we do often treat the brain as if it is somehow separate from the rest of the body , and so we can train it while ignoring what the rest of the body is doing .
I think that is a mistake , and over the next few posts I 'll talk about why .
There is a growing recognition within Psychology that thinking is affected by what the body is doing .
The way you think about things is influenced by what your body is doing at any given moment , and it is also influenced by what you have done in the past .
The body even affects the mind when it is not obvious that movements of the body are not really that relevant to the thinking being done .
As an example , consider studies by Shu - Ju Yang , David Gallo , and Sian Beilock in the September , 2009 issue of the Journal of Experimental Psychology : Learning , , and .
They had people sit in front of a computer with the keyboard hidden under a platform .
They saw pairs of letters on the screen and rated how much they liked them .
Later , they were shown a number of pairs of letters and asked whether they had seen them in the first part of the experiment .
So , what does this have to do with the body ?
Some of the people in the study were skilled typists , and others were unskilled typists .
The letter pairs were all pairs that would be typed with the middle and index fingers if they were typed ( though the people in the study did not have to do any typing ) .
Some of those pairs ( like BK ) were ones that would be easy to type , because they require typing one letter with each hand .
Others were pairs that would be harder to type because they would by typed with the same finger ( like FV ) .
I realize this is a pretty simple demonstration , but the ability to recognize things you have seen before is an important part of the learning process .
Results like this make clear that experience performing actions affects your ability to separate those things you remember from those things you do not .
I 'll talk more about connections between mind and body in the next post .
The aim of the experiment is to recreate the conditions that existed a fraction of a second after the Big Bang – the birth of the universe – and provide vital clues to the building blocks of life .

The band ended their set with Everything In Its Right Place , from album Kid A
Radiohead have delighted the crowd at Reading with some of their old classics in the second of two weekend festival shows - their only 2009 UK appearances .
Thom Yorke and co began the set , which was markedly different from that played at the Leeds Festival the night before , with 1993 fans ' favourite Creep .
Festival - goers were then treated to a slew of vintage songs including five from 1997 album OK Computer .
Fan Alex Sternberg , 40 , hailed the two - hour show as a " pretty awesome effort " .
I thought it was great , a fantastic live show with old songs and new songs
Fan Alex Sternberg " Reckoner [ from latest album In Rainbows ] was good ; most of the stuff from OK Computer 's brilliant , " the doctor , from Oxford , said .
" I thought it was great , a fantastic live show with old songs and new songs . "
" I thought the new song , These Are My Twisted Words , was very good . "
For Mr Sternberg and other Radiohead fans , though , the release of the song as a one - off free download could spell the end of an era .
One - off releases Earlier this month , singer Yorke , 40 , said making albums had " just become a real drag " for the band , suggesting they would concentrate on one - off releases .
These also include the band 's release through their website of Harry Patch ( In Memory Of ) , a song about the last British survivor of the World War I trenches .
Thom Yorke kept the audience amused with witty one - liners in between songs Given the enduring quality of the likes of The Bends , Kid A and , of course , OK Computer , it is to be hoped this is not a long - term policy .
On Sunday night , the band played OK Computer tracks Climbing Up The Walls , Exit Music ( For a Film ) , Lucky , Paranoid Android and Karma Police .
Perhaps the most spiritual moment of the night came during Karma Police when the entire crowd sang along with Yorke 's repeated mantra - like line : " For a minute there , I lost myself , I lost myself . "
Close competition for that title , though , came during Street Spirit ( Fade Out ) , from 1995 album The Bends , when the crowd again sang along as one : " And fade out again , and fade out again . "
The band - who shared the bill with , among others , Bloc Party and Vampire Weekend - also played seven songs from 2007's In Rainbows .
The Radiohead live experience is enriched by their ability to build songs to crescendos - pumped full of adrenaline by the guitar heroics of Jonny Greenwood - that transcend even those of their recorded masterpieces .
The show 's set - which featured a series of tubular bell - like giant lights as well as creative split screens of the different band members - was the perfect compliment to Radiohead 's often abstract sound .
The spectacle of Yorke 's idiosyncratic freaky dancing , meanwhile , will also stay in the memory for some time to come .
Natural sound
On record , Radiohead have organically merged electronica with rock music in a way that is unmatched by their peers .
On Sunday night , the electronic rhythms of tracks like Idioteque , from 2000 's Kid A ; The Gloaming , from 2003 's Hail To The Thief ; and 15 Step , from In Rainbows , were beefed up by drummer Phil Selway in a similarly natural - sounding way .
At the start of 15 Step - a track which has five beats in every bar rather than the usual four of most rock music - the band ambitiously started clapping out a rhythm which it encouraged the crowd to join in with .
Only Radiohead would attempt such a feat .
Needless to say , the audience failed miserably to join in with the syncopated pattern .

Met warns officers off photographers
The return of copper plate photography ?
By John Oates
Posted in Policing , 9th July 2009 12:59 GMT
The Metropolitan Police has issued guidance to its officers to remind them that using a camera in public is not in itself a terrorist offence [...]
However , the actual Metropolitan Police Service Photography advice web page is not a comprehensive guide to the relevant legislation and legal powers , for an amateur or professional photographer and for the Police Constables and Police Community Support Officers ( PCSO ) who are meant to enforce them fairly and proportionately .
The web page mentions the Terrorism Act 2000 section 43 ( stop and search with " reasonable suspicion " ) , section 44 ( stop and search without reasonable suspicion ) and section 58A ( eliciting , publishing or communicating information about current or former members of the armed forces , intelligence services or police constables , but not PCSOs etc . )
It sheds no light on where exactly the controversial Terrorism Act 2000 section 44 powers are actually in force , According to the Statute , they are supposed to be temporary , and strictly limited to a specific location and for a limited duration , not general purpose police powers available all everywhere , at all times .
However the Home office is still trying to keep the extent of the use of these powers secret from the public , thereby ruining any deterrent effect , and simply increasing the fear , mistrust and hatred of the Police - see the progress of the Spy Blog Freedom of Information
Act request on this topic :
ICO serves an Information Notice on the Home Office re our complaint about the Terrorism Act 2000 s44 stop and search Authorisations
The Met Police Advice on Photography web page also omits mention of the Official Secrets Act 1911 Prohibited Places , which no longer applies to some buildings which it used to , before Gordon Brown ; 's failed Public / Private Finance Initiatives tax dofge schemes .
Former Government owned office buildings , including the Ministry of Defence and the HM Treasury buildings in Whitehall , and the Home Office now in Marsham Street , and the Ministry of Justice ( in the redeveloped former Home Office buildings in St Anne 's Gate / Petty France ) are now owned by property companies based in foreign tax havens , which lease the poperties back to the Government .
As such these buildings are no longer automatically " Prohibited Places " under the OSA 1911 , like they used to be , by virtue of ownership by the Crown , and they have not been specifically designated by a Secretary of State as being so .
However , there are Prohibited Places , where it is a non-arrestible criminal offence ( prosecution of which still requires the permission of the Attorney General ) to make make " models , plans , sketches " etc , including photographs , in the vicinity of , typically military bases which are stillowned by the Crown .
Later legislation also designates any Licensed Nuclear Site i.e. nuclear power stations , research laboratories and re-processing plants etc , and any " aerodrome " owned by the Civil Aviation Authority i.e. Heathrow Airport etc .
See Current Prohibited Places under the Official Secrets Act 1911
None of these Prohibited Places actually ban photography by the public for innocent , non-espionage purposes , but the burden of proof seems to shift to the photographer having to prove his innocence .
What is also needed is a similar statement from the notorious British Transport Police , who , disproportionately , conduct even more unnecessary and counterproductive Terrorism Act 2000 section 44 stop and searches than the Met Police do .
There is plenty of evidence that some Police forces seem to be trying to cover up their obnoxious policy of racial profiling , by indulging in even more stupid racial profiling to " balance the figures " on section 44 stops and searches etc. - see the Report on the Operation in 2008 of the Terrorism Act 2000 and of part 1 of the Terrorism Act 2006 by Lord Carlile
In London , there are by - laws against commercial photography and filing , without prior permission ( and payment of fees ) in areas such as Trafalgar Square or Parliament Square , and on the whole of the London Underground railway Tube network .
Remember that Private Security Guards or even Police Community Support Officers acting on their own without a real , sworn , Police Constable in Uniform physically present , cannot exercise any of these powers , no matter how many yellow or orange high visibility vests or " official " Security Industry Authority photo id badges they sport .

Why Borderline Hysteric Southern Mothers Are Superior

But as Greg Sargent pointed out this afternoon , CNN is now refusing to air the ad because " it unnecessarily singles out an individual company and person . "
What on earth is going on at CNN ?
The network — already taking criticism for declining to run an ad criticizing Lou Dobbs — is now refusing to run an ad nationally criticizing the insurance industry , the group that tried to place the ad tells me .
CNN ’s reason :
The ad “ unnecessarily ” singles out a top insurance industry executive by name for criticism .
...
That very well may be CNN ’s policy .
But AUC maintains that the mention of Cigna ’s CEO was necessary to dramatize the enormous stake the insurance industry has in the health care wars .
What ’s more , AUC argues , the industry is made up of companies that are run by individuals deciding how to spend huge money to impact the health care debate — so why are they off limits ?
“ The bottom line question is : Would CNN run ads from Cigna that are positive about the company ? ”
Funk asks .
“ If yes , why would they turn down an ad critical of the company for their role in trying to kill health insurance reform ? ”
It 's hard to have a conversation about health insurance reform when you can't talk about the health insurers who are made the health insurance mess in the first place and are profiting while 14,000 Americans lose their health insurance daily .
They have always had the power to stop disqualifying people with pre-existing conditions , " rescinding " policies when policy holders get seriously ill , and raising premiums based on past medical history .
But they have n't done any of those things because it would hurt their bottom line .
So we ( American 's United For Change ) have set up petition to CNN asking them to allow us to air the ad .
At the end of the day CNN is doing a disservice to their viewers if we can't talk about health insurance companies while the nation is debating health insurance reform .
* I'm proud to work with American 's United For Change on their advocacy campaigns .
Updated title to make it clear that it 's not an ad for health insurance . ;)
Thanks for the recommendations .
NEW YORK �( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stocks were little changed Friday after a report showed the pace of the recession is slowing , but the market managed to post its best July in decades .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) and the S&P 500 ( SPX ) index both gained a few points Friday , closing at the highest levels since November .
The Nasdaq composite ( COMP ) lost a few points after ending the previous session at a nearly 10 - month high .
Stocks seesawed through most of Friday , as investors focused on the positives in the morning 's GDP report and the latest batch of quarterly results .
But investors were a bit wary at the end of an otherwise big July on Wall Street .
Stocks have been surging as investors have reacted positively to quarterly results and economic news that have been better than forecast , but still not strong .
" There 's a constant bid in the market , you can't knock it down , " said Joseph Saluzzi , co-head of equity trading at Themis Trading .
He said the news over the last few weeks has n't been especially positive , just not as bad as expected .
But the bullish sentiment has taken over and investors have been jumping in out of fear of missing the rally .
For the month , the Dow gained 8.6 % , its best July since 1989 when it gained 9 % and its best monthly performance since Oct. 2002 when it gained 10.6 % .
The S&P 500 gained 7.4 % , its best July since 1988 , when it gained 8.8 % and its best monthly performance since this past April , when it gained 9.4 % .
The Nasdaq was up 7.8 % in the month , its best July since 1997 , when it gained 10.5 % .
It was the Nasdaq 's best month overall since this past April , when it gained 12.4 % .
" Looking out over the next month or so , I would n't bet against the market , but we 've had such a run that it would n't be unreasonable to see a correction , " said James King , chief investment officer at National Penn Investors Trust .
GDP : The pace of economic decline slowed in the second quarter , the government said Friday morning , raising hopes that the recession is winding down .
GDP , the broadest measure of U.S. economic activity , shrank at a 1 % annual rate in the April - through - June period .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com thought GDP would shrink at a faster 1.5 % rate .
The results reflected a smaller decline in exports as the result of higher consumer prices and more government spending .
" There are some positive signs in the report , but there 's not a clear sign that we are moving back to growth just yet , " said King .
" I think that 's why you 're seeing a mild reaction in the markets . "
GDP has declined for four quarters in a row , hitting the nadir in the first quarter , which was revised lower to a decline of 6.4 % from the originally reported drop of 5.5 % .
In the fourth quarter of 2008 , GDP dipped at a 5.4 % annual rate .
The two quarters represent the biggest quarterly declines in 26 years .
In other economic news , the House of Representatives voted to add $ 2 billion to the popular cash - for - clunkers program , which has been running low on funds .
The Senate will vote on the bill Monday .
The program is seen as having already started to help lift auto sales .
The Chicago PMI , a regional read on manufacturing , rose to 43.4 in July from 39.9 in June .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com thought it would rise to 43 .
Quarterly results : Dow component Chevron ( CVX , Fortune 500 ) reported a 71 % drop in second - quarter profit due to oil and gas prices and lower demand for fuel in a global economic slowdown .
The No. 2 oil producer said it earned 87 cents per share versus $ 2.69 a year earlier .
Economists surveyed by Thomson Reuters thought it would earn 97 cents per share .
Shares gained 2.6 % .
On Thursday , No. 1 oil producer Exxon Mobil ( XOM , Fortune 500 ) , also a Dow component , reported a 66 % drop in quarterly profit .
Shares of Exxon ended lower Friday .
Late Thursday , Walt Disney ( DIS , Fortune 500 ) reported weaker earnings that topped estimates on weaker revenue that missed estimates .
Shares of the Dow component slipped 4.2 % Friday .
Also late Thursday , Las Vegas Sands ( LVS ) reported a wider quarterly loss as the recession cut into profits at its casinos and hotels .
The company reported weaker quarterly earnings that topped estimates and weaker revenue that missed estimates .
On Friday , a number of analysts downgraded the company or warned about its capital position .
Shares slumped 16 % in unusually active New York Stock Exchange trading Friday .
Ford Motor ( F , Fortune 500 ) shares rallied , with economists estimating that the Cash for Clunkers program will help boost auto sales .
Market breadth was mixed .
On the New York Stock Exchange , winners topped losers three to two on volume of 1.52 billion shares .
On the Nasdaq , decliners topped advancers by a narrow margin on volume of 2.29 billion shares ..
Bonds : Treasury prices rallied , lowering the yield on the benchmark 10 - year note to 3.48 % from 3.60 % late Thursday .
Treasury prices and yields move in opposite directions .
Other markets :
In global trading , European markets ended mixed in afternoon trading and Asian markets ended higher .
U.S. light crude oil for September delivery rose $ 2.53 to settle at $ 69.45 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
In currency trading , the dollar fell versus the euro and the Japanese yen .
COMEX gold for December delivery rose $ 18.50 to settle at $ 955.80 an ounce .
" The notion that I should somehow have got myself tested or passed in order to do this is absurd .
I know there has to be security in schools , and that 's fine , but this is insulting and does n't go any way to protecting children . "

( CNN ) -- Two U.S. journalists who had been detained by North Korea were traveling back to the United States with former President Clinton hours after being pardoned , a Clinton spokesman said .
Former President Clinton meets Tuesday with North Korea leader Kim Jong Il .
" They are en route to Los Angeles [ California ] where Laura and Euna will be reunited with their families , " said spokesman Matt McKenna .
Doug Ling , Laura 's father , reacted to the news outside his home in Carmichael , California , with , " One of the best days in my life ... I figured , sooner or later , they 'd be back . "
In Los Angeles , family friend Welly Yang said the Ling family had " done everything they could , while respecting the North Korean government , to try and get Laura home . "
He predicted that Ling would remain a journalist .
" Despite this terrifying experience , I can't imagine that Laura would give up her passion to tell stories that otherwise would n't be heard . "
Their release Wednesday came after Clinton met with top government officials in Pyongyang .
" Clinton expressed words of sincere apology to Kim Jong
Il for the hostile acts committed by the two American journalists against the DPRK after illegally intruding into it , " the news agency reported .
" Clinton courteously conveyed to Kim Jong
Il an earnest request of the U.S. government to leniently pardon them and send them back home from a humanitarian point of view .
" The meetings had candid and in - depth discussions on the pending issues between the DPRK and the U.S. in a sincere atmosphere and reached a consensus of views on seeking a negotiated settlement of them . "
Watch Ling 's father welcome his daughter 's pardon »
The report said Clinton then conveyed a message from President Obama " expressing profound thanks for this and reflecting views on ways of improving the relations between the two countries . "
But White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters in Washington before the announced agreement that Clinton was not carrying any message -- written or oral -- from Obama .
Gibbs added that the former president last spoke with Obama during a White House visit in March .
He described Clinton 's trip as a " solely private mission to secure the release of two Americans . "
The report from the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea , the nation 's official name , described the agreement to release the journalists as " a manifestation of the DPRK 's humanitarian and peace - loving policy .
" The DPRK visit of Clinton and his party will contribute to deepening the understanding between the DPRK and the U.S. and building the bilateral confidence . "
Ling and Lee are reporters for California - based Current TV -- a media venture launched by Clinton 's former vice president , Al Gore .
The women were arrested in March while reporting from the border between North Korea and China for California - based Current Media and sentenced in June to 12 years in prison on charges of entering the country illegally to conduct a smear campaign .
Because the United States has no diplomatic relations with North Korea , efforts to resolve the issue had been handled through Sweden , which represents U.S. interests in Pyongyang .
" We want to thank the Obama administration for its continuous and determined efforts to achieve this outcome , and President Clinton for his willingness to undertake this mission , " Current Media co-founders Gore and Joel Hyatt said in a written statement .
" All of us at Current are overjoyed at Laura and Euna 's safe return .
Our hearts go out to them -- and to their families -- for persevering through this horrible experience . "
The visit by the former president , whose wife , Hillary Clinton , is the Obama administration 's secretary of state , came about three weeks after the United States dropped a request that Ling and Lee be released on humanitarian grounds .
Instead , the United States was seeking amnesty for the women , Hillary Clinton said .
Watch what may lie behind the pick of Bill Clinton »
Clinton 's mission came as the United States and its allies in the region are seeking to persuade North Korea to return to nuclear disarmament talks , which have stalled .
North Korea conducted its second nuclear bomb test in May and has conducted several missile tests since .
The United Nations has responded to those tests by tightening and expanding sanctions on the nation .
North Korea and the United States were on opposite sides in the 1950 - 1953 Korean War and had no regular contacts before a 1994 crisis over North Korea 's nuclear program .
North Korea agreed then to halt the development of nuclear weapons but abandoned that accord and withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003 .
Former President Clinton had considered visiting North Korea in 2000 near the end of his second term as president .
His secretary of state , Madeleine Albright , had gone to Pyongyang in early 2000 to meet with Kim .
The 67 - year - old North Korean leader is widely reported to have suffered a stroke a year ago and is believed to be grooming his youngest son , Kim Jon Un , as his successor .
CNN 's Elaine Quijano , Charlie Moore and Ninette Sosa contributed to this report .

Park lies in a very urban milieu , it is surrounded by a congress center buildings , on the edge of China town , International quarter and Old Montreal .
It is public and therefore accessible to all by - passers for a short rest , coffee break or a deep contemplation .
It ’s not an easy job for a landscape architect to design a good roof park on a top of a garage .
The biggest risk is choice of vegetation , since there is not much soil to put the trees in .
Consequently , trees might die if layer of soil in which they grow , was too thin , which does not apply to most bushes , shrubs and flowers .
This park is indeed a very colorful combination of trees and shrubs , which bloom pink in spring and turn yellow in autumn .
Project was awarded by Canadian Society of Landscape Architects ( Regional Honor ) .

Create an ooRexx build environment on Linux KVM
Kernel Virtual Machine improves build performance
Recently , the Open Object Rexx project ( ooRexx ; see Related topics later in this article for more info ) converted its old on - demand software build system from VMware - hosted guest operating systems to Linux Kernel Virtual Machine ( KVM ) - hosted guests .
This change provided a more efficient build environment and reduced the build times for users .
The ooRexx software build system allows developers to build ooRexx software packages for multiple x86 - based platforms and operating systems .
Currently , the supported guest operating systems include Windows ® XP ( i386 ) , Fedora 10 ( i386 and x86_64 ) , and Ubuntu 8.04 ( i386 ) .
These guest operating systems can produce ooRexx installation and documentation packages for Windows ( EXE ) , Fedora and openSUSE ( RPM ) , and Ubuntu ( DEB ) .
Other x86 - based operating systems will come online as demanded by the developers and users of ooRexx .
This article shows how to create your own software build system , taking the ooRexx development team 's setup as an example and including tips and direction as needed for developers experienced with ooRexx , Apache , and Linux .
You can download the server and guest scripts at the end of this article .
As designed , the system is specifically for building the ooRexx software , but the concepts can be applied to a general purpose build system for any software .
The broad requirements for this system include the following :
You need a Web interface for generating the build request .
You need a Web interface for retrieving the build results .
You need support for multiple guest operating systems .
Guest operating systems must perform fully automated builds .
An e-mail should be generated and sent to the requesting user at the end of the build .
To accommodate these requirements , the development team and I used a quad - core Xeon - based server .
The server contains 4GB of memory and 250 GB of disk space .
We chose the Fedora 10 x86_64 distribution as the main operating system mainly due to the stability and up - to - date release of KVM used by the distribution .
Your choice of hardware and software may be different , but the main hardware criterion is that your processor should have hardware virtualization available — it 's a must in order to use KVM .
Set up the server
The first step in setting up the build server is to determine the partitioning scheme .
We decided to segregate the Web store and the images for the guest operating systems into separate partitions .
We set aside 50GB for the Web store and about 150GB for the /var partition where the guest images are placed .
The rest was divided between the /home partition and the /root partition .
General requirements of a build system Some of the more basic requirements of a build system include : Frequent builds to catch problems as early as possible
Faster builds ( the faster they are , the more you can do )
Incremental build processing ( or build avoidance ) to reflect small development updates
Support for managing ( at least the low - level ) source code dependencies to keep your system as flexible as possible
Extraction / reporting capabilities on build , compile , and link usage
A reporting system that can trace source to binary matching ( efficiently comparing the old to the new )
The ability to report on build status and things like testing pass or fail
The ability to create release notes and system documentation
Next , we installed the main operating system using the Fedora 10 x86_64 release distribution .
If you 're setting up your own system , you 'll save yourself a lot of trouble if you do the following :
Enable hardware virtualization via the machine 's BIOS prior to starting the installation so that Fedora will see that KVM is available .
Perform a custom install of the software components so that you can select the Fedora virtualization options .
After we installed the server operating system , we configured it for access by the guest operating systems .
This involved enabling Samba for the Windows guests and NFS for the Linux guests .
This gives the guests access to the build results partition so they can store their build files for access by the user .
Both the main Samba share and the main NFS export point to the same location for all guests .
Next , we configured the Apache Web server to provide access to the build request system , which I discuss below under
The build requests , and the build results repository .
One configuration decision you will need to make concerns the networking option for the guests .
The default installation is configured to supply a private internal network for all guests .
A class C network is provided along with a DHCP server to provide IP addresses to the guests .
The other option is to set up the system so that one of the network devices acts as a bridge to the server external network .
This will need to be configured by hand .
You can see an example of how to configure your server for this option at the libvirt Wiki ( see Related topics for a link ) .
Create the guests
There are two approaches to creating guests for use by KVM .
In the first approach , you create just the guests you need to meet your requirements .
The second way takes a more long - range approach to creating guests .
This is the method we used to create guests , and we recommend it as a standard approach if the necessary resources are available .
We first determined the number and types of guests from the requirements .
We needed operating systems to create software built for those environments and another operating system for creating the documentation .
It turned out that in our case , the documentation and i386 RPM tasks could be combined and handled by a single guest .
Here are the guests and tasks assigned to them :
Windows XP ( i386 ) : Build the Windows install executable .
Fedora 10 ( i386 ) : Build the i386 RPM file and the documentation ZIP file .
Fedora 10 ( x86_64 ) : Build the x86_64 RPM file .
Ubuntu 8.04 ( i386 ) : Build the DEB file .
The approach we used created the previously mentioned guests as images that could be cloned at a later time .
So , each guest had a basic version that we kept for later cloning and a customized clone of that guest that performed the actual build task .
Cloning a KVM guest is really easy .
The virt - clone script provided by Fedora 10 can completely automate the task .
Listing 1 . Fedora 10 's virt - clone script
$ virt - clone --original=Fedora10-i386- Base \ --name=Fedora10-i386 -Build \ -- file=/var/lib/libvirt/images/Fedora10-i386-Build.img
The original option specifies the name of the guest operating system as it is known to the virtual machine manager .
The name option specifies the name of the new guest .
The file option specifies the file name of the new image file for the guest .
This will completely clone an existing guest and copy it to a new version of the guest .
It will also modify the MAC address of the new guest as well as the UUID .
Thus , the original guest is preserved for further cloning , if necessary , and a new guest is provided for your customization .
One thing about the virt - clone script should be noted :
If the original guest has an unconnected device , such as a CD - ROM , the script will fail .
All unconnected devices must be removed prior to cloning the guest .
If necessary , you can add them back after the cloning operation .
Once the basic build guests were created , each was then customized for the build task .
The Windows XP guest was the most challenging in this area , because the Visual C++ compiler and Software Development Kit needed to be installed as part of the customization .
The Linux guests required practically no customization except for installing NFS on the Ubuntu guest .
The build requests
All the build guests require one additional customization : Open Object Rexx version 3.2 must be installed on each of them .
Why ?
Because a script written in ooRexx controls the request and build process on each guest .
The script accesses a TCP / IP port on the build machine server to search for build requests .
If a request is found , the build process is invoked and a set of installation files ( RPM , DEB , EXE ) , along with a build report , is created and stored on the build machine server for access via HTTP by the user .
The ooRexx build request script is smart enough to not duplicate an already built version of the software .
It also notifies the user via e-mail that the build is finished and provides a URL to the location on the build machine server where the build was stored .
Build requests are generated via a CGI script on the build machine server .
The user visits an HTTP Web page and requests a build on their choice of operating system .
The Apache server then invokes the CGI script , which places the request in a queue .
The build guests are then responsible for accessing those requests and performing the requested operation .
The results of the build are also available via the Web site for download .
As mentioned above , the code for both the server and the build guest clients is available for download below .
All the scripts are written in ooRexx and should be easy to follow .
The following files are included :
buildserver.rex :
This script runs on the Web server and maintains the queues that the guest operating systems use to look for work .
: This script runs on the Web server and maintains the queues that the guest operating systems use to look for work .
buildd.rex :
This script runs on each guest operating system and accesses the queues on the Web server looking for work .
Each guest has only one queue for which it is responsible and thus will build only one kind of output file .
: This script runs on each guest operating system and accesses the queues on the Web server looking for work .
Each guest has only one queue for which it is responsible and thus will build only one kind of output file .
simq.cls :
This file is not a script but is a class file used by the buildserver .rex script .
: This file is not a script but is a class file used by the buildserver .rex script .
socket.cls :
This class file is used by the buildd .rex script .
: This class file is used by the buildd .rex script .
streamsocket.cls :
This class file is also used by the buildd .rex script .
The build results
The results of a build are placed on the Web site by the build guests .
The builds are organized such that each Subversion revision has its own subdirectory to contain all the platform guest builds for that revision .
Also , each platform guest produces a build report that is also stored in the revision subdirectory .
The build report is an absolute necessity for all this to really work .
If an error occurs during the build , and the final output files are not produced , the user must have a way to discover what went wrong .
So , the build process on each guest always produces a build report and stores it in the build repository .
The build repository location segregates the ooRexx software builds from the documentations builds .
The documentation build produces a large number of output files , so it was deemed convenient to separate those builds from the software builds .
Currently , there is no automated build cleanup process .
The project does not produce enough output to make that necessary at this time .
Conclusion
By switching from VMware build guests to Linux KVM guests , build times for each guest are reduced by as much as 50 percent .
This means the development cycle for ooRexx has also been reduced .
The ooRexx development team is by far the largest user group of the build machine , but during the alpha and beta cycles for major releases , a large number of ooRexx users also make use of the environment .
This allows users to provide timely feedback for any bug fixes or enhancements made to ooRexx .
One of the most - used build guests is the documentation builder .
All the ooRexx documentation is coded in DocBook .
This makes the documentation hard to build on a Windows system without some experience with DocBook in that environment .
This is a real problem for most of our developers and users .
By providing a documentation build process that everyone can access , we ensure that developers and users can contribute to and maintain the documentation .
This has produced documentation for ooRexx that is much better than most open source projects , a source of pride for our development team .

( CNN ) -- Peter Gathungu walks more than a mile to a shopping center , where he pays a sizable sum to charge his cell phone .
The solar phone is expected to be a great success in Kenya .
That 's because electricity is nonexistent in Gathungu 's hometown of Njoro , in northwest Kenya .
Landlines and other forms of communication are not as efficient , so Gathungu and millions of others in emerging nations rely on mobile phones .
Charging the phones can be a headache in towns and villages where electricity is scarce .
Gathungu 's troubles may soon be over , though .
Kenya 's biggest mobile phone company , Safaricom Ltd. , launched the nation 's first solar - charged phone this month .
The handset comes with a regular electrical charger and a solar panel that charges the phone using the sun 's rays , company CEO Michael Joseph told CNN by telephone .
Retailing at about $ 35 , the phones were manufactured by Chinese telecommunications company ZTE Corp .
Safaricom plans to make an initial supply of 100,000 phones available .
" People are excited about these phones , " Joseph said .
" I expect to be sold out in a week . "
Eco-friendly phones have been touted by several companies at global trade shows , but most have not been launched yet .
Samsung unveiled a solar - powered phone at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona , Spain , earlier this year and introduced its first sun-powered phone in India in mid-June .
The company expects its Solar Guru model to perform well in India , another country where electrical supply can be erratic .
Unlike many technological innovations , the solar phone is making its big splash in developing nations , where the need is the greatest .
After the Solar Guru is in circulation in India , Samsung said , it plans to launch similar phones in other Asian markets , Europe and Latin America .
For the time being , Kenyans are happy to serve as early adopters .
" The power crisis here has been going on for ages , " Joseph said , adding that the Safaricom phone 's solar panel is small and portable , unlike charging devices some Kenyans now use .
Only about 1.3 million of Kenya 's 37 million people are connected to the national electrical grid , said Migwi Theuri , a spokesman for Kenya Power and Lighting Co .
The east African nation , which gets most of its energy from hydro - generation , has been undergoing power rationing after a three - year drought .
Despite the limited availability of power , Kenya has one of the most vibrant cell phone markets in Africa , analysts say .
An estimated 17 million Kenyans use mobile phones .
Some charge phones on bicycle - run generators , Joseph said .
Or like , Gathungu , they pay businesses in major cities to charge their phones , sometimes waiting an entire day .
" There 's an enormous need for a device like this , " Joseph said of the solar phone , which can charge during talk time , as long as there are rays .
" They will continue to charge on natural light , even on cloudy days , " he added .
Gathungu plans to buy one of the new environmentally friendly phones .
For him , it 's a matter of money and convenience .
He earns 4,000 Kenya shillings ( $ 53 dollars ) a month as a waiter .
Charging his phone for 50 shillings ( 70 cents ) a week adds up .
The solar phone would pay for itself , Gathungu said .
Until he buys one , he 'll keep making the trek to the shopping center every Sunday afternoon after church .
He would n't go into further detail about his mobile phone woes , not wanting to waste his battery charge on the call .

THE existing formula is simple .
When vaccinating against influenza , inoculate those most susceptible to the disease 's wrath .
Such vulnerable types include the elderly ( who are the most likely to die if infected ) and infants ( whose immune systems are not fully developed ) .
This seems a reasonable policy , and it is the one that has long been promulgated by America 's Centres for Disease Control ( CDC ) .
Only recently has it been extended to include children up to the age of 18 , on the basis that they are more likely than other people to catch flu in the first place , through enforced socialising at school — even though they are at little risk of dying from it .
According to Jan Medlock of Clemson University in South Carolina , and Alison Galvani of Yale , however , vaccinating those most at risk of bad effects is not the right way to deal with the disease .
In a report published this week in Science , they argue that even with the extension of vaccination to school - age children , the existing policy of protecting the individual is still playing down the real public - health value of vaccines — namely that they create a so - called herd immunity which helps to break the disease 's chain of transmission .
They argue that it would be better to concentrate on vaccinating those most likely to spread the virus — both schoolchildren and people between the ages of 30 and 40 , who are likely to be the parents of those children , and who are , at the moment , at the bottom of the vaccination priority list .
That , at least , is the outcome of their mathematical model of how influenza spreads .
Indeed , it is almost all of the outcomes .
For in order to obtain a robust result , Drs Medlock and Galvani considered two different sorts of epidemic and five different definitions of an optimal conclusion .
As model epidemics they chose those of 1918 ( the famous “ Spanish ” flu that is reckoned to have killed 50 m - 100 m ) and 1957 ( less lethal , but still pretty nasty ) .
As definitions of a good outcome they started with two simple measures : the number of infections averted , and the number of deaths averted .
They then went on to look at more sophisticated measures : the number of years of life saved ( taking into account the ages of those who would otherwise have died ) , the “ contingent valuation ” of those lives and the economic cost of vaccinating .
Contingent valuation is based on surveys of the “ disutility ” of death at different ages .
This provides a crude way to balance what has already been invested in a life against what might come of it .
Measuring economic costs weighs the expense of both vaccination and illness against the net present value of the future earnings of someone who would otherwise die from the disease .
Yet no matter which outcome was looked at , nor which pattern of epidemic was chosen , the result was the same .
The best approach to influenza is to vaccinate young people and their parents , not infants and the elderly .
Moreover , it is a cheaper and more efficient option .
Around 85 m doses of vaccine are distributed in the United States in normal years .
Dr Medlock and Dr Galvani reckon that if their approach were followed , that might be cut to just over 60m .
As luck would have it , though , the new advice agrees more closely with the recommendations of the CDC 's advisory committee on immunisation practices about the best approach to the epidemic of N1H1 swine flu that is now circulating .
For reasons still unknown , elderly people are not as susceptible to this strain as they are to others , and what deaths there have been have tended to occur among the young — particularly young adults .
The strategy of “ vaccinate those at risk ” thus coincides with “ vaccinate the spreaders ” .
A fortunate coincidence , perhaps .
The RSPCA says it will try to prosecute any jockey who whips a racehorse more than 18 times , after the Australian Racing Board refused an appeal from jockeys who disagree with the board 's new rules .
Last night jockeys decided to postpone threatened strike action and weekend race meetings will go ahead .
But jockeys have promised to strike if the matter is not resolved by Monday night , a move that could jeopardise Victoria 's Spring Racing Carnival .
But they are still angry they can only whip a horse 18 times under new rules ordered by the Australian Racing Board last month .
The jockeys claim the reduced number of whip strikes compromises their safety .
Dr Hugh Wirth , president of the RSPCA in Victoria , says stewards will have to police the new rule , counting the number of times a jockey whips his or her horse in every single race .
He says the RSCPA will try to prosecute any jockey who whips their horse more than 18 times .
" Those protesting about the whipping laws now are a minority bunch of redneck jockeys , " he said .
" If it comes to the point that the Australian Racing Board attitude does not have supremacy , then it 's time , I fervently believe , that the RSPCA takes a test case to the magistrate 's court and insists that Section 9 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
Act is in fact in force against some errant jockey .
" If any person , myself included , went outside right now and whipped our horse or some other horse , we would be prosecuted under the act .
" It 's only by tradition that it 's been left in the hands of the racing stewards to police the law , and they 've done a very poor job . "
Races abandoned
In Hawkesbury and Ballarat yesterday afternoon , jockeys interrupted their race meetings with strike action .
In Ballarat five races had to be abandoned .
Shane Brennan , with the Ballarat Turf Club , says it meant a massive loss of revenue to the industry .
" [ It 's an ] inconvenience and financial loss to the owners , trainers who have travelled to Ballarat and prepared their day around a race meeting , " he said .
" Now it 's been abandoned , so there 's a severe financial loss to be incurred by all participants . "
With the threat of strike action hanging over the weekend 's races , jockeys and their representatives took part in a national phone hook - up last night .
The jockeys decided to suspend strike action until next Monday , when they will deliver an ultimatum to the Australian Racing Board calling for the new rule to be scrapped .
Des O'Keefe from the Australian Jockeys '
Association says horse welfare is at the front of the industry 's mind all the time .
" It 's encouragement for an athletic horse to do its best , not under pain or discomfort , " he said .
" It 's also been a tool of the trade to correct horses that are running in or running out . "
The Australian Racing Board and jockeys agree a padded whip does not hurt a horse , but Dr Hugh Wirth says that is nonsensical .
" If a whip does n't hurt the horse , why whip it ? " he said .
" The need to whip a horse in order to make it perform better has long been disproved , that in fact we should convert from any form of whipping whatsoever to simply hands and heels riding . "
Spring carnival in jeopardy
Mr O'Keeffe says further disruptions to events including the Spring Carnival have not been ruled out .
" In the interests of this industry , we need the ARB to come back to us , " he said .
" The door is open for them to come back .
It was shut yesterday in no uncertain terms by them .
We need them to come back so that the racing can continue , not as of the spring carnival , but as of Tuesday . "
He says Australian jockeys are aware of their responsibilities to their fellow stakeholders .
" But we also need the Australian Racing Board to be aware of its responsibilities to their stakeholders , " he said .
" They 're not , at the moment .
We need them to take on that responsibility , which they 're charged with having . "
Racing Victoria says it is confident the matter will be resolved before the Spring Racing Carnival is due to start on September 30 .
The new restrictions will be reviewed in February next year .
In the meantime jockeys are not ruling out further strike action .

PDF Version IN SEARCH OF THE NEW NEW PROGRAMMING THING
We are now emerging from the dark period earlier in the decade and many in the community are bemoaning the good old days when new languages appeared with great frequency and new paradigms abounded .
Unfortunately , we find ourselves in a world which increasingly ignores the experiences of past successes and failures to claim inventor rights are the new new thing .
Simple techno sound bites are easy to communicate using the web and academics have become as adept as major marketers in spin and mindshare capture .
Rather than evolving from the best of what we know to the better , each new thing in our field seems to need to kill off those that came before it .
A recent PhD student remarked that it was very upsetting to have to read old papers published in the mid to late 70s that contain immature versions of their new ideas which they must now read and cite .
It sometimes appears that scholarly work in our field is no longer a badge of honor but a burden forced on graduate students who have grumpy old supervisors .
We seem to be in denial that our industry is maturing , we are losing our elders , some of us do n’t code any more and many of our new things are really good ideas from 20 or more years ago .
Some good old ideas reappear because the technology is now available to commercially exploit them ; others become popular because they provide a better approach to solving a particular problem .
Reinvention and improvement of good old ideas is both scholarly and sound engineering provided the prior art is cited and explained as opposed to hyped or even patented .
This means we need to look for the important small improvements and not just the big bang !
We need to find the balance which builds from our best past work but also does n’t send a discouraging message that everything has been done before , or if it was that it was necessarily done correctly !
We need to benefit from the wisdom of our elders without being constrained by them .
We ’ve argued for the increased promotion of computational diversity ( http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2003_05/column1) rather than a narrow focus on using the right current industrial platform or language .
OBJECTS NEXT ?
In the OO community there seems to be a concerted search to either find what is “ Beyond Objects ? ” or to argue that “ Objects Are It ! ” .
To their credit OOPSLA ( http://www.oopsla.org/2006/) and ECOOP ( http://www.emn.fr/x-info/ecoop2006/) have been openly searching for new ideas in their calls for papers and workshops .
The OOPSLA Onward !
track deserves special mention in this regard as it provides a platform for new ideas .
The popular research area of AOP is one new next contender which has rapidly emerged from our own community and now has its own successful conference ( http://aosd.net/2005/).
Recently , there have been papers / proposals for Feature , Language , Law , DSL / Domain , and Context Oriented Programming etc .
There is also good work in integrated objects and transactions , unifying objects , info sets and tuples [ 1 ] .
Closely related to this is the interesting work on making relationships found in ER and UML models first class types in a programming language [ 2 ] .
Continued work on Actors [ 3 ] and more recently Chords [ 4 ] seeks to unify concurrency with object orientation .
Object Ownership has always proved a challenging problem especially when VM implementations refuse to allow objects to have an associated owner ; however , considerable progress has been made [ 5 , 6 ] .
There is also a resurgence in research on dynamic languages including prototype based languages and multi-paradigm languages .
Finally , work on using objects to build next generation multi-modal UI toolkits is very interesting [ 7 ] .
All of this work seeks to provide tools or language extensions which allow the OO model to address specific issues and / or broaden the applicability of OO .
While they do n’t promise a New Oriented Programming they provide the critical and difficult research to build better OO languages , tools and systems .
It is clearly a challenge to integrate all of these powerful concepts into a language / platform which is useable by those who are not advanced software professionals .
PEOPLE ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
One of the more exciting changes in our field is the rapid and energetic emergence of Agile Software development initiated by Scrum and XP .
Unlike traditional process artifact centered approaches to development , Agile emphasizes human and business values .
Large , unfortunately unpublished internal studies have concluded that defects and timely delivery of software are most high correlated with the individuals and teams of individuals rather than the programming environments , languages or platforms .
We have for too long focused on the technical dimension of our field without considering the importance of the social aspects and especially the critical need to effectively communicate with our customers and between ourselves .
Even small progress in this area promises huge benefits .
OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE
Open Source has provided the impetus for small global teams of open source project developers , some of whom have never met in person , to collaborate to build software together .
Other developers and users have full view of the source code they create and in many cases the interactions of team members .
Simple Open Source tools such as Wiki , JUnit and Fit have a major impact on allowing teams to build better software .
Eclipse has enabled many to contribute to the open source tooling .
Recently MS and Eclipse have initiated efforts to enable open process definitions which may lead to integration of processes and tools .
The availability of open tooling has allowed customers to innovate in their tools and processes , often accelerating the transition to things like Agile development .
The large open source code base provides a rich set of research data for social researchers as well as software engineers who can now finally look at large programs as they evolve over time .
The combination of sophisticated program analysis , text understanding and simple heuristics promises new tools for helping us understand how we work .
SOFTWARE WITH POLISH
It is well accepted that it takes time to polish a good essay , research paper or a program into something that we believe is correct and readable [ 8 ] .
Modern languages lack publication syntax and IDEs lack a nice way to publish / present the code using multiple fonts and indentations 2 so that it is readable [ 9 ] by others .
We need to make the technical and business case that clean , well - written software is a better investment and that “ send it back , refactor it and make it better ” is a necessity not a luxury .
SAYING MORE WITH LESS – THE NEED FOR A VHSL Despite the great progress in tools and languages there is still far too much stuff that gets in the way .
The latent and accidental complexity of current languages and platforms makes a 4GL of the past look like a dream .
Java and C# are just barely above the machine code of the VM .
VMs have lifted the level of the platform but we are still programming just above them .
There is too much code to be developed and maintained to keep using low - level languages even if they are supported with fancy visual tools and generators .
Even in old functional programming languages such as Lisp and APL all developers knew map reduce as a programming idiom and did n’t need a separate course in design patterns .
Perhaps we should take a tip from our colleagues in hardware design and think about languages which are simple , expressive and allow us to describe major applications in a small number of pages of code .
If electrical engineers can move to HDL and VHDL we should be prepared to move to at least a similar level of abstraction with a VHSL .
We need to move beyond the complexity , limitations and weaknesses of Smalltalk and Lisp but seek a language with at least as simple a syntax and more expressiveness .
We have the benefit of considerable research on advanced type systems which can used to work with the developer as opposed to against him .
Our hardware colleagues can help by using some of those transistors to support robust and efficient dispatch , true sandboxing and type and ownership information for every instance .
Small investments in hardware software co-design can have a huge impact on the robustness and adaptability of software .
