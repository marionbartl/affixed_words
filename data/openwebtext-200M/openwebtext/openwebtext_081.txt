Flaw 1 - Windows ' Interactive Services
Like all Unix distributions , Mac OS X spawns background system processes , called daemons , to handle various tasks .
When a user logs into Mac OS X , a special security context is created for that user .
Any applications that user launches are started under that user 's credentials .
Background processes can respond to requests from user - level applications , but they can not initiate any contact with the user , nor present any graphical interface , because they operate in a separate security context .
This is an important security measure that is missing in Windows , which allows for " interactive services . "
Allowing system processes running as root ( " Services running as LocalSystem " in Windows - speak ) to present a graphic UI to a logged in user ( " become interactive with the desktop " ) is , to quote an MSDN blogger , a " spectacularly bad idea that should never have been added to the system . "
Window 's casual mix of security contexts makes it easy for malicious code to jump from the user 's limited access realm into the root context , making it easy for a basic exploit to take over the entire machine .
Exploiting this Windows - only flaw is called a Shatter Attack .
Three years ago , Microsoft replied to the threat of Shatter Attacks by stating that it was a known problem , and only offering that the inherently insecure and commonly used feature should n't be used ( while citing earlier documentation that explained how to use it ) ; that it only affected computers where a user could log in , such as a terminal server , or a workstation , or a server allowing logins ( boggle ! ) ; and that , while a Shatter Attack could own your Terminal Server , it could n't directly own the network .
Of course , there are other security flaws to use once an exploit owns a trusted server .
Microsoft has decided to remove interactive services from Windows Vista ( five years after the discovery became widely publicized ) , but this will break all the Windows services that currently use this insecure mechanism .
As a side note , Mac OS X's security edge over Windows in this example was n't a product of hindsight ;
Apple just employed reasonable , known security principles .
Shatter Attacks were exposed in 2002 , the timeframe of Jaguar , after Apple had completed most of Mac OS X's security policy .

The defense against this heinous
Opinion
Learning to love Big Brother / George W. Bush channels George Orwell
Here 's a question for constitutional scholars :
Can a sitting president be charged with plagiarism ?
As President Bush wages his war against terrorism and moves to create a huge homeland security apparatus , he appears to be borrowing heavily , if not ripping off ideas outright , from George Orwell .
The work in question is " 1984 , " the prophetic novel about a government that controls the masses by spreading propaganda , cracking down on subversive thought and altering history to suit its needs .
It was intended to be read as a warning about the evils of totalitarianism -- not a how - to manual .
Granted , we 're a long way from resembling the kind of authoritarian state Orwell depicted , but some of the similarities are starting to get a bit eerie .
PERMANENT WAR
In " 1984 , " the state remained perpetually at war against a vague and ever - changing enemy .
The war took place largely in the abstract , but it served as a convenient vehicle to fuel hatred , nurture fear and justify the regime 's autocratic practices .
Bush 's war against terrorism has become almost as amorphous .
Although we are told the president 's resolve is steady and the mission clear , we seem to know less and less about the enemy we are fighting .
What began as a war against Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda quickly morphed into a war against Afghanistan , followed by dire warnings about an " Axis of Evil , " the targeting of terrorists in some 50 to 60 countries , and now the beginnings of a major campaign against Iraq .
Exactly what will constitute success in this war remains unclear , but the one thing the Bush administration has made certain is that the war will continue " indefinitely . "
Serving as the propaganda arm of the ruling party in " 1984 , " the Ministry of Truth not only spread lies to suit its strategic goals , but constantly rewrote and falsified history .
It is a practice that has become increasingly commonplace in the Bush White House , where presidential transcripts are routinely sanitized to remove the president 's gaffes , accounts of intelligence warnings prior to Sept. 11 get spottier with each retelling , and the facts surrounding Bush 's past financial dealings are subject to continual revision .
The Bush administration has been surprisingly up front about its intentions of propagating falsehoods .
In February , for example , the Pentagon announced a plan to create an Office of Strategic Influence to provide false news and information abroad to help manipulate public opinion and further its military objectives .
Following a public outcry , the Pentagon said it would close the office -- news that would have sounded more convincing had it not come from a place that just announced it was planning to spread misinformation .
INFALLIBLE LEADER
An omnipresent and all - powerful leader , Big Brother commanded the total , unquestioning support of the people .
He was both adored and feared , and no one dared speak out against him , lest they be met by the wrath of the state .
President Bush may not be as menacing a figure , but he has hardly concealed his desire for greater powers .
Never mind that he has mentioned -- on no fewer than three occasions -- how much easier things would be if he were dictator .
By abandoning many of the checks and balances established in the Constitution to keep any one branch of government from becoming too powerful , Bush has already achieved the greatest expansion of executive powers since Nixon .
His approval ratings remain remarkably high , and his minions have worked hard to cultivate an image of infallibility .
Nowhere was that more apparent than during a recent commencement address Bush gave at Ohio State , where students were threatened with arrest and expulsion if they protested the speech .
They were ordered to give him a " thunderous ovation , " and they did .
BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING
The ever - watchful eye of Big Brother kept constant tabs on the citizens of Orwell 's totalitarian state , using two - way telescreens to monitor people 's every move while simultaneously broadcasting party propaganda .
While that technology may not have arrived yet , public video surveillance has become all the rage in law enforcement , with cameras being deployed everywhere from sporting events to public beaches .
The Bush administration has also announced plans to recruit millions of Americans to form a corps of citizen spies who will serve as " extra eyes and ears for law enforcement , " reporting any suspicious activity as part of a program dubbed Operation TIPS --
Terrorism Information and Prevention System .
And thanks to the hastily passed USA Patriot Act , the Justice Department has sweeping new powers to monitor phone conversations , Internet usage , business transactions and library reading records .
Best of all , law enforcement need not be burdened any longer with such inconveniences as probable cause .
THOUGHT POLICE
Charged with eradicating dissent and ferreting out resistance , the ever - present Thought Police described in " 1984 " carefully monitored all unorthodox or potentially subversive thoughts .
The Bush administration is not prosecuting thought crime yet , but members have been quick to question the patriotism of anyone who dares criticize their handling of the war on terrorism or homeland defense .
Take , for example , the way Attorney General John Ashcroft answered critics of his anti-terrorism measures , saying that opponents of the administration " only aid terrorists " and " give ammunition to America 's enemies . "
Even more ominous was the stern warning White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer sent to Americans after Bill Maher , host of the now defunct " Politically Incorrect , " called past U.S. military actions " cowardly . "
Said Fleischer , " There are reminders to all Americans that they need to watch what they say , watch what they do , and this is not a time for remarks like that ; there never is . "
What would it take to turn America into the kind of society that Orwell warned about , a society that envisions war as peace , freedom as slavery and ignorance as strength ?
Would it happen overnight , or would it involve a gradual erosion of freedoms with the people 's consent ?
Because we are a nation at war -- as we are constantly reminded -- most Americans say they are willing to sacrifice many of our freedoms in return for the promise of greater security .
We have been asked to put our blind faith in government and most of us have done so with patriotic fervor .
But when the government abuses that trust and begins to stamp out the freedom of dissent that is the hallmark of a democratic society , can there be any turning back ?
So powerful was the state 's control over people 's minds in " 1984 " that , eventually , everyone came to love Big Brother .
Perhaps in time we all will , too .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) --
A dramatic pay gap emerges between women and men in America the year after they graduate from college and widens over the ensuing decade , according to research released on Monday .
One year out of college , women working full time earn 80 percent of what men earn , according to the study by the American Association of University Women Educational Foundation , based in Washington D.C .
Quiz
Take the quiz
Do you deserve a raise ?
Before asking , know your strengths and weaknesses .
1 . If you left the company , how easy or hard would it be for the company to replace you ?
Easy Hard
This quiz is adapted from Are You Paid What You 're Worth ? , by Michael O'Malley ( Broadway Books , $ 15 ) .
Ten years later , women earn 69 percent as much as men earn , it said .
Even as the study accounted for such factors as the number of hours worked , occupations or parenthood , the gap persisted , researchers said .
" If a woman and a man make the same choices , will they receive the same pay ? " the study asked .
" The answer is no .
" These unexplained gaps are evidence of discrimination , which remains a serious problem for women in the work force . "
Specifically , about one - quarter of the pay gap is attributable to gender - 5 percent one year after graduation and 12 percent 10 years after graduation , it said .
One year out of college , men and women should arguably be the least likely to show a gender pay gap , the study said , since neither tend to be parents yet and they enter the work force without significant experience .
" It surprised me that it was already apparent one year out of college , and that it widens over the first 10 years , " Catherine Hill , AAUW director of research , told Reuters .
The choice of fields of concentration in college was a significant factor found to make a difference in pay , the study found .
Female students tended to study areas with lower pay , such as education , health and psychology , while male students dominated higher - paying fields such as engineering , mathematics and physical sciences , it said .
Even so , one year after graduation , a pay gap turned up between women and men who studied the same fields .
In education , women earn 95 percent as much as their male colleagues earn , while in math , women earn 76 percent as much as men earn , the study showed .
While in college , the study showed , women outperformed men academically , and their grade point averages were higher in every college major .
Parenthood affected men and women in vividly different ways .
The study showed mothers more likely than fathers , or other women , to work part time or take leaves .
Among women who graduated from college in 1992 - 93 , more than one - fifth of mothers were out of the work force a decade later , and another 17 percent were working part time , it said .
In the same class , less than 2 percent of fathers were out of the work force in 2003 , and less than 2 percent were working part time , it said .
The study , entitled " Behind the Pay Gap , " used data from the U.S. Department of Education .
It analyzed some 9,000 college graduates from 1992 - 93 and more than 10,000 from 1999 - 2000 .

Abstract
Phooey is a functional UI library for Haskell .
Or it 's two of them , as it provides a Monad interface and an Applicative interface .
The simplicity of Phooey 's implementation is due to its use of Reactive for applicative , data - driven computation .
( Before version 2.0 , Phooey used the DataDriven library . )
Besides this wiki page , here are more ways to find out about Phooey :
Read the Haddock docs ( with source code , additional examples , and Comment / Talk links ) .
Get the code repository : darcs get http://conal.net/repos/phooey .
The package can be installed from Hackage , using cabal - install :
cabal install phooey
Phooey is also used in GuiTV , a library for composable interfaces and " tangible values " .
Since Reactive is currently broken ( as of February 2010 ) , Phooey is also broken .
Introduction
GUIs are usually programmed in an unnatural style , in that implementation dependencies are inverted , relative to logical dependencies .
This reversal results directly from the push ( data - driven ) orientation of most GUI libraries .
While outputs depend on inputs from a user and semantic point of view , the push style imposes an implementation dependence of inputs on outputs .
A second drawback of the push style is that it is imperative rather than declarative .
A GUI program describes actions to update a model and view in reaction to user input .
In contrast to the how - to - update style of an imperative program , a functional GUI program would express what - it - is of a model in terms of the inputs and of the view in terms of the model .
The questions of push - vs - pull and imperative - vs - declarative are related .
While an imperative GUI program could certainly be written to pull ( poll ) values from input to model and model to view , thus eliminating the dependency inversion , I do n't know how a declarative program could be written in the inverted - dependency style .
( Do you ? ) .
A important reason for using push rather than pull in a GUI implementation is that push is typically much more efficient .
A simple pull implementation would either waste time recomputing an unchanging model and view ( pegging your CPU for no benefit ) , or deal with the complexity of avoiding that recomputation .
The push style computes only when inputs change .
( Continuous change , i.e. animation , negates this advantage of push . )
Phooey ( " Phunctional ooser ynterfaces " ) adopts the declarative style , in which outputs are expressed in terms of inputs .
Under the hood , however , the implementation is push - based ( data - driven ) .
Phooey uses the Reactive library to perform the dependency inversion invisibly , so that programmers may express GUIs simply and declaratively while still getting an efficient implementation .
Phooey came out of Pajama and Eros. Pajama is a re-implementation of the Pan language and compiler for function synthesis of interactive , continuous , infinite images .
Pan and Pajama use a monadic style for specifying GUIs and are able to do so because they use the implementation trick of Compiling Embedded Languages , in which one manipulates expressions rather than values .
( This trick is mostly transparent , but the illusion shows through in places . )
One example , two interfaces
As an example , below is a simple shopping list GUI .
The total displayed at the bottom of the window always shows the sum of the values of the apples and bananas input sliders .
When a user changes the inputs , the output updates accordingly .
Phooey presents two styles of functional GUI interfaces , structured as a monad and as an applicative functor .
( I have removed the original arrow interface . )
Below you can see the code for the shopping list example in each of these styles .
The examples below are all found under src / Examples / in the phooey distribution , in the modules Monad.hs , and Applicative .hs .
In each case , the example is run by loading the corresponding example module into ghci and typing runUI ui1 .
Monad
Here is a definition for the GUI shown above , formulated in terms of Phooey 's monadic interface .
See the monad interface and its source code .
ui1 :: UI ( ) ui1 = title " Shopping List " $ do a <- title " apples " $ islider ( 0 , 10 ) 3 b <- title " bananas " $ islider ( 0 , 10 ) 7 title " total " $ showDisplay ( lift A2 ( + ) a b )
The relevant library declarations :
-- Input widget type ( with initial value ) type IWidget a = a -> UI ( Source a ) --
Output widget type type OWidget a = Source a -> UI ( ) islider :: ( Int , Int ) ->
IWidget Int showDisplay :: Show a =>
OWidget a title :: String -> UI a -> UI a
The Source type is a ( data - driven ) source of time - varying values .
( Source is a synonym for Reactive .)
By using Source Int instead of Int for the type of a and b above , we do not have to rebuild the GUI every time an input value changes .
The down side of using source types is seen in the showDisplay line above , which requires lifting .
We could partially hide the lifting behind overloadings of Num and other classes ( as in Fran , Pan , and other systems ) .
Some methods , however , do not not have sufficiently flexible types ( e.g. , ( == ) ) , and the illusion becomes awkward .
The Arrow and Applicative interfaces hide the source types .
Before we move on to other interface styles , let 's look at some refactorings .
First pull out the slider minus initial value :
sl0 :: IWidget Int sl0 = islider ( 0 , 10 )
Then the titled widgets :
apples , bananas :: UI ( Source Int ) apples = title " apples " $ sl0 3 bananas = title " bananas " $ sl0 7 total :: Num a =>
OWidget a total = title " total " .
showDisplay
And use them :
ui1x :: UI ( ) ui1 x = title " Shopping List " $ do a <- apples b <- bananas total ( lift A2 ( + ) a b )
We can go point - free by using lift M2 and ( >>= ) :
-- Sum UIs infixl 6 .+. ( .+. ) :: Num a => UIS a -> UIS a -> UIS a ( .+. ) = liftA2 ( lift A2 ( + ) ) fruit :: UI ( Source Int ) fruit = apples .+. bananas ui1y :: UI ( ) ui1y = title " Shopping List " $ fruit >>= total
Applicative Functor
Applicative functors ( AFs ) provide still another approach to separating static and dynamic information .
Here is our example , showing just the changes relative to the monadic version .
( See the Applicative interface doc and its source code . )
ui1 :: UI ( IO ( ) ) ui1 = title " Shopping List " $ fruit <**> total fruit :: UI Int fruit = lift A2 ( + ) apples bananas total :: Num a =>
OWidget a total = title " total " showDisplay
I chose reversed AF application ( <**>) rather than ( <*>) so the fruit ( argument ) would be displayed above the total ( function ) .
The UI - building functions again have the same types as before , relative to these new definitions :
type IWidget a = a -> UI a type OWidget a = UI ( a -> IO ( ) )
Notes :
Output widgets are function - valued UI .
fruit has a simpler definition , requiring only one lifting instead of two .
has a simpler definition , requiring only one lifting instead of two .
total is subtly different , because output widgets are now function - valued .
is subtly different , because output widgets are now .
ui1 uses the reverse application operator ( <**> ) .
This reversal causes the function to appear after ( below ) the argument .

This reversal causes the function to appear after ( below ) the argument .
ui1 is an IO - valued UI .
The applicative UI interface ( Graphics .
UI .
Phooey .
Applicative ) is implemented as a very simple layer on top of the monadic interface , using type composition ( from TypeCompose ) :
type UI = M . UI :.
Source
Thanks to properties of O , this definition suffices to make UI an AF .
Layout
By default , UI layout follows the order of the specification , with earlier - specified components above later - specified ones .
This layout may be overridden by explicit layout functions .
For instance , the following definitions form variations of ui1 laid out from bottom to top and from left to right .
GUIs & code :
uiB1 = fromBottom ui1 uiL1 = fromLeft ui1
We can also lay out a sub-assembly , as in ui3 below
ui3 = fromBottom $ title " Shopping List " $ fromRight fruit >>= total
Event Examples
The shopping examples above demonstrate the simple case of outputs ( total ) as functions of varying inputs ( apples and bananas ) .
Events were hidden inside the implementation of reactive values .
This section shows two classic functional GUI examples involving a visible notion of events .
Counter
Here is simple counter , which increments or decrements when the " up " or " down " button is pressed .
The example is from " Structuring Graphical Paradigms in TkGofer "
The first piece in making this counter is a button , having a specified value and a label .
The button GUI 's value is an event rather than a source :
smallButton :: a -> String -> UI ( Event a )
To make the up / down counter , we 'll want two such buttons , labeled " up " and " down " .
But with what values ?
The buttons wo n't know what the counter value is , but they will know how to change the value , so the events will be function - valued .
The two events resulting from the two buttons are then merged into a single function - valued event via mappend .
( If you 're curious about events at this point , take a detour and read about them . )
The pair of buttons and combined event could be written as follows :
upDown :: Num a => UIE ( a -> a ) upDown = do up <- smallButton ( + 1 ) " up " down <- smallButton ( subtract 1 ) " down " return ( up ` mappend ` down )
If you 've been hanging around with monad hipsters , you 'll know that we can write this definition more simply :
upDown = lift M2 mappend ( smallButton ( + 1 ) " up " ) ( smallButton ( subtract 1 ) " down " )
Personally , I 'm on an Applicative kick lately , so I prefer lift A2 in place of lift M2 .
Still more sleekly , let 's hide the lift M2 ( or lift A2 ) by using the Monoid ( UI o ) instance , which holds whenever Monoid o .
upDown = smallButton ( + 1 ) " up " ` mappend ` smallButton ( subtract 1 ) " down "
To finish the counter , use the accumR function , which makes a source from an initial value and an function - valued event .
The source begins as the initial value and grows by applying the functions generated by the event .
accumR :: a -> UI ( Event ( a -> a ) ) ->
UI ( Source a ) counter :: UI ( ) counter = title " Counter " $ fromLeft $ do e <- upDown showDisplay ( 0 ` accumR ` e )
Calculator
The second event example is a calculator , as taken from " Lightweight GUIs for Functional Programming " .
The basic structure of this example is just like the previous one .
Each key has a function - valued event , and the keys are combined ( visually and semantically ) using mappend .
First a single key .
For variety , we 'll postpone interpreting the key 's event as a function .
key :: Char -> UIE
Char key c = button ' c [ c ]
We 'll combine keys with the help of a friend of concatMap :
mconcatMap :: Monoid b => ( a -> b ) -> [ a ] -> b mconcatMap f = mconcat .
map f
With this helper , it 's especially easy to turn several keys into a row and several rows into a keyboard .
row :: [ Char ] ->
UIE Char row = fromLeft .
mconcatMap key rows :: [ [ Char ] ] ->
UIE
Char rows = fromTop .
mconcatMap row calcKeys :: UIE Char calcKeys = rows [ " 123 + " , " 456 - " , " 789 * " , " C0= / " ]
Next , let 's turn calcKeys 's character - valued event into a function - valued event .
While the state of the counter was a single number , the calculator state is a little more complicated .
It consists of a number being formed and a continuation .
type CState = ( Int , Int ->
Int ) startCS :: CState startCS = ( 0 , id )
Keyboard characters have interpretations as state transitions .
cmd :: Char -> CState -> CState cmd ' C ' _ = startCS cmd ' =' ( d , k ) = ( k d , const ( k d ) ) cmd c ( d , k ) | is Digit c = ( 10 * d + ord c - ord ' 0 ' , k ) | otherwise = ( 0 , op c ( k d ) ) op :: Char -> Int -> Int ->
Int op c = fromJust ( lookup c ops ) where ops :: [( Char , Binop Int ) ] ops = [ ( '+' ,( + ) ) , ( '-' ,( - ) ) , ( '*' ,( * ) ) , ( '/' , div ) ]
To compute the ( reactive ) value , from a key - generating event , accumulate transitions , starting with the initial state , and extract the value .
compCalc :: Event Char ->
Source Int compCalc key = fmap fst ( startCS ` accumR ` fmap cmd key )
Show the result :
showCalc :: Event Char -> UI ( ) showCalc = title " result " .
showDisplay .
compCalc
The whole calculator then snaps together :
calc :: UI ( ) calc = title " Calculator " $ calcKeys >>= showCalc
Portability
Phooey is built on wxHaskell .
Quoting from the wxHaskell home page ,
wxHaskell is therefore built on top of wxWidgets -- a comprehensive C++ library that is portable across all major GUI platforms ; including GTK , Windows , X11 , and MacOS X .
So I expect that Phooey runs on all of these platforms .
That said , I have only tried Phooey on Windows .
Please give it a try and leave a message on the talk page .
Known problems
Recursive examples do n't work ( consumes memory ) in the Arrow or Applicative interface .

Imagine , if you will , that one by one your friends and family ⁠— the people closest to you⁠ — are being removed and replaced with exact duplicates .
Although they are identical in appearance and manner , you are certain that these people are not your loved ones .
They are impostors .
While most people would become deeply paranoid in such a scenario , there are some individuals who experience such things every day without fear … and just wonder , “ why ? ” Such is the life of people stricken with Capgras ’ Syndrome .
A person with Capgras ’ Syndrome suffers from the delusion that one or more of their close friends or family members have been replaced with exact duplicates , and they cannot be shaken from this belief in spite of an otherwise clean bill of mental health .
In some instances , the person believes that they themselves are , in whole or in part , a duplicate .
Unlike the paranoia expected from such a condition , there is never a motive assigned for the appearance of the duplicates – the patients do not believe someone is “ out to get them , ” but they are at a loss for an explanation why anyone would want to replace their loved ones .
This odd misperception is named after the French psychiatrist Jean Marie Joseph Capgras , who described the case of a Madame M. in 1923 .
The woman insisted that identical - looking persons had taken the place of her family .
Over time her delusion expanded to include neighbors , friends and acquaintances .
But Madame M. never bothered to get to know these impostors because it was her belief that each one regularly left to make room for the next double .
In all , she eventually claimed to have had more than eighty husbands .
People suffering from Capgras ’ Syndrome can sometimes even doubt their own identity after seeing their reflection in a mirror .
One man pinched himself on the arm after seeing his reflection at the doctor ’s office , and wondered aloud whether he and the man in the reflection were the same person .
There was also a woman who flew into a jealous rage every time she caught sight of her own reflection , believing this “ other woman ” was trying to lure her husband away from her .
Her husband eventually covered every reflective surface in the house in an effort to keep her from hurting herself .
Oddly enough , she had no problem recognizing herself in the mirror of her makeup compact , but anything larger resulted in an assault on the imaginary impostor .
Her doctor tried a novel solution : he gathered a number of mirrors of varying sizes , and had the woman view herself in each one .
He started with the smallest and gradually moved to the next larger as soon as she recognized herself .
Ultimately she was able to see herself in a full - length mirror , and she was cured from then on .
In some instances , individuals with the Capgras delusion see duplicate objects rather than duplicate people .
One doctor reported a patient who believed that his poodle had been replaced with an identical dog , and another reported a patient who believed that during the night his running shoes and many other personal possessions were being replaced .
Capgras ’ delusion always centers around just one of the subject ’s senses .
The most common is the sense of sight ; for example , one person readily recognized his wife on the phone when speaking to her , yet when she arrived in the flesh he thought the impostor was actually his sister - in - law .
Blind people have also been diagnosed with the disorder , and they believe that the voices of certain loved ones are actually coming from duplicates .
While the causes of Capgras ’ syndrome are not specifically known , there is no shortage of theories .
It has been shown that many people with the syndrome have brain lesions in the right temporal lobe from traumatic injuries , epilepsy , and other causes , yet there are also significant numbers of patients with no such damage in evidence .
Also , there is a somewhat higher incidence of schizophrenia among people with Capgras , and in New Zealand there is a markedly higher incidence of the disorder among the Maori people than in the general population .
Some earlier researchers attempted to draw connections to Prosopagnosia , a condition which prevents some people from being able to recognize faces .
By measuring a person ’s galvanic skin response⁠ — the amount of electrical resistance in the skin⁠ — scientists can detect when an individual is experiencing emotions .
Patients with Prosopagnosia show an emotional response to familiar faces , though they exhibit no conscious recognition .
With a Capgras patient there is no such reaction .
Though no emotional connection is present when shown a picture of their father , the patient will remark on the striking resemblance .
This test also rules out mental illness as a definitive cause , since the emotional center of the brain would subconsciously react even with impaired perceptions .
Another proposed cause involves some form of damage or impairment in two lobes of the brain :
One site of damage affecting the emotional connections with respect to people ’s faces , and the other affecting the brain ’s consistency - checking abilities .
In at least one case , doctors have successfully cured Capgras ’ Syndrome by suspending a prescription of diazepam , yet in other cases symptoms have disappeared after administering anti-psychotic medication .
To date , no single treatment has been found to be consistently effective , and so far there is no single theory that can explain all the reported cases of Capgras ’ Syndrome .
We do know , however , that the human mind uses many interlocking cognitive tricks to fill in the gaps of our observations , essentially building a simulation which allows us to interact with our world and society .
When just one or two of those links go awry , the true complexity of that simulation is revealed by the fascinating problems that arise .
WASHINGTON , Oct. 30 - With the announcement of a new Supreme Court nominee expected as early as Monday , Senator Harry Reid of Nevada , the Democratic leader , warned President Bush on Sunday not to pick one of the candidates said to be on the president 's short list , Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr .
" I think it would create a lot of problems , " Mr. Reid said on " Late Edition " on CNN .
Republicans close to the selection process said over the weekend that as Mr. Bush neared a final decision , Judge Alito , of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit , remained a leading candidate , along with Judge J. Michael Luttig of the Fourth Circuit , Judge Alice M. Batchelder of the Sixth Circuit , and Judge Priscilla R. Owen of the Fifth Circuit .
One outside adviser to the White House said on Sunday that a surprise was still possible .
But prominent conservatives said all four have the kind of clear record and judicial credentials they are hoping for in a Supreme Court nominee , and liberal groups are girding for battle to oppose them .
Mr. Reid had already said he would object to the selection of Judge Luttig or Judge Owen .
And on Sunday , he did not rule out the possibility that Democrats would try to block a nominee by a filibuster or refusing to close debate and vote .
" We are going to do everything we can " to see that the president names " somebody that 's really good , " Mr. Reid said .
These are images from the Siemens 64 slice CT scanner .
It 's the worldâ€™s first CT scanner able to take 192 images per second .
It 's really a breakthrough in medical technology .
It will render extremely detailed 4d models of the human body in mere seconds .

Apple Pays Creative $ 100 Million To Settle Patent Suit -- Creative uses its patent on " Automatic hierarchical categorization of music by metadata " ( PDF copy ; FPL version ) to force its way into doing business with Apple and to extort $ 100 M from them .
The first and broadest claim of this brilliant innovation gives Creative the exclusive rights to make , use , or sell the following " method " ( I 've broken out the actual five steps covered by the method in bullet points : the first part is a mere preamble and merely defines terms and sets the context for the actual steps ; any competitor that has a product that engages in all five of these steps , or their " equivalent " ( even if the competitor uses additional steps too ) is " infringing " this claim :
A method of selecting at least one track from a plurality of tracks stored in a computer - readable medium of a portable media player configured to present sequentially a first , second , and third display screen on the display of the media player , the plurality of tracks accessed according to a hierarchy , the hierarchy having a plurality of categories , subcategories , and items respectively in a first , second , and third level of the hierarchy , the method comprising : selecting a category in the first display screen of the portable media player ;
displaying the subcategories belonging to the selected category in a listing presented in the second display screen ;
selecting a subcategory in the second display screen ;
displaying the items belonging to the selected subcategory in a listing presented in the third display screen ; and

Wow , this case is a perfect illustration of the idea that patents are just such a great source of innovation and wealth .
I 'm sure , without Creative 's heroic innovation and genius engineers , no one would have ever figured out that it would be useful to have " an interface that lets users navigate through a tree of expanding options , such as selecting an artist , then a particular album by that artist , then a specific song from that album " .
Without Creative 's brilliant creativity -- which we would not have been blessed with but for the incentives of reaping $ 100 M in go - away money from the big guy on the block -- society would forever be doomed to have MP3 players that only allow you to choose from thousands of songs alphabetically .
Think how much time and effort we are all spared now , due to this blockbuster innovation by Creative
.
But wait a sec .
For Creative to win their patent suit against Apple , they do n't even have to prove Apple got the idea from Creative 's patent .
Even if Apple came up with the idea independently -- even if the idea is , shall we say , fairly obvious -- Creative could still win .
Hmm .
User - defined data types , pattern - matching , and recursion are ubiquitous features of Haskell programs .
Sometimes a function is called with arguments that are statically known to already be in constructor form , so that the work of pattern - matching is wasted .
Even worse , the argument is sometimes freshly - allocated , only to be immediately decomposed by the function .
In this paper we describe a simple , modular transformation that specialises recursive functions according to their argument “ shapes ” .
We show that such a transformation has a simple , modular implementation , and that it can be extremely effective in practice , eliminating both pattern - matching and heap allocation .
We describe our implementation of this constructor specialisation transformation in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler , and give measurements of its effectiveness .

Cannon retrieval may not be rocket science , but a group of intrepid , cross-country - trekking Caltech students has learned it is n’t much easier .
On Monday , two dozen of the Pasadena - based scholars used more brawn than brains here to recover a 111 - year - old cannon that Massachusetts Institute of Technology pranksters had swiped from Caltech last month .
Shortly after 7 a.m. , in a chill coming off the Charles River , Caltech junior Scott Jordan exhorted his schoolmates to roll the 3 - ton Fleming Cannon off a cobbled MIT courtyard , where it had rested trophy - like since Thursday .
“ Back where it belongs ! ” Jordan yelled .

With that , the shivering Caltech students , most dressed in the thin red jerseys of the school ’s Fleming House , broke out ropes and a handmade dolly to push and pull the wooden - wheeled cannon toward a waiting flatbed truck .
Caltech ’s low - tech reclamation of the weapon capped four frantic days of bicoastal strategizing , desperate fundraising and last - minute airline bookings .
The latest skirmish in the two schools ’ recent prank war also provided some practical life experience to the budding scientists and engineers .
They found out that 12 hours is not always enough time to make a sufficient number of trips to Home Depot , and that keeping a Caltech secret from MIT might be impossible because of the traffic in graduate students between the campuses .

Students at Fleming House , a Caltech residence hall , began scheming to get the cannon back as soon as they heard that MIT had its mitts on it .
The cannon disappeared after a crew of “ movers ” showed up at Caltech on March 28 , presented a phony work order to unsuspecting security guards , and carted it off -- barrel , carriage and tongue .
The Caltech students assumed that Harvey Mudd College jokesters had taken the cannon , in a reprise of a 1986 stunt .
But when it did n’t turn up at Harvey Mudd in Claremont , the Flems , as they call themselves , began to wonder if the cannon had actually been stolen .
The loss would have been devastating .
The cannon is fired for Caltech commencements , “ ditch days ” and other special occasions .

Then it surfaced at MIT ’s McDermott Court , in front of the towering Green Building , the barrel adorned with a giant mock - up of the school ’s class ring , and the display marked by a plaque proclaiming that the cannon had been shipped back east by the “ Howe & Ser Moving Company . ”
It was payback for multiple pranks last year .
Caltech students had handed out to incoming MIT freshmen hundreds of T - shirts that said “ MIT ” on the front -- and on the back , " ... because not everyone can go to Caltech . ”
The Caltech squad also changed an MIT sign to read “ The Other Institute of Technology , ” and rigged a laser to spell out “ Caltech ” on the Green Building .
But the cannon hijacking took matters to a new level , and the Flems resolved to strike back with pride - restoring razzle - dazzle .

At a lunch meeting Friday , they embraced the expensive , tricky but sure - to - be - satisfying idea of plucking the cannon from Massachusetts territory with a helicopter , perhaps swooping down in the moonlight .
They convened a larger meeting that night at the campus home of Tom Mannion , Caltech ’s assistant vice president for student life .
Gathered around bowls of M&M ; 's , they discussed the looming difficulties of the operation and complained that MIT had crossed the line by taking the cannon .
Because of its age and fragile state , they declared it “ non-prankable . ”
Mostly , the plotters wanted to grab back the cannon before MIT could return it .
That would be true dishonor .
“ The helicopter company has seen the site , and it is not a problem , ” said Jeff Cox , a graduate who was advising the students .
Advertisement
But as it happened , Federal Aviation Administration rules would have required the Flems to arrange for street closures and partial evacuation of buildings along the cannon - laden helicopter ’s route .
The students queried one another about contacts at the FAA , or alumni who might have “ clout ” with the agency .
Plan B arose :
They would truck the cannon away while the MITers slumbered .
For good measure , they would construct scaffolding from which to unfurl a huge Fleming flag , replace the cannon with a toy one and cover the “ Howe & Ser ” plaque with a specially machined one bearing the letter F .
But money was a factor .
The students had about $ 8,000 in their prank fund , earned from the sale of the MIT T - shirts .
They would need much more , including maybe $ 9,000 to ship the cannon home .
They began e-mailing alumni , some of whom had already volunteered to contribute .
Advertisement
Meanwhile , they set up a “ situation room ” in a campus trailer , complete with maps and satellite photos , and a list of the students ’ credit card limits .
By Saturday afternoon , the first contingent of cannon rescuers was airborne .
“ It is a little nuts , ” Rob Hunter said during his Sunday flight to Boston .
Traveling with him was Britton Boras , who explained why they go to such lengths in the prankster battles .
“ We work so hard in school that our fun is so precious to us , ” he said .
That ’s why “ we work hard at that too . ”

The students rendezvoused with Caltech alumni in the Boston area .
“ I ’m a Flem for life , ” said Vicki Loewer , an MIT graduate student who had 10 or more of the Caltech brigade bivouacked in her apartment .
On Sunday night , sawdust covered the apartment ’s floor , from the dolly that would be used to support the cannon ’s tongue .
By now , the students were sleep - deprived .
They abandoned the notion to build scaffolding for the Fleming flag .
“ We only had 12 hours , ” Jordan said .
The clock worked against them in other ways .
They were determined to raid McDermott Court around 4 a.m. and parade the cannon around a bit before loading it on the flatbed .
But they decided to quietly alert MIT ’s campus police about their intentions an hour beforehand .
It may have been a tactical error .
The police wanted to see “ proof of ownership ” for the cannon , and no one had a pink slip .
Advertisement
“ Everyone is livid , ” Hunter said as the hour passed 4 a.m .
Worse , secrecy had been compromised , and a crowd of MITers began to descend on the cannon .
They fixed a couple of portable spotlights on their prize and fired up a barbecue to taunt Caltech “ scouts ” lurking in nearby buildings .
The now - exhausted Caltechers were left to conduct their mission in broad daylight .
Advertisement
As the amused MITers watched , they covered the wheels with strips of vinyl siding to protect their delicate bands , took a bolt cutter to a chain locking the spokes and jacked the tongue onto the dolly .
“ I really like the rivalry , ” said MIT freshman Jon Spaulding .
“ I ’m looking forward to the future and what new pranks come up . ”
Shoulder to iron and rope in hand , the Caltech students made inching progress to the flatbed parked nearby .
The toy cannon was left in the real one ’s place , under a glass vase , next to the F plaque .
By the time the students reached the truck , the vinyl had peeled off the wheels .
When it was done , the Caltech students gave a good - natured cheer to the locals : “ MIT , rah rah rah ... “

But revenge would be coming , said Jordan , the Fleming president , and it would be much more elaborate than ropes and dollies .
“ We ’ll top this by miles , ” he said .
On November 23 , 2004 , Rob Pardo and his team at Blizzard Entertainment wrapped up four years of development on World of Warcraft .
It quickly became the most popular massively multi-player online game ever , with more than 6 million subscribers each paying up to $ 15 a month to access its fantastic realms .
( At the peak of its popularity , EverQuest had only about half a million subs . )
I started playing a year ago and have become custodian of We Know , a guild of about 250 people worldwide : medics , CEOs , bartenders , mothers , soldiers , students .
We assemble in - game to mount epic six - hour raids that require some members to wake at 4 am and others to stay up all night .
Outside the game , we stay in touch using online forums , a wiki , blogs , and a mailing list – plus a group voice chat , which I ’ve connected to my home stereo so I can hear the guild ’s banter while I ’m cooking dinner .
I have never been this addicted to anything before .
My other hobbies are gone .
My daily blogging regimen has taken a hit .
And my social life revolves more and more around friends in the game .
MMORPGs are not new – I played one of the first through the Essex University computer network in the early 1980s .
Back then , everything was text , and MMORPGs were a nerdy subculture of the then - minuscule online world .
But Blizzard synthesized the accomplishments of all past role - playing games and added the rich gameplay and narratives of its previous Warcraft games .
There are four basic draws in any MMORPG : the ability to socialize , an achievement system that gives players an incentive to improve , complex and satisfying strategy that makes combat fun , and an underlying narrative that players want to learn more about .
Pardo ’s group nailed all of these .
Blizzard also updates the game continuously , adding features and addressing user requests .
Later this year , an expansion will add new zones and 10 more experience levels – particularly great for players like me who have maxed out at level 60 .
Pardo ’s team also deserves credit for creating a system that allows players themselves to customize their interfaces and code modifications to improve their WoW experience .
The quality and the popularity of World of Warcraft has propelled MMORPGs from a subculture into the mainstream ; some call it the new golf .
But it ’s more than that : World of Warcraft is millions of people with diverse backgrounds collaborating , socializing , and learning while having fun .
What we ’re experiencing with this game is similar to the “ adhocracy ” of many successful open source software projects .
It represents the future of real - time collaborative teams and leadership in an always - on , diversity - intensive , real - time environment .
World of Warcraft is a glimpse into our future .

Now that the Scooter Libby trial is over , I think it might be time to reflect upon what the impact of the proceedings have had and will have in the future , assuming that there is indeed a future for America .
As most of you know , the Real Deal began as a venture covering the outing of a covert CIA operative , Valerie Plame .
This was an event that I incorrectly thought would lead to the downfall of Booshco .
I fully expected to cover that event , have a few people look at it and then have the Real Deal disappear forever .
As we now know , that is not exactly how it worked out .
So , let ’s do it .
Libby trial over ?
What is wrong with you , Cyclone ?
The jury is just getting the case today and you say it ’s over ?
Well , yes , I do say it is over .
Later I will tell you what I believe will happen after the jury completes its deliberations .
But first , let ’s review what occurred during the trial , and perhaps more importantly , what did not occur .
I do not intend to re-hash what every witness testified to , but to paint a brief overall impression of what happened at the star studded trial .
If you want to read exactly what happened , every word of the testimony of every witness is available on the “ internets . ”
I would not suggest wasting your time ; it is not terribly interesting .
Patrick Fitzgerald presented his case in a thorough , professional manner .
He brought many witnesses who spoke of learning from Libby that Plame was a CIA operative , all before the actual outing occurred .
Perhaps most damaging was the testimony of Cathie Martin , a Libby / Cheney assistant who stated that she told Libby of Plames ’ identity and employment status prior to it becoming public knowledge .
Mrs. Martin also testified about the White House strategy of allowing “ strategic leaks ” under the direction of Vice President Cheney .
Other White House employees were called , including one who said that Cheney had circles drawn around certain phrases from Wilson ’s Op - Ed piece that appeared in the Washington Post and began this fiasco .
He said that Cheney was clearly concerned and frequently talked to Libby about how to control the damage that was done by Wilson ’s article .
Fitzgerald called Tim Russert , from whom Libby claimed to have learned of Plame ’s covert position .
Russert testified that this was n’t true , that actually he had never heard of her until he read it in the Robert Novak column where her identity was first publicly revealed .
He called Ari Fleischer , who had requested and received immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony .
Fleischer said that he was “ stunned and scared to death ” once he learned of Plame ’s status , and that he was concerned that he might be in legal jeopardy because , as the President ’s press secretary , he had spoken about it many times from the White House podium .
This was done during the routine course of his duties before he realized who Ms. Plame actually was .
Judith Miller reluctantly testified that she learned of Plame ’s identity from Libby .
It is surprising that she was so reluctant with this information since she spent over 80 days in jail and lost her job and what little credibility she had trying to protect what Fitzgerald knew all along .
But , someone has to play the role of the martyr , I guess .
Fitzgerald put his case on very convincingly , bringing in just the proper amount of witnesses to weave a web around Libby that he could not possibly escape from .
Before he was finished , it became obvious that it would be more difficult to find out who had NOT leaked this information rather than who had .
But , that is not what this case is about .
It is about Libby ’s propensity for not being truthful with the grand jury , and then attempting to cover it up with more lies .
Now to the case presented by the defense .
They called very few witnesses .
Robert Novak , the person who actually wrote the article revealing Plame ’s identity , testified that he learned of her identity from Karl Rove and Richard Armitage , but “ could n’t remember ” if he had heard it from Libby or not .
Nothing he said was surprising , consider the fact that he has turned into nothing but a shill for the current administration and should not even be honored with the title “ journalist . ”
They called Walter Pincus , an editor at the Washington Post , who said that he learned the information from Fleischer , something that Fleischer had already denied under oath .
They also called Bob Woodward , who testified that his source was not Libby but instead Armitage .
None of this was new information , but stuff that had been common knowledge for months .
So , in simple terms , the defense did not really put up a defense .
They did call one person , whose name escapes me at the moment , to say that Libby “ has a terrible memory . ”
They did not call Libby to testify , which led to a tongue lashing from the judge who then refused to allow certain “ memory impairment ” evidence to be presented in front of the jury .
The refusal to allow some of this evidence could come back to haunt the judge on appeal , but it did move the case along and besides , there will be no appeal .
Fitzgerald had many rebuttal witnesses lined up and ready to go , all willing to testify to the fact that Libby actually is a brilliant man who rarely , if ever , forgets anything .
Calling these people turned out not to be necessary because of the rulings of the judge , so Fitzgerald declined to call any rebuttal witnesses .
That ’s pretty much the gist of the happenings at the trial , and it should be a slam dunk conviction for Fitzgerald .
We will move on now .
Many months ago I told you that this “ outing ” of a covert CIA operative would land right at the door of the Vice President .
I was wrong , I admit it .
Well , partly wrong , anyway .
The fact is that it did n’t actually LAND at his door , but it did pass through there on the way to another door .
And this door , my friends , is the door of George W. Boosh .
One new thing came out during all of this , though the jury did not hear it .
In reality it should n’t matter as it has nothing to do with the charges against him .
Libby ’s I “ knew and then forgot and then remembered I had forgotten or whatever the hell I ’m trying to remember or not remember ” defense is n’t going to work .
The new thing is this .
Robert Novak gave a draft of the article to someone who passed it along to Karl RoveAnd if you believe that Karl Rove had this in his possession in advance and did n’t share it with Boosh , I ’ve got some swamp land to sell you .
Novak has claimed that , of course , he had no way to know that this third party would pass it on to Rove or anyone else inside the administration .
Oh wait , I just found some more swamp land to sell .
Now whether or not this had any impact on the dimwit or his actions is up for argument .
But , this does prove that And maybe worse than that , he knew exactly where it came from before he spewed his “ if I find out that someone in my administration leaked this information they ’ll be gone ” BS .
What does any of this have to do with the Libby trial , you might ask ?
The answer is absolutely nothing .
It does show , however , that our Commander in Chief is a lying scumbag .
Like we did n’t know that already .
It is too bad that the Mainstream Media is paying little attention to any of this , or if they are , they certainly are n't sharing it with the American people .
Someday soon , however , they will be forced to examine this stuff yet again .
Patrick Fitzgerald , when announcing the indictment of Libby , said that what Libby had done was the equivalent of “ throwing sand in the face of the umpire ” and then asking him to make a call at the plate .
He could not pursue the investigation of the leak because Libby obstructed him from doing so by lying to the FBI and to the Grand Jury .
As it turns out , this is a perfect analogy and a perfect strategy for Booshco .
I can no longer claim that they have screwed up everything they have touched because they are now in position to do the unthinkable , and they planned it flawlessly .
They will also pull it off .
Scooter Libby will be convicted of the charges he faces , maybe as early as today .
It should take longer to elect a foreman for the jury than it will to get a unanimous guilty vote .
Justice , however , will not be served , and I would bet my house on it .
Boosh will Pardon Libby before he spends one minute in jail .
This is why they did not put on a defense , they knew going in that a Pardon would occur if Libby protected his boss , the Vampire Cheney .
If anyone actually believed the pre-trial nonsense that Cheney would testify , well I ’ve talked enough about swamp land .
First , they would have needed to have night court since being in the sun would undoubtedly cause Cheney to dissolve .
Second , Cheney under oath ?
Get real ; it ai n’t gonna happen , now or ever .
To realize why I am so certain of this , one must go back a ways and look at what happened during Watergate , and look at one of the key players in that debacle .
I ’ll begin by stating this .
Scooter Libby is no G. Gordon Liddy .
If you recall , during the Watergate crimes , the prosecutors jailed the entire lot of co-conspirators and waited for them to break and turn on Nixon .
One by one they did so .
But not Liddy .
This masochistic psychopath went so far as to hold his hand in the flame of a cigarette lighter the entire time he talked to investigators , and as they smelled his scorched skin , he asked again and again if they really thought that sitting in a jail cell would make him turn on his boss , Richard M. Nixon .
I guess he proved his point , and he spent upwards of eight years in jail as a result of his faithfulness .
To this day he has never spoken in a negative light about Nixon .
Scooter Libby does not strike me as that type of person .
He does n’t appear to have the fortitude to sacrifice himself for anyone .
In essence , he is a wimp , and would turn on a dime if given the proper incentive .
If we look further , we can now begin to see , through him and Booshco , what is really wrong with this country today .
I was in favor of the Pardon of Richard Nixon , though not necessarily for the reasons that Gerald Ford gave for doing so .
My thoughts were and still are , with a guy like Nixon , it was a power thing .
Jailing him would have done nothing further to damage him than stripping him of power and forcing him to essentially live in isolation for the rest of his life did .
For most President ’s , power means everything .
And for most , the loss of power is proper punishment for whatever crime they participate in .
( the current leader is NOT among that group , however )
That being said , there is a big difference between the Pardon of Nixon and the upcoming Pardon that will be given to Libby .
You see , Nixon himself was the cancer and had to be removed .
He was , and we survived .
In the current case , Libby is merely the cancerous lesion and removing him will have no deterring effect on the cancer that is spreading throughout Washington and across America .
To stop this spread , you must remove the inside source of the cancer , not just scrape off the top layer .
Libby is merely the top layer and is easily expendable , so long as you can keep him quiet .
The real cancer lies in Rove , the Vamp and Boosh .
Unfortunately , they have won , unless this man and his entire staff are impeached and removed from office .
It took that to remove Nixon , a herd of Republicans walking into his office and telling him that it was over .
It will take that and maybe more to remove Booshco .
Boosh will Pardon Libby , claiming that the real purpose of the special investigation was to find out if anyone broke the law by outing a covert CIA operative .
He will say that while he has the utmost respect for Patrick Fitzgerald , he knows Scooter Libby “ the man ” and knows that he would n’t deliberately lie to the FBI , a Grand Jury , or anyone else .
Then he will say that since no charges were brought against anyone for the “ outing itself , ” that Scooter boy should not have to go to jail because of his unfortunate forgetfulness .
He ’ll say that the pressure of the war was first and foremost on Scooter ’s mind , and that all should understand how it would be in such a situation .
He ’ll say that the whole Wilson affair was minor in comparison to his “ war on terror ” and that they gave it little thought .
The press will dig in , the documents prove otherwise , everyone will be pissed off for a while , but it will eventually be shoved aside .
Cheney will remain in his bunker directing the next insane war to cover up the current dirty and failed war ; it will be business as usual .
Sorry Kids , but in today ’s America , the good guys seldom win .

But Mr. Williams added : " You can not just blame the president , or any one person .
Everyone is partly to blame .
It 's the whole system . "
It was the combination of specific and systemic failures that many of those interviewed -- experts and ordinary people alike -- echoed .
Andrew Young , the former civil rights worker and mayor of Atlanta who was Jimmy Carter 's ambassador to the United Nations , was born in New Orleans 73 years ago , walked on its levees as a boy and " was always assured by my father that the Army Corps of Engineers had done a masterful job . "
But , Mr. Young said , " they 've been neglected for the last 20 years , " along with other pillars of the nation 's infrastructure , human and physical .
" I was surprised and not surprised , " he said of the failures and suffering of this week .
" It 's not just a lack of preparedness .
I think the easy answer is to say that these are poor people and black people and so the government does n't give a damn , " he said .
" That 's O.K. , and there might be some truth to that .
But I think we 've got to see this as a serious problem of the long - term neglect of an environmental system on which our nation depends .
All the grain that 's grown in Iowa and Illinois , and the huge industrial output of the Midwest has to come down the Mississippi River , and there has to be a port to handle it , to keep a functioning economy in the United States of America . "
Mr. Riley , the Charleston mayor , whose Police Department on Monday sent 55 officers to help keep order in Gulfport , Miss. , said he had long advocated creating a special military entity -- perhaps under the Corps of Engineers -- that could respond immediately to disasters .
" It 's not the police function , " he said .
" It 's that it 's an entity that knows how to quickly restore infrastructure and the essentials of order . "
He said his own experience with the Federal Emergency Management Agency during Hurricane Hugo in 1989 , when he had the National Guard on standby and then requested Army troops and marines , had convinced him that civilian bureaucracy was sometimes too caught up in the niceties .
" With the eye of Hugo over my City Hall , literally , I said to a FEMA official , ' What 's the main bit of advice you can give me ? ' and he said , ' You need to make sure you 're accounting for all your expenses , " Mayor Riley recalled .
" The tragedy of these things is the unnecessary pain in those early days , the complete destruction of normalcy . "
This morning I saw a news article about subliminal spam messages on ZDNet .
I was intrigued to read about it because a few days ago Nick FitzGerald wrote to me with an example spam that he dubbed ' subliminal ' .
I wrote back and told him I was going to blog about it and he said go ahead .
The blog post is Subliminal advertising in spam ?
and was posted on Monday , September 4 , 2006 .
That same day Slashdot picked up my blog post here .
Later it was also picked up by Digg .
So I was a little surprised that the ZDNet article did n't mention Nick , me , my blog , Slashdot , or Digg .
In fact , the article contains a link to Panda 's press release on the subject : PandaLabs detects a new spam technique in which they state " PandaLabs has detected a spam message that uses subliminal advertising techniques . " .
No mention of this blog anywhere there either , but there are two images of such a spam , both of which I believe were lifted directly from my blog without attribution .
The press release is dated the day after my post / Slashdot headline : Tuesday , September 5 , 2006 .
Here are the images side by side for comparisonImage from my blog postImage from Panda 's press release ( local archive of the image )
And I named my imagewhen I extracted it from the spam , and Panda named the same image .
The MD5 checksum of my image isand the Panda image has the checksum .
And I also thought the original was a bit large for my blog so I reduced it from 603x451 to 302x226 , the Panda image has the same reduced dimension .
Hmm .
Exactly the same image .
The other image in the press release is also , I believe , from my blog : Image from my blog postImage from Panda 's press release ( local archive of the image )
Once again , I named my imagewhen I extracted it from the spam , and Panda named the same image .
The MD5 checksum of my image isand the Panda image has the checksum .
Again I thought the original was a bit large for my blog so I reduced it from 603x451 to 302x226 , the Panda image has the same reduced dimension .
Hmm .
Exactly the same image , again .
So it looks a lot to me like Panda heard about my blog post ( perhaps through Slashdot ) and then passed Nick 's example off as their own research .
Of course , it 's possible that Panda the day after my blog post , independently found the same thing , named it subliminal spam , named the frames within the gif the same thing as me , extracted them from exactly the same spam image ( which they managed to capture even though spammers are adding random noise so that hashing is impossible ) and issued their press release .
On Wednesday , September 6 , 2006 ( two days after my blog post / Slashdot headline )
Sophos put out a press release Spammers use subliminal messages in latest pump - and - dump scams in which they state : " Experts at SophosLabs™ , Sophos 's global network of virus , spyware and spam analysis centers , have identified a " pump - and - dump " stock spam campaign which uses an animated graphic to display a " subliminal " message to potential investors .
" Once again the release does n't mention me , Nick , this blog , Slashdot , Digg , ...
It too includes an image that appears to be from the same spam campaign I was blogging about ( a pump and dump for the stock TMXO ) , but there 's no image borrowing here .
The image is from the same campaign but different , and they no doubt did n't borrow any images from me .
Clearly , Sophos could have seen the same spam campaign as Nick and I and come to the same conclusion and called it ' subliminal ' spam .
On Thursday , September 7 , 2006 it appears that SoftScan got into the game too .
They are mentioned in this article where it 's written : " SoftScan 's analysis of the latest pump - and - dump scam has discovered that an image appears for a split second every so often in the email with the word ' buy ' repeated several times .
" Disclaimer : I can't prove that any of these companies saw my blog post on Slashdot and then issued press releases , but the timing is interesting : my blog post comes first followed by press releases and articles using either the same image , the same campaign and all calling it ' subliminal spam ' .
Perhaps ' subliminal ' spam was an obvious name , and I 'm crazy , but ... An offer : on the other hand , if any company would like free reign to pass off things on my blog as their own work I have a simple offer for you : give me a small stock option in your company , call me a ' technical advisor ' or similar , and feel free to take what you want from here . : SoftScan 's Corporate Communications Manager Bo Engelbrechtsen comments below ( see comments section ) that they independently found this , and had never heard of this blog before . :
In a private email a Sophos employee I know well says : " I personally alerted Sophos 's PR team about this spammer trick [...]
The word " subliminal " was the first thing that came to my mind when I saw it . [...]
I do n't read John 's blog and am very disappointed with this insinuation .
We receive millions of spam e-mails to our traps every day , many of which get analyzed and looked at by spam analysts around the world .
We do n't need to steal someone else 's story ... "

In ESCAPE From SUBURBIA director Greg Greene once again takes us “ through the looking glass ” on a journey of discovery – a sobering yet vital and ultimately positive exploration of what the second half of the Oil Age has in store for us .
Through personal stories and interviews we examine how declining world oil production has already begun to affect modern life in North America .
Expert scientific opinion is balanced with “ on the street ” portraits from an emerging global movement of citizen ’s groups who are confronting the challenges of Peak Oil in extraordinary ways .
The clock is ticking .
ESCAPE From SUBURBIA asks the tough questions :
Are we approaching Peak Oil now ?
What are the controversies surrounding our future energy options ?
Why are a growing number of specialists and citizens skeptical of these options ?
What are ordinary people across North America doing in their own communities to prepare for Peak Oil ?
And what will YOU do as energy prices skyrocket and the Oil Age draws to a close ?
We went to the discount store yesterday to buy a French press and spotted a stainless steel , stove - top percolator .
It looks like , and sort of is , a piece of camping equipment .
Boy Scouts would use it , if they took coffee breaks .
It seemed American , as opposed to the Frenchy - ness of the French press .
Also , a goomba passing in the aisle said , “ Best way to make coffee … if you like it good and strong . ”
I drank three cups of percolated coffee this morning and feel like I am going to explode with happiness and nerves .
I feel as if I will disco to the subway train .
The guy is right .
The coffee is strong , and it is good .
Now try Googling “ percolated coffee ” .
The internet thinks I ’m doing it wrong , that I should have gone for the French press .
Even the Wikipedia entry sniffs that percolated coffee is out of fashion .
It ’s weird ; now I feel like I ’ve been outrageously rebellious buying this percolator .
After all , everyone who knows anything about coffee knows that this is an inferior method .
And caring about your coffee is one of those markers , you know , of intelligence and sophistication .
I bet if you mapped out the percolator households and the French press households , they would perfectly correlate with a map of blue states and red states .
French presses are for liberals , percolators are for heathens .
But for how long ?
I predict within 18 months , percolators will become huge .
Hipsters , tired of their espresso - brewed triple Americanos , will develop an ironic appreciation for percolated coffee .
A percolator will be featured in some sort of spread in Vice , and a few months later we ’ll see a percolator on the front page of Sunday Styles .
And then William - Sonoma will come out with a $ 429 retro stovetop percolator , and I ’ll sell my vintage model on eBay and use the proceeds to buy myself a shiny new espresso maker .

Did you spend your childhood digging up the backyard in search of dinosaur bones ?
Still dream of uncovering your very own Tyrannosaurus rex ?
Aside from working through a PhD in paleontology which can take up to eight years , not including undergraduate work you can try stepping out on your own to live the dream .
Paul Sereno , a world - renowned paleontologist at the University of Chicago who has discovered dinosaurs on five continents over the past two decades , helps distill his art into five basic steps .
Step 1 .
Figure out where to look
First things first : pick a location that is most likely to have dinosaur fossils .
Here are three tools you 'll need to find it :
Geologic maps show rock types and ages in a given area .
Rocks close in age to dinosaur fossils , which date to roughly 240 to 65 million years ago , are the best places to look .
One possible source is the United States Geological Survey 's geologic map database .
Topographical maps help you determine if an area is accessible ( Hint : if it is covered with road , it is n't ) .
U.S. maps are available in most hiking stores or online , but if you 're dino hunting outside the country you might have to seek out specialized map libraries and be able to speak and read the local language .
You can always try Internet - based maps , but you might be digging in places with poor mobile service coverage .
Scientific journals may have written information about a particular region and often include fossil maps , which could help narrow down where to search .
Step 2 .
Pack the necessities
Dinosaur hunters use whatever they can to chip rock away from fossils .
Sereno recommends , at bare minimum , a geology hammer and chisel for the larger chunks and a finely - pointed awl for the smaller details .
Other common tools include paintbrushes , used to dust off specimens , and plaster and burlap to make so - called " field jackets , which protect specimens and keep them in place on the way home .
Bring your maps and a Global Positioning Satellite .
And , do n't forget water , food and sunscreenmost fossil beds are in hot , dry regions with little protection from the elements . [ 7 Surprising Dinosaur Facts ]
Step 3 .
Find some leg bones
Once you get all your gear on site , pull out your GPS and your maps to figure out where you are and where to begin your hunt .
Next , you and your crew canvass the area looking for exposed spots rocky outcrops that are n't covered in soil , for example .
Scour the area for bone fragments .
If you do n't find any , repeat until you do .
Once you find a bone fragment , dig deeper ( be gentle ! ) .
Be ready for a long stay Sereno says digs can last up to four months .
Step 4 .
Get them home
Dinosaur fossils are typically too heavy for a plane a cache from a single animal can weigh several tons .
So , you 'll need a series of trucks , freighters and trains to get your pieces back home .
Step 5 . Clean them up
Once you 've got the fossils back in the lab ( or your garage ) , you 'll need to clean them up with fine tools dental equipment , small jackhammers and needles to clear away even the tiniest grains of dirt .
Finally , memorialize your work with drawings , photographs and a written scientific paper .
Shortcut
If you 're looking for a quicker fix , consider volunteering on a dig or signing up for a dino - themed vacation .
Join Sereno's expeditions through Project Exploration , a non-profit that provides private dino - hunting tours in Montana or Wyoming ( 100 percent of the proceeds funds youth science education programs geared towards underrepresented minorities and girls ) .
Or , try the Museum of Western Colorado , which offers multiple package trips in Colorado and Utah , some of which include white water rafting and wine tasting , or Baisch 's Dinosaur Digs in Montana for half - or full - day excursions , where you might dig even dig up that T. rex .

He said he felt his job demanded that he advocate for the tens of millions of H.I.V.- infected people , including those in South Africa , even though many say a United Nations official has no right to criticize a member state .
Mr. Lewis has long been critical of countries for failing to help women who become infected .
“ Gender inequality is driving the pandemic , and we will never subdue the gruesome force of AIDS until the rights of women become paramount in the struggle , ” he said .
The inequality of women makes them highly vulnerable to becoming infected through “ marital rape to rape as a war crime , ” Mr. Lewis said , adding that , while sexual violence occurs everywhere , in Africa , “ The violence and the virus go together . ”
Preventing the transmission of the AIDS virus from infected pregnant women to newborns , which can be done with simple regimens , is “ very near the top in the hierarchy of preventive measures , ” he said .
But the vast majority of pregnant women in the world , he said , go without such prevention , and even the women who receive it are not given full treatment to help keep them alive , so their children often become orphans .
Yet the world is doing very little for orphans whose number is expected to grow to 18 million by 2010 .
“ I appeal to everyone to recognize that we are walking on the knife ’s edge of an unsolvable human catastrophe , ” Mr. Lewis said .

“ Ideas rise out of communities of creative people .
Priority is usually meaningless . ”
( John H. Lienhard , University of Houston )
What do the following have in common : a derailleur gear , an aluminum frame , the freewheel , disc wheels , anatomical saddles , clipless pedals , suspension , folding bikes ?
Answer : they were all ideas that originated in the late 1800s .
The late English cycling historian , John Pinkerton , once remarked , “ Think of a new idea in bicycle design and someone will have already invented it , probably in the nineteenth century . ”
After the fundamentals of bicycle design had been conceived by the end of the 1860s , a multitude of subsequent improvements were suggested and tried .
In some cases the ideas died , marking the end of that particular evolutionary branch .
In other instances , the concepts were embraced to the point that they led to commercial successes .
It ’s worth noting that Jim Hurd , the former curator of the Bicycle Museum of America , says that at the turn of the century there were two buildings in Washington DC that held every patent in the U.S.
One building held patents covering every type of product you can think of .
The other building was reserved specifically for bicycle patents .
It ’s a manifestation of how much energy had gone into refining the bicycle and it ’s the reason why it ’s such a challenge for modern designers to make any sea-change improvements .
When browsing through the timeline below , remember that bicycle inventions that were successful were rarely the result of a spontaneous flash of inspiration by one person .
More commonly , they were built on previous ideas and experiments and no one date or individual can always be attributed to a particular design .
Furthermore , many viable prototypes were abandoned and not pursued until years later .
One could argue , perhaps , that an invention should have successful “ progeny ” to be considered a true milestone .
Some “ milestones ” can thus be challenged in that they only gained importance in retrospect ; they might have marked a stepping stone to something more advanced from which there was no turning back but in reality , the innovation was quickly forgotten and had no permanent impact .
All this creates both ambiguity and controversy as to who the “ true ” inventor was and the date when the first successful version was produced .
To add to the confusion , in recent years several early icons of bicycle history have been relegated to the hopper of popular myth .
Most , if not all , alleged developments before the granting of the Von Drais patent in 1818 are highly conjectural .
For example , the drawing of a “ bicycle ” ( circa 1493 ) purported to be by Giacomo Caprotti , a pupil of Leonardo da Vinci ( photo left ; click to enlarge ; source # 1 ) , is now acknowledged by most to be a hoax .
The Flemish or German “ Bicycle Window , ” which was installed in Stoke Poges church in the 16th or 17th century ( photo right ; click to enlarge ; source # 2 ) , shows an angel on a device that some argue looks like a prototype hobbyhorse .
It is far more likely to be a one - wheeled contraption that was often associated with cherubims and seraphims in mediaeval iconography .
There is also the risk that , unless there is credible documentary evidence , some early innovations are actually subsequent bicycle priority claims from the 1890s or later and are thus false stepping stones that do not convey an accurate history .
For example , a vehicle with two wheels in - line ( photo left ; click to enlarge ; source # 3 ) was attributed to a Comte de Sivrac around 1791 but this story was most likely created by the historian Baudry de Saunier in 1891 and has erroneously been copied by numerous authors ever since .
Other claims are more problematical .
A case in point is the chain and rear cog-driven velocipede attributed to Meyer and Guilmet in 1869 ( photo right ; click to enlarge ; source # 4 ) and which is now in the Musée des Arts et Métiers .
Serious questions remain unanswered as to the date and history of the bike even though it is held up by some to be a true missing link in bicycle evolution .
Arguments about who invented the bicycle are thus rarely fruitful and never conclusive .
In all likelihood , the Baron von Drais ( Germany ) , Kirkpatrick Macmillan ( Scotland ) , the Michaux family ( France ) , Henry Lawson ( England ) and many others , all contributed critical elements but it was the Starley family of Coventry , England who can perhaps lay claim to bringing it all together as a commercial venture even though their first models were unsuccessful and they did not necessarily “ invent ” the designs that they incorporated .
Nevertheless , within 20 years after the Boneshaker appeared in the 1860s , most of the basic elements of modern bicycle design had appeared and were included in Starley ’s 1885  Rover ( photo left ; click to enlarge ; source # 5 ) .
Even though controversy still surrounds Macmillan ’s machine , it was prophetic in that it included three of these critical design elements : ( 1 ) two smallish , equally - sized wheels with the rider sitting between them ( 2 ) a rear - wheel drive and ( 3 ) a front wheel that was steered and was independent of the transmission .
The additional two pieces of the puzzle that were subsequently incorporated by Starley and others were ( 4 ) a “ geared - up ” drivetrain ( such that the number of pedal revolutions does not equal the number of wheel rotations ) and ( 5 ) the chain drive itself which was eventually to become ubiquitous .
Since those early days , there have been periods of relative famine when it comes to dramatic improvements in bicycle or component design .
This was largely a result of two phenomena .
First was the rise of the automobile in the 1920s .
The second cause was rather more ominous , namely the perverse policy of the Union Cycliste Internationale and other cycling organizations to ban radical or innovative bicycles from competing in their sanctioned events .
These prohibitions included derailleur gears , wheel rims made of anything except wood and frames of a configuration other than the standard diamond .
Not surprisingly , nothing earth shattering shows up between 1910 and 1930 , until Tullio Campagnolo begins to influence the industry .
There seems to be another period of relative inactivity in the 1950s and 60s but this was followed by the bicycle boom of the 80s led by Japanese and American companies and which spawned the high - tech machines of today .
Trickle - down of the technology means that sophisticated bicycles can now be had for relatively modest prices .
In the last two decades , there have been many recent advances in materials , especially the increasingly widespread use of carbon fiber and titanium .
In addition , the demise of the threaded fork and quill stem in favor of the threadless fork / stem combination , the increased numbers of gears and the improvements in wheel design are valid contributions to bicycle evolution .
Finally , the fat - tire folks would probably consider the new fork and frame suspensions as fairly revolutionary changes in their bikes even though there were marketable versions of effective suspension systems that date back 100 years .
Other design changes , such as larger steerer tubes , integrated headsets , and compact frames may still be controversial but do seem to be working their way into the mainstream of bicycle development .
And what of the future ?
For the mass market , the industry will need to continue to improve those things that discourage more people from riding : comfort , finicky gears , oily chains , flat tires etc .
The road bike business got a severe wake - up call when the mountain bike phenomenon occurred although the playing field has leveled out somewhat since the heady days of the 1980s and 90s when the fat - tire contingent were outselling their skinny - wheeled brethren .
However , since then , the “ comfort ” and hybrid bikes have now created a sizable niche in the market .
Some form of suspension could soon end up on every good bike , road or mountain of any style .
Perhaps recumbents and small - wheeled bicycles will now move further into the mainstream ; their aficionados always claim that they should not be regarded as “ velo - eccentrics ” but sales figures do not really support them yet .
Even though they might be an anathema to the hard - core sports riders , new pedaling - assist mechanisms may also become more common .
At some point , maybe the crank / chain / cogs system of the drivetrain will be replaced by something totally different or at least by non-metallic components that need no lubrication .
In the meantime , it is inevitable that still further increases in the number of gears is probably being considered though with thirty - speed systems now readily available , one must continue to ask what the practical limit is .
Perhaps CVT ( Continuous Variable Transmission ) shifting system will achieve the light weight , robustness and efficiency to become a market player .
Effective electronic / automatic shifting will undoubtedly remain on the radar screens of component manufacturers .
Even though the innovative attempts by Browning Research and Mavic failed as commercial ventures , Shimano is still in that market with their Nexus Auto - D unit , rolled out in 1999 , which analyzes cadence and speed and automatically shifts for the rider .
More importantly , Campagnolo ’s Electronic Record , possibly due in 2005 , will offer both front and rear on - demand automated shifting .
In addition , the hundred - year - old Anglo - French competition between hub and derailleur gears might not be over .
In 1998 Rohloff introduced a 14 - speed hub gear that uses needle bearings , thus mitigating in part , one of hub gears ’ inherent disadvantages , that of increased frictional resistance .
Tire developments will continue , especially in respect of lower hysteresis losses and greater puncture resistance through improved materials .
Practical tubeless or lightweight solid tires would be a boon to cyclists if weight and rolling resistance remain within acceptable limits .
Clipless pedals that are truly safe for recreational cyclists have yet to appear .
[ Editor ’s note :
It ’s possible to get injured if you are n’t practiced enough . ]
Shimano tried it and admitted it was one area of research in which they failed .
Good quality spokeless wheels for the masses could go hand in hand with a move to smaller wheels which are less affected by sidewinds .
Something similar to Mike Burrows ’ monoblade wheel mounting system which enables tires and chains ( or drive belts ) to be easily be removed without taking the wheel off or splitting the chain might also gain mainstream acceptance .
Lightweight disc brakes might well end up on all high - end bikes as they too continue to improve .
Looking further out in time , magnetorheological or electrorheological brake and suspension systems ( which rely on fluids which change in viscosity when exposed to electrical or magnetic fields ) might become viable .
Bicycle computers will unquestionably get more and more sophisticated and minicomputer - controlled applications for various functions will become commonplace .
As if to reinforce the premise made at the beginning of this article , many of these ideas have been tried in the past but time will tell which of them will qualify for future lists of milestones .

Introduction by Schwinn of the balloon tire and “ streamlined ” bikes which leads to rugged bikes that can take the abuse of teenage boys and which set a forty - year trend .
CORRECTIONS by Leon Dixon of the National Bicycle History Archive of America : " The implication here is that Schwinn invented something that did not exist , which is one of the biggest myths in bicycle history .
Schwinn merely copied what they saw going on in Europe .
Both Sears and Montgomery Ward had bicycles in 1932 that had balloon tires in the USA , a full year BEFORE Schwinn .
And the streamline movement in bicycles was really pioneered by Sears and Huffman .
Schwinn had a clunky diamond frame with straight tubes and a streamlined tank in 1934 , but Sears Elgin ( 1935 ) and Huffman Dayton ( 1936 ) had fully streamlined frames , tanks , etc. " mountain bike 1938 USA Schwinn markets the " Fore - wheel " brake , " Cantilever Frame " and the " Spring Fork .

Leon Dixon of the National Bicycle History Archive of America notes : " This is a very serious myth .
First , Schwinn merely copied the Huffy Penguin which existed BEFORE the Sting - Ray .
And these bicycles were pioneers in the 20 - inch bicycle revolution / genre , but certainly did not necessarily father BMX .

I used many published and Internet sources for the above list .
It was remarkable how many inaccuracies and red herrings needed to be purged from my first drafts as I learned more about the controversies surrounding both the early claims and the more recent history .
In this effort , I received many invaluable comments from the individuals listed below .
Notwithstanding their generous assistance , any remaining errors that remain are mine alone .
It is also worth observing that controversies still abound , not all my correspondents were necessarily in agreement but it would be most presumptuous of me to claim that resolution of such differences of opinion is within either my ability or the scope of this article .

HUMAN BABIES BORN with tails ?
That may sound like a headline from the Weekly World News , but it was the respected New Scientist magazine that recently published a cover story about the phenomenon of evolution “ running backward . ”
Entertainment value aside , the article represents a new twist in the politically charged debate about evolution .
The author of “ The Ancestor Within , ” Michael Le Page , cited the babies with tails as a likely example of atavism , a phenomenon in which ancestral traits suddenly reappear after thousands or even millions of years .
Another example , one remarked on by Charles Darwin , is the appearance in some human mouths of large , ape - like canine teeth .
( Stephen King , call your office . )
It ’s not just humans who experience these altered states .
Le Page also cites the less cringe - making example of a humpback whale with leg - like appendages that was caught off Canada ’s Vancouver Island in 1919 .
These and other throwbacks might seem to call into question the validity of evolution , which has been on something of a roll lately , with a federal judge ’s decision last year against a Pennsylvania school district that wanted to teach “ intelligent design ” and , only this week , the decision by the Kansas State Board of Education to repeal guidelines that said there was “ considerable scientific and public controversy ” over human origins .

In fact , Le Page suggests , atavisms like tails on humans are the exceptions that prove the evolutionary rule .
Atavisms are possible , he says , because genes for primitive traits have n’t disappeared from the genome ; they simply have been switched off .
In rare cases , they are switched back on ( and then the tails are promptly snipped off ) .
Sometimes , Le Page adds , so - called reverse evolution serves the cause of improving a species by allowing it to adapt to a changed environment .
Atavism is n’t the only explanation for the reappearance of a seemingly extinct trait or body part .
It ’s also possible that some life forms that have lost a certain trait evolve it again “ from scratch , ” through the same mutations that produced it in the first place .
After all , different species sometimes develop similar features separately -- a process known as “ convergent evolution . ”
But the existence of atavism complicates the case against evolution .
Far from undermining Darwinism , throwbacks challenge the creationist idea that every living species emerged full - blown in its present form .
Atavism is impossible unless there ’s something to throw back to -- like an ancestor with a tail that nobody wanted to snip off .

WP Cumulus Flash tag cloud by Roy Tanck requires Flash Player 9 or better .
During my 8 years of Linux on and off usage I have tried more distros than I have chocolate bars .
Each one of my previous encounters meant that I had to spend at least 2 days configuring before I have a desktop that I was somewhat comfortable with .
With Ubuntu Feisty
Fawn ’s latest test beta –for the first time ever– this was not the case .
I was up and running with all the niceties I wanted within 2 hours .
I received my brand new laptop this past Monday with Vista Home Basic in it .
I spent 2 hours with Vista , I decided that I did n’t like much of its usability , and I immediately burned an Ubuntu preview ISO and installed it on my shiny new DELL Inspiron 640 m .
There was a problem though and X11 would crash on load — and the graphical safe mode would not work either ( confirmed bug ) .
The 915resolution hack was not needed for my Intel graphics card , but I needed to have more information for my laptop ’s LCD .
By manually entering the vertical and horizontal sync in the xorg .
conf file it fixed the problem for my 1440×900 screen and I was able to load the LiveCD and finally install Feisty on the hard drive .
Installation was a breeze , very fast and easy to go by , although the “ advanced ” button that let ’s you configure where the bootloader should be installed it could use some friendlier “ names ” rather than just ( hd0,0 ) .
Ubuntu found Vista ’s partitions and automatically added them to the GRUB boot menu .
I was not able to test FreeBSD and BeOS / Zeta partitions to check if they are recognized by Ubuntu ’s GRUB automatically ( previous versions of Ubuntu did n’t recognize them ) .
A positive point about the new version is the booting speed : Feisty boots in 40 seconds on my laptop , while Vista needs about 50 ( with McAfee turned off ) .
Additionally , Ubuntu now seems to be more usable than before with 256 MBs of RAM ( with CUPS services turned off ) and 512 MBs seem to be more than enough — a number that ’s the minimum for Vista .
The default Ubuntu desktop looks a lot like its predessesor versions although the artwork is updated .
Personally , I still prefer the default Clearlooks and Tango icons and thankfully , these were included .
Compiz is now part of Ubuntu although turned off by default because it still has major problems .
I would personally go with AIXGL and Beryl instead of the slower - evolving Compiz ( after re-writing Beryl ’s pref panels of course to be more humane / sane ) .
Updating Ubuntu and installing new apps is now a breeze .
Although Ubuntu has 5 GUI applications that are package - related and that can create some confusion , if the user gets used to them he will never have a problem installing anything on his computer .
Firefox has been conditioned to “ understand ” . deb files and a wizard is loading when you click to such a file and installs it .
The Add / Remove application right under the “ Applications ” Gnome menu is another dead give - away on how to install other popular Linux apps on your computer .
And if the user is more proficient and knows what he / she was , there is always Synaptic .
In the Administration menu you will also find the global preferences for package management and the “ Update Manager ” , a utility similar to Apple ’s Mac OS X update facility .
Only problem with the refreshing of the repositories is that each time you refresh them , you need to download 5 MBs of data ( that ’s with the restricted and multiverse repositories enabled ) .
Users on slower connections will hate that .
Ubuntu must do something to reduce the amount of data downloaded for each repository ( the main US server that it ’s most up - to - date I found it to be slow , so some data - diet would benefit all users , not just users on slow connections ) .
There is a new proprietary policy at Ubuntu now and so some restricted software is easily accessible for download , while others can be installed on demand , e.g. when Totem identifies a missing codec .
With this way I was easily up and running with mp3 and many video codecs support in minutes .
However , not all is great with this as new bugs arise : I manually installed libdvdcss because this is not included in the restricted list and Totem now refuses to playback any DVD if you try to load it via Totem ’s menu — although it plays fine via HAL when you popup the DVD in the drive ( but no chapters or fast forward is possible as all DVD menu options are frozen ) .
There is also a new “ Restricted Drivers Manager ” panel under Administration which let ’s you enable / disable non-free drivers .
I had to install Linuxant ’s HSF modem drivers for my laptop and lo-and - behold , after a reboot the driver indeed showed up there !
I also have ndiswrapper installed for my WiFi card using proprietary firmware files , but ndiswrapper is not listed there .
Please note that Ubuntu mistakenly loads the BCM43 xx driver for my Broadcomm / Dell 1390 WiFi card and that resulted in a lot of errors in the terminal by the system ( missing firmware ? ) .
I had to blacklist the BCM43 xx driver before I could successfully install ndiswrapper and finally get WiFi support .
[ Update : I installed the bcm43 xx - cutter package and installed the required firmware and WiFi now works with the open source driver which unfortunately is not stable ( I lose connection after a minute or so ) , so I have to continue using ndiswrapper which seems very stable . ]
NetworkManager is very well - done btw , a real pleasure to have around and get connected to WiFi networks on a wim .
My favorite administrative panel is the “ Language support ” .
While I originally installed Ubuntu with the US locale , it was not before long that I needed some Greek and French support .
What do you know ?
Installing new locales and easily have your Gnome adapt to each language is just a few clicks away .
Another fine moment is that Ubuntu supports suspend - to - RAM ( sleep ) on my laptop out of the box , although I noticed that once every 5 - 6 wake ups some stuff can get screwy ( e.g. X dying , network card not responding etc ) .
As for battery life , support is not as good as on Windows ’ : my laptop can deliver up to 7 hours of battery life with my 9 - cell extended battery , but I get about 5 hours with Ubuntu ( with all wireless off , screen brightness low ) .
On the positive side again , the touchpad ’s scroll wheel is working out of the box , the onboard SD card reader works perfectly , I am now able to select which sound card I want as my main desktop sound card via a GUI and all of Dell ’s “ special buttons ” on the laptop ( including media buttons , wireless / brightness on / off ) are all working out of the box .
Is n’t that something !
So far , I am very happy with Ubuntu because most things just work , the desktop looks fabulous and it does what I want it to do without having to dig where each option is ( unlike Vista ’s new control panel ) .
There were very few the times that I had to pop to the terminal to carry out an important action .
However , this being a beta , I did have some problems with some packages , and as a good citizen I did my part to file bug reports .
Some of these problems include : the i810 driver would not playback HD video ( Xv crashing ) if I would not add the Cachelines option in the Xorg.conf , copy / paste from Firefox does not work if Firefox is then closed down ( this was fixed last year for Gnome apps , time to fix Firefox too ) , Gossip does not connect to anything else but jabber.org ( e.g. no gtalk ) , digicam ’s RAW files open by default with the wrong applications ( only Cinepaint and UFRaw can handle these but they are not set as defaults for the RAW mime types ) , I have bad AC97 “ scratchy ” sound with most SDL games ( e.g. Neverball , LTris etc ) , Bluetooth would not work at all here if you do n’t run “ hcitool hci0 reset ” before loading the service , there is no option in the gnome - mouse pref panel to disable tap - to - click on touchpads ( gsynaptics is really buggy so I prefer to not mess with it ) , HAL is not built with libsmbios and so the new Gnome “ brightness applet ” does not support any DELL laptop , FFmpeg is built without AAC ( so it ’s not possible to encode videos for my cellphone ) etc .
However , these are not problems that I can’t live with or not find workarounds .
I ’ve been an Arch / Slackware Linux user for the last 3 years , but Ubuntu has won me the last few days because of the conveniences it brings .
The point of the matter is , I am now older .
I am 33 years old and I just do n’t have the same energy as I used to to deal with stupid issues that they should not be there , or with removal or non-development of conveniences for no good reason .
Ubuntu is a distro that obviously has paid attention to detail ( and everyone who knows me from my past writings knows how much I can bitch about “ defaults ” and “ details ” ) and has found a good middle ground between hard core Linux users and new users from the Windows / OSX land .
I am looking forward for the final version of Feisty Fawn in April and you should do too .
1 Get a five foot sheet of aluminum foil ( standard one foot wide Reynolds Wrap brand will do nicely . )
2
Fold the sheet four times into five equal segments so that you end up with a 1x1 foot square , making sure that you fold over the dull side of the foil leaving the square shiny on both sides .
3
Use scissors to cut from one corner of the square to the center , making a straight line .
4
Bend the foil from one side of the cut under the other , making a slight cone .
Again , make sure that the outside of the cone has a shiny side of the foil ; this is VERY important .
5
Place the cone on your head and squash the top and sides to make it fit snugly .
6 Apply Scotch tape liberally making sure to secure the cut in the foil and any form - fitting creases made in step 5 .
These instructive diagrams are also available in an easy - to - print PDF format for non-commercial use by concerned educators and paranoid bill posters .
7
Use more tape to secure AFDB to your cranium .
A Note About The Shiny Side :
It can't be stressed enough how important it is to have the shiny side pointing out .
This is needed because the shiny side is most reflective to psychotronic radiation , while the dull side can actually , in certain environmental conditions , absorb it .
However , as is illustrated in the instructions above , it is also wise to complement this with a layer of foil pointing shiny side in .
This will keep your brain waves , which are also reflected by the shiny side , from being picked up by mind - reading equipment .
There is a small number of aluminum foil researchers who believe that this may cause an alpha - wave harmonic to build up in the skull resulting in memory loss or pseudo - religious visions , but their findings have never been replicated by the aluminum foil research community at large .
Even if their findings are validated , the risk involved is small compared to the potential of mind - intrusion .
Foil Thickness :
How thick is your aluminum foil ?
Find out using the ZPi Aluminum Foil Thickness Calculator ( pops up into separate window , requires Javascript ) .
If you do not have Javascript , use this formula ( with grams and centimeters ) : ( ( mass / 2.702 ) / ( width * length ) ) * 10000 = thickness in microns
If your foil is less than 16 microns , increase the number of layers used in construction .
Optional :
You may augment your AFDB with random bits of foil , wire , small electronic parts , etc. .
Canadian coins should also be considered as they are high in nickel content .
Nickel , while not having the psychotronic deflecting properties of aluminum ( or even tin ) , can act to refract psychotronic beams , thereby helping to scrambling the mind control signals as they are deflected off of the underlying aluminum surface of the AFDB .
This will result in a lowered chance of retransmission of the signal .
However , you should avoid American and European coins at all costs as they contain aluminum based mind control circuitry .
Canadian coins are free of this threat mainly due to the Canadian government 's choice of neglecting psychotronic research in favor of research into giant robotics .

I was raised in a strict household .
My parents bore offspring from the early - 50's to the mid-60's .
I was around the middle of this brood .
With nine mouths to feed , we did not have a lot of extras .
We worked for simple things , like bicycles .
Nothing wrong with that .
It 's what we knew .
And we were given a great foundation , on which we could create a life for ourselves .
As I said , my parents were strict - which made me not wish to be such with my kids .
Ah , my kids ...
I 'm in my forties , and the wife is a bit younger .
I make a fine income , and try not to sweat anything .
I get up ... have coffee ... look out at the ocean ... read the paper ... move onto my business .
I appreciate not having a house full of screaming kids in the morning ( something that was impossible when I grew up ) .
All I ask of my kids is to ; a ) be respectful of everyone , b ) be honest c ) get good grades , d ) clean their rooms .
I do not ask for much , nor do I demand much .
However ... that is going to change tonight .
Events that occurred this morning will bring about change like these kids have never known .
The wife has kept me in the dark about some things as well .
It 's my fault .
I accept it .
But I can reverse this downward trend - now .
My generation ( baby - boomers ) has found that it is easier to go around a wall , than climb over over it - or knock it down .
I 'm as guilty as anyone .
My guilt turned into rage this morning .
My son ( and my wife ) convinced me that he NEEDED a car ( he 's seventeen ) .
I was not keen on a kid driving , that has trouble standing a surfboard , or walking down the stairs without tripping .
But I relented ( again , why fight it ) .
With some stipulations , we aquired a car for this child .
The rules were put in place , and he proclaimed we were the greatest parents in the worls .
Uh huh ...
It 's 12:00 pm , and he has yet to get out of bed .
His mother has been instructed to tell my prodigy that he is GROUNDED .
We have never done this , but we are today .
And I mean GROUNDED in his room !
Not out by the pool .
Not in the gameroom .
His cluttered abode is where he better be when I get home tonight .
And I 'm going to be stopping for a drink , first .
I deserve a drink after this morning .
Let me tell you about my day .
I go out to my car in the driveway ( I have a three - car garage - and " hers " is the only one that fits inside ) .
My insanely over - priced piece of shit refuses to start today ( 3rd time in 2 months - the car is 6 - monthss old ) .
Okay ... I call ' AAA ' ; it will 45 - 60 minutes .
No time to wait .
Okay ... I 'm going to take my kids ' car .
I go in and retrieve the keys ( everyone is till asleep @ 8 am ) .
I leave a note telling him to call me .
His car is down the street at a friends house .
Why ?
He claimed that our driveway was too crowded ( and the other kids might scratch it ) .
Okay ... I find his car ... set off the alarm ...
Shit !
People , one word ; LOJACK .
Goddamn , I hate those alarms .
Anyways I get in the car , after noticing the REALLY nice rims & tires on it .
Hmmm , how did he pay for those ?
WHEN , did he get those ?
I get in , and notice a new STEERING WHEEL ... without the AIRBAG - that I demanded he have .
Oh , this car is totally bitchin ' dude !
It gets better ... I start it up ...
A huge racket comes from the exhaust ( not stock anymore ! ) ...
And the stereo starts screaming out profanities !
The backseat is now occupied by a huge box with speakers in it ... and fast - food trash ... and ' ziz - zag ' papers ... and empty ' trojan ' wrappers ( a chip off the ' ole block ) .
To say the least I am pissed .
I proceed to drive this rattling , screaming ( I tear the faceplate off - finally ) , piece of doo - doo down the road .
I swear , I think I awakened everyone in the neighborhood .
I head out onto PCH , and drive less than a mile ... when MB 's finest pulls me over ... WTF ?
I know I was n't speeding .
The officer comes up to the car , and asks for my license and insurance card ...
I hand over the license , and tell him I 'm not sure where the insurance card is - ' it 's my son's car ' ... " look in the glovebox " ( he is - actually - smiling now ) ... I open the glovebox ... and a small BONG falls out ...
I look at him ... he looks at me ...
This is not happening !
Oh , but it is .
The first thing I say is 'it 's not mine !'... " um , sir , could you step out of the car , please " ... I get out , and we step onto the sidewalk .
He tells me he stopped me for having an illegal exhaust ( no shit - it sounds like two - dozen weedwhackers coming down the street ) .
He also informs me that there are plenty more violations on this car ...
And I start laughing ...
He asks why am I laughing ...
And I tell him how my day is going .
" What about the water - pipe ? " Indeed !
I inform him that this is all a surprise to me , but I would like him to write up everything that is illegal about the vehicle .
He looks at me like I 'm crazy .
But I want my kid to learn a lesson .
And the officer obliges me .
He , even , finds some weed in the trunk ... 17 tickets later , we are finished ... almost ...
I ask him if I can keep all of the drug paraphenalia ?
" Why ? " I want my kid to destroy it .
I want this kid to know his " fuck - off " days are over .
The officer agrees .
I could see he was wishing he could be there tonight , for the " lesson " .
He was pretty decent about the whole thing .
This guy took , almost , a half - hour to go through all of this paperwork - and search .
I thank him , and head out ...
He tells me if I get stopped again today , that I should show all the citations to the other officer - and I should not have any problems ... Problems ?!!
We have problems .
I have lost control of my family .
My wife is a co-conspirator .
She has just been told that I want a listing of all of our household bills & accounts .
' Yes , dear - we are going to perform an audit ' .
She is protesting , but I do not care .
This is war .
I know my family loves me , but they have played me for a fool .
I may be a fool , but I am not dumb .
She does not know that I just found out my son is in Summer school , because of bad grades .
She does n't know that DMV has provided me with her , and his , records ; apparently they have a problem with obeying traffic laws .
It 's not going to be easy , but something must be done .
I swear , I feel like I have become my father ...
I want the best for my family , and feel something radical must happen .
I can only hope they - truly - understand it is for our own good .
Some things that will be addressed tonight ;1 )
Son 's vehicle is gone ; oil up that chain on your bicycle .
2 )
All three kids will empty out the garage ; sell it / donate it / whatever .
3 ) Mom will have a household budget .
4 ) Chores - that 's right ; everyone will have assigned chores .
5 ) Chores will be done , before anything else .

Mr Robertson is an influential figure in US politics
Tourism Ministry spokesman Ido Hartuv said Israel would not sign a contract with Mr Robertson to build a biblical theme park by the Sea of Galilee .
Mr Robertson suggested on his popular TV show the stroke was a punishment for Israel 's withdrawal from Gaza .
His remarks were condemned by the US government and American Jewish groups .
Mr Robertson was leading a group of evangelical Christians hoping to build the Galilee World Heritage Park .
You read the Bible :
This is my land , and for any prime minister of Israel who decides he 's going to carve it up and give it away , God says no , this is mine
Pat Robertson
The centre was expected to cover nearly 35 acres ( 14 hectares ) north - east of the Mount of Beatitudes , where Jesus is believed to have delivered the Sermon on the Mount .
It would have had a park , an auditorium , a Holy Land exhibition , outdoor amphitheatres , information centre and a media studio .
The Israeli government had tentatively agreed to provide land and infrastructure for the centre in the hope of generating millions of dollars from tourism .
But relations soured when Mr Robertson said God wanted Israel to be whole and undivided and had therefore punished Mr Sharon for Israel 's pull - out from the Gaza Strip last year .
" You read the Bible : This is my land , and for any prime minister of Israel who decides he 's going to carve it up and give it away , God says no , this is mine , " he said last week .
' Unacceptable '
Mr Hartuv said his government was furious with Mr Robertson 's remarks .
" We were due to sign a contract in the near future with Mr Roberson for the construction of a new Christian heritage centre in the Galilee , " he told the AFP news agency .
" We , as the State of Israel , cannot accept what he said and we will not do any business with him or with anyone else who agrees with his view . "
But Mr Hartuv insisted Israel had not rejected outright the idea of building the centre .
" The contract is still open - just not with Mr Robertson . "
" If there are other Christian leaders , they are most welcome to sign a contract to bring Christian tourists to the state of Israel . "
Mr Robertson is no stranger to controversy .
He was forced to apologise last year for calling for the assassination of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez .
His Bulgarian colleague brags that his country has the " prettiest Gypsies " and says he knows where to buy 12 - year - old Gypsy brides for " up to € 5,000 " ( £ 2,250 ) .
Then there is the Polish professor who uses public office to pay tribute to General Franco , the late Spanish dictator .
Or the intellectual strategist of an Austrian party whose ideology , according to a Vienna court , is similar to that of Hitler 's " national socialism " .
Such are the leading lights of " Europe of the Fatherlands " , the world of politically organised European far - right extremism who are expected to form their first transnational organisation next week by establishing a formal caucus in the European parliament .
The development is an early result of the accession of Romania and Bulgaria .
Ironically , given the hostility of the west European far right to expansion , to immigration , and to eastern Europe , it is Romania 's entry that has made the caucus possible : the EU parliament 's rules stipulate that an official caucus in the chamber needs to have representatives from at least five countries , and a minimum of 19 MEPs .
They now meet this requirement .
Efforts have been under way for years to increase the clout of the far right in Europe by pooling assets and resources .
The former pioneer of the modern European populist right , Jörg Haider of Austria , was wooed as a possible European leader .
But the plans foundered because of differences among the notoriously fractious national leaders .
These frictions remain .
Italy 's Northern League , for example , is boycotting the caucus because the league 's head , Umberto Bossi , cannot stand the leader of France 's National Front , Jean - Marie Le Pen .
" It 's pretty much watertight , although there are still a few imponderables , " the far - right Austrian MEP Andreas Moelzer told the Austrian press agency .
" We 've already got a common programme . "
The plan is to announce the creation of an official parliamentary caucus during the first session of the year on January 15 .
The caucus will bring together about 20 MEPs from at least six countries .
Mr Moelzer said the numbers could expand to 40 .
Ashley Mote , an MEP for south - east England who sits as an independent and was previously from the UK Independence party , is being mentioned as a member .
Bulgaria 's quota of European parliament seats includes one held by the extreme Ataka party of Volen Siderov , which campaigns against Gypsies or Roma and Turks , while Romania has supplied a breakthrough for the hard right by gaining five seats for Corneliu Vadim Tudor 's anti-Hungarian , anti-Semitic and anti-Roma Greater Romanian party .
The turnaround came last week when Mr Tudor said his delegates would join the new caucus , expected to be named either " Europe of the Fatherlands " or " Identity , Sovereignty , Tradition " .
The brains behind the new movement are Mr Moelzer , who was an ideologist for Mr Haider for years before falling out with him , and Frank Vanhecke , the leader of Vlaams Belang , Belgium 's separatist Flemish nationalist party .
Ironically , Mr Moelzer 's Austrian Freedom party voted against letting Romania join the EU .
Bruno Gollnisch , a French MEP and a deputy leader of Mr Le Pen 's National Front , is expected to lead the new group , with Mr Moelzer as its general secretary .
The members include Alessandra Mussolini , granddaughter of the Italian former fascist leader Benito , and Dimitar Stoyanov , a new Bulgarian MEP who circulated an email saying there were much " prettier Gypsies " in Bulgaria after a Hungarian Roma woman was named European MP of the year a few months ago .
" You can even buy yourself a loving [ Gypsy ] wife aged 12 or 13 ...
The best of are very expensive , up to € 5,000 each . "
Mr Gollnisch is awaiting a verdict from a Lyon court on charges of questioning the Holocaust .
Other possible members of the group include the League of Polish Families , a junior partner in Warsaw 's centre - right government , regularly accused of gay - bashing and anti-Semitism .
By establishing a formal caucus , the extreme right will benefit from greater EU funding .
A priority , said Mr Moelzer , will be to fight any German - led attempts to revive Europe 's comatose constitution .
In our previous article , How To Identify Unknown Processes In Windows we discovered how to identify and track down processes running on your Computer using Process Explorer .
Next , we 'll look at how to identify Network connections , known as TCP / IP ports , and how to find out who is connecting to your Computer .
What Are TCP / IP Ports ?
Webopedia defines TCP / IP Network ports as " an endpoint to a logical connection .
The port number identifies what type of port it is .
For example , port 80 is used for HTTP traffic . "
Think of ports and port numbers as how services enter your house , such as your phone , where the port is the box outside your house that connects the wires from the street and phone company to your house , and port number is your phone number .
If you stood on your roof and look down at your house , you will see all services entering and leaving your house from utilities and other companies that supply electric , gas , cable , etc .
With Computers , you can also " look down " and see all the logical Network connections communicating with your computer , by using a tool called TCPView for Windows located at Microsoft TechNet Windows Sysinternals website .
This tool is free and runs on Windows NT / 2000 / XP and Windows 98 / Me .
You can use TCPView on Windows 95 if you get the Windows 95 Winsock 2 Update from Microsoft .
Using TCPView
Once downloaded , unzip to a location on your PC and execute TCPview .exe .
You should see a screen similar to this :
TCPview will show you a detailed listings of all TCP ( Transmission Control Protocol ) and UDP ( User Datagram Protocol ) endpoints on your Computer , including the local and remote addresses and state of TCP connections .
On Windows NT , 2000 and XP , TCPView also reports the name of the process that owns the endpoint .
The first column displays the Process name ( on your Computer ) and the Local Address column shows your Computer name and the port number your Computer is listening on , while the Remote Address column will display the remote Computer name ( or IP Address if TCPview cannot resolve the IP address to it 's Domain name ) and the port number it is listening on .
As shown below , the Remote Address column is the key to who you are communicating and connected with .
In this case the Local Address is marklap Computer and it is connected to the Remote Address known as msgr-cs128.hotmail.com .
As described above , the Port makrlap is accepting the connection on is 2185 while msgr-cs128 is accepting the connection on 1863 .
So how do you know what kind of communications is going on between the two hosts ?
If you do not recognize the Process name , you can look up the Remote Address Port information for a list of well known common ports or here for a detailed list of well known ports .
In this case we will need to look up port 1863 using the detailed list , which is MSNP , known as Windows Messenger ( from Microsoft ) which provides Online Chat and Instant Messenger service .
TIP : If you did not know what MSNP was , search Google , but be carefull when searching , since a lot of results could mis-lead the meaning and lure you into buying software you do not need .
In this case , search at your Computer OS vendor web site for the information .
One of the reason I like TCPview is because it 's provides real - time activity .
You will notice when the Endpoints change state from one update to the next , it is highlighted in yellow .
Those that are deleted are shown in red , and new endpoints are shown in green .
Another reason , is that you can right click on a Process that has a connection to a Remote Address , select properties and do a WhoIS lookup for the remote host , as well as select Process Properties to display the Path and Command line information for the Process .
The number next to Process is the PID ( Process Identifier ) running on your PC .
TCPview also gives you the capability to end a process or close a connection .
An example of a WhoIS lookup :
Example of a Process properties :
Other tools exist that can provide the same or more information as TCPview .
With any tool you use , it is important that you understand what the data means and use the information to determine exactly who is connecting to you .
Armed with this knowledge , you can quickly identify unknown Network connections and never again wonder who is reaching into your Computer .

With Iraq , Afghanistan , Lebanon , and Palestine already in or sliding toward civil war , one can correctly label the Bush administration ’s foreign policy the most incompetent in recent memory .
But the problem lies deeper than that .
The hyperactive , and often counterproductive , U.S. foreign policy is a bipartisan problem , best illustrated by the sordid U.S. history in Somalia .
Ever since the Korean War , through Democratic and Republican administrations , the United States has pursued an interventionist policy abroad that is disconnected from the historical roots of its traditional foreign policy of military restraint overseas .
This traditional restraint , with lapses here and there , dominated U.S. foreign policy from the nation ’s founding until the Korean War .
In fact , by defending the then economically backward South Korea , which continues to have only limited strategic significance for the United States , Democrat Harry Truman became the first of a long line of consecutive activist presidents .
More recently , Bill Clinton was the modern - day champion for the greatest number of overseas interventions  meddling in Somalia , Haiti , North Korea , Bosnia , Iraq , Kosovo , Afghanistan , and Sudan .
While Clinton avoided blundering into a large quagmire on the ground , as the current Bush administration has done , his energetic foreign policy shows that the activist U.S. foreign policy transcends party lines .
U.S. policy in Somalia , across the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations , is a classic example of U.S. activism making things worse over time .
In the early 1990s , the administration of George H.W. Bush sent U.S. forces to Somalia to guard relief supplies from warring factions .
Although " mission creep "  the expansion of a mission once U.S. forces are on the ground  began to affect the operation in Somalia even before Clinton became president , he greatly exacerbated it .
Like the U.S. peacekeeping adventure in Lebanon in the early 1980s under President Ronald Reagan , the mission in Somalia expanded into fighting on one side of a civil war .
The result was also the same :
When a relatively small number of U.S. forces were killed , both Reagan and Clinton pulled the plug on the intervention , arguably leaving both countries worse off than when the United States arrived .
In Somalia , after the United States and United Nations forces left in 1994 , the country slid into an even worse civil war .
One of the factions in this internecine conflict was a radical Islamist contingent .
This faction did n’t get that much traction until the current Bush administration ordered the CIA to support the unpopular warlords against it .
Suddenly , the Islamists , called Islamic Courts Union ( ICU ) , became wildly popular and took over the southern part of the country , including the capital Mogadishu .
The ICU is sympathetic to al - Qaeda , harbors its followers , has forces that have been trained by the group , and is led by Hassan Dahir Aweys , who has links to al - Qaeda .
The United States , having largely created this disastrous situation , then exacerbated it .
The United States has been left supporting the weak and despised Somali government , which has been surrounded by the ICU ’s forces in the town of Baidoa .
The United States tacitly allowed the Ethiopian military , a traditional rival of Somalia , to send troops to shore up the precarious and fractious Somali government .
This action , of course , caused a " rally around the flag " effect in Somalia , with the radical ICU benefiting from the nationalist outpouring .
A visit by Gen. John Abizaid , the head of the U.S. Central Command , to Ethiopia also fueled this sentiment in Somalia .
In addition , jihadists from around the world may very well pour into the country to help Islamic Somalia fend off the " foreign aggression " of Ethiopia  as happened in the 1980s in Afghanistan after the Soviets attacked and more recently in Iraq after the United States invaded .
Furthermore , al - Qaeda could use its safe haven in Somalia to launch attacks on other countries , as it did when the friendly Taliban controlled Afghanistan .
If this is n’t bad enough , the Ethiopians ’ invasion of Somalia has caused Eritrea , another of their rivals , to provide the ICU with thousands of men to fight .
Many analysts now worry that a regional war could inflame the entire Horn of Africa .
The Nobel Prize - winning economist Friedrich Hayek once said that governments almost always do the wrong thing .
He was talking about the economic realm , but he could have also been talking about U.S. foreign policy toward Somalia during the George H.W. Bush , Clinton , and George W. Bush administrations .
Sometimes , doing nothing gets better results than counterproductive activism .
Flip - Flopping for Power
by James Ostrowski by James Ostrowski
Rudy Giuliani is back — with all the old arrogance , conceit , prickliness , and ambition for power .
Could n’t he have just retired into the sunset with all those profits he made off 9/11 ?
When 9/11 hit , Giuliani was a scandal - ridden , washed - up , former rogue prosecutor , soon to be ex-mayor with nowhere to go politically .
Then , on the way to his anti-terrorism headquarters in the World Trade Center — that ’s right , the World Trade Center — he got trapped in a building after the first tower collapsed .
Later , many of his firemen died due to outmoded radios .
His police helicopters were ordered away from the scene , apparently due to bureaucratic infighting .
A sorry performance by any standard .
Later that day , with heroic rescuers still anonymous , the nation needed a hero and Giuliani was handy with Bush on the run .
He does deserve credit for this role , but as Giuliani no doubt reminded many a defendant at sentencing time , the good you do does not erase the bad .
Eventually , though , Giuliani’s hat size expanded and he tried to stay on as Mayor even after his term was set to expire .
Geez , what a gargantuan ego .
Alas , Rudy , we hardly missed you .
Next , Giuliani profiteered off 9/11 with a book , lectures and a politically - connected security firm .
" Do n’t have your anti-terrorist command center inside the leading terrorist target on earth .
That ’ll be $ 50,000 . "
Then , he pops up at the Republican Infomercial the other night .
There is an " I " in team , according to Giuliani , whose remarks were seasoned with the " I " - word .
Giuliani offered a spirited defense of one of our worst presidents , a president who has failed in foreign policy , the economy and civil liberties , but done well in all other aspects of his administration such as having lunch with the Belizean Ambassador and reading to school children .
He excuses Bush for 9/11 by explaining that he had only been president for eight months .
He fails to mention that Bush had been repeatedly warned about bin Laden .
Giuliani dissertates about how terrorism had obviously been mishandled for many years but fails to explain why Bush and his team did nothing about this obvious policy lapse for eight months .
He also fails to mention that his former boss Ronald Reagan promised action against terrorism but funded the Mujahedeen .
Giuliani accuses John Kerry of flip - flopping , giving sparse examples .
Here ’s Giuliani ’s record : voted for McGovern ( 1972 ) ; worked for Ronald Reagan ( 1981 — 1989 ) ; ran as a Liberal for Mayor of New York City ( 1989 , 1993 , 1997 ) ; endorsed Mario Cuomo ( 1994 ) ; now endorses George W. Bush .
His whole career has been one long series of flip - flops for power .
One thing Giuliani does n’t flip - flop about is Israel , to which he repeatedly panders in his speech .
After all , Israel is America ’s most reliable ally in the Middle East .
I ca n’t for the life of me figure out why an " ally " with one of the top two armies in the world , and a mere 500 miles away , has contributed no troops to the Iraq War .
In any event , it takes great courage for a New York politician to be mindlessly pro-Israel .
He is right about one thing : " The hatred and anger in the Middle East arises from the lack of accountable governments . "
Two governments with superior military machines have been able to impose their wills on Middle East peoples who never voted in favor of such domination : the United States and Israel .
Giuliani boasts of Bush ’s war on global " terrorism . "
The problem is , neither Giuliani nor any other neocon is against terrorism ; they are only against " terrorism . "
That is , they are not against the systematic use of aggressive force or violence to achieve political ends ; they are merely against the use of such force by the private sector or by governments they do n’t like .
The leaders of democratic governments , no matter how many innocent people they kill , maim or torture , can never be called terrorists , by definition .
" Is n’t that special ? "
The " terrorism " that Giuliani complains of is often inspired by the terrorism that Giuliani , lawyer that he is , defines out of existence by word games .
However , not even the most brilliant lawyer by verbal gymnastics can define out of existence the real consequences of such blindness , hypocrisy , arrogance and self - destructiveness , as Giuliani himself found out on 9/11 when he was trapped in that building on Barclay Street .
So Rudy — take your 9/11 millions and run — as far away from us as you can .

Tax refunds sought by hundreds of thousands of poor Americans have been frozen and their returns labeled fraudulent , blocking refunds for years to come , the Internal Revenue Service 's taxpayer advocate told Congress today .
The taxpayers , whose average income was $ 13,000 , were not told that they were suspected of fraud , the advocate said in her annual report to Congress .
The advocate , Nina Olson , said her staff sampled suspected returns and found that , at most , one in five was questionable .
A computer program selected the returns as part of the questionable refund program run by the criminal investigation division of the Internal Revenue Service .
In some cases , the criminal division ordered that taxpayers be given no hint that they were suspected of fraud , the report said .
Most of the poor people whose returns the computer flagged as fraudulent were seeking the earned income tax credit , a benefit for the working poor .
The credit can return all of the income taxes and Social Security taxes withheld from the paychecks of poor people .
Without the credit , many poor people coming off welfare and going to work would receive less money because of taxes taken out of their paychecks and the loss of health benefits , I.R.S. data and other government documents show .
Olbermann just mentioned a " breaking story " that on Monday , the Air Force Times , the Navy Times , and Army Times will ALL call for Rumsfeld 's resignation .
I guess Tony Snow will call them democratic operatives ?
Here in VA , we have George Allen and Frank Wolf ( VA - 10 ) still saying he is doing , in effect , a heckuva job .

Reading the thread on global warming below , I see a common mistake that pops up in a lot of arguments at the intersection of science and policy .
With all due respect to the participants in the thread , they are largely talking past one another .
This often happens in arguments over global warming , and I think there 's a specific reason for it : there are really two separate questions in the global warming debate , and both sides tend to conflate the two , treating them as though they are the same issue with the same answer .
The thread below can really be thought of as two arguments :
Is human - caused global warming taking place ?
If human - caused global warming is taking place , what , if anything , should be done about it ?
Consider the two questions separately for a moment .
Is human - caused global warming taking place ?
There are two obvious answers to this question : yes or no .
It 's largely an empirical question , needing scientific inquiry .
If human - caused global warming is taking place , what , if anything , should be done about it ?
This question , which accepts that we are causing global warming , is more complex .
There are theoretically many answers , but policymakers and people who believe global warming is a serious problem tend to reduce it as though the answer were a simple dichotomy of 1 ) the government takes action , or 2 ) we do nothing .
The problem is , it 's easy to combine these two questions and their answers so that it seems as though a particular solution Y follows logically from a particular answer X , when this is really not the case at all .
It distorts the global warming debate so that it seems as though there is only one question :
Is human - caused global warming taking place ?
And the only answers are : No , and therefore we should do nothing , or Yes , and therefore the government needs to take action .
When the two essential questions in the global warming debate become tangled up in this way , those of us who oppose government action feel as though we are placed in an untenable position ; either we deny global warming is happening or we acknowledge that it is and therefore accept the necessity of government action .
I believe that when we allow the debate to be framed this way , we 're missing what 's really important , and we 're missing the opportunity to make a point that desperately needs making in the public arena .
For this purposes of this post , I 'm not going to take a position on whether or not humans are causing global warming .
But there is a position I can take : if global warming is real , government action is not the answer .
State action is too inefficient , too slow , too vulnerable to power - seeking and rent - seeking behavior , too apt to ignore the serious economic consequences of an action that has popular appeal .
I am indebted to Dan D'Amico for also making the vital point , in the context of criminal justice , that government is unable to accommodate citizens ' diverse preferences for the handling of large - scale societal problems .
That is why libertarians must disentangle the two questions above and stay focused on the one that is most important to us , the question of state action .
The presence and cause of global warming is a scientific question that will continue to be argued .
That is as it should be ; in science , complacency , the sense that we have all the answers , is always our enemy .
But the idea that government is the logical , best , and only answer to the largest - scale problems in society is so appealing that it is often treated as though it needs no debate .
It 's this idea , not the idea that we 're causing global warming , that is our enemy .
Sitting here at my laptop , I freely admit I do n't know the solution to global warming .
But that does not mean that millions upon millions of freely acting humans in a dynamic market cannot or will not produce one .
That is the central message , the one we need to keep in front of people .
If we can keep our eye on that , whichever way the debate goes , we will be ready .

The trajectory of a long - running campaign that gave birth this month to the preposterous all - party British parliamentary report into anti-Semitism in the UK can be traced back to intensive lobbying by the Israeli government that began more than four years ago , in early 2002 .
At that time , as Ariel Sharon was shredding the tattered remains of the Oslo accords by re-invading West Bank towns handed over to the Palestinian Authority in his destructive rampage known as Operation Defensive Shield , he drafted the Israeli media into the fray .
Local newspapers began endlessly highlighting concerns about the rise of a " new anti-Semitism , " a theme that was rapidly and enthusiastically taken up by the muscular Zionist lobby in the U.S .
It was not the first time , of course , that Israel had called on American loyalists to help it out of trouble .
In Beyond Chutzpah , Norman Finkelstein documents the advent of claims about a new anti-Semitism to Israel ’s lackluster performance in the 1973 Yom Kippur War .
On that occasion , it was hoped , the charge of anti-Semitism could be deployed against critics to reduce pressure on Israel to return Sinai to Egypt and negotiate with the Palestinians .
Israel alerted the world to another wave of anti-Semitism in the early 1980s , just as it came under unprecedented criticism for its invasion and occupation of Lebanon .
What distinguished the new anti-Semitism from traditional anti-Jewish racism of the kind that led to Germany ’s death camps , said its promoters , was that this time it embraced the progressive Left rather than the far Right .
The latest claims about anti-Semitism began life in the spring of 2002 , with the English - language Web site of Israel ’s respected liberal daily newspaper , Ha’aretz , flagging for many months a special online supplement of articles on the " New Anti-Semitism , " warning that the " age - old hatred " was being revived in Europe and America .
The refrain was soon taken up the Jerusalem Post , a right - wing English - language newspaper regularly used by the Israeli establishment to shore up support for its policies among Diaspora Jews .
Like its precursors , argued Israel ’s apologists , the latest wave of anti-Semitism was the responsibility of progressive Western movements  though with a fresh twist .
An ever present but largely latent Western anti-Semitism was being stoked into frenzy by the growing political and intellectual influence of extremist Muslim immigrants .
The implication was that an unholy alliance had been spawned between the Left and militant Islam .
Such views were first aired by senior members of Sharon ’s cabinet .
In an interview in the Jerusalem Post in November 2002 , for example , Benjamin Netanyahu warned that latent anti-Semitism was again becoming active :
" In my view , there are many in Europe who oppose anti-Semitism , and many governments and leaders who oppose anti-Semitism , but the strain exists there .
It is ignoring reality to say that it is not present .
It has now been wedded to and stimulated by the more potent and more overt force of anti-Semitism , which is Islamic anti-Semitism coming from some of the Islamic minorities in European countries .
This is often disguised as anti-Zionism . "
Netanyahu proposed " lancing the boil " by beginning an aggressive public relations campaign of " self - defense . "
A month later Israel ’s president , Moshe Katsav , picked on the softest target of all , warning during a state visit that the fight against anti-Semitism must begin in Germany , where " voices of anti-Semitism can be heard . "
But , as ever , the main target of the new anti-Semitism campaign were audiences in the U.S. , Israel ’s generous patron .
There , members of the Israel lobby were turning into a chorus of doom .
In the early stages of the campaign , the lobby ’s real motivation was not concealed : it wanted to smother a fledgling debate by American civil society , particularly the churches and universities , to divest  withdraw their substantial investments  from Israel in response to Operation Defensive Shield .
In October 2002 , after Israel had effectively reoccupied the West Bank , the ever reliable Abraham Foxman , director of the Anti-Defamation League , lumped in critics who were calling for divestment from Israel with the new anti-Semites .
He urged a new body established by the Israeli government called the Forum for Coordinating the Struggle Against Anti-Semitism to articulate clearly " what we know in our hearts and guts : when that line [ to anti-Semitism ] is crossed . "
A fortnight later Foxman had got into his stride , warning that Jews were more vulnerable than at any time since the Second World War .
" I did not believe in my lifetime that I or we would be preoccupied on the level that we are , or [ face ] the intensity of anti-Semitism that we are experiencing , " he told the Jerusalem Post .
Echoing Netanyahu ’s warning , Foxman added that the rapid spread of the new anti-Semitism had been made possible by the communications revolution , mainly the Internet , which was allowing Muslims to relay their hate messages across the world within seconds , infecting people around the globe .
It is now clear that Israel and its loyalists had three main goals in mind as they began their campaign .
Two were familiar motives from previous attempts at highlighting a " new anti-Semitism . "
The third was new .
The first aim , and possibly the best understood , was to stifle all criticism of Israel , particularly in the U.S.
During the course of 2003 it became increasingly apparent to journalists like myself that the American media , and soon much of the European media , was growing shy of printing even the mild criticism of Israel it usually allowed .
By the time Israel began stepping up the pace of construction of its monstrous wall across the West Bank in spring 2003 , editors were reluctant to touch the story .
As the fourth estate fell silent , so did many of the progressive voices in our universities and churches .
Divestment was entirely removed from the agenda .
McCarthyite organizations like Campus Watch helped enforce the reign of intimidation .
Academics who stood their ground , like Columbia University ’s Joseph Massad , attracted the vindictive attention of new activist groups like the David Project .
A second , less noticed , goal was an urgent desire to prevent any slippage in the numbers of Jews inside Israel that might benefit the Palestinians as the two ethnic groups approached demographic parity in the area know to Israelis as Greater Israel and to Palestinians as historic Palestine .
Demography had been a long - standing obsession of the Zionist movement : during the 1948 war , the Israeli army terrorized away or forcibly removed some 80 percent of the Palestinians living inside the borders of what became Israel to guarantee its new status as a Jewish state .
But by the turn of the millennium , following Israel ’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza in 1967 , and the rapid growth of the oppressed Palestinian populations both in the occupied territories and inside Israel , demography had been pushed to the top of Israel ’s policy agenda again .
During the second Intifada , as the Palestinians fought back against Israel ’s war machine with a wave of suicide bombs on buses in major Israeli cities , Sharon ’s government feared that well - off Israeli Jews might start to regard Europe and America as a safer bet than Jerusalem or Tel Aviv .
The danger was that the demographic battle might be lost as Israeli Jews emigrated .
By suggesting that Europe in particular had become a hotbed of Islamic fundamentalism , it was hoped that Israeli Jews , many of whom have more than one passport , would be afraid to leave .
A survey by the Jewish Agency taken as early as May 2002 showed , for example , that 84 percent of Israelis believed anti-Semitism had again become a serious threat to world Jewry .
At the same time , Israeli politicians concentrated their attention on the two European countries with the largest Jewish populations , Britain and France , both of which also have significant numbers of immigrant Muslims .
They highlighted a supposed rise in anti-Semitism in these two countries in the hope of attracting their Jewish populations to Israel .
In France , for example , peculiar anti-Semitic attacks were given plenty of media coverage : from a senior rabbi who was stabbed ( apparently by himself , as it later turned out ) to a young woman attacked on a train by anti-Semitic thugs ( except , as it later emerged , she was not Jewish and she faked the assault ) .
Sharon took advantage of the manufactured climate of fear in July 2004 to claim that France was in the grip of " the wildest anti-Semitism , " urging French Jews to come to Israel .
The third goal , however , had not seen before .
It tied the rise of a new anti-Semitism to the increase of Islamic fundamentalism in the West , implying that Muslim extremists were asserting an ideological control over Western thinking .
It chimed well with the post 9/11 atmosphere .
In this spirit , American Jewish academics such as Daniel Goldhagen characterized anti-Semitism as constantly " evolving . "
In a piece entitled " The Globalization of Anti-Semitism " published in the American Jewish weekly Forward in May 2003 , Goldhagen argued that Europe had exported its classical racist anti-Semitism to the Arab world , which in turn was re-infecting the West .
" Then the Arab countries re-exported the new hybrid demonology back to Europe and , using the United Nations and other international institutions , to other countries around the world .
In Germany , France , Great Britain , and elsewhere , today ’s intensive anti-Semitic expression and agitation uses old tropes once applied to local Jews  charges of sowing disorder , wanting to subjugate others  with new content overwhelmingly directed at Jews outside their countries . "
This theory of a " free - floating " contagion of hatred toward Jews , being spread by Arabs and their sympathizers through the Internet , media , and international bodies , found many admirers .
The British neoconservative journalist Melanie Philips claimed popularly , if ludicrously , that British identity was being subverted and pushed out by an Islamic identity that was turning her country into a capital of terror , " Londonistan . "
This final goal of the proponents of " the new anti-Semitism " was so successful because it could be easily conflated with other ideas associated with America ’s War on Terror , such as the clash of civilizations .
If it was " us " versus " them , " then the new anti-Semitism posited from the outset that the Jews were on the side of the angels .
It fell to the Christian West to decide whether to make a pact with good ( Judaism , Israel , civilization ) or evil ( Islam , Osama bin Laden , Londonistan ) .
We are far from reaching the end of this treacherous road , both because the White House is bankrupt of policy initiatives apart from its War on Terror , and because Israel ’s place is for the moment assured at the heart of the U.S. administration ’s neoconservative agenda .
That was made clear last week when Netanyahu , the most popular politician in Israel , added yet another layer of lethal mischief to the neoconservative spin machine as it gears up to confront Iran over its nuclear ambitions .
Netanyahu compared Iran and its president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , to Adolf Hitler .
" Hitler went out on a world campaign first , and then tried to get nuclear weapons .
Iran is trying to get nuclear arms first .
Therefore from that perspective , it is much more dangerous , " Netanyahu told Israel ’s anti-terrorism policymakers .
Netanyahu ’s implication was transparent : Iran is looking for another Final Solution , this one targeting Israel as well as world Jewry .
The moment of reckoning is near at hand , according to Tzipi Livni , Israel ’s foreign minister , who claims against all the evidence that Iran is only months away from possessing nuclear weapons .
" International terrorism is a mistaken term , " Netanyahu added , " not because it does n’t exist , but because the problem is international militant Islam .
That is the movement that operates terror on the international level , and that is the movement that is preparing the ultimate terror , nuclear terrorism . "
Faced with the evil designs of the " Islamic fascists , " such as those in Iran , Israel ’s nuclear arsenal  and the nuclear holocaust Israel can and appears prepared to unleash  may be presented as the civilized world ’s salvation .

3. Google will integrate YouTube into its main services .
YouTube will be promoted via the “ video ” tab on Google ’s home page .
YouTube will keeps its name and domain , but the business / sales end will be interchangeable .
Not long ago , we wrote a popular piece about UC - Berkeley 's iTunes initiative which , to sum it up , allows anyone , anywhere , to download complete university courses to their iPods for free .
Amazing .

例の富田メモの日付は1988年4月28日。昭和天皇の記者会見は4月25日ですが、この会見の模様が報道されたのは29日。
G - Search でキーワード 「 天皇 AND 記者会見 」 、日付「 19880425〜19880430」の検索結果は以下の通り。

これで全部です。全国紙は全て検索対象ですが、産経は1992年以降しかデータベース化されていないのでヒットしていません。
28日のメモは29日の報道を控えた確認作業か何かの際のメモかと思われますが、実際そういうことがあったのかどうかは未調査。
さて、例のメモは徳川侍従長の引退記者会見のメモではないかという説が流れていますが、28日にそのような会見はあったのでしょうか?
やはり G- Search で「徳川義寛」で検索したのですが、28日以降では上の検索結果に含まれるものしかありません。これは陛下の会見で徳川侍従長についてのやりとりがあるからです。
そこで検索範囲を広げたところ、こんな記事を見つけました。
毎日新聞 勇退の徳川侍従長が会見、昭和史のエピソードなどを語る 1988.04.12 東京夕刊 9 頁 社会 写図有 （ 全1,556字 ）
記事の冒頭を引用します。
勇退の徳川侍従長が会見、昭和史のエピソードなどを語る
1988.04.12 東京夕刊 9 頁 社会 写図有 ( 全 1,556 字 ) 宮中の生き字引、尾張徳川家の血筋、学者肌、頑固−−。様々な人物評を贈られた徳川義寛侍従長が半世紀を超える侍従生活に終止符を打つ。侍従に就任したのは２・２６事件の年の昭和十一年十一月。戦前、戦後の激動の中で、天皇、皇后両陛下の素顔に接し、皇室を支えてきた。次の侍従長は生っ粋の行政官。天皇の側近も大きく様変りする。
十二日午前の記者会見で徳川さんは「いつも陛下のおそばで教えていただいているうちに五十年がたってしまった」と退官に当たっての感想を語った。さらに「乾徳（けんとく）をつねに仰ぎてひたぶるに
仕へまつりぬこの五十年（いそとせ）を」と、今朝の心境を託した歌を披露した（乾徳とは天皇の徳の意味）。六十年十月、侍従長に就いた際「微風のような仕事をしたい」と述べたが、陛下の手術という “ 嵐”を無事乗り越え、皇居の新緑を渡る春風に送られて、昭和史のステージを去る。
徳川侍従長の会見は4月12日なのです。4月28日ではありません。なお、検索範囲は5月31日まで広げましたが、29日の陛下の会見記事以降は一つもヒットしていません。
つまり、徳川氏が28日に(なぜか)再び記者会見を行い、しかもそれが朝日・毎日・読売で一切報道されない(もしくは何者かの陰謀によりこの三紙のデータベースから報道されたはずの記事が消された!)と考えない限り、徳川侍従長の会見メモ説はありえません。
以上。
なお、この記事には徳川氏がA級戦犯合祀問題や陛下の靖国参拝問題について会見で触れたという記述は一切ありませんでした。勇退の経緯、結婚の思い出、在任中最も印象に残ったことを話したようです。
というわけで、この検索で既に1000円近く使ってますな。。。なお陛下の会見記事の全文はさすがに引用しませんが(してもいい気もするが)、既に2chあたりにはコピペされてるっぽい。読んでみるとわかりますが富田メモの解読された部分と符合する部分が多々あります。
David Halberstam 's death by car crash has the American mainstream media , The New York Times most especially , lighting funeral torches and sermonizing about Halberstam 's journalistic integrity and deep moral vision .
This is what happens when a senior scribe priest passes on , for it gives those still alive yet another opportunity to congratulate themselves for working in such an elevated profession as journalism .
And to a certain generation of writers , Halberstam was among the elevated elite .
Halberstam did little for me -- he was too middle - of - the - road for my taste , and helped to keep the present system of recording acceptable history well - oiled and intact .
I wrote about him once , during my brief gig with Ironminds , an online mag whose corporate backer , Novix Media , cheated many contributors before collapsing altogether .
I was hired to write about the social impact of sports ( alongside Filip Bondy of the New York Daily News ) , coming off the just - published " American Fan " and my appearances on dozens of sports radio shows nationwide .
I took a big swing at Halberstam in my first column , as well as at the top sportswriters of the time , figuring I should piss off as many mainstream sports aficionados as I could from the jump , just to clear the ground if nothing else ( such was my conceit in those innocent , pre -9/11 days ) .
But I never did get Halberstam to correct his flawed history lesson , not that I had a serious chance to begin with , but you take your shots when you can and see what sticks .
Here 's my take on Halberstam as it appeared in Ironminds , July 10 , 2000 .
The Vietnam War inspires revision .
After all , when you 've slaughtered millions of men , women and children , and bombed large parts of their country into moonscape , it 's best to dip the memories in bleach and hope the blood rinses away .
Such was the case during the 25th anniversary of the American pullout in April , a festival of revisionism on the order of MTV's Spring Break .
And now , on a smaller but no less important scale , we find a senior member of the sportswriting fraternity engaged in the same squalid enterprise .
David Halberstam is well regarded by his peers .
He has written about many topics during his illustrious career : civil rights , war , American politics and , of course , sports .
He is the author of " Playing for Keeps : Michael Jordan and the World He Made , " a companion volume of sorts to MJ 's own " For the Love of the Game : My Story , " a monument to self - love that recalls the Age of Pharaohs .
Halberstam 's effort is less grandiose than Jordan's , and this is what Halberstam 's partisans expect -- restraint , fairness , the ability to assess a subject in the proper light .
We can trust what Halberstam says .
They do n't give Pulitzers to just anyone .
In the July 2 New York Times Book Review , we find Halberstam assessing ( hell , celebrating ) Red Smith , one of the better stylists of sportswriting 's old guard .
Smith 's chief love was baseball .
He was there when the greats played the game .
He recorded the feats of Joe DiMaggio , Ted Williams and Jackie Robinson in cool , measured prose and served as an inspiration to a new generation of sportswriters , of which Halberstam was one .
With the release of " Red Smith on Baseball , " a long - awaited anthology of the late scribe 's best work , Halberstam falls to his knees and pays unlimited respect , gushing for paragraphs about the greatness of his hero .
Which is fine .
We all have our idols , I suppose , and Red Smith 's writing is far superior to that of Mike Lupica , Mitch Albom , Rick Reilly and Tony Kornheiser .
But that 's not enough for Halberstam .
After going on and on about Smith 's ability to capture the poetry of the national pastime and turn it into literature , he suddenly drags in Muhammad Ali as a prop to further glorify Smith : " When Cassius Clay embraced Islam , changed his name to Muhammad Ali and refused to serve in Vietnam , his actions outraged many sportswriters ; Smith wrote with sympathy of Ali , his talent and his integrity .
" This is , how you say , bullshit .
In fact , Smith was one of the outraged sportswriters .
He belittled Cassius Clay and openly hoped that Sonny Liston would pound the piss out of the brash young fighter .
When Clay defeated Liston , won the heavyweight title and shouted to the sportswriters who were ringside to eat their words , Smith hesitantly obliged in print and conceded that the taste was not to his liking .
When Clay became Ali and refused to help butcher Vietnamese , the pro-war Smith went nuts .
Here are two samples of his " sympathy of Ali , " omitted by Halberstam : " There are draft - dodgers in every war , and Clay is n't the only slacker in this one . " " Cassius makes himself as sorry a spectacle as those unwashed punks who picket and demonstrate against the war .
" Note , too , how Smith refused to call Ali by his Muslim name .
This was standard practice among those of Smith 's generation , with the exceptions of Howard Cosell and a young sportswriter for the New York Times , Robert Lipsyte , now one of the paper 's elders .
The documentary record shows that Smith was no fan of The Greatest ( indeed , when Joe Frazier beat Ali in 1971 , Smith practically choked with joy ) , and though he apparently softened his view in later years , Smith was one of the shriller voices of the media pack that hounded Ali when it mattered .
Halberstam surely knows this , so his attempt to exonerate Smith for mistreating Ali is especially dishonest .
One may think that Halberstam truly believes what he wrote , that it was not a crass attempt to beautify Smith 's ugly past .
After all , it 's become folk wisdom that the great Red Smith was nothing but supportive of Ali .
( Was n't everyone ? )
But one need only read Thomas Hauser 's " Muhammad Ali : His Life and Times " and David Remnick 's acclaimed " King of the World : Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American Hero " to discover the truth about Smith .
I 'm certain Halberstam has , which makes his little Red lie even more difficult to digest .
What is sake ?
Sake ( sah - keh ) is a fermented alcoholic beverage with a long history in Japanese culture .
While often called ‘ rice wine ’ sake is actually more like beer than wine as it is made from a grain , rice , not a fruit as wine is .
Sake is a fermented , but not distilled beverage , and should not be confused with shochu , another Japanese alcoholic beverage that is distilled .
The alcoholic content of sake is higher than beer , generally between 12 % and 18 % alcohol by volume , and has a complex , even fruity flavor when made by a high quality manufacturer .
Sake characteristics run the gamut from sweet to dry , fruity to earthy , with acidity and fragrance complexities that rival western wines .
Sake is far from a simple drink .
Hot Sake vs. Cold Sake
Historically , this beverage was served warm , and the reasons were twofold .
Firstly , this ancient drink was created before refrigeration and was therefore habitually served that way after methods to chill food and drink were developed .
Secondly , sake was also historically a much more coarse beverage , and often took up flavors from the wooden casks in which it was stored .
Many off flavors were also a side effect of the fermentation process , which were masked by serving it at a higher temperature .
More recently , better brewing techniques , more refined strains of yeast and koji , and modern storage practices have created a very different product than in the past .
A more refined product does not mean that all brands or styles are the same , however .
Just as western wines have subtle differences , so do sakes from different regions and different manufacturers .
In general , high quality variety is meant to be consumed cold , while lower quality one is drunk warm , which can hide off flavors that are created during the fermentation process of the cheaper brands .
That said , the peak flavor higher quality sakes can be achieved at subtly different temperatures , different for each brand .
To most people , this difference will not be noticeable ( similar to the many different kinds of tea , each of which has an ‘ optimal ’ brewing temperature ) .
But a general rule is that high quality sake should be served slightly chilled , but never too cold as many of the subtleties of the beverage may be muted when the drink is too cold .
There are a few decent types , however , that are meant to be served slightly warmed , and will be labeled as such , and can make a nice treat on a cold winter day , but as a general rule , higher quality sake should be served slightly chilled .
Milling The Rice – Making The Sake
Sake takes approximately one month to make and is consumed rather quickly after being aged about six months to smooth out its flavor .
It will not improve with longer aging as will some traditional western wines .
Rice used in the production is polished , or ‘ milled , ’ removing much of the outer coating .
In fact , in some premium sakes , as much as 65 % of the grain is milled away , leaving only a small amount of the grain to be used in production .
The degree of milling will greatly influence the quality of the final product , and there are five designations for sake , depending on the degree of milling and additives in the final product .
Junmai - shu :
This is a ‘ pure ’ sake with no distilled alcohol added as a finishing ingredient .
Traditionally , 30 % of the grain had to be milled away for this designation , however recently the laws have changed and there are no longer any milling requirements , only that no alcohol may be added to the product .
This is a ‘ pure ’ sake with no distilled alcohol added as a finishing ingredient .
Traditionally , 30 % of the grain had to be milled away for this designation , however recently the laws have changed and there are no longer any milling requirements , only that no alcohol may be added to the product .
Honjozo - shu :
This style has had at least 30 % of the grain milled away and a modicum of alcohol has been added during finishing .
: This style has had at least 30 % of the grain milled away and a modicum of alcohol has been added during finishing .
Ginjo - shu :
This style has had 40 % of the grain milled away and may or may not have alcohol added during the finishing .
If bottle is labeled Ginjo , it indicates that distilled alcohol was added and if it is labeled Junmai Ginjo , it means there was no alcohol added .
: This style has had 40 % of the grain milled away and may or may not have alcohol added during the finishing .
If bottle is labeled , it indicates that distilled alcohol was added and if it is labeled , it means there was no alcohol added .
Daiginjo - shu :
This sake style has had 50 % of the grain milled away and also may or may not have had alcohol added during finishing .
If bottle is labeled Daiginjo , it indicates that distilled alcohol was added and if it is labeled Junmai Daiginjo , it means there was no alcohol added .
: This sake style has had 50 % of the grain milled away and also may or may not have had alcohol added during finishing .
If bottle is labeled , it indicates that distilled alcohol was added and if it is labeled , it means there was no alcohol added .
Namazake :
This is actually a special designation that means that the sake was not pasteurized before bottling .
Sake is generally pasteurized to kill any bacteria or mold that may contaminate or ruin the final product in some way .
It also serves to deactivate certain enzymes that may change the characteristics of the sake ( for better or worse ) before it reaches the consumer .
How Sake is Made
Sake production is a complex undertaking .
First the rice is milled , as mentioned above .
It is then washed , soaked , and rinsed to remove any particulate matter ( called nuka ) that may be clinging to the grains .
The rice is then steamed to the proper consistency for the fermentation , as the rice will be fully cooked yet still slightly firm .
Half of the rice is placed into a large vat and the other half is reserved to create the starter , with a special mold called koji sprinkled into it when it has cooled .
This will be used to convert the starches in the rice to sugar for fermentation .
Over the course of three to four days , the koji starter is mixed and carefully watched .
When ready , a portion of the the koji starter is mixed with a portion of the remaining cooked rice , and water and yeast is added .
Fermentation takes place over the next few weeks as more rice , water and koji starter are mixed in over three successive stages .
When the mash ( as the fermenting mix is called ) has reached the point of perfection ( a judgment that is more art than science and generally done by very experienced individuals ) the resulting product is pressed to separate the liquid from the solids .
Traditionally , this was done by hand using large canvass bags , however now is mostly done by machines .
The resulting liquid is then filtered and pasteurized .
The sake is generally aged six months , after which it is blended and often water is added to achieve the proper level of alcohol by volume .
It is then bottled .
Some sake is actually not filtered and contains some of the lees ( sediment ) and is called nigori- zake ( cloudy sake ) usually labeled as pearl in western countries .
Sake may sound like a simple product , rice , water and yeast , however the slightest change to the process can make a world of difference .
The source of the rice is crucial to the consistency of the product .
And variation in the koji production , or the temperature of the fermentation can also result in a drastically different profile .
The process of making this delectable beverage is truly an art that has evolved over the centuries , and continues to progress even today .
Just as varietal wines from different regions and grape types can display vastly different characteristics , so can sake from different regions and manufacturers .
It is well worth the effort of anyone who likes sake to explore the many different sakes available .
What 's cooler than seeing a giant sea turtle up close in the wild ?

This shot required the makers of Deep Sea 3D to lug a special 1,200 - pound stereo-vision camera 150 feet below the surface .
Going to such extreme measures has helped recent Imax releases snap up box office returns that rival those of Hollywood pictures .
The prequel to Deep Sea , Into the Deep , cost less than $ 5 million to produce , and has grossed $ 69 million in its 11 - year run .
Overall , Imax revenue jumped 35 percent last year ( compare that with Hollywood 's 6 percent drop in box office ) .

Social Implications of Keysigning
Raven & Jericho
Tue May 23 01:41:20 EDT
2006
Intro
The use of strong public encryption has always been popular among geeks .
Perhaps the most commonly used and most beloved encryption for e-mail is Pretty Good Privacy ( PGP ) ; started as a free method for protecting emails or other sensitive information , later turned into a cornerstone for a large company .
As PGP became more corporate , costly and used patented algorithms , another project , GnuPG , sprung up to continue to offer strong encryption to the masses .
One foundation of reliable encryption is trust .
The use of encryption between two or more people relies on you being sure that the message you sent is properly encrypted to and able to be decrypted solely by the intended recipient .
When using a friend 's GPG key , you must be sure that the key was created by and belongs solely to your friend .
Otherwise , you may send mail that your friend cannot read ( if they do n't have the key you encrypted to ) , or worse , mail that some other party can read ( if that party does have the key you encrypted to ) .
Background
When exchanging encryption keys , establishing identity or verifying trust , there are multiple methods available .
For casual conversation with a friend that has a new ICQ or AIM ID , this may be as simple as sharing an inside joke that only the two of you would understand .
If the line of communication is more serious then a phone call , fax , or snail mail can be used to further verify the sender is who you believe it to be .
Another method developed to help establish the trust of encryption keys and identity is known as keysigning .
Quoting the GnuPG Keysigning Party HOWTO :
1.2
What is key signing ?
Key signing is act of digitally signing a public key and a userid packet which is attached to that key .
Key signing is done to verify that a given user id and public key really do belong to the entity that appears to own the key and who is represented by the user id packet .
You can digitally sign your own public key and an associated id on that key , or another entity 's public key and associated public key packet .
In a sense , key signatures validate public keys .
In recent years , keysigning parties have become more and more popular .
Many security conventions have hosted keysigning parties that allow everyone to gather in one place , verify identity , and sign each other 's keys on the spot .
Conventions like Black Hat Briefings and Defcon still host such gatherings while conferences like Usenix will no longer offer keysigning service .
While Usenix conferences will still offer keysigning sessions , their choice to drop this activity lies with technical and managerial decisions , not reasons outlined in this article .
Foundation of Trust
The keysigning protocol is based on multiple levels of trust that can be illustrated by a fictional example with two persons of interest .
The well known hacker / security conference ' ImaCon ' draws a mix of people from all aspects of the security world .
Attending this year are Raven and John E. Richo who have never met , but had occasional dialogue via e-mail and extensive communication via jabber .
They plan to meet in person at Lyger 's Pub to discuss some ideas for security research in person .
After meeting and talking , they end the night by digitally signing each other 's GPG keys for future secure communication , establish backup methods for contact , and go their separate ways .
During the convention , both have their key signed by a variety of other people ranging from casual friends to business aquaintances .
The convention ends without the destruction of the hotel and everyone leaves knowing more about their profession than they did days before .
Months go by before Raven receives a peculiar e-mail from John asking about work they had discussed extensively months before .
A few confused e-mails and one phone call later , both are stunned when John learns that Raven signed ' his ' GPG key , despite John never having used GPG .
Almost a year before , someone pretending to be John had intercepted and replied to a few e-mails of Raven's .
Unsure of his ability to keep intercepting the mail , he quickly suggested they move discussion to jabber and created a new ID to keep up the appearance of John .
Months of chatting and an enjoyable night of drinks and discussion later , a deep sense of trust had been established between the two , and John never really entered the picture at all .
Even with ' his ' name , supposed phone number , pictures and more , the trust was built up slowly and steadily .
By the end of this trust building , the person who had hijacked John 's identity was able to get Raven ( and others ) to sign his key with high certainty that he was the real John E. Richo .
Once that key was distributed to keyservers around the world , the potential for harm was strong .
John 's digital identity had in effect been hijacked .
Issues
The information disclosed by the key signatures you receive may sometimes have unintended consequences .
While not a serious issue to many people using PGP / GPG , this may manifest itself into situations of information disclosure that you may not be aware of .
With the rise of social networks such as Orkut and friendster there is clearly interest and potential value in identifying and aligning yourself with social circles .
For most people this is not a concern as it offers no downside or repercussions .
For some , it could present a serious issue down the road including hurting credibility ( regardless of social circle ) , disclosing social patterns offline such as meetings that were not announced , disclosing approximate geographical location and more .
There are a few basic truths to the use of PGP / GPG keysigning that one must consider .
Individuals choose what name and email address are attached to keys .
Some people use it in a professional capacity and as such have their legal name and work address attached .
Other people may use it in a personal capacity , including individuals that wish to hide information for personal reasons such as a fundamental desire for privacy , to hide questionable material or legal reasons .
Many people do n't want their legal identity attached to their key .
How then does " Raven " or " Jericho " prove who they are ?
Handles do not lend themselves well to the protocol and typically add extra hurdles in establishing trust .
Despite that , over half the people we know use handles instead of legal names for their keys .
In the most simple terms , signing someone else 's PGP / GPG key establishes a tie between you and that person .
The strength of this tie is not generally known from the signature and any assumptions about the ties are just that ... assumptions .
One strength and value of public key cryptography is the ability to make your key available to anyone and everyone , often via e-mail footers , web pages or public key servers .
You have little to no control over who signs your key .
Social Network Mapping
By examining a person 's key and taking it one step farther , you can create a list of people that have presumably interacted with them .
Following the links and checking other people 's keys will link to more people , allowing you to form a crude mapping of these links .
Once you follow enough links and connect the people , interesting groupings may begin to appear .
From this example of a signed key link chart , a couple groupings begin to emerge showing the beginnings of social circles .
In conjunction with browsing web pages , focused searches and a little common sense , it is possible to start making some logical guesses about social interaction , trust and other points of interest .
With this diagram , we can observe the following and make a few guesses :
The grouping around Jericho are mostly other attrition staff / volunteers Jericho / Forno run machines on the same network , likely they have met or live (d ) in the same area Sullo / Jake / Jericho link to each other , the three primary names attached to the OSF / OSVDB Jake 's only other links are to real names .
The e-mail addresses attached to those keys show where he likely works Forno / Jericho share common friends , may indicate a social club , mail list or informal grouping Greg links to an odd key that is connected to a government agency Raven may volunteer for OSF / OSVDB based on the link to Jake and advocacy for open source projects Raven 's social circle is segregated from the few links she has , suggesting division between personal and professional / technical friends
While all of these conclusions are logical , they rely on additional research above and beyond key linking , and they are all speculation .
It is often difficult to establish if a link is personal or professional or both .
The use of nicknames and handles on the net is not strictly limited to the darker side of things .
Due to the nature of instant messenger software and e-mail services , there is significant encouragement to use a nickname or variations on just a first name .
Add to that the fascination with adding a sense of mystery or intrique , and Bob becomes bowman14 while Jill becomes v1xen .
Both may work at the same office , live very straight lives and never consider anything shady or questionable .
Yet both have handles and may use encryption for work sensitive material .
Tarnishing Reputation
The good part about public key cryptography is that you can share your key with the world to be signed and validated .
The bad part about public key cryptography is that you can share your key with the world to be signed and stamped .
Since you can't prevent someone from signing your key and uploading their signature , you can't stop bad people from associating themselves with you and fronting some level of trust , even if it is n't present .
In this context , the bad people are those who do n't like you and may seek to discredit you , nothing more .
As a hacker , your word and your reputation are important .
Without trust and / or technical skill , other hackers wo n't share information or tools with you .
As a clean - cut chief security officer , your reputation and ethics make up your integrity , and your integrity helps to sell you to your employer .
If the hacker or CSO were discovered to have ties to the ' wrong ' people , it could severely hamper their ability to do their job .
Imagine if the hacker suddenly had his public key signed by a dozen law enforcement officers and the CSO found his key flooded with questionable hacker signings .
Sound improbable or pointless ?
It is n't .
This type of virtual smear campaign has already been used against people in the security industry and by law enforcement to cast doubt on the reputation of hackers , with some success .
Alienating someone via perceived reputation and ' guilt by association ' are powerful weapons .
Once done , you are essentially stuck with the virtual baggage until you revoke your key and cut a new one .
Beyond the Virtual Divide
The nature of PGP / GPG and keysigning is to maintain a system for digital trust .
While some of that trust may derive from activity or history that originates offline , the primary purpose is maintaining privacy and security in communication online .
As such , having that system potentially reveal information that transcends into the real world is a potentially serious threat .
When a keysigning occurs , it is typically done under a high level of trust .
Such trust often occurs when two people meet face to face , leaving little doubt as to who the key belongs to .
With the internet being a global entity , it is n't easy for two people to meet just to sign each other 's encryption keys .
This lead to organized meetings , typically targets of opportunity , where many people would gather to sign each other 's keys while participating in another event such as a technical conference .
Some of the bigger conferences will host keysigning parties that number in the hundreds .
These events are well established , well known and a matter of public record .
Obviously , if you sign someone 's key while a conference is going on , it is fairly safe to assume that you were present .
Branch out a bit , and begin to track the keysignings of entire circles of friends , taking particular note of the timestamps of each signature .
If you notice one key was signed by a dozen people on a given date , and received no signatures for a month before or after , it is likely he was in the company of many people on that date .
Does it correspond with any well known events such as security conferences or 2600 / B411 meetings ?
From our example analysis above , we can see routine key signings throughout the year .
The first small spike in January may correspond with a smaller meeting such as 2600 , B411 or DC Groups .
Jump to mid April and the big spike happens to correspond with the yearly AttCon held in Denver .
In August we see another big spike that corresponds with the yearly Blackhat / Defcon conferences .
In December , there is another big spike but does n't match any public conferences that we can find .
What happened during that time to warrant so many key signatures ?
This could be indicative of a private conference / gathering ?
Perhaps some other type of meeting such as a Linux user group ( LUG ) , USENIX meeting or NANOG keysigning ?
Or something else of interest .. does this correspond with a law enforcement seminar at Quantico or a regional Electronic Crimes Task Force meeting ?
Continuing the data mining , it becomes easy to use Google to figure out a little bit about a person .
Add that data to where they likely traveled based on key signatures , and you have a good foundation for mapping their travel , social circles , business colleagues and more .
Split Personality
For those that opt to walk the line between black and white hat , or comfortably live in the colorful world of the grey hat , they may choose to maintain multiple keys .
One may be kept under their long time alias while another maintained under their real name for business purposes .
If the masses do not know that ' Jericho ' is the same person as ' Brian ' , it behooves me to keep the identities separate .
Maintaining this separation is technically easy , but often difficult as the human nature tends to forget about the separation .
All it takes is one slip up and it can become trivial to link two distinct personalities to the same person .
Encryption keys are one of many avenues to help you figure out if different personalities are really the same individual .
When examining the signatures on a key , consider that a good friend may sign both of your keys .
Alone , this means that the person seems to know and trust two separate people .
Raven ->
Jericho
Raven ->
Brian
If the same thing occurs with a dozen people , it may be a bit suspicious .
Consider two keys from what are assumed to be two separate people ( Jericho and Brian ) that share twelve out of fifteen signatures .
Jericho's key has three signatures all from people operating under an alias .
Brian 's key has three signatures all from people operating under their full legal name .
Even with the three key signature discrepancy , it is safe to assume these two people run in the same circles and may very likely be the same person operating under two identities .
Add in the previous data analysis and notice that the signatures all occured on dates that show they were in the same places at the same time , and it becomes more and more probable that you have cross linked a real name to an alias .
Conclusion
While the social implications of PGP keysigning are not as groundbreaking or sexy as cracking strong encryption , the nature of these risks tend to have a significant impact none the less .
Passive information disclosure via social networking analysis is not a new concept .
Just recently the National Security Agency was found to be using millions of phone records for social networking analysis .
This type of data mining is not new by any means , but the analysis of different data is leading to more advanced relationship modeling that can pose a serious threat to your privacy .
By all means , continue to use strong encryption to protect your communication .
Just do so with the knowledge that your security may lead to insecurity .

Mr. Annan , the United Nations secretary general , said in Brussels today that any force must have a different set of instructions from the current , toothless United Nations peacekeeping force , which is still in the southern Lebanon .
“ It is urgent that the international community acts to make a difference on the ground , ” Mr. Annan said .
Giora Eiland , until recently Israel ’s national security adviser , said an international force would not be in Israel ’s interest if it only acted as a buffer .
It can only be effective , he said , “ if the other side does not want any provocation and wants to maintain quiet ” and “ if there ’s a credible address on the other side , ” with control over Lebanon .
He said Israel should insist that any international force “ make it possible for Lebanon to do what it has to do and not be a buffer between us and them , which would reduce the Lebanese government ’s responsibility . ”
On a visit to Haifa , to a house struck the day before , the former Israeli prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , now in opposition , compared the current conflict to the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 .
When Soviet missiles were aimed at the United States , he said , “ President Kennedy had one policy : Remove the threat , remove the missiles .
That should be our policy , and I believe it is , and we support it wholeheartedly . ”
Iran , which set up Hezbollah in 1982 to fight Israel , has said that it will not accept the disarming and dismantling of the militant group .
A senior Iranian politician , Gholam Ali Hadad - Adel , who is the president of the Iranian Parliament , told a rally in Tehran that Israelis should “ flee occupied Palestine . ”
He called Israel “ this filthy tumor ” that “ lies in the body of the Islamic world , ” and he warned the United States that so long as Israel exists , “ Muslims will not stop hating America . ”

Among the attacks in Lebanon today , a convoy of medical goods donated by the United Arab Emirates was hit in the Bekaa valley near Zahle , a mostly Christian town on one of the few open roads linking Syria and Beirut .
Two trucks were destroyed and their drivers killed .
Further proof of that here :
“ You ’re going to be up against people who have an opinion , a modem , and a bathrobe .

Google reached an agreement today to acquire DoubleClick , the online advertising company , from two private equity firms for $ 3.1 billion in cash , the companies announced , an amount that was almost double the $ 1.65 billion in stock that Google paid for YouTube late last year .
The sale offers Google access to DoubleClick ’s advertisement software and , more importantly , its relationships with Web publishers , advertisers and advertising agencies .
For months , Google has been trying to expand its foothold in online advertising into display ads , the area where DoubleClick is strongest .
Google made its name and still generates most of its revenue from search and contextual text ads .
DoubleClick , which was founded in 1996 , provides display ads on Web sites like MySpace , The Wall Street Journal and America Online as well as software to help those sites maximize ad revenue .
The company also helps ad buyers — advertisers and ad agencies — manage and measure the effectiveness of their rich media , search and other online ads .
House easily passes anti-terror bill WASHINGTON ( AP )  Anti-terror legislation sailed through the House on Tuesday , the first in a string of measures designed to fulfill campaign promises made by Democrats last fall .
Patterned on recommendations of the commission that investigated the Sept. 11 attacks , the far - reaching measure includes commitments for inspection of all cargo carried aboard passenger aircraft and on ships bound for the United States .
The vote was a bipartisan 299 - 128 .
" Our first and highest duty as members of this Congress is to protect the American people , to defend our homeland and to strengthen our national security , " said Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D - Md. Several Republicans criticized the legislation as little more than political posturing in the early hours of a new Democratic - controlled Congress .
Democrats want to " look aggressive on homeland security .
This bill will waste billions of dollars , and possibly harm homeland security by gumming up progress already underway , " said Rep. Hal Rogers , R - Ky .
In a written statement , the Bush administration listed several objections and said it could not support the measure as drafted but stopped short of a veto threat .
Democrats have pledged to make fiscal responsibility a priority in the new Congress , but they advanced the bill — their first of the year — without even a bare - bones accounting of the estimated cost .
The funding will require follow - up legislation .
Legislation introduced in the Senate a year ago to implement the recommendations of the 9/11 commission had a price tag of more than $ 53 billion over five years .
The terrorism legislation is the first of six measures the House is expected to pass as Democrats work to get off to a quick start .
Next up is an increase in the minimum wage — set for passage on Wednesday — followed by relaxation of the limits on stem cell research conducted with federal funds and a measure directing the administration to negotiate with drug companies for lower prices for Medicare recipients .
Next week , the Democrats intend to clear legislation to cut the interest rate on student loans and to curtail tax breaks for the energy industry .
Each of the six bills would go to the Senate , and it could be months — if then — before they reach the White House .
Already , President Bush has signaled he would veto the stem cell bill , which is opposed by abortion foes .
House supporters of the measure conceded at a news conference during the day that they do not have the two - thirds support needed to override a veto .
Depending on the outcome of that struggle , said Sen. Arlen Specter , R - Pa. , " 400,000 embryos will either be wasted or utilized to cure a disease . "
The House labored over the terrorism bill as the Senate began work on legislation enacting stricter ethics rules — and Democrats continued to gain from last fall 's elections .
Officials said that four of Bush 's controversial appeals court appointees , their chances for confirmation doomed in the Democratic - controlled Senate , would not be renominated .
The four are William Haynes , William Myers , Terrence Boyle and Michael Wallace , all of whom were prevented from coming to votes last year when the Senate was under Republican control .
" The president is disappointed in this inaction and hopes that the days of judicial obstructionism are beyond us , " said Dana Perino , deputy White House spokeswoman .
Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , saw it differently .
" Democrats stand ready to work with the administration to confirm judges who are not extremists , either left or right , " he said .
In the House , the anti-terror bill was fraught with political symbolism .
Democrats said it would enact virtually all of the unfulfilled recommendations of the 9/11 commission , and several members of the rank and file remarked that Republicans had failed to do so in five years since planes slammed into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and scarred the Pennsylvanian countryside .
" Do n't be fooled by those who say that this bill is moving too quickly , " said Rep. Bennie Thompson , D - Miss .
" It has been five years since 9/11 .
It has been three years since the 9/11 commission issued its report . "
" The fact is that the bipartisan 9/11 commission gave the last Congress F's and D's in implementing its recommendations , " said Rep. Jim Moran , D - Va .
" This Congress is determined to earn its A's in implementing its recommendations . "
Rep. John Mica , R - Fla. , noted disapprovingly that screeners at the Transportation Security Agency would receive collective bargaining rights under the bill .
And Rep. Peter King , R - N.Y. , said the measure " gives false hope to the American people " because technology for scanning all cargo containers is not yet available .
The legislation directs the Homeland Security Department to establish a system for inspecting all cargo carried on passenger aircraft over the next three years .
It also requires scanning of all containers bound for the U.S. , using the best available technology .
Large ports would be given three years to comply , smaller ports five years .
While much of the debate revolved around the provisions dealing with cargo , the bill also requires the government to take the risk of terror attacks into greater account when distributing homeland security grants to the 50 states .
The measure also would centralize the government 's efforts at preventing nuclear weapons from falling into the hands of terrorists and would take steps to disrupt the black market for nuclear material .
" We will not be safe here as long as the worst weapons can fall into the worst hands , " said Rep. Rick Larsen , D - Wash .
The measure also establishes a new program of grants to make sure local governments can communicate effectively in the event of a crisis .
One of the tragedies of 9/11 was the deaths of New York firefighters who were trapped inside the World Trade Center and could not hear urgent warnings to evacuate that were broadcast on police radios .
A companion measure , to establish a new House subcommittee with jurisdiction over intelligence matters , cleared on a vote of 239- 188 .

Modern advertisers only know how to do two things well .
Interrupt .
And slap ads on stuff .
Radio , TV , toilet stalls , foreheads .
Nothing is sacred .
The problem is that we now hate ads .
Fortunes are being made helping us to avoid being bothered .
TiVo , Satellite Radio , Pop - Up Stoppers were all created to help us enjoy the experience …
Without commercial interruption .
But the creatives insistence at not being creative have bought about another problem as well .
They are destroying viable consumer products and services people actually enjoy because they can't slap an ad on them .
Discussions are going on all over the net about monetizing the new networks .
My favorite doomsday advocate Scott Karp thinks we are all just going to go broke .
No way .
A country that has figured out how to sell to folks in the relative privacy of a bathroom stall should be able to figure out how to sell to folks hanging out on MySpace .
Let 's use Reddit for an example .
reddit is a source for what 's new and popular on the web — personalized for you .
Your votes train a filter , so let reddit know what you liked and disliked , because you 'll begin to be recommended links filtered to your tastes .
All of the content on reddit is submitted and voted on by users like you .
Now many folks quibble because Reddit does n't have a business model .
What that basicly means is that there is not place to slap ads without interupting the experience .
Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian have created something very successful but since the creatives can't figure out how to sell stuff without slapping on an ad and interupting the experience , the guys have to hope that some big company buys them out so they can last long enough for the people who want to sell stuff to get their act together .
Of course there are many ways to monetize Reddit .
Really .
Here 's one off the top my head :
Make the ads just like the content users put up .
Folks can vote them up or down and comment on them .
The seller not only reaches an active audience but also get comments about their product or service .
Might work .
Might not .
I 'm sure some ad guru can come up with an even better idea .
If we can get him off the toilet .

The government has told internal security forces to step up their scrutiny of the movement , claiming that the Scientologists , which they label a cult , are seeking to take advantage of Germany 's ailing education system as a means to recruit children .
It has prompted US embassy officials to lobby the German government on the sect 's behalf .
Police and intelligence agencies have been closely following the activities of the group .
State security and educational officials have issued warnings to schools and parents that seemingly innocuous tutoring programmes may be fronts to recruit children and their families .
Scientology - affiliated tutoring programmes have more than tripled in the past 12 months , and there are now estimated to be at least 30 nationwide .
' We know that Scientology is trying to approach students to gain followers , ' said Bavarian Interior Minister Gunther Beckstein , who said there were at least eight tutoring programmes connected to Scientology in Bavaria .
Scientology has the legal right to operate as a religion in Germany , though the government has refused it tax - exempt status .
' Scientology is not a religion .
It is a business and its aim is to gain power over individuals and try to brainwash them , ' Beckstein added .
' We see it as the duty of the state to inform students and parents about the danger of these schools . '
Scientology spokeswoman Sabine Weber said the group was a religious one being persecuted and that fears about tutoring and brainwashing were ' pure invention ' .
She said she was aware of only one case of a teacher using tutoring as a means to conversion .
' This goes against Scientology doctrine , ' she added .
The Church of Scientology , founded by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard , has celebrity adherents including Tom Cruise , John Travolta and Isaac Hayes .
It has a reputation for being secretive , wealthy and extremely aggressive in repelling critics .
While it claims to have 10 million members worldwide , independent experts estimate the number as closer to 100,000 .
Answering a question that has lingered for centuries , a team of scientists has proved that chemicals used to treat the wood used in Stradivarius and Guarneri violins are the reasons for the distinct sound produced by the world - famous instruments .
The conclusions , published in the current issue of Nature magazine , have confirmed 30 years of work into the subject by Joseph Nagyvary , professor emeritus of biochemistry at Texas A&M University , who was the first to theorize that chemicals – not necessarily the wood – created the unique sound of the two violins .
Nagyvary teamed with collaborators Joseph DiVerdi of Colorado State University and Noel Owen of Brigham Young University on the project .
“ This research proves unquestionably that the wood of the great masters was subjected to an aggressive chemical treatment and the chemicals – most likely some sort of oxidizing agents – had a crucial role in creating the great sound of the Stradivarius and the Guarneri , ” Nagyvary says .
“ Like many discoveries , this one could have been accidental .
Perhaps the violin makers were not even aware of the acoustical effects of the chemicals .
Both Stradivari and Guarneri wanted to treat their violins to prevent worms from eating away the wood .
They used some chemical agents to protect the wood from worm infestations of the time , and the unintended consequence from these chemicals was a sound like none other , ” he adds .
The team tested several instruments , including violins and cellos , produced by Stradivari and Guarneri from 1717 to around 1741 , using spectra analysis and other methods .
The results and those previously reported by Nagyvary showed that two specific areas of the instruments accounted for their unique sound – chemicals used in the varnish and fillers of the instruments , and the overall wood treatment process used by Stradivari and Guarneri .
“ This is highly gratifying for me , because it proves what I first proposed 30 years ago – that the chemicals used to treat instruments and not the unadulterated wood itself – were the reasons for the great sound of these instruments , ” Nagyvary explains .
“ I was criticized and ridiculed when I made these claims , and to have undeniable scientific proof that I was correct is very satisfying , to say the least . ”
Antonio Stradivari ( 1644 to 1737 ) made about 1,200 violins in his lifetime and kept a large inventory of them , and would only sell one when he was ready to part with it .
Today , there are only about 600 Stradivarius violins remaining and they are valued at up to $ 5 million each .
Although lesser known , Guarneri del Gesu was a contemporary of Stradivari and his instruments are considered equal in quality and price by experts .
Nagyvary , a native of Hungary who learned to play the violin by using an instrument that once belonged to Albert Einstein , has wondered for years how Stradivari , who could barely read and had no scientific training , could have produced instruments with such a pristine sound .
“ I started researching this in the early 1970s and from the beginning , I was convinced that the chemicals used to treat the instruments were the real key , not the wood itself , ” he says .
There is still a missing piece of the puzzle , Nagyvary believes .
“ The next step is to identify the chemical agents involved .
To do that , more precious wood samples are needed , ” he adds .
“ But in the past , there has been a lack of cooperation from the antique violin business , and that has to be overcome .
It may help us to produce violins and other instruments one day that are just as good as the million - dollar Stradivarius .
And this research could also tell us ways to better preserve instruments , too . ”

Most of the music on an iPod is not from iTunes , reveals report
The Jupiter Research report says that , on average , only 20 of the tracks on an iPod will be from the iTunes shop .
Far more important to iPod owners , said the study , was free music ripped from CDs someone already owned or acquired from file - sharing sites .
The report 's authors claimed their findings had profound implications for the future of the online music market .
Ripped disks
They estimate that during 2006 Europeans will spend more than 385 m euros ( £ 260 m ) on digital music - the majority of this spending will be on tracks from Apple 's iTunes store .
However , the report into the habits of iPod users reveals that 83 % of iPod owners do not buy digital music regularly .
The minority , 17 % , buy and download music , usually single tracks , at least once per month .
On average , the study reports , only 5 % of the music on an iPod will be bought from online music stores .
The rest will be from CDs the owner of an MP3 player already has or tracks they have downloaded from file - sharing sites .
The report warned against simple characterisations of the music - buying public that divide people into those that pay and those that pirate .
" It is not instructive to think of portable media player owners , nor iPod owners specifically , as homogenous groups , " warned the report .
It said : " Digital music buyers do not necessarily stop file - sharing upon buying legally . "
The importance of " free " to digital music fans should not be underestimated , warned the report , and should be a factor for newer digital music firms , such as Spiral Frog , which use an ad- supported model .
Perhaps the only salient characteristic shared by all owners of portable music players was that they were more likely to buy more music - especially CDs .
" Digital music purchasing has not yet fundamentally changed the way in which digital music customers buy music , " read the report .
Der enorme Vorteil des Internet , den wir heutzutage für selbstverständlich erachten , liegt in der Möglichkeit , direkte Verbindungen zwischen jedem einzelnen Rechner weltweit herzustellen .
Dies geht nur , weil jeder mit jedem kostenlos Daten austauscht .
Doch aktuelle Entwicklungen in den USA und anderswo bedrohen diese " Netzneutralität " .
Breitbandanbieter könnten sich künftig abschotten .
Es gibt Geschichten , für die muss man etwas weiter ausholen .
Dies hier ist eine , und diese beginnt in einem Zeitalter , das anders war , als das heutige .
Damals , in den frühen Neunzigerjahren , war es eigentlich kaum vorstellbar , dass man nur wenige Jahre später einmal mit jedem Menschen auf der Erde – beziehungsweise dessen Rechner – kommunizieren können würde , ohne einen dicken Batzen Geld dafür an die damals noch unter dem Bundespost - Logo firmierende Telekom zu überweisen .
Auslandstelefonate waren teuer , Mobiltelefonie Luxus , Filme kamen aus dem Fernsehen , dem Kino oder der Videothek , Bücher aus dem Buchladen / der Bibliothek und Musik musste man sich mühsam im Plattenladen besorgen ( okay , das war zumindest ein haptisches Erlebnis ) .
Dann kamen das Netz und die große Digitalisierungswelle , die alles zügig umkrempelten , rationalisierten und uns eine Kommunikations - und Medienvielfalt ermöglichten , von der wir Jahre zuvor nur träumen konnten .
Die heutigen Probleme bei der Auswahl interessanter Inhalte und die immer geringere Aufmerksamkeitsspanne stehen auf einem ganz anderen Blatt .
Doch was ist überhaupt die Hauptneuerung , die radikalste Idee , für die das Internet damals stand und heute noch steht ?
Ganz einfach : Jeder ist mit jedem verbunden - und das auch noch zu unglaublich preisgünstigen Konditionen , egal ob der Nutzer nun in München , Mexiko oder Marokko sitzt .
Das war und ist revolutionär , und liegt doch schon im Begriff " Internet " verborgen : Ein Netz , das alle Netze miteinander vereint .
Waren Computernetzwerke früher nur lose miteinander verwoben , ist die heutige Internet - Infrastruktur offen und allumfassend .
Jeder spricht mit jedem .
Man kommt meist problemlos von Punkt A nach B . Wer eine Adresse kennt , findet seinen Weg .
Provider tauschen Daten untereinander aus , über so genannte Peering - Abkommen sogar kostenlos , wenn ihr Internet - Verkehr in beide Richtungen ungefähr übereinstimmt .
Gezahlt werden muss nur für den Zugang auf die Datenautobahn , oder , als Betreiber eines Servers , für dessen Erreichbarkeit .
Diese " Alles in einem Netz " - Philosophie ist so sehr allgemeingültig , dass nicht einmal die meisten repressive Regierungen auf die Idee kommen würden , ihrem Land nur ausgewählte Inhalte zu präsentieren .
Nein , selbst in China hat man breiten Zugriff auf das komplette Internet , auch wenn Filter und Listen bestimmte Adressen blockieren .
Auf die Idee der Gestaltung eines eigenen Netzes sind die Machthaber aber zum Glück nicht gekommen .
Dabei war diese Idee bis Mitte der Neunzigerjahre auch in Wirtschaftskreisen noch weit verbreitet .
T - Online ( a.k.a. BTX ) wollte seinen eigenen Dienst , AOL eine eigene " User Experience " und Microsoft versuchte , sein eigenes " Microsoft Network " ( MSN ) durchzudrücken .
Aus Firmensicht eine prima Idee : Man herrschte über seine eigene Infrastruktur , konnte von Unternehmen für den Zugang zu den Eigennetz - Kunden Geld verlangen und unerwünschte Inhalte ( Preistabellen von Konkurrenten ! ) aus dem Firmendienst heraushalten .
Zum Glück hat sich diese Vision der Online - Dienste zugunsten des Internet nicht erfüllt , selbst wenn Deutschlands heute noch immer größter Provider T - Online in seinen Internet - Anfangstagen mit schlechter Web - Service - Qualität alles tat , die User im eigenen Dienst zu halten ...
Jedoch : Das alles weiß heute nur leider anscheinend niemand mehr zu schätzen .
Aktuelle Entwicklungen in den USA ( und schätzungsweise sehr bald auch in Deutschland ) weisen in Richtung der ersten Brüche der so genannten Netzneutralität ( " network neutrality " ) , die das großartige Fundament dieses noch großartigeren Internet darstellen .
Gleich bei mehreren großen Internet Providern in den USA stößt die Netzneutralität mehr und mehr auf Ablehnung .
Den ersten Vorstoß wagte Edward Whitacre , CEO des US - Telecom - Giganten AT&T , bereits im vergangenen Jahr .
Damals meinte er in Anwesenheit von Pressevertretern , dass " Inhalteanbieter " wie Google doch eigentlich ihn bezahlen müssten , weil er ihnen Zugang zu den Kunden verschaffe .
Das Statement " eigentlich müssten die für meine Leitungen bezahlen " rückte er zwischenzeitlich zwar wieder etwas zurecht , ist aber dennoch der Meinung , dass man künftig nicht nur von seinen Kunden ( die ja schließlich die Breitbandinfrastruktur bezahlen ) , sondern auch von Internet - Firmen Gelder verlangen könnte – auf diese Weise brächte man womöglich auch die lästige Voice - over - IP - Konkurrenz unter Kontrolle ...
Whitacre pfeift nur die schrillste Version eines Liedes , das auch von anderen großen US - Providern geträllert wird .
Egal ob sie Comcast , Bell South oder Verizon heißen , alle sind verdammt heiß auf das so genannte " Triple Play " .
Dabei sollen künftig Internet , TV und Telefon aus einer Breitbandleitung kommen .
Für fortgeschrittene Internet - Nutzer ist das längst gegeben , doch die Provider wollen Vermarktungspakete schnüren , die die Konkurrenz möglichst ausschließen .
Wann wird der erste Provider also beginnen , Websites der Konkurrenz zu blockieren ?
Bislang sehen die Betreiber großer Websites solche Muskelspiele noch gelassen .
Niemand würde wohl Mitglied bei einem Breitbandprovider werden , der den Zugang zu Google sperrt .
Allerdings versuchen die Telekomgiganten derzeit , eine Revision des US - Telekommunikationsgesetzes zu beeinflussen .
Sollte die Netzneutralität darin eine geringere Rolle spielen , wäre die Gefahr einer Zersplitterung des Netzes womöglich recht groß .
Die Argumentation , man habe doch groß in eigene Glasfasernetze investiert / wolle investieren , scheint als Argument genug .
Derweil geistern in den USA noch andere Anti-Netzneutralitäts - Ideen durch die Landschaft – aktuell überlegen die Portale MSN und Yahoo beispielsweise , nur noch dann E - Mails an ihre Kunden ohne Versandung im Spam - Filter weiterzuleiten , wenn die Versender eine Art Porto bezahlen .
Vor wenigen Jahren hätte man solche Ideen , die vorgeblich der Müllmail - Bekämpfung dienen , noch den Vogel gezeigt , inzwischen sind sie sehr real .
Und was ist in Deutschland ?
Auch hier gieren die großen Telkos , vorneweg die Telekom , nach dem Triple Play und der Möglichkeit , wieder zu alten Monopolen zurückzukehren .
Der aktuelle Streit um den Zugang zum neuen Telekom - Glasfasernetz ist , wenn man einmal ein bisschen darüber nachdenkt , nichts anderes als der Versuch der Telekom , die Netzneutralität zu brechen .
Sollten andere das Supernetz nicht nutzen können , könnte sich die Telekom schnell dazu entscheiden , einfach Konkurrenten " auch so " auszublenden .
Noch sind all diese Spekulationen albtraumhafte Bilder .
Sie könnten jedoch schneller Realität werden , als es der freiheitsliebenden Internet - Community lieb ist .

As many gay men have before him , Mr. Clark chose to live in a city rather than the sort of small town where he was raised in the hope that Kansas City would provide a greater margin of tolerance and also of safety .
Even in nearby Independence , Mo. , he said , “ if you kiss your partner in a restaurant , you could find somebody waiting for you outside when you went to the car . ”
But have n’t things changed radically from the days when lesbians and gay men were considered pariahs , before gay marriage initiatives became ballot issues , before Ellen DeGeneres was picked to host the Oscars , and cable TV staples like “ Queer Eye for the Straight Guy ” made a competitive sport of group hugs ?
In some senses and in certain places , apparently , they have .
The landscape of acceptance , as the Snickers commercial inadvertently illustrated , is constantly shifting — broadening in one place and contracting somewhere else .
The country in which anti-gay advocates like the Rev. Fred Phelps once drew headlines for picketing Matthew Shepard ’s funeral and preaching what was called “ a Day - Glo vision of hatred ” can seem very far away at times from the laissez - faire place in which an estimated 70 percent of Americans say they know someone who is gay .
“ We do n’t administrate public displays of affection , ” said Andrew Shields , World Church Secretary of the Community of Christ , a Christian evangelical church with headquarters in Independence .
“ Homosexuality is still in discussion in our church .
But our denominational point of view is that we uphold the worth of all persons , and there is no controversy on whether people have a right to express themselves . ”
The tectonics of attitude are shifting in subtle ways that are geographic , psychic and also generational , suggested Katherine M. Franke , a lesbian who teaches law and is a director of the Center for the Study of Law and Culture at Columbia University .
“ I ’ve been attacked on the street and called all sorts of names ” for kissing a female partner in public , Professor Franke said .
“ The reception our affection used to generate was violence and hatred , ” she added .
“ What I ’ve found in the last five years is that my girlfriend and I get smiles from straight couples , especially younger people .
Now there ’s almost this aggressive sense of ‘ Let me tell you how terrific we think that is . ’ ”

Yet gay - bashing still occurs routinely , Mr. Patton of the Anti-Violence Project said , even in neighborhoods like Chelsea in Manhattan , where the sight of two men kissing on the street can hardly be considered a frighten - the - horses proposition .
“ In January some men were leaving a bar in Chelsea , ” saying goodbye with a kiss , Mr. Patton said .
“ One friend got into a taxi and then a car behind the taxi stopped and some guys jumped out and beat up the other two . ”
One victim of the attack , which is under investigation by the police department ’s Hate Crimes Task Force , was bruised and shaken .
The second had a broken jaw .
When Liberals Rule The World / Stats say the GOP is dying .
But red-staters are breeding like drunken ferrets .
Who wins ?
Here 's the good news :
The Republican party is dying .
Slow , painful , twitching , secreting war and intolerance and desperation like a fetid gas , snarling and gagging like Jabba the Hutt being choked by the hard chain of progress and hope and relaxed social mores and an upcoming Generation Next that seems to sense that screaming about gays and women 's rights and Muslims and drugs actually does n't do much to move the human experiment forward in the slightest .
Is this not delicious ?
Is this not cause for rejoicing ?
According to Pew Research , the percentage of young 'uns age 18 to 25 ( a.k.a. Generation Next ) who identify with Republicans has been in steady decline since the early ' 90s , and now hovers around a meager 35 percent , down from a high of 55 percent in the Reagan - toxic early - 90s , and is still dropping , whereas fully 48 percent of 18 - to - 25 - year - olds now lean Democratic ... and rising .
Seems Generation
Next tend to be more socially liberal and much less worried about the trembling " sanctity " of the failed nuclear family , and are overall less inclined to align with a particular religion .
Indeed , it almost makes you want to weep and sigh and go buy a large grass - fed free - range organic hybrid vibrator .
Ah , but there is a flip side .
A counterargument .
A dark cloud of righteous bleakness and it looms like a giant synthetic cheesecake - scented Glade PlugIn of potential misery .
It is this : According to another set of data , for the past 30 years or so , conservatives -- particularly those of the right - wing red-state Christian strain -- have been out - breeding liberals by a margin of at least 20 percent , if not far more .
It 's true .
The reason ?
Why , God loves babies , of course .
White American babies , most especially .
Also : issues of space , religion , sexual orientation and , of course , conscience .
Or , you know , lack thereof .
One theory goes like this :
Libs are generally more socially conscious and hence tend to actually give a modicum of thought to what it means to pop out a brood of children in this modern overstuffed age .
Also , many other liberal bohos are ( admittedly ) happy selfish suckwads who want all the modern booty for themselves and wo n't want to give up the Ducati and the plasma and the biannual trip to Cinque Terre for the sake of a pod of rug rats and 15 grand a year ( each ) for private kindergarten .
Translation : Libs just are n't procreating like they could / should be .
Conservative Christians , of course , have no such conscience .
Among the right - wing God-lovin ' set , there is often little real awareness of planetary health or resource abuse or the notion that birth control is actually a very , very good idea indeed , and therefore it 's completely natural to worship at the altar of minivans and SUVs and megachurches and massive all - American entitlement and have little qualm about popping out six , seven , 19 gloopy tots to populate the world with frat boys and Ford F - 150 buyers and food court managers .
I always assumed it might actually be a good thing that conservatives breed so mindlessly , because all those unhappy neocon kids , all those repressed misled tots grow up and eventually begin to ( well , sometimes ) think for themselves and ultimately do what any good kid does : rebel against their parents ' silly dogma and become a bit more open - minded and hopeful , right ?
Not exactly .
Apparently , according to the research , four out of five kids actually stick with the political affiliation of their parents , generation after generation , with religious conservatives far more unlikely than their liberal brethren to allow their kids to develop the capacity for independent thought ( given how it 's so , you know , dangerous to America ) .
Also , one word : homeschooling .
I 'm just sayin ' .
So then , the big question :
How can these two major demographics exist at the same time ?
How can we be enjoying the slow death of the GOP along with an impressive surge in young Democrats , and yet simultaneously be undergoing this quiet toxic swelling in ranks of the army of conservative autobots ?
The logic breaks down all over .
It seems impossible .
Either we are we headed toward a new dawn full of smart social liberalism , perhaps leading to concomitant ideas of peace and tolerance and a newly evolved American identity , or there is another massive group lurking in the shadows , entirely overlooked by Pew Research , a seething army of religious conservatives who are working like a spiritual STD to force us backward once again , much the way the Bush regime brutally reversed decades of social , environmental , fiscal and international progress and made war and isolationism and megachurch evangelicals the lords of the playground for a shocklingly painful blip of time .
Hell , maybe it 's both .
Maybe what we 're getting with these two sets of data is simply a glimpse of the next two major phases of the culture , the next two major swings of the sociopolitical pendulum , in sequence .
In other words , maybe we are indeed headed into a delightful progressive liberal phase , one with the potential to radically , even permanently change the way we view gender and identity and family and even America 's role in the world .
But then the sad recoil .
The clench , the terror , the loud screeching from all those red-state kids who are being taught right now to despise change and fear alternative views and see anything that 's not wrapped in the flag or the Bible or a McDonald 's wrapper as evil and dangerous and worthy of derision / elimination .
Or maybe there 's another possibility .
Perhaps it 's something even more wild and delicious and improbable , and we are all , liberal and conservative alike , evolving more toward social progressiveness merely by default , not through social engineering or political maneuvering or reactionary Christian dread but merely as a nearly unconscious by - product of the times .
In other words , maybe everyone is trending more progressive and open merely by existing on this planet today , almost despite ourselves .
I know .
Completely idiotic .
I must be totally drunk .
Option 3 is , of course , the most likely : Both sets of data are full of flaw and misinterpretation and wishful thinking .
Neither is completely correct and by the way statistics are for dreamers and acidheads and pollsters and should be thrown over the shoulder , like salt , right before you go back for another Xanax and a beer .
And hence we are , as ever , simply a mad intoxicated mishmash of reactions and beliefs and ideologies , a God - obsessed sex- crazed drug - lovin ' sociopolitical train wreck of a country that does n't really know its ass from a hole in the ground or its
God from a burp in the sky .
Personally , I 'm going with the new liberal dawn thing .
Hell , it does n't hurt to dream , right ?

Perl is a favorite flogging target , both of me and others , both of detractors and fans .
So is Java .
Both tend to become favorite flogging targets due primarily to two factors , I believe :
each has a strong , widespread , zealous body of detractors who find it unutterably bad each has a strong , tightly - knit , zealous body of fans who find it unutterably divine
As such , both end up being example languages for all sorts of points ( half - baked or otherwise ) .
Favorite characteristics for maligning them are , in Java ’s case , the immense scaffolding requirements of the language and , in Perl ’s case , a harsh - looking syntax .
Java ’s noun- oriented philosophy is its excuse for the scaffolding .
The design of Perl is often justified by explanations such as Paul Graham ’s comment that “ Real ugliness is not harsh - looking syntax , but having to build programs out of the wrong concepts . ”
One of Java ’s design philosophy principles is protection for the programmer from himself .
It is considered a Good Thing that Java incorporates features intended to make it difficult to shoot yourself in the foot .
One of Perl ’s design philosophy principles , meanwhile , is that of enabling the programmer ( TIMTOWTDI and “ makes easy things easy , and difficult things possible ” ) .
In the process of trying to make dangerous things difficult , Java also makes things that should be easy rather more difficult .
In the process of trying to make difficult things possible , Perl ( the “ Swiss Army Chainsaw ” ) also makes it easy to saw your own leg off .
There ’s a distinct trade - off going on , here .
On the same subject , C and C++ are compared thusly , by Bjarne Stroustrup :
C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot ; C++ makes it harder , but when you do , it blows your whole leg off .
For a better idea of how that ’s relevant , feel free to substitute “ Perl ” for “ C ” and “ Java ” for “ C++ ” .
Flon ’s
Law provides an interesting thought on this subject , as well — one quite worthy of consideration :
There is not now , nor has there ever been , nor will there ever be , any programming language in which it is the least bit difficult to write bad code .
So , we must ask :
What is the important guiding factor toward which we should aim our efforts when designing , or simply choosing for a given project , a programming language ?
The answer , I believe , is enabling the programmer to write good code .
We cannot prevent him writing bad code .
We can not force him to write good code .
We can not get good code by simply making programming easy .
What we must do is make writing good code * as rewarding as possible , and to hell with all other concerns .
The definition of “ good code ” will change from project to project , to be sure , but within general problem domains there will be definite common characteristics that will arise again and again in the language that best rewards writing good code .
The definition of “ writing ” never changes , however , for this metric .
a note about frameworks and other peripheral tools :
If you want to get something done Today , the frameworks and other peripheral tools associated with a language are likewise valuable in direct proportion to their facility for enabling your programmers to write good code , but such value cannot be usefully measured in a vacuum .
It must be measured as part of the overall results of evaluating the language .
In the here - and - now , your familiarity with a langage , enjoyment of working with it , and ability to expand your knowledge of it quickly are additional factors to keep in mind .
If , on the other hand , you instead wish to invest in your future , you must consider not what frameworks , IDEs , libraries , and so on exist for a given language , but what among such things will likely exist when you need them at crunch - time , at some point in the future for which you are planning .
This includes measuring your ability to generate tools for that language yourself .
She had seen a TV news report on Lyme disease , and then she had checked the Internet .
All her symptoms were right there .
" But you have AIDS , " I said .
" And you do n't want to take meds .
That 's why you 're feeling so bad . "
" I 'm really scared about Lyme disease , " she said .
" I really need to get treated . "
" If you want to be scared , how about that untreated AIDS of yours ? "
We looked at each other .
It was an impasse .
The fact that logic was on my side mattered not at all : evidently the real was just a little too real for her .
How much better to find another illness to be scared of , obsess over , get treated for , get rid of .
Eventually she coerced my colleague into testing her for Lyme disease and treating her despite negative tests .
Then she decided her symptoms might actually be due to a brain tumor , instead .
And so it went , until she died of AIDS .
Of four patients I saw in a single hour last week , three announced how scared they were of the avian flu .
I reassured them , but there was quite a bit I did not say , and here it is .
I did not say :
If you want to be scared , then how about that drug habit of yours you think I do n't know about ?
How about the fact that you are 100 pounds overweight and eat nothing but junk ?
How about the fact that in a few short months Medicaid is going to stop paying for your very expensive medications and no one knows how just high that Medicare Part D deductible and co-payment are going to be ?
I did not say :
If you want something to be scared of , how about the drug - resistant Klebsiella that is all over this very hospital , an ordinary run -of - the - mill bacterial strain that has become so resistant to so many antibiotics that we 've had to resurrect a few we stopped using 30 years ago because they were so toxic .
That Klebsiella is one scary germ .
It 's in hospitals all over the country , and by now it 's probably killed a thousandfold more people than the avian flu .
And now , a hysterical followup to my recent columns on Dell tech support , submitted by a reader .
The setup :
He 'd bought a new 19 - inch flat - panel screen that he loved so much , he sent Dell a quick note of commendation .
" I try to send positive notes to businesses once in a while , " he writes , " to balance the negative karma from the assertive complaining I do . "
Here 's the compliment he posted through Dell 's Web site : " No problem !
I just wanted to tell you that I just received the 1905 FP monitor that I ordered last week , and it 's awesome .
Not only that , but it arrived just 5 days after I ordered it , and it was a breeze to set up .
I can already tell that it 's the best $ 500 I 've spent in a long time .
Thanks ! "
And here 's the response Dell sent him .
( As he so aptly puts it : " Makes you wonder how they would handle a more complex issue ... " )
==========
From : US -- CTS -- Desktop-- Support
Dear Mr. Burger ,
Thank you for contacting Dell about your issue .
I 'm glad to be of assistance .
I sense you are not getting optimal performance from your system .
I want to help you get it working quickly so you can enjoy your computer .
Sometimes it ’s really amazing how a bad picture can turn into an “ ok picture ”  by following the steps bellow .
But do n’t really expect miracles , because what really makes a picture outstanding is the subject and the creative idea it transmits .
First lets look at some examples and after that I will show you the steps .
For the first one I used all steps except 2 , 7 and 10 .
The second one uses all steps except 2 and 3 .
The last one uses all of them except 3 and 10 .
Step 1 : Cropping and Rotating
This corrects the composition .
Concentrate on the subject by “ getting ”  it closer and take some rules under consideration .
In my opinion rotating is rarely used if you keep the camera in the right position .
However , sometimes my camera fails to rotate the vertical images after shooting so I have to do it manually .
Step 2 : Eliminating Objects
Some undesired little objects that could not be avoided during shooting can be erased by using clone and healing tools in Photoshop .
The classic situation is represented by electricity and phone wires .
Step 3 : Lighten the shadows
This will reveal details .
To do so , in Photoshop you will need a different layer , or , in newer Lightroom version , there is a function that will do so for you .
Picasa comes with “ Fill Light ”  feature .
If you got a Nikon camera , then you probably also have the Capture NX software which also helps improve the already in - camera D - Lighting .
Step 4 : Curves
This will mainly adjust the contrast and brightness .
The “ S ”  shape is good for improvements ; details with example here .
Step 5 : Levels
Levels and Curves most likely go hand - in - hand , sometimes just one of them is enough .
However , levels also affect color tones and therefore very useful in many situations .
Step 6 : Hue / Saturation
Most pictures wont need this .
Note that aesthetic pictures are those with natural colors , so do n’t just pull the saturation over the limits .
I rather recommend color control via Selective Color .
Step 7 : Black and White Conversion
This is definitely optionally ; some details here .
Usually , the pictures that look good in BW are classic portraits , pictures of old stuff , pictures that concentrate more on a powerful concept and shapes rather than colorful nature , but I really think there are no rules for this .
Step 8 : Sharpness
Sharper pictures usually look better than very smooth ones , revealing more details of the shapes forms .
For this I usually use “ unsharp mask ”  in Photoshop , and , if the picture is way too soft , overall sharpness .
Step 9 : Noise Reduction
Not just after shooting at high ISO , but also after the sharpness adjustment , the picture will likely become noisy .
NeatImage is the freeware software I recommend for this job .
Some people just simply like grainy pictures , but then I recommend adding some uniform grain not the sharpness noise which is not uniform .
Step 10 : Blurring the Background
Compact digital cameras , even if they do have manual settings or shutter priority , still do n’t handle DOF very good .
In this case you can pop up the main subject by blurring the background .
You can just blur just a few areas with the brush , or , create a different layer to handle things more accurate around the subject .
However , its not ( and never will be ) the same thing as real DOF from dSLRs .
Step 11 : Adding a Border
Usually a simple one ( white or black ) is the best choice , but for details about this check part1 and part2 of the borders tutorial .
Step 12 : Adding a Signature
Its not a must , but picture fraud over the internet is very high our days , so why not having your name on your work ?
Step 13 : Resizing
Unless you were preparing a picture for printing , smaller images are better for the web because they load faster .
I recommend doing this as a last step , otherwise too many details ( pixels ) will be lost .
More than that , try these settings at the resizing in Photoshop : to maintain original sharpness when scaling down , click on Resample Image and choose Bicubic and 70 % JPEG quality .

It is the dream of many to get on an airplane and cross the ocean to know distant and unknown lands .
In fact , it is one of the objectives that most commonly appear in the lists of New Year ’s resolutions for Mexicans , but which most of them fail to comply with because they think that in order to travel , much is needed for one thing : money .
And as we already have too many personal expenses , we relegate that dream until it seems an impossible thing .
But the reason for this article is to tell you that you can travel , that never like today has been so easy and that , in addition , can be very cheap , if you plan your trip with time and intelligence .
I say intelligence because if your plan is to travel without finishing all your savings , you should not decide to take that trip to , for example , Venice or the city of New York , places that are known to be extremely expensive .
Instead of traveling there , why do not you go to places that are more extraordinary , unique and exotic , and much cheaper ?
Maybe your answer is that you do not know which sites are like that .
Well , do not hesitate anymore , because here we present a list of five countries where you can travel with very little money .
1. Thailand
This beautiful country in Southeast Asia is known among backpackers for being one of the most paradisiacal places that can be visited with little money .
Thailand is a tropical country with a very rich culture and food worthy of the most demanding palates .
Some of the reasons why this beautiful place known as the Land of Smiles is so cheap is because you can visit several of its main attractions without paying a penny : the amazing beaches and the delicate Buddhist temples .
2. Vietnam
Although the name of this country can cause your first thought to be war , because of the famous war that took place along with the United States more than forty years ago , Vietnam is a place like no other that charms its visitors .
Perhaps it is their beautiful rural landscapes with rice fields and mountains , or perhaps the fact that you can enjoy the best dishes of their cuisine in small plastic stools on the edge of the street .
The delicious coffee , the beautiful coastline with tropical beaches and the mountains with indigenous groups that boast of their colorful culture are other reasons why you can not miss this country .
3. India
India is a country that will overwhelm all your senses .
From the multicolored fabrics worn by women in their typical clothes , to the smells and flavors of one of the most delicious cuisines in the world , India is a transformative experience and , believe me , you will never be the same again .
This country is one of the largest in the world and offers so many attractions that although you will visit a couple a day , there would be no way to end it in a year .
Among its most popular sites are the Taj Mahal , one of the wonders of the world , the sacred river Ganges , the desert landscapes of Rajasthan and the beautiful beaches of the south .
4. Poland
If a trip to Asia is not your thing , because of the distance or because you die to get to know Europe , then I recommend a holiday in Poland , one of the most economical and at the same time beautiful countries in the Old World .
This place drains interesting history and has nothing more and nothing less than fourteen sites named Patrimonies of Humanity by Unesco .
You can spend your days here getting to know cities with beautiful architecture , such as Krakow and Warsaw , walking in the woods , tasting their famous vodka or touring all the country ’s castles .
5. Turkey
Our last recommendation is about a place between Europe and the Middle East : Turkey , a huge country that you should visit even once in your life .
This nation has it all , from small villages full of magic and towering mountains , to Mediterranean beaches and ruins of ancient empires .
Because it is located in one of the most privileged locations , both geographically and culturally , Turkey is a place like no other .
Visit the spectacular mosques of Istanbul , get on a hot air balloon in Cappadocia and swim in the hot springs of Hierapolis .
There you have five very economical countries for your next trip .
Which of them attracted you the most ?
Remember that traveling with little money is possible , you just have to plan it well .
Poznamo dve vrsti naključij : vzorčno naključje in nepričakovan splet okoliščin .
V principu sta si enaka , samo da prvi deluje na manjšem obsegu , gre za nekakšen nepričakovan mikro - splet mikro- okoliščin .
Naj razložim .
Recimo , da obstaja idealna številčna ključavnica za kolo , ki je taka , da nima trenja pri obračanju cifer ( števk , hihi ) .
Recimo , da imam to ključavnico v rokah in cifre zarolam in se ustavi pri 0000 .
To je naključje !
Da od vseh možnih 10.000 kombinacij pade taka , da ima cifre enake in da so to ravno ničle .
Rezultat je vendar najnižje možno število !
( ” Iz dane množice , ” se obregnejo matematiki . )
Je to res naključje ?
Znanost odkima .
Verjetnost , da pade katerokoli število , je enaka , če predpostavimo da je ključavnica idealna .
Naleteli smo na “ vzorčno naključje ” , kar pomeni , da rezultat sistema subjektu predstavlja prepoznaven vzorec .
Bolj mi je prepoznaven , bolj ga racionaliziram in jemljem za “ več vrednega ” .
V ta razred spadajo vsi tisti primeri , ko subjekt , močno pod božjim vplivom , vidi obraz kakšnega svojega pop idola ( marija , ježušček ) v pravkar - razsutem kupu kamenja , mikada , svojih zob ali česa podobnega .
Zvezde na nebu .
Oblak v obliki ovce .
Drugi primer .
Po dooolgem času pomislim na nekoga , ta pa pride izza vogala .
Kakšno naključje !
Znanost zdolgočaseno zmajuje z glavo .
Ti imaš razlog , da si tam .
On ima razlog , da je tam .
Vajini prisotnosti sta rezultata vajinih preteklosti , prete žno malo - pred - tem - dogodkov , ki so spet posledice vajinih odločitev , seštetih z odločitvami in preteklimi dogodki ostalih vpletenih ljudi , ki … No , saj razumete .
Edino pribežališče pravih naključij , tako trdijo nekateri , bi lahko bili samostojni razpadi atomskih jeder ( think razpolovna doba , Schrödingerjeva mačka ) in te zadeve .
Ampak razpadi atomskih jeder se zagotovo ravnajo po nekih zakonih in so posledica nekih drugih dogodkov .
Samo ne vemo še , kaj na razpade vpliva in česar ne poznamo , temu pripisujemo nek večji pomen .
Vedno bolj pa kaže , da tud ti dogodki niso naključni v matematičnem smislu popolnega naključja .
Torej smo verjetno brez “ pravih ” naključij .
Vsako naključno srečanje je samo bolj ali manj nepričakovan splet okoliščin .
Kje potem postavimo mejo ?
Kdaj nek nenaključen dogodek v naših glavah postane “ naključje ” ?
Kakšen mora biti nivo nepričakovanosti , da dogodek zaznamujemo , si ga posledično bolj zapomnimo in govorimo o njem drugim ljudem ?
Zakaj imajo taki dogodki večjo virtualno vrednost od ostalih ?
Zanimiva posledica pomanjkanja pravih naključij je verjetno ta , da je svet determinističen .
Da je že v trenutku velikega poka naš svet imel eno samo možno prihodnost in da vsak naslednji trenutek samo še čaka , da se bo zgodil .
( Če ste slučajno pomislili , da to kaj zveča možnosti za obstoj boga , ste se gladko zmotili . )
Ampak ta debata že zahaja v globoko vodo , jaz pa ne znam plavat brez rokavčkov .
Drugič .
Columbia University Computing History
A Chronology of Computing at Columbia University
Books , manuals , journals , magazines , notes , and artifacts ... 65 years of computing at Columbia University .
Last update : Mon Feb 17 14:15:34 2020 Adapted for mobile devices 4 April 2015 .
Converted to HTML5 7 February 2019 .
[ Credits ] [ Introduction ] [ Timeline ] [ Epilog ] [ Tables ] [ Acronyms ] [ Glossary ] [ Sources ] [ Links ] [ FAQ ]
This document gives a chronology of computing at Columbia University , as best I can piece it together , written mainly in Jan -Feb 2001 , updated periodically since then ( time of last update listed above ) .
It does not aspire to be a general history or museum of computing , but in some ways it 's not far from one either .
Corrections , additional information , and more photos are always welcome .
In most cases where the text says " today " , that means 2001 ; obviously much has changed since then .
If you came here looking for the history of the Kermit protocol , Kermit software , or the Kermit Project , you can find some of it below in the 1980 - 82 timeframe , and a bit more HERE .
Plus some 2012 oral history transcripts at the Computer History Museum HERE and HERE
Who am I and why did I write this ?
Starting around 2000 , people popped into my office all the time to ask " when did such - and - such happen ? " — the first e-mail , the first typesetting , the first networking , the first PC lab , the first hacker breakins , etc -- since I was there for most of it .
So I took some time and wrote it down , and in so doing became fascinated with the earlier history .
I was a user of the Columbia Computer Center from 1967 until 1977 in my various jobs and as a Columbia student , and I was on staff from 1974 until 2011 .
Brief bio :
After some early programming experience in the Army ( mid-1960s ) , the Engineering School and Physics Dept ( late 1960s , early 70s ) , and Mount Sinai Hospital ( early 70s ) , I came to work at the Computer Center Systems Group in 1974 , hired by its manager Howard Eskin out of his graduate Computer Science classes .
After a year of OS / 360 programming , I was manager of the PDP - 11/50 and the DEC - 20s ( first e-mail , early networking , the first campuswide academic timesharing ) , then manager of " Systems Integration " ( first microcomputers , PCs , Kermit ) , principal investigator of the " Hermit " distributed computing research project , then manager of Network Planning for the University and chair of the University - wide Network Planning Group , before " retiring " to the Kermit Project , which had less ( well , zero ) meetings and way more fun .
I was laid off from Columbia in 2011 but still have access to this website .
( Note : the Columbia Kermit Project website was cancelled and its website frozen July 1 , 2011 ; the new Open Source Kermit Project website is HERE . )
Capsule Summary
Disclaimers
Obviously this is written from my perspective ; others might have different recollections or views .
In particular , at least after 1963 , this turns out to be more a history of centralized academic computing , rather than all computing , at Columbia , giving short shrift to the departments , administrative computing , the libraries , and the outlying campuses ; a more complete history needs these perspectives too .
I 've made every attempt to check the facts ; any remaining errors are mine -- please feel free to point them out .
Computers are value - neutral tools that can be used for good or evil , and it is clear that from the very beginning they have been used for both .
This document does not aim to extol the virtues of computers in general , nor of any particular company that makes them , but only to chronicle their use at Columbia University .
Acknowledgements
Automatic computing at Columbia University got off to a serious start in the 1920s in the with the installation of large IBM accounting and calculating machines in the Statistics and Astronomy departments and a close relationship that developed with IBM that would last 50 years .
Columbia soon developed a world - class reputation for innovation in scientific computing .
As World War II approached , Columbia astronomy professor Wallace Eckert was recruited by the US Naval Observatory to apply the techniques he had developed at Columbia to the production of the almanacs that guided air and sea navigation throughout the war .
At the end of the war Eckert rejoined Columbia as the founder and director of IBM Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory on 116th Street , IBM 's first pure research facility , which also served as Columbia 's " computer center , " and created the world 's first Computer Science curriculum .
Several groundbreaking early computers were designed and / or built at Watson Lab .
In 1963 Columbia opened its own Computer Center on campus underneath the Business School .
From 1963 to 1975 all computing at Columbia was done on large central IBM mainframes , with a handful of smaller computers in the departments .
Jobs were coded on punched cards and run by operators in the Computer Center machine room .
In 1973 a public Self - Service Input / Output area ( SSIO ) was opened with key punches , card readers , and printers where users could submit jobs and retrieve the results themselves .
Beginning in 1975 interactive timesharing was introduced based on central Digital Equipment Corporation computers with public hardcopy and video terminals installed in the SSIO area and in the Engineering building .
Other terminal rooms were added over time , mainly in the dormitories .
During 1977 - 80 a lively online community developed , with email , bulletin boards , and file sharing , while courses increasingly required the use of the central computers , or took advantage of them in other ways .
In the 1980s public terminals were gradually replaced by microcomputers , PCs , and workstations connected to the central computers through their serial ports , like terminals .
Columbia joined the ARPANET ( later to become the Internet ) in 1984 .
The terminal network was replaced in stages by Ethernet , which was also extended to dormitory rooms , offices , and even apartments .
About 1995 the combination of Windows 95 and the World Wide Web led to widespread migration from centralized timesharing to distributed desktop computing , wired and then increasingly wireless .
Students began to arrive with their own computers , laptops , tablets , and mobile devices ; the need for public PC labs dwindled .
By 2005 or so , the Computer Center merely provided the infrastructure , mainly the network , e-classrooms , and email .

I was inspired by Bruce Gilchrist 's Forty Years of Computing article from 1981 [ 3 ] ( so that makes it sixty seventy 79 years ! )
Special thanks to Bruce Gilchrist and Nuala Hallinan , each of whom contributed valuable archive material and considerable time , effort , and miles to this project ; to Herb Grosch for his awesome book as well as tons of new information , corrections , insights , anecdotes , and artifacts ; to Eric Hankam for the loan of his personal archive of photos and materials , his autobiography , and a wealth of Watson Lab recollections ; to Charlotte Moseley for preserving and contributing a large number of old IBM manuals ; and to Bob Resnikoff who unearthed his long - lost cache of 1980 machine - room and MSS photos .
Herb , in particular , was involved in this project on a daily basis since he first happened upon it in May 2003 until shortly before his death at 91 in January 2010 .
Herb remembered everything .
And thanks to the editors of IEEE Annals of the History of Computing for an announcement and abstract of this site in their April - June 2002 issue , and for announcing the online version of Herb Grosch 's book in the July - September 2003 issue .

Introduction
At the dawn of the new Millenium , computers and the network are ubiquitous ; we can't live without them .
It was n't always so .
How did we get here ?
A series of technological innovations including Pascal 's adder ( the Pascaline , 1600s ) , Leibnitz 's multiplier ( the Stepped Reckoner , about 1700 ) , the Jacquard loom ( 1804 ) , the Babbage Analytical and Difference Engines ( 1820s - 30s ) , electricity and electromagnetism , the telegraph , the Hollerith tabulating machine ( 1890 ) , the relay , the vacuum tube , core memory , the transistor , the laser , the integrated circuit , and on and on , each resulted in products that stimulated applications , which in turn stimulated the demand for more and better products , and before long computers entered the economy and the popular culture .
A case can be made that the computer industry got its start at Columbia University in the late 1920s and early 1930s when Professors Wood and Eckert , to advance their respective sciences , began to send designs and specifications for computing machines to IBM Corporation , which until then had been a maker of punched - card tabulating machines for the business market .
From those days through the 1980s , the relationship of Columbia with companies like IBM was symbiotic and fruitful ( and continues on a smaller scale to this day , mainly in the Physics department with the construction of massively parallel supercomputers -- who else would know how to connect 512 processors in a 6 - dimension mesh with the topology of a torus ? )
IBM Corporation itself was the child of Columbian Herman Hollerith .
The early days of invention and innovation are past .
Computers and networks are now well established in the daily lives of vast numbers of people in many nations , and certainly at Columbia University .
Today 's computers are off - the - shelf mass - market consumer appliances , which was perhaps inevitable and is no doubt a good thing in some ways .
How this came about is a story told elsewhere but as you 'll see below , some important parts of it happened right here .

Timeline
The story of computing at Columbia is presented chronologically .
Most links are to local documents , and therefore will work as long as all the files accompanying this document are kept together .
There are also a few relatively unimportant external links , which are bound to go bad sooner or later -- such is the Web .
1924 - 26 : The Columbia University Statistical Laboratory ( location unknown ) includes Hollerith tabulating , punching , and sorting machines , Burroughs adding machines , Brunsviga and Millionaire calculators ( the latter was the first device to perform direct multiplication ) , plus reference works such as math and statistical tables .
Prof. Robert E. Chaddock ( Statistics Dept ) was in charge .
The Astronomy department ( Prof. H. Jacoby ) still has the " five computing machines " [ 5 ] .

1926 : Wallace Eckert ( 1902 - 1971 ) joins Columbia 's Astronomy faculty , specializing in celestial mechanics and most especially the moon .
In pursuit of these interests , Eckert is to become a true computer pioneer .
1928 : Benjamin Wood ( 1894 -1986 ) , head of the University Bureau of Collegiate Educational Research [ 5 ] , proposes to Thomas J. Watson Sr. , president of IBM , a method for automated scoring of examination papers in large - scale testing programs ( which previously involved " acres of girls trying to tabulate ... test results " [ 45 ] ) .
After some discussion , Watson sent three truckloads of tabulating , card - punching , sorting , and accessory equipment to the basement of Hamilton Hall [ 9,40 ] .
1928 : Meanwhile in England , L.J. Comrie ( 1893 -1950 ) , Superintendant of H.M. Nautical Almanac
Office , begins a project to calculate future positions of the moon using punched cards , a sorter , a tabulator , and a duplicating punch , in what is probably the first use of these machines for scientific calculation [ 72 ] .
This work would shortly inspire Columbia 's Wallace Eckert to take the next historic step : automating these calculations .
As we will see , much of the impetus towards automated scientific computation ( and therefore modern computers ) came from astronomers , and its primary application was in navigation .
The same impetus brought us accurate , portable timepieces in the previous century .
1928 : Columbia 's medical school , the College of Physicians and Surgeons , moves from 10th Avenue and 55th - 60th Streets to Washington Heights between Broadway and Fort Washington Avenue , 165 th - 168th Streets , the former site of Hilltop Park ( 1903 - 1912 ) , the baseball stadium of the New York Yankees ( known as the New York Highlanders until 1912 ) .
Jun 1929 : Prof. Wood 's operation became the Columbia University Statistical Bureau ( PHOTOS ) .
In addition to tabulating test results , it served as a " computer center " for other academic departments , particularly the Dept of Astronomy , which used the equipment for " interpolating astronomical tables " [ 9,40 ] .

( The story of administrative computing prior to 1965 is still largely a mystery .
Dorothy Marshall , VP for ADP , upon her retirement in 1988 , wrote a reminiscence in the ADP Newsletter [ 11 ] , where she recalls that " ADP actually originated in the Controller 's Office , the first [ administrative ] department to use a punch - card system .
The first large system ADP acquired is still with us -- the Alumni Records and Gift Information System ( ARGIS ) -- and I recall very clearly the accusations that we were using all the tape drives and all the system resources at the expense of the University researchers . "
( This was to be a recurring theme . )
Unfortunately Dorothy did not mention dates or places . )
( Coincidentally , some clue was provided on the front page of the Columbia University website , 18 Jan 2001 , and subsequent University Record article [ 18 ] announcing the retirement of Joe Sulsona , shift supervisor of the Computer Center machine room , after 42 years : " Sulsona , a New York City native , went from high school directly to the military .
When he returned from Korea in 1957 at the age of 23 , he studied the latest in computing , gaining experience as a board programmer , which involved the manipulation of wires and plugs on a computer board , much like the original telephone operating systems .
He was hired at Columbia 's alumni faculty records office as a machine operator and spent his time punching out data cards using a small keypunch machine . " )

( Newsletters of the early 70s were devoted mainly to JCL hints and tips , announcements of meetings and conferences , announcements of OS / 360 upgrades , explanations of cost accounting , and lists of unclaimed tapes in the tape library -- up to 6 pages of numeric tape IDs on one occasion ( in the Earth Week issue no less : V6 # 5 , 15 Apr 1971 ) -- plus the annual April Fools Issue , usually featuring parodies of cost accounting .
Prior to 1971 , they also contained abstracts or reports of research projects , e.g. " Motivating Learning in Interracial Situations " ( V5 # 2 ) ; " French Business Elite Study " , Jonathan Cole et al ; " Transport and Fluid Mechanics in Artificial Organs " , Ed Leonard et al ( V5#13 ) ; as well as Computer Science Colloquia . )
Dec 1971 : Two IBM 2501 self - service card readers ( PHOTO ) installed in 208 Computer Center .
" The use of self - service card readers affords CUCC users much greater security for their decks at both the submission and the retrieval points of running a job .
Users will be able to read in their own decks and keep them while the job is running -- thereby eliminating the risk of loss or mishandling of the deck by the Center .
Also , since input decks no longer need be left in the output bins , the exposure of users ' JOB cards -- and therefore their project numbers -- to anauthorized persons [ some things never change ] will be significantly reduced .
In addition to this increased security , the 2501's will also provide greater efficiency since the user will be able to discover and correct immediately such problems as off - punched cards [ hanging and pregnant chad were evidently not an issue in 1971 ] , rather than having to wait for the job to be processed by the Center . " ( V6#year19 ) Also on the second floor was an IBM 360 Model 20 used for printing card decks onto fanfold paper , duplicating card decks , and so on ; the desired function could be selected with a dial .
There was ( and had been for some time ) a key punch room on the first floor .
Later the Model 20 was moved to the key punch room .
Apr 1972 : TPMON installed , allows terminal lines to be switched among different applications such as Wylbur ( and what else ? ) rather than dedicated to a specific one .
Sep 1972 : IBM OS / 360 21.0 installed ( V6#33 ) .
1973 : The following was posted by Arthur T. Murray on alt.folklore.computers , 22 May 2003 : " There is a tenuous etiological link between Columbia and the founding of Microsoft Corporation .
Here in Seattle WA USA , a Columbia Ph.D. grad in astronomy , Dr. James R. Naiden -- now in his late eighties -- around 1973 was teaching Latin at The Lakeside School .
' Doc ' Naiden observed that the students were eager to get into computers , so he asked ( Naiden was always starting things , e.g. , he hired Vilem Sokol to run the Seattle Youth Symphony for many years ; he also started a history - of - literature or some such group , still allegedly running at the University of Washington ) the Lakeside Mothers Club to donate some money from their annual Lakeside Rummage Sale to buying some computer time - share for the kids -- back then there were no personal computers .
The Mothers put up one thousand dollars , which Bill Gates and Paul Allen ran through in a matter of weeks .
Upshot : Columbia >> Doc Naiden >>
Lakeside School >> Microsoft Corp . " Jan 1973 : V6 # 46 mentions twenty - five IBM 2741 terminals being replaced by ( presumably compatible ) Anderson - Jacobson 841 terminals , which were cheaper to rent ( $ 88 versus $ 100 per month ) .
Feb 1973 : The Self - Service Input / Output ( SSIO ) Area ( PHOTO GALLERY ) is opened on the first floor of the Computer Center building .
Equipment included two card readers , two IBM 1403 printers , one online card punch ( NEED PHOTO ) , a sorter , a collator , an interpreter , a duplicator , four Hazeltine 2000 user terminals , and one job inquiry console -- all " self service " -- plus a large number of IBM 029 key punches , and a resident " Insultant " whom I remember well from my student days .
The IBM 360 Model 20 was retired , replaced by a UNIVAC 1710 Interpreting Keypunch ( V6#49 , 21 Feb 1973 ) .
Now , for the first time , users could not only submit their own jobs but also get the results themselves as soon as the job had run .
Sometimes , standing in line at the card readers , were social scientists with " data sets " spanning 4 or 5 boxes of cards ( 2000 cards per box ) ; submitting jobs of this size rarely proceeded without incident ( jams , dropped decks ) .
The normal student Open Batch job deck was a quarter inch thick and generally went through the system quickly .
A Hazeltine 2000 ASP Job Inquiry station let you watch your job rise through the queue so you could elbow your way through the crowd to the printer when your job output started .
Every night from 7 to 9 pm was " System Time " , meaning the Systems Group from Watson Lab had the 360/91 to themselves and the readers and printers were shut down .
The SSIO area was a miserable place during those two hours .
More about SSIO HERE .
More about self - service computing just below in the entry for Sep 1973 .
22 May 1973 : Birth of Ethernet ( a local area networking technology that would reach Columbia in the early 1980s and persist for decades ) , developed by Bob Metcalfe of Xerox Palo Alto Research Center ( PARC ) , which also gave us the graphical user interface and desktop metaphor .
May 1973 : Resignation of Joe Gianotti ( Assistant Director ) , Ira Fuchs ( systems programmer , who would go on to direct the CUNY facility and to found BITNET , become President of CREN , etc. ) , Aron Eisenpress , Ben Yalow , and other members of the Systems group , to join Ken King at CUNY , which was acquiring brand - new then - leading - edge IBM 370/168 hardware ( V6#54 ) .
Soon more would follow .
May 1973 : Dr. Bruce Gilchrist is appointed the new Director of the Columbia University Computer Center ( he would assume full - time duties in July ) .
He also receives an appointment to the faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science .
Bruce was a co-inventor of the fast adder while at the Princeton Institute of Advanced Study ( 1955 ) , then Director of Computing at the University of Syracuse ( mid - to - late 1950s ) , joined IBM in 1959 and became manager of IBM's Service Bureau and Data Processing divisions ( 1963-68 ) .
While at IBM Bruce was Secretary and then Vice President of the Association for Computing Machinery , ACM ( 1960 - 64 ) , and afterwards was President and Executive Director of the American Federation of Information Processing Societies , AFIPS ( 1968 -73 ) .
His final project at Columbia was the installation of the $ 20 - million - dollar IBM / Rolm Computerized Branch Exchange , not just the University 's first digital telephone system , but also the way that almost every single room ( inclusing in dormitories ) on the Morningside campus got high - speed data access .
Sep 1973 : Bruce introduced the Open Batch system ( V6#60 ) , opening up " The Computer " to the masses for the first time , and renamed CUCC ( Columbia University Computer Center ) to CUCCA ( Columbia University Center for Computing Activities ) , in recognition that computing was beginning to take place outside the machine room .
SSIO soon became unbelievably crowded .
Oct 1973 : The IBM 1410 is removed [ 19 ] .
1974 : Snapshot :
When I came to the CUCCA Systems Group in 1974 , Dr. Howard Eskin was manager of Systems ( 197 ? - 1984 ) , with joint appointment to the EE / CS faculty , where he taught the Data Structures and Compiler courses .
The big languages for systems programming then were 360 assembler , APL , PL / I and SPITBOL ( a SNOBOL dialect ) .
CUCCA included both academic and administrative computing under a single director , all in the Watson building at 612 W 115th Street .
Administrative computing ( ADP ) shared floors 2 - 5 with the Purchasing Office ; the Director 's office and administrative was staff on 6 , academic on 7 - 8 .
Offices had chalkboards for scribbling ideas and diagrams .
The Systems Group ( where I worked ) was on the 7th floor , 2 - 3 people to a room , each room with a single shared Hazeltine terminal , connected at 1200 bps to a multiplexer in the back of 7 that was connected by leased telephone line to the 3705 in the machine room , and that always conked out on rainy days .
There was no e-mail .
The Penthouse was a kind of cafeteria , with tables and chairs ( I remember checkered tablecloths and gingham curtains ) and a working , if rarely - used , kitchen .
The back of the first floor was a large classroom ( now divided into the network and mail rooms ) ; across from the elevator was a big Xerox copying room ( Joe Iglesias ) , and there was a grand lobby and reception area , approximately where the " art gallery " is now , plus some administrative offices ( Helen Ransower ) .
There was a shower in the basement ( later converted to a darkroom by Andy Koenig , and later to a weight - lifting room by Lloyd , the messenger / front - desk guy , an Olympic hopeful ) .
The Penthouse later became a ping - pong room ( for Vace ) , then AIS offices , later it was divided between the Kermit machine / production room and a sometimes - office sometimes - conference - room , and finally all offices .
The back of the 7th floor was an IBM machine room dating from the 1950s , complete with raised floor , " space phone " floor - tile pullers , and communication cables radiating out to all the offices .
The famous 1957 book about IBM , Think [ 8 ] , speaks of teak paneling and cozy fireplaces , but those were in the first Watson Lab , not this one .
In those days , the Computer Center had a certain academic standing not only through faculty appointments , but also for its R&D activities and library .
The non-circulating research library ( not to be confused with the Thomas J Watson Library of the Business School ) in room 209 of the Computer Center Building was a full - fledged branch of the Columbia Library , complete with card catalog and librarian ( the original librarians were Julia Jann and Hugh Seidman ; Nuala Hallinan [ 20 ] was librarian from 1966 to 1973 , succeeded by Evelyn Gorham ) .
The holdings , cataloged in Butler Library , included computer science books and journals as well as computer manuals and Computer Center handouts [ 25 ] .
New acquisitions continued until at least 1973 .
Eventually ( about 1980 ) the collection was transferred to the Engineering Library .
Several technical staff members performed pure R&D , for example Richard Siegler who worked half - time on an AI medical diagnosis assistant in SPITBOL with Dr. Rifkin at the Medical Center .
An annual catalog , the Columbia University Bulletin , Computing Activities [ 7 ] was published , as well as a Technical Abstract of each year 's research projects .
CUCCA was co-sponsor ( with EE / CS ) of the University Colloquium in Computer Science .
There was an alliance with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center on 112th Street ( Tom 's Restaurant building ) , which had one of the four existing IBM 360/95s .
The academic user community was quite small .
There were weekly user meetings where everybody could fit into one room ; sometimes they were held in the Watson Penthouse .
1974 - 78 : Heyday of Wylbur , and the age of the Hazeltine 2000 video terminal mainly on Olympus ( aside from four Hazeltines available to users in 208 Computer Center : V6 # 22 ) .
Wylbur was an interactive linemode editor that could be used from a hardcopy or video terminal .
It was far more than an editor , however ; it was the equivalent of the latter - day " shell " ; users lived in Wylbur all day , writing Wylbur execs ( like shell scripts ) , programs , and JCL ; submitting jobs , querying jobs , sending screen messages ( but not e-mail ) to each other , and so on .
Wylbur originally came from Stanford but was improved beyond recognition by Dave Marcus and later Vace Kundakci , who also converted it to TSO and later to VM / CMS .
It 's still used today on our IBM mainframes , but unfortunately we could never export it due to licensing issues .
Eventually Wylbur terminals -- hardwired to the 3705 -- were available to departments ; sometimes these were video terminals , sometimes IBM 2741 ( IBM hardcopy terminals made from Selectric typewriters ) .
When developing software on the mainframe , writing in assembler , Fortran , PL / I , etc ( compiled , not interpreted , languages ) , programs would often " dump core " because of faulty instructions ( bugs , mistakes ) .
In those days , a core dump meant a literal dump of literal core memory to the printer , in hex , sometimes several feet thick .
To find the fault , programmers would have to decode the core dump from the listing by hand , separating instructions , addresses , and data -- a lost art ( and good riddance ! )
When the DEC - 20s arrived on the scene , it became possible to analyze and debug core images ( and even running programs ) interactively and symbolically with a tool called ( what else ) DDT , and debugging tasks that once took days or weeks became quick and even fun .
DDT - like tools live on today in Unix as ' adb ' and ' gdb ' .
May 1974 : Snapshot : Wylbur has 500 users .
CALL /360 has 50 - 100 users .
There are 2000 batch users .
50 % of each programmer 's time is spent helping users .
ADP submits 10 % of the batch jobs but uses 50 % of the machine .
Because of their EAM backgrounds , the Registrar 's and Controller 's Offices consider the 360/91 a " large sorter " .
90 % of billing is for funny money .
Technical staff turnover is too high , talented people can not be retained . [ 33 ] 1974 - 75 : First " proof of concept " home computers introduced ( Mark - 8 , Altair ) .
1975 : IBM 3705 communications front end replaced by an NCR COMTEN ( which lasted until August 1998 ) , after a two - week training course in the Watson Lab classroom in the back of the 1st floor .
Jul 1975 : A DEC PDP - 11/50 minicomputer ( PHOTOS ) was installed , running the RSTS / E timesharing system ( we considered UNIX , but it was not nearly ready for large - scale production use in a hostile environment ) .
This was the first true general - purpose public - access timesharing system ( not counting APL and CALL / OS ( aka CALL / 360 ) , which were both OS / 360 subsystems ( essentially batch jobs , each of which controlled a number of terminals simultaneously ) ; the latter was only for the Business School and APL , though open to the public , required special terminals which were not to be found in abundance , and was not exactly user friendly ) .
RSTS/E was to be a small pilot project to absorb the CALL / OS users and attract new ones .
32 people could use it at a time ( because it had 32 terminals ) .
Accounts were free .
Within a few months of installation , it was already logging nearly ten times the usage that CALL / OS had at its peak [ 19 ] .
( From " Bandit " , 6 July 2010 ) CALL / 360 was written for Buck Rogers of IBM by seven guys who had worked together at GE in Phoenix , then moved to the San Jose Bay Area .
They wrote CALL / 360 for a fixed - price , 10 month contract .
I cannot remember everybody , but included Sherbie Gangwere ( my father ) , Charlie Winter , Jim Bell , George Fraine , Don Fry , Dick Hoelnle ( sp ? ) and ???
( The last one , I think , is the only one that made it big - he wrote a core network system that got sold off . )
Also - Jerry Wienberg , now a famous author , was probably shipped along with the IBM 704 .
He was sent with the first 10 machines , and taught many how to program it .
The primary programming language ( like in CALL / OS ) was BASIC ( another reason why RSTS was chosen over UNIX , which did n't have BASIC ) , but Fortran and Macro - 11 were also available .
As I recall , the PDP - 11/50 cost about $ 150,000 .
It occupied a fairly large room ( 208 ) in the Computer Center down the hall from the IBM machine room , and was comprised of four full - width cabinets ( CPU , tape drive , communications , I forget what else ) and a 92MB RP04 3330 - type disk drive , plus a 2 K fixed - head drive for swapping ( RS04 ? ) .
I took care of it myself ( backups and all ) for maybe a year , then Ben Beecher joined me and later also some part - timers .
Ben and I sat in the room with it full - time for a couple years .
Our terminals were DECwriters ( later VT05 , VT50 , VT52 , and finally VT100 , and at one point a GE Terminet , that worked and sounded like a bandsaw ) .
But even without the Terminet , the room was so loud we had to wear airport ear - protectors .
Ben was RSTS manager after the DEC - 20s came in 1977 .
Eventually RSTS had a user population of 1700 .
It was retired in 1982 .
Jul 1975 : The IBM 1410 in the Controller 's Office is replaced by an IBM 370/115 [ 19 ] .
Mid 1970s : Here begins the decline of centralized campus computing .
Minicomputers begin to sprout in the departments , encouraged by government grants that would buy equipment but would n't pay for central computer time .
( The same trend was evident at other universities ; it created the need for campus networking , and thus -- since a way was needed to interconnect all these campus networks -- the Internet . )
Some of the early departmental minis I remember were the SEL 810B , Applied Physics also had an Imlac graphics processor ( which never worked ) and several early PDP - 8 models for controlling experiments .
In the late 1960s and early 1970s , I worked in Applied Physics and used the departmental computers for both work and EE / CS projects .
The SEL ( Systems Engineering Laboratories , later Gould ) 810B ( 1968 ) was the most advanced , since it had i/o devices and could be programmed in Fortran and assembly language .
It had 16 K of memory , 2 registers , Teletype , paper tape , card reader , drum printer , and an oscilloscope - like CRT display for graphics ; CLICK HERE to see a picture of the SEL 810A , which is like the 810 B but without extra i/o devices .
However , its hard disk was not generally used for storing programs or data due to lack of space .
Instead , programs were read from cards or paper tape ; this required toggling in a bootstrap program on the console switches : a series of 16 - bit words was deposited in successive memory locations and then executed to activate the Teletype as the control device , which could be used in turn to activate the card or paper tape reader to read the program .
Production programs were generally punched in object format onto paper tape ( since the paper tape reader / punch was much faster than the card reader ) .
CLICK HERE to see the SEL 810B Manual .
The PDP - 8 computers in the same lab had no Teletype , card reader , or paper tape ; they were programmed directly from the console switches and i/o was magtape only .
The Physics Department in Pupin Hall had a DEC PDP - 4 , several PDP - 8s , a PDP - 9 , and a PDP - 15 ; Electrical Engineering had a PDP - 7 on the 12th floor of Mudd , that we studied down to the gate level in the 1970s EE / CS Computer Architecture course .
( The PDP - 7 is also the machine for which the UNIX operating was originally written at Bell Labs in the late 1960s . )
The keypunch room was on the 2nd floor of Engineering Terrace near the back exit , connected by tunnel to the SSIO area .
There were often long waits for punches .
The 1976 Bulletin [ 7 ] also lists : A DEC PDP - 11/45 and GT /40 Graphics Computer in Biology ( Schermerhorn ) .
A HP 2100 in Chemical Engineering ( Prentis ) .
A DG Nova 1220 and 3 DEC PDP - 8s in Chemistry ( Havemeyer ) .
A DG Super Nova in EE / CS ( Mudd ) .
plus various special - purpose computers for Fourier transforms , etc , some of them possibly analog ( rather than digital ) on campus , as well as all sorts of computing equipment at the outlying campuses ( no doubt a tale in itself ) .
1976 : Andy Koenig 's RSTS e-mail program , the first e-mail at CU .
Andy was a prominent member of the CUCCA technical staff ( reponsible for at least APL and PL / I ) who went on to Bell Labs and fame with C++.
His dad is Dr. Seymour H. Koenig , who was at Watson Lab from 1952 to 1970 , and its director from 1967 [ 9,17 ] .
Andy 's frequent co-author is Barbaro Moo , also formerly of CUCCA .
( Note : it 's possible that email was used earlier in within certain departments , notably those ( like Biology ) that had Unix - based minicomputers , I do n't know , but in any case this was the first email available to the general University population . )
Nowadays most of the University conducts its business by e-mail , and it has been an enormous productivity booster , eliminating telephone tag , enabling one - to - many messaging , and filling an ever - increasing role in instruction and research .
As early as 1983 ( the 9 Feb 1983 Newsletter , V15 # 2 , is full of allusions to this ) , professors were sending assignments to their classes by e-mail and collecting results the same way , with the added benefit of questions and answers and other discussions that could not fit in the classroom schedule .
Readers who were not exposed to electronic mail prior to the Internet explosion of the mid-1990s probably wo n't appreciate how much more useful and pleasant it was before then , even in its original text - only format .
Today I typically have several hundred messages waiting for me each morning ( after central filtering ! ) , of which 98 % are spam , advertisements , promotions , junk mail , get - rich - quick schemes , invitations to Exclusive High - Powered Executive Webcasts and Enterprise Leadership Webinars , chain letters , be - my - friend - and - share - photos , inspirational Powerpoints , strategic partnerships , " office humor " , world class enterprise solutions , body - part enhancements , business best practices , claim your lottery winnings , claim your inheritance , claim your fund , " Dear beloved " , " I am dying , I do n't want you to feel sorry for me " , " Beloved in Christ " , " Dear beneficiary " , " Complements of the season " , confidential matter , delinquent accounts , cash grant award , designer watches , investment opportunities , work - at - home opportunities , get your diploma , grow your business , increase your profitability , " Dear entrepreneur " , " Take this five - minute survey " , offers from soldiers in our many wars who found barrels full of money , " I want to place an order with your store " , low - interest loans , " your account is expired " , Viagra , Cialis , lonely hearts , Russian beauties , " update your information " , bounce notifications about mail you did n't send , and deliberate attempts at implanting viruses ( Windows e-mail attachments containing viruses or worms have no effect on my UNIX - based plain - text mail client ) -- or security alerts or complaints about all of these .
In the 1970s and 80s , by contrast , practically every e-mail message was legitimate , worth reading , and usually only 1 - 2 K bytes in length , and could not possibly hurt your computer ( not strictly true ; it was possible to put an escape sequence in an email message that , if it arrived intact at certain kinds of terminals , could make them automatically transmit any desired text back to the host , but even if you had a terminal that responded to the escape sequence , this rarely could cause any serious demage because an email client would be on the receiving end , not the system command prompt ) .
Even when e-mail is exchanged between consenting parties , the demands posed by multimedia attachments -- Microsoft Word documents , Powerpoints , spreadsheets , images , audio and video clips , even entire music CDs or motion pictures -- have coerced the University to constantly upgrade its network and mail server capacity , and of course the costs are inevitably passed back to the consumer in the form of tuition or overhead increases and / or cutbacks in other areas .
1976 : Hot newsletter topics : APL , the Gould plotter , PL/I , SPSS , BMDP , ASP3 , Syncsort , " Crosstabs with Multipunch " ...
Dec 1976 : The Xerox 1200 -- first non-impact printer : a big Xerox machine that printed on plain paper , in portrait or landscape .
Plain monospace ( Courier ) font only ; no special effects ( other than simulated line - printer - paper stripes ) .
I do n't remember exactly where the input came from -- either it had an IBM mainframe channel connection , or else it read from 9 - track magnetic tape , but in any case it was possible to print on it from both the IBM and DEC systems .
1977 : ( Month ? )
Because the IBM 360/91 was more suited to scientific calculations and lacked decimal arithmetic , and because of security questions posed by the Open Batch system , which opened it up to the student population , ADP acquires a separate mainframe exclusively for administrative work , an IBM 370/138 located in the Computer Center machine room and running VM / CMS ( later to be upgraded to 370/148 , 3031 ( 1979 ) , 3083 ( 1983 ) , 3090 ( 1986 ) , etc ) .
A new Personnel ( now we would say " Human Resources " ) system was developed for the 370 in house , and administrative applications began to migrate from punch cards and batch to interactive online systems [ 20 ] .
The arrival of the IBM 370 launches an effort to convert administrative applications from batch to online , with IBM 3270 block - mode terminals allowing interactive access to administrative systems such as student records , accounts receivable , and so on .
Jul 1977 : The IBM 370/115 in the Controller 's Office is removed .
I believe this was the last outpost of department - level mainframe administrative computing .
Jul 1977 : The blackout of 1977 .
No electricity for two days ( July 13 - 14 ) .
Howard ( Eskin ) and I were in Watson Lab the evening of the 13th working on the floor plan for the 272A Engineering Terrace terminal room when the lights went out .
We were also in the middle of our first DEC - 20 installation , a six - week process ( so two lost days were not a disaster ) .
Aug 1977 : Our PDP - 11/50 was invaded ( via modem ) by a gang of prep - school kids , who had their way with it undetected for several weeks .
This was the first hacker breakin to a Columbia computer from the outside , and it went to court .
It cost us nearly a week of round - the - clock systems work and delayed the DEC - 20 opening by a week .
Later the same group invaded other RSTS systems and even ( as I recall ) destroyed a cement company in Quebec .
The prep school in question had purchased a PDP - 11 with RSTS and let the students run it without supervision ; thus the students had hands - on access and full privileges , with ample opportunity to probe their own system for vulnerabilities , write Trojan - horse replacements for system software , etc , in - house before attacking external sites , and indeed they did a good job : their modified LOGIN program let them in silently , with full " root " privileges ; the modified accounting programs did not list their sessions ; the modified DIRECTORY program did not list their directories or files ; the modified SYSTAT program did not show their jobs , and so on .
Eventually they tipped their hand by accidentally printing a password list on a public printer , and we tracked them down using methods remarkably similar to those used by Cliff Stoll 10 years later to catch the German hackers at Berkeley [ 46 ] ( see 1986 - 87 below ) , such as Y - connecting hardcopy terminals to the modems to log dialin sessions .
Aug 1977 : Our first DECSYSTEM - 20 , CU20A ( PHOTOS ) , was installed for large - scale timesharing .
Accounts were free and available to all ( or maybe there was a one - time $ 5.00 fee ; later , per-semester or per-course fees would be added ) .
It cost 800,000 dollars [ 19 ] and was much larger than the PDP - 11 , a row of double - width orange cabinets about 10 feet long , plus four 178MB RP06 washing - machine - size 3350 - type disk drives , but unlike the PDP - 11 , had little in the way of lights and switches ( if you did n't count the PDP - 11/40 communications front end hidden inside it ) .
It had 256K 36 - bit words of main memory , two 800/ 1600 bpi TU45 tape drives ( later TU77 , TU78 ) , an LP20 drum printer ( mainly for backup listings ) , and an LA36 system console hardcopy terminal .
It also had a DN20 communications processor ( PDP - 11/34 concealed in orange full - size cabinet ) for remote job entry ( see Glossary ) to the IBM mainframes .
CU20A was originally a model 2040 , and so it had core memory and no cache ; later it was upgraded to a 2050 and then a 2065 ; the core became MOS and cache was added , memory increased to 2MB .
Each user got 35KB ( that 's KB , not MB or GB ) of disk space .
The first DEC - 20 marked the beginning of the " online campus " in which the computer was used not just for calcalation and programming , but also communication among users and ( eventually ) with the outside world .
The DEC - 20 was a member of the DEC 's 36 - bit PDP - 10 line of computers , which descended from the PDP - 6 , first produced in 1964 , and which itself has its roots in the 36 - bit IBM 700 series that goes back to 1952 .
PDP - 10s , however , were distinct from 20s : they had a different operating system ( TOPS - 10 instead of TOPS - 20 ) ; they came in a variety of models ( KA , KI , KL , KS ) , whereas DEC - 20s came in only KL and KS models ; PDP - 10s were more suited to hands - on lab work , with all sorts of devices and attachments lacking from the - 20s such as real - time bus - attached instruments ; DECtapes , paper tape , and graphics devices ; they could be installed in multiprocessor configurations ; and they were blue rather than orange .
DEC - 20s could run TOPS - 10 applications in an " emulation mode " , but not vice versa , and until the very end , quite a bit of DEC - 20 software was indeed native to TOPS - 10 ( e.g. the linker and most of the compilers ) .
The DEC - 20 pioneered all sorts of advanced concepts such as a swappable monitor ( kernel ) , lightweight processes ( threads ) , page mapping , shared pages with copy - on - write , hardware assisted paging , and other techniques to allow large numbers of users access to a limited resource ( CLICK HERE for details ) .
Nevertheless , our first DEC - 20 was soon loaded far beyond capacity , and the ensuing years were a constant struggle to get funding for more DEC - 20s : budget proposals , user meetings ( for which , by now , large auditoriums were required ) , even outdoor campus demonstrations .
But DEC - 20s were expensive ; they demanded copious floor space and air conditioning , as well as 3 - phase power with isolated ground ( a 10 - foot copper stake literally driven into bedrock outside the CUCCA loading dock ) .
Annual maintenance alone was something like $ 100,000 per machine , and each one carried an additional $ 10,000 electric bill .
Therefore adding DEC - 20s was difficult and painful .
There were all sorts of revenue - raising schemes and eventually we had 4 of them , CU20A through CU20D , serving 6000 users , up to 70 or 80 logged in simultaneously on each .
Additional DEC - 20s for instruction and research were installed at Teachers College and in the Computer Science department .
DEC - 20s were fairly reliable for their day .
Unlike the IBM mainframe with its scheduled two - hour nightly System Time , the DEC - 20s were kept running and available all the time except for a couple hours ( usually outside of prime time ) every week or two for " preventive maintenance " by DEC Field Service .
But by today 's standards they crashed frequently anyway , usually because of power glitches ; so often , in fact that somebody had a batch of %DECSYSTEM - 20 NOT RUNNING T - shirts made up ( this was the dying gasp of the DEC - 20 as it went down ) .
Whenever a DEC - 20 was up for more than 100 hours , people became quite excited .
The record was just shy of 800 hours ( about a month ) ; MTBF was under 100 hours ( 4 days ) .
By comparison , today ( 8 Feb 2001 ) I have an HP workstation in my office that has been up continuously for 883 days ( that 's more than 21,000 hours ) , despite numerous brownouts and momentary power failures , and that 's without a UPS ( eventually its running streak was interrupted at 900 - some days when electricians needed to shut off power to the floor to replace the circuit - breaker panel ) .

( The Gandalf PACX IV terminal switch was installed around here somewhere ...
Prior to that terminals were hardwired using various forgotten technologies like 20 mA Current Loop .
The PACX was a speed - transparent 1000x1000 switch , driven by little blue " PACX boxes " on the user end , with thumbwheels to dial the desired service and an on / off switch . )
1977 - 78 : Use of e-mail takes off .
Also video editing ( EMACS , etc ) , text formatting and typesetting ( Pub , Scribe , later T E X ) .
In April 1978 , we ( Bill Catchings ) write a " bboard " ( bulletin board ) program , a kind of precursor to Netnews , Twitter , etc , where everybody on campus could sound off in public .
Various bboards were available , including course - specific boards , topical boards , and a " general " ( any topic ) board , and were unmoderated and uncensored .
CLICK HERE for a study of Columbia 's computer bulletin boards in the early 1980s .
EMACS , by the way , was created at the MIT AI Lab on a PDP - 10 running MIT 's Incompatible Timesharing System ( ITS ) by Richard Stallman , building upon the venerable Text Editor and COrrector , TECO , written in 1962 - 63 for the DEC PDP - 1 by Dan Murphy , who was also largely responsible for TOPS - 20 , the operating system on our DECSYSTEM - 20s .
I first used TECO in 1972 on a PDP - 11/20 with the DOS / Batch operating , at the Teletype console .
The first release of EMACS was in 1976 and we were using it at Columbia on CU20A by 1977 .
Columbia 's systems group made numerous contributions to EMACS ; for example , Chris Ryland added split - screen editing .
In the 1980s EMACS would be completely rewritten in LISP , to become the now - universal GNU EMACS , one of the most prominent surviving relics of the heyday of the DEC 36 - bit mainframes .
Jan 1978 : The 272A Engineering Terrace terminal room opens ( V10# 2 ) .
This was the first public terminal room outside the Computer Center building .
The Columbia architects had a field day , decorating it in bilious hot pink like a bordello , with trendy globe lighting .
( The April Fools 1978 issue of the Newsletter ( V10 # 5 ) presents the " coveted Louis XVI Alive with the Arts " award to the Department of Buildings and Grounds [ now Facilities Management ] for " their exceptional work in recreating the atmosphere of an 18th century French palace .
...
Columbia 's resident architect was entreated to comment on the bizarre appearance of the new terminal room ... " )
Notwithstanding the decor , the room was laid out according to our floorplan ( Howard Eskin and I designed it ) , divided into cubicles about 4 feet high so people would have privacy when sitting , but could stand up to chat and hand things back and forth .
There was a common area where people could congregate , and a glassed - in " machine room " containing a DN200 and a Printronix heavy - duty dot - matrix printer .
Each cubicle had a terminal and a spacious working surface for books and papers and its own reading light .
Large cubicles had LA36 DECwriters ( hard - copy 132 - column dot - matrix printers operating at 30 cps on pin-feed green - and - white striped fanfold paper ) and the smaller ones had Perkin - Elmer Fox -1100 CRTs operating at 9600 bps ( this was the first affordable CRT , costing about $ 500 , compared to most others that cost a thousand dollars and up ) .
Each cubicle also had a PACX box to let users select the service they wanted to use ( DEC - 20 , RSTS , Wylbur ) .
Eventually the lab was re-architected , expanded , and . . .
REDECORATED .
Too bad if you missed it ( does anybody have a color photo of the original ? )
Mar 1978 : APL conversion from IBM to DEC - 20 was a big topic for many months .
Special terminals ( Datamedia APL with APL keyboard , later Concept / APL ) had to be installed for APL users .
To further encourage IBM to DEC migration , I wrote a mini-Wylbur ( " Otto " ) for the DEC - 20 ; Joel and his brother worked on a full Wylbur implementation for some time but it 's not done yet .
Apr 1978 : The CUCCA Telephone Directory and Consulting Schedule .
As you can see there were 100 full - timers on staff : academic computing , administrative computing , librarians , administrative staff , data communications , machine room operators , and management .
Compared to 15 in 1965 and over 300 in 2010 .
Note too that in those days the technical staff helped users in person in three locations ( two in SSIO , one in Mudd ) and at other times they answered calls from users on their own phones — no call processing , no screening , no trouble tickets , no hiding behind web pages , no bureacracy .
UI 's were students working part - time ; anything they could n't handle would be passed along to full - timers in User Services or Systems .
Many of the UI 's listed on the schedule went on to become full timers and some even managers .
( Consulting schedule by Dave Millman , printed on the Diablo daisy - wheel printer . )
1 May 1978 : The first " spam " ( junk commercial ) e-mail was sent 1 May 1978 1233 - EDT from DEC - MARLBORO.ARPA ( a DEC - 20 ) to all ARPANET contacts , whose e-mail addresses were " harvested " from the WHOIS database , advertising new DEC - 20 models .
More about this HERE .
May 1978 : OS / 360 21.8 ( which was released by IBM in 1970 ) installed on the IBM 360/91 .
Eight years in the making !
The ex-CUCC systems people who defected to CUNY had to come back and teach nightly classes on OS / 360 and what they had done to it ( many things , including over 200 modifications for accounting and resource - limitation purposes ) before their replacements could bring up the new release without fear of losing something vital .
May 1978 : Tektronix 4010 graphics a big topic in the newlsetters .
( Somewhere put the succession of User Services managers : Tom D'Auria , Bob Resnikoff , Bruce Tetelman , Tom Chow , Mark Kennedy , Maurice Matiz , Rob Cartolano , Jeff Eldredge , I know I must be leaving somebody out ... ) and SSIO ( Marianne Clarke , Lois Dorman , Chris Gianone , ... ) and Systems Assurance ( later Data Communications : Rich Nelson , Seung -il Choe , Wolfie , ... ) and CUCCA business managers ( Peter Bujara , Neil Sachnoff , Patty Peters , Bob Bingham , Julie Lai ... )
About User Services , Maurice Matiz adds :
User Services existed only up to early in my era .
After Vace 's appointment and my appointment ( I believe the only two managerial and higher level appointments that required a trying and complete interview by the whole University occurred in late 1989 ) did the groups that now define AcIS get created except that User Services comprised three groups .
User Services stayed until Jeff Eldrege 's group was spun out of my group , which had grown to over 25 people , in late 1994 .
( My diagramed proposal is dated 11/28/94 . )
At that time we changed names .
Jeff 's group became the Support Center and my group was renamed Academic Technologies .
Also spun out at the time was what became EDS to report to Walter Bourne .
Dec 1978 : First mention of UNIX by CUCCA in public ( referring to the BSTJ UNIX issue [ 15 ] ) .
V10 #18 .
1979 : The Computer Science Department was created as a separate entity ( previously it was part of the EE Dept ) with Joseph Traub from CMU as Chair , and a $ 200,000 donation from IBM .
Joe had been a Watson Fellow in Applied Mathematics in 1958 - 59 [ 9 ] .
The Computer Science Building was constructed 1981 - 83 [ 12 ] .
Before long a DECSYSTEM - 20 , several VAX - 11/750s , and numerous workstations ( early Suns and others ) would be installed in the new CS facility .
Jan 1979 : Public terminals were available in SSIO ( 20 ) , 272A Engineering Terrace ( 14 ) , Furnald Lobby ( 4 ) , 224 Butler ( 4 ) , and Hartley Lobby ( 4 ) .
V11#2 . Systems Assurance staff ( Bob Galanos ) would make the rounds on a daily basis to fix broken terminals , usually by replacing fuses taken out by students to " reserve " terminals for their own use .
Feb 1979 : Scribe , Diablo , printwheel lore dominates the Newsletter .
Big business in printwheels .
The Diablo was a typewriter - like terminal with a daisy - wheel print mechanism capable of proportional spacing , superscripts and subscripts , and even boldface ( by doublestriking ) and italics ( by swapping printwheels ) .
The CUCCA newsletter was printed on the Diablo for some years , and Diablos were deployed in public areas for users .
Scribe included a Diablo driver , which produced .
POD ( " Prince Of Darkness " ) files for it , and we wrote software to " spool " these files to the Diablo itself , allowing pauses to change paper or printwheels .
Printwheels were available in a variety of fonts and alphabets , but were n't cheap ( $ 98 springs to mind ) .
Aug 1979 : COMND JSYS package written for SAIL ( so we could write user - friendly programs for the DEC - 20 in a high - level language ) .
Andy Lowry and David Millman .
Sep 1979 : HP2621 industrial - strength video terminals installed in Mudd and elsewhere , including a new lab in Carman Hall .
This was the face of CUCCA to our users ; many of them thought the DEC - 20s were made by HP .
These are monochrome text terminals with good editing capabilties ( for EMACS ) and solidly built .
Some had built - in thermal printers .
A few units are still to be found here in good working order .
1979 - 80 : Chris Ryland and I write a 200 - plus - page guide to DEC - 20 assembly - language programming .
We were thinking of turning it into a book but Ralph Gorin of Stanford University beat us to it .

1980 : Instructional computing capacity badly needs expansion .
At this point , CUCCA has three instructional systems : the IBM 360/91 Open Batch system ( soon to be retired ) , the PDP - 11/50 ( fully saturated ) , and a single DECSYSTEM - 20 , CU20A , which is in constant demand and heavily overburdened .
There is much gathering of statistics to understand usage patterns .
In response to student and faculty demands , the Collery Committee ( Arnold Collery was Dean of Columbia College ) was appointed to make recommendations .
The instructional computers were overloaded , but why ?
Was the new usage real or frivolous ?
A witch - hunt was launched against " text processing " ( preparing papers on the computer , sending e-mail , etc ) .
Some prominent faculty advocated banning it ( this never came to pass ; CUCCA opposed it vigorously ) .
CPU and connect - time limits were to be instituted .
Fees were to be increased .
Various disincentives would be established against using the computers during " prime time . "
The tug of war between demand and resources is a persistent theme in academic computing .
There has never been , and probably never will be , a clear linkage between demand and supply .
Whenever resources ( such as computer time , disk space , modems , network bandwidth ) become scarce , as they always do , funding for expansion does not flow automatically ( nor should it ) .
First there is a demand for a precise accounting of how , for what , and by whom the current resources are being consumed , the gathering of which in turn taxes the resources still futher .
Once the information is obtained , demands to flush out inappropriate use -- whose definition varies with the times ( e.g. network capacity versus Napster in 2000 ) -- quickly follow .
Of course instructional computing on the DEC - 20s was true to this pattern .
CU20A drove itself near to melting by accounting for itself .
And then complicated limits were imposed on CPU time , connect time , and every other imaginable resource ( using locally written software ) until the interactive computing experience was surpassingly unpleasant for everyone : students , faculty , and staff alike .
Relief was still more than a year away .
One of the measures taken to alleviate the load on CU20A was to abolish the free perpetual student user IDs and replace them with class - related IDs that lasted only for the duration of each course .
While this ensured that the DEC - 20 was used only for " legitimate " purposes , it also made it impossible for students to build up a corpus of tools and information they could use throughout their Columbia experience .
A series of discussions took place throughout 1980 exploring different possibilites for providing students with some form of self - service , inexpensive , removeable media .
The result was Kermit .
Jan 1980 : CUCCA announces its intention to connect to ARPANET , V12# 1 ( but without any firm prospects of doing so , since in those days the only entree was a big Defense Department grant , which we did n't have and did n't want ) .
In the meantime , however , staff ( but not end - users ) had access through our DECnet link to COLUMBIA - 20 .
ARPA , the Computer Science DEC - 20 ( July 1983 ) , and prior to that by dialup to the NYU Elf and guest accounts at Rutgers , Harvard , Stanford , CMU and elsewhere .
The ARPANET was important , among other reaons , because it was how DECsystem - 10 and DECSYSTEM - 20 software developers could work together ( by email ) and share code ( by FTP ) , and this was the beginning of the open software movement .
It is important to recall that in those days we were paid to develop and share software .
Nowadays most open ( " free " ) software is created by unpaid volunteers .
Feb 1980 : DECnet first operational ( between CU20A and the DN200 in Mudd ) .
Feb 1980 : The DEC - 20 MM ( Mail Manager ) e-mail program becomes popular ( V12#2 ) .
This is a good example of software created by professional staff or graduate students at PDP - 10 and DEC - 20 sites on the ARPANET ( Stanford in this case ) and freely shared with other sites .
Other examples of the era included the ISPELL spelling checker and corrector ( also from Stanford ) , the EMACS text editor from MIT , the SCRIBE text formatting and typesetting system from CMU ( which later became commercial ) and TeX from Stanford , the Bliss - 10 programming language from CMU , the SAIL programming language from Stanford , the PASCAL compiler from Rutgers , the SITGO instructional FORTRAN package from Stevens Institute of Technology , various LISP systems from different places , and KERMIT communications software from Columbia .
In fact , each place contributed bits and pieces to most of these packages so most of them were truly cooperative efforts .
MM was used almost universally at Columbia for E-mail from 1980 until about 1995 , with usage trailing off thereafter as Windows and the Web took over from text - based computer access .
When the DEC - 20 line was cancelled , we wrote a new MM program in C for Unix which again , in the sharing spirit , was made available on the ARPANET ( later Internet ) and adopted by many other sites worldwide as they migrated from TOPS - 20 to Unix .
MM survives even into the 2010s ( details ) .
Jun 1980 : We were considering joining TELENET and TYMNET ( commercial X.3/X.25 based networks ) but never did ; it was way too expensive [ 1 ] .
These were strictly terminal - to - host networks , but would have allowed travellers to dial up with a local call from almost anywhere in the USA or Canada , and conceivably could have taken the place of in - house modem pools .
Sep 1980 : Donald Knuth visits Columbia and gives a series of lectures on T E X , his computer typesetting system .
Oct 1980 : Second DEC - 20 installed , CU20B , for use by funded researchers and staff only ; to be paid for out of income , since the budget request for a second instructional DEC - 20 had been denied , again , even though the first one was seriously overloaded , and despite vocal support from students and faculty ( and us of course ) .
CU20B removed considerable load from CU20A and bought us some time until we finally were able to expand the instructional resources a year later with CU20C .
( In fact , for a short period , we were able to put some students on CU20B , in their own " partition " , isolated from the paying users . )
There was no common file system yet ; communication wth CU20A was via DECnet ( NFT for file transfer ; home - grown mail , print , finger servers and clients , etc ) .
Nov 1980 : The IBM 360/91/75 is retired , replaced by two IBM 4331s ( PHOTO ) , CUVMA and CUVMB .
These are featureless boxes that are ( as you might expect ) more compact and cheaper to run than the 360/91 ( and lower too , so you can use them as coffee tables ) , and they had a new operating system , VM / CMS , which allowed Virtual Machines ( VM ) to run other operating systems on the same machine , thus keeping our old applications afloat .
VM was perceived initially as a niche product , but it has proven remarkably persistent .
The 360/91 was so big it had to be cut up with chainsaws to get it out of the building .
The Gordian knot of cabling under the floor was unceremoniously disposed of with giant cable snippers the size of posthole diggers .
The computer chunks were trucked away and thrown into acid baths to extract the gold .
Only the 360/91 console was spared .
We had it moved to the lobby of Watson Laboratory and arranged to donate it to the now - defunct Computer Museum in Massachusetts , but it took a year and a half for them to pick it up .
In the interim , bits and pieces were removed by passersby as souvenirs .
( More about this in the June 1982 entry . )
1981 - 82 ADP takes over the remaining pockets of decentralized administrative computing : the student systems in Philosophy Hall and the financial and payroll systems in Hogan Hall , and to some extent also the Health Sciences campus .
Jan 1981 : Superbrains arrive .
The Intertec " Superbrain " had been chosen as the first microcomputer we would deploy publicly , despite its embarrassing name , because its solid single - piece construction made it virtually user - proof , and it did indeed stand up to years of ( ab) use .
It ran CP / M 2.2 , an 8 - bit ( 64 K ) operating system .
Apr 1981 : After a year or two of talking with Howard Eskin and a doctoral student of his ( I forget the name ) about how to archive DEC - 20 data , Bill Catchings and I designed the basic Kermit protocol .
The first Kermit protocol transfer took place on April 29th on a loopback connection between two serial ports on CU20B .

May 1981 : I talk J. Ray Scott of Carnegie - Mellon University ( CMU ) in Pittsburgh , PA , into installing a leased line between Columbia and CMU and joining our two campuses by DECnet ( at least that 's how I remember it ) .
CU and CMU informally but effectively merge their DEC - 20 systems staffs and run common customized applications and subsystems ( esp. the GALAXY spooling system , which we modified to allow printer sharing among multiple DEC - 20s and spooling to the Xerox 9700 ) .
Soon the network , called CCNET , expanded to several other universities , notably Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken , NJ , which played an important role in the development of Kermit protocol and software until 1987 , and produced Kermit programs for DEC 's VMS , TOPS - 10 , and P / OS operating systems .
Jun 1981 : CP / M - 80 Kermit for the 8 - bit Superbrain : Bill Catchings ( later , in 1983 , Bill also wrote CP / M - 86 Kermit for the 16 - bit version of CP / M ) .
Shortly after this , the Superbrain was deployed in Mudd .
It had no applications to speak of besides Kermit , which was used by students to archive their DEC - 20 files onto floppy disks ( the purpose for which was Kermit developed ) .
Floppy disks ( the then - modern 5.25 " ones , not the frisbee - sized ones used on other CP / M micros ) for the Superbrain were sold in SSIO , $ 6.00 each ( ! ) .
Later , but before 16 - bit micros like the IBM PC appeared , we set up ( in Watson Lab ) a " network " of Superbrains sharing a hard disk , with an EMACS - like editor called MINCE and a Scribe - like text formatter called Sribble .
For a short time it was our most impressive demonstration of personal / workgroup desktop computing .
( MINCE later became Epsilon and was popular for some years on DOS PCs . )
12 Aug 1981 : The 16 - bit IBM PC was announced ; the Columbia Computer Center orders 20 of them on Day One , sight unseen .
The IBM logo makes all the difference .
About half of them go to high - profile faculty ( who immediately want them to be able to communicate with our central IBM and DEC mainframes ; hence MS - DOS Kermit ) .
The original PC had a monochrome monitor ( color optional ) , one or two 160 K floppy disks , a small amount of memory ( anywhere from 16 K to 256K ) , two RS - 232 serial interfaces , no hard disk , no networking .
It ran at 4.77MHz , had BASIC built into its ROM ( which could be used without an OS or disk ) , and ran DOS 1.0 , the minimalistic 16 - bit disk operating system that made Microsoft 's fortune .
Within a short amount of time , it had become the computer that would dominate the rest of the century and beyond , and spread over the campus like wildfire .
But it still took some years for the PC to wipe out the VAXes and PDP - 11s in the departments .
Up through the early 90s there were still dozens of VAX / VMS installations ; entire departments and schools ( such as Columbia College ) ran on them , with VT100 terminals or DEC word processors ( PDP - 8 based DECmates ) on their desktops .
The PC has been a mixed blessing .
Untold numbers of people - hours have been lost forever to tinkering -- this slot , that bus ; expanded memory , enhanced memory , extended memory .
. .
Blue Screens Of Death , rebooting , reinstalling the operating system , searching for adapters , hunting for drivers , installing OS and driver upgrades , resolving interrupt conflicts , partitioning disks , backing up disks , adding new devices , configuring networks , fighting application and OS bugs , hunting for patches , fighting viruses , and on and on .
Previously this kind of thing was done by a small central full - time professional staff but now it is done by everybody , all the time , at incalculable cost to productivity and progress .
Plus how many PC users really back up their hard disks ?
Not many in my experience , and it is not uncommon for important un - backed - up files to be lost in a disk crash or similar disaster , thus negating weeks , months , or years of work .
ON THE PLUS SIDE , however , . . . (? ? ?)
My personal theory is that IBM never expected the PC to be so successful .
It was thrown together in a rush by a small group ( not at Watson Laboratory ! ) from off - the - shelf components in an effort to get a foothold in the fast - growing microcomputer market .
This was not IBM 's first personal computer .
Besides the 1956 Auto - Point Computer ( " personal " but by no means desktop ) , IBM had also tried and failed with the 5100 and the CS - 9000 in the 1970s and early 80s , both personal desktop models ( we had some 5100s here ; the CS - 9000 was targeted at chemical engineering applications as I recall , and had a special control panel and interfaces for instruments , but included a 32 - bit CPU and modern programming languages like Pascal , and could easily have been the high - end workstation of the early 1980s ) .
According to a reliable source , IBM originally wanted the PC to have a Motorola 68000 CPU ( which had a simple , flat 32 - bit address space ) like the CS - 9000 , but could not get such a product to market in time , so settled for the Intel 8088 , a 16 - bit segmented architecture with 8 - bit data paths .
Worse , it had a primitive 16 - line interrupt controller , which severely limited the number of devices that could be on the bus .
The rest is history .
I believe that if IBM had known that the PC would dominate the next two , three , four , or more decades , it would have invested more time , money , and thought in the original design .
( Obviously the situation is better in the 21st Century .
Most of the early kinks have been ironed out .
PCs are cheap and reliable .
Any quirks of the architecture are well - hidden from end users , and USB makes life immeasurably better when devices need to be attached .
With Windows the dominant operating system , the main problems now are performance – bloated OS and applications – and security .
And stability . )
Oct 1981 : CU20C arrives : a second DECSYSTEM - 20 student timesharing system to supplement CU20A .
Still no common file system ; each DEC - 20 was a relatively separate world , but at least they were connected by DECnet .
If you had a student user ID , it was on one or the other , not both .
Dec 1981 : HP plotter supplies ( personal ink cartridges , etc ) were a hot topic in the newsletter .
The HP pen plotters installed in Mudd ( and SSIO ? ) came in 4 - and 8 - color models , and there was a wide variety of software for them , including DISSPLA / TEL -A - GRAF on the DEC - 20s and SAS / GRAPH and SPSS on the IBM mainframes that could make 3D plots with hidden - line elimination , fancy fonts , etc .
They were totally mechanical : pen and ink on paper , and could produce beautiful line drawings .
Jan 1982 : J. Ray Scott , Director of the Carnegie - Mellon University Computation Center , writes an article in the CUCCA Newsletter ( V14#1 ) describing the CCNET connection between Columbia and CMU , and CMU 's facilities ( including an ARPANET gateeway and various compilers and applications that had not been licensed at Columbia ) .
In the first example of network - based inter-university resource sharing at Columbia , CU users were invited to apply for user IDs on the CMU systems .
Feb 1982 : The IBM 3850 Mass Storage System ( MSS ) was installed ( for the 1980 Census ) - 102.2 GB .
The MSS was gigantic in every sense , covering most of the South wall of the machine room .
Essentially it was a big honeycomb , each cell holding a cartridge ( PHOTO ) that resembles an M - 79 rifle grenade ( sorry , it does ) containing a winding of 2.7 - inch - wide magtape with a capacity of 50 MB .
A mechanical hand comes and extracts the cartridge and carries it to a reader , which removes the shell , and unwinds the tape and copies it to one of four staging disks ; then the tape is re-wound , the shell replaced , and the cartridge returned to its cell .
All this was transparent to the user ; the MSS looked like a 3330 disk drive to user - mode software .
The disks acted as a cache , so if your file was already on the disk , the little mechanical man did n't need to go get the cartridge .
( Before the MSS , we had an IBM 2321 Data Cell Drive , which worked in a similar way , except instead of cartridges , it used flat strips of tape that were much harder for the little men to handle , so the tape strips were easily mangled . )
Like the 360/91 , there were only a few MSS devices in the world .
The MSS cost about a million dollars , but Columbia got its MSS in an IBM grant .
In return , Columbia would add support for it to IBM 's VM operating system ( in particular , it would add windowing and lookahead features to reduce " cylinder faults " and redundant cartridge fetches , and thus speed up sequential access ; this was done by Bob Resnikoff of the Computer Center and Ates Dagli of the Center for Social Sciences ( CSS ) ) .
CSS was responsible for loading the census data ( which came on endless reels of 9 - track magtape ) and for arranging access to it from within Columbia and from outside ( V14#16 ) .
When the grant expired , Columbia was able to purchase the MSS at a steep discount .
Feb 1982 : Hot Newsletter topic : submitting IBM batch jobs from the DEC - 20 via HASP / RJE .
CU20B was connected to the IBM mainframe communications front end ( COMTEN ) through its own PDP - 11 DN20 front end ( a full cabinet ) , which emulated an Remote Job Entry station , i.e. a card reader for sending data to the mainframe in form of card images , and a line printer for receiving data from the mainframe in the form of print jobs , but using DEC - 20 disk files instead of cards and paper .
The CUCCA systems group developed user - friendly programs for submitting batch jobs to the VM systems from the DEC - 20 and retrieving the results .
These were later to form the basis of the DEC - 20 / BITNET mail gateway .
Mar 1982 : RSTS /E retired ; RSTS users migrated to DEC - 20s , V14# 1 .
The PDP - 11/50 was traded for another badly needed RP06 disk drive for our DEC - 20s [ 1 ] .
The PDP - 11 with RSTS/E was our first experiment in campuswide public timesharing and it was an unqualified success .
Apr 1982 : BITNET announced ( Vace , V14# 5 ) .
This was a network of IBM mainframes based on RSCS ( basically , card reader / line printer simulation ) protocols , originating with Ira Fuchs at CUNY , formerly of Watson Lab , and rapidly spreading to universities all over the world , lasting through the late 1990s , now remembered mainly for LISTSERV ( a distributed automated mailing - list management system ) .
Early members included CUNY , Columbia , Yale , Brown , Princeton , the U of Maine , Penn State , the NJ Educational Network , Boston U , and Cornell University ( DIAGRAM ) .
Columbia got the CU prefix ( CUVMA , CUVMB ) , much to the chagrin of Cornell University ( CORNELLA , ...)
Would this be the first instance of domain name hijacking ? :-)
( Twenty years later , the Cornell and Columbia teaching hospitals would merge to form New York Presbyterian Hospital ; evidently " Cornell " and " Columbia " were omitted from the name so that neither one would have to follow the other . )
Apr 1982 : IBM Mainframe VM / CMS
Kermit ( Daphne Tzoar ) .
This passed through a number a hands since the initial release , some of which prefer to remain anonymous , and has been cared for by Dr. John Chandler at the Harvard / Smithsonian Astronomical Observatory since about 1990 ; John made it portable to the other important IBM mainframe OS's : MVS / TSO , CICS , and MUSIC , and added support for conversion between the many IBM EBCDIC Country Extended Code Pages and ISO standard character sets , allowing cross- platform transfer of text in many languages .
May 1982 : Support was added to our e-mail client and server software to take advantage of our new CCNET and BITNET connections , and the first inter -campus e-mail began to flow , limited at first to just a handful of universities , but growing rapidly as CCNET and BITNET nodes are added , and gateways from them to ARPANET , CSNET , and other networks .
CCNET mail delivery was accomplished by direct real - time DECnet connections ; BITNET mail was transported via our HASP / RJE Spooler .
Our three DEC - 20s used their DECnet connections for mail amongst themselves , as well as with other campus machines and the wider CCNET .
CU20A and CU20C and other campus DECnet nodes sent BITNET mail by relaying it over DECnet to CU20B 's RJE system .
In those days , e-mail addresses had to include a " top - level domain " that indicated the network , e.g. USER@HOST .
ARPA , USER@HOST .BITNET , USER@HOST.CCNET , etc .
Even trickier was the " source routing " used in Usenet ( in those days , a " network " of UNIX machines that dialed each other up with UUCP periodically to exchange files and mail ) and some others , and / or to mail to somebody who was on a network that your host was n't on , through a relay that was on both nets .
In such cases you had to know the entire route and the syntax tricks to traverse each branch of it , and often multiple relays .
Here are some examples from the 1980s Kermit mailing list archive :
MOON@SCRC@MIT-MC decwrl!rhea!vax4!arson!roberts@SU-Shasta " INFO -KERMIT@COLUMBIA-20.ARPA"@su-shasta info-kermit%columbia-20.arpa.mulga.UUCP@Berkeley decvax!mulga!nemeth.uacomsci@UCB-VAX.ARPA

( 9 - track magnetic tapes were big in these days , but every kind of computer used a different format : ANSI , DUMPER , BACKUP , MAGSAV , IBM OS SL , tar , cpio , etc , so writing tape import / export / conversion utilities was a regular cottage industry . )
( Around here , large departmental PC labs began to appear , for example in the Business School and in the Learning Center . )
1986 -1987
West German hackers use Columbia 's Kermit software to break into dozens of US military computers and capture information for the KGB , as described by Cliff Stoll in his 1989 book , The Cuckoo 's Egg [ 46 ] .
At one point , while Cliff watched on a jury - rigged T - connected terminal , the hackers were using Kermit to download a copy of the Telnet source code so they could implant a password logger , upload the result , recompile it , and install it : " Line by line , I watched Kermit shovel the program over to the hacker ...
But I could n't just kill Kermit .
He 'd notice that right away .
Now that I was closing in on him , I especially did n't want to tip my hand .
I found my key chain and reached over to the wires connected to the hacker 's line .
Jangling the keys across the connector , I shorted out his circuit for an instant .
This added just enough noise to confuse the computer , but not enough to kill the connection ...
It worked like a charm .
I 'd jangle my keys , he'd see the noise , and his computer would ask for a replay of the last line ... "
This slowed the transfer down so much that the hacker eventually lost patience and gave up -- but it did n't stop Kermit !
As long as the connection stays up , no matter how awful , Kermit pushes the file through .
Cliff also measured the delay between Kermit packet and acknowledgment to estimate the hacker 's distance from California ( 6000 miles , a fairly accurate estimate of the distance to Hannover ) .
1 Jan 1986 : CUCCA and Libraries merge .
Information is information , right ?
( V18#2 ) .
CUCCA now reports to the University Librarian , Pat Battin .
( In fact , it seems that CUCCA and Libraries merge periodically ; in some sense , CUCCA has always reported to the University Librarian ; in another sense the real merger came only later , under Elaine Sloan . )
The administrative half of CUCCA , ADP ( now AIS , Administrative Information Services ) , is severed and reports to Low Library , and eventually ( 1991 ) moves from Watson Lab to Thorndike Hall at Teachers College .
Jan 1986 : Columbia 's first networked PC lab opens in 251 Engineering Terrace , populated with the UNIX ( Pro/380 ) , MS - DOS ( Rainbow ) and VAX workstations from the Hermit grant , plus eight 512K ( " fat " ) Macintoshes and two Mac / XLs , a LaserWriter printing station , an IBM PC , and the original Kermit Superbrain ( V18#2 ) .
The Pro/380 was a workstation made by DEC with a PDP - 11 inside .
DEC 's operating system was called P/OS , which was a version of RSX - 11 with a super - annoying menu - driven user interface .
We adapted 2.8BSD UNIX to the machine for use in the lab , so these were the first public Unix workstations deployed at Columbia .
Furthermore , unlike the Rainbows , Macs , and the PC ( which communicated only through their serial ports with Kermit ) , they were on Ethernet , and therefore on the Internet .
Jan 1986 : Kermit Project founded .
Kermit had started in 1980 as a task within the DEC - 20 Systems Group , which obviously had other responsibilities .
By the mid-80s , Kermit had become popular all over the world , and we were receiving hundreds of requests for it every week from sites that were not on the network .
Meanwhile , other sites were sending in new Kermit implementations of their own .
Fulfilling these requests and maintaining the Kermit software archive ( and mailing list , etc ) had become a full - time job , so a full - time Kermit group , led by Christine Gianone ( formerly the business manager in SSIO ) , was created to manage and distribute the software and take over the online archive , the mailing lists , tech support , and so on .
The programming was still done by members of the Systems group and external volunteers .
Software distribution charges were instituted to cover costs .
The old raised - floor machine room in the back of the 7th floor of Watson Lab ( added in 1959 for the IBM 1620 ) became the Kermit room , containing the Kermit Project computers and media production equipment .
May 1986 : The height of CCNET , which now includes Columbia , CMU , CWRU , NYU , Stevens , Vassar , and Oberlin ( V18#5 ) .
An October 1986 listing shows about 200 " nodes " on the network with DEC operating systems including TOPS - 10 , TOPS - 20 , VMS , Ultrix , RSX - 11 / M , and P / OS .
Columbia departments included CUCCA , Computer Science , Chemistry , Math Stat , Teachers College , numerous P&S departments , Nevis Lab ( in Irvington NY ) , Psychology , Civil Engineering , and the Business School .
Other universities ( mainly in Ohio ) would join later , but in a few more years the Internet would make CCNET obsolete .
May 1986 : First public description of Columbia 's Ethernet backbone network , and enunciation of policy for departmental connections to it ( V18# 5 ) , which was accomplished by us writing a letter for the Provost to sign .
Jul 1986 : First issue of Kermit News .
16 Jul 1986 : Columbia University as a whole ( as opposed to only the Computer Science Department ) receives approval from the Defense Projects Research Agency to join the ARPANET ( which would soon become the Internet ) [ SEE LETTER ] .
Aug 1986 : Mathematics joins Ethernet backbone .
1986 : ( month ? ) Richard Sacks takes over as acting CUCCA Director .
( Howard leaves somewhere in here ... )
Sep 1986 : The Scholarly Information Center ( SIC ) is proclaimed by Pat Battin , University Librarian .
Sep 1986 : More about the campus backbone : " A bright yellow half - inch coaxial cable runs through the steam tunnels up and across the west and north edges of the Morningside campus .
This cable is the campus Ethernet backbone , a large part of which was installed as part of an external research grant from Digital Equipment Corporation [ the Hermit Project ] . "
( Alan Crosswell , Networks at Columbia , SIC Journal V1# 1 , Sep 1986 ) .
The backbone ran from Watson Lab to Mathematics to Chemistry to the Computer Center to Computer Science to Mudd ( DIAGRAM ) .
At the time coax - based IBM PCNET and Token Ring PC networks were commonplace networking methods for PCs .
Oct 1986 : Kermit , A File Transfer Protocol ( Frank ) published by Digital Press , with a Foreword by Donald Knuth .
It remained in print for 14 years .
Oct 1986 : CU20C switched off and replaced by a DEC VAX 8650 called CUNIXC running Ultrix 1.1 , DEC 's brand of UNIX , a 4.2BSD derivative .
A pilot project assigned some CS courses to CUNIXC in Fall 1986 .
This was our first step in phasing out the DEC - 20s after the line was discontinued by DEC in 1983 .
This stung so severely that we would never run a proprietary operating system again ( except on the IBM mainframes , of course ) .
The attraction of UNIX was that it was available -- with relatively minor variations -- on all kinds of computers , great and small .
The 8650 was approximately equal to the DEC - 20 in size , weight , and cost ; it was chosen because we could recycle many of the DEC - 20 peripherals , and because ( unlike other UNIXes ) it supported DECnet , which we still used for departmental connections .
Lots more HERE about the conversion from TOPS - 20 to Unix .
( About UNIX ...
There is much that appeals about UNIX .
Its well - known original attributes ( simplicity , terseness , consistent building - block tools ) were spelled out in the seminal BSTJ issue [ 15 ] .
In addition , it is platform independent , so sites like ours are not tied to a particular vendor .
Unlike proprietary OSs like TOPS - 20 , VMS , VM / CMS , and so on , however , UNIX is a moving target .
Ever since control of UNIX left Bell Labs , every implementation ( Ultrix , OSF / 1 , AIX , HP - UX , SunOS , Solaris , IRIX , Linux , FreeBSD , etc etc ) is different in sometimes subtle but always aggravating ways , and ( with a few notable exceptions such as OpenBSD ) every new release of every varation tends to break existing applications ( whereas programs written for TOPS - 20 , VMS , MVS / TSO , or VM / CMS decades ago still work , without even recompiling ) .
Any program more complicated than " hello world " is rarely portable from one UNIX to another without some " porting " work at the source - code level .
To compound matters , documentation is increasingly scant .
In the 1970s and 80s , every operating system ( even UNIX ) came with a " wall " of printed manuals that documented everything in excruciating detail .
But now documentation is considered a waste of time and effort , since everything will change anyway .
In modern UNIX , the only reliable documentation is the source code , and even that decays over time . )

Jan 1990 : Using MS - DOS Kermit ( Christine ) published by Digital Press , with a jacket blurb by Cliff Stoll ( Yow ! ) , author of The Cuckoo 's Egg [ 46 ] .
A second edition was published in 1992 .
German and French translations were also published , as was another book about MS - DOS Kermit in Japanese ( see the Kermit Bibliography ) .
May 1990 : Vace Kundakci takes over as Director , renames CUCCA to AcIS ( Academic Information Systems ) , as distinct from AIS ( Administrative Information Services , formerly ADP ) .
Mid-1990 : Alan Crosswell becomes Systems Manager , responsible for all central academic computing systems ( IBM and other ) , a post last held by Howard Eskin and vacated 5 years before .
By this time the only central computers that matter are Unix - based ( DEC , then Encore , then Sun , plus workstations from Sun , NeXT , and HP ) — the academic IBM mainframe is used mainly by the Libraries and a handful of external paying users .
( Somewhere around here CCNET was disbanded because of the Internet . )
Jan 1991 : The Senior Vice President of Columbia is bitten by the outsourcing bug and brings in a consulting firm , American Management Systems Inc ( AMS ) , to take over and " clean out " administrative computing ( AIS ) .
Seventeen people are fired .
Although a couple of service improvements resulted ( mainly a new Student Information System , SIS ) , many millions of dollars were wasted on " cutting edge " projects that never panned out and a number of talented people were lost .
Eventually AMS left the scene and equilibrium was restored .
1991 : We buy a truckload of NeXT UNIX ( NeXTSTEP ) workstations for both staff and labs ( photo ) ; a major commitment , and ( I believe ) an attempt to stem the tide of PCs and Macs , which were intrinsically unsafe and labor intensive for their users and owners ( the PCs more so than Macs , which have always had a great deal of support from a large contingent of the technical staff ) and for AcIS staff in its role of support - giver .
The NeXTs were configured and managed centrally ; user logins were via network to the central University database ; user directories were on centrally located , managed , and backed up NFS - mounted disks .
But before long NeXT was out of business .
1991 : There is much expansion , renovation , and upgrading of public computer labs during 1991 ( and ever since ) .
The academic and administrative IBM mainframes ( 4381 , 3090 , and 3083 ) are all replaced by a single IBM ES / 9121 , which is partitioned into separate academic and administrative virtual machines ( a feature of IBM's VM operating system ) .
Jan 1991 : Three Sun-4/280s ( full - sized cabinets ) are installed in the machine room as CUNIXA , CUNIXB , and CUNIXD running SunOS 4.1 .
These ( and the Encore ) were soon replaced by Sun pizza - box sized servers , and SunOS was replaced by Solaris .
Where central computers once weighed tons , cost millions , filled acres of floor space , required massive cooling and exotic forms of power , now they 're dirt - cheap commodity items running at unheard - of speeds with seemingly limitless amounts of memory and storage , that can be carried under your arm and plugged into an ordinary wall socket at ambient room temperature .
Of course , today 's applications and data saturate this vast capacity just as effectively as yesterday 's simpler applications overwhelmed the resources available then , and so it shall always be .
Mar - Oct 1991 : Kermit protocol for conversion of Japanese text among diverse encodings , and for efficient transfer of predominantly 8 - bit text encodings over 7 - bit transports .
( Around here , disk service begins to shift from locally attached disks to RAID file servers , and the backup system changes from the traditional manual 9 - track tape operation to automated network backups to a DAT - drive " juke box " .
All the software was locally written and included all the academic servers , Sun as well as the IBM mainframe .
Later a commercial backup system , Veritas , took the place of the original homegrown one .
Capacity as of Jan 2001 : 400 x 40 GB tapes = 16000 GB ( 16TB ) to cover 1.7TB usable space on the academic file servers . )
Jan 1992 : Conversion of Morningside campus backbone from Ethernet coax to optical fiber begins ; cutover in Spring 1992 .
Apr 1992 : AIS moves out of Watson Lab to new quarters in Thorndike Hall at Teachers College ( MAP ) and in the Computer Center Building [ 20 ] .
Floors 1 through 5 of Watson Lab were left vacant for a period , and then , even though the AcIS space on floors 6 - 9 was ( and remains ) severely and increasingly overcrowded , the lower five floors — with their rich history and key role in science and computing — were converted to art studios .
Nov 1992 : Using C- Kermit ( Frank and Christine ) published by Digital Press , concurrent with the release of version 5 of C - Kermit .
A second edition would follow in 1997 , as well as a German translation .
1992-1993 : Columbia 's Kermit software handles the communications in the British relief mission to Bosnia .
1993 : The era of the search engine begins .
First there was Archie , then Hypertelnet , then Gopher , then the Web .
In 1993 , ColumbiaNet is hot , a million accesses per year ( a figure soon to be dwarfed by the Web , see Web statistics table ) .
ColumbiaNet is a text - based menu - driven service ( remember text ? ) .
Here 's the main menu , preserved for posterity :

Epilog
The first paragraph below was written a long time ago and does n't really apply more .
In the new century , computing resources are mainly private and the University happily supplies the mostly invisible infrastructure .
There are no more budget battles as in the 1970s and 80s , nowadays nobody questions the importance of universal high - speed network availability and when the network needs expanding or upgrading , it happens without a struggle .
Furthermore support staff is at an all - time high , by far , as is office space .
But then , so is tuition , yet students get a lot less bang for the buck in terms of employment prospects after graduation , not to mention many of them being saddled with enormous debt .
Sometimes I wonder if students 100 or 250 years ago did n't get a better education with just lectures , blackboards , and books .
A theme that runs throughout this story is the neverending tug - of - war between supply and demand .
Computers were extremely expensive in the early days , and space has always been the most valuable resource at Columbia 's confined urban campus .
The first computers were obtained largely through grants for specific research projects , but soon other uses were found for them and the University became increasingly dependent on them .
After the grants expired the computers had to be continuously maintained , upgraded , and replaced .
The eternal questions have been : How to pay ?
What to sacrifice ?
Where to put the equipment ?
How to get the space ?
How to recoup the expense ?
How to increase access ?
How to allocate limited computing resources ?
How to expand resources that are swamped by increasing demand ?
Who subidizes and who is subsidized ?
It 's interesting to ponder the transformation of Columbia from a quill - pen operation in the 1700s to the " wired " ( and , increasingly , wireless ) one it is today .
Computers , obtained originally for scientific work that could not be done any other way , were also turned to administrative tasks such as registration , student records , payroll , and so on .
What was the cost in money , space , and personnel before and after ?
And then later when centralized computing ( based on a single multimillion dollar computer system ) became fully distributed , with a PC on every desk , how did that change the overall expenditures , consumption of space and electrical power , personnel rosters , and the productivity of each person ?
Any clear answer would take a great deal more research than was done here , but the following table is suggestive :
1925 2010 Increase Students 24188 27606 14 % Officers of Instruction 1771 3630 205 % Officers of Administration 92 5813 6218 % Full - Time Support Staff 1198 3402 184 % Tuition ( dollars per point ) 8 1372 17150 % Sources :
The 1925 figures come from Columbia 's 1924 - 25 Catalog [ 5 ] and from the 1924 - 25 Annual Report [ 35 ] ; the student count does not include another 12,916 summer session students ; the officers of administration include 38 who are also on the faculty .
The 2010 figures come from the Columbia University Statistical Abstract of the Office of Planning and Institutional Research ( on the Web ) .
The growth in faculty is accounted for almost entirely by the Health Sciences campus , which did not exist in 1925 .
Although the role of computing in staff and tuition increases is far from clear , it is evident that Columbia University was able to offer a first - class education to about 20,000 students annually with a lot less overhead and at far less expense without computers than with them , even accounting for inflation ( which averaged 3.1 % per year from 1925 to 2000 or 987 % over the period ; thus if tuition had merely kept pace with inflation , it would have risen only to $ 79 per point rather than $ 834 in 2000 ) .
Of course , one can't necessarily blame computers alone for a topheavy bureaucracy -- since the 1950s , huge amounts of additional work in the form of reports ( compliance , demographic , financial , etc ) mandated by government , suppliers , and contractors at every level .
Anyway , as any student who registered in the old days ( filling in countless forms by hand with the same information and standing in about 50 lines to turn in each form ) can tell you , some of the new systems are an improvement .
Columbia is also a far bigger employer than it was in 1925 and it's a good thing that more people have work , even if it 's pointless .
Or if you take a closer look , maybe it 's not such a good thing .
When the Computer Center opened in 1963 , there was one big computer for everybody to use , cared for by a small professional staff , initially just 15 people .
Today , the combined full - time staff of AcIS and AIS ( now CUIT ) numbers well into the hundreds , and this does n't count an unknown number of full and part - time computer people in the administrative and academic departments , nor junior faculty and graduate students shanghaied into system - administration roles , nor the fact that almost everybody at the University devotes copious time to " managing " and fighting with their own desktop computers into the bargain , not to mention dealing ( or worse : not ) with the constant onslaught of viruses , worms , and hacks from all corners of the world .
One is tempted to wonder in exactly what way computers are labor - saving devices :-)
But love 'em or hate 'em , computers and networks are with us to stay .
They first came to Columbia for scientific and statistical work ; now they are used mainly for social and entertainment purposes , plus taking notes in class , preparation of papers , a certain amount of course work , and for carrying on the business of the University , including a great deal of public relations .
All students and faculty are presumed to have computer , network , and Web access ; it is required in many courses and for numerous tasks such as looking up class schedules , room assignments , and grades , and since Fall 2001 , also for registration .
The benefits of the Web are well known but its dangers little discussed , at least not beyond the well - known safety hazards ( credit - card theft , pedophiles , viruses ) and annoyances ( bugs and new features requiring constant software upgrades ) .
Let 's look at some of the more fundamental pitfalls that tend to be ignored as we rush to replace all that is old by what is new :
For good or ill , the Web has largely replaced the Library for undergraduate research .
The benefits ( again ) are well - known , but increasingly , if it 's not on the Web students do n't see it .
Furthermore , it 's often difficult to assess the information one finds on the Web .
Published books and journal articles , at least , have some measure of quality control and some form of audit trail ( you can check the primary sources yourself ) .
At the very least , they are substantial and immutable objects that can be referenced -- when you look at a book or article that I have referenced , you see the same one I saw .
Web pages are ephemeral , likely to move , change , or disappear at any moment , and in any case rarely have the authority of a refereed , printed publication .
Since I wrote the previous item , the Web itself has been largely supplanted by Google and Wikipedia for research .
Wikipedia is handy , to be sure , but how do you verify the accuracy of anything in it ?
Google , on the other hand , is a massive corporation whose only goal is making more and more money , and as part of achieving that goal , it controls the content we see .
Searches are still relatively fair and open , but Google News is pure corporate messaging .
Nevertheless , Google can throw a switch at any moment to hide entire bodies of knowledge or opinion it deems prejudicial to its corporate health .
In a new application of Gresham 's Law , the Web tends to drive out reliable and detailed information , replacing it with unreliable and sketchy " sound bites " .
Libraries full of books and journals are increasingly viewed as " legacy " " brick and mortar " operations that can no longer justify their existence in the age of electronic information .
But those same libraries contain all that is known of history , culture , and science .
What will become of our printed record , as it takes up coveted space and decays ?
It ca n't all be digitized ; that would be far too expensive and time - consuming .
Therefore much -- probably most -- of it will be lost to posterity .
And then whatever portion was digitized before the paper was discarded or crumbled will itself be subject to successive rounds of winnowing as the digital media , encoding , and formats become obsolete and require " upgrading " .
US Politics US Must Recover from Delusional Politics Will Americans learn to trust their fellow citizens or stay stuck on stupidly backing serial political betrayers ?
By Joel S. Hirschhorn
Published February 09 , 2007
Our constitutional democracy makes it nearly impossible to free the nation from the grip of a seemingly sane but deeply delusional president .
The present constitutional provision for impeachment is clearly inadequate .
As with other delusional tyrants , US President George W. Bush has surrounded himself with sycophants who share his delusions , and perhaps nurtured them , and refuse to tell the emperor that he has no clothes .
Congress , even under Democratic control , commits negligent cowardice ; and our mainstream press has not rallied the nation to free itself from misused presidential power .
Also clear to some of us is that the delusional Bush has survived because delusion runs rampant across the nation , blocking populist actions in the national interest .
States of Delusion
Here are the main states of American delusion :
Millions of Americans persist in believing , contrary to all historical evidence , that changing control of Congress and the Executive Branch between Democrats and Republicans produces sorely needed reforms .
Mainstream politicians are serial betrayers ; thus , people suffer from delusional political faith .
Millions of non-wealthy Americans believe that the economy works for them .
This persists despite reams of facts that show how working - and middle - class people are not receiving their fair share of national income and wealth .
They keep running on a debt treadmill that will not take them to the proverbial American dream .
What they get is economic insecurity , inequality and injustice .
Consumer confidence is an oxymoron .
This is delusional prosperity .
Viral delusional thinking is that America sets the gold standard for democracies .
To its credit , the rest of the world sees an arrogant nation with a government that uses its military strength foolishly and sees its policies rewarding the rich at the expense of all others .
People from Finland to New Zealand question why Americans do not receive universal health care , why its workers are sacrificed for global trade and corporate powers , why millions of its citizens go hungry and homeless , why so few people bother to vote , why so many politicians are convicted of crimes , and why there are more people in prisons than in all other countries combined .
Yet Americans , by and large , keep thinking that their constitutional republic gives them first class democracy .
This is delusional patriotism .
Escape from Delusion
So , what are we to do ?
Keep expressing dissent by marching and protesting in the streets ?
Keep signing petitions on the Internet ?
Keep demanding impeachment of Bush ?
Keep reading and writing angry diatribes on progressive websites ?
Keep voting for mainstream politicians from the two major parties , hoping for a political messiah ?
Keep obeying Bush by borrowing , spending , shopping and consuming to keep our debt - ridden nation afloat ?
Such activities release anger , but are largely placebo self - medications , unlikely to provide the permanent solutions our nation needs .
Protests serve more as entertainment for the nation than a force to tear down the rotten system .
Scale is a problem .
Maybe if one million angry Americans sat down peacefully in the streets all around the White House , defying police action for many days , just maybe the system would crack .
Protests must have a revolutionary character .
They must induce fear into the hearts of smug and delusional power elites - like Dick Cheney .
Structural Reform
The real needs are structural reforms that combat the major societal delusions that are driving America downhill .
We must attack the root causes of problems rather than provide temporary relief or cover - up of symptoms .
Delusional political faith and delusional prosperity require profound reforms in our political system .
A new competitive political party is needed , one that is guided by a set of principles that both mainstream Democrats and Republicans can not opportunistically accept , because the principles clearly conflict with their rotten behavior .
A recent New America Foundation survey of Californians found that " seven in ten voters say they often feel they must choose the lesser of two evils ; more than half the voters say California needs another major political party . "
Fixing Delusional Patriotism
Delusional patriotism is tougher to remedy .
To revitalize American democracy we must have a national dialogue .
Heed the words of the great John Marshall : " The people made the constitution , and the people can unmake it .
It is the creature of their will , and lives only by their will . "
Here 's James Madison : " the people have an indubitable , unalienable , and indefeasible right to reform or change their Government , whenever it be found adverse or inadequate to the purposes of its institution . "
Thomas Jefferson believed that the constitution - drafting process should be repeated by each generation of Americans .
That 's what real freedom is all about .
A great democracy must be much more than stable - it must be self - correcting .
Citizens Must Trust Themselves
When a political system no longer deserves trust , citizens must trust themselves .
Considering how doggedly our un-representative democracy stays under the grip of moneyed special interests and fails large fractions of Americans , more direct democracy aimed squarely at major reforms is desperately needed .
That requires a lot more than protesting and ranting .
Some urge citizens ' assemblies ( see www.cusdi.org/ and www.healthydemocracy.org/), or national initiative elections ( see votep2.us / ) .
I and others believe that we have a constitutional right to Article V Conventions ( see www.foavc.org).
However , elitist status quo forces have made the population afraid of such activities - a sick , delusional , status quo bias belief .
If it persists , Americans will not set themselves free of the oppressive forces that have hijacked their nation .
They will keep venting their anger as dissenters or stay distractive consumers rather than work to return power to the people .
Let 's not delude ourselves that all will be well after Bush is gone .
As awful as Bush is , he is only a symptom of what ails our nation .
Our nation will remain in need of deep reforms .
Millions of dissidents must wake up to what is really needed and rally around a revolutionary strategy .

Two weeks ago today , inside the million - dollar - plus houses on a quiet cul - de-sac in Encino , the neighborhood kids delighted in what the Easter Bunny had brought .
Then , about 10 a.m. , the porn stars started showing up .
For the record : For The Record
Los Angeles Times Wednesday May 03 , 2006 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 2 National Desk 1 inches ; 66 words Type of Material : Correction
Adult movie locations :
An article Sunday in Section A about the filming of adult movies in Los Angeles referred to Film L.A. as a city agency .
In fact , Film L.A. Inc. is a private , nonprofit corporation that issues film permits on behalf of the city as well as other jurisdictions , such as Los Angeles County , the Los Angeles Unified School District and the Angeles National Forest .
Helaine Gesas , who has lived on Hayvenhurst Avenue for 38 years , was in her kitchen cooking Passover supper when she noticed men hauling cameras and lights into the two - story house across the street .
Her neighbor Kerry Cohen , a paralegal and mother , was on her way out to organize a charity event .
As she squeezed past several large production trucks , Cohen looked in her rear - view mirror and saw “ scantily clad ” young women parking their cars and heading toward the same house .

As far as John R. Johnson was concerned , “ that was the end of Easter Sunday . ”
Johnson , another neighbor , told his 9 - year - old daughter to stay inside while what he described as a “ prison - yard break ” -- a large film crew , many of its members covered in tattoos -- entered the iron gates of the house in the 3600 block of Hayvenhurst .
Outraged , Johnson called the city seeking to shut the porn shoot down .
But everything , he was told , was perfectly legal .
In any given year , about 3,900 adult films are shot in Los Angeles , according to industry estimates .
As with any other shoot , those films are supposed to obtain permits from the city .
But the city does n’t restrict the content of the projects it approves .
Which means that if one of your neighbors decides , as Johnson ’s did , to rent out his house for the filming of “ The Alphabet ” -- in which sexual acts are performed in alphabetical order by 21 - year - old identical twins -- there ’s not much you can do to stop him .

Many in L.A. have endured film shoots in their neighborhoods and know the infuriation of traffic congestion and sidewalks swarming with self - important production crews .
But along with the hassle often comes a little cachet -- if you lived in a dump , chances are they would n’t be shooting a romantic comedy or luxury - car commercial next door .
When the call sheet calls for neither witty patter nor rich Corinthian leather but instead for orgiastic sex , cachet is n’t what the neighbors talk about .
Morality , their children ’s physical safety , property values -- those are the topics on many people ’s minds .
The tale of the Hayvenhurst cul - de-sac , where several adult productions have been shooting almost nonstop for two weeks ( and were booked to continue through Monday ) , pulls back the curtain on how one of the region ’s most thriving industries -- pornography -- coexists with the city itself .
Sure , the neighbors concede , they did n’t actually see any nudity or obscene activity , but the mere idea that it was going on next door bothered them .

A week before Easter Sunday , neighborhood residents received a flier notifying them that there would be filming down the street in the coming days .
Johnson , who works at home as an advertising consultant , said he did n’t think much of it .
But soon after the crews started arriving two weeks ago , Johnson ’s wife called the number on the flier to find out more about the company in their midst .
She was told it was Califa Productions , which shoots films for Vivid Entertainment Group , one of the world ’s largest purveyors of hard - core porn .
The next day , after Johnson barraged city officials with e-mails and phone calls , he was told the production was legal : Califa had been issued the proper permit .

“ As far as content , we do n’t have any authority to go in and do anything unless there ’s an impact on the neighborhood , ” said Steve MacDonald , president of Film L.A. , the city agency that authorized almost 55,000 individual days of shooting in 2005 -- with fewer than 3,000 of those , he said , devoted to porn .
( City officials believe many adult films do n’t obtain the required permits . )
MacDonald and his staff said that because of the free - speech provision of the 1st Amendment , they do not discriminate against adult film producers as long as they abide by the conditions of their permit .
Permits for adult films are the same as for any other shoot in terms of parking and street activity , but different in that interiors and exteriors must not be audible or visible to the public .
The Hayvenhurst residents say they ’re all for creative freedom .
But to all but the ones who were getting paid $ 1,750 a day by Califa Productions , what was happening on their street at holiday time just did n’t seem right .

“ I was stunned that whoever issues permits for this would be that insensitive , ” Johnson said .
“ If they had been shooting a ‘ West Wing ’ episode that day , I would n’t have had the same reaction . ”
As it turned out , Easter was just the beginning .
Not 24 hours after the Califa trucks drove off , a new crew arrived .
This time it was Playboy Entertainment Group , working on a reality television show .
The Playboy shoot went through the end of the week , with dozens of trucks entering and exiting the cul - de-sac .
Last Monday yet another company arrived , PW Productions -- this time to shoot explicit DVD and video cover art for a series of adult films .

Residents circulated a petition that alleged the filming has “ introduced unsavory and undesirable elements ” into their “ otherwise peaceful neighborhood . ”
Twenty - two residents signed .
Where had the neighborhood gone , they wondered ?
And who were the neighbors who seemed determined to erode it ?
“ They do n’t wave , they want nothing to do with anyone else , ” said Cohen , the paralegal .
“ Why should we be put out just because they want to make money ? ”
Regulations require certification of ownership in order to rent out a home as a film location .
According to property records , the house -- a 15 - year - old , four - bedroom , five - bath , 5,000 - square - foot , stone - and - brick traditional -- sold last year for $ 1.65 million to Hamid Banafsheha .
Advertisement
When reached by phone last week , Banafsheha -- a 40 - year - old electric supply warehouse owner -- said he had just found out about the filming from neighbors .
Banafsheha said he had rented the home to a couple with two infant daughters .
“ I ’m sorry for all the neighbors , ” he said , adding that he had told his tenants to cease and desist .
Because he plans to put the home up for sale in a month , he said , “ I do n’t want the property value to come down -- I mean , it ’s real estate here . ”
A woman who answered the phone at the film site last week and identified herself as tenant Odelia Bustenay did offer a response to the neighbors ’ concerns before abruptly hanging up .
“ Everything we do here is legal , ” she said .
“ We got permits for everything .
If they are upset then they are nosy . ”

There ’s a joke in the porn industry about the nosiness the business seems to inspire .
It goes like this :
An old lady calls the police after she finds out a porn film is being shot next door .
When the officer arrives , he peers through the window but ca n’t see anything .
“ You have to go upstairs , ” she says , leading him to a second - floor bathroom .
Still , he sees nothing .
“ No , ” she said , “ you have to stand on the toilet . ”
Steven Hirsch , the co-founder of Vivid , which distributes 60 films a year , said he knows that adult productions make some people uneasy .
He said that only makes Vivid crews more careful .

“ We are cognizant that the neighbors are around when we shoot , ” he said .
“ We are quiet , and we do n’t bring a lot of equipment .
There are n’t people running around naked , and you ca n’t look through the fence in the backyard and see what we are doing . ”
Hirsch added that the reason this particular house has attracted so many productions is that it ’s awfully cheap .
Many houses charge upward of $ 5,000 per day , or almost three times what Banafsheha ’s tenants were getting .
Brooke , 22 , a tall , skinny blond who said she got rid of her last name long ago , costarred alongside the twins -- Lacey and Lyndsey Love -- in Vivid ’s “ The Alphabet ” and does n’t understand why residents got so worked up .
“ I ’m a human being , and I do n’t see what the big deal is , ” she said .
Advertisement
“ The person in the next house should get a life , because we ’re shooting inside and it does n’t harm them .
It was just a normal day .
I did what I had to do and went home and had dinner with my family . ”
Meanwhile , Film L.A. staffers said that in the wake of the petition , they have flagged the home as overused , with too many productions being done there in too short a time .
They do not plan to issue any more permits for the time being .
Larry Flynt Productions , which was due to shoot at the house Monday , has canceled .
The neighborhood opposition , the company told the city , had ruined the mood .
WASHINGTON --
The former leader of the Justice Department team that prosecuted a landmark lawsuit against tobacco companies said yesterday that Bush administration political appointees repeatedly ordered her to take steps that weakened the government 's racketeering case .
Sharon Eubanks said President Bush 's loyalists in Attorney General Alberto Gonzales ' s office began micromanaging the team 's strategy in the final weeks of the 2005 trial , to the detriment of the government 's claim that the industry had conspired to lie to US smokers .
She said a supervisor demanded that she and her trial team drop arguments that tobacco executives be removed from their corporate positions as a possible penalty .
He and two others instructed her to tell key witnesses to change their testimony .
And they ordered Eubanks to read verbatim from a closing argument they rewrote for her , she said .
" The political people were pushing the buttons and ordering us to say what we said , " Eubanks said .
" And because of that , we failed to zealously represent the interests of the American public . "
Eubanks , who was a lawyer at Justice for 22 years , said three political appointees were responsible for the late shifts in the government 's tobacco case in June 2005 : then - associate attorney general Robert McCallum , then - assistant attorney general Peter Keisler , and his deputy , Dan Meron .
News reports on the strategy changes at the time caused an uproar in Congress and sparked an inquiry by the Justice Department .
Eubanks , who left the department in 2005 , said she is coming forward now because she is concerned about what she called the " overwhelming politicization " of the department demonstrated by the controversy over the firing of eight US attorneys .

Sweden is considered to be a safe haven for Pirates , and received a special mention in the piracy report that was published this week by the International Intellectual Property Alliance ( IIPA ) .
The IIPA report highlights the political debate following the raid on Sweden ’s popular BitTorrent tracker The Pirate Bay .
The copyright industry is said to be deeply concerned that the Social Democratic party and the Moderate party during the fall have made positive remarks on the idea of a fee on broadband as an alternative to keeping piracy illegal .
The raid on the Pirate Bay , and the rise of the Pirate Party clearly left their mark on Sweden ’s political climate .
The extremely fast resurrection of the Pirate Bay was a slap in the face of the IIPA , MPAA , and other anti-piracy organizations .
In the report we read :
Sweden also is the host country to ThePirateBay.org , the world ’s largest BitTorrent tracker and one of Sweden ’s largest web sites .
Operators of the site proudly flaunt their role in facilitating infringements , often taking pot shots at rights holders from whom they receive notices of infringing activity .
The PirateBay was raided in mid-2006 by the Swedish police , and although the site is back up and running , it is expected that its prosecution will take place in the middle of 2007
The IIPA can not yet see an end to the widespread piracy in Sweden .
According to the organization , 490 000 movies were downloaded during the third quarter last year , an increase from 468 000 movies the year before , the report says , not specifying any source .
The situation is further complicated , according to the organization , by the fact that Swedes are tolerant towards piracy , something that according to the report is evident in media and in public opinion .
The politicians are not thought of as having understood the extent of the file sharing problem .
The organization however claims to be looking forward to cooperating with the new government in finding new ways in the struggle against piracy .
Traditionally , researchers have looked for clues to an infection by tracking down the virus or bacteria causing it .
But that does n't always work because the bacteria or virus may not be present in the blood or other easily accessible area .
Researchers at UT Southwestern , Children 's Medical Center Dallas and Baylor Institute for Immunology Research came up with a different approach - analyzing the telltale " fingerprints " a disease leaves behind on cells involved in the immune response , and using that information to get a composite sketch of the infectious agent .
" We are genetically programmed to respond differently to different infections .
We have developed the tools to understand that , " said Dr. Octavio Ramilo , professor of pediatrics at UT Southwestern and lead author of a study appearing in the March edition of the journal Blood .
" Infectious diseases are the No.1 cause of death in the world .
So we hope this eventually can be used not only to diagnose , but also to understand the prognosis and how the body is responding to therapy , " he said .
Different viruses and bacteria trigger the activation of very specific genes that code for proteins called receptors in leukocytes , the white blood cells th at help the body fight infections .
Researchers surmised that if they looked at the leukocytes , they could detect the specific pattern of receptors - similar to a disease " fingerprint " - and be able to identify which infection was present .
The process to identify such biosignatures is called gene expression profiling , and it 's done using microarray analysis .
Researchers extracted genetic material called RNA from a drop of blood and placed it on a special gene chip called a microarray , which contains probes for the whole human genome and measures which genes are turned on or off .
In this study , researchers analyzed gene expression patterns in leukocytes from 29 children at Children 's known to have one of four common infections : flu ( influenza A ) ; staph ( Staphylococcus aureus ) ; strep ( Streptococcus pneumoniae ) ; or E. coli ( Escherichia coli ) .
They analyzed 35 genes that help distinguish infections and identified infectious agents with better - than - average success rates .
Doctors were able to distinguish between the influenza , E. coli and strep infections in 95 percent of cases .
A different set of genes distinguished E. coli from staph infections with 85 percent accuracy .
Further investigation demonstrated clear distinction between viral and bacterial pneumonias .
The next step will be to study whether the microarray analysis can be applied in a more challenging clinical setting , such as an emergency room .
" When a child comes in with a fever to the ER , we want to see if we can predict who just has a virus and can go home , and who has to be admitted and put into the intensive care unit and treated with antibiotics .
That 's our goal , " said Dr. Ramilo .
" This is just the first step .
But it establishes a basis for us to do that . "
While pediatricians could n't perform the analysis in their offices , researchers are already thinking about a possible way they could send in the results from the chip and get the analysis back via the Internet , for example .
" Pediatricians understand that this could change the way we do things , " said Dr. Ramilo , who leads pediatric infectious disease research at UT Southwestern and Children's .
It could also prove useful for identifying previously unknown illnesses or biological weapons .
" Even if we do n't know which pathogen it is , we still can tell which family or which group it's in , so if someone engineers a virus that has never been seen , we will have hints that it 's close to something that is known , " he said .
Further studies may eventually help doctors track the progression of disease and help assess risks of complications , Dr. Ramilo said .

The Daily Show demystifies Bush 's war ' czar ' job David Edwards and Mike Sheehan
Published : Friday April 13 , 2007 Print This Email This On Thursday 's Daily Show , Jon Stewart took aim at President Bush 's " airing of the platitudes . "
" It matters what happens in distant lands , " President Bush is shown saying in an address .
Stewart remarks , " Of course that seems obvious to many people , but he just found that out . "
Stewart also tries demystifying Bush 's search for a war czar .
" So there you have it , folks : five years into the global war on terror , the President believes it is now time for someone to be in charge of it . "
As the Washington Post recently reported , " The White House wants to appoint a high - powered czar to oversee the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan with authority to issue directions to the Pentagon , the State Department and other agencies , but it has had trouble finding anyone able and willing to take the job , according to people close to the situation . "
The paper reported that at least three retired generals approched by the administration have taken themselves out of consideration for the position , according to sources .
The cold shoulders underscore the White House 's " difficulty in enlisting its top recruits to join the team after five years of warfare that have taxed the United States and its military . "
This is a wonderful biomedical animation , which seems was created to explain physiology and disease processes to patients and to health professionals .
Thanks to Al Fin for finding this animation .
I wonder if in future we can have the HealthTube equivalent of YouTube , where one can watch thousands of animations such as this to understand how biological systems work .
I have been spending a lot of time thinking about leveraging Erlang 's concurrency features and OTP in web applications .
Right now I do n't believe that any of the available frameworks do that very well .
Erlyweb tries to be ' rails ' for Erlang without really leveraging the features that make Erlang great .
Yaws is more a web server then a web app server .
It tries to make some amends here by providing things like appmods and yapps but they feel bolted on and they do n't really leverage OTP at all .
This has been an open issue in my mind for some time .
I created the tercio project as a starting point to solve this problem back in November or December of last year .
It languished for awhile , partly because I had yet to figure out a elegant solution .
Well , I think that I finally have .
Its the logical conclusion of current web development trends .
I am surprised that no one has thought of it yet .
The idea is two fold .
1 ) Let client side handle the client side2 )
Let the server side handle the server side
The general idea is that you will let the client side handle all client side rendering .
The only server side participation in this is serving up files .
In turn , the server will handle all server side ( business ) logic .
The two should really have very little knowledge of one another .
Hmm , seems a bit too simplistic does n't it ?
I thought so , before I realized that the client side in this continuum already has a perfectly good language on which to base things .
That languages isjavascript .
I can hear the groans of dismay already .
I emitted those very same groans back in the late '90s through the mid '00s and I would n't have even considered this two years ago .
However , the landscape has changed alot in two short years .
Ajax has gained prominence , libraries like prototype have been created .
Its just a whole different world .
We are already in good shape for the server side with OTP .
So what are the mechanics of making this happen .
First we need to get away from generating html on the server side .
To do that we need to make it easy to generate it on the client side .
Manually creating dom objects really is n't the right way to go .
I think we can do this with a library called JavascriptTemplates .
This provides a reasonable templating language on top of javascript .
Since each snippet of template will be small this should provide a reasonable efficient way to go .
The second problem is how do we remove the client side knowledge from the server ?
I think tercio already does a good job here .
It provides a javascripterlang bridge .
With this javascript can send and receive messages to processes that have registered interest in client side message no the backend .
Its webserver agnostic , so by providing a small shim you can make it work with any webserver you want .
I am building a small startup on top of this framework .
I am quite sure there will be a lot of issues to work out .
However , I think the fundamental principles are solid and should provide for the right web development experience in Erlang .
Tercio is n't yet ready for prime time or even late night yet .
It should be soon though so keep your eyes posted here .
I think this deserves its own post before it gets buried in the comments .
doorman asserted that
A. CO2 levels have increased from 280-380 ppm
B. Human industrial activity only accounts for a very small percentage of total worldwide CO2 emissions .
Point A is true , of course .
A very simple calculation and a little googling though shows that the human contribution to the CO2 in the atmosphere is everything but small .
What we need :
the weight of the atmosphere on the surface .
This is 10.2 tons per square metre .
This is the same as the atmospheric pressure .
the surface area of the earth : 510,065,600 km² = 5.100656e+14 m²
the concentration of CO2 by weight : 0.0582 % ( current value ) .
The concentration per volume is 0.038 % ( =380 ppm ) , but CO2 is a bit heavier than air .
First we calculate the total mass of the atmosphere .
This is just the surface area multiplied with the weight of the atmosphere : 5.100656e+14 m² * 1.02e+4 kg/m² = 5.202669e+18 kg .
To get the mass of the carbon dioxide we multiply this with the fraction that is the carbon dioxide : 5.202669e+18 kg * 0.000582 = 3.027953e+15 kg , or about 3000 gigatons .
The excess of CO2 since 1850 is ( 1 – ( 280/380 ) ) * 3000 gigatons = 789 gigatons .
We can now compare this with the world carbon dioxide emission rate , which was according to this source 25,028 million tons = 25.028 gigatons in 2003 ( compare this with the emission of the volcanoes ) .
So if the rate stayed constant ( it does not , it ’s increasing ) , we can accumulate the excess in about 32 years .
Of course the emission rate was n’t as high as it is now beginning in 1850 , but you get the idea .
It gets also more complicated because a large fraction gets dissolved in the oceans .
The image is from here .
Note that the values there are the mass of the pure carbon .
To compare with carbon dioxide values , you need to multiply them by about 3.67 – carbon dioxide has one carbon atom with atomic weight 12 and two oxygen atoms with atomic weight 16 , and ( 2*16+12 ) /12 = 3.67 .
I 'm a Windows user , and I 'm out to prove Wil Shipley wrong :
Mac users love their machines ;
Windows users put up with their machines because they do n't believe there 's anything really better .
I love the Mac user base because they tend to be people who are into trying out new software and recommending it to each other and giving the little guy a chance .
Windows users have demonstrated , ipso facto , that they do not believe in the little guy .
Wil 's student talk from WWDC 2005 piles on even more criticism of stereotypical Windows users :
Windows users like going with the market leader , the " safe " choice .
Windows users do n't want to spend more for quality , so they buy crapware knockoffs of your idea instead .
Windows users never upgrade .
Windows users only use three apps : Word , IE , and ITunes .
Windows users are afraid to install new software due to the massive amount of craplets and malware saturating the market .
Them 's fightin ' words , Wil Shipley .
Well , except for the last part , which is true .
90 % of Windows software is absolute unfettered crap which should never be installed on any computer running any operating system .
Ever .
But I 'd also say Sturgeon 's Revelation applies to all media , not just Windows software .
But our 90 % is larger than your 90 % .
Despite what all the Elise - drivin ' , iPod wearin ' , Mac - lovin ' pundits would have you believe , it 's not all craplets and malware in the Windows world .
As Windows users , we should do our part to fix this .
Let 's band together and support those small software vendors writing Windows apps that not only do n't suck , they ROCK .
Let 's support the little guy who still gives a damn about creating small , beautiful , useful apps on an operating system that gets no respect .
That is why I declare today , Friday , December 1st , 2006 , Support Your Favorite Small Software Vendor Day .
I 've used Media Monkey several times to help catalog my self - ripped music collection , and I was blown away by the speed , the ease of use , and the cool features for mass - tagging my music .
And , I 'm ashamed to admit , I never paid the twenty bucks to register it .
Even after using it quite extensively .
I 'm rectifying that situation right now : even as I type this post , I 'm registering Media Monkey .
Check your hard drive , and I 'm sure you , too , will find some bit of software written by a small software development shop , maybe even a single developer .
Something you find incredibly useful .
Something you rely on every day .
Something you recommend without reservation to friends and peers .
Something that makes using the computer that much more enjoyable .
Or at least less painful .
Stop reading this post right now and buy that software .
If it 's not commercial software , do n't let that stop you .
Share the love by sending money to the person / shop / organization that created it .
This month it 's MediaMonkey .
Next month it might be ClipX , or Beyond Compare , or RegexBuddy , or TimeSnapper .
It 's time to stop floating by on the " free " version and give something back .
If I can't come up with the scratch to spend a measly $ 20 a month supporting the very best work of my fellow independent software developers , can I really call myself a professional software developer ?
Can you ?
As a Windows user , I work extra hard to avoid reinforcing all these negative stereotypes .
I believe in the little guy writing cool Windows software .
And by " believe in " , I mean " pay " .
And so should you .
Whatever operating system you choose to run , try to support the little guys writing the apps you use .
We owe it to them .
And , more importantly , we owe it to ourselves .
I have another unrelated post coming , but a quick word on insults vs. narcissistic injuries , and why this distinction is so important .
Narcissistic injuries have nothing to do with sadness .
They are always and only about rage .
The narcissist says , " I exist . "
A narcissistic injury is you showing him that he does not exist in your life .
Kicking him in the teeth and telling him he is a jerk is not a narcisstic injury -- because he must therefore exist .
Let 's say I 'm a narcissist , and you send me a 10 page letter explaining why I suck , I 'm a jerk , I 'm an idiot ; you attack my credibility , my intelligence ; and you even provide evidence for all of this , college transcripts , records from the Peters Institute , you criticize my penis size , using affidavits from past and future girlfriends -- all of this hurts me , but it is not a narcissistic injury .
A narcissistic injury would be this : I expect you to write such a letter , and you do n't bother .
This is most easily seen in the failing marriage of a narcissist .
The reason it 's important is because the reaction of the narcissist to either " insult " is different .
In the first example , he will be sad and hurt , but he will yell back , insult you , or cry and beg forgiveness or mercy -- he will respond -- maintain the relationship .
He 'll say and do outrageous things that he knows will cause you to respond again , to prolong your connections , even if they cause him misery .
He does n't care that it makes you and him miserable -- he cares only that there is a you and him .
But in the latter case where you ignore him , humiliate him -- an actual narcissisitic injury -- he will want to kill you .
----
And before everyone flames me , I am not trying to give a scientific explanation of the pathogenesis of narcissism .
This is simply one man 's opinion of how we can specify what it is , and what it may predict , past or future .
Nor am I suggesting this is n't " treatable " -- anyone can change .
It may not be easy , but it is always possible .
And I also do not mean to imply that all narcissists will kill everyone who injures them .
The point is rage .
They may never act on it , or they may break a window , or attempt suicide , etc .

A Canadian company offering alternative to gas - powered vehicles March 2 , 2007
Posted by V.E. in 2007
Two Canadian companies formed Silence Inc. a year ago to offer world an “ alternative to gas - powered vehicles without compromising performance ” .
Both of them were producing enthusiast electric vehicles before .
Previous experience of both companies will be embodied in “ Silence ” – a 3 - wheel , 2 - seat , high - performance and 100 % electric vehicle .
This vehicle is claimed to travel 125- 250 miles without recharge at a maximum speed of 125 mph .
They will be taking orders for this device this spring .
As from the specifications page , the price for the car - of - the - future will be $ 50,000 Canadian dollars .
India has not publicly blamed any group for the attacks
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf that he expected Pakistan to honour its promise to end cross - border terrorism .
The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder says India believes groups based in Pakistan or linked to them may have been involved .
Pakistan says it has no indication that Pakistani groups were involved .
A little - known Kashmiri group said it was behind the attacks .
Police say they are trying to verify the claim by Islami Inqilabi Mahaz .
Gen Musharraf has condemned the bombings and offered Pakistan 's support to the Indian investigation .
' Mere claim '
Mr Singh made the comments during a telephone call in which Gen Musharraf offered his condolences for the triple bombings , which happened in quick succession .
According to an Indian Foreign Ministry statement , Mr Singh told Gen Musharraf said he " continued to be disturbed and dismayed at indications of external linkages of terrorist groups with the 29 October bombing " .
DELHI BOMB SITES Paharganj : 16 die near train station at 1745 ( 1315 GMT ) Sarojini Nagar : 43 killed , minutes after Paharganj attack Govindpuri :
Bus driver throws bomb from vehicle - no deaths
Figures from Sunday
At -a- glance : Delhi bombs
He then " drew the president 's attention to Pakistan 's commitment to ending cross- border terrorism " .
A Pakistani foreign ministry spokeswoman said the government had no indication that Pakistani groups had been involved in the attacks .
" Unless they share the evidence with us , it remains a mere claim which we cannot accept , " she said .
India and Pakistan have been involved in a long - running dispute over the territory of Kashmir .
Earlier on Monday , Gen Musharraf said this month 's devastating earthquake in Pakistan and India provided an opportunity to help the two countries resolve their dispute .
On Sunday , the two countries opened several points along Kashmir 's line of control - the de facto border between the two countries - to provide better access for relief workers to earthquake victims .

Monster stellar flare dwarfs all others seen
NASA - GODDARD NEWS RELEASE
Posted : November 6 , 2006
Scientists using NASA 's
Swift satellite have spotted a stellar flare on a nearby star so powerful that , had it been from our sun , it would have triggered a mass extinction on Earth .
The flare was perhaps the most energetic magnetic stellar explosion ever detected .
The flare was seen in December 2005 on a star slightly less massive than the sun , in a two - star system called II Pegasi in the constellation Pegasus .
It was about a hundred million times more energetic than the sun 's typical solar flare , releasing energy equivalent to about 50 million trillion atomic bombs .
Fortunately , our sun is now a stable star that does n't produce such powerful flares .
And II Pegasi is at a safe distance of about 135 light - years from Earth . �
Yet in detecting this brilliant flare , scientists obtained direct observational evidence that stellar flares on other stars involve particle acceleration , just like on our sun .
Rachel Osten of University of Maryland and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. , presents this finding today at the Cool Stars 14 meeting in Pasadena , Calif .
" The flare was so powerful that , at first , we thought it was a star explosion , " said Osten , a Hubble Fellow .
" We know much about solar flares on the sun , but these are samples from just one star .
This II Pegasi event was our first opportunity to study details of another star 's flaring as if it were as close as our sun . "
Solar flares on the sun originate in the corona , the outermost part of the sun 's atmosphere .
The corona 's temperature is about two million degrees Fahrenheit , while the sun 's surface , called the photosphere , is only about 6,000 degrees .
The flare itself is a burst of radiation across much of the electromagnetic spectrum , from low - energy radio waves through high - energy X - rays .
The X - ray emission can last up to a few minutes on the sun ; on II Pegasi it lasted for several hours .
The flare involves a shower of electrons raining down from the corona onto the photosphere , heating the coronal gas to temperatures usually encountered only deep inside the sun .
Scientists think that the twisting and breaking of magnetic field lines lacing through the corona generate the particle acceleration and flaring .
The flaring star in II Pegasi is 0.8 times the mass of the sun ; its companion is 0.4 solar masses .
The stars are close , only a few stellar radii apart .
As a result , tidal forces cause both stars to spin quickly , rotating in step once in 7 days compared to the sun 's 28 - day rotation period .
Fast rotation is conducive to strong stellar flares .
Young stars spin fast and flare more actively , and the early sun likely generated solar flares on par with II Pegasi .
Yet II Pegasi could be at least a billion years older than our middle - aged 5 - billion - year - old sun .
" The tight binary orbit in II Pegasi acts as a fountain of youth , enabling older stars to spin and flare as strongly as young stars , " said Steve Drake of NASA Goddard , a co-author with Osten on an upcoming Astrophysical Journal paper .
The key finding in the II Pegasi flare was the detection of higher - energy X - rays .
Swift 's Burst Alert Telescope usually detects gamma-ray bursts , the most powerful explosions known , which arise from star explosions and star mergers .
The II Pegasi flare was energetic enough create a false alarm for a burst detection .
Scientists quickly knew this was a different kind of event , however , when the flare overwhelmed Swift 's X -ray Telescope , a second instrument .
Higher - energy " hard " X - ray detection in this case is the telltale signal of electron particle acceleration , creating what is called non-thermal X - rays .
NASA 's RHESSI mission sees this in the sun 's solar flares .
While lower - energy " soft " X - rays from thermal emission have been seen on other stars , scientists have never seen hard X - rays on any flaring star other than the sun .
Because the hard X - rays occur earlier in the flare and are responsible for heating the coronal gas , they reveal unique information about the flare 's initial stages .
Had the sun flared like II Pegasi , these hard X - rays would have overwhelmed the Earth 's protective atmosphere , leading to significant climate change and mass extinction .
Ironically , one theory posits that stellar particle outbursts are needed to condition dust to form into planets and perhaps life .
The Swift observation demonstrates that such outbursts do occur .
" Swift was built to catch gamma - ray bursts , but we can use its speed to catch supernovae and now stellar flares , " said Swift Project Scientist Neil Gehrels of NASA Goddard .
" We can't predict when a flare will happen , but Swift can react quickly once it senses an event .
Osten 's colleagues on this result also include Jack Tueller and Jay Cummings of NASA Goddard ; Matteo Perri of the Italian Space Agency ; and Alberto Moretti and Stefano Covino of the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics .

Hot on the heels of Faith 's article on the layered evils of Viva Pinata , this article serves to educate the average reader on the numerous moral trespasses and hidden agendas of Super Mario , and his ilk .
Will you have noticed some of these things before ?
Undoubtedly .
But have you noticed ALL of them ?
Unlikely .
1 . Where do mushroom powerups come from ?
Consider the following .
The Mushroom Kingdom is so named because the majority of its denizens have very mushroom - shaped heads .
Toad , and his hundreds of identical brothers who consistently manage to get kidnapped in Bowser 's castles , have heads that are essentially mushrooms with eyes .
But what about the mushroom powerups that Mario consumes in order to get bigger , or gain an extra life ?
What do THEY look like ?
Well , mushrooms .
But where do these mushrooms come from ?
Even after jumping through more than half a dozen worlds in the mushroom kingdom , have you seen a SINGLE mushroom FIELD ?
One can then only conclude that these powerup mushrooms are not created naturally , but are in fact artificially made ( and then evidently put into large question - marked boxes ) .
What conclusion can we draw from these facts ?
Simple .
MARIO IS EATING THE DECAPITATED HEADS OF THE MUSHROOM PEOPLE .
2. Super Mario Bros serves as an allegory for the Bolshevik Revolution .
This one we 've all heard before .
Red outfit , Stalinesque mustache , star on the flag , overthrowing an empire .
Yeah , yeah .
I only mention it to state that the kind of people who bring this up in regular conversation with their friends are probably the kind of people who get made fun of when they are n't around .
So be sure not to do that .
3. Racism .
He 's fat , he 's a plumber , he 's got a mustache , he speaks broken English , and he 's pussy - whipped .
The only way Mario could be any more of an Italian stereotype is if he had to eat pasta instead of mushrooms , or if he shot people in the back of the head and dumped them in the Hudson Bay .
Now , I can understand that Charles Martinet 's voice acting can be pretty cute at times , but honestly .
Despite what Nintendo thinks , there are Italians in America who are capable of saying " It 's me , Mario " without adding the letter " A " to the end or beginning of every single goddamned word .
And despite the fact that he 's a plumber , has anyone ever seen him do any plumbing ?
At all ?
He can go down enormous , man -sized pipes , yeah , but he does n't even carry a goddamn wrench , much less an assortment of tools necessary to perform any degree of adequate pipe maintenance .
The job description just seems to paint him as another member of the stereotypically blue collar , working class immigrant population in America .
Which says something about how Japan views the US .
4 . This picture .
5. Mario is an addict .
It may have taken some of us longer than others to make the connection , but at some point Mario 's innocent mushroom and flower powerups begin to take on a much more sinister , substance - abuse - related - meaning .
Consider the mushroom powerup in relation to the famous drug-use song " White Rabbit " :
" One pill makes you larger . "
" One pill makes you small . "
And what about the fire flowers ?
Even disregarding the obvious drug implication , how was Mario supposed to use the flower to shoot fireballs ?
Did he just hold it ?
Eat it ?
Put it in his pocket or something ?
Or how about the leaves that turn you into a raccoon ?
Is there ANY connection between touching a leaf and turning into a raccoon that you can see ?
Anything at all ?
The only rational answer is that all of these " transformations " are nothing more than visual and auditory hallucinations , brought on by heavy drug use .
The mushrooms Mario is so fond of are of the " magic , " hallucinatory variety , the flowers he eats to produce fire are obviously some sort of illegal poppy blossom , and the magic leaves that make him turn into a flying raccoon ... well , you figure it out .
6. Murder .
See ?
Not so fun from the Goomba 's position .
Now , regardless of whether or not the Goombas are actually working for Bowser , they certainly do n't seem like killers , or even soldiers .
They walk around aimlessly , and if you touch them , you get hurt .
Is that worth killing over ?
It 's not even like they attack Mario once they see him : they just walk back and forth along a predetermined path , and if Mario touches them , it 's his own fault .
But , instead of doing the merciful thing and avoiding them , Mario takes it upon himself to stomp every last weaponless Goomba to death , for no good reason .
Actually , when you think about it , Mario 's got it pretty easy : almost none of his enemies actively try to attack him , so the only thing he really has to worry about is falling down bottomless pits and getting hit by Bowser 's traps .
And , really , how hard is it to avoid non-sentient weaponry ?
That being said , I shed no tears for the Hammer Bros .
They can go to hell .

Rain barrels offer a great way to store up some rain for use in watering the lawn or garden or even cleaning the car or giving water to live stock .
But do n’t take my word for it , listen to Lars from cleanairgardening .com .
If you thought the 50 gallon demo was sweet , wait till you see that 60 ( !!!) gallon demo .
Can you handle ten more gallons , can you !
All joking aside ( why did they feel the need for two videos ? ) rain barrels really are a great way to use what nature already provides us ( and use it when we want ) .
But what if you do n’t like the barrel look of your rain barrel .
These rain barrel designs are for you .
For every 1000 square feet of roof space being used to capture rain you can expect to catch around 600 gallons from one inch of rain fall ( at a theoretical 100 % catch rate ) .
Some larger roofs can easily be 2000 + square feet .
So thinking about saving a bit of money on your water bill , and want to get a barrel for yourself .
Here are some places to buy a nice rain barrel ( I in no way endorse any of these places , and you should do your research before ordering anything from any of them ) .
Want to do it yourself , check out instructions for a DIY rain barrel system here .

Recently , I went and had a beer or five with an attractive young man who ’d been e-mailing me since we met at a party in late spring .
After six hours of chatting and a half - hour of stumbling through the sticky summer night , he was still talking – lingering , I would argue – in front of my door at two in the morning .
I was tired .
He was cute .
I leaned in for the good - night kiss .
A look of wild horror swept his face , and he screamed , “ Whoa ! Hey ! ” as if I had grabbed his crotch .
Or his wallet .
I shrugged and went inside my apartment .
Whoa .
Hey .
I flatter myself to think that my lips headed toward someone else ’s might elicit a response like Score !
Or perhaps Okay .
But apparently I overestimate my powers .
It took a few days for me to stop cringing at the memory , but really I was fine .
That ’s the way it goes .
My friend Emma had just returned a few days earlier from a booty call to Los Angeles that went belly - up .
She ’d met a film producer at a wedding a few months back , and they ’d been , natch , e-mailing ever since .
Sometimes , the messages would even end with “ What are you wearing ? ”
So she was flummoxed to find herself sitting on his bed untouched while he fussed around his room looking for CDs and reasons not to come near her .
Eventually he asked , “ Are you comfortable ?
You do n’t seem comfortable . ”
Emma ’s not much for pitter - patter .
“ It ’s just that I kind of thought when I was out here we ’d be having sex , ” she told him .
“ But we will have sex , ” he said .
“ Tonight I just have to go to a birthday party . ”
He never called her again .
( To add insult to injury , he was signed by Mike Ovitz a few days later . )
All this begs the obvious question , What the hell ?
I started asking around to find out whether it was just us or if men have actually banded together in a conspiracy not to put out .
“ I basically refuse to sleep with any more people , ” says one well - known writer , confirming the worst .
“ If you ’re a man in my position , which is to say 35 , single , hetero , HIV - negative , solvent , good - enough - looking , and not a banker asshole , you could have a lot of sex if that ’s what you wanted .
But I just realized I ’d slept with enough people . ”
“ We will have sex , ” he said .
“ But tonight I ’m going to a birthday party . ”
He never called again .
( To add insult to injury , he was signed by Ovitz days later . )
Hmm , enough people .
How can one tell ?
“ I reached this point where I was sleeping with women more because I was expected to than because I wanted to , ” he explains .
“ Right before I entered this phase – ‘ the New Purity , ’ I call it – I fooled around with this woman at a wedding .
She clearly wanted to pursue something ; she was very persistent .
Finally I said , ‘ Listen , I just do n’t think we ’re a good match . ’
She said , ‘ Okay , but we could just have some fun . ’
The implication was pretty clear , ” he tells me , practically winking .
“ It stunned me , ” he continues .
Here ’s this woman who wants to have the kind of relationship that men have always wanted – and it ’s not to her advantage ! ”
Well , not if you turn her down it is n’t , but what if you ’d said yes ?
“ I do n’t buy the idea that women are sexual machines like men are ; the wiring is a little different .
I watch Sex and the City , and I ’m like , those whores !
How incredibly shallow they are to bed - hop in this way !
I think it makes them really unappealing and really unsexy .
Pathetic , actually . ”
Youch .
Pathetic whore is much worse than whoa hey .
But why does he reserve so much contempt for women who want “ what men have always wanted ” – what he wanted not long ago ?
It sounds like what ’s really at stake here is power – surprise !
– rather than sex .
Possibly , Mr. Purity ’s feelings reflect a grim , larger truth : that all along , men were in it more for the conquest than for the bumping and grinding that used to follow it .
Now that sex is offered freely , they wonder , can it really be so great after all ?
As for “ the wiring , ” I do n’t buy the idea that women are like men , either .
“ Women were always thought to be the more lascivious gender , ” says John Jay College professor Carol Groneman , who has just published a history of nymphomania .
“ Look at Greek mythology , or even at the first temptress , Eve .
It was n’t until the eighteenth century that women were recast as modest and submissive .
Historians have linked this to the rise of the bourgeoisie and their desire to differentiate themselves from a debauched lower class . ”
That ’s all well and good , but I can remember a time when men wanted sex .
You could set your clock to it .
Some of the other men I spoke with had considerably gentler perceptions of women who enjoy the occasional romp , but that still does n’t mean they were about to join in .
“ If girls like having a lot of sex , they should have it , ” says a generous 27 - year - old Internet entrepreneur .
“ But for me … Look , if I could be granted a wish , and it was like every time I ’d be great , it ’d be fun , then I ’d do it all the time , ” he says .
“ But you do n’t know when you wo n’t be able to … you never know .
And you do n’t want all the girls to gab about it . ”
Ah. Performance anxiety .
Well , you ca n’t really hold that against a guy .
If my body betrayed my boredom or fear in intimate situations , I ’d never let it out of the house .
But there are plenty of men out there who have every confidence in their prowess and refuse to share it with others all the same .
“ When I was younger , I was crazy for girls – they were the focal point of my life , ” says a 28 - year - old art director who works in fashion , carries a man purse , and looks very much like a male model .
“ I can remember times when I slept with three or four women in a single day .
But then I started feeling like , why ?
You get what you pay for with sex , and it ’s more satisfying if you ’ve actually invested something . ”
This I find persuasive .
Many of us would prefer sex with a loved one to yet another anonymous coupling that culminates with “ Okay , bye . ”
If there were a sign - up sheet for perfect love , I would pay good money to get my name on it .
But I am not aware of any such list .
Just parties , blind dates , bars , friends of friends .
So even if we want the real thing just as much as our newly pure gentlemen friends do , in the absence of a list , we assess the situation and do what men have always done ( until lately , anyway ) .
We say , Fuck it , and do .
So what happened to men – men ! – to make them so sensitive ?
Partly , they would have us believe , it ’s a response to the New Impurity of women .
To hear these soft men talk , you ’d think they were regularly surrounded by drooling packs of Do Me Feminists out trolling for sex in the moonlight .
And if they have n’t actually encountered these succubi in the flesh , they ’ve seen them on television or in the movies , undulating insatiably in thongs , writhing in bandeau tops .
Apparently , all it took to propel a Victorian man into a frenzy of desire was a little flash of ankle , an understated peep show in a world of repression .
Could it be that men are now so saturated with Britney ’s midriff and J - Lo ’s backside that all it takes to propel them into a world of repression is an understated peep show of female desire ?
Or are they just plum tuckered out ?
My last undersexed suitor unexpectedly gave me his pitch for A Weekend Away just before he turned 38 .
“ Ambition has been my partner , ” he said earnestly one night at dinner , after we ’d been dating sporadically for about five months .
“ I want to experience intimacy with a person . ”
So I bought a bikini and he somehow managed to rent a car the Thursday before the Fourth of July , and we headed for Montauk .
Our room was beautiful , on the water .
We went out on a boat and caught unthinkably large bass and bluefish , which we barbecued in the moonlight at his friend ’s house near Georgica Pond .
He did n’t touch me once the whole time .
It was a long weekend .
Ambition is often the soft man ’s invisible other woman .
I would later find out – via e-mail , that most pervasive and passive - aggressive form of romantic communication – that he had been preoccupied with a pending lawsuit at his ad firm during that interminable holiday vacation .
Exhausted from the endless pursuit of success , it is all the soft man can do to get a girl to the bar or the beach .
Once he has her there , he ’d rather use her shoulder to cry on than her anything else for anything else .
It ’s not all that bad , really .
Emma put it best when she returned from L.A. with nothing to show for her troubles .
“ I ’m all right , ” she told me .
“ I ’m just gagging for a shagging . ”
Do we really want these creepy humanoid robots to replace humans ?
Maybe so , but decide for yourself after the break .
For now , EveR - 1 can be employed as a guide robot at museums and department stores or as an educational model to read books to children , ” Baeg said .
But we are looking further ahead _ we are working on upgrading the android with the aim of making it move its legs by the end of this year .
It will be able to sit down and stand up by then , ” he expects .

This Albert Einstein - inspired robot “ is the first ever walking robot with humanlike expressions . ”
Our Frubber material makes this possible , because it requires MUCH less force to move into facial expressions than do previous materials–less than 1/20th the force and energy than the softest animatronics materials , according to published tests .
This means that the Albert head can run for hours on AA batteries , so it can be mobile and mount on a walking robot body

In the last decade , monthly Saudi Arabian oil production has undergone cyclic decline on 4 occasions - 1998 , 2001 , 2003 and 2006 .
So how can anyone be sure that the present production decline signals a terminal slide in Saudi production ?
First of all congratulations to Stuart for busting some records with his post " Saudi Arabian oil declines 8 % in 2006 " published on 2nd March .
I was unavailable to comment that day but feel there are several cautionary observations that need to be made before jumping to any conclusion about the end of the oil age .
If Stuart is right , and he may be , then the consequences may be dire .
Annual oil production for Saudi Arabia C+C+NGL .
From 1965 the data are from the BP statistical review .
The annual average production data from BP show that since 1970 there have been 8 peaks in Saudi oil production followed by decline .
( note that BP quote crude + condensate + natural gas liquids ( C+C+NGL ) while the eia data are C+C ) .
There is no disputing that the declines following peaks 1 to 7 were caused by voluntary restraint , Saudi Arabia playing the roll of swing producer .
The big question is whether recent declines from peak number 8 are voluntary or not ?
Stuart is arguing that at the beginning of 2005 , Saudi Arabia switched from swing producer to a supply constrained producer and the main lines of his argument are :
" They have never had declining production in the face of high and rising prices before .
And they have never had supply side events show through in the production profile before " ( from email correspondence )
So lets examine these two cornerstones of Stuart 's argument .
Oil Price
According to the Energy Information Agency ( eia ) , the decline in Saudi production began in April 2006 .
The oil price was indeed still rising at this time and did not peak until June 2006 .
But since June 2006 both oil price and Saudi production have been falling .
The June 2006 oil price peak was the final spurt of a speculative boom fuelled by rising demand for oil , a narrowing of spare productive capacity and international tension over Iran , Iraq , North Korea to name but a few tense areas .
High oil prices worked their magic , dampened demand growth and stimulated a global exploration and production effort with the oil industry working flat out , everywhere .
There is no shortage of oil throughout the OECD .
US and European inventories remain high .
Faced with this scenario , it seems plausible to me that Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries have cut production in order to support prices at the $ 60 level which does not seem to present any problem to the developed world economies .
That is what the Saudis say they have done and I can see no evidence or reason to doubt it .
Supply Side Events
So what about Stuart 's assertion that commissioning of the Haradh gas oil separation plant ( GOSP ) is recognisable as a 300 kbpd blip on the decline curve .
Whilst I am not entirely convinced by this chart , produced by averaging three of four data sources , I am happy to accept the possibility that it may be a valid observation and offer an alternative explanation .
Falling Saudi Arabian oil production , monthly averages from three sources - the US EIA , the OECD iea and JODI .
From Staniford " Saudi Arabian oil declines 8 % in 2006 "
The Saudis have to run their oil production on different planning time scales .
The planning and construction of the Haradh 3 GOSP probably took several years and of course , once complete it was immediately commissioned .
At the same time the Saudis claimed they were cutting production in response to flat world demand for oil .
They have done this many times before and it seems likely that inefficient production from wells with high water cut and from low permeability reservoirs would be shut down ( see below ) .
There is no conflict between the Saudis cutting production from inefficient wells simultaneous with new , dry oil production being brought on stream .
The 300 kbpd blip , if valid , may therefore reflect new production coming on at a time of voluntary restraint .
Mothballed wells add to the Saudi 's reserve capacity .
The Smoking Gun
There has been much debate about the increase in the number of oil drilling rigs operating in Saudi Arabia which are up from around 17 in 2004 to over 50 in 2006 .
The fact that oil production has actually fallen whilst the number of rigs has increased in seen by many as a sign of crisis .
Saudi oil rig count compared with variations in the US rig count , believed to be onshore and offshore rigs .
Whilst the relative growth in Saudi rigs is high ( approximate 3 fold increase ) this is starting from a very low baseline and the absolute rise of around 40 rigs over two years is trivial compared to the production volumes .
International rig count and US rig count from Baker Hughes .
Another way of looking at this however , is that Saudi Arabia maintained oil production capacity of over 9 million bpd for many years with only 17 drilling rigs .
The recent increase is very modest in absolute terms .
The additional rigs may be drilling new developments such as Khurais , reported to be using 23 rigs , which are not yet on stream .
But even when these new developments come on , Saudi production may not necessarily rise - because the market is currently satiated .
The Quality of Saudi Reservoirs
Most of the oil reservoirs in the Middle East are limestone and the quality of those reservoirs is highly variable .
Without going into detail , Saudi reservoirs have two significant problems which are both related to permeability ( the ease with which fluids may fow through the rock ) .
Low permeability reservoirs - not surprisingly , the Saudis developed their best ( high permeability ) reservoirs first and are now having to fall back upon the second tier , lower permeability assets .
The problem is amply demonstrated in Ghawar where the north end of the field has fabulous reservoir quality , average permeability over 500 mD , whilst the south end of the field ( which still contains a lot of oil ) has poor reservoir quality with average permeability under 70 mD ( see below ) .
The low permeability reservoirs produce more slowly and require a larger number of wells ( hence the increase in drilling rigs ? ) .
Saudi reservoir engineers will welcome the opportunity to rest the low permeability reservoirs to allow pressure to rebound as described by Matthew Simmons on p171 of Twilight in the Dessert .
High permeability streaks - also known as super -K horizons .
These lead to injected water flooding producers prematurely and unpredictably giving rise to the much - publicised problems associated with water flooding and reservoir management .
Again , reservoir and petroleum engineers would welcome any opportunity to trade wells with high water cut for new dry oil production .
Wells mothballed on grounds of high water cut or low reservoir pressure will benefit from the rest and when production is resumed , as needs require , they will for a short while perform much better than prior to shutdown .
average porosity average permeability Ain Dar 19 % 617 mD Shedgum 19 % 639 mD Uthmaniyah 18 % 220 mD Hawiyah 17 % 68 mD Haradh 14 % 52mD

A balanced perspective
There is little doubt that Saudi oil production has fallen steadily since April 2006 .
The fact that this can be measured in four different ways means very little .
It would be surprising if the different agencies were not in general agreement with each other .
means very little .
It would be surprising if the different agencies were not in general agreement with each other .
In my opinion , there is no hard evidence to support that this fall in production is involuntary .
Similarly , there is no hard evidence to prove it is voluntary .
But given the long history of Saudi Arabia acting as global swing producer , in my opinion , hard evidence would be required to prove that this had ceased to be the case .
Such evidence may include : 1 ) falling global oil production 2 ) escalating oil prices and 3 ) falling OECD inventories .
Right now , none of these tests are satisfied .
Saudi petroleum engineers would welcome the opportunity to rest wells with low reservoir pressure or high water cuts and their is no conflict is substituting this type of inefficient production for dry oil production from new projects .
I am in total agreement that Saudi oil production is entering a new era .
In the past , over 9 million barrels per day could be achieved with relative ease .
Their best assets are mature and may be in decline .
In the future , much greater effort will probably be required to sustain production over 9 million barrels per day .
That $ 1000 bet
I am trying to bring some balance to the debate on Saudi oil production .
On the one hand , Saudi Aramco and the eia are forecasting " forever rising " production whilst Matthew Simmons now joined by Stuart are forecasting rapid and terminal decline in Saudi oil production .
As is often the case , reality probably lies somewhere between these two extremes .
I 'll bet $ 1000 with the first person who cares to take me up on it that the international oil agencies will never report sustained Saudi production of crude + condensate of 10.7 million barrels or more .
Stuart Staniford , 2nd March 2007
High stakes and long odds !
If Stuart was so confident that Saudi production was heading south for good then he would not have set the bar so high .
In Congresswoman Jean Schmidt 's world , all those wounded soldiers at Walter Reed must have been lying .
And , Dana Priest and Anne Hull from the Washington Post ( who will probably win awards for their reporting ) were just causing trouble .
Schmidt has a different story to tell about Walter Reed :
Rep. Jean Schmidt wrote in her weekly column sent out to reporters on Monday that stories about horrible conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center were " overblown . "
Schmidt , a Clermont County Republican , decided to take " several hours " to travel to the hospital in Washington , D.C. , to see the situation " first hand . "
Her conclusion ?
" I found the situation at Walter Reed to be overblown by both politicians and the media . "
She is a typical Republican who does not support the troops .
She really is despicable .
Hat tip Talking Points Memo
I 've been conned again by the Bush administration .
One reason I was skeptical of the surge was its very low troop levels .
I could n't see how a mere 17,500 new troops would change the dynamic in any meaningful way .
And it has n't .
Yes , we 've seen some calm in Baghdad , as Shiite militias lie low , but we 've also seen stepped up Sunni violence in Baghdad 's periphery .
Now , in response to " whack - a - mole , " it appears that Petraeus wants another full brigade .
When you add that to the extra 4,600 announced March 10 , the surge is now just shy of 30,000 more troops .
Rich Lowry claims vindication .
Huh ?
The only vindication is that Lowry believed that Bush was lying back in January , and Lowry , it appears , was right .
Why did Bush " low - ball , " i.e. deceive us about the numbers ?
My best bet is that he thought if he actually told people we'd be sending 30,000 more troops ( and maybe more ) , Americans would balk .
I would have been more impressed , of course , and more inclined to support it .
But this is beside the point .
The point is : why is it beyond this president to tell the truth to the American people in wartime ?
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Global warming on Neptune ’s moon Triton as well as Jupiter and Pluto , and now Mars has some scratching their heads over what could possibly be in common with the warming of all these planets .
In the meantime , some have noticed an interesting relationship between solar activity and temperature proxies via ice cores going back thousands of years :
I still do n’t know .
Could there be something in common with all the planets in our solar system that might cause them all to warm at the same time ?
Computer security researchers said on Wednesday they have discovered a vulnerability in Adobe 's ubiquitous Acrobat Reader software that allows cyber - intruders to attack personal computers through trusted web links .
Virtually any website hosting Portable Document Format , or PDF , files are vulnerable to attack , according to researchers from Symantec and VeriSign 's iDefense Intelligence .
The attacks could range from stealing cookies that track a user 's web browsing history to the creation of harmful worms , the researchers said .
An MIT Professor says that hurricanes have been getting more powerful over the last few decades , and warns that the trend is likely to continue .
He says that global warming is a contributory factor .
In a paper appearing in the online edition of the journal Nature Kerry Emmanuel , professor of meteorology in MIT 's Department of Earth , Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences , writes :
" My results suggest that future warming may lead to an upward trend in [ hurricanes ' ] destructive potential , and - taking into account an increasing coastal population - a substantial increase in hurricane - related losses in the 21st century . "
Emanuel analysed data from tropical cyclones dating back to the middle of the last century , tracking the amount of energy released by each storm , the duration of the storm and its top windspeed .
He found that since the 1970's , the storms have become more energetic , around half as fast again , and last on average 50 per cent longer .
The results are broadly in line with computer simulations of the impact of climate change on hurricane intensity .
The increase has also happened in parallel with an increase in the average surface temperature of the world 's oceans .
Some of this temperature increase can be ascribed to global warming , Emanuel says . ®

In case anyone disputes the increasingly fascist nature of US federal anti-terror efforts , they should to check out the 7/11/06 front page Wall St. Journal article ( left column ) titled " A Muslim 's Choice : Turn US Informant or Risk Losing Visa . "
This chilling story details what happened to a legal immigrant green card visa holder who found himself in the clutches of what can only be described as the FBI 's version of a cartoonish Gestapo - style recruitment effort .
[ Unfortunately the Wall St. Journal on line edition is subscription only , so no direct link to the full story can be provided ] .
Yassine Ouassif doubtless considered himself lucky when in 2001 , at age 18 he won a coveted US green card visa in an annual lottery which enabled him to leave his native Morocco and come to live and work in the United States .
Mr. Ouassif 's stay in this country was uneventful , as he worked as a laborer and security guard and was studying to become an engineer .
He married his first cousin in Morocco in 2003 .
As the WSJ reports it :
Mr. Ouassif 's troubles began last September after he visited his wife in Morocco .
He took off from Paris on a flight back to San Francisco .
Three hours later the pilot announced the flight was returning to Paris .
Two French policemen escorted Mr. Ouassif off the plane .
French authorities told him that the US would not permit the plane to land with him onboard , he says , they told him they did n't know why , he says .
They put him on the next flight to Casablanca .
Moroccan security officials met Mr. Ouassif at the airport and grilled him all night and for much of the next day , he says .
At one point they told him he'd " never see the sun again " if he did n't tell them why the US would turn back a French jet just because he was aboard , he says .
According to the WSJ account , even today no federal officials will comment on his presence on the " no fly " list , despite the fact that he has never been accused of any terrorist acts or suspicious activity .
He soon decided to return home to San Francisco , this time flying to Montreal and taking a bus to the border .
He was too scared to fly given his Kafkaesque status with the feds .
The immigration inspector wondered why he flew to Canada and did n't buy Mr. Ouassif 's story that the Canadian scenery was worth the detour .
As the WSJ then reports :
[ Mr. Ouassif ] was handcuffed and placed in a holding cell for several hours , he says .
An immigration officer interviewed him at length about his life and religious views .
…
Immigration officers had taken his green card .
Under normal circumstances [ FBI Special Agent Michael ]
Lonergan told him , he would have been sent to a Buffalo detention center to await deportation proceedings , according to Mr. Ouassif .
He 'd been spared , Mr. Lonergan told him , by a call from Dan , his FBI colleague in San Francisco .
Special Agent Dan Fliflet wanted Mr. Ouassif to come to San Francisco , but not by plane , and to call him as soon as he arrived .
According to Mr. Ouassif , Mr. Lonergan told him that Mr. Fliflet would decide whether he would get back his green card or be deported .
Mr. Ouassif was ordered to report to an immigration interview in San Francisco three weeks later , on Dec. 14 .
Upon meeting " Dan " in a walk - and - talk on the streets of Oakland , Mr. Ouassif found himself being told he had a choice of becoming a Bureau informant , spying on his local mosque Muslim friends , or being stripped of his green card and deported forthwith .
These thuggish threats are right out of a WWII propaganda film , though I 'm guessing without the classic sinister German accent .
The Journal 's account continues :
Mr. Fliflet gave Mr. Ouassif one week to consider the FBI 's offers to become an informant in exchange for his green card , according to Mr. Ouassif .
If he did n't hear from him , the FBI agent said , he 'd assume Mr. Ouassif " prefers to help extremists " instead of America , according to Mr. Ouassif .
Mr. Fliflet warned him the FBI had ample evidence to prove he was an extremist , Mr. Ouassif says .
Mr. Fliflet told him not to tell anyone about their meeting , including his lawyer .
Mr. Ouassif soon decided he did n't want to become an FBI snitch , because to do so would be a hypocritical sin according to the Quran .
While he had previously said he would report any suspicious terrorist activity voluntarily , on his own , he feared becoming a lifelong informant unable to escape the visa blackmail he was being offered .
He returned two weeks later for his scheduled immigration interview , though he brought his attorney Banafsheh Aklaghi , founder of a San Francisco nonprofit group , National Legal Sanctuary for Community Advancement .
Immigration agents peppered him with questions , including many involving a former roommate who had returned to his native Baghdad and had been either arrested or killed there , though they had n't been close friends .
The Journal continues :
Two agents told Mr. Ouassif they intended to detain him for deportation .
His lawyer asked why .
Mr. Ouassif says the agents did n't answer .
He was handcuffed and put in a holding cell .
Through a cell window , his lawyer told him he was slated for detention in Eloy , Ariz one of the highest - security facilities in the federal system .
Mr. Ouassif cried .
About three hours later , he says , the immigration agent took him aside without his attorney and asked if he still wanted to fight deportation .
He said he did .
Within minutes , he says , another immigration officer gave him surprising news : he was free to go .
The Homeland Security lawyer on duty had refused to sign his detention order , citing a lack of evidence , his attorney , Ms. Aklaghi was told .
Months later , in early April of this year , his green card was returned to him .
He also learned the reason for this nightmarish treatment .
As the Journal describes it :
Mr. Ouassif had been secretly recorded by an FBI informant talking to friends in a San Francisco mosque .
A Homeland Security lawyer , [ Ms. Aklaghi ] says , did not specify what Mr. Ouassif had said , but told her his statements did not indicate criminal intent and were fully protected by the First Amendment .
Nevertheless , his statements had landed him on the no-fly list , Ms. Aklaghi says , and led to all his subsequent travails .
Mr. Ouassif is now a licensed security guard pulling double shifts at a nuclear power plant , though he still worries about his no - fly status and whether or not he will be able to bring his wife to America .
FBI spokesmen in the article would only mouth platitudes about " we 're learning too " and " we need to understand where the boundaries are for them , as well as us . "
Nice to know that our modern American Gestapo has that New Age vocabulary touch .
It should be noted that all of this was the result of a surreptitious tape recording made in a Muslim church , containing nothing that even the government could consider illegal conspiracy or advocacy of violence or terror .
It was totally manufactured for the express purpose of using this secret government " terrorist " evidence to extort cooperation after a sufficient period of incarcerating and browbeating the victim here .
We can also expect ( someday , maybe ) to learn that this was no isolated incident .
Every immigrant or green card visa holder can and depending on circumstances , will be treated as mere pawns for FBI extortion purposes , to be recruited as informers and spies , and possibly agents provocateurs , should the need arise .
Most Americans , brainwashed by government propaganda and media glorification of our own police state operators , may well be shocked that this goes on .
Or perhaps think that non US citizens can and should be treated like Stalin 's own citizens or East German Stasi fodder , squeezed and threatened until they start sending in reports on their friends , family and neighbors .
And of course that old Soviet favorite , spying on fellow churchgoers …
But the Wall St. Journal is no leftist broadsheet wailing about the Bush police state .
No more staunch advocate of domestic fascism and Bush imperialism can be found in daily publication .

Ishinosuke Uwano is travelling back on a Ukraine passport
Ishinosuke Uwano was serving with the Japanese Imperial Army in Russia 's Sakhalin Island when the war ended .
He was last reported seen there in 1958 .
The 83 - year - old has now reappeared , in Ukraine , where he is married and has a family , Japanese officials say .
Mr Uwano is due to visit Japan for the first time in six decades on Wednesday .
He is expected to visit his surviving family members and friends in Iwate , 290 miles ( 467 km ) northeast of Tokyo , with his son before returning to Ukraine on 28 April , the AFP news agency reported .
The family 's last reported sighting of him was on Sakhalin in 1958 ; after that they lost all contact with him .
In 2000 , they recorded his disappearance under a Japanese law which says those soldiers who did not return after World War II can be registered as war dead .
His details were removed from the official family registry and , because of this , Mr Uwano must " return to Japan technically as a Ukrainian citizen with a Ukraine passport , " a government official said .
The Japanese authorities are now restoring him to the family registry .
Strong interest
Mr Uwano 's existence came to light last year after he asked friends in Ukraine to help him contact the Japanese government , which then sent officials to interview him in Kiev .
He was one of thousands of Japanese soldiers and civilians who were left stranded across the Pacific and in parts of China and Russia after the war ended .
Some were kept as prisoners and forced to work as slave labourers , others chose to remain of their own accord .
Why Mr Uwano remained in Russia , and how he ended up in Ukraine , has not been disclosed .
There is still much interest in Japan in the plight of former soldiers who never made it home , the BBC's Chris Hogg in Tokyo says .
Last year , Japanese officials returned empty - handed after going to a remote Philippine village to investigate reports that two former Imperial Army members were hiding there .
Two of the dead were parents of a young daughter who was nearby
The Alouette 2 helicopter crashed at the Chez Bob restaurant on a road between Salin - de - Giraud and Arles , in the Camargue region .
Two of the dead were decapitated while the injured woman had her leg severed , rescuers said .
The four people on board the helicopter were unhurt .
In shock
Police sources told Reuters news agency the helicopter was carrying guests who had been at a lunch at the restaurant .
Their dining companions had walked up the garden to bid them farewell when the helicopter came down , the sources said .
Two of the dead were parents .
Their five - year - old daughter was at the scene but was unhurt .
A witness told AFP news agency : " The pilot is very shocked .
He explained that the helicopter seemed to fail and he was unable to steady it . "
The man , thought to be in his 70s , was seen in South Inch by a passer - by at about 1000 GMT on Thursday .
The witness was concerned he would be seen by children at a nearby park .
A Tayside Police spokesman said the man put his clothes back on and drove off .
The man 's scooter is believed to have a top speed of 3mph .
I first hear it as I ’m coming out of a turn on the track at the University of Pretoria ’s High Performance Centre .
It ’s 100 meters to the finish line .
I ’m pumping my legs as fast as I can when a sort of snick snick snick snick starts getting louder , like I ’m being chased by a giant pair of scissors .
At 50 meters to go , the sound is at my left shoulder , and then Oscar Pistorius blows past me ; the snick snick fades away ahead .
By the time I cross the finish line , the South African sprinter has already turned around and is catching his breath , leaning forward , hands on his knees .
He ran 200 meters .
I ran only 150 ; he spotted me the difference .
Still , his win comes as no surprise .
Two years ago Pistorius ran the 200 in 21.34 seconds , matching the women ’s world record time set by Florence Griffith Joyner in 1988 and missing the qualifying time for the 2008 Olympics by just three - quarters of a second .
“ Nice running , bru , ” Pistorius says in his Afrikaans - tinged lilt .
Then he turns his attention to a pair of sprinters from the women ’s track team , stretching before their workout .
He suggests they upgrade to more streamlined running gear : bikinis .
“ Naughty ! ” one of them squeals , tousling his frosted curly hair .
Pistorius and I grab bottles of water , and then he trots to the infield .
He sits , undoes a couple of straps , and tosses his legs onto the grass .
The Cheetahs , elegant , swooping lengths of carbon - fiber composite , are
better at running than walking .
I ’m not the only runner who has learned to dread the scissoring sound of Oscar Pistorius .
Marlon Shirley and Brian Frasure , both of whom are below - the - knee single amputees , were the world ’s top two runners going into the Athens Paralympics in 2004 .
Shirley finished in 22.67 seconds , breaking Frasure ’s world record for a one - legged amputee .
But they were racing for silver .
Three strides ahead , Pistorius had demolished them both , clocking a time of 21.97 .
Since Athens , Pistorius has been running in Paralympic events , but also against able - bodied runners .
After overhauling his training regimen and working with redesigned , customized prototype prosthetics , Pistorius is on pace to run the 200 - and 400 - meter sprints fast enough to earn a spot on South Africa ’s Olympic team .
He ’d be the first amputee runner to cross over .
Pistorius is forcing the sports world to rethink what it means to be a disabled athlete .
Is he so close to world - class that his limitations , his prosthetic legs , represent a disadvantage ?
Or are the Cheetahs an advantage , an artificial enhancement that makes him faster than he would be if he had natural legs ?
After all , improvements in human performance are normally limited by biology and evolution .
Not in Pistorius ’ case .
His legs are constantly upgraded by a pit crew of Icelandic gearheads at one of the world ’s most sophisticated prosthetic manufacturing facilities .
No one expects able - bodied runners to compete head - to - head with wheelchair - bound marathoners .
The wheels confer an obvious speed advantage , and maybe Oscar Pistorius ’
Cheetahs do , too .
So the real question is this :
Do able - bodied athletes need protection from him ?
Pistorius was born in Johannesburg , South Africa , in 1986 , with five digits on each hand and two toes on each tiny foot .
Each leg was missing its fibula , the long , thin bone that anchors the calf muscle and forms the outside of the ankle .
His parents had a choice : consign their child to a wheelchair or amputate his lower legs and let him learn to walk with prosthetics .
His father , Henke , head of the family ’s zinc - mining company , asked a dozen orthopedic surgeons which three doctors in the world they would choose to perform a lower - leg amputation on their own child .
Of the top three they named , two were in the US and one was in South Africa .
A month before Oscar ’s first birthday , Gerry Versveld removed the baby boy ’s legs halfway between his knees and ankles .
Six months later , Oscar took his first steps , on a pair of fiberglass pegs .
Spending a week with Pistorius makes you feel slow in all sorts of ways .
When I hear he is going to pick me up at the airport , I figure someone will drive him there to meet me , or maybe he ’ll be driving a car modified with hand controls for accelerating and braking .
I am mistaken .
As I emerge from customs , he picks me out of the blinking crowd with a shout , grabs my suitcase , and bounds up a set of stairs ahead of me on a pair of “ street ” prosthetics .
I look surreptitiously at his baggy jeans for some sign that he does n’t have biological legs .
Maybe he looks a little bowlegged .
His car is modified , but not in the way I ’d imagined .
It ’s a little black sled straight out of The Fast and the Furious — a low - slung , five - speed manual SEAT Ibiza hatchback with about 4 inches of ground clearance .
oscar pistorius is emblazoned across the doors in 6 - inch - high white letters above the name of his sponsor , Hatfield Motors .
Slaloming along the N1 freeway between Pretoria and Johannesburg at about 125 percent of the speed limit , Pistorius hands me his cell phone to show me a text message he just received .
“ I go back to Denmark in 2 weeks .
I want to have as much fun as possible before I go .
What are u doing 2nite ? ”
He tells me he ’s going to decline this invitation — he ’s quite sweet on his current girlfriend — but he ca n’t resist texting back , one hand ( thankfully ) still on the wheel , to inquire what she has in mind .
He passes her reply over for my perusal : “ I cd tell u but it would be much easier to show u ! ”
Later , while Pistorius is parking his little rocket at a coffee shop , I ask whether sometimes , maybe if he ’s in a huge hurry , he ever parks in handicap spaces .
“ Yoh !
Never , ” he almost spits .
“ There ’s nothing that cheeses me off worse than seeing somebody pull into a disabled spot , then get out of their car and walk off .
“ People ask me all the time if I wish I had the rest of my legs , ” Pistorius continues .
“ No .
I guess it ’s a kind of an inconvenience , having to put on different legs to do different things , but there ’s nothing that anyone else can do that I ca n’t do . ”
Sometimes his managers and coaches wish Pistorius would do a little less .
Last spring his then–business manager Lizl Schutte chewed him out when she learned he ’d spent the weekend on an ATV bike , competing with friends to see who could launch themselves the farthest off a ramp into a lake .
Steven Ball , his strength trainer , reports that although Pistorius has been destroying Paralympics records for two years , he began a hardcore weight training program only a year ago .
Ampie Louw , Pistorius ’ running coach since 2003 , says the biggest thing standing between the sprinter and the two seconds he needs to cut from his time in the 400 meters to make the Olympics may be his robust social life .
“ Getting him to come here and train every day — that ’s the challenge , ” Louw says with a rueful laugh .
“ Look at the best sprinters ’ upper bodies , and look at Oscar’s .
We ’re not matching the Asafa Powells yet . ”
Two seconds is about 5 percent of a world - class time in the 400 , no small improvement for Pistorius .
But Louw is convinced he can do it .
Since 2004
Pistorius has trimmed more than three seconds off his time in the 400 , and Louw is still working to correct a persistent problem in his running mechanics .
“ He always wants to make his stride too long , ” Louw says .
“ It puts enormous pressure on his hamstrings , and he spends too much time in the air . ”
A new pair of Cheetahs , specially designed for use by double amputees , might also help .
At the track for a workout , Pistorius opens the hatch of his car and takes out the new legs .
The South African flag is emblazoned on the sockets that grip Pistorius ’ stumps ; there ’s a line of 2 - inch - high foam - rubber pyramids down the rear face of the blades with a plastic wire connecting the points .
Pistorius says he and Trevor Brauckmann , the man who builds and fits those sockets , are going to stretch fabric across the framework in an attempt to cut down wind resistance — in other words , he ’s going to add aerodynamic cowling .
Just another enhancement .
A company called Flex - Foot debuted the Cheetah in 1996 , but the prosthetic blades remained a bit crude until Flex - Foot was acquired by the Icelandic firm Ossur in 2000 .
If you are missing a leg , owning an Ossur is like driving a BMW M - series .
The current Cheetahs look a little like the rear leg of a horse or cat , extending straight down from the socket , cantilevering backward , and then angling forward sharply .
But last September , Pistorius and Brauckmann went to Reykjavik to test prototypes designed for double amputees .
The new ones , which Pistorius has n’t debuted at a major race yet , make just one smooth curve , an arc of pure engineering .
Ossur ’s R&D team met them at the company ’s workshop and unveiled the prototypes .
Brauckmann attached the blades to the sockets , and Pistorius walked around on them , testing the design .
They were too soft , Brauckmann told Ari Clausen , an engineer at Ossur .
Oscar would to break them .
Clausen did n’t believe it .
His team had factored in every force Pistorius could possibly apply to the carbon fiber .
So the next day , Pistorius put them on , jogged a bit , and cracked them .
Clausen built a new set ; that afternoon he took the South Africans to a track to try out the replacements —
Brauckmann had doubts about the new pair as well , but Pistorius wanted to give them a try .
He strapped in , stretched a bit , and started to jog .
When Pistorius falls while running , it ’s less like a stumble and more like a skiing wipeout .
A few months before the Reykjavik trip , at a training day in South Africa , one of his blades split with a sound like a snapping two - by - four .
He hit the rubber track going about 25 miles an hour , and bounced and slid 10 yards before stopping .
He did n’t break any bones , but the road burn took weeks to heal .
This time , as Pistorius started running he heard some creaking noises from his right leg — something felt wrong .
Sure enough , the blade splintered .
But this time Pistorius was able to pull up and slow down .
He avoided the fall and hopped back to a chagrined Clausen , who tossed the prototypes into his huge tundra - and - magma - field - crawling Dodge Ram pickup and headed back to the workshop .
The testing room at Ossur is a bustling space where titanium - jointed prosthetic legs are stacked under racks of silicone feet and hands in various skin tones .
It looks like Geppetto ’s workshop , if Geppetto were building an army of life - size super puppets .
On my first look around , I see a guy sitting at a workbench , tightening screws that attach a prosthetic foot to a computer - controlled bionic knee called the Rheo .
It ’s a joint project between Ossur and the MIT Media Lab .
The man swivels in his chair , fastens the bionic leg to the stump of his left leg , stands up , and walks out of the room .
I catch up to him on his way back after he ’s tried out his tweaked Rheo on a set of stairs .
His name is Gísli Jónsson ; he ’s a technician at Ossur .
What ’s the best thing about the Rheo ?
I ask .
“ I do n’t fall down anymore , ” Jónsson says .
“ Even after I ’ve been drinking . ”
Pistorius ’
Cheetah blades are n’t particularly well - suited for a night of debauchery , and they do n’t have any of the sophisticated electronics software or servos of a Rheo .
They are purpose - built , starting their life at Ossur as rolls of resin-impregnated ( or “ pre-preg ” ) carbon fiber , stored in a van - sized industrial freezer .
The rolls are cut into square sheets and pressed onto the outside of a steel mold milled in the shape of the legs ’ final profile .
Depending on the size of the athlete the blades are being made for , anywhere from 30 to 90 carbon - fiber sheets are layered one on top of another .
Then the whole thing is swung into an autoclave that melts and fuses the resin and sheets into a solid , contoured carbon - fiber plate .
Using pre-preg sheets instead of adding resin cuts down on air bubbles that can cause breaks .
Once the compound cools , a robotic arm with a high - pressure water jet on the end carves the now - curved sheet into several Cheetah legs .
Each one costs between $ 15,000 and $ 18,000 .
To give me a sense of how they feel , Ossur ’s engineers bolt a pair of Cheetahs to the back of two rigid plastic - and - leather motorcycle boots .
I clamp in and trot across the room a few times .
The Cheetahs seem to bounce of their own accord .
It ’s impossible to stand still on them , and difficult to move slowly .
Once they get going , Cheetahs are extremely hard to control .
It should n’t come as any surprise that the most highly functional prosthetic limbs come from Iceland .
It ’s not a culture that embraces self - pity or , as far as I could tell from my week in Reykjavik , any pity at all .
Iceland has just begun killing whales again after a 20 - year hiatus , and nearly every Icelander I talk to is mystified by the international condemnation aimed at their tiny country .
Mothers sit in Reykjavik ’s restaurants devouring smoked puffin , casting occasional glances through the window at their heavily swaddled babies in carriages parked on the sidewalk in the cold wind .
There ’s a word in Icelandic : upphafning .
Literally it means “ elevation , ” but when the folks at Ossur use it , it ’s more like “ self - elevation . ”
Cutting slack to someone who ’s disabled is frowned upon here — pity is just condescension by another name .
Pistorius says he would n’t change a thing about his life — he ’s a world - class athlete and bona fide celebrity in South Africa who gets pestered for autographs and ogled by girls .
Just one problem : Pistorius wishes that his carbon - fiber prostheses were beside the point .
That ’s not likely .
They ’ll be precisely the point when the world ’s best able - bodied sprinters start losing heats to a bilateral lower - leg amputee .
If only because of their shape , the Cheetahs , especially when they are lined up at the starting blocks next to seven pairs of biological legs , elicit amazement and fear .
They look dangerous .
Bionic legs !
Part man , part machine !
The twin ghosts of Steve Austin and John Henry ( well , not twins exactly , but you see what I mean ) will always dog Pistorius .
Eventually , sports fans might be made to comprehend the distinction between bionics — mechanical joints with moving parts , microprocessors , and power sources — and what Pistorius runs on : pegs .
Hyper -engineered , autoclave - forged , epoxy - impregnated , elastic pegs , but still really just pegs .
But even that recognition might not be enough to quell concerns that Cheetahs confer an advantage .
After he blew past them in Athens , Americans Shirley and Frasure accused Pistorius of “ running tall ” : adding length to his stride by using longer prosthetics .
“ He ’s able to manipulate something that ’s out of other athletes ’ control , ” Shirley told Sports Illustrated .
“ Just because he has a double amputation , why should he have a different set of rules ? ”
It was a spurious accusation ; both men are , like Pistorius , sponsored by Ossur .
They know , or ought to know , that Cheetahs have to be longer than biological legs .
Nature built the ankle as a hinge that compresses and extends with every step , but Cheetahs supplant that localized up - and - down movement with elastic compression along their entire curve ... which means Cheetah users are permanently on tiptoe .
Perhaps more important , the limits of the human body — any human body — are a matter of math .
It takes 3,556 joules to move 80.5 kilograms , Pistorius ’ weight , at 9.4 meters per second .
That ’s his average speed on his fastest 200 - meter run .
Those joules have to come from somewhere .
Running is basically a matter of forcing that power into the legs and using them , springlike , to bounce the body forward .
The lower legs of able - bodied sprinters return all the energy pumped into them by the muscles at the hips and knees — and they give back more , thanks to power from the calves and ankles .
Pistorius does n’t have feet , ankles , or calves , of course , so he compensates :
His strength trainer estimates that 85 percent of his power comes from his hips and the rest comes from the knees .
That hip - generated stride , combined with the odd shape of the Cheetah itself , means that Pistorius has to waddle slightly , his feet flailing out to the side a bit on each rearward kick .
The blades make that scissoring noise as they grip the track , compress , and return to their original shape .
Pistorius ’ street legs are modeled and painted to look as much like natural legs as possible , color - matched to his thighs .
But covered by the flesh - tone paint is a doodled - on depiction of calf muscle a friend inked in red and black permanent marker before the Athens Paralympics .
It ’s an interesting tattoo , a reminder that no matter how good Cheetahs are , Pistorius is still missing a natural calf .
So , sure , artificial legs are lighter than natural ones .
Pistorius will never blow out his ankles or break a toe , though presumably his knees are as vulnerable as anyone ’s to old age and trauma .
But does any of that constitute an unfair advantage ?
Does being able to modify and tune a prosthetic limb belong to the same category as blood doping ( banned ) or altitude training ( A - OK ) ?
If there ’s an issue of fairness here at all , it ’s not that Pistorius is using technology superior to what evolution has built for human beings .
As Robert Gailey , who studies the biomechanics of prosthetics at the University of Miami , puts it , running on stilts is n’t exactly a plus .
The real asymmetry is that Frasure and Shirley each still have one natural leg , and it ’s holding them back .
You can see it when they run .
Mixed - leg sprinters piston up and down , energy lost to vertical movement when they ’re trying to go horizontal .
When Pistorius runs , his gait has a circular smoothness .
He looks like he ’s on wheels .
( Watch Pistorius run at wired.com / extras . )
And while runners lose speed coming out of a turn as they straighten up , Louw thinks that Pistorius may actually be able to use that inward lean to push more energy into the Cheetahs .
He ’d come out of a turn going faster .
Sitting in the stands overlooking the track in Pretoria , Pistorius admits to some of his shortcomings as a runner .
The 100 - meter will never be his event :
It takes him too long to get the right rhythm going , and the top single - amputee sprinters ( not to mention the able - bodied ones ) will probably continue to beat him .
No , for Pistorius it ’ll be the 200 and the 400 .
The first 30 meters , he says , are all about keeping his head down and taking short , quick strides .
Then he upshifts , breaking each curve into three straight lines and hitting the afterburners in the stretch .
He points to the stride patterns of Michael Johnson , the drug - enhanced sprinter ’s physique of Tim Montgomery , and the all - around greatness of current champ Asafa Powell .
All the people he wants to emulate are able - bodied .
“ I have full respect for the Paralympics , ” Pistorius says .
“ But I tell people this all the time : You ’ll never progress if your mind is on your disability . ”
But he ’s a Paralympic champion , I say .
“ I ’d really like to dominate the Paralympics until the end of my career , ” he answers .
“ But in able - bodied racing , I ’d like to be a known name for a long time . ”
In November , John Einmahl and Jan Magnus , econometrics professors at the Netherlands ’ Tilburg University , released an article called “ Records in Athletics Through Extreme - Value Theory . ”
In the paper — which has n’t been accepted for publication yet — they apply probability theory to the peak performances of thousands of athletes over time in 14 track and field events to determine the extreme values , or the limits , of athletic capability .
In some events , their models showed that current world records are fairly close to the limits .
They model the fastest - possible men ’s marathon time as 2:04:06 , only 49 seconds , or 0.7 percent , faster than the current world record .
In other events , the models predict a major improvement — the limit to the men ’s 100 meters is 9.29 seconds , they say , and the current world record is a dawdling 9.77 , a difference of 5 percent .
True , sports statisticians are always drawing graphs like this .
Charts of world - record performances do indeed tend to look asymptotic , forever approaching but never reaching some theoretical limit .
But the curve of records laid down by Paralympic athletes , Pistorius in particular , is approaching the limit line much more rapidly and at a much steeper angle .
The average track and field world record for able - bodied athletes is nine years old for men and 10 for women ; in Paralympics track and field events , that number is just two years .
Every time amputee jocks get together for a major meet , they break half of the world records on their books .
It ’s also true that the Cheetahs Pistorius hopes to run on in Beijing , with their pure - engineering swoop , are in quantifiable ways better — faster — than the ones he ran on in Athens .
Does that bother you ?
Pistorius ’ handlers have a saying :
If you think having carbon - fiber legs will make you a faster sprinter , have the operation and we ’ll see you at the track .
In their eyes , Cheetahs — for all their sophistication — are a disadvantage that Pistorius has transcended .
The International Association of Athletics Federations is supposed to decide if Pistorius is eligible for the Olympics this spring .
The possibilities :
If Pistorius is a black swan , a statistical freak who would have been a world - class sprinter on natural legs , too , then no problem — let him run .
And , if being an amputee is what gave Pistorius something to prove and turned him into a world - class sprinter , then no problem — let him run .
But if he is the vanguard of a legion of plastic track - and - field terminators whose upper speed is a function of materials science and software instead of determination and training ?
The International Olympics Commission better start hiring some engineers .
Back at the track , Pistorius scissors around a turn , halfway through half a dozen 300 - meter reps .
Louw whistles through two fingers and barks at the runner to shorten his strides .
Pistorius does n’t seem to hear .
He accelerates , muscles and carbon fiber reaching in unison toward a point just beyond the finish line .

In the Fall of 1958 , I became Assistant Professor of Communication Sciences ( in the EE Department ) at M.I.T. , and Marvin Minsky ( then an assistant professor in the Mathematics Department ) and I started the M.I.T. Artificial Intelligence Project .
The Project was supported by the M.I.T. Research Laboratory of Electronics which had a contract from the armed services that permitted great freedom to the Director , Professor Jerome Wiesner , in initiating new projects that seemed to him of scientific interest .
No written proposal was ever made .
When Wiesner asked Minsky and me what we needed for the project , we asked for a room , two programmers , a secretary and a keypunch , and he asked us to also undertake the supervision of some of the six mathematics graduate students that R.L.E. had undertaken to support .
The implementation of LISP began in Fall 1958 .
The original idea was to produce a compiler , but this was considered a major undertaking , and we needed some experimenting in order to get good conventions for subroutine linking , stack handling and erasure .
Therefore , we started by hand - compiling various functions into assembly language and writing subroutines to provide a LISP " environment " .
These included programs to read and print list structure .
I can't now remember whether the decision to use parenthesized list notation as the external form of LISP data was made then or whether it had already been used in discussing the paper differentiation program .
The programs to be hand - compiled were written in an informal notation called M-expressions intended to resemble FORTRAN as much as possible .
Besides FORTRAN - like assignment statements and go tos , the language allowed conditional expressions and the basic functions of LISP .
Allowing recursive function definitions required no new notation from the function definitions allowed in FORTRAN I - only the removal of the restriction - as I recall , unstated in the FORTRAN manual - forbidding recursive definitions .
The M-notation also used brackets instead of parentheses to enclose the arguments of functions in order to reserve parentheses for list - structure constants .
It was intended to compile from some approximation to the M- notation , but the M- notation was never fully defined , because representing LISP functions by LISP lists became the dominant programming language when the interpreter later became available .
A machine readable M-notation would have required redefinition , because the pencil - and - paper M-notation used characters unavailable on the IBM 026 key punch .
The READ and PRINT programs induced a de facto standard external notation for symbolic information , e.g. representing x +
3y + z by ( PLUS X ( TIMES 3 Y ) Z ) and by ( ALL ( X ) ( OR ( P X ) ( Q X Y ) ) ) .
Any other notation necessarily requires special programming , because standard mathematical notations treat different operators in syntactically different ways .
This notation later came to be called ``Cambridge Polish '' , because it resembled the prefix notation of Lukasiewicz , and because we noticed that Quine had also used a parenthesized prefix notation .
The erasure problem also had to be considered , and it was clearly unaesthetic to use explicit erasure as did IPL .
There were two alternatives .
The first was to erase the old contents of a program variable whenever it was updated .
Since the car and cdr operations were not to copy structure , merging list structure would occur , and erasure would require a system of reference counts .
Since there were only six bits left in a word , and these were in separated parts of the word , reference counts seemed infeasible without a drastic change in the way list structures were represented .
( A list handling scheme using reference counts was later used by Collins ( 1960 ) on a 48 bit CDC computer ) .
The second alternative is garbage collection in which storage is abandoned until the free storage list is exhausted , the storage accessible from program variables and the stack is marked , and the unmarked storage is made into a new free storage list .
Once we decided on garbage collection , its actual implementation could be postponed , because only toy examples were being done .
At that time it was also decided to use SAVE and UNSAVE routines that use a single contiguous public stack array to save the values of variables and subroutine return addresses in the implementation of recursive subroutines .
IPL built stacks as list structure and their use had to be explicitly programmed .
Another decision was to give up the prefix and tag parts of the word , to abandon cwr , and to make cons a function of two arguments .
This left us with only a single type - the 15 bit address - so that the language did n't require declarations .
These simplifications made LISP into a way of describing computable functions much neater than the Turing machines or the general recursive definitions used in recursive function theory .
The fact that Turing machines constitute an awkward programming language does n't much bother recursive function theorists , because they almost never have any reason to write particular recursive definitions , since the theory concerns recursive functions in general .
They often have reason to prove that recursive functions with specific properties exist , but this can be done by an informal argument without having to write them down explicitly .
In the early days of computing , some people developed programming languages based on Turing machines ; perhaps it seemed more scientific .
Anyway , I decided to write a paper describing LISP both as a programming language and as a formalism for doing recursive function theory .
The paper was Recursive functions of symbolic expressions and their computation by machine , part I ( McCarthy 1960 ) .
Part II was never written but was intended to contain applications to computing with algebraic expressions .
The paper had no influence on recursive function theorists , because it did n't address the questions that interested them .
One mathematical consideration that influenced LISP was to express programs as applicative expressions built up from variables and constants using functions .
I considered it important to make these expressions obey the usual mathematical laws allowing replacement of expressions by expressions giving the same value .
The motive was to allow proofs of properties of programs using ordinary mathematical methods .
This is only possible to the extent that side - effects can be avoided .
Unfortunately , side - effects are often a great convenience when computational efficiency is important , and ``functions ' ' with side - effects are present in LISP .
However , the so - called pure LISP is free of side - effects , and ( Cartwright 1976 ) and ( Cartwright and McCarthy 1978 ) show how to represent pure LISP programs by sentences and schemata in first order logic and prove their properties .
This is an additional vindication of the striving for mathematical neatness , because it is now easier to prove that pure LISP programs meet their specifications than it is for any other programming language in extensive use .
( Fans of other programming languages are challenged to write a program to concatenate lists and prove that the operation is associative ) .
Another way to show that LISP was neater than Turing machines was to write a universal LISP function and show that it is briefer and more comprehensible than the description of a universal Turing machine .
This was the LISP function eval [ e , a ] , which computes the value of a LISP expression e - the second argument a being a list of assignments of values to variables .
( a is needed to make the recursion work ) .
Writing eval required inventing a notation representing LISP functions as LISP data , and such a notation was devised for the purposes of the paper with no thought that it would be used to express LISP programs in practice .
Logical completeness required that the notation used to express functions used as functional arguments be extended to provide for recursive functions , and the LABEL notation was invented by Nathaniel Rochester for that purpose .
D.M.R.
Park pointed out that LABEL was logically unnecessary since the result could be achieved using only LAMBDA - by a construction analogous to Church 's Y - operator , albeit in a more complicated way .
S.R. Russell noticed that eval could serve as an interpreter for LISP , promptly hand coded it , and we now had a programming language with an interpreter .
The unexpected appearance of an interpreter tended to freeze the form of the language , and some of the decisions made rather lightheartedly for the ``Recursive functions ...'' paper later proved unfortunate .
These included the COND notation for conditional expressions which leads to an unnecessary depth of parentheses , and the use of the number zero to denote the empty list NIL and the truth value false .
Besides encouraging pornographic programming , giving a special interpretation to the address 0 has caused difficulties in all subsequent implementations .
Another reason for the initial acceptance of awkwardnesses in the internal form of LISP is that we still expected to switch to writing programs as M-expressions .
The project of defining M-expressions precisely and compiling them or at least translating them into S - expressions was neither finalized nor explicitly abandoned .
It just receded into the indefinite future , and a new generation of programmers appeared who preferred internal notation to any FORTRAN - like or ALGOL - like notation that could be devised .

During my 23 years with The Times ’ sports department , I have held a wide variety of roles and titles .
Tennis writer .
Angels beat reporter .
Olympics writer .
Essayist .
Sports media critic .
NFL columnist .
Recent keeper of the Morning Briefing flame .
Today I leave for a few weeks ’ vacation , and when I return , I will come back in yet another incarnation .
As Christine .
I am a transsexual sportswriter .
It has taken more than 40 years , a million tears and hundreds of hours of soul - wrenching therapy for me to work up the courage to type those words .
I realize many readers and colleagues and friends will be shocked to read them .
That ’s OK .
I understand that I am not the only one in transition as I move from Mike to Christine .
Everyone who knows me and my work will be transitioning as well .
That will take time .
And that ’s all right .
To borrow a piece of well - worn sports parlance , we will take it one day at a time .
Transsexualism is a complicated and widely misunderstood medical condition .
It is a natural occurrence — unusual , no question , but natural .
Recent studies have shown that such physiological factors as genetics and hormonal fluctuations during pregnancy can significantly affect how our brains are “ wired ” at birth .
As extensive therapy and testing have confirmed , my brain was wired female .
A transgender friend provided the best and simplest explanation I have heard :
We are born with this , we fight it as long as we can , and in the end it wins .
I gave it as good a fight as I possibly could .
I went more than 40 hard rounds with it .
Eventually , though , you realize you are only fighting yourself and your happiness and your mental health — a no -win situation any way you look at it .
When you reach the point when one gender causes heartache and unbearable discomfort , and the other brings more joy and fulfillment than you ever imagined possible , it should n’t take two tons of bricks to fall in order to know what to do .
It did n’t with me .
With me , all it took was 1.99 tons .
For more years than I care to count , I was scared to death over the prospect of writing a story such as this one .
It was the most frightening of all the towering mountains of fear I somehow had to confront and struggle to scale .
How do you go about sharing your most important truth , one you spent a lifetime trying to keep deeply buried , to a world that has grown familiar and comfortable with your façade ?
To a world whose knowledge of transsexuals usually begins and ends with Jerry Springer ’s exploitation circus ?
Painfully and reluctantly , I began the coming - out process a few months ago .
To my everlasting amazement , friends and colleagues almost universally have been supportive and encouraging , often breaking the tension with good - natured doses of humor .
When I told my boss Randy Harvey , he leaned back in his chair , looked through his office window to scan the newsroom and mused , “ Well , no one can ever say we do n’t have diversity on this staff . ”
When I told Robert , the soccer - loving lad from Wales who cuts my hair , why I wanted to start growing my hair out , he had to take a seat , blink hard a few times and ask , “ Does this mean you do n’t like football anymore , Mike ? ”
No , I had to assure him , I still love soccer .
I will continue to watch it .
I hope to continue to coach it .
My days of playing in men ’s over - 30 rec leagues , however , could be numbered .
When I told Eric , who has played sweeper behind my plodding stopper for more than a decade , he brightly suggested , “ Well , you ’re still good for co-ed ! ”
I broke the news to Tim by beginning , “ Are you familiar with the movie ‘ Transamerica ’ ? ”
Tim nodded .
“ Well , welcome to my life , ” I said .
Tim seemed more perplexed than most as I nervously launched into my story .
Finally , he had to explain , “ I thought you said ‘ Trainspotting . ’
I thought you were going to tell me you ’re a heroin addict . ”
People have asked if transitioning will affect my writing .
And if so , how ?
All I can say at this point is that I am now happier , more focused and more energized when I sit behind a keyboard .
The wicked writer ’s block that used to reach up and torture me at some of the worst possible times imaginable has disappeared .
My therapist says this is what happens when a transsexual finally “ integrates ” and the ever - present white noise in the background dissipates .
That should come as good news to my editors : far fewer blown deadlines .
So now we all will take a short break between bylines .
“ Mike Penner ” is out , “ Christine Daniels ” soon will be taking its place .
From here , it feels like a big improvement .
I hope with time you will agree .
This could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship .

Abstract
Many studies have shown that multinational firms pay more than domestic firms in Third World countries .
Economists critical of sweatshops have responded that multinational firms  wage data do not address whether sweatshop jobs are above average because many of these jobs are with domestic subcontractors .
In this paper we compare apparel industry wages and the wages of individual firms accused of being sweatshops to measures of the standard of living in Third World economies .
We find that most sweatshop jobs provide an above average standard of living for their workers .
Over the past decade U.S. firms and their subcontractors have faced protests from student groups , labor leaders , and some government officials for employing sweatshop labor .
Sweatshops are generally characterized as places of employment that have low pay , poor working conditions , and long hours .
Most economists view so - called sweatshops as a benefit to Third World workers and recognize that the anti-sweatshop activists  activities could reduce Third World employment and investment , thus making workers worse off .
In response to the anti-sweatshop movement , economists in the Academic Consortium on International Trade ( ACIT ) , led by Jagdish Bhagwati , circulated a letter to colleges and universities urging them to become aware of the downsides to anti-sweatshop movement demands before adopting any policies .
The economic way of thinking views sweatshops from an exchange perspective in which both workers and employers gain when they voluntarily enter into a labor contract no matter how low the wages may seem to external observers .
From Walter Williams ( 2004 ) on the right to Paul Krugman ( 1997 ) on the left , economists across the political spectrum have defended sweatshops in the popular press .
[ 1 ]
One economist critical of sweatshops even observed that most economists  opinion is as simple as this :  Either you believe labor demand curves are downward sloping , or you dont ,  as a neoclassical colleague said to me .
Of course , not to believe that demand curves are negatively sloped would be tantamount to declaring yourself an economic illiterate ( Miller 2003 ) .
Not all economists support sweatshops , however .
In response to the letter circulated by ACIT , a group calling themselves Scholars Against Sweatshop Labor ( SASL ) circulated their own letter in support of the student anti-sweatshop movement .
The letter had 434 signatories , 73 percent of whom were economists .
At least one scholarly article by an economist , ( Miller 2003 )  Why Economists are Wrong About Sweatshops ,  has criticized the mainstream economic view of sweatshops .
Much of the scholarly work on sweatshops has been performed by non-economists or has limited itself to documenting the organization and activities of the anti-sweatshop movement .
Examples include Mandle ( 2000 ) , Appelbaum and Dreier ( 1999 ) , and Firoz and Ammaturo ( 2002 ) .
Only a few economic papers have dealt directly with sweatshops .
Brown , Deardorff , and Stern ( 2003 ) modeled the theoretic frameworks in which multinational firms could raise or lower wages .
Elliot and Freeman ( 2001 ) outlined the most harmful of the anti-sweatshop activists  demands .
Moran ( 2002 Ch. 1 and 2 ) documents that foreign direct investment and the firms it encourages provide above average pay and benefits for Third World workers .
Most scholarly work by economists related to sweatshops has focused on the wages multinational firms pay .
Several econometric studies demonstrate the benefits multinational firms provide .
Aitken , Harrison , and Lipsey ( 1996 ) and Lipsey and Sjoholm ( 2001 ) both find that after controlling for other factors , multinational firms pay higher wages than domestic firms in Third World countries .
Feenstra and Hanson ( 1997 ) find that multinational firms improve the lives of workers by increasing the demand for labor .
Budd and Slaughter ( 2000 ) and Budd , Konings , and Slaughter ( 2001 ) find that as multinational profits go up , multinational firms share gains with Third World workers .
Brown , Deardorff and Stern ( 2003 ) summarize the literature documenting the benefits multinational companies provide to Third World workers .
Economists critical of sweatshops usually do not dispute that multinational firms pay more than domestic firms in most cases .
Miller ( 2003 ) notes ,
The ACIT writes that multinational corporations commonly pay their workers more on average in comparison to the prevailing market wage for similar workers employed elsewhere in the economy .
But , as the SASL authors correctly point out ,  While this is true , it does not speak to the situation in which most garments are produced throughout the world which is by firms subcontracted by multinational corporations , not the MNCs themselves ( p.101 ) .
This paper expands on the existing literature by comparing sweatshop wages , without regard to whether a firm is multinational or a domestic subcontractor of such , to standards of living in the countries in which they employ workers .
We compiled a list of countries where U.S. news sources have reported sweatshops .
The apparel industry is widely cited in the press for using sweatshops most frequently , so apparel industry wages in these countries are compared to average income , average wages and poverty earnings , in the next section of this paper .
In the third section we compare the wages at individual firms accused of being sweatshops with these same standard of living measures .
Apparel Jobs Compared to Average Living Standards
The apparel industry has drawn the most attention the press for its use of sweatshop labor .
Sometimes a U.S. firm directly employs Third World workers , but more often subcontractors actually produce the products .
Table 1 contains the average apparel industry wages in countries where sweatshops supposedly exist . [ 2 ]
Apparel industry wages are low by U.S. standards , but they compare favorably with the average standard of living in these countries .
Figure 1 shows the average apparel workers earnings as a percent of average per capita income .
Since no data documenting the average number of hours worked in the apparel industry were available , we provide four estimates that vary the hours worked per week between 40 and 70 .
The 60 and 70 hour estimates are more likely to be accurate since these employees often work long hours and six days per week .
Figure 1 shows that if working 70 hours per week , apparel workers  average income exceeds the average income in each country .
[ 3 ]
In 9 of 10 nations , average apparel industry income exceeds the national average at only 50 hours per week .
Apparel workers in the Dominican Republic , Haiti , Honduras , and Nicaragua earn 3 to 7 times the national average .
National income per capita divides the total output of the economy by the total population , both workers and non-workers .
If apparel industry workers tend to be young and without a family , or women and children , then comparing apparel wages to average income per capita gives a fairly accurate assessment of how they live compared to others in their economy since their income is only supporting one person .
Women and children were often the workers in 19th century U.S. and British sweatshops , and some anecdotal evidence from the Third World suggests this may be true there too .
It is also useful to compare apparel industry workers  earnings to just other workers wages .
Unfortunately , good wage data does not exist .
To approximate average wage data , we have used employment participation data to adjust average income per capita to reflect average income per worker .
Data on labor force size do not count workers in the informal sector , which can be quite large in these countries , but the value of what informal workers produce is often estimated in GDP measures .
[ 4 ]
Accordingly , our measure of earnings per worker likely overstates average income per worker and thus causes us to understate apparel industry wages as a percent of average income per worker .
Figure 2 shows that despite this bias , average apparel industry wages equal or exceed average income per worker in 8 of 10 countries .
At 70 hours of work per week , apparel worker earnings in six countries exceed 150 percent of average income per worker , and they more than double the average in three countries .
We can also compare apparel industry earnings to the dire poverty in these countries .
Table 2 reports the World Banks estimated percent of the population that lives on less than $ 1 and $ 2 per day .
In most of these countries more than half the population lives on less than $ 2 per day .
Yet , in 9 of 10 countries , working 10 hour days in the apparel industry lifts employees above ( and often far above ) the $ 2 per day threshold .
Even in the one exception , Bangladesh , working 10 hour days in the apparel industry results in earning more than the 36 % of the population living on less than $ 1 per day .
The apparel industry has been widely criticized for exploiting 
Third World workers in sweatshops , but the data show that these workers are better off than most people in their countries .
Although the apparel industry as a whole pays better , anti-sweatshop activists sometimes single out particular firms as exploitative .
We next look at examples in which specific firms have been protested for being sweatshops .
Wages in Sweatshop Firms Compared to Living Standards
Our data come from popular press articles that document sweatshop wages .
[ 5 ]
Many of the wages quoted come directly from anti-sweatshop activists .
Thus , any bias would understate the actual level of compensation . [ 6 ]
Despite this , we find that when compared to per capita income in these countries , most sweatshops pay more than the average standard of living .
Table 3 lists the wages that sweatshop workers reportedly earn and , when available , the company involved .
These wages are obviously quite low compared to those in the U.S. , but a high percentage of people in these countries earn less than $ 1 or $ 2 per day .
In 41 of 43 cases , working 10 hour days results in earning more than $ 1 per day , and in more than half the earnings are greater than $ 2 per day .
Sweatshop wages raise workers  standard of living higher than a significant fraction of the population .
Figure 3 shows average reported sweatshop wages as a percent of each countrys average income . [ 7 ]
Since many news articles contained hourly wage data without stating the number of hours worked , we again created four estimates that vary hours worked per week between 40 and 70 .
When articles reported daily wage data , we based our calculation on six days of work per week .
The 40 hour estimate is probably low again since most sweatshop employees work long hours and often work six days per week .
When articles provided estimated hours of work , most were in excess of 70 per week ; we included the actual hours in the 70 hour estimate when they were available .
In 9 of 11 countries , the reported sweatshop wages equal or exceed average income , doubling it in Cambodia , Haiti , Nicaragua , and Honduras ( at 70 hours ) .
However , these figures do not include non-monetary compensation .
Nikes employees in Indonesia , for example , receive free health care and meals in addition to their wages ( Jones 1996 ) .
Since 7 of 8 Indonesian examples alleged Nike factories to be sweatshops , not including non-monetary compensation causes our Indonesian sweatshop wage estimates to appear far lower than they should .
If firms in other countries also provide additional benefits , their wages may be similarly understated .
Overall , even with our data limitations , Figure 3 demonstrates that most of the jobs that some anti-sweatshop advocates protest raise their workers  standard of living above their nations average .
The above figure compares sweatshop wages with average income for both workers and non-workers .
We can again make the adjustment , with the same data limitations as before , to compare protested sweatshop jobs with average income per worker .
Due to not counting the large informal sector , we are again likely understating sweatshop earnings as a percent of average earnings per worker .
The bias that our data often come directly from those with the most incentive to understate earnings also remains .
Figure 4 shows that the average protested sweatshop worker earns more than the average worker in Cambodia , Haiti and Nicaragua .
In most countries the protested wages are more than 60 percent of the average .
It is important to remember the biases and limitations of this data when comparing these numbers .
In addition , the relevant comparison facing an individual worker is not average wages but individual alternatives .
Sweatshops make a worker better off when they pay more than that specific workers next best alternative .
Thus , even where earnings are less than 100 percent of average wages , as long as workers voluntarily choose to work at the sweatshop , it makes the individual worker better off .
Some caution should be used when looking at the data for China .
A few articles reported that the Chinese government " forced " people to work in sweatshops .
If this is true , then we cannot assume that the jobs make the workers better off .
Since the extent to which the Chinese examples were voluntary or coerced was unclear , we averaged them all .
As such , coerced labor may be causing their reported wages to be a lower percent of average income than other countries .
Conclusion
Few dispute that multinational firms tend to pay their workers more than domestic firms in the Third World .
Critics of sweatshops maintain that because subcontractors make many products for multinational firms , measuring only multinational firm wages does not address critics  complaints against sweatshops .
We have addressed the deficiency in the literature by comparing apparel industry wages in countries that supposedly have sweatshops and the wages of individual firms accused of being sweatshops to measures of average standards of living in these countries .
The data clearly show that overall , apparel industry workers are far better off than most people in their economies .
However , while the best available , the data used was far from perfect .
Biases are likely causing us to understate earnings as a percent of living standards .
Despite data limitations , individual firms accused of paying sweatshop wages often still compare favorably with other standard of living measures .

[ 1] Other excellent examples include Sowell ( 2004 ) and Henderson ( 2000 ) .
[ 2 ] Countries where at least one U.S. news source claimed sweatshops existed were included .

All data on average per capita income and labor force size used in Figures 1 - 4 come from the World Banks World Development Indicators Online , accessed July 2004 .
Conversions of per capita income from local currency to U.S. currency are made by the World Bank using the atlas method .
[ 4 ]
The common perception is that everybody works  in these countries , yet because much of the work is in agriculture or the informal sector , many workers are not counted in the official labor force participation numbers used here .

[ 6 ]
Each article converted domestic wages into U.S. prices without mentioning the exchange rate method used for conversion .
Two articles may quote different wages when referring to the same case because of different methods of conversion .
When we identified multiple articles referring to the same case , we included the individual sweatshop only once in our sample .
[ 7 ]
We compared each reported sweatshop wage with the average income in the year for which the wage was reported .
To compare average sweatshop earnings to average income for a country without biasing the results , we also averaged the per capita income data for each observation .
For example , if a country had two reported sweatshop cases in 1996 , one in 1997 and one in 2000 , we averaged those wages and compared to [ ( GNI 1996 ) +( GNI 1996 ) +( GNI 1997 ) +( GNI 2000 ) ] / 4

The BPS Research Digest has a wonderfully straightforward explanation of a branch of psychology called psychophysics , which attempts to understand the relation between physical qualities and the psychological impressions they cause .
The piece is written by Mind Hacks co-founder and psychophysicist extraordinaire , Dr Tom Stafford , who explains how this key area of psychology uses mathematical models to understand how the brain makes sense of the physical world .
Tom explains how psychophysics tackles these sorts of problems and then explains one of the most important discoveries in psychophysics :
Weber ’s law .
Psychophysics is heavily used in ergonomics and human - computer interaction .
Knowing , for example , how noticeable something is ( like a warning light ) , gives a huge advantage when trying to design safe and easy - to - use software interfaces , jet fighter cockpits or even home appliances .

In the past two weeks I ’ve had the opportunity to talk to both Marissa Mayer and Matt Cutts about the impact of personalization at Google .
While the initial storm following Google ’s announcement seems to be dying down somewhat , the ripple effects can still be felt throughout the SEM industry .
In future columns I ’ll probably be coming back to the personalization angle on a semi- regular basis because I really believe it ’s fundamentally important to the next evolution of search .
But in the next little while I ’ll probably move on to other topics .
Before I do move on , however , I did want to take a look at some of the criticism that has come out about personalization and provide my view on why personalization is the logical next step for search .
Crying wolf about personalization
To be honest , I ’m surprised at the amount of push back to search engine personalization .
One of the biggest dissenters of personal search is Michael Gray .
Both on his own blog and various comments posted on other blogs , he ’s been a consistent critic of Google ’s move towards personalization .
Here ’s just a sample of Michael ’s arguments against personalization .
2+2 should always be 4 no matter where you are .
It should n’t be 3.7 because in Brazil they like things slimmer and lighter and it should n’t be 4.2 in Italy because they have an aversion for waifishly thin numbers .
It also should n’t be 3 for me because I ’ve demonstrated a dislike for the number 4 for based on prior search history , but really like the number 3 …
I think I get Michael ’s point here but I disagree with the context .
Two plus two equals four is a mathematically defined truth .
It ’s universal and unquestionable .
But search is all about disambiguating intent from a few words formulated in your mind .
There ’s no universality , because the intent is solely yours .
And that ’s the problem the search engines are currently facing .
For search to move to the next one level , disambiguation of individual intent is critical .
Semantic mapping primer
Anyone who ’s heard me speak in the past has probably heard me talk about the concept of semantic mapping .
For those of you who have n’t , here ’s a 30 second explanation :
When we launch a query on a search engine , we take a concept in our mind and try to distill it into a single query .
Concepts are usually complex things , made up of a number of aspects .
For example , let ’s say I ’m looking to replace my PDA .
There are probably brands of PDA ’s I ’m familiar with and features that are important to me .
I may be looking for independent reviews , and I may be looking for one that ’s compatible with one particular data network provider .
These and a number of other factors make up my concept .
The various aspects of this concept can probably be translated into words , creating a number of labels for my concept .
These words create a semantic map , a literal translation of my concept .
But the semantic map may contain dozens , or hundreds of words and I ’m certainly not going to take the time to type them all into a search engine .
Remember , our average interaction with the search engine is some somewhere under eight seconds .
So I distill this complex concept down into a single phrase .
That ’s all I give the search engine to work with .
The search engine ’s job is to take that single phrase and try to provide me with the results that most closely match my semantic map .
And now you see the problem that presents itself to the search engine .
How can it possibly know all the words that are in my semantic map ?
Matching the user ’s intent
One way is to make the user do the heavy lifting .
This could play out in a couple of different ways .
On search engines as we currently know them , it probably means an iterative searching process .
We try a phrase , see how close the matches are , and if we ’re not satisfied that we ’re getting the best match to our intent , we can continually tweak our phrases until the results look more relevant .
But this is a time - consuming process .
It is , however , the process we ’ve become used to and we feel like we ’re in control of it .
Another way the user could help the search engine disambiguate intent is though a new interface .
One interesting approach to this is the one used by Quintura .
If you want to see how semantic mapping looks in action take a look at Quintura ’s interface .
Quintura takes your original query and provides a semantic map based on the most likely matches to the phrase .
Example of Quintura “ Cloud ” for the query “ pda ”
You can click on words in the map and the query refines itself as you do so , narrowing the focus of the map so that it hopefully gets closer and closer to the concept in your head .
Again this can be a time - consuming process and puts a lot of the onus on the user , not the background technology .
Disambiguation in the background
Ultimately , search has to solve the problem in a more transparent way .
While there are some users who feel comfortable with putting the time in to refine their query and help the engine with the task of disambiguating intent , the majority of us do n’t want to make that big an investment .
The tool has to be much simpler and quicker to use .
So that brings us back to the question , how do engines disambiguating intent without us giving it any more information to work with at the point of query ?
This is where personalization comes in .
In the current online reality , there are really only a few places that the search engine can look to help define intent without depending on further information from the user :
They can look at your past history and learn more about you by what you have already done
They can look at the context of the task you ’re currently engaged in , hoping that it will give some clues to what you ’re looking for
And finally , if they know something about you and your social , geographic and demographic cohort , the engine can hope that there is a similarity of thinking within that cohort , at least when it comes to common interests and intent
Each of these factors is being explored as a potential avenue to help with disambiguating intent .
Right now , Google is put their eggs in the past online history basket , feeling that where you have been will provide the best signal to predict where you might want to go .
How the user wins with personalization
So how will personalization help the user experience ?
Try as I might , I could n’t think of any online examples where personalization was really well integrated with the user experience currently .
The best example I can come up with was Amazon ’s personalization engine and that is just scratching the surface of what ’s possible .
So I had to reach out to a real - world analogy to try to understand this better :
Imagine you had two alternatives when you went shopping .
One is a vast department store which carried everything you could possibly imagine .
The store is usually well organized and everything is well labeled , but it ’s up to you to navigate through the store and find what you ’re looking for .
There ’s no one to really help you , although there are a number of useful signs to keep you pointed in the right direction .
The other option small store ran by a store owner who you deal with all the time ; a store owner that knows you as a friend , knows your personal likes and dislikes and always seems to find just the right thing for you .
In fact , all you have to do is say what you ’re looking for in a few words , and based on how well he knows you , the store owner runs in the back and never fails to bring back exactly the right product , in the right size and the right color .
The first scenario describes where search is today .
The second scenario describes where search wants to go in the future .
As the scope of the Internet gets larger and larger , the need for personalization to bring it within our scope becomes more and more important .
Search had a tough enough job when it was just trying to connect us with websites .
Now it ’s trying to connect us with websites , local businesses , news sources , images , audio files , videos , and the list will continue to grow and grow .
Search has to move beyond its current paradigm of one query and a list of links to websites .
The challenge of disambiguation becomes exponentially harder as there are more potential matches with content .
You have to narrow the odds on one side of the equation or the other .
Search has no intention of restricting the focus of the content is indexing , so the only choice is to get better at determining intent with the user .
That ’s why personalization in some form is inevitable .
The user ’s sticking points with personalization
Another source of criticism is how personalization may impact the credibility of search results .
Once again a comment from Michael Gray :
Let ’s take personalized SERP ’s a bit farther , let ’s imagine we have something like digital books that can rewrite themselves based on user preferences .
Instead of Hermione Granger being a brown haired slightly bookish student at Hogwarts , she ’s a buxom blonde in a mini- skirt because I ’ve demonstrated a preference for that in the past .
For someone else she ’s a raven haired Gothic princess , for another she ’s more of a debutante prom queen .
Here , I ’m not sure the point that Michael is trying to get across .
We have a totally different level of engagement with the book we ’re reading than we do with the search engine .
Our interaction with the book can be several hours in duration .
Our interaction with any given search experience is probably a few seconds at most .
The last thing we wanted to do is get to know the “ character ” of the search engine results page .
Books depend on characters to carry the plot of the story .
There is no plot to a search engine results page .
It ’s simply a presentation of options to match our intent .
The overall integrity of the search engine results pages determined solely by its degree of relevancy to the user .
Anything that improves that degree of relevancy makes the search results that more useful to the user .
There ’s no artistic integrity to maintain .
But Michael is not the only critic .
Others worry about the potential impact of unknown algorithmic factors on the results that they could be seen on their search results page .
This was a comment on my blog from Adam .
The biggest risk I see in personalized search is latency .
When you return from your vacation , how long will it take before Google stops biasing results towards travel / Hawaii or perhaps thats a non-issue .
I equate this to the impact of buying a gift of a childrens book on Amazon — all your recommendations going forward are tainted with that purchase .
Another concern is the pain with signing in and signing out and how Google knows who is who ?
Okay , so I should log into my account , then when my wife wants to surf , she should log into her account .
Then , my kids should do the same .
Of course , I can just buy every one a computer .
The truth is , until this process of identifying users becomes nearly automatic , I do n’t see the Google method as adding a great deal of value .
Steve Haar , Editor – Think About Search
Am I signed in or not ?
With these two concerns , I think we are getting to the heart of where the potential problems from a user ’s point of view may lie .
What if our past online paths are n’t a good predictor of where we might go in the future ?
At this point Google is telling us that we always have the opportunity to toggle personalization off and on .
The one issue I have is that a number of users do n’t even know they ’re logged on , despite Google ’s claims that it ’s easy to see .
We just did an in - service session with a large client of ours where a couple members of our team met with a number of their client - side counterparts .
While there , they talked a little bit about the possible impact of personalization on the client ’s search visibility .
The client frankly did n’t see that it was going to be that much of an impact because , in their words , “ no one really signs into Google anyway , do they ? ”
Our team pointed out to them that they were , in fact , signed in and that their personal search history was being compiled with each search they did .
They were shocked to learn this .
In my conversation with Marissa Mayer she felt strongly that the indications on whether or not you were signed in were very clear to the user .
I do disagree here .
I know for a fact that once users become engaged with the task of searching , a look up in the upper right - hand corner to see if or not their e-mail address is showing is just not something that happens very often .
Every heat map we ’ve ever produced of the search results page shows virtually zero scanning up in this area .
So the fact is , for the majority of users who are signed in , they ’ll forget that they are signed in .
I ’m acutely aware of personalization and I often have to double check to see whether or not I ’m logged in when the results look little strange to me .
And if personalization does significantly improve the search experience , do we start developing split personalities where our at - home personas differ significantly from our at - work personas ?
Do we have to start keeping multiple profiles for Google ?
On multi-user computers , how does Google keep everyone straight ?
The last thing Google wants is to make signing in and signing a pain .
They would much prefer that everyone gets signed in and then forgets about it .
How fast do we go down the personalization path ?
Ironically , despite all the negative feedback , the biggest problem that Google is probably facing with personalization is not that it ’s going too far , too fast , but rather that it ’s not going far enough .
Google is addressing the above user concerns by treading very carefully down the path of personalization .
Right now , only one in five searches will be impacted by personalization and it will only lift two results into the top 10 .
In this way , it ’s really not a major impact for most of us on the majority of our searches .
Google ’s cautious approach is definitely showing here .
But for personalization to deliver the win that Google is banking on , it ’s going to have to play a much bigger role on the search results page .
Right now , personalization is only “ turned on ” by Google when there ’s existing search history .
So it ’s the searches where you tend to be in familiar territory where personalization will have its greatest impact .
This has a somewhat humorous side effect for the SEOs of the world , because we all tend to do those impromptu searches where we see either how we or our clients rank for certain phrases .
Of course , we also tend to click through whenever we see our site or our client site show up in the results .
This creates a pattern in our search history which will naturally boost the position of those listings we clicked on .
This results in the heady but temporary thrill of thinking that our clients have jumped dramatically in the rankings and are now showing in the top 10 .
Then we realize that we ’re logged into personalized search and it ’s our past search history that ’s given these sites the boost , not the Google algorithm .
But does n’t it make sense that personalization is most needed when we ’re not in familiar territory ?
Is n’t the challenge of disambiguating intent tougher when the concepts in our heads are fuzzier and not as well defined ?
To me that ’s where personalization could deliver the big win .
When it can help me explore territory that I ’m unfamiliar with more confidently and helps connect me to the sites I ’m looking for , personalization becomes a huge user win .
Personalization as its being currently implemented from Google will help most of us in the short term primarily with our navigational searches .
These are the searches where we can use Google as a shortcut to get to sites quickly .
In the past we may have had to scroll through a few pages of results to find the sites we ’re looking for , but now personalization will help lift those sites closer to the top .
Finally , probably my favorite dissenting posted comment was one where I was accused of the complete ignorance of Chaos Theory .
Guilty as charged .
One wonders where in the world people like Mr. Hotchkiss are coming from .
Chaos theory which Mr. Hotchkiss apparently sees as something unique to “ dissenters ” really is rather beside the point .
( Funny , I do n’t remember even mentioning Chaos Theory in any of my writings about search personalization )
It merely discloses that if Mr. Hotchkiss had a scintilla of knowledge about chaos theory as applied to information per se , he would understand that there is an inverse correlation between the uniformity and complexity of any system , including information systems , and the ability of such systems to produce reliable results .
Hmmm , I ’m not sure what he ’s saying but I do n’t think he ’s agreeing with me .
There ’s a lot of unrealized potential still to be found in personalization and Google freely admits this .
They realize that these are the first few steps on a long path towards a better user experience .
And with any implementation of change , there is always a degree of nervousness around that change .
Although the current paradigm of iterative searching where we use a query and refine it in order to get closer to the content we are looking for can be cumbersome and time - consuming in some cases , it does leave us in control .
And it ’s this lack of control that appears to be the biggest push back point against personalization .
Many of us are just not at a point where we can trust technology to be able to interpret us as individuals .
Be that as it may , I ’m not sure we ’ll have a choice .

セメントが金属に変身──電気を通さない絶縁体であるはずのセメントを、黒鉛の2倍以上という高い電気伝導を示す金属状態に変える“現代版錬金術”に成功したと、東京工業大学、大阪府立大学、理化学研究所、高輝度光科学研究センターが発表した。
テレビなどに使われる液晶ディスプレイには、透明かつ電気を通す「透明金属」が使われているが、材料として使われているインジウムは液晶生産量の拡大から将来の不足が心配されている。研究グループは「ナノ構造を利用し、身の回りにあるごくありふれた元素を使って透明金属を実現できる有望な道筋を与えた」としている。
成功したのは、東工大フロンティア創造共同研究センターの細野秀雄教授、大阪府大の久保田佳基准教授、理研の高田昌樹主任研究員らの共同グループ。成果は米国化学会発行の科学雑誌「 Nano Letters」に掲載される。
セメントの構成成分として使われている、石灰とアルミナで構成する化合物（C12A7）は、直径0.5ナノメートルという極小の「かご」が結びついて結晶を作っている。その中に酸素イオンが入っており、摂氏700度以上になると結晶中をよく動き回ることに着目。金属チタンと一緒にガラス管に封入し、1100度で加熱することで、酸素イオンをほぼ100％電子で置き換えることが可能になり、絶縁体を半導体、金属にまで変えることに成功した。
C12A7の半導体化には2003年に成功していた。金属化の成功で、今後は「セメント超電導体」の実現が目標だとしている。

It 's a race to the bottom .
No , I 'm not talking about daytime TV .
I 'm referring to the search for extrasolar planets , and the scramble to find smaller , daintier worlds .
Normally , when astronomers trumpet the discovery of yet another extrasolar planet , it 's nearly always a hulking , Homeric object ; Jupiter - sized or so .
That 's been as predictable as hair loss .
However , the holy grail of the planet sleuths has been to find the small guys ; after all , bantam worlds are more likely to be similar to our own .
Well , last week a horde of astronomers jointly announced a new , cool planet weighing in at about five times the mass of the Earth .
It 's still a beefy brute compared to terra firma , but a heck of a lot smaller than just about everything else found so far .
This planet ( which sports the quick - off - the - tongue name of OGLE - 2006 - BLG - 390 ) and its home star ( a dim , M - dwarf ) are interesting .
But what really arched my eyebrows was that this new punk planet was n't found with any of the usual schemes .
It was n't outed by the subtle dance of its host star , nor was it revealed because it eclipsed that star , dimming it ever so slightly .
This planet was discovered because mass bends light .
Or more accurately , mass bends space , and if space is bent , so are the light beams that dart through it .
This weird idea , as most readers will know , is completely at odds with Isaac Newton 's rigidly Cartesian conception of space - an immutable , three - dimensional stage , constructed of perfectly right - angled mathematical scaffolding .
In 1915 , Albert Einstein propounded the concept of warped space in his General Theory of Relativity .
Was he right ?
Einstein 's idea was radical , so proof was clearly required .
Arthur Eddington , a prominent British astronomer of the early twentieth century , realized that if mass really contorted space , then a flashlight beam passing near a bowling ball should bend slightly away from a straight line .
The problem is , it bends entirely too slightly to be measured , because bowling balls are n't very massive ( except in comparison to Pachinko balls ) .
Eddington , who was keen to check Einstein 's idea , suggested doing so by observing starlight as it passed near the biggest mass in the neighborhood : the Sun .
Of course , that 's not easy .
The Sun 's incandescent orb dashes any hope of seeing stars that are grazing its edges - except during a total solar eclipse .
Fortunately , there was a particularly long eclipse coming up on May 29 , 1919 .
Eddington and fellow astronomer Andrew Crommelin traveled to West Africa and Brazil respectively , to photograph the stars appearing adjacent to the Sun as the moon blocked its glare .
When the plates were developed and measured , Eddington found that the stars were , indeed , slightly nudged from their normal positions in accord with the prediction of General Relativity .
It had been proven that mass bends space , and warped space bends light beams .
Einstein was right .
Newton , who had been dead for three hundred years , refused comment .
Aside from revolutionizing physics , using big masses to bend light has turned out to have some practical astronomical applications .
After all , mirrors and lenses bend light too .
So can you build a mass - based telescope ?
Well , you can , if you 're willing to accept what 's available in God 's optics shop .
For example , when the Hubble Telescope is trained on a large cluster of galaxies - one whose collective bulk might be 100 trillion times the mass of the Sun - it often finds giant arcs of light looping through the field of view .
These arcs are the distorted images of galaxies lying far beyond the cluster , brightened and bent by the effects of its mass .
It was this type of gravitational lensing that the international research team that discovered OGLE - 2005 - BLG - 390 brought to bear .
This group uses a network of small telescopes to monitor large numbers of stars near the central neighborhoods of the Milky Way .
In these crowded stellar realms , a star will occasionally pass in front of another , acting as a gravitational lens - a giant magnifying glass - to boost the latter 's brightness by a factor of three or so .
The surge in intensity typically lasts for about a day .
In this case , there were irregularities in the brightening , and these irregularities betrayed a planet orbiting the nearer star .
It 's a technique that has the capability of finding very small worlds around very small stars .
SETI Scope
But here 's another bright idea , one that was pointed out by SETI pioneer Frank Drake and Stanford engineer Von Eshleman nearly two decades ago .
You could use this gravitational lensing technique to build the mother of all radio telescopes .
Well , actually , you do n't have to build it ; you merely have to get in position to use it .
All that 's required is to bolt a small SETI antenna and radio receiver onto a spacecraft , and send it cruising to the lonely , outer fringes of our solar system - to about twenty times the distance of Pluto ( for the quantitatively inclined , the minimum distance is 550 astronomical units ) .
Once there , the antenna would look back towards the Sun - which at that distance appears only as a dim star .
Nonetheless , the Sun would act as an enormous radio lens , amplifying any signals from star systems on the other side .
Indeed , the effective size of this solar lens would be roughly thirty thousand times the collecting area of the gargantuan Arecibo Radio Telescope in Puerto Rico .
It could detect a transmitter with the power of your local TV station at a distance of a hundred light - years , even if the alien broadcasters were n't beaming our way .
While this idea is seductive , it 's not lacking in potential gotcha's .
You 'd want to have the spacecraft orbit the Sun in the plane of the Milky Way , so as to maximize the number of star systems put " under the loupe " .
But the time spent looking at any one star system would be very short , so you 'd need a setup that could reliably recognize a signal heard only briefly , and only once .
In addition , there 's the small matter of arranging to send a spacecraft far beyond the fringes of the Kuiper Belt , and having it operate for years after it arrives .
Well , those are merely problems to be worked out by the student .
Sure , the gravitational lens SETI scope is not something we 'll do soon .
But the physics is there , and maybe someday the experiment will be there , too .
Then , perhaps , we may cup our radio ears to the whispers of distant beings , gliding our way on the subtle contours of space .

Plato : Hipparchus ( excerpts )
[ 225a ] SOCRATES :
What is love of profit ?
What can it be , and who are the lovers of profit ?
COMRADE :
In my opinion , they are those who think it worth while to make profit out of things of no worth .
SOCRATES : Is it your opinion that they know those things to be of no worth , or do not know ?
For if they do not know , you mean that the lovers of profit are fools .
COMRADE : No , I do not mean they are fools , but rascals who wickedly yield to profit , because they know that the things out of which they dare to make their profit are worthless , [ 225 b ] and yet they dare to be lovers of profit from mere shamelessness .
SOCRATES : Well now , do you mean by the lover of profit such a man , for instance , as a farmer who plants something which he knows is a worthless herb , and thinks fit to make profit out of it when he has reared it up ?
Is that the sort of man you mean ?
COMRADE :
The lover of profit , as such , Socrates thinks he ought to make profit from everything .
SOCRATES : Please do not speak so recklessly , as though you had been wronged by someone , [ 225 c ] but give me your attention and answer just as you would if I were beginning my questions over again .
Do you not admit that the lover of profit has knowledge of the worth of the thing from which he thinks it worth while to make profit ?
COMRADE : I do .
SOCRATES : Then who has knowledge of the worth of plants , and of the sort of season and soil in which they are worth planting -- if we too may throw in one of those artful phrases1 which adroit pleaders use to trick out their speeches in the law courts ?
[ 225d ] COMRADE :
For my part , I should say a farmer .
SOCRATES : And by “ think it worth while to make profit ” do you mean aught but “ thinking one ought to make profit ” ?
COMRADE : I mean that .
SOCRATES :
Then do not attempt to deceive me , who am now quite an elderly person ,
[ 226a ] and you so young , by making , as you did just now , an answer that is not even your own thought ; but tell me in all truth , do you suppose that any man who was taking up farming and who knew it was a worthless plant that he was planting , could think to make profit from it ?
COMRADE : Upon my word , I do not .
SOCRATES : Or again , take a horseman who knows that he is providing worthless food for his horse ; do you suppose he is unaware that he is destroying his horse ?
COMRADE : I do not .
[ 226 b ] SOCRATES :
So he does not think to make profit from that worthless food .
COMRADE : No .
SOCRATES : Or again , take a navigator who has furnished his ship with worthless spars and ropes ; do you think he is unaware that he will suffer for it , and will be in danger of being lost himself , and of losing the ship and all her cargo ?
COMRADE : I do not .
SOCRATES : So he does not think to make profit from [ 226 c ] that worthless tackle ?
COMRADE : No , indeed .
SOCRATES : But does a general , who knows that his army has worthless arms , think to make profit , or think it worth while to make profit , from them ?
COMRADE : By no means .
SOCRATES : Or does a flute - player who has worthless flutes , or a harper with a lyre , a bowman with a bow , or anyone else at all , in short , among ordinary craftsmen or sensible men in general , with any implement or other equipment of any sort that is worthless , think to make profit from it ?
[ 226d ] COMRADE :
To all appearance , no .
SOCRATES : Then whoever can they be , your lovers of profit ?
For I presume they are not the people whom we have successively mentioned , but people who know their worthless things , and yet think they are to make profit from them .
But in that case , by what you say , remarkable sir , no man alive is a lover of profit
COMRADE : Well , Socrates
I should like to call those lovers of profit who from insatiable greed consumedly long for things that are even quite petty and of little or no worth , [ 226e ] and so love profit , in each case .
SOCRATES : Not knowing , of course , my excellent friend , that the things are worthless ; for we have already convinced ourselves by our argument that this is impossible .
COMRADE : I agree .
SOCRATES : And if not knowing this , clearly they are ignorant of it , but think that those worthless things are worth a great deal .
COMRADE : Apparently .
SOCRATES : Now , of course lovers of profit must love profit ?
COMRADE : Yes .
SOCRATES : And by profit you mean the opposite of loss ?
[ 227a ] COMRADE : I do .
SOCRATES : And is it a good thing for anyone to suffer loss ?
COMRADE : For no one .
SOCRATES : Rather an evil ?
COMRADE : Yes .
SOCRATES : So mankind are harmed by loss .
COMRADE : They are harmed .
SOCRATES : Then loss is an evil .
COMRADE : Yes .
SOCRATES : And profit is the opposite of loss .
COMRADE : The opposite .
SOCRATES : So that profit is a good .
COMRADE : Yes .
SOCRATES : Hence it is those who love the good that you call lovers of profit .
COMRADE : So it seems .
[ 227 b ] SOCRATES :
At least there is nothing mad , my friend , about lovers of profit , as you describe them .
But tell me , do you yourself love , or not love , whatever is good ?
COMRADE : I love it .
SOCRATES : And is there anything good that you do not love , or must it then be evil ?
COMRADE : Upon my word , nothing .
SOCRATES : In fact , I expect you love all good things .
COMRADE : Yes .
SOCRATES : Well now , ask me on my side whether I do not likewise : for I shall agree with you , for my part , that I love good things .
But besides you and me , do you not think that all the rest of mankind [ 227c ] love good things , and hate evil things ?
COMRADE : It appears so to me .
SOCRATES : And we admitted that profit is good ?
COMRADE : Yes .
SOCRATES : On this new showing , everyone appears to be a lover of profit ; whereas , by our former way of arguing , no one was a lover of profit .
So on which of the two arguments are we to rely , in order to avoid error ?
COMRADE : What has to be done , I think , Socrates : , is to conceive the lover of profit rightly .
The right view of the lover of profit is that he is one who concerns himself with ,
[ 227d ] and thinks fit to make profit from , things from which honest men do not dare to make profit .
SOCRATES : But you see , my sweet sir , we have just admitted that making profit is being benefited .
COMRADE : Well , what of that ?
SOCRATES :
There is the further point we have admitted in addition to this -- that all men wish for good things always .
COMRADE : Yes .
SOCRATES : Then good men likewise wish to have all profits , if these are good things .
[ 227e ] COMRADE :
Not those profits from which they are bound , Socrates , to suffer harm .
SOCRATES : By “ suffer harm ” do you mean “ suffer loss , ” or something else ?
COMRADE : No , I mean just “ suffer loss . ”
SOCRATES : Well , do men suffer loss from profit or from loss ?
COMRADE : From both ; for they suffer loss from loss and from wicked profit .
SOCRATES : Pray now , do you consider that any useful and good thing is wicked ?
COMRADE : I do not .
[ 228a ] SOCRATES :
And we admitted a little while ago that profit is the opposite of loss , which is an evil .
COMRADE : I agree .
SOCRATES : And that , being the opposite of an evil , it is good ?
COMRADE : That was our admission .
SOCRATES : So you see , you are attempting to deceive me , for you deliberately contradict what we agreed to just now .
COMRADE : No , on my honor , Socrates ; on the contrary , it is you who are deceiving me , by twisting this way and that so perplexingly in your talk .
[ 229e ] SOCRATES :
Well now , as though we were playing a board game with pieces , I am willing to let you take back , as you please , anything you have said in carrying on the discussion , in order that you may not think you are being deceived .
So tell me , shall I take back for you the statement that all men desire good things ?
COMRADE : No , thank you .
SOCRATES : Well , that suffering loss , or loss , is an evil ?
COMRADE : No , thank you .
SOCRATES : Well , that profit , or making profit , is the opposite of loss , or suffering loss ?
[ 230a ] COMRADE : Nor that either .
SOCRATES : Well , that making profit , as the opposite of evil , is a good ?
COMRADE :
It ’s not always good ; take that back for me .
SOCRATES : You think , then , it seems , that some profit is good , and some evil .
COMRADE : I do .
SOCRATES : Well then , I ’ll take that back for you ; so let us assume that some profit is good , and some other profit evil .
But the good sort is no more profit than the evil sort , is it ?
COMRADE : What do you mean by this question ?
SOCRATES : I will explain .
Is there both good and evil food ?
[ 230 b ] COMRADE : Yes .
SOCRATES : And is the one sort more food than the other , or are they both similarly this same thing , food , and in this respect does the one differ no wise from the other , in being food , but only in the fact of the one being good and the other evil ?
COMRADE : Yes .
SOCRATES : And so with drink and every other class of things that exist , when some things in any class come to be good , and others evil , one thing does not differ from another in that respect whereby they are the same ?
For instance , [ 230c ] one man , I suppose , is virtuous , and another wicked .
COMRADE : Yes .
SOCRATES : But neither of them , I conceive , is more or less man than the other -- neither the virtuous than the wicked , nor the wicked than the virtuous .
COMRADE : What you say is true .
SOCRATES : Then are we to take the same view of profit also , that both the wicked and the virtuous sort are similarly profit ?
COMRADE : Necessarily .
SOCRATES : So he who has virtuous profit is no whit the more a profiter than he who has wicked profit : neither sort [ 230d ] is found to be more profit , as we agree .
COMRADE : Yes .
SOCRATES : For neither of them has addition of either more or less .
COMRADE : No , indeed .
SOCRATES : And how could one do or suffer anything more or less with a thing of this sort , that had neither of these additions ?
COMRADE : Impossible .
SOCRATES : Since , therefore , both of these are profits and profit - making affairs , we must now consider what it can be that leads you to call both of them profit : [ 230e ] what is it that you see to be the same in both ?
Suppose you were to ask me , in those instances that I gave just now , what it is that leads me to call both good food and evil food alike food , I should tell you -- for this reason , because both are a dry sustenance of the body .
For that , I am sure you would agree , is what food is , would you not ?
COMRADE : I would .
SOCRATES : And so too about drink the answer would be on the same lines , that the wet sustenance of the body , [ 231a ] whether it be wholesome or pernicious , has this name of drink ; and likewise with the rest .
Try therefore on your part to imitate my method of answering .
When you say that virtuous profit and wicked profit are both profit , what is it that you see to be the same in them , judging it to be the actual element of profit ?
And if again you are yourself unable to answer , just let me put it for your consideration , whether you describe as profit every acquisition that one has acquired either with no expense , or as a profit over and above one 's expense .
[ 231b ] COMRADE : I believe that is what I call profit .
SOCRATES : Do you include a case where , after enjoying a banquet at which one has had much good cheer without any expense , one acquires an illness ?
COMRADE : Upon my word , not I .
SOCRATES : And if one acquired health from attending a banquet , would one acquire profit or loss ?
COMRADE : Profit .
SOCRATES : Hence profit is not just acquiring any acquisition .
COMRADE : No , indeed .
SOCRATES : Do you mean , not if it is evil ?
Or will one acquire no profit even if one acquires something good ?
COMRADE : Apparently one will , if it is good .
[ 231c ] SOCRATES :
And if it is evil , will not one suffer loss ?
COMRADE : I think so .
SOCRATES : You see , then , how you are running round again to the same old point ?
Profit is found to be good , and loss evil .
COMRADE : For my part , I can not tell what to say .
SOCRATES : And not without good reason , sir .
Now answer this further question : you say that if one acquires more than the amount one has spent , it is profit ?
COMRADE : I do not mean , when it is evil , but if one gets more gold or silver than one has spent .
SOCRATES : Now , I am just going to ask you about that .
Tell me , [ 231d ] if one spends half a pound of gold and gets double that weight in silver , has one got profit or loss ?
COMRADE : Loss , I presume , Socrates ; for one 's gold is reduced to twice , instead of twelve times , the value of silver .
SOCRATES : But you see , one has got more ; or is double not more than half ?
COMRADE : Not in worth , the one being silver and the other gold .
SOCRATES : So profit , it seems , must have this addition of worth .
At least , you now say that silver , though more than gold , is not worth as much , and that gold , though less , is of equal worth .
[ 231e ] COMRADE : Assuredly , for that is the case .
SOCRATES :
Then the valuable is what produces profit , whether it be small or great , and the valueless produces no profit .
COMRADE : Yes .
SOCRATES : And by the valuable you mean simply , valuable to possess ?
COMRADE : Yes , to possess .
SOCRATES : And again , by what is valuable to possess , do you mean the unprofitable or the profitable ?
COMRADE : The profitable , I presume .
SOCRATES : And the profitable is good ?
COMRADE : Yes .
[ 232a ] SOCRATES :
And so , most valiant of men , have we not here once more , for the third or fourth time , the admission that what produces profit is good ?
COMRADE : So it seems .
SOCRATES : Then do you remember the point from which this discussion of ours arose ?
COMRADE : I think I do .
SOCRATES : In case you do not , I will remind you .
You maintained against me that good men do not wish to make all sorts of profit , but only those profits that are good , and not those that are wicked .
COMRADE : Yes .
[ 232 b ] SOCRATES :
And now the argument has compelled us to acknowledge that all profits , both small and great , are good ?
COMRADE : Yes , it has compelled me , at least , Socrates , rather than persuaded me .
SOCRATES : Well , later on , perhaps , it might also persuade you .
Now , however , whether you are persuaded or whatever is your feeling , you at least agree with me that all profits are good , both small and great ones .
COMRADE : Yes , I do admit it .
SOCRATES : And you admit that virtuous men all wish for all good things , do you not ?
COMRADE : I do .
[ 232c ] SOCRATES : But , you know , you stated yourself that wicked men love both small and great profits .
COMRADE : I did .
SOCRATES : And so , by your account , all men will be lovers of profit , whether they be virtuous or wicked .
COMRADE : Apparently .
SOCRATES : Hence it is not right to reproach anybody with being a lover of profit : for he who makes this reproach is actually a lover of profit himself .

Senior British diplomatic and military staff gave Tony Blair explicit warnings three years ago that the US was disastrously mishandling the occupation of Iraq , according to leaked memos .
John Sawers , Mr Blair 's envoy in Baghdad in the aftermath of the invasion , sent a series of confidential memos to Downing Street in May and June 2003 cataloguing US failures .
With unusual frankness , he described the US postwar administration , led by the retired general Jay Garner , as " an unbelievable mess " and said " Garner and his top team of 60 - year - old retired generals " were " well - meaning but out of their depth " .
That assessment is reinforced by Major General Albert Whitley , the most senior British officer with the US land forces .
Gen Whitley , in another memo later that summer , expressed alarm that the US - British coalition was in danger of losing the peace .
" We may have been seduced into something we might be inclined to regret .
Is strategic failure a possibility ?
The answer has to be ' yes ' , " he concluded .
The memos were obtained by Michael Gordon , author , along with General Bernard Trainor , of Cobra II : the Inside Story of the Invasion and Occupation of Iraq , published to coincide with the third anniversary of the invasion .
The British memos identified a series of US failures that contained the seeds of the present insurgency and anarchy .
The mistakes include :
· A lack of interest by the US commander , General Tommy Franks , in the post - invasion phase .
· The presence in the capital of the US Third Infantry Division , which took a heavyhanded approach to security .
· Squandering the initial sympathy of Iraqis .
· Bechtel , the main US civilian contractor , moving too slowly to reconnect basic services , such as electricity and water .
· Failure to deal with health hazards , such as 40 % of Baghdad 's sewage pouring into the Tigris and rubbish piling up in the streets .
· Sacking of many of Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath party , even though many of them held relatively junior posts .
Mr Sawers , in a memo titled Iraq : What 's Going Wrong , written on May 11 , four days after he had arrived in Baghdad , is uncompromising about the US administration in Baghdad .
He wrote : " No leadership , no strategy , no coordination , no structure and inaccessible to ordinary Iraqis . "
He said the US needed to take action in Baghdad urgently .
" The clock is ticking . "
Both Mr Sawers , who is now political director at the Foreign Office , and Gen Whitley see as one of the biggest errors a decision by Donald Rumsfeld , the US defence secretary , and General Tommy Franks , the overall US commander , to cut troops after the invasion .
Mr Sawers advocated sending a British battalion , the 16th Air Assault Brigade , to Baghdad to help fill the gap .
Although the US supported the plan , Downing Street rejected it weeks later .
The British diplomat is particularly scathing about the US Third Infantry Division , which he describes as " a big part of the problem " in Baghdad .
He accused its troops of being reluctant to leave their heavily armoured vehicles to carry out policing and cites an incident in which British Paras saw them fire three tank rounds into a building in response to harmless rifle fire .
Mr Sawers , who had been British ambassador to Egypt before being sent to Iraq and is at present on a shortlist to be the next ambassador to Washington , sent the memo to Mr Blair 's key advisers , including Jonathan Powell , the No 10 chief of staff , and Alastair Campbell , head of the Downing Street press operation at the time .
Mr Sawers , in later memos , welcomed the replacement of Gen Garner with Paul Bremer , a US diplomat .
But in a memo written in June 25 , Mr Sawyer concluded that , despite Mr Bremer 's arrival , the situation was getting worse .
In that memo , Mr Sawers expressed opposition to further troop reductions .
" Bremer 's main concern is that we must keep in - country sufficient military capability to ensure a security blanket across the country .
He has twice said to President Bush that he is concerned that the drawdown of US / UK troops had gone too far , and we cannot afford further reductions , " Mr Sawers said .
Throughout his time in Iraq , however , Mr Sawers remained optimistic Mr Bremer would make a difference .
His views in the memo are echoed in a note by Gen Whitley , who says that while Gen Franks took credit for the fall of Baghdad , he showed little interest in the postwar period .
" I am quite sure Franks did not want to take ownership of Phase IV , " Gen Whitley wrote .
He added that Phase IV " did not work well " because the concentration was on the invasion .
" There was a blind faith that Phase IV would work .
There was a failure to anticipate the extent of the backlash or mood of Iraqi society . "
Global Warming is a dramatically urgent and serious problem .
We do n’t need to wait for governments to find a solution for this problem : each individual can bring an important help
adopting a more responsible lifestyle : starting from little , everyday things .
It ’s the only reasonable way to save our planet , before it is too late .
Here is a list of 50 simple things that everyone can do in order to
fight against and reduce the Global Warming phenomenon : some of these ideas are at no cost , some other require a little effort or investment but can help you save a lot of money , in the middle - long term !
Check out the Top 50 Things To Do To Stop Global Warming
1. Replace a regular incandescent light bulb with a compact fluorescent light bulb ( cfl )
CFLs use 60 % less energy than a regular bulb .
This simple switch will save about 300 pounds of carbon dioxide a year .
We recommend you purchase your CFL bulbs at 1000 bulbs.com , they have great deals on both screw - in and plug - in light bulbs .
2. Install a programmable thermostat
Programmable thermostats will automatically lower the heat or air conditioning at night and raise them again in the morning .
They can save you $ 100 a year on your energy bill .
3 . Move your thermostat down 2° in winter and up 2° in summer
Almost half of the energy we use in our homes goes to heating and cooling .
You could save about 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year with this simple adjustment .
4. Clean or replace filters on your furnace and air conditioner
Cleaning a dirty air filter can save 350 pounds of carbon dioxide a year .
5 . Choose energy efficient appliances when making new purchases
Look for the Energy Star label on new appliances to choose the most energy efficient products available .
6 . Do not leave appliances on standby
Use the “ on / off ” function on the machine itself .
A TV set that ’s switched on for 3 hours a day ( the average time Europeans spend watching TV ) and in standby mode during the remaining 21 hours uses about 40 % of its energy in standby mode .
7 . Wrap your water heater in an insulation blanket
You ’ll save 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year with this simple action .
You can save another 550 pounds per year by setting the thermostat no higher than 50°C .
8 . Move your fridge and freezer
Placing them next to the cooker or boiler consumes much more energy than if they were standing on their own .
For example , if you put them in a hot cellar room where the room temperature is 30 - 35 ºC , energy use is almost double and causes an extra 160 kg of CO2 emissions for fridges per year and 320 kg for freezers .
9 . Defrost old fridges and freezers regularly
Even better is to replace them with newer models , which all have automatic defrost cycles and are generally up to two times more energy - efficient than their predecessors .
10 .
Do n’t let heat escape from your house over a long period
When airing your house , open the windows for only a few minutes .
If you leave a small opening all day long , the energy needed to keep it warm inside during six cold months ( 10 ºC or less outside temperature ) would result in almost 1 ton of CO2 emissions .
11 . Replace your old single - glazed windows with double - glazing
This requires a bit of upfront investment , but will halve the energy lost through windows and pay off in the long term .
If you go for the best the market has to offer ( wooden - framed double - glazed units with low - emission glass and filled with argon gas ) , you can even save more than 70 % of the energy lost .
12 . Get a home energy audit
Many utilities offer free home energy audits to find where your home is poorly insulated or energy inefficient .
You can save up to 30 % off your energy bill and 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year .
Energy Star can help you find an energy specialist .
13 . Cover your pots while cooking
Doing so can save a lot of the energy needed for preparing the dish .
Even better are pressure cookers and steamers : they can save around 70 % !
14 .
Use the washing machine or dishwasher only when they are full
If you need to use it when it is half full , then use the half - load or economy setting .
There is also no need to set the temperatures high .
Nowadays detergents are so efficient that they get your clothes and dishes clean at low temperatures .
15 .
Take a shower instead of a bath
A shower takes up to four times less energy than a bath .
To maximize the energy saving , avoid power showers and use low - flow showerheads , which are cheap and provide the same comfort .
16 . Use less hot water
It takes a lot of energy to heat water .
You can use less hot water by installing a low flow showerhead ( 350 pounds of carbon dioxide saved per year ) and washing your clothes in cold or warm water ( 500 pounds saved per year ) instead of hot .
17 .
Use a clothesline instead of a dryer whenever possible
You can save 700 pounds of carbon dioxide when you air dry your clothes for 6 months out of the year .
18 . Insulate and weatherize your home
Properly insulating your walls and ceilings can save 25 % of your home heating bill and 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year .
Caulking and weather - stripping can save another 1,700 pounds per year .
Energy Efficient has more information on how to better insulate your home .
19 .
Be sure you ’re recycling at home
You can save 2,400 pounds of carbon dioxide a year by recycling half of the waste your household generates .
20 . Recycle your organic waste
Around 3 % of the greenhouse gas emissions through the methane is released by decomposing bio-degradable waste .
By recycling organic waste or composting it if you have a garden , you can help eliminate this problem !
Just make sure that you compost it properly , so it decomposes with sufficient oxygen , otherwise your compost will cause methane emissions and smell foul .
21 . Buy intelligently
One bottle of 1.5l requires less energy and produces less waste than three bottles of 0.5l .
As well , buy recycled paper products : it takes less 70 to 90 % less energy to make recycled paper and it prevents the loss of forests worldwide .
22 . Choose products that come with little packaging and buy refills when you can
You will also cut down on waste production and energy use … another help against global warming .
23 . Reuse your shopping bag
When shopping , it saves energy and waste to use a reusable bag instead of accepting a disposable one in each shop .
Waste not only discharges CO2 and methane into the atmosphere , it can also pollute the air , groundwater and soil .
24 . Reduce waste
Most products we buy cause greenhouse gas emissions in one or another way , e.g. during production and distribution .
By taking your lunch in a reusable lunch box instead of a disposable one , you save the energy needed to produce new lunch boxes .
25 . Plant a tree
A single tree will absorb one ton of carbon dioxide over its lifetime .
Shade provided by trees can also reduce your air conditioning bill by 10 to 15 % .
The Arbor Day Foundation has information on planting and provides trees you can plant with membership .
26 . Switch to green power
In many areas , you can switch to energy generated by clean , renewable sources such as wind and solar .
In some of these , you can even get refunds by government if you choose to switch to a clean energy producer , and you can also earn money by selling the energy you produce and do n’t use for yourself .
27 . Buy locally grown and produced foods
The average meal in the United States travels 1,200 miles from the farm to your plate .
Buying locally will save fuel and keep money in your community .
28 . Buy fresh foods instead of frozen
Frozen food uses 10 times more energy to produce .
29 .
Seek out and support local farmers markets
They reduce the amount of energy required to grow and transport the food to you by one fifth .
Seek farmer ’s markets in your area , and go for them .
30 .
Buy organic foods as much as possible
Organic soils capture and store carbon dioxide at much higher levels than soils from conventional farms .
If we grew all of our corn and soybeans organically , we ’d remove 580 billion pounds of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere !
31 . Eat less meat
Methane is the second most significant greenhouse gas and cows are one of the greatest methane emitters .
Their grassy diet and multiple stomachs cause them to produce methane , which they exhale with every breath .
32 . Reduce the number of miles you drive by walking , biking , carpooling or taking mass transit wherever possible
Avoiding just 10 miles of driving every week would eliminate about 500 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions a year !
Look for transit options in your area .
33 . Start a carpool with your coworkers or classmates
Sharing a ride with someone just 2 days a week will reduce your carbon dioxide emissions by 1,590 pounds a year .
eRideShare.com runs a free service connecting north american commuters and travelers .
34 .
Do n’t leave an empty roof rack on your car
This can increase fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by up to 10 % due to wind resistance and the extra weight – removing it is a better idea .
35 . Keep your car tuned up
Regular maintenance helps improve fuel efficiency and reduces emissions .
When just 1 % of car owners properly maintain their cars , nearly a billion pounds of carbon dioxide are kept out of the atmosphere .
36 . Drive carefully and do not waste fuel
You can reduce CO2 emissions by readjusting your driving style .
Choose proper gears , do not abuse the gas pedal , use the engine brake instead of the pedal brake when possible and turn off your engine when your vehicle is motionless for more than one minute .
By readjusting your driving style you can save money on both fuel and car mantainance .
37 .
Check your tires weekly to make sure they ’re properly inflated
Proper tire inflation can improve gas mileage by more than 3 % .
Since every gallon of gasoline saved keeps 20 pounds of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere , every increase in fuel efficiency makes a difference !
38 .
When it is time for a new car , choose a more fuel efficient vehicle
You can save 3,000 pounds of carbon dioxide every year if your new car gets only 3 miles per gallon more than your current one .
You can get up to 60 miles per gallon with a hybrid !
You can find information on fuel efficiency on FuelEconomy and on GreenCars websites .
39 .
Try car sharing
Need a car but do n’t want to buy one ?
Community car sharing organizations provide access to a car and your membership fee covers gas , maintenance and insurance .
Many companies – such as Flexcar – offer low emission or hybrid cars too !
Also , see ZipCar .
40 .
Try telecommuting from home
Telecommuting can help you drastically reduce the number of miles you drive every week .
For more information , check out the Telework Coalition .
41 . Fly less
Air travel produces large amounts of emissions so reducing how much you fly by even one or two trips a year can reduce your emissions significantly .
You can also offset your air travel carbon emissions by investingin renewable energy projects .
42 . Encourage your school or business to reduce emissions
You can extend your positive influence on global warming well beyond your home by actively encouraging other to take action .
43 . Join the virtual march
The Stop Global Warming Virtual March is a non-political effort to bring people concerned about global warming together in one place .
Add your voice to the hundreds of thousands of other people urging action on this issue .
44 . Encourage the switch to renewable energy
Successfully combating global warming requires a national transition to renewable energy sources such as solar , wind and biomass .
These technologies are ready to be deployed more widely but there are regulatory barriers impeding them .
U.S. citizens , take action to break down those barriers with Vote Solar .
45 . Protect and conserve forest worldwide
Forests play a critical role in global warming : they store carbon .
When forests are burned or cut down , their stored carbon is release into the atmosphere – deforestation now accounts for about 20 % of carbon dioxide emissions each year .
Conservation International has more information on saving forests from global warming .
46 . Consider the impact of your investments
If you invest your money , you should consider the impact that your investments and savings will have on global warming .
Check out SocialInvest and Ceres to can learn more about how to ensure your money is being invested in companies , products and projects that address issues related to climate change .
47 .
Make your city cool
Cities and states around the country have taken action to stop global warming by passing innovative transportation and energy saving legislation .
If you ’re in the U.S. , join the cool cities list .
48 . Tell Congress to act
The McCain Lieberman Climate Stewardship and Innovation
Act would set a firm limit on carbon dioxide emissions and then use free market incentives to lower costs , promote efficiency and spur innovation .
Tell your representative to support it .
49 .
Make sure your voice is heard !
Americans must have a stronger commitment from their government in order to stop global warming and implement solutions and such a commitment wo n’t come without a dramatic increase in citizen lobbying for new laws with teeth .

Well it may not be the high - definition EyeToy HD IP webcam that gamers had been hoping for , but Sony has finally announced the ( first ? ) official EyeToy for PS3 , called simply the PlayStation Eye .
With an array of four microphones , two zoom levels , and capture rate as high as 120 fps , the Eye promises to deliver unprecedented cam - enhanced gameplay , although the VGA video resolution ( and that 's at ' only ' 60 fps ) will probably nonetheless be a disappointment to some .
Bundled in with the not - yet - priced package will be EyeCreate editing software , which allows users to add different effects to their content as well as record footage using time - lapse and slow - mo settings , among others .
No word yet on other specs ( still shot res ? ) or compatible games , either , but we imagine that a lot more info will trickle out as the Eye 's planned summer release date grows nearer .
Update :
Well what do you know , Sony and Hasbro also announced Eye of Judgment , the visual , interactive - card driven game they demoed at E3 last year .
Good luck keeping people from printing out their own cards from the internet , guys .
Should be out in Europe this summer , and the rest of the world this fall .

Pilot 's family watched as jet crashed in final minutes of air show
• Beaufort County coroner 's office confirms pilot killed
• The jet clipped the top of a pine tree during a sharp turn , a military source said
• The show was taking place near Beaufort , South Carolina
Adjust font size :
( CNN ) --
The family of the pilot killed Saturday watched as his F / A - 18 Hornet crashed in a neighborhood during a U.S. Navy Blue Angels precision - flying team air show , Lt. Commander Anthony Walley said Saturday .
A military source told CNN the jet clipped the top of a pine tree during a sharp turn at the end of the team 's aerial exhibition .
Fred Yelinek told CNN he saw the jet come down about 100 yards from him with an " earth - shattering rumble , " sparking a " huge fireball " and hurtling pieces of debris into homes .
" Our squadron , and the entire U.S. Navy , are grieving the loss of a great American , a great naval officer , and most of all , a great friend , " Walley said at a nighttime news conference in Beaufort , South Carolina .
The name of the pilot and information about him were being withheld for 24 hours , per a Department of Defense policy .
A Navy statement said the aviator had been on the team for two years -- and it was his first as a demonstration pilot .
The accident was under investigation , the statement said .
( Watch possible factors in the crash )
The jet crashed about 4 p.m. some three miles from Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort , which was hosting the two - day show , Walley said .
William Winn , Beaufort County emergency management director , said the crash damaged several houses .
Video of one home 's interior showed broken furniture , strewn debris , and chunks of exposed insulation and drywall .
( Watch the damage left by the crash )
Winn told The Associated Press that eight people on the ground were injured .
The extent of their injuries was not known .
Sunday 's air show , part of the Low Country Blues Festival , would continue Sunday as scheduled , but the Blue Angels would not perform , Marine Corps Capt .
Sarah Kansteiner said .
Yelinek said the jet struck a stand of pine trees , and pieces of the plane hit homes , but he did n't see any catch fire .
The pieces were " as big as a hand but no larger , " he said .
( Watch Yelinek describe how the plane struck trees )
The AP described the crash site as a neighborhood of small houses and trailers .
Photos from the site showed a street littered with debris , some of it resembling blown - out tires , and nearby trees on fire with smoke trailing away .
There were no large pieces of debris .
Pieces of a tree and the plane crashed into the home of a neighbor , Yelinek said , but she was uninjured .
Pieces also hit other houses and smashed car windshields , he said .
" Most people were very shaken but unhurt , " the witness said .
" I was working on a pump in the yard across the street from the initial impact , and I heard the Blue Angel go over ... in a full , tight formation , " Yelinek said .
" And then , four or five minutes later , I hear them coming again , expecting to see pretty much the same thing .
But I did n't hear any strange noises .
And then it was the crashing sound of pieces of the airplane coming through the trees in the yard across the street . "
" And then a huge fireball , maybe 200 , 300 yards further on down .
The debris started from the first impact with a pine tree , which was maybe 100 yards from my location . "
" Part of the tree and the debris went through a house in that yard , then the main body of the airplane continued on about 300 more yards and hit about one city block further down at the intersection of Shanklin and Pine Grove roads .

" There 's a lot of houses on all four corners of that intersection .
And there was a lot of fire at that intersection , and continuing thereafter . "
Another witness , Gerald Popp , said the six jets had been flying for about five minutes before one of them turned south , toward the Broad River .
( Watch the story of the Blue Angels )
" I saw him go down lower than the trees , and next I saw a big black cloud of smoke , " said Popp , who also lives in Beaufort .
Pam and Bill Edwards said they were watching the air show from the media stand when they realized something was terribly wrong .
" It was right at the end of the air show ... we counted four planes landing , and there was one circling in that smoky area right over the crash site , " Bill Edwards said .
" I looked around the sky , and there was nothing else there .
Then we saw the emergency helicopter go up , and we automatically assumed the worst at that point . "
While the cause of the crash is unknown , Justin Cooke , an off - duty air traffic controller at the base , told CNN that birds pose a frequent problem to jets flying in the area , and can cause a crash .
" On an F - 18 , you have two motors , and if they take [ a bird ] in the engine , it could cause engine failure and shut that down , " he said .
He said the plane is capable of flying in excess of 450 mph .
The show also featured other aerial demonstration teams and civilian and military aircraft displays .
CNN meteorologists said the weather in Beaufort , which is near Savannah , Georgia , was clear .
The most recent crash involving the Blue Angels was in 1999 in south Georgia .
Two aviators were killed when their F / A - 18 jet crashed while trying to land during a training flight .
The Blue Angels , founded in 1951 , perform for an estimated 15 million people at air shows each year .

Nanotechnology , ocean creatures and electronics
( Nanowerk News )
The three - dimensional shells of tiny ocean creatures could provide the foundation for novel electronic devices , including gas sensors able to detect pollution faster and more efficiently than conventional devices .
Image shows a sensor created from a microporous silicon structure converted from the shell ( frustule ) of a single diatom .
( Image : Georgia Tech )
Using a chemical process that converts the shells  original silica ( silicon dioxide , SiO 2 ) into the semiconductor material silicon , researchers have created a new class of gas sensors based on the unique and intricate three - dimensional ( 3 - D ) shells produced by microscopic creatures known as diatoms .
The converted shells , which retain the 3 - D shape and nanoscale detail of the originals , could also be useful as battery electrodes , chemical purifiers  and in other applications requiring complex shapes that nature can produce better than humans .
 When we conducted measurements for the detection of nitric oxide , a common pollutant , our single diatom - derived silicon sensor possessed a combination of speed , sensitivity , and low voltage operation that exceeded conventional sensors ,  said Kenneth H. Sandhage , a professor in the School of Materials Science and Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology .
 The unique diatom - derived shape , high surface area and nanoporous , nanocrystalline silicon material all contributed towards such attractive gas sensing characteristics . 
The unique devices , part of a broader long - term research program by Sandhage and his research team , were described in the March 8 issue of the journal Nature .
The research was sponsored by the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the U.S. Office of Naval Research .
Scientists estimate that roughly 100,000 species of diatoms exist in nature , and each forms a microshell with a unique and often complex 3 - D shape that includes cylinders , wheels , fans , donuts , circles and stars .
Sandhage and his research team have worked for several years to take advantage of those complex shapes by converting the original silica into materials that are more useful .
A silicon replica made from diatom microshells glows .
The conversion process from the original silica retains the intricate structure of the microshells .

Ultimately , they would like to conduct such conversion reactions on genetically - modified diatoms that generate microshells with tailored shapes .
However , to precisely alter and control the structures produced , further research is needed to learn how to manipulate the genome of the diatom .
Since scientists already know how to culture diatoms in large volumes , harnessing the diatom genetic code could allow mass - production of complex and tailored microscopic structures .
Sandhages colleagues , Prof. Nils Kröger ( School of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Georgia Tech ) and Dr. Mark Hildebrand ( Scripps Institution of Oceanography ) are currently conducting research that could ultimately allow for genetic engineering of diatom microshell shapes .
 Diatoms are fabulous for making very precise shapes , and making the same shape over and over again by a reproduction process that , under the proper growth conditions , yields microshells at a geometrically - increasing rate ,  Sandhage noted .
 Diatoms can produce three - dimensional structures that are not easy to produce using conventional silicon - based processes .
The potential here is for making enormous numbers of complicated 3 - D shapes and tailoring the shapes genetically , followed by chemical modification as we have conducted to convert the shells into functional materials such as silicon . 
Silicon is normally produced from silica at temperatures well above the silicon melting point ( 1,414 degrees Celsius ) , so that solid silicon replicas cannot be directly produced from silica structures with such conventional processing .
So the Georgia Tech researchers used a reaction based on magnesium gas that converted the silica of the shells into a composite containing silicon ( Si ) and magnesium oxide ( MgO ) .
The conversion took place at only 650 degrees Celsius , which allowed preservation of the complex channels and hollow cylindrical shape of the diatom .
The magnesium oxide , which makes up about two - thirds of the composite , was then dissolved out by a hydrochloric acid solution , which left a highly porous silicon structure that retained the original shape .
The structure was then treated with hydrofluoric acid ( HF ) to remove traces of silica created by reaction with the water in the hydrochloric acid solution .
The researchers then connected individual diatom - derived silicon structures to electrodes , applied current and used them to detect nitric oxide .
The highly porous silicon shells , which are about 10 micrometers in length , could also be used to immobilize enzymes for purifying drugs in high - performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) and as improved electrodes in lithium - ion batteries .
 Silicon can form compounds that have a high lithium content ,  Sandhage said .
 Because diatom - derived silicon structures have a high surface area and are thin walled and highly porous , the rate at which you can get lithium ions into and out of such silicon structures can be high .
For a given battery size , you could store more power , use it more rapidly or recharge the battery faster by using such structures as electrodes . 
In testing , the researchers showed that the silicon they produced was photoluminescent  meaning it glows when illuminated by certain wavelengths of light .
That shows the fabrication process produced a nanoporous , nanocrystalline structure  and may have interesting photonic applications in addition to the electronic ones .
Though Sandhage and his collaborators have demonstrated the potential of their technique , significant challenges must be overcome before they can produce useful sensors , battery electrodes and other structures .
The sensors will have to be packaged into useful devices , for example , connected into arrays of devices able to detect different gases and scaled up for volume manufacture .
The Aulacoseira diatoms used in the research reported by Nature were millions of years old , obtained from samples mined and distributed as diatomaceous earth .
To provide samples with other geometries , Sandhages group has set up a cell culturing lab , with the assistance of Georgia Tech colleagues Nils Kröger and Nicole Poulson , to grow the brownish - colored diatoms .
Sandhage , who is a ceramist by training , would now like to work directly with electronics engineers and others who have specific interests in silicon - based devices .
 We can target diatoms of a certain shape , generate the right chemistry , and then work with applications engineers to get these unique structures into practice ,  he said .
 We are now at the point where we have a good idea of the chemical palette that is accessible with the conversion approaches we have taken .
The next step is really to start making packaged devices . 
There might not be any bigger scumbags in the corporate world today than the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) .
And that 's not my take .
There 's a reason for that :
The liberal blogosophere is united on many fronts -- not just disliking US foreign policy .
We also hate the RIAA -- for suing our friends , for lobbying for laws that suspend due process rights of the accused ( the RIAA 's favorite law , the DMCA , was used by Diebold to suppress information about failures in its voting machines ) , and for demanding the right to " pretext " ( commit wire fraud ) in order to catch " pirates . "
Worse still , the RIAA are part of the initiative to corrupt net neutrality , imposing centralized controls on the transmission of information across the network .
And now , the Howard Dean and the DNC have apparently hired the RIAA 's top shill , Jenni Engebretsen , as a " Deputy CEO for Public Affairs " for the upcoming convention in Denver .
It has been Engebretsen 's job to sell these initiatives to the American public .
She 's failed to sell this to the American public .
Not only does she take a paycheck for selling gangsters to the public -- she 's not very good at it !
As Boing Boing notes , the DNC could do better .

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
Two suicide car bombers struck a small U.S. patrol base in Diyala province Monday , killing nine American soldiers and wounding 20 others , according to a U.S. military official in Diyala .
All of the casualties were members of the Army 's 82nd Airborne , based in Fort Bragg , North Carolina , the U.S. military said in a statement
" Today represents the single greatest loss of life for soldiers from Fort Bragg in more than five years of simultaneous deployment , " media affairs officer Maj .
Tom Earnhardt told CNN .
In a 1994 training accident , 23 base personnel died in a crash at neighboring Pope Air Force Base .
Earlier , in a separate incident , the military said a U.S. soldier was killed in Muqtadya , northeast of Baghdad , by a roadside bomb .
Muqtadya is a city in Diyala province located about 25 miles ( 40 kilometers ) northeast of the provincial capital of Baquba .
Also Monday , a suicide car bomber targeted a gathering of police vehicles in Baquba , killing six police officers , including a police general , a Diyala province police official said .
Dozens killed in insurgent attacks
Insurgents targeted Iraqis eating at restaurants , police patrolling the cities , a Kurdish political office and a Sunni mosque in a string of attacks in Iraq on Monday that left at least 51 people dead and 96 wounded , according to Iraqi officials .
( Watch scenes of destruction from Baghdad bombs )
The deadliest attack happened when a suicide car bomber struck a restaurant in Ramadi , west of Baghdad , killing 20 civilians and wounding 35 , an Interior Ministry official said .
A suicide car bomber struck a police checkpoint just outside Ramadi , killing four and wounding six civilians and police , a police official said .
In Baghdad , seven people were killed and 16 wounded when a suicide bomber detonated an explosive vest inside a restaurant near the Green Zone , Baghdad police said .
The restaurant was frequented by Baghdad police officers .
About a half - mile away from the restaurant , two parked car bombs exploded near Iran 's embassy within hours of each other , police said .
Insurgents also bombed a Sunni mosque in the southwestern Baghdad neighborhood of Baya'a .
They killed the mosque 's guard to gain entry then rigged the mosque with explosives .
No one was injured but the al - Kawthar mosque was damaged , an Interior Ministry official said .
A suicide car bomb detonated outside the Kurdish Democratic Party office in Tal Uskuf , killing at least 10 people and wounding 20 , according to KDP official Abdul Ghani Yahya .
Iraqis protest security wall
Despite the daily attacks across Iraq , thousands of Iraqis took to the streets Monday to protest a concrete wall surrounding Adhamiya , a Sunni neighborhood in Baghdad .
The U.S. and Iraqi militaries say the wall is a temporary structure to prevent insurgent attacks .
But many Baghdad residents fear walls will exacerbate the sectarian divide that is fueling the insurgency in the Iraqi capital .
( Watch why the wall was controversial )
" The aim of this wall is to isolate Adhamiya , " one resident told CNN .
" It 's a step we think that is not for the good of the people , but it's to isolate them like Falluja and other Sunni cities . "
Police estimated 7,000 Iraqis peacefully took to the street to voice their disapproval with the wall around Adhamiya , a Sunni enclave surrounded by Shiite neighborhoods .
Video showed the streets crowded with demonstrators , some carrying banners that read in English , " No to the sectarian barrier . "
While it is a known insurgent stronghold , Adhamiya has also been the target of Shiite death squads .
On Sunday , Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki expressed outrage , saying " the construction will stop . "
In response , the U.S. military issued a statement Monday saying " the construction of the wall is under review " and vowing to " coordinate with the Iraq government to establish effective appropriate security measures . "
But at a joint news conference later Monday , spokesmen for the U.S. and Iraqi militaries said there are no plans to stop erecting the security barriers , which they stressed are temporary .
The spokesman for the Baghdad security plan , Brig .
Gen. Qassim Atta said al - Maliki was responding to " groundless " media reports that a permanent wall -- 40 feet ( 12 meters ) high and 3 miles ( 5 kilometers ) long -- is being constructed .
" The prime minister is in agreement with the work of the security forces and the issue of security barriers , " Atta said at the news conference in Baghdad .
" We will continue to set up these barriers in Adhamiya and other areas . "
A combination of sand barriers , trenches , barbed wire and concrete barriers will be put in place temporarily to secure certain areas within the 10 Baghdad security districts , Atta said .
They will be moved after each area is secure , he said .
" We have noticed a big drop in terrorist attacks in areas where we already set up these security barriers , " he said .
The U.S. and Iraqi militaries have started setting up security barriers in Baladiyat , Zafaraniya , al - Shu'la , Baya 'a , Adhamiya , and the outskirts of Sadr City , Atta said .
" It 's a fluid situation and none of these barriers that we 're erecting are permanent , " U.S. military spokesman Rear Adm .
Mark Fox said during Monday 's news conference .
" We will be able to employ them as necessary . "
At a news conference in Cairo on Sunday , al - Maliki said that his previous comments expressed his " fear ( that ) this wall might have repercussions , which remind us of other walls we reject . "
He was apparently referring to the wall Israel constructed in the West Bank , and to the wall that divided Berlin during the Cold War .
CNN 's Jomana Karadsheh and Arwa Damon contributed to this report .
US : Pot Shrinks Tumors ; Government Knew In ' 74
by Raymond Cushing , ( 29 Mar 2001 ) San Antonio Current United States ( Wednesday , March 28 , The United States Supreme Court rules on whether marijuana use for medicinal purposes can be a valid defense on charges of marijuana possession .
The following article was listed as one of the top 25 censored stories of the year 2000 .
We reprint it here and pose the question , why would the government want to keep us from knowing this ? )
The term medical marijuana took on dramatic new meaning in February 2000 , when researchers in Madrid announced they had destroyed incurable brain tumors in rats by injecting them with THC , the active ingredient in cannabis .
The Madrid study marks only the second time that THC has been administered to tumor - bearing animals .
In 1974 , researchers at the Medical College of Virginia , who had been funded by the National Institutes of Health to find evidence that marijuana damages the immune system , found instead that THC slowed the growth of three kinds of cancer in mice -- lung and breast cancer , and a virus - induced leukemia .
The DEA quickly shut down the Virginia study and all further cannabis / tumor research , according to Jack Herer , who reports on the events in his book , The Emperor Wears No Clothes .
In 1976 , President Gerald Ford put an end to all public cannabis research and granted exclusive research rights to major pharmaceutical companies , who set out -- unsuccessfully -- to develop synthetic forms of THC that would deliver all the medical benefits without the " high . "
The Madrid researchers reported in the March issue of Nature Medicine that they injected the brains of 45 rats with cancer cells , producing tumors whose presence they confirmed through magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) .
On the 12th day they injected 15 of the rats with THC and 15 with Win -55,212 - 2 , a synthetic compound similar to THC .
" All the rats left untreated uniformly died 12 - 18 days after glioma ( brain cancer ) cell inoculation ... Cannabinoid ( THC ) - treated rats survived significantly longer than control rats .
THC administration was ineffective in three rats , which died by days 16 - 18 .
Nine of the THC - treated rats surpassed the time of death of untreated rats , and survived up to 19 - 35 days .
Moreover , the tumor was completely eradicated in three of the treated rats . "
The rats treated with Win -55,212 - 2 showed similar results .
The Spanish researchers , led by Dr. Manuel Guzman of Complutense University , also irrigated healthy rats ' brains with large doses of THC for seven days , to test for harmful biochemical or neurological effects .
They found none .
" Careful MRI analysis of all those tumor - free rats showed no sign of damage related to necrosis , edema , infection or trauma ...
We also examined other potential side effects of cannabinoid administration .
In both tumor - free and tumor - bearing rats , cannabinoid administration induced no substantial change in behavioral parameters such as motor coordination or physical activity .
Food and water intake , as well as body weight gain , were unaffected during and after cannabinoid delivery .
Likewise , the general hematological profiles of cannabinoid - treated rats were normal .
Thus , neither biochemical parameters nor markers of tissue damage changed substantially during the seven - day delivery period or for at least two months after cannabinoid treatment ended . "
Guzman 's investigation is the only time since the 1974 Virginia study that THC has been administered to live , tumor - bearing animals .
( The Spanish researchers cite a 1998 study in which cannabinoids inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation , but that was a " petri dish " experiment that did n't involve live subjects . )
In an e-mail interview for this story , the Madrid researcher said he had heard of the Virginia study , but had never been able to locate literature on it .
Hence , the Nature Medicine article characterizes the new study as the first on tumor - laden animals and does n't cite the 1974 Virginia investigation .
" I am aware of the existence of that research .
In fact I have attempted many times to obtain the journal article on the original investigation by these people , but it has proven impossible , " Guzman said .
In 1983 , the Reagan / Bush Administration tried to persuade American universities and researchers to destroy all 1966 - 76 cannabis research work , including compendiums in libraries , reports Jack Herer , who states , " We know that large amounts of information have since disappeared . "
Guzman provided the title of the work -- " Antineoplastic activity of cannabinoids , " an article in a 1975 Journal of the National Cancer Institute -- and this writer obtained a copy at the University of California medical school library in Davis and faxed it to Madrid .
The summary of the Virginia study begins , " Lewis lung adenocarcinoma growth was retarded by the oral administration of tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) and cannabinol ( CBN ) " -- two types of cannabinoids , a family of active components in marijuana .
" Mice treated for 20 consecutive days with THC and CBN had reduced primary tumor size . "
The 1975 journal article does n't mention breast cancer tumors , which are featured in the only newspaper story ever to appear about the 1974 study -- in the " Local " section of The Washington Post on Aug. 18 , 1974 .
Under the headline , " Cancer Curb Is Studied , " it read in part :
" The active chemical agent in marijuana curbs the growth of three kinds of cancer in mice and may also suppress the immunity reaction that causes rejection of organ transplants , a Medical College of Virginia team has discovered . "
The researchers " found that THC slowed the growth of lung cancers , breast cancers , and a virus - induced leukemia in laboratory mice , and prolonged their lives by as much as 36 percent . "
Guzman , writing from Madrid , was eloquent in his response after this writer faxed him the clipping from The Washington Post of a quarter century ago .
In translation , he wrote :
" It is extremely interesting to me , the hope that the project seemed to awaken at that moment , and the sad evolution of events during the years following the discovery , until now we once again draw back the veil , over the anti-tumoral power of THC , 25 years later .
Unfortunately , the world bumps along between such moments of hope and long periods of intellectual castration . "
News coverage of the Madrid discovery has been virtually nonexistent in this country .
The news broke quietly on Feb. 29 , 2000 with a story that ran once on the UPI wire about the Nature Medicine article .
This writer stumbled on it through a link that appeared briefly on the Drudge Report Web page .
The New York Times , The Washington Post , and Los Angeles Times all ignored the story , even though its newsworthiness is indisputable : a benign substance occurring in nature destroys deadly brain tumors .

So began the longest and most terrifying two hours of Mr Wheatley 's life : the bite detonated a storm inside his nervous system , one which sent his heart into overdrive , doubled his blood pressure , unleashed wavelets of violent , involuntary twitches over his arms , stood his body hair on end and caused his lungs to stiffen and well with yellow foam .
But the events of that dramatic night 25 years ago did not end with an agonising death .
Instead , Mr Wheatley made medical history , becoming the first human to receive an experimental antidote to the ferocious Atrax robustus , the Sydney funnel - web .
His survival ended a reign of terror in the city 's gardens , in which the world 's most venomous spider killed 13 NSW citizens , many of them children .
Indeed , the last fatality occurred exactly 12 months earlier when a curly - headed blond toddler , James Cully , was bitten while on holidays on the Central Coast .
Mr Wheatley , however , was lucky from the word go .
His neighbour , a GP , was not only home but awake on that fateful night and raced over to wrap his foot in a compression bandage , at the time a new first aid response .
" I do n't remember much after getting into the car but I do remember saying to my son that he should slow down , " says Mr Wheatley .
" The last thing I heard was our next - door neighbour say , ' No , just go like hell . '
It was then I knew how serious it was . "
They made it to Ryde Hospital inside 15 minutes .
Sweating rivers , Mr Wheatley was complaining of palpitations but soon registered a pulse rate of 100 beats a minute .
As doctors set up an intravenous line , they noted the twitching in his arms was progressing to muscle spasm .
Tears and saliva began to pour out of his body , his complexion turned blue and his lungs began to well with froth : " I was drowning in my own fluids . "
As he thrashed for oxygen in desperation , he pulled out his intravenous line and could n't keep an oxygen mask on .
A decision was made to sedate , paralyse and rush him by ambulance to Royal North Shore Hospital where , by another stroke of luck , Dr Malcolm Fisher - now a professor and a world - renowned intensive - care specialist - was on duty .
Gwen
Wheatley , who was following in a car , remembers seeing the ambulance tear past but says she still had not registered just how close she was to losing her husband : " As soon as I got to hospital , I had to give all this information and was thinking , ' This is strange .
Why can't I see him ? '
Then Dr Fisher explained there was an anti-venom and that Gordon may be the first [ human ] patient to receive it .
They needed my permission …
They did n't know what side effects there might be .
" I asked him , ' What would you do ? ' and he said , ' I 'd use it . ' " Minutes later Mr Wheatley - whose heart rate was now 155 beats a minute - was injected with the first ampoule .
Nothing happened .
A second was injected minutes later and a desperate third , too .
At 1.30 am and in utter frustration , Dr Fisher - famous even then for his earthy language - rang the Melbourne home of Dr Struan Sutherland , the biggest hero in the spider - men story .
The world - renowned venom expert and research scientist had devoted a frustrating 15 years of his life in the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories working on a funnel - web anti-venom .
With the help of the Worrell family and its Gosford reptile park - who devised a technique to milk spiders for their venom - he experimented day and night , often battling an unhelpful bureaucracy and funding cuts .
It was not until July 1980 , just six months before Mr Wheatley was bitten , that Dr Sutherland proved his antivenom reversed poisoning in monkeys , the only other mammal affected by funnel - web venom .
That October the Medical Journal of Australia published three papers on the venom , the antivenom and bite treatments , and the first batch of the antivenom was approved for manufacture and clinical trial just 30 days before Mr Wheatley was bitten .
Dr Fisher remembers that night clearly : " Struan reckoned my words were , ' I 've given him three ampoules of the stuff … It has n't killed him but it has n't done him any good either , ' " he told the Herald .
" I actually said , ' This f--- ing stuff does n't f--- ing work . '
Struan answered that if it had n't killed him to just give him some more because we just did n't know how much he might need . "
An elated Fisher was soon back on the phone to Sutherland : " I gave him another and he was better in an hour .
I said to Struan , ' You 've ruined a beautiful bloody syndrome . '
" Later we took the tube out , kept him overnight and he went home the next day . "
The doctors ' actions appear brutal in retrospect but the truth is , in the early days of what is now the high - tech intensive - care specialty , treatment was often experimental , risky and provided under extenuating , last - ditch circumstances .
Medical leaps were made simply trying and testing new techniques to sustain the human body through the worst of dire illnesses or trauma .
If they worked they would be written up and applied again and again .
That night a confluence of science and pioneering medical techniques hit paydirt .
A systematic review of data published in February by the Medical Journal of Australia identified 198 cases in which potential funnel - web spider bites were documented .
It found no confirmed deaths after the antivenom was introduced and a complete reversal of severe poisoning in 97 per cent of cases .
After his brush with death , the Wheatleys spent another 1½ years in Sydney before retiring to the South Coast .
" I rang Struan just a couple of years before he died , " said Mr Wheatley .
" It had been 20 years and I said , ' Hello , it 's Gordon Wheatley . '
Without a pause , he said , ' Well how the bloody hell are you ? ' "
WASHINGTON -- A US grand jury in Guam opened an investigation of controversial lobbyist Jack Abramoff more than two years ago , but President Bush removed the supervising federal prosecutor , and the probe ended soon after .
The previously undisclosed Guam inquiry is separate from a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia that is investigating allegations that Abramoff bilked Indian tribes out of millions of dollars .
In Guam , a US territory in the Pacific , investigators were looking into Abramoff 's secret arrangement with Superior Court officials to lobby against a court reform bill then pending in Congress .
The legislation , since approved , gave the Guam Supreme Court authority over the Superior Court .
In 2002 , Abramoff was retained by the Superior Court in what was an unusual arrangement for a public agency .
The Los Angeles Times reported in May that Abramoff was paid with a series of $ 9,000 checks funneled through a Laguna Beach , Calif. , lawyer to disguise the lobbyist 's role working for the Guam court .
No separate contract was authorized for Abramoff 's work .
Guam court officials have never explained the contractual arrangement .
At the time , Abramoff was a well - known lobbying figure in the Pacific islands because of his work for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and Saipan garment manufacturers , accused of employing workers in what critics called sweatshop conditions .
Abramoff spokesman Andrew Blum said the lobbyist '' has no recollection of his being investigated in Guam in 2002 .
If he had been aware of an investigation , he would have cooperated fully . "
Blum declined to respond to detailed questions .
The transactions were the target of a grand jury subpoena issued Nov. 18 , 2002 , according to the subpoena .
It demanded that Anthony Sanchez , administrative director of the Guam Superior Court , turn over all records involving the lobbying contract , including bills and payments .
A day later , the chief prosecutor , US Attorney Frederick A. Black , who had launched the investigation , was demoted .
A White House news release announced that Bush was replacing Black .
The timing caught some by surprise .
Despite his officially temporary status as the acting US attorney , Black had held the assignment for more than a decade .
The acting US attorney was a controversial official in Guam .
At the time he was replaced , Black was directing a long - term investigation into allegations of public corruption in the administration of then - Governor Carl Gutierrez .
The probe produced numerous indictments , including some of the governor 's political associates and top aides .
Black , 56 , had served as acting US attorney for Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands since 1991 , when he was named to the post by the president 's father , President George H. W. Bush .
The career prosecutor , who held a senior position as first assistant before accepting the acting US attorney job , was demoted to a staff post .
Black 's demotion came after an intensive lobbying effort by supporters of Gutierrez , who had been publicly critical of Black and his investigative efforts .
Black declined to comment for this article .
His replacement , Leonardo Rapadas , was confirmed in May 2003 without any debate .
Rapadas had been recommended for the job by the Guam Republican Party .
Fred Radewagen , a lobbyist who had been under contract to the Gutierrez administration , said he carried that recommendation to top Bush aide Karl Rove in early 2003 .
After taking office , Rapadas recused himself from the public corruption case involving Gutierrez .
The new US attorney was a cousin of '' one of the main targets , " according to a confidential memo to Justice Department officials .
Rapadas declined to comment and referred questions about his recusal to Justice Department officials who did not respond to requests for comment .

Kevin Drum summarized the White House ’s principal political problem with the purge scandal extremely well today .
They ’ve now had nearly two months to come up with a simple , clear , understandable explanation for why they chose those eight to fire but not the others .
So what is it ?
And why has it taken such an interminable amount of internal chaos to come up with something ?
People are n’t stupid .
If there were a simple , innocent explanation we would have heard it in January .
The fact that the president of the United States held a press conference eight weeks after this issue first hit the media and still did n’t have a plausible story to tell suggests pretty strongly that there is no plausible story to tell .
It ’s an important point about this scandal , which is probably helping drive the media ’s interest .
The White House , and its vaunted communications office , has had eight weeks to come up with a plausible explanation .
What have we heard ?
The Bush gang said a purge like this is normal and routine .
It was n’t .
They said Clinton did the same thing .
He did n’t .
They said the U.S. Attorneys serve at the pleasure of the president , which is true , but does n’t offer any substantive explanation why these specific U.S. Attorneys had to go .
They could n’t decide whether ( and which ) prosecutors were actually bad at their jobs .
They ca n’t explain why Justice Department officials lied to Congress .
They ca n’t explain why White House officials can’t testify under oath .
They ca n’t explain what role the president had in the firings .
They ca n’t explain what role the Attorney General had in the firings .
They ca n’t explain the meaning of the phrase “ loyal Bushies . ”
They ca n’t explain the 18 - day document gap .
They ca n’t explain why they ca n’t explain .
As Kevin said , if there was a reasonable explanation for this , we would have heard it by now .
The fact that we have n’t says a great deal .

Making fun of the president is not ideological .
Not making fun of the president , on the other hand , is .
And that ’s what distinguishes “ The ½ Hour News Hour , ” a Fox News version of “ The Daily Show With Jon Stewart , ” from most other satirical shows .
Comedians like Mr. Stewart , Stephen Colbert , Jay Leno and David Letterman ridicule whoever is in power , be it Bill Clinton or President Bush , John McCain or Nancy Pelosi .
The Fox News comedy only leans on the left .
On a mock news program much like “ Weekend Update ” on “ Saturday Night Live , ” the targets are Hillary Rodham Clinton , Barack Obama , global warming , Hollywood liberals , politically correct children ’s books ( “ Harry Potter and the Alternative Lifestyle ” ) and the American Civil Liberties Union .
A few riffs by the fake anchors , Kurt McNally ( Kurt Long ) and Jennifer Lange ( Jennifer Robertson ) , are funny , yet others fall flat .
But strangely , given the current wealth of material , there are no jokes about Mr. Bush , Dick Cheney or I. Lewis Libby Jr.
Sometimes the humor is so heavy - handed that it seems almost like self - parody .
The premiere tomorrow opens with Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter in a skit set in January 2009 .
Mr. Limbaugh is the newly elected commander in chief , and he tells his fellow Americans that his Democratic opponent , Howard Dean , is “ finally getting the medical attention he has so desperately needed for so long , ” which is a strange joke for Mr. Limbaugh to make , given his history of pain killers and prescription fraud .
It is fashionable in the venture capital business to hate Sarbanes Oxley , aka SOX .
Most every VC I know of thinks it is bad for the VC business .
Maybe it is .
It certainly makes it harder to take companies public .
And there is so much work that has to be done by a company to become " SOX compliant " , particularly section 404 compliant , that many companies can't even think about taking that on while trying to grow their business .
Brad
Feld got me thinking about this issue this morning with his post and link to Niel Robertson 's post on how to automate SOX 404 compliance .
I believe that before SOX , way too many companies went public before they were ready to be public companies .
They did n't have profits , they did n't have financial organizations capable of building and mantaining internal controls , they did n't have complete management teams , and they often did n't even have reality tested business models .
And once one company in a sector went public , they all went public , driven by a desire to maintain a level playing field with their competition .
Chapter Two of Hackoff.com has a good description of those days .
I recall the late 90s when companies would hire the CFO weeks before the IPO road show .
I recall that happening with a few CEOs as well .
It was crazy .
And it 's no wonder that so many of those companies ended up being bad public companies .
With SOX , that really can't happen .
It takes a year or longer to prepare to become a public company .
We have several companies in the Flatiron portfolio that are going through this process now .
And as much as I hate seeing them spend the money on SOX consultants and staffing up their finance departments , I see it as an important test of whether the company really wants to be a public company or not .
There are plenty of ways to raise capital privately so the public markets are n't always the best option for raising capital , particularly for young companies .
And the M&A market is very healthy , so going public is n't necessarily the best way for the insiders to get liquid on their investment .
The investment banks are supposed to be the gatekeepers of the IPO process , deciding which companies are ready to go public and which are not .
Back in the day when they really " underwrote " the public offerings and took the risk on whether the deals got done or not , maybe they did provide some kind of readiness filter , but I do n't think that investment banks can be relied upon to be the quality filters anymore .
They make too much money on the IPOs , regardless of whether they are successful public companies , to be truly objective about the process .
So I think its a great thing that SOX has put a high hurdle that companies need to jump over to become public .
In the past four years , we have seen that good companies can go public , but it takes a lot of work and preparation to do that .
My friends at Broadview ( now part of Jeffries & Company ) used to have a chart of the performance of venture backed IPOs six and twelve months post IPO .
A sizable majority of them were trading below their offering price by the time that the VCs could get out .
They made a persuasive , if somewhat self serving , argument that selling venture backed companies provided better exits than IPOs .
I 've often felt that was true for all but the very best portfolio companies .
Now with SOX we have a hurdle that forces entrepreneurs and VCs to be patient and prepared for the IPO process .
I 'd be interested to see that Broadview chart pre and post SOX .
I bet it looks better now .
Here ’s a new word for you : obsolagnium .
You may not find it in an ordinary dictionary .
But if you are over 50 , you may well be familiar with the concept , because it means “ waning sexual desire resulting from age . ”
In fact , it is rarely age per se that accounts for declines in libido among those in the second half - century of life .
Rather , it can be any of a dozen or more factors more common in older people that account for the changes .
Many of these factors are subject to modification that can restore , if not the sexual energy of youth , at least the desire to seek and the ability to enjoy sex .
Nor is it just hormones .
Addressing only the distaff half of the population , the Boston Women ’s Health Book Collective , in its newest work , “ Our Bodies , Ourselves : Menopause , ” points out : “ Our sexual desire and satisfaction may be influenced by our life circumstances , including the quality of our sexual relationships , our emotional and physical health , and our values and thoughts about sexuality , as well as by the aging process and the shifting hormone levels that occur during the menopause transition . ”
The same , of course , is true of men .
Difficult life circumstances can do much to dampen anyone ’s libido .
Stress at work or home , looming bankruptcy , impending divorce , serious illness , depression , a history of sexual abuse and a host of medications are among the many things that can put a big crimp in your desire for sex at any age .
We were told that the Iraqis do n't count .
Before the invasion began , the head of US central command , General Thomas Franks , boasted that " we do n't do body counts " .
His claim was repeated by Donald Rumsfeld in November 2003 ( " We do n't do body counts on other people " ) and the Pentagon last January ( " The only thing we keep track of is casualties for US troops and civilians " ) .
But it 's not true .
Almost every week the Pentagon claims to have killed 50 or 70 or 100 insurgents in its latest assault on the latest stronghold of the ubiquitous monster Zarqawi .
In May the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said that his soldiers had killed 250 of Zarqawi's " closest lieutenants " ( or so 500 of his best friends had told him ) .
But last week , the Pentagon did something new .
Buried in its latest security report to Congress is a bar chart labelled " average daily casualties - Iraqi and coalition .
1 Jan 04 - 16 Sep 05 " .
The claim that it kept no track of Iraqi deaths was false .
The report does not explain what it means by casualty , or if its figures represent all casualties , only insurgents , or , as the foregoing paragraph appears to hint , only civilians killed by insurgents .
There is no explanation of how the figures were gathered or compiled .
The only accompanying text consists of the words " Source : MNC - I " , which means Multi- National Corps - Iraq .
We 'll just have to trust them .
What the chart shows is that these unexplained casualties have more than doubled since the beginning of the Pentagon 's survey .
From January to March 2004 , 26 units of something or other were happening every day , while in September 2005 the something or other rose to 64 .
But whatever it is that 's been rising , the weird morality of this war dictates that it is reported as good news .
Journalists have been multiplying the daily average of mystery units by the number of days , discovering that the figure is lower than previous estimates of Iraqi deaths , and using it to cast doubts on them .
As ever , the study in the line of fire is the report published by the Lancet in October last year .
It was a household survey - of 988 homes in 33 randomly selected districts - and it suggested , on the basis of the mortality those households reported before and after the invasion , that the risk of death in Iraq had risen by a factor of 1.5 ; somewhere between 8,000 and 194,000 extra people had died , with the most probable figure being 98,000 .
Around half the deaths , if Falluja was included , or 15 % if it was not , were caused by violence , and the majority of those by attacks on the part of US forces .
In the US and the UK , the study was either ignored or torn to bits .
The media described it as " inflated " , " overstated " , " politicised " and " out of proportion " .
Just about every possible misunderstanding and distortion of its statistics was published , of which the most remarkable was the Observer 's claim that : " The report 's authors admit it drew heavily on the rebel stronghold of Falluja , which has been plagued by fierce fighting .
Strip out Falluja , as the study itself acknowledged , and the mortality rate is reduced dramatically . "
In fact , as they made clear on page one , the authors had stripped out Falluja ; their estimate of 98,000 deaths would otherwise have been much higher .
But the attacks in the press succeeded in sinking the study .
Now , whenever a newspaper or broadcaster produces an estimate of civilian deaths , the Lancet report is passed over in favour of lesser figures .
For the past three months , the editors and subscribers of the website Medialens have been writing to papers and broadcasters to try to find out why .
The standard response , exemplified by a letter from the BBC 's online news service last week , is that the study 's " technique of sampling and extrapolating from samples has been criticised " .
That 's true , and by the same reasoning we could dismiss the fact that 6 million people were killed in the Holocaust , on the grounds that this figure has also been criticised , albeit by skinheads .
The issue is not whether the study has been criticised , but whether the criticism is valid .
As Medialens has pointed out , it was the same lead author , using the same techniques , who reported that 1.7 million people had died as a result of conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
That finding has been cited by Tony Blair , Colin Powell and almost every major newspaper on both sides of the Atlantic , and none has challenged either the method or the result .
Using the Congo study as justification , the UN security council called for all foreign armies to leave the DRC and doubled the country 's UN aid budget .
The other reason the press gives for burying the Lancet study is that it is out of line with competing estimates .
Like Jack Straw , wriggling his way around the figures in a written ministerial statement , they compare it to the statistics compiled by the Iraqi health ministry and the website Iraq Body Count .
In December 2003 , Associated Press reported that " Iraq 's health ministry has ordered a halt to a count of civilians killed during the war " .
According to the head of the ministry 's statistics department , both the puppet government and the Coalition Provisional Authority demanded that it be stopped .
As Naomi Klein has shown on these pages , when US soldiers stormed Falluja ( a year ago today ) , their first action was to seize the general hospital and arrest the doctors .
The New York Times reported that " the hospital was selected as an early target because the American military believed that it was the source of rumours about heavy casualties " .
After the coalition had used these novel statistical methods to improve the results , Blair told parliament that " figures from the Iraqi ministry of health , which are a survey from the hospitals there , are in our view the most accurate survey there is " .
Iraq Body Count , whose tally has reached 26,000 - 30,000 , measures only civilian deaths which can be unambiguously attributed to the invasion and which have been reported by two independent news agencies .
As the compilers point out , " it is likely that many if not most civilian casualties will go unreported by the media ... our own total is certain to be an underestimate of the true position , because of gaps in reporting or recording " .
Of the seven mortality reports surveyed by the Overseas Development Institute , the estimate in the Lancet 's paper was only the third highest .
It remains the most thorough study published so far .
Extraordinary as its numbers seem , they are the most likely to be true .
And what of the idea that most of the violent deaths in Iraq are caused by coalition troops ?
Well according to the Houston Chronicle , even Blair 's favourite data source , the Iraqi health ministry , reports that twice as many Iraqis - and most of them civilians - are being killed by US and UK forces as by insurgents .
When the Pentagon claims that it has just killed 50 or 70 or 100 rebel fighters , we have no means of knowing who those people really were .
Everyone it blows to pieces becomes a terrorist .
In July Jack Keane , the former vice chief of staff of the US army , claimed that coalition troops had killed or captured more than 50,000 " insurgents " since the start of the rebellion .
Perhaps they were all Zarqawi's closest lieutenants .
We can expect the US and UK governments to seek to minimise the extent of their war crimes .
But it 's time the media stopped collaborating .

‘ WKRP in Cincinnati ’ finally arrives on DVD … sorta
I think it ’s safe to say that no one has ever expected the classic ’ 70s sitcom WKRP in Cincinnati to get a DVD release , no matter how fans have been yammering for it .
This series has been the poster child for an issue that has been dogging home video since the beginning .
See , music rights for anything predating VHS and DVD were negotiated for broadcast only — no one foresaw the advent of the new formats , and why should they have ? — so that now , when a studio wants to do a DVD release of , say , a sitcom about a rock radio station that features jokes built around popular tunes of the time , all those music rights need to be renegotiated .
And for a show like this , with countless music cues and now - expensive - to - license rock classics constantly playing in the background , and often absolutely essential to the plot or the humor , those rights would add up to something like the GNP of a small African nation .
Which would reduce any profit to be made on the DVD set in the first place .
So I was stunned when WKRP in Cincinnati : The Complete First Season arrived in my mailbox .
The holy grail of DVD !
But wait .
What ’s the little note on the back of the set ?
“ Some of the original musical content has been edited for this DVD release . ”
And it ’s more than merely “ some ” — lots of the music that originally helped create the show ’s atmosphere is gone .
( Pop culture blogger Jaime J. Weinman has compiled an exhaustive list of all the music changes , and it ai n’t pretty . )
Some fans are calling it a “ travesty . ”
I was never a fan of the show so I ’m not the person to weigh in on this , but it does seem like the show has been gutted .
Serious WKRPers can consider themselves warned : buy this DVD at your own risk of disappointment .

What the hell is Blub ?
I take from context that it may be a pejorative generalist term for programming languages that encourage writing pablum instead of programs .
Or maybe it really is a new language out there that has a huge following I 'm unaware of .

Blub Paradox
Blub falls right in the middle of the abstractness continuum ...
As long as our hypothetical Blub programmer is looking down the power continuum , he knows he 's looking down .
Languages less powerful than Blub are obviously less powerful , because they 're missing some feature he 's used to .
But when our hypothetical Blub programmer looks in the other direction , up the power continuum , he does n't realize he 's looking up .
What he sees are merely weird languages ...
Blub is good enough for him , because he thinks in Blub .

Programming consists of overcoming two things : accidental difficulties , things which are difficult because you happen to be using inadequate programming tools , and things which are actually difficult , which no programming tool or language is going to solve .
How do we know which things are accidentally difficult and which are actually difficult
From time to time I open my email and find someone asking a question : Actually , Blub is a hypothetical programming language Paul Graham invented when describing something very interesting : the The interesting things about this paradox is that almostlanguage could be Blub .
The pre-requisites for a language being Blub are ( a ) there is at least one language less powerful than Blub , ( b ) there is at least one languagepowerful than Blub , and ( c ) that there be at least one programmer using Blub who accepts ( a ) but refutes ( b ) because he or she cannot see how the more powerful language is more powerful .
She does not think in the idioms that the more powerful language affords .
Whenuse the term , I am thinking of the language and also the programmers around it .
Could Java be Blub ?
Sometimes , possibly often , but only when I 'm thinking about Java programmers who dismiss Ruby 's features as unnecessary .
Could Ruby be Blub ?
Sometimes , but only when I 'm thinking about Ruby programmers who dismiss macros as unimportant .
Could Lisp be Blub ?
I suspect that Erlang and Haskell programmers might say that it is , provided we can find a Lisp programmer who feels that all progress in programming languages stopped when Common Lisp was standardized .
At the same time , Java is not Blub when I am thinking of programmers who are perfectly aware of its shortcomings and deliberately Greenspun around them for pragmatic reasons .
The same goes for any other language : it is sometimes Blub , and sometimes not Blub .
So ... I use the term " Blub " to refer to a programming language in the context of intransigent programmers who feel that their chosen tool is the best tool possible .
This provokes a very obvious question :?
Is it only because we have n't discovered the right tool yet ?
It 's easy to find a Java programmer who believes that all of the Design Patterns in the GoF 's book are necessary .
She believes that the difficulties of applying those patterns are actual difficulties of programming systems .
It is only when she learns a different language that she realizes how the patterns were strongly driven by limitations in Java 's object model .
At that point she has an epiphany and understands that what she thought were actual difficulties were merely accidental difficulties .
And the line between " accidental " and " actual " moves for her .
No matter how much each us us thinks we know right now , are we nevertheless like this Java programmer , unable to see the difference between accidental and actual differences because we simply have n't discovered a more powerful tool ?
Are we Blub programmers ?

Failure to innovate will cost companies more than just revenue .
It has the potential of permanently surrendering market share and perception in consumers
The news today is grim on several fronts , as recession fears continue to grip world markets .
If plunging markets and an economic slowdown were n’t bad enough , it became official that General Motors is no longer the world ’s largest auto manufacturer .
While it has n’t lost the title entirely , its new sales data shows it ’s in a dead heat with Toyota .
Odds are , as many industry analysts have predicted over the past several years , Toyota will overtake GM and retain the new leadership mantle with ease .
At the same time , Apple ’s financial data shows iPod sales slowed .
While the company famous for its Mac computers and the iPhone sold more of the personal music players in the last quarter than ever before , the increase in year - over - year sales slow to its lowest point since the gadget was introduced five years ago .
Part of what ’s behind the rise — and fall — of these giants is innovation and the failure to keep innovating .
GM built its business on a tried - and - true model of fixed obsolescence .
Like most carmakers , GM ’s cars and trucks have an average lifespan of about five years ( coincidentally , the same time as most car loans ) .
Each year , it releases new models with modified designs , features and performance standards .
The idea is to entice people to churn their cars in favor of more stylish vehicles with new , previously unavailable features .
Guess what ?
We saw the same thing with the iPod .
The iPod Apple sold over the holidays is hardly the same as the brick it introduced in 2002 .
For roughly $ 200 , you could get a new 8 GB iPod Nano with a solid - state hard drive , color screen , video capabilities and a host of new features like games and whiz - bang graphics that were previously unavailable .
Sitting alongside the Nano on the store shelf was the “ classic ” iPod .
For just $ 150 more , you could get 80 GB of memory and video , but it ’s also three times the size and has none of the new features .
For the same money as the Nano and $ 100 less than the iTouch ( basically a iPhone sans phone ) , gadget buyers could get a Microsoft Zune .
Larger than a Nano and with a screen even larger than the Classic , Zune outsold iPod for the first time over the holidays .
This leap happened because the iPod started pushing market saturation and its competitors finally started offering products that either rival or exceed the iPod ’s novelty .
Same thing happened with GM , Ford and Chrysler .
They believed consumers would continue to accept multiple brands with lackluster performance and features , and homogenized designs because they owned the market .
Their failure to recognize that better quality , performance and features would allow foreign competitors to undermine their market was one of their biggest mistakes .
Despite critics ’ praise for the quality and design of GM ’s 2008 line , consumers do n’t care .
The carmakers reputation is so sullied by countless gaffes of the past that it ’s difficult to turn around poor perceptions .
The primary factor keeping GM in the game is deep discounts and incentives .
Microsoft faced a similar problem in 2001 following a devastating string of malware outbreaks that compromised tens of millions of networks and machines around the world .
In response , it launched its Trustworthy Computing Initiative to clean up its source code and improve the security of its products .
Six years later , Microsoft ’s security has improved — although there are still plenty of problems and vulnerabilities — but it still battles the perception of having poor security .
No one is saying the iPod is dead or dying , but it may have peaked .
So it ’s no surprise that Apple is pushing into new markets — the iPhone , on - demand video rentals , Apple TV and , surprisingly , personal computers .
GM and other American carmakers are leveraging new technology — voice - activated audio systems , new safety features , alternative fuels — to revive their lines .
While some of this is innovative , it ’s difficult to predict if it will have an impact on shoring up eroding marketshare .

The politics of drugs is often seen as a battle between the prohibitionists and the liberalisers .
But after two years study and reflection , the RSA Commission on Illegal Drugs calls for a quite different approach - a strategy based on reducing harm .
The report makes the point that , as with alcohol , the majority of those who use illegal drugs do so without causing significant harm to themselves or others .
The commission report makes it clear that while there are many instances of relatively harmless drug use , " there is no such thing as risk - free use of either drugs or alcohol - or tobacco come to that . "
Is drug taking a similar habit to smoking ?
Call for drug law overhaul
The conclusion is that we need to have the same approach to drugs like alcohol and tobacco as we do with those drugs which , often by an accident of history , are illegal .
Instead of a classification of drugs which is " crude , ineffective , riddled with anomalies and open to political manipulation " , there should be an index of substance - related harms - physical , social and economic .
Drugs policy outcomes should be judged in terms of harms reduced rather than drugs seized or offenders prosecuted , the commission says .
' A more enlightened attitude '
So what would such a policy actually look like on the ground ?
The commission shies away from defining its " harm index " , but it does spend some time assessing the harms caused by different drugs .
Heroin is " the most physically dangerous of drugs " , says the commission .
However , it points out that " even heroin use can sometimes be kept within bounds . "
It quotes a report from a team at Glasgow Caledonian University in 2005 which followed 126 long - term heroin users and revealed that more than half were in a stable relationship , a third had children and most had settled accommodation and were in employment or further education .
More people are harmed by alcohol and tobacco than by currently illegal drugs
RSA Commission on Illegal Drugs
The report assesses other drugs too .
It says : " Many adult cannabis users work out for themselves precisely when , where , how much and how often they use cannabis so that it does not dislocate their daily routines .
" Cocaine use too can be controlled within a secure social setting .
" Where the lives of cocaine users begin to come apart , the problem may in the end be found to be with their daily lives rather than with the cocaine . "
A cool response
The commission recommends that the use of criminal sanctions should be confined to the punishment of those offences connected with drugs that cause the most harm .
But the report does not say whether that means the authorities turning a blind eye to heroin or cocaine users whose habit is " controlled " .
Like many earnest and well - researched reports before it , the commission report calls for a more enlightened attitude towards drug use .
" More people are harmed by alcohol and tobacco than by currently illegal drugs .
" More people are killed every year by sniffing glue than by snorting cocaine .
Very many more people are killed in traffic accidents than by drug overdoses , " the commission says .
" It is necessary to be aware of the physical and psychological harms that individual drugs can inflict , but also to keep these harms , and our reaction to them , in proportion . "
However , politicians are giving the report a cool response .
All parties know the huge electoral damage that can follow any suggestion that they are " going soft " on drugs .

Different parts of the brain are activated by male and female voices A university research team says it has discovered why most people " hearing voices " in hallucinations say they hear male voices .
Dr Michael Hunter 's research at the University of Sheffield says that male voices are less complex to produce than female .
As such , when the brain spontaneously produces its own " voices " , a male voice is more likely to have been generated .
Among both men and women , 71 % of such " false " voices are male .
' False perception ' " Psychiatrists believe that these auditory hallucinations are caused when the brain spontaneously activates , creating a false perception of a voice , " says Professor Hunter of the university 's psychiatry department .
" The reason these voices are usually male could be explained by the fact that the female voice is so much more complex that the brain would find it much harder to create a false female voice accurately than a false male voice , " he says .
Such imaginary voices are typically likely to be middle - aged and carry " derogatory " messages .
The research , published in NeuroImage , shows how the brain interprets information from human voices - and how female and male voices activate different parts of the brain .
" The female voice is more complex than the male voice , due to differences in the size and shape of the vocal cords and larynx between women and men , and also due to women having greater natural ' melody ' in their voices .
" This causes a more complex range of sound frequencies than in a male voice , " says Professor Hunter .
These gender differences in voices trigger responses in different parts of brain - and as the male version is simpler , both men and women who hear voices , are on average more likely to produce a male - sounding voice .
The research says that " auditory verbal hallucinations " are a symptom of schizophrenia and " occur in 40 % to 60 % of patients who suffer from the condition " .

What are these ?
THERE is a cleft in a stone hill outside Qardho , in northern Somalia , which even the hardest gunmen and frankincense merchants avoid .
In the cool dark , out of the bleached sunshine , there is a pit , a kind of Alice in Wonderland rabbit hole , which is said to swirl down into the world of jinn .
Locals say jinn — genies , that is — fade in and out above the pit .
Sometimes they shift into forms of ostriches and run out over the desert scrub .
The Bible holds that God created angels and then made man in his own image .
The Koran states that Allah fashioned angels from light and then made jinn from smokeless fire .
Man was formed later , out of clay .
Jinn disappointed Allah , not least by climbing to the highest vaults of the sky and eavesdropping on the angels .
Yet Allah did not annihilate them .
No flood closed over their heads .
Jinn were willed into existence , like man , to worship Allah and were preserved on earth for that purpose , living in a parallel world , set at such an angle that jinn can see men , but men can not see jinn .
Less educated Muslims remain fearful of jinn .
Hardly a week passes in the Muslim world without a strange story concerning them .
Often the tales are foolish and melancholy .
In August , for instance , Muslims in the Kikandwa district of central Uganda grew feverish over reports of jinn haunting and raping women in the district .
So when a young woman stumbled out of the forest one day , unkempt and deranged , she was denounced as a jinn .
Villagers beat her almost to death .
Police finished the job with six bullets at close range .
The young woman called out for her children in her last moments .
An investigation revealed her to be from a neighbouring district .
She had spent days without food or water , searching for her missing husband .
Editorials in Ugandan newspapers called on the government formally to deny the existence of jinn .
That would be divisive .
Although a few Islamic scholars have over the ages denied the existence of jinn , the consensus is that good Muslims should believe in them .
Some Islamic jurists consider marriage between jinn and humans to be lawful .
There is a similar provision for the inheritance of jinn property .
Sex during menstruation is an invitation to jinn and can result in a woman bearing a jinn child .
According to the Koran , the Prophet Muhammad preached to bands of jinn .
Some converted to Islam .
This is how jinn describe their condition in the Koran :
And among us [ jinn ] there are righteous folk and among us there are those far from that .
We are sects , having different rules .
And we know that we cannot escape from Allah in the earth , nor can we escape by flight .
And when we heard the guidance [ of the Koran ] , we believed therein , and who so believeth in his Lord , he feareth neither loss nor oppression .
And there are among us some who have surrendered to Allah and there are among us some who are unjust .
In Somalia and Afghanistan clerics matter - of - factly described to your correspondent the range of jinn they had encountered , from the saintly to the demonic ; those that can fly , those that crawl , plodding jinn , invisible jinn , gul with vampiric tendencies ( from which the English word ghoul is taken ) , and shape - shifters recognisable in human form because their feet are turned backwards .
Occasionally the clerics fell into a trance .
Afterwards they claimed their apparently bare rooms had filled with jinn seeking favours or release from amulet charms .
A parallel universe
Although Somalia and Afghanistan have different religious traditions ( Somalia being more relaxed ) , jinn belief is strong in both countries .
War - ravaged , with similarly rudimentary education systems , both have a tradition of shrines venerating local saints where women can pray .
Women are supposed to be more open to jinn , particularly illiterate rural women : by some accounts education is a noise , a roaring of thought , which jinn cannot bear .
Sometimes women turn supposed jinn possession to their own advantage and become fortune - tellers .
Among the most popular questions asked of such women is : “ Will my husband take a second wife ? ”
The shrines are often little more than a carved niche in a rock , with colourful prayer flags tied to nearby trees .
Jinn are said to be attracted to the ancient geography of shrines , many of which predate Islam ; as some have it , the shrines were attracted to the jinn .
Islam teaches that jinn resemble men in many ways : they have free will , are mortal , face judgment and fill hell together .
Jinn and men marry , have children , eat , play , sleep and husband their own animals .
Islamic scholars are in disagreement over whether jinn are physical or insubstantial in their bodies .
Some clerics have described jinn as bestial , giant , hideous , hairy , ursine .
Supposed yeti sightings in Pakistan 's Chitral are believed by locals to be of jinn .
These kinds of jinn can be killed with date or plum stones fired from a sling .
Hardly a week passes in the Muslim world without a strange story concerning them .
Often the tales are foolish and melancholy
But to more scholarly clerics jinn are little more than an energy , a pulse form of quantum physics perhaps , alive at the margins of sleep or madness , and more often in the whispering of a single unwelcome thought .
An extension of this electric description of jinn is that they are not beings at all but thoughts that were in the world before the existence of man .
Jinn reflect the sensibilities of those imagining them , just as in Assyrian times they were taken to be the spirits responsible for manias , who melted into the light at dawn .
When a donkey brays
The English word genie , from an unrelated French root , is now too soft and gooey with Disney 's Aladdin to catch the acid qualities attributed to jinn .
Sepideh Azarbaijani-Moghaddam , a specialist on Afghanistan who has undertaken anthropological research on jinn belief , reckons she may once have been in the presence of jinn .
She was riding with others in the Afghan province of Badakhshan .
It was towards dusk .
They came down into a valley forested at the bottom .
The horses tensed .
“ Suddenly from out of the trees I felt myself being watched by non-human entities . ”
A cold fear overcame her , “ the fear of losing the faculty of reason ” .
A Kabul cleric describes this sort of feeling as a shock at the existence of otherness .
Animals sense it also : when a donkey brays , it is said to be seeing a jinn .
Unbelieving jinn , those who resisted the Koran , are shaytan , demons , “ firewood for hell ” .
Many Muslims see the devil as a jinn .
Some reckon the snake in the Garden of Eden was a shape - shifting jinn .
All this may yet play a part in the war on terrorism .
Factions in Somalia and Afghanistan have accused their enemies of being backed not only by the CIA but by malevolent jinn .
One theory in Afghanistan holds that the mujahideen , “ two - legged wolves ” , scared the jinn out into the world , causing disharmony .
It is jinn , they say , who whisper into the ears of suicide - bombers .
Sheikh Mubarak Ali Gilani , a Pakistani cleric connected with a jihadist group , Jamaat al - Fuqra , has given warning to America that its missiles will be misdirected by jinn .
It was all very different in the days of King Solomon , who was said to have had control over jinn and used them as masons in building the temple in Jerusalem .
The Jewish influence over jinn is strong .
It is probably no coincidence that the inscription on Aladdin 's lamp , which bound the jinn , was engraved with Hebraic characters .
Believers in abduction by aliens like to think jinn are aliens ; some of the more confrontational Muslim clerics dismiss claimed apparations of the Virgin Mary as the work of jinn .
The jinn demanded a cigarette , then another , and then it became impatient and swallowed lighted cigarettes whole
The story of Ahmed Shah Masoud , the commander of Afghanistan 's Northern Alliance , clearly shows up the link between jinn and myth - making .
Masoud resisted the Soviet Union and the Taliban from his base in the Panjshir valley until he was assassinated by al - Qaeda operatives on September 9th 2001 .
According to local legend , Muslim jinn were on his side .
One of his fighters was said to have slain a dragon in a mountain lake during the Soviet occupation and to have brought the dragon 's jewel to Masoud , with the help of Muslim jinn .
In murdering Masoud , some Panjshiris say , Osama bin Laden declared war on Muslim jinn also .
This is obvious , they say , from Mr bin Laden 's insistence on division and violence .
Your correspondent spent a night with Masoud 's former bodyguards in the Panjshir .
The men were employed to look after Masoud 's tomb .
His office was locked .
The bodyguards sat cross-legged on the floor of a room opposite .
A kerosene lantern flickered .
Machineguns were propped against the bed -rolls .
A few men went outside .
The first winter snow was falling on the jagged peaks that towered up on all sides .
It was fiercely cold .
A dog limped below , ears flat , tail between its legs .
It whimpered .
The men looked at the dog .
“ The jinn is still here , ” one said .
“ Bismillah , ” responded the others .
They pointed out jinn settlements just below the snow - line on the mountain slopes .
Inside , over plates of mutton and grey rice , tea , snuff and Korean cigarettes , they told the story of how the cook had been possessed by a jinn the week before .
He was a devout man , they said , a non-smoker and illiterate .
“ He fell ill .
When he recovered , he found he could speak and write in many languages .
The jinn that was in him was well - travelled but also pushy .
It demanded a cigarette , then another , and then it became impatient and swallowed lighted cigarettes whole . ”
In Somalia , the port of Bossaso is famous for its sorcerers .
Some of its ruling class claim to have intermarried with jinn long ago .
On a recent visit your correspondent was taken to a metal shed at the edge of a slum where jinn were supposed to be banished from taking human form .
The air inside the shed was thick with frankincense .
There was a man cloaked in red cloth kneeling on the ground .
A jinn was in him , a sorceress running the ceremony said , and indeed the man wore an eerie expression , as though a part of him was obscured .
Young men jumped up and down around him , chanting and beating drums .
The gunmen accompanying your correspondent were too scared to step into the shed .
Later , walking away from the shed in hot sunshine , one of the gunmen insisted that he could see a jinn scavenging for bones in the dirt .
There did not appear to be anything there .
A cloud of suspicion over the rest of Justice ’s decisions
Seeds of doubt abound .
Now that the nation has learned that several U.S. Attorneys were pressured to bring politically - charged cases for Republicans ’ benefit , and many of those who refused lost their jobs , it ’s inevitable that previous [ tag ] Justice Department [ / tag ] decisions will start to garner fresh scrutiny .
Paul Krugman noted a couple of weeks ago , for example , that Chris Christie , the former Bush “ Pioneer ” who is now the U.S. attorney for New Jersey , issued subpoenas as part of an investigation against Sen. Bob Menendez ( D ) shortly before last year ’s election .
This week , some Dems are looking further back .
( thanks to K.Z. for the tip )
New Hampshire Democrats say they will ask Congress to investigate whether prosecution of a Republican phone - jamming scheme on Election Day 2002 was intentionally delayed until after the presidential election two years later .
The furor over alleged political firings of eight federal prosecutors prompted the move , Kathy Sullivan , chairwoman of the state ’s Democratic Party , told The Associated Press Tuesday .
And why would n’t it ?
In 2002 , Republicans hired a telemarketing firm to jam the phone lines at the Democratic Party and the Manchester firefighters union , a nonpartisan group offering rides to the polls on Election Day , in order to disrupt get - out - the - vote efforts .
The scandal resulted in four criminal convictions , but James Tobin , New England chairman of Bush ’s campaign in 2004 , was not indicted until a month after Bush won a second term .
“ Why did it take so long for the indictment against Mr. Tobin to be brought ? ” Sullivan asked .
“ His name was apparently out there and known to the Department of Justice for several months and yet nothing was done with him until after the 2004 election . ”
Did politics play a role in the delayed indictment ?
I have no idea , but benefit of the doubt has gone out the window .
Every suspicious indictment and investigation suddenly deserves scrutiny .
And it ’s getting it .
* Did the U.S. Attorney ’s office in Pennsylvania intentionally target Bob Casey allies to undermine his Senate campaign against Rick Santorum ?
* Why was the career U.S. Attorney in Guam removed in 2002 after he started investigating disgraced GOP lobbyist Jack Abramoff ?
* Why has Western Pennsylvania ’s U.S. attorney , Mary Beth Buchanan , spent a disproportionate amount of her time launching public - corruption investigations against Democrats , while overlooking Republicans ?
* In July 2005 , the [ tag ] U.S. Attorney [ / tag ] in Denver decided not to pursue a matter in which bouncers at a Bush event impersonated Secret Service agents to throw out three law - abiding ticket - holders because of their bumper sticker ( the Denver Three controversy ) .
Did politics dictate the decision ?
As Bud Cummins , one of the purged prosecutors , explained :
“ [ T ] he public must perceive that every substantive decision within the department is made in a neutral and non-partisan fashion .
Once the public detects partisanship in one important decision , they will follow the natural inclination to question every decision made , whether there is a connection or not . ”
Exactly . [ tag ] Bush [ / tag ] administration officials may have obstructed justice , politicized federal prosecutors , and lied to Congress , but let ’s not overlook the fact that they also undermined the public ’s confidence in the justice system , as well .
There are lots of fake disputes over global climate change .
Does carbon dioxide in the atmosphere act like a giant blanket warming the earth ?
( Yes . )
Does uncertainty about global warming mean that we should delay action ?
( No . )
Should we be spending a much bigger fortune than we are on research : research into carbon - neutral power technologies , research into carbon - sequestration technologies , research into albedo - increasing technologies ?
( Yes . )
Should India , China , and company have to bear a substantial part of the medium - term burden ?
( No : the rich countries got to take an easy carbon emissions - intensive path to industrialization and riches ; theirs is the medium - term responsibility for dealing with the problem . )
Should we be building or blocking the formation of the international institutions that will manage our reactions to global climate change over the next several centuries ?
( The first . )
There is , however , one real dispute : what else , besides research , should we be doing over the next decade or two ?
We economists like to think of things in terms of prices .
And when we economists see something going wrong in the sense of having destructive side - effects , we like to tax it .
Taxing it makes the individuals who are undertaking actions feel in their wallets the destruction they are causing elsewhere .
Maybe the action is still worth doing , and maybe not .
Imposing a tax -- imposing the right tax -- on those who are , say , driving low - mileage SUVs is a way of harnessing the collective intelligence of humanity to deciding in which case the bad side - effects are a reason to stop .
But it needs to be the right tax .
An SUV going ten miles in the city and burning a gallon of gasoline pumps about 3 kilograms -- 6.5 pounds -- of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
Should the extra tax on this -- and on all carbon emissions -- appropriate for global warming be on the order of five cents a gallon , fifty cents a gallon , or a dollar fifty a gallon ?
Our views will change as we learn more , but at the moment whether the tax should be five or fifty cents a gallon hinges on a question of moral philosophy : how much do we believe that we owe our distant descendents ?
Australian economist John Quiggin has a very illuminating discussion on his website http://johnquiggin.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/sternreviewed06121.pdf.
The Stern Review on Global Climate Change ( on the internet at http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/sternreview_index.cfm) which comes down more on the side of fifty cents a gallon , immediately , does so because they project that spending today to reduce carbon emissions is a very good investment for the future .
If the world grows in per capita income at about 2 % per year , a marginal expenditure of roughly $ 70 today in cutting carbon emissions would be worth it if it were to enrich the world of 2100 by about an extra $ 500 of year - 2006 purchasing power , once all the damages to the world economy and environment from global warming , costs of adjustment , and so on are taken into account .
This looks like a very good deal to Nick Stern and his team .
On the other hand , critics point out that the world today is poor : average GDP per capita at purchasing power parity today is roughly $ 7000 .
We expect improvements in and the spread of technology to make the world of 2100 , at a 2 % per year growth rate much richer than the world of today : $ 50,000 per capita of year - 2006 purchasing power .
We today can use the marginal $ 70 per capita , critics say , much more than the richer people of 2100 will need the $ 500 or so they would gain from not having to suffer from the effects of global climate change .
What critics do n't often say is that the same logic applies to the world today .
The U.S. , Japan , and Western Europe today have average incomes of roughly $ 40,000 per capita .
The poorer half of the world 's population today have incomes of less than $ 6,000 per capita .
The same logic that says that we today need our $ 70 more than the people of 2100 need an extra $ 500 also tells us that we ought to tax the world 's rich in the OECD more and more to fund world development as long as each extra $ 500 in first - world taxes generates even as little as $ 70 in extra poor - periphery incomes .
If we in the world 's rich now are stingy toward the ( likely to be much richer ) future and want to leave them our environmental mess to deal with , we should be lavish toward our poorer brothers and sisters today .
If we today are stingy toward our poorer brothers and sisters now , we should be lavish toward our descendents .
At least , that is what we should do if we want to fulfill our part of Edmund Burke 's great worldwide social contract between the dead , the living , and the unborn .

Why a cache in an O/R mapper does n't make it fetch data faster .
Thursday , August 31 , 2006
Preface
One of the biggest myths in O/R mapper land is about ' caching ' .
It 's often believed that using a cache inside an O/R mapper makes queries much faster and thus makes the O/R mapper more efficient .
With that conclusion in hand , every O/R mapper which does n't use a cache is therefore less efficient than the ones who do , right ?
Well ... not exactly .
In this article I hope to explain that caching in O/R mappers is not there for making queries more efficient , but is there for uniquing .
But more on that later on .
I hope that at the end of the article , I have convinced the reader that the myth Caching == more efficiency is indeed a myth .
Beware , it 's perhaps a bit complicated here and there , I 'll try to explain it in as much layman 's terms as possible .
What 's a cache ?
Before I can explain what a cache is , it 's important to understand what an entity is , what an entity instance is etc .
Please consult this article first to learn about what 's meant with these terms .
A cache is an object store which manages objects so you do n't have to re-instantiate objects over and over again , you can just re-use the instance you need from the cache .
A cache of an O/R mapper caches entity objects .
Pretty simple actually .
When an entity is fetched from the persistent storage ( i.e. the database ) , the entity object ( i.e. the entity class instance which contains the entity instance ( == data ) ) which contains the data fetched , is stored in the cache , if it 's not there already .
What exactly does that mean : " if it 's not there already " ?
It means that the entity object is n't there yet .
Caches in O/R mappers are above all used for a concept which is called uniquing .
Uniquing is about having a single entity object for every entity ( == data ) loaded .
This means that if you load the entity of type Customer and with PK " CHOPS " from the Northwind database , it gets stored in an entity object , namely an instance of the Customer entity class .
What happens if you load the same entity with PK " CHOPS " again in another instance of the Customer entity class ?
You would end up with two instances of the same class , but with the same data .
So effectively the objects represent the same entity .
This does n't have to be a problem .
Most actions on entities do n't require a unique entity object .
After all , they 're all mirrors of the real entities in the database and with a multi-appdomain application ( like desktop applications accessing the same database or a multi- webserver using webapplication ) you have the chance of having multiple entity objects containing the same entity data anyway .
However sometimes it can be a problem or an inconvenience .
When that happens , it 's good that there 's a way to have unique objects per entity loaded .
Most O/R mappers use a cache for this : when an entity is loaded from the database , the cache is consulted if there 's already an entity object with the entity data of the same entity fetched .
If that 's the case , that instance is updated with the data read from the database , and that instance is returned as the object holding the data .
If there 's no object already containing the same entity , a new instance is created , the entity data fetched is stored in that instance , that instance is stored in the cache and the instance is returned .
This leads to unique objects per entity .
Not all O/R mappers use a cache for uniquing however , or do n't call it a ' cache ' .
You see , a central cache is really a very generalizing .
What if you need for a given semantical context a unique entity , and outside that context you do n't need a unique instance or a different , unique instance ?
Some O/R mappers , like LLBLGen Pro , use Context objects which provide uniquing for a semantical context , e.g. inside a wizard or an edit form .
All entity objects inside that context are stored in unique objects .
Caches and queries : more overhead than efficiency
So , when does this efficiency the myth talks about occur exactly ?
Well , almost never .
In fact , using a cache is often less efficient .
I said almost , as there are situations where a cache can help , though these are minor or require a lot of consessions .
However I 'll discuss them as well so you have a complete picture .
Let 's state I have a cache in my O/R mapper and I want to see , by using theory , how efficient it might be .
So I have my application running for a given period of time , which means that the cache contains a number of entity objects .
My application is a CRM application , so at a given time T the user wants to view all customers who have placed at least 5 orders in the last month .
This leads thus to a query for all customer entities which have at least 5 related order entities which are placed in the last month .
What to do ?
What would be logical and correct ?
Obviously : fetching the data from the persistent storage , as the entities live there , and only then we 'll get all known and valid customer entities matching the query .
We can consult our cache first , but we 'll never know if the entities in the cache are all the entities matching my query : what if there are many more in the database , matching the query ?
So we can't rely on the cache alone , we always have to consult with the persistent storage as well .
This thus causes a roundtrip and a query execution on the database .
As roundtrips and query executions are a big bottleneck of the complete entity fetch pipeline , the efficiency the myth talks about is nowhere in sight .
But it gets worse .
With a cache , there 's actually more overhead .
This is caused by the uniquing feature of a cache .
So every entity fetched from the database matching the query for the customers has to be checked with the cache : is there already an instance available ?
If so , update the field values and return that instance , if not , create a new instance ( but that 's to be done anyway ) and store it in the cache .
So effectively , it has more overhead , as it has to consult the cache for each entity fetched , as well as store all new entities into the cache .
Storing entities inside a cache is mostly done with hashvalues calculated from the PK values and stored per type .
As hashvalues can result in duplicates ( it 's just an int32 in most cases ) and compound PKs can complicate the calculation process , it 's not that straight forward to get the lookup process of entities very efficient .
Some tricks can help ... a bit and for a price
Before I get burned down to the ground , let me say that there are some tricks to speed things up a bit .
I have to say " a bit " because it comes at a high price : you 've to store a version field in every entity and the O/R mapper of choice must support that version field .
This thus means that you 've no freedom over how the entities look like or how your datamodel looks like .
This is a high price to pay , but perhaps it 's something you do n't care about .
The trick is that instead of returning the full resultset in the first query execution , only the PK values and the version values are returned for every entity matching the query .
By checking the cache , you use the version value to see if an entity has been changed in the db since it was fetched and stored in the cache .
If it 's not changed , I do n't have to fetch the full entity , as the data is already in the cache .
If it is changed or not in the cache at all , I 've to fetch the full entity .
So then I will fetch all entities matching the PKs I 've collected from my cache investigation .
The advantage of this is that it might be that the second query is very quick .
It however also can bomb : what if you 're using oracle and you have 3000 customers matching your query ?
You then can't use an WHERE customerid IN ( :a , : b , ... ) query as you 'll be exceeding the limit of parameters to send in a single query .
It also will cause a second query run , which might add actually more time than simply doing a single fetch : first the PK - Version fetch query has to be run , then the second full fetch query ( which might result in less rows , but still ... ) .
You might wonder : what if I control all access to the database ?
Then I know when an entity is saved , and thus can keep track of when which entities are changed as well and thus can make assumptions based on that info whether an entity is updated or not !
Well , that 's true , but that 's not scaling very well .
Unlike Java , .NET does n't have a proper cross-appdomain object awareness system .
This means that if you have even two systems targeting the same database ( webfarm , multiple desktops ) , you can't use this anymore .
And even if you 're in the situation where it could help ( single appdomain targeting single database ) , it 's still takes time to get things up to steam : until all entities of a given type are inside the cache , you still have to fetch from the database .
Cache and single entity fetches
There is one situation where a cache could help and be more efficient .
That is : if you know or assume the data you might find in a cache is ' up to date ' enough for you to be used .
That situation is with single entity fetches using a PK value .
Say the user of our previously mentioned CRM application wants to see the details of the customer with PK value " CHOPS " .
So all what should happen is an entity fetch by using the PK value " CHOPS " .
Consulting the cache , it appears that the entity with the PK value " CHOPS " is already loaded and available in the cache !
Are n't we lucky today !
Again , what to do ?
What 's logical in this situation ?
Pick the one from the cache , or consult the database and run the risk of fetching the exact same entity data as is already contained in the entity object in the cache ?
I 'd say : go to the database .
You only know for sure you 're working with the right data by consulting the persistent storage .
If you pick the one from the cache , you might run the risk that another user has updated the customer data and you 're working with outdated , actually wrong data which could lead to wrong conclusions while you could have made the right conclusions if you would have looked at the right data .
If you pick the one from the database , you might run the risk of burning a few cycles which turned out to be unnecessary .
A trick here could be that if the entity in the cache is fetched X seconds ago , it 's still considered ' fresh enough ' , as all data outside the database is stale the moment it 's read anyway .
But if correctness is in order , you can't be more sure than by reading from the database and bypass the cache .
So what 's left of this efficiency ?
Well , not much .
We 've seen that it actually adds more overhead than efficiency , so it 's even less efficient than not using a cache .
We 've seen that it could be solved in a way which could lead to more efficiency but only in a small group of situations and required consessions you 're likely not willing to make .
We 've also seen that a cache could be more efficient in single - entity fetches , but only if you 're willing to sacrifice correctness , or if you 're sure the data in your cache is valid enough .
Are caches then completely bogus ?
Why do O/R mappers often have a cache ?
They 're not bogus , they 're just used for a different feature than efficiency : uniquing .
Some O/R mappers even use the cache for tracking changes on entity objects ( and thus the entities inside these objects ) .
Claiming that the cache is making the O/R mapper more efficient is simply giving the wrong message : it could be a bit more efficient in a small group of situations , and is often giving more overhead than efficiency .
I hope with this article that people stop spreading this myth and realize why caches ( or contexts or whatever they 're called in the O/R mapper at hand ) in O/R mappers are used for uniquing , and not for object fetch efficiency .
I always thought you could only trade between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. , but the practice of buying and selling stocks after official trading hours is a relatively recent phenomenon .
According to Investing Online , after - hours trading was restricted to big - block trading between major institutional players and high - net - worth individuals .
The emergence of electronic communications networks , or ECNs , in the late 1990s opened after - hour trading to individual investors .
After - hours trading is essentially a limited and somewhat riskier version of trading during traditional business hours .
As The Investment FAQ explains , most of the after - hour networks operate as crossing markets -- buy and sell orders are processed only if they can be matched exactly .
Why is after - hours trading riskier to the private trader ?
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission points out that bulk trades result in more volatility , or price variations between bids and actual prices .
Also , the restricted nature of the trading may mean you do n't get the best price for your bid .
DIGG THIS
Opponents of an absolute state often wonder how far the American people will go in allowing Hitlerian totalitarianism into every single aspect of their lives .
When will they stop being compliant little beings , and instead , stand up and fight for their right to exist unencumbered by one totalitarian measure after another ?
The government intimidates the people daily via the reporting of so - called terror plots and flashing its danger alerts .
The media frenzy that follows gives us the caveat that we are all in immediate danger — from assorted hazardous weapons such as killer bras , sandal soles , eye compact , lipstick , and toothpaste .
Thus we must be willing to take immediate action to stave off all threats , we are told , or life and limb are in immediate peril .
No time to think about it , they say , because we must act now .
Accordingly , it follows that blind faith in our leaders is not only the patriotic way , but the only way .
This has lead to people selling their souls for what they perceive as comfort and security .
With life quickly becoming a series of snooping laws , assorted " security " measures , and redistributive schemes , people no longer take control of their own lives .
In fact , the masses have become so impregnated with the notion of the Supreme State ruling every aspect of their bloody lives , they are losing sight of what self - sufficiency and work ethic means .
This is why work ethic has been drilled out of their inner cores .
Who needs work ethic when you can have the Redistributive State give you a buck for twenty cents worth of effort ?
The other day , I got a response from a reader regarding my recent piece criticizing Thomas Sowell for his support of war and state .
All this reader could do to defend Total State was to recite lethargic , half - baked clichés that I see on SUV bumpers every day .
One thing he said was , “ Freedom comes to people because other people died for it .
Pure and simple .
Without their sacrifice , we would not know what the words freedom and liberty mean . ”
Of course , no cliché is final without a “ pure and simple ” at the end .
But what the heck does that mean ?
Needless to say , the underpinnings of liberty are not death and sacrifice .
Nobody ever cares to explain the meaning of these numskulled remarks that are meant to sound as sweet as a granny ’s lullaby , but in black - and - white they do n’t mean a thing .
Such clichés are nothing more than a jumble of words meant to convey total confusion through the perversion of clarity .
Freedom does n’t “ come to me ” because some guy in a foxhole thought he ’d roll up a little freedom in a paper airplane and fling it my way .
I know exactly what freedom and liberty mean , and it does n’t take aggressive wars and the spread of empire — in the name of passing on the good life , democracy — to define two words .
To interpret words takes a brain .
Critical thinking .
Effort .
Knowledge is the key that unlocks the lies and immunizes against indoctrination .
Knowledge takes time and work .
Clichés take 5 seconds to read off a bumper sticker or pull up off of Google .
The reader also grossly misused the Thomas Jefferson quote that refers to fertilizing the tree of liberty with the blood of patriots and tyrants .
He used it to defend the current war when Jefferson clearly meant to throw off a tyrannical government when it has oppressed the human spirit and stood in the way of the pursuit of Life , Liberty , and Happiness .
And surely , waging war and inciting domestic terror do exactly that .
The Hitlerian system is springing forth fast .
The recent rash of highly ridiculous and oppressive decrees in regards to airline travel puts our government in a total state of transparency .
Yet , the masses are wearing their blinders and do n’t see through it , or , their beer goggles are making Rosie O’Donnell look like Marilyn Monroe .
Hannah Arendt , in The Origins of Totalitarianism , remarks that in the early stages of a totalitarian movement , when political opposition exists , its proponents use propaganda and violence to frighten people into submission .
She adds :
Only the mob and the elite can be attracted by the momentum of totalitarianism itself ; the masses have to be won by propaganda .
Under conditions of constitutional government and freedom of opinion , totalitarian movements struggling for power can use terror to a limited extent only and share with other parties the necessity of winning adherents and of appearing plausible to a public which is not yet rigorously isolated from all other sources of information .
The same holds true when the opposition is not an opposing party , but crafty individuals that refuse to go along with the schemes and lies .
Therefore , the government must combat unregulated information sources , such as the Internet , with plausible claims of its own .
It thus pelts the populace with official propaganda , and tries to convince the populace that only it — the government — stands between freedom and security , good and evil , life and death .
Since 9 - 11 , airport oppression has been the key to reaping total power by fanning the flames of fear .
After all , we travel in order that we may move freely from place - to - place as we so choose .
Thus airline travel is important to meeting our needs for independence , and the masses can hardly ever be deterred from flying .
So the totalitarian mechanism called government has us all by the balls .
The government , then , concocts its zany stories of terrorist agendas , foiled plots , and phony intelligence reports .
The fact that there were / are / must have been WMDs in Iraq still lives on in the tiny brains of many .
Then , the government sets off these inane color alerts — the Homeland Security Advisory System — that are supposed to cause us all to react and immediately pander to its color - of - the - day .
You see , infantile color alerts are aimed at the person of average intelligence .
That ’s who the government needs to persuade if we look at this game by the numbers .
Colors are simple to decode — remember your wooden blocks in kindergarten ? — and easy to instill in the brains of masses of uninformed people .
The average citizen surely can and will process colors and interpret meanings exactly as their masters want them to do .
On top of all the other ridiculous schemes , the TSA is now regarding facial expressions as a form of behavior that can be deemed suspicious .
As Time magazine reports it ,
Select TSA employees will be trained to identify suspicious individuals who raise red flags by exhibiting unusual or anxious behavior , which can be as simple as changes in mannerisms , excessive sweating on a cool day , or changes in the pitch of a person ’s voice .
Racial or ethnic factors are not a criterion for singling out people , TSA officials say .
Those who are identified as suspicious will be examined more thoroughly ; for some , the agency will bring in local police to conduct face - to - face interviews and perhaps run the person ’s name against national criminal databases and determine whether any threat exists .
Is n’t this so crazy , preposterous , and perverse that the people have got to finally wake up and look through the Marilyn Monroe mirage ?
We have a totalitarian regime that can impede your existence by way of judging your frown or sweat .
The real issue is that if your facial expression shows defiance , rather than the submissiveness that is demanded by the tyrants herding you through their turnstile , you are a threat to " the agenda , " and you will be punished for not quietly submitting to your noble superiors like an obedient little chap .
And people get upset that we compare the Bush administration to Hitler ’s establishment ?
In Against Leviathan , Robert Higgs notes that " The government will never cease , however , to claim that it protects the people and to devote its immense resources to propagandizing and bamboozling the public to prop up that claim . "
So it continues to pile on .
People I observe react to the " terrorist news " and color alerts as if they were spectators to an extra-inning ballgame , following the play - by - play dutifully .
They tremble at each turn , and remark that the government " has to do something . "
They believe every single word of propaganda that they read and hear .
They see nothing wrong with the current state of oppression because they ’ve been hoodwinked into thinking all of it is necessary to protect us .
How pathetic is that ?
Lewis Lapham of Harper ’s magazine , while defining a fascist state , noted that within such a state individual citizens are " the property of the government , happy villagers glad to wave the flags and wage the wars , grateful for the good fortune that placed them in the care of a sublime leader . "
If we do not help to educate our friends , neighbors , co-workers , and family — via encouraging independent and critical thinking — we will see a fascist state that will far surpass the Hitlerian totalitarian system or Stalinist regime .
We may not be starved and locked behind a fence , but the masses will be stripped of all self - sufficiency , freedom of choice , mental stamina , skepticism , and the ability to discern between what is morally right or wrong .
Arming the people with knowledge , however , is our best defense against a creeping totalitarianism that will otherwise go unimpeded .
The depravity of an absolute state domestically and perpetual wars internationally must not go unexposed .
We must end the wars against mankind in order to win the battle for freedom .

Part of the train is left raised in the air at a sharp angle
Several carriages were left on their side after a Virgin London to Glasgow service crashed at Grayrigg , near Kendal , at 2015 GMT , at about 95 mph .
Police said 22 people went to hospital and dozens more were " walking wounded " .
Investigators say no cause has yet been established , but police said their inquiry was focusing on a set of points which could be " significant " .
Rail union chief Bob Crow had earlier said he had been told the accident was because of a points failure .
HAVE YOUR SAY
It 's very sad to see such an incident on what has become a very safe network
Ibrahim , Bolton
Send us your comments
One of the passengers , BBC executive Caroline Thomson , said the train " did a sort of bump " .
" It suddenly appeared to hit something and then lurched very , very badly from side to side in a very dramatic way . "
The train had about 120 people on board , Supt Jon Rush , of Cumbria Police , told a news conference .
He said 22 passengers had been taken to three hospitals .
The Royal Lancaster Infirmary and the Royal Preston Hospital took the most serious casualties .
A total of five people had serious injuries .
Police are still trying to establish the identity of the passenger who was killed , but they said she was an elderly female .
The line where the crash happened could be closed for five or six days , said Supt Rush .
He added that investigators were trying to establish the cause of the crash .
The leader of the Rail Maritime and Transport Union , Bob Crow , told ITV News : " All our indications are that people on the scene are saying that it was a points failure .
" And I think people can dismiss the idea that it was a cow on the track or vandalism . "
The train came to rest after rolling down an embankment
All but one of the train 's carriages had totally come off the tracks , a Cumbria Ambulance Service spokeswoman said .
Speaking at just after midnight she added that all nine train carriages had been cleared of passengers .
She said there were 65 people with minor injuries who were treated at the scene and a nearby farm , before being taken to the Castle Green Hotel in Kendal .
Emergency crews said they faced difficult conditions , with pouring rain , waterlogged ground and narrow country lanes around the crash site .
' Very strange sound '
The Pendolino tilting trains have been introduced by Virgin over the last three years and have a top speed of 125 mph .
Network Rail said the line speed for the area where the crash took place was about 95 mph .
Virgin Trains have suspended services between Lancaster and Lockerbie , with replacement buses operating .
Trains are running as normal to and from Lockerbie , and between London and Lancaster .
A spokesman said passengers travelling between Scotland and London could use GNER East Coast trains instead .
CONTACT NUMBERS Cumbria Police helpline : 0800 056 0146
Police family liaison centre : 0800 40 50 40 National Rail Enquiries : 08457 48 49 50
Those living close to the site described hearing the crash .
Adam Pashley , 19 , said : " It was one hell of a bang but I never thought it would be a serious incident .
" About 15 minutes later I was looking out of my bedroom window and suddenly I started to see police and ambulance crews . "
Donald Potter said : " My house is only about 120 yards from the track and I was sitting at my desk when I heard a very strange sound , it was completely unidentifiable , like nothing I have ever heard before , and lasted for about ten seconds . "
People worried about friends or relatives on the train are asked to ring a Cumbria Police helpline on 0800 056 0146 or a British Transport Police family liaison centre on 0800 40 50 40 .
Passengers wanting to travel through Cumbria , meanwhile , can ring National Rail Enquiries on 08457 48 49 50 before starting journeys .
Polyglot A program in eight languages
How to use Polyglot
It 's pretty simple : Download the source and rename it to polyglot .
[ cob | pas | f77 | c | ps | sh | com | pl ]
Compile and run with your favorite compiler and operating system .
Notes :
We have attempted to use only standard language features .
Without the - traditional flag , gcc will issue a warning .
When transfering from Linux / Unix to MS - DOS / Windows make sure that a LF is correctly translated into a CR / LF .
Keep the blank lines at the start of the program .
They are important .
10th Anniversary Edition Polyglot turned 10 years old in February 2001 .
Kev thought it needed an update , so he added perl , and fixed the x86 machine language to work with Win32 .
We felt pretty smug about getting another language in there , so we thought we 'd submit it to the The International Obfuscated C Code Contest .
Months later , when the results were finally announced , we failed to get a mention .
History A long time ago ( 1990 ) some people were talking about polyglot programs in rec.puzzles .
A couple of programs were posted that worked in two or three languages , and we thought that was pretty cool .
We thought we'd have a go , and wrote our own .
It was fun .
Some time later , we posted it back to the newsgroup .
And later still , we put up this web page ( http://ideology.com.au/polyglot) .
( The Nissl method , by the way , is still in use .
Nissl , a friend and close collaborator of Alzheimer , became a medical school legend with his instructions on how to time the staining process :
Take the brain out , he advised .
Put it on the desk .
Spit on the floor .
When the spit is dry , put the brain in alcohol . )
Image Credit ... Katherine Streeter
With Auguste Deter ’s brain tissue fixed , frozen , sliced , stained and pressed between two thin pieces of glass , Alzheimer put down his habitual cigar , removed his pince - nez , and peered into his state - of - the - art Zeiss microscope .
Then , at a magnification of several hundred times , he finally saw her disease .
It looked like measles , or chicken pox , of the brain .
The cortex was speckled with crusty brown clumps — we now call them plaques — too many to count .
They varied in size , shape and texture and seemed to be a hodgepodge of granules and short , crooked threads , as if they were sticky magnets for microscopic trash .
The plaques were nestled between the neurons , blocking their communication with one another .
They were so prominent that Alzheimer could see them without any stain at all , but they showed up best in a blend of magenta red , indigo carmine and picric acid .
A different stain revealed what Alzheimer called “ a tangled bundle of fibrils ” — weedy , menacing strands of rope bundled densely together .
These tangles grew inside the nerve cells , strangling them .
Auguste Deter had not lost herself .
Rather , her “ self ” was taken from her .
On Nov. 3 , 1906 , Alzheimer presented his findings at the 37th meeting of South - West German Psychiatrists with a paper titled , “ Regarding a Curious Disease of the Cortex . ”
What he did not realize was that these very same plaques and tangles were not just responsible for this rare , middle - aged dementia , but also for the majority of cases of senile dementia .
Nor could he have foreseen that with the significant rise in longevity over the 20th century , cases of Alzheimer ’s disease would skyrocket into the millions .
Paradoxically , we have created a civilization of such health and longevity that a disease that was once rare now threatens us all .

A friend of mine uses to say that Emacs fills our yearning for a Lisp Machine .
I tend to agree with him : Emacs is not just an editor , but a full integrated environment where you can perform virtually any imaginable task ; and , most importantly , the inner workings of the system are open to you to explore and extend .
Using , for extra fun , Lisp .
No , i do n’t think that Elisp is the nicest Lisp incarnation around , but is far better than , say , C , and i still prefer it to other scripting languages .
Moreover , the awesome range of libraries at your disposal makes up for many of the deficiencies in the language .
Living in Emacs is addictive .
Imagine an operating system where you can switch from writing code to browsing the web or chatting without leaving a consistent environment , with the same set of commands and shortcuts .
Imagine a set of integrated applications where data is seamlessly shared , where any single functionality can be tweaked , extended and adapted to your particular needs .
Where everything is easily scriptable .
Imagine , in additon , that the environment provides powerful and complete interactive self - documentation facilities with which the user can find out what is available .
I have yet to find an operating system providing such an integrated environment .
Not even Mac OS X , where AppleScript support is often lacking and system services are underused .
Of course , the key ingredient here is Emacs ’ extensibility .
Far from being an afterthought or simply one of its features , extensibility is the central aspect of Emacs ’ architecture .
Actually , the whole point of this post is to recommend you reading Richard Stallman ’s 1981 essay EMACS : The Extensible , Customizable Display Editor , which explains much better than I could the strong points of Emacs design , i.e. , those traits that make Emacs more , much more , than just an editor .
From the horse ’s mouth :
Extensibility means that the user can add new editing commands or change old ones to fit his editing needs , while he is editing .
EMACS is written in a modular fashion , composed of many separate and independent functions .
The user extends EMACS by adding or replacing functions , writing their definitions in the same language that was used to write the original EMACS system .
We will explain below why this is the only method of extension which is practical in use : others are theoretically equally good but discourage use , or discourage nontrivial use .
[…]
User customization helps in another , subtler way , by making the whole user community into a breeding and testing ground for new ideas .
Users think of small changes , try them , and give them to other users–if an idea becomes popular , it can be incorporated into the core system .
When we poll users on suggested changes , they can respond on the basis of actual experience rather than thought experiments .
The article goes on explaining the organization of the Emacs system , how it depends on its interpreter , Elisp ’s main features and how built - in self - documentation is provided .
Also interesting is the list of related systems at the end of the essay : Lisp machines , LOGO , MacLisp and Smalltalk .
We ’re definitely in good company !
Here ’s a letter that Umesh Vazirani ( my adviser at Berkeley ) sent to The Economist , and which he kindly permitted me to share .
I ’m guessing they ’ll print this one instead of mine , which is fine by me .
Sir , Your article “ Orion ’s belter ” regarding D - Wave ’s demonstration of a “ practical quantum computer ” , sets a new standard for sloppy science journalism .
Most egregious is your assertion that quantum computers can solve NP - complete problems in “ one shot ” by exploring exponentially many solutions at once .
This mistaken view was put to rest in the infancy of quantum computation over a decade ago when it was established that the axioms of quantum physics severely restrict the type of information accessible during a measurement .
For unstructured search problems like the NP - complete problems this means that there is no exponential speed up but rather at most a quadratic speed up .
Your assertions about D - Wave are equally specious .
A 16 qubit quantum computer has smaller processing power than a cell phone and hardly represents a practical breakthrough .
Any claims about D - Wave ’s accomplishments must therefore rest on their ability to increase the number of qubits by a couple of orders of magnitude while maintaining the fragile quantum states of the qubits .
Unfortunately D- Wave , by their own admission , have not tested whether the qubits in their current implementation are in a coherent quantum state .
So it is quite a stretch to assert that they have a working quantum computer let alone one that potentially scales .
An even bleaker picture emerges when one more closely examines their algorithmic approach .
Their claimed speedup over classical algorithms appears to be based on a misunderstanding of a paper my colleagues van Dam , Mosca and I wrote on “ The power of adiabatic quantum computing ” .
That speed up unfortunately does not hold in the setting at hand , and therefore D - Wave ’s “ quantum computer ” even if it turns out to be a true quantum computer , and even if it can be scaled to thousands of qubits , would likely not be more powerful than a cell phone .
Yours sincerely ,
Umesh Vazirani
Roger A. Strauch Professor of Computer Science
Director , Berkeley Quantum Computing Center
Update ( 2/18 ) : There ’s now a Nature news article about D - Wave ( hat tip to the Pontiff ) .
Like pretty much every other article , this one makes no attempt to address the fundamental howlers about the ability of quantum computers to solve NP - complete problems — but at least it quotes me saying that “ almost every popular article written on this has grotesquely over - hyped it . ”

I have various feelings about this paper .
I think if it were n't a veiled attack on the existing corpus of regex engine work it would be absolutely fantastic .
If you read it as an explanation of using NFA and DFA 's to implement kleene algerbras then its great .
If you read it as an argument for why you shouldnt use backtracking NFA engines or from the point of view of software engineering in my opinion it fails to impress .
A general purpose regex engine like that required for perl has to be able to do a lot , and has to balance considerations ranging from memory footprint of a compiled object , construction time , flexibility , rich feature - sets , the ability to accomodate huge character sets , and of course most importantly matching performance .
And it turns out that while DFA engines have a very good worst case match time , they dont actually have too many other redeeming features .
Construction can be extremely slow , the memory footprint vast , all kinds of trickery is involved to do unicode or capturing properly and they are n't suitable for patterns with backreferences .
It turns out that for a general purpose engine , most of the patterns that people want to match have characteristics that mean that the search space that requires a " real " regex engine can be efficiently pruned .
For instance , / most / patterns people want to match in real life have a fixed substring in them and the beginning and end of the match can be efficiently determined from the location of that substring in the string being matched .
This means that specialized string matching algorithms that are more efficient than DFA 's ( like Fast Boyer Moore ) can be utilized to find this substring and only when it is found is the real engine used to verify that the match is valid .
In many cases this can result in much faster match times than a DFA can provide , even when the verifier is an NFA with backtracking .
On a similar line a general purpose engine rarely needs to deal with " degenerate patterns " of the type illustrated in the article and many patterns that are degenerate in the current engine need not be .
Auto - possessivization is an open optimisation that would go a long way to reducing the number of patterns that would result in degenerate matching , which is itself blocked from being too bad by the superlinear cache .
In a similar vein an NFA can be made more efficient by judicious use of explicit atomic subpatterns and possessive quantifiers , both of which are a form of compiler hinting .
So , on the balance it turns out that an NFA can perform quite competitively with a DFA , while at the same time being much more flexible and powerful .
Sure there will be classes of patterns that NFA will not do well , but on the other hand there are patterns that a DFA cannot do at all which is less useful than doing them slowly .
At then end of the day I feel the balance of factors is on the backtracking NFA 's side .
I think there is a reason why there are n't too many industrial quality DFA engines out there , they simply arent suited for the job .
I think the truth is that for the messy real life problem of " pattern matching " no one approach on its own will suffice .
It seems to me that a hybrid approach is called for .
One that blends the benefits of the DFA with the benefits of the NFA .
In fact this is the direction that things have been going in the Perl engine .
An NFA framework with DFA - like components .
In Perl 5.10 we introduced a TRIE regop which allows for efficient matching of alternations starting with literal text and with a bit more work the framework used there could be extended to handle DFA type construction for degenerate patterns like the one in that article .
Anyway ,
In perl 5.10 youll be able to use whatever regex plug in you like , so perhaps we will see Russ Cox contribute an implementation to prove his case .

I 've been thinking of the " atomic subpatterns " and possessive quantifiers as pruning operations .
The entire search space may be exponential but entire branches can be eliminated if you just code your pruning operations into your expressions .
⠤⠤ ⠙⠊⠕⠞⠁⠇⠑⠧ ⠊
Exactly , they are hints to tell the matching engine not to bother backtracking .
Hypothetically the optimiser should be able to determine them all automatically and you shouldnt need them , but its a lot easier to let people do it themselves in terms of implementation .
Auto - possessiveification is something that sure does need doing .
If you consider the general case XqY , where X and Y are literals and q is a quantifer , you should be able to do Xq + Y whenever X cannot overlap Y .
Ive not got round to it yet tho .

Hmmm ... I read the paper and did n't see anything that resembled an attack .
To me it felt more like : " Hey gang , there was a fork in regex technology XX years ago and the fork we 're on now has some pathological cases .
This other fork does n't have those pathological cases , but has these other shortcomings .
Perhaps we can take the creamy caramel center of the NFA and wrap them in the chocolaty goodness of DFA and get something much tastier ? "
I totally agree with your reasoning of why we do n't need to go that route .
On the other hand , since reading the paper , my gears have been a - grinding with attempts at finding a way to merge backtracking into DFA without consuming insane amounts of storage .
It 's quite an entertaining mental exercise , even though I 've gotten nowhere yet .
( I do n't actually expect to get anywhere , but it 's still fun to try ... ) -- roboticus
Well lets see , the title , and the lack of any kind of analysis of how a backtracking NFA can mitigate its weaknesses .
For instance the pattern used for the performance analysis could be optimised to / a{n , 2n} / , and if written by a human probably would be .
And the optimised construct would not exhibit the poor performance that he graphed out .
In the discussion in the section marked " Real world regular expressions " he mentions that an NFA or DFA would do the opposite ( unrolling the expression ) but he doesnt discuss the impact of such a translation .
Unrolling such a construct would result in an unmanagably large construction .
A DFA that matches a {1,30000} is going to need at minum 30 k states and transitions in it .
Thats big .
Now the same thing would be represented in a backtracking NFA like perls in what four regops , lets be generous and say that each regop is going to be 10 words ( its more like 1 or 2 per regop ) , so we would need 40 words to represent that pattern in an backtracking - NFA .
A DFA or a Thompsons NFA would 30 k states , assuming each transition is only a word that is still a / huge / difference in memory footprint , and in construction time .
Memory for 30 k nodes would have to be allocated blah blah .
My bet is that before either a DFA or Thompsons NFA had finished construction the perl backtracking NFA would have already finished the match .
Another thing , the benchmarks showed only one side of things , the performance of an accepting match .
How fast will thompson construction be when the match fails ?
Perls regex engine will reject the match in less than N characters comparisons because it will use FBM matching to locate the an segment .
Its only when it matches that it behaves poorly , and that can be mitigated by using a better construct , which hypothetically can be optimised automatically at the engine level .
So its like the paper takes the tone " this is much better than that " and then glosses over all the hard stuff , doesnt mention the negative tradeoffs of the " better " solution , and gives no credit to the existing engines and the solutions they use , and makes no admission that there are optimisation techniques for working around the potential degenerate cases that might be encountered .
Update : tweaked some wording that wasnt clear ---
$ world=~s/war/peace/g
Some notes below your chosen depth have not been shown here
First off , algorithms can always be improved .
There is generally a compromise between pure processing speed and many other considerations , such as RAM usage and code maintainability .
Perl generally sacrifices RAM for speed , but generally considers speed and maintainability to be about equal ( knocks on the codebase aside ) .
Second , you must understand that Perl set the bar for regexes when P5 was released over 10 years ago .
There 's a reason why the primary C library for regexes is called " pcre " , or " Perl - compatible regex engine " .
In that time , a lot of theoretical work has been done .
Not all that work has been put into the current engine , for many reasons such as :
The change does n't provide enough for the risk of the making the change
The change breaks a feature that has to work
The change has n't been proven to do what it 's claimed to do
Remember - every script written for Perl waaaay back to 1.0.0 is still executable in 5.8.8 - backwards compatibility is a major concern for p5 p .
Also , the number of people who both have the understanding of the Perl engine and the necessary time to work on it are few and far - between .
And , honestly , many of them are hard at work fixing bugs , adding other features , and working on Perl6 .
And , lastly - fast is as fast does .
Perl is " fast enough " for me and my clients , and that includes the regex engine .
I 'm not a baremetal speed freak .
My criteria for good software : Does it work ?
Can someone else come in , make a change , and be reasonably certain no bugs were introduced ?
My criteria for good software :
Second , you must understand that Perl set the bar for regexes when P5 was released over 10 years ago . [… ]
In that time , a lot of theoretical work has been done .
You missed the part where the author writes he will be reviewing “ a regular expression search algorithm invented by Ken Thompson in the mid-1960s . ”
Makeshifts last the longest .
No , I did n't miss that .
New code is always being written to implement old algorithms .
Just because an algorithm exists does n't mean that there is an efficient implementation of it .
Theoretical work has advanced in the implementation of these algorithms and in how the various algorithms can be used to solve the problems Perl 's regexes need to solve .
My criteria for good software : Does it work ?
Can someone else come in , make a change , and be reasonably certain no bugs were introduced ?
My criteria for good software :
You 're missing the statistics there .
The P.C.R.E. approach takes twenty seconds for a ?30a30 , a reasonably simple regex , and continues to slow exponentially for longer patterns .
That 's not ‘ fast enough ’ by any standard .
I 'm sure that demerphq will comment further , but the article glosses over important implementation details like for example Unicode , lookaround and backreferences , all of which are left as an exercise for the astute reader .
This is all well for an academical paper but does n't have much bearing on the things Perl does unless it 's accompanied by working code .
The author choses to represent character classes as alternations , which is impractical with Unicode and even impractical memory - wise with a class like [ ^a ] which uses at least 32 bytes of memory in ASCIIspace and all of the Unicode space otherwise .
Zero - width assertions are unimplemented and the author claims them as " hard but possible in general " , and for backreferences the author even suggests to use two different engines because the machine cannot do backreferences .
I 'm sure somebody with any insight into how regular expression engines work nowadays ( and Perl 's especially ) can point out where the technique might be applicable , but I do n't see how the method can replace the Perl regex engine as a whole .
I ran a quick program to sort the regular expressions used in core perl into things that could be turned into DFAs and the ones that can't ( anything with back references ) .
There are 1075 transformable regexps and three non-transformable regexps .
Potentially we could benefit by using a DFA engine when the regexp does n't require back references .
This has the drawback that the behaviour is going to change .
There are usually many potential results from matching a regexp against a string but because of the expected order of execution we get the one we desire .
With a DFA , the results that are returned will come out in a different order .
This is something that potentially you 'd want to indicate is acceptable with a pragma .
If you 'd like to read more about this topic see Practical Parsing ( an excellent and readable text ) and also " The Dragon Book " .
⠤⠤ ⠙⠊⠕⠞⠁⠇⠑⠧ ⠊
You really want finer - grained control than a pragma can provide easily .
Perl 6 regexes currently distinguish || ( sequential semantics ) from | ( dfa semantics , at least up till " longest token " point ) .
This is meant to be reminiscent of the distinction between short - circuit and junctional logic in the rest of the language .
Here 's the program I wrote to characterize regular expressions .
I dumped the output of - Mre=debug after compiling everything in perl and ran this program on that output .
It turns out that it decides only three regexps * require * an NFA , 750 require at least a DFA , and 325 could be done with just a plain Boyer - Moore search .

I think you could rework this to only include [ A - Z ] in the opcode , if there is a number following the [ A - Z ] its not important .
In other words just look for OPEN not OPEN1 etc .
Also i think that youll need to add MINMOD to the list of non DFA 'able constructs , and maybe also should put OPEN in there as well since capturing with a DFA is distinctly non-trivial ( actually im not even sure you can do it with a pure - DFA , maybe with NFA based DFA simulation ) .
And why is NOTHING in both lists ?

I have to admit to getting lost trying to read that article .
However , ignorance is no reason to fail to comment ;-)
In all honesty , I pretty much stopped reading after the first pair of graphs and it appearing that they were picking some rather pathological cases .
They were picking on Perl 's well - known worst - case scenarios , and comparing them to another regex engine that had chosen differing optimisations .
I 'm sure that someone here could pick another pathological expression that would highlight perl 's vast superiority in optimisation on that string - which , most likely , would completely avoid the regular expression engine .
Neither one would be a fair comparison .
The idea really is to pick realistic data for your use ( which could be delimited text , log files , shell scripts , perl code , etc. , or , heaven forbid , actual regular text ) , and compare with that .
Where grep and awk really fall down is that to do anything remotely interesting as far as complex programming is concerned , you need to encapsulate them in a shell script .
At that point , you have the overhead of forking and execing hundreds or thousands of subprocesses ( including awk and / or grep ) , which probably vastly overshadows any possible perl slowdown on regular ( non-pathological ) data .
The author is clearly an idiot :)
The Perl porters have long known about pathological expressions that will continue to run after the heat - death of the universe .
This does n't mean those patterns should be banished , but with a little care , and a little thought , Perl probably offers the informed programmer techniques for supplying hints to the regular expression engine to avoid such exponential blowups .
I also find it interesting that Perl allowed me to write a very small amount of code in order to explore the problem .
And the solution here is to not use greedy matching .
Change ' aaa ' =~ /a?a?a?aaa/ to /a??a??a?? aaa/ and you have to push n out to about 100000 before you begin to notice any appreciable slowdown in the matching .
Take the following for a spin : use strict ; use Time : : HiRes ' time ' ; my $n = shift || 3 ; my $ opt = shift || '? ' ; my $ str = ' a ' x $ n ; my $re = ( " a$opt " x $ n ) .
$ str ; my $ begin = time ; print $ str =~ $re , ' ' , time - $ begin , "
" ; [ download ]
Try running perl rematcher 20 and then perl rematcher 20000 ?? .
I get a better than three orders of magnitude improvement .
Not bad for five minutes thought .
Seeing how the Thomson graph climbs slowly but steadily from the beginning , I would not be surprised if Perl continued to outperform it all the way out until things begin to swap .
update : after finishing the article , I retract the statement that the author is an idiot .
He does know his stuff , however , I still do n't agree with the conclusion .
He says that DFAs are better because you do n't run into grief with patterns like /(.* ) (.*) (.*) (.*)(.*) / since it does n't go exponential .
This is just silly .
If anything , it encourages sloppy programming .
Backreferences allow one to solve a much larger range of problems that DFAs cannot .
That 's why NFAs are in such widespread use .
And if it takes a little education and experience to wield NFAs with assurance , then so be it .
• another intruder with the mooring in the heart of the Perl
Of note is that Perl in particular already has safeguards in place to prevent exponential catastrophes .
At least for some large class of pathological patterns , it wo n’t match them very quickly , but neither will it explode in nearly the same way as more naïve engines .
The downside is that the required bookkeeping imposes a performance hit on all matching , which makes Perl ’s engine slower than that of languages with more naïve engines , like Java .
tilly wrote a great , long article on this subject some time ago .

Thank you a thousand thousand times , grinder !
Your note about using non-greedy regexes ( seems obvious in hindsight ) reduced some of my large text file parse script runtimes by roughly 70 % .
I was searching very generally for speeding up large regex operations and , as much as my eyes were starting to glaze over , you managed to clearly communicate a rather simple yet important concept without being obtuse or pedantic .
If only more searches resulted in such education . :) / salute
The speed of the perl regex engine is n't all that important unless it is too slow for a particular problem you are trying to solve .
If the problem is so time sensitive that the perl regex engine is your biggest bottleneck ( you did benchmark , right ? ) then it might be time to rethink your solution .
Perhaps moving away from regex , or perhaps using a language built for speed
Where perl shines really is the ease with which you can use regular expressions , and the useful ( if monstrous ) extensions such as ( ?{{}} ) .
Using regular expressions in php or c with pcre makes you really appreciate perl .
Older java versions were a bit annoying as well , but they have improved greatly in recent years .
Use whatever happens to be the right tool for the job .
It wo n't always be perl , but you can rejoice when it is .
I wrote the article .
Whether you think it applies to Perl depends on some usually - unstated beliefs about regular expressions and how they should be used .
Regular expressions started out as a notation for describing the strings that they match : a ( bb ) * a says " first an a , then some number of bb , then an a " .
They did n't say anything about how you had to take an input string and check whether it matched , and in fact there were multiple algorithms used for doing so .
As a computational measure , regular expressions describe sets of strings that can be matched in linear time with constant space , using an algorithm that is n't obvious from looking at the regular expression notation .
Perl 's regular expressions have come to be viewed as a notation for an algorithm that matches strings .
Operators like backreferences started the trend long before Perl , but new operators like recursion and , to a lesser extend , lookahead and lookbehind assertions , certainly continued the trend quite a ways beyond where it had been .
These features are most easily defined in terms of the underlying matching , not in terms of the strings they describe .
And of course , as everyone loves to say , Perl 's regular expressions are not regular expressions anymore .
( While this is true , a large fraction of the ones actually written are true regular expressions and could be treated as such . )
The big difference between these two is whether you think regular expressions should be treated as descriptive ( here 's the effect I want ) or prescriptive ( here 's how I want you to do it ) .
People who accept the existence of so - called pathological regular expressions implicitly treat regular expressions as prescriptive : " we gave you a lot of rope , so of course you can manage to hang yourself . "
I believe that until one crosses into the not - too - often - visited land of exotic Perl regular expression features like generalized assertions , recursion , and backreferences , it is best to treat regular expressions as descriptive .
Then the regular expression engine can implement the expression efficiently no matter what you 've typed .
Continuing the strained analogy from before , " you can have all the rope you need , but the regex engine is going to do the knot - tying for you once you tell it what you want to do , so there is no way you can hang yourself . "
In the prescriptive regex mindset , programmers have to microoptimize their regular expressions , knowing how they get implemented in order to avoid so - called pathological behavior by avoiding potentially - expensive operations except when he is sure ( and hopefully correct ! ) that " they wo n't be expensive in this particular case . "
In the descriptive regex mindset , there are no pathological regular expressions .
If there is some required substring , then fine , do that as a further optimization .
But the programmer can be guaranteed that running a regular expression will not be expensive , unless it uses advanced features like assertions , recursion , or backreferences .
Right now * and ?
are potentially - expensive features , and they need n't be .
If the Perl programmer is the one writing the regular expressions , then maybe there is n't much benefit to not having to learn how to " optimize " regular expressions .
After all , one has already had to learn Perl ; learning how to write regular expressions that Perl implements efficiently is not much more work .
However , if the Perl programmer is n't the one writing the regular expressions , then there is a lot of benefit to knowing that a regular expression search is n't going to run for years and years .
As an example , let 's consider a CGI script that is going to accept regular expressions as search keys .
The programmer needs to execute those searches , and it would be very useful if Perl could be relied upon to run them all efficiently , or at least to flag the ones that might not run efficiently because they have things like recursion .
Perhaps there could be a regex flag that says " run this in linear time , and if you can't , do n't run it at all " .
Then it would be plenty safe to take a regexp from the user and use it to run a search .
But with the current Perl regexes , no way .
Lest you think the CGI example is contrived , consider Jeffrey Friedl 's Japanese - English dictionary , which accepts regular expressions as search terms .
The regexp lookup is really slow already ( maybe the host machines are overloaded ) but I bet it would be very very slow if you gave it a regular expression like ( ( ( (.+ ) + ) + ) + ) +( aaa|bbb ) .
( Cutting off the search is n't quite correct here , since there are some entries that do match aaa , at least if you are searching for English . )
It 's great that Perl 5.10 is going to have a hot - swappable regular expression engine , because then maybe someone could build one that handles the true - regular - expression notation in guaranteed linear time and then Perl programmers could ask for it if they wanted a guarantee of predictable behavior .
Even better , that would pave a way to having Perl check for the non-regular operators , and if they were n't there , choose the linear - time implementation automatically .
In short , the article is not about making Perl 's regex matching 100x faster across all programs .
It is about making it more predictable and consistent across all programs .
And just to be clear , that is no more incompatible with whatever optimizations you might add ( like exact string search ) than backtracking is .
Thanks .
You 'll get some pushback from the curmudgeons , but by and large I think we 're a healthy enough community that we 're actually trying to learn from our mistakes , at least every now and then .
Certainly that applies to regex syntax ; I think it 's somewhat ironic that , just as the rest of the world is adopting Perl 5 regex syntax , Perl 6 is abandoning it . :-)
Anyway , I 'd be very interested in any suggestions you might have regarding the hybrid approach we 're taking in Synopsis 5 , especially the implicit longest - token semantics .
It certainly sounds like distinguishing | and || is a good idea .
I do not claim to fully understand everything in Synopsis 5 , but the general idea seems like being on the right track .
One interesting gotcha ( I can't tell whether it is handled correctly or not ) .
Consider the Perl 5 regular expression (.*) \1 run on ( ( " a " x $ n ) . " b " ) x 2 .
It should match .
However , figuring that out requires trying many possible matches for the (.*) part : the first try would be the whole string , then the whole string minus one char , etc. , until you got down to just half the string .
It is not clear to me that the longest - token semantics would get this right : it sounds like they would grab the whole string during (.*) , fail to match in the equivalent of \1 , and then give up .
All this is just to say that backreferences are even harder than they first appear , not that the longest - token idea is flawed .
Going by my experience with the trie optimisation the only difference between leftmost - longest and longest - token will be that you dont need to sort the possible accepting pathways through an alternation when cycling through them to find the one that allows the following pattern to succeed .
Assuming you use a stack to track all the possible accepting pathways then in the case of longest - token they will already be sorted so you just keep popping them off the stack until one matches .
The trie code however has to somehow process them in the order they occur in the alternation , which in the perl 5.9.5 implementation involves a linear probe through the list to find the best match each time .
( The assumption is that the list will most often be very small . ) ---

The big difference between these two is whether you think regular expressions should be treated as descriptive ( here 's the effect I want ) or prescriptive ( here 's how I want you to do it ) .
Well , both are at play in the perl engine .
If it was fully prescriptive then the engine wouldnt be able to to do things like using fixed string optimisations .
Then it would be plenty safe to take a regexp from the user and use it to run a search .
But with the current Perl regexes , no way .
Doesnt this criticism apply equally to Thompsons algorithm or to DFA construction ?
I would have thought the only difference would be that in a DFA youd see performance issues with compilation and not execution .
And just to be clear , that is no more incompatible with whatever optimizations you might add ( like exact string search ) than backtracking is .
Sure .
But the question is will Construction time +
FBM + Verification be faster for an BNFA ( backtracking NFA ) than for a DFA ?
And will the DFA consume radically more memory than the BNFA ?
And my position is that most likely the DFA will win only on degenerate patterns .
The rest of the time my feeling is that the BNFA will win hands down , mostly because of how cheap construction is .
It 's great that Perl 5.10 is going to have a hot - swappable regular expression engine , because then maybe someone could build one that handles the true - regular - expression notation in guaranteed linear time and then Perl programmers could ask for it if they wanted a guarantee of predictable behavior .
Yes , this is exactly why I was keen on making the regex engine pluggable .
We have seen one proof of concept for it , but its not well tested .
It would be nice to see someone do a plug in that uses a different algorithm .
Even better , that would pave a way to having Perl check for the non-regular operators , and if they were n't there , choose the linear - time implementation automatically .
I agree , it would be nice to automatically swap out to a better algorithm under some circumstances .
Assuming you did so only when the matching semantics were equivelent to that provided by leftmost - longest .
Thanks for writing the article .
Regardless of the debate of backtracking NFA versus more DFA like structures I think it was well written and quite informative .

I would have thought the only difference would be that in a DFA you 'd see performance issues with compilation and not execution .
It depends on the implementation .
If you use Thompson 's algorithm as implemented in nfa . c from the article , then you end up with a run -time that is O ( m *n ) for length -m regexp and length -n text .
It is true that if you pre-compile the DFA , then you end up with O ( 2 ^m * n ) time , but you can build the DFA on the fly and you 're back to O ( m *n ) , just with a smaller constant than the nfa .c version .
And just to be clear , that is no more incompatible with whatever optimizations you might add ( like exact string search ) than backtracking is .
Sure .

The rest of the time my feeling is that the BNFA will win hands down , mostly because of how cheap construction is .
This is a myth .
Like most myths it is based in a truth that is no longer true .
When people precomputed the entire DFA before starting the search , like the original egrep did , construction was in fact pretty expensive .
But no one does that anymore .
They build out the DFA on the fly , as described in the article .
If you build out the DFA on the fly , then the " compilation " or " construction " passes are more or less the same as for backtracking : basically you just have to syntax check the regexp and build some internal representation of a parse tree .
If you look at the big graph near the end of the article , you 'll see that the nfa .c in the article has cheaper construction cost than all of the fancier implementations , by about a factor of 4 .
And I was n't really trying .
Construction costs are what you engineer them to be -- neither approach has any advantage here .

In order to satisfy that " descriptive " you would have to build DFA if for no other reason then to make all |-s equal and to deduce non-greedy multipliers .
Just to remind you that once you cross the Rubicon to " descriptive " non-greedy intent has to be deduced .
So , at the very least , you would incur perf hit all the time for the sake of a fringe case .
Does n't really matter if you would hide it behind the dynamic building .
So if the DFA has the exponential explosion of states you would eventually reach the point of explosion .
Sorry I can't find the one that Ullman used to throw at unsuspecting souls :-) , but I 'm sure you 'll find enough of these on the net ...
You might get away with a stuff like " on the fly " DFA for something that is one - time run , but in such case the whole debate is artificial and academic .
For a real world run , when say I have a regex compiled all the way to the binary , say in .NET , and am paying the price of never being able to " unload " it for the lifetime of the binary , and the binary happens to be a server required to hit 99.9999 and is running that regexp on all incoming text ...
I think you get the picture :-) and what 's the purpose of non-greedy multipliers and all these assertions you dislike so much and why even a thought that someone might be building an DFA on the fly is not a realistic option .
Even if it could handle back - references , or more importantly a recursive parse with implicit stack - which it can't .
See , we actually need the interpretative , ahem interpretation :-) of the regex and the one that is stable across languages and platforms - thereby the PCRE and the only real " price " we " pay " is that we use non-greedy multipliers and we are done .
Most horrible thing , is n't it :-)
Now we could debate that we might prefer to have non-greedy as a default but that 's a historical note :-)
Also a matter of how precisely one wants to define the input he 'll take in .
Some people may insist on using negative classes instead , but they do n't write regexps to match a in a :-) .
As for the back - refs and recursive parse , that 's going to be more in demand , not less .
For example .NET implementation of Perl regex was designed to be able to parse XML without a perf hit and while I could n't say if Perl would take a perf hit for something like that , it definitely can parse XML with regex much easier then .NET .
So , you can go cursing everyone , starting with Thompson himself :-) or you can kind of come to terms with the fact that regex engines in widespread use are practical tools and not academic toys .
So , claiming that one engine is " slow " because it will have a problem with a ridiculous thing like a ?{ 3 }a{3 } on " aaa " but will run a {0,30} ?
a{30} without a hiccup looks like the ultimate exercise in futility .
If for some reason you really , honestly need to match something like that , well you can always write a regex , to transform " a?{n}a{n} " into " a{0,n}?a{n} " :-) )
Might need back - refs to handle more convoluted cases though :-) ) ) ) )
In the meantime I will happily cherish Perl / PCRE /.NET etc. regex in all it 's universal presence and benefits it brings - for all people with real needs for fast string parsing .
As for the back - refs and recursive parse , that 's going to be more in demand , not less .
For example .NET implementation of Perl regex was designed to be able to parse XML without a perf hit and while I could n't say if Perl would take a perf hit for something like that , it definitely can parse XML with regex much easier then .NET .
Im not sure what performance hit you mean .
Although ambrus had some neat ideas for something like the super - linear cache with regards to pattern level recursion that i have yet to follow up on .
Also juerd has published a validation regex for xml that is derived from the EBNF that w3 has posted .
The story that you cant parse XML or HTML with regexes is going to go up in a puff of smoke when Perl 5.10 comes out .

Howdy !
The title of the article raises warning flags : ' Regular Expression Matching Can Be Simple And Fast ( but is slow in Java , Perl , PHP , Python , Ruby , ... ) ' .
The title makes a far broader claim than the body of the article .
All the article shows is that Thomson NFA does n't choke on the specific pathologies that Perl does .
At a cursory glance , there is nothing to demonstrate the broader claim that regex matching is unconditionally " slow " in Perl , etc. yours ,

The stuff in that article is anything but not new .
For a comprehensive comparison of NFA 's and DFA 's check out Mastering Regular Expressions .
holli , / regexed monk /
You wo n't find anything useful about NFAs and DFAs in Friedl 's book .
What 's in Friedl 's book about that topic is misleading at best .
Friedl freely admits that he does n't care for the underlying theory .
That 's why I wrote the article .
Hi Russ , I think it 's a bit unfortunate how you phrased that response ( " nothing useful about NFAs and DFAs " ) , since it does n't make clear that you 're talking about the theoretical potential of the techniques ( which , indeed , my book does not cover ) .
As such , it sounds like an attack rather than the simple citing of a fact .
You had it right in your ( excellent ) article : Friedl 's book teaches programmers how best to use today 's regular expression implementations , but not how best to implement them .
I think a better response to Holli would be one noting that there 's more potential offered by the underlying theory than is evident in the common implementations covered in the book .
Whether the underlying theory is my cup of tea is not particularly relevant to my book , because the reality of today 's common implementations is that they are what they are .
Perhaps you would n't have so much angst about my book if it were titled Mastering ( what goes for ) Regular Expressions ? :-)
In your article , I 'm not sure what you mean when you say that I do n't " respect " theory (? ) , but it 's true that a lot of the theory behind what led to today 's implementations is beyond my desire to stay awake .
Here 's an example of the type of thing that trying to understand makes my eyes glaze : " An equivalence relation R over Σ* is right invariant if and only if whenever xRy , then xzRyz for all z ∈ Σ*.
An equivalence relation is of finite index if and only if there are only finitely many equivalence classes under R ( from Robert Constable 's paper " The Role of Finite Automata in the Development of Modern Coputing Theory " in The Kleene Symposium , North - Holland Publishing , 1980 ) .
You know what they say : " Those who can , do , and those who can't , teach " .
My book teaches how to use what 's there now .
It would please me to no end if I could throw out all the chapters on optimization and such , and perhaps your article is a first step toward that goal .
Some wo n't appreciate being told that the emperor has fewer clothes than has been thought , but do n't let that deter you .
I do think that along the way you 'll find some unexpected problems related to the semantics of capturing parentheses , for example , but heck , if you 're half as good an engineer as you are a writer , I 'll hold out hope , because the writing and presentation in your article is really top notch .

I hear that the engine has gotten relatively easy to replace in perl 5.10 .
It 'd be wrong to use a DFA with code that was written for perl 's default NFA but you could surely plug it in for code that knew it was going to use the DFA .
Have you given any thought to trying this out for real ?

What 's in Friedl 's book about that topic is misleading at best .
Friedl freely admits that he does n't care for the underlying theory .
I followed that same link when I first read your article and still have no idea what you are referring to .
Would you please quote the statement where he expresses his feelings about the underlying theory ?
I 'm looking for a job .
I scanned this article , and noted quickly that it is way beyond my scope of knowledge , or interest for that matter .
I am very attached to Perl for my own reasons , but not so much so that I do n't like to explore other ways of doing things , or attempting to understand how all that CS black magic works , and why there might be better ways to implement the underlying workings .
I always get that little mental twinge when something someone says or writes implies that my tool of choice is less than it should be ( even though that is not really what is being said ) .
This is relatively natural , and of course I go read about it and others peoples thought on the matter to see just how blindly religious I have become about my preferences .
From the perspective of a self - taught perl user , the answer to the question " ... felt that Perl regexp was slow ... needed to be improved " , the answer is no .
As I understand it , the " P " in perl is for " Practical " .
Practical for me means something that gets the job done .
Perl does extraction and reporting very nicely , and is therefor practical .
If Perl 's only job was to do regex 's , then it is probably not as fast as it should be .
But that is not Perls ' only job .
Back in the day when I worked for Cray Research , our job was to build the fastest super - computers in the world .
The machines we built were pretty darn good at what they did , modeling complex problems .
But they were not the fastest at everything , or even the best for all large scale problems .
They were ( and in some cases still are ) the most practical tools to use for certain kinds of problems , in certain environments .
Perl is like that for me .
Are other tools better at some of the things that Perl can do ?
Yes .
Is Perl the best at regex's ?
I do n't know , maybe not .
What I do know is that Perl is the practical tool to use for so many of the jobs that I do , that whatever 5 % , 10 % or even 30 % increase I could get out of using something else is just not worth the risk or the learning curve .
If someone wants to tweak the underpinnings of the tool to make it faster at something , fine .
Just do n't turn the world up - side - down doing it .
I am too damn old to make the adustment :-)
So , from my rather simple perspective , I will take the practical advantages of Perl , and not let myself worry too much about that little twinge I felt at the question about my favorite tool ..... :-)
Sometimes I have to just laugh at myself , and give everyone else the opportunity to join me !!
lol ... the majority is always wrong , and always the last to know about it ...
The perl regular expression engine could be seen as an example of " worse is better " ( I mean it as a compliment ;-)
It might not be the prettiest from some theoretical point of view , it might have pathological cases , but it exists and gets the job done .
Sure , it would be great if it had no pathological cases .
I have to say that I have never encountered one in real life , but I always feel a bit uneasy letting users of a website run regular expressions via a CGI script due to the risk that they will input a pathological expression just for fun ( you can set a timeout , but it 's a bit of a pain ) .
You could also use the expression " perfect is the enemy of good " .
Sure the perl engine is not that perfect ( in fact in many respects its a heap of steaming excrement that happens to work only because some guy named Zaphod and the Infinite Improbability drive happened to be passing by at the time it was compiled ) , but its good enough , has proved itself to be a powerful tool and has done more than all the other regex implementations put together to advance the programming communities knowledge and exposure to regular expressions .
Also given your link I find it amusing that rsc is from MIT . :-) ---
$ world=~s/war/peace/g
I think you 'll find it difficult to abort the regexp engine since perl 's safe - signals can be caught before and after the pattern match but not during .
If you were using POSIX : : sigaction , perhaps .
⠤⠤ ⠙⠊⠕⠞⠁⠇⠑⠧ ⠊
Why not make long - running instructions like pattern matches check for safe signals periodically ?
In reply to everyone saying that the pathological cases are only a theoretical problem , and are easily avoided , I ran into a pathological case in real life , and found Russ 's article via google for perl slow regex .
I have a bunch of PDFs and some metadata I want to verify .
Basically I want to check that the file actually contains the title listed in the metadata table , and stuff like that , to make sure the right files have the right names .
Punctuation often varies , so I did this : for loop over records from metadata table { slurp $ docid.txt ( from pdftotext ) into $ contents ; $s = $ title ; $s =~ s/\W+/.+?/g ; # gaps / punctuation between words -> wildcards if ( $ contents =~ / $s / sig ) { print " pos = " , pos $ contents , " , $s| " ; pos $ contents = 0 ; }else { print " $ textfile did n't contain $s
" ; } } [ download ]
So I 'm matching a regex that looks like Recogntion .+? of .+?
Credit .+?
History .+? for .+?
New .+?
Immigrants against maybe 100 kB of text .
That regex takes more than 1/2 hour to not match , on a 2.4GHz C2D ( AMD64 Ubuntu , perl v5.8.8 ) .
( matches are fast , though . )
I 'm just using /g here because I wanted to know where the title matched .
Matching against the whole file contents is overkill for the title , but I 'm planning to check for other metadata , which could appear at the end of the file .
My first attempt did n't use non-greedy wildcards , and took 30s for one easy match near the beginning of the string , and much longer for others .
Finding Russ 's article clued me in to why it was so slow in the common matching case .
I eventually gave up on perl 's regex engine for this task , and replaced the transformation to wildcards with an explicit search for each word in order .
my @s = split ( / \W+/ , $s ) ; foreach $ word ( @s ) { if ( $contents !~ /$ word / sig ) { print " $ textfile did n't contain $s
" ; $ nomatch = 1 ; last ; } } print " pos = " , pos $ contents , " , $s| " unless $ nomatch ; [ download ]
This runs on 345 text files totaling 52 MB in real 0m0.150s user 0m0.044s sys 0m0.068s [ download ]
The version using non-greedy wildcards is still running after 784 minutes ( started last night ) .

That 784 min perl process is running with LANG=C , too .
( I 'd rather use a locale where \W did n't match accented vowels , since some of the documents are in French .
They 're a digital library collection of documents , often EN and FR versions of the same thing from Canadian govt .
agencies .
Anyway en_CA.utf - 8 is not such a locale , so I might as well use LANG=C . )
The point of this post is to say this was a real - world problem for me , and it would have saved me several hours reading about this if perl used a non-backtracking matcher for patterns that did n't need backtracking .
I still have n't thought of a regex that 's fast ( in perl ) in the matching and non-matching cases .
If a m//g loop did n't work , I could have piped tr -d '
' | egrep , and it would have been fast enough .
I 'm glad to hear that future versions of perl might have a non-backtracking regex engine .
Happy hacking .
-- Peter Cordes , peter@cordes.ca
I just wanted to reiterate Peter 's view - these pathological cases do come up in practice .
My example is this regex , designed to find URLs in HTML documents ( pathological in .NET ) . href= ' " ( ^ ? ' " >*\?? ^' " >*)^>*(^>*)
As a user , I do not want to store in my brain the knowledge of which regexes are " safe " .
If this knowledge is easy to describe , why not code it , and at least for this class of regexes , use the Thompson algorithm ?
Of course , as an optimization that applies only for some use cases , this has to be prioritized , tested & integrated .
But in a perfect PERL , I would want to see it included .
Mr Sbano denies charges of rape and obtaining money by deception
Fadi Sbano , 38 , faces allegations of rape by deception over his relationship with the teacher from Pembrokeshire .
The " treatment " allegedly occurred for nine months before the woman told her doctor .
Mr Sbano , from Harrow , London denies nine charges of rape and 11 of obtaining money by deception .
Huw Rees , prosecuting , told a jury at Swansea Crown Court that the pair met in 2000 while Mr Sbano was based at Gatwick and the woman was working at a school in Surrey .
Then he started playing tricks on her , Mr Rees said , by telling her he had stomach cancer and had just six months to live .
When she developed an infection , Mr Sbano told the woman he knew a gynaecologist who recommended a cream be applied through intercourse , the jury heard .
" Proper treatment "
Mr Rees said the woman found the sessions " clinical , " not at all erotic .
She consented only because she believed it was a proper treatment .
" It began to dawn on her that he had devised this treatment in order to have sex with her on his terms , " he said .
Mr Sbano continued to deceive the woman and persuaded her the cream was expensive , the court heard , so she gave him £ 400 and her mother handed over £ 5,500 .
Mr Sbano also told both women he had to go to the United States for cancer treatment and the alleged victim 's mother gave him a further £ 1,500 , the jury heard .
After his arrest Mr Sbano denied telling anyone he had cancer and claimed the woman had invented the entire story about the " treatment " .
The trial continues .

The managing director of GMTV has apologised to viewers who may have paid to enter phone - in
competitions which they had no chance of winning .
Paul Corley said on this morning ’s show : " I ’d just like to apologise for everything that ’s gone on . "
BBC1 ’s Panorama claimed last night that some callers and texters stood no chance of winning as shortlists of potential winners were
finalised " long before " phone lines closed .
Scroll down for more ...
GMTV has said it found " irregularities " in the
system provided by Opera Interactive Technology and terminated its contract with the firm .
Mr Corley blamed " two or three people " at OIT for the problem and added : " If we had known , it would have stopped . "
He said GMTV would reimburse any viewers who had lost out , but Panorama ’s estimate that £ 40 million had been
fraudulently charged was " a serious exaggeration " .
OIT said it had improved its procedures and added that it not had not made money from any past errors .
GMTV workers fear there could be massive jobs cuts as the broadcaster attempts to pay back millions of viewers who have been fleeced out of as much as £ 40 million in the long running TV phone swindle spanning four years .
Workers at the troubled broadcaster said they were preparing to " bear the brunt " of the financial fall out of the scandal , after bosses said they would reimburse viewers who had been swindled out of up to £ 45,000 a day .
The revelations came as GMTV moved to distance itself from the phone operating company which has been blamed for the scam - Opera Interactive Technology - with the breakfast show announcing it had axed the company from running its competitions .
According to sources , the company is so incensed about the scandal , which surround its weekday phone competition , which offered prizes up to £ 20,000 , it is looking at launching legal action against the phone operator .
Desperately trying to salvage some respectability from the fiasco - bosses at Opera , which have been running GMTV phone - in quizzes between 2003 and 2007 , said they had suspended staff involved in the scam and were carrying out their own investigation .
The moves come after GMTV revealed it had suspended its TV phone in competitions , while it carried out a further investigations into the claims .
Presenters including Lorraine Kelly also issued a statement to confused viewers about what was going on .
Corley sent round a message to deflated staff telling them : " It 's not the end of the world . "
But the 250 staff who work at the broadcaster , whose main shareholder is ITV , fear that being dealt the blow of paying back the money and losing revenues while competitions are suspended , that the company will axe jobs .
A source at the broadcaster said : " It is hard to say how many jobs could go . "
She said : " Many here believe that staff will be cut to try and claw back the money - rather than the management falling on their swords over this .
Many feel it will be staff who bear the brunt . "
They also revealed that GMTV was forced to close down its messageboards because there were so many email from angry viewers over the rip - off .
Millions have been paying £ 1.80 each to enter a weekday multiple choice quiz which offers prizes of £ 10,000 and £ 20,000 .
GMTV has been soliciting for calls soon after the beginning of the programme at 6 am , but it is claimed was actually picking its shortlist up to 45 minutes before the supposed 9 pm deadline , meaning countless entrants were wasting their time and money .
The breakfast broadcaster announced it had terminated its contract with Opera last night , admitting its own inquiries had revealed
" irregularities " in the system the service provider was operating .
The broadcaster 's quizzes are suspended until further notice .
According to Panorama , which revealed the scam in last night 's show TV's Dirty Secrets , Opera sales director Mark Nuthall learned what was going on in 2003 and sent an email to staff telling them to keep it from GMTV .
The message , which was also copied to boss Gary Corbett , reportedly said : " Make sure they never find out you are picking the winners early . "
GMTV said it was " shocked and saddened " by the allegations , which it had first been made aware of when it was approached by Panorama around 10 days ago .
A statement said : " Opera said the allegations were unfounded .
However , our own inquiries then showed there were irregularities in the system they were operating .
" We apologise profusely to our viewers , who , understandably , feel let down . "
" Our contract with Opera makes it quite clear that competition finalists could only be chosen after lines were closed , giving every viewer an opportunity of winning .
" It is now clear this detailed process was not adhered to by some Opera employees .
GMTV also said it was urgently investigating ways in which it could reimburse viewers who believed they had lost money by entering competitions they could not win .
The company 's admission came after the show had earlier told viewers it had instructed City accountants Deloitte to carry out a full , independent review of GMTV and Opera 's system and was confident the competitions were being operated fully in accordance with the codes .
Premium rate phone line regulator said it was looking at the claims and had written to Panorama for more information .
Scroll down for more ...
Media regulator Ofcom has already launched its own investigation .
Panorama estimates up to £ 40 million could have
been lost , although GMTV said it thought the real figure - while substantial - was significantly lower .
Calls were charged at 60 p per minute but it is believed that the process of applying for the quizzes takes over two minutes , meaning callers were charged £ 1.80 .
The programme 's investigation covers the period up until the end of February .
Opera put out its own statement saying it has removed " relevant staff " had been removed from normal duties - pending further investigation .
But the company defended the claims : " Earlier this year Opera Interactive Technology took positive steps to improve its administration procedures and can confirm that all competition contestant entries throughout the entire competition period are now considered equally and fairly , whether handled directly by Opera Interactive Technology or by its telecommunications partners , using a randomised computer programme .
" This process , implemented as at March 1 2007 , has been observed and audited by Deloitte and has been successfully passed as satisfactory and in full compliance with the latest Icstis guidelines .
" Opera has in no way benefited financially from any errors in procedure in the past and will continue to keep its processes in line with any future Ofcom or Icstis guidelines . "
It had earlier told the documentary there was " not a shred of truth " in the allegations .
2006年5 月 結城浩の日 記
数日中断していた作業を継続しようと思ったけれど、
中断前にどこまで進んでいたか、まったく覚えていなかった。
覚えていることは、その作業に自分が与えたプロジェクトコード(数文字からなる英文字列)だけである。
でも、あわてないあわてない。 おもむろにプロジェクトコードをコマンドプロンプトで入力する。
実はプロジェクトコード名はバッチファイル名にもなっていて、
それを実行すると、そのプロジェクトの作業ディレクトリに移動するのだ。
すると、そこに自分の作業ログファイルが置かれている(このファイルはSubversionで管理されている ) 。
そこでその作業ログファイルを読む。数日前に私が作業中断前に書いたログが残っている。
数日前の私からのお手紙（引き継ぎ資料）である。
それをふむふむと読みながら「 Good Job !
よくぞきちんとログを残しておいてくれたね」と数日前の私に感謝する。
つまり、私が「記憶」しておくべきことはプロジェクトコードだけだ。
あとは作業ログファイルが雑多な情報をすべて代わりに記憶しておいてくれる。
こういう仕事の仕方をしていると、 自分の記憶力が衰えることはこわくなくなる（つまり、自己の能力に対する不安がなくなる）。
また、ちょっとした細切れ時間であってもそれなりに仕事を進めることができるから、
たくさんの仕事を並行して処理することもおっくうじゃなくなる
（ちょうど、将棋の多面指し(っていうんでしたっけ)をしているような感じ）。
さらに、一つの仕事をしているときに、他の仕事が気にならなくなる
（つまり、現在に集中できる）。
そこで大事なのは 「 作業ログの書き方」になるわけですが、
細かいテクニックはさておき、最重要ポイントを「たった一つだけ」押さえましょう（ってなぜに講義調）。 それは…
作業ログを書くための最重要ポイント：自分の頭の中に情報を残さない
「 自分の頭の中に情報を残さない」と心がけて作業ログを書くのが良いです。
ええ、もちろん自分の頭の情報をぜんぶ書くなんて不可能なことは承知です。
でも、たいていの場合は自分の頭に情報を残しすぎ。つまり作業ログに書き足りない点があるんです。 たとえば「次に何をやろうとぼんやり考えていたか」の「ぼんやり」の部分。 「 これはやっちゃだめだな」や「あのことは早めにすまそう」といった心づもり。 そういう「うまく表現できないけれど大切なこと」こそ、作業ログに落とすのです。
不完全でもよいです。 そのような心がけを「自分の頭の中に情報を残さない」と表現するのは適切だと結城は思います。
お試しあれ 。
追記：上で述べた 「 プロジェクトコード名に対応するバッチファイル」は自動生成しています。以下でそのスクリプト(hereという名前)を公開しています。ご参考に。
追記：s/多面差し/多面指し/の修正をしました。miwakoさんありがとうございます。

私の 「プログラミング言語の勉強日記」は以下にあります。
Scheme とHaskellに関しては 「はてなグループ」を利用しています。
先日、両方とも「オープン」という設定にしましたので、
「 Schemeの勉強日記を書いてみよう」とか「この機会にHaskellやってみるか」という方は、 よろしければご利用ください。 はてなユーザならすぐに書き始められます。
結城の承認を待つこともありません。
ちなみに、はてなダイアリーやはてなグループの日記を気軽に更新するには、
拙作「はてなダイアリーライター」が非常に便利です。
これがなかったら、結城は絶対に上のような複数日記をメンテナンスしようとは思わなかったでしょう。
なお、蛇足ですが、一言。 もともと結城は、 はてなグループを利用して自分の勉強日記を書くというだけのつもりでg:sicpやg:haskellを作りました。
でも、巡り合わせによって「私一人だけで使うのではなく、みんなで楽しく勉強する場」として公開する運びとなりました ( 楽しい巡り合わせです。babieさん、ありがとう！ ) 。 ですから、すでに存在するSchemeやHaskellのコミュニティというものを軽視する意図はまったくありません。
そういう誤解をする人は少ないとは思いますが、念のため書いておきます。
では、楽しんでプログラミング言語を勉強しましょう。
Enjoy !

今日は日曜日。 朝、雨のせいか、みんな寝坊。 あわてて用意をして教会にゴー 。
午後から奥さんは用事があって出かけ、 わたしと子供たちでお留守番。
Danさんのblogで紹介されて気になっていた 「 たけしのコマネチ大学数学科」をビデオでやっと見た。
ケプラー予想の回とヨセフスの問題の回。 なかなかおもしろかった。 ヨセフスの問題で、長男は、 二の累乗が関連していることまでは気づいたようだった。 もっとも「これって継子立て？」と言っていたから、知識としても知っていたのかもしれない。
ヨセフスの問題は『コンピュータの数学』にも例題として載っていましたね。
その後お昼寝（というか、午後寝）。 に入ったとたん、奥さんから電話で起こされる。
不機嫌な応対でごめんなさい。 眠かったんだよう。
そうそう、ソフトバンククリエイティブの編集さんから 『ふつうのHaskellプログラミング』（愛称「ふつける」）
をご献本いただいた。 ありがとうございます。 というわけで、夕方から青木さんの「ふつける」を読みながらHaskellのお勉強。 はてなのg:haskellで日記も立ち上げる。
babieさんの 「 haskell っ て一般的な名前のグループを一人で使うのはどうよ」という話題があり、
なるほど、それもそうかな、ということで「haskellグループの運営について考えました」というエントリを書く。
このあたりは深めるといろんな話題に発展しそうだけれど、
それをやっていると肝心の勉強が進まないので、まずは現実的な宣言をして、次に進む。

金曜日も淡々と仕事。 昨日の続きで、あまり構成・校正のことを考えずに、 メモをタイプタイプ。 そして心の中から出てきた何かも合わせてタイプタイプ。 前のめりにつっぱしるようにタイプタイプ。 タイプタイプ 。
… 1時間ほどタイプタイプしたら 、 一息入 れ てPDFに変換して眺めてみる。 ふむふむ。おもしろい。 自分の頭の中にあったもやっとしたものを、
あらためて文字として見るのはたのしいものですね。
さっと記録するには紙と鉛筆がいいけれど、 編集したり、並べ替えて眺めたりするにはコンピュータに入れるのが最適だ。
論理のねじれや、文章のゆがみはたくさんあるけれど、
とりあえず、今日の分、 自分が考えていたことは外にはき出され、記録された。

忘れないようにしようと気持ちを張っている必要はもうない。
頭をかちっと切り換えて（ぼうしをかぶり直して）、

今日も今日とて淡々と仕事。 どうせ後でばりばり書き直すことになるのだろうけれど、
まずはやってみるかと思い、 とある本の最初の章をいきなり書き始める。
書き進めると、 いつものように自分が知らないことがたくさんあるのに気づく。 きちんと文章として書くためには、 しっかりした土台と、 ゆらがない骨組みが必要になるのだが、 現在その準備がまったく出来ていないことに気がつく。
やれやれ、と思いつつも、 次に調べるべきことが具体的にはっきりするのはありがたい。
準備が整ってから書き始めるというよりも、 書いているうちに、 本当に準備すべきものが何であるか、 次第にわかってくる、というほうが現実に近い。
もしかしたら、きちんと準備ができた状態というのは、
本を書き終えた状態のことではないか。
ここはこうする。あそこはああする。 こっちはこれでよい。 何かを作り上げるというのは、 そのような細かな判断や意志決定の積み重ねの結果だろう。
ということは、すべてが決まった時点というのは完成した時点だ。
… などと当たり前のことを考えつつ、 心に浮かんだことをざくざく書いていく。

相変わらず淡々と仕事。 とある本のはじめの章の題材を練る。 すでにノートに手書きしていたメモを機械的にタイプする。 でも 「機械的に」というのは自分を仕事に向かわせるために使っている便法であって、
実際にやっていることはまったく機械的ではない。
ノートを読みながらタイプしていると、 心にはいろんなことが自然に浮かぶ。
浮かび上がってきた「輝く何か」を両手ですくい上げ、
傍らに置いてある水槽にそっと放す。 台無しにしないように気をつけてファイルに記録するのだ。
そんな風にノートのメモ書きをタイプしおえたら、
水槽は美しい何かでいっぱいになっている。
形はまだ定まっていないのだけれど、 この中から何か素敵なものが形作られてくることは確信している。
そんな水槽を抱えて、家に帰る。

月曜日は淡々と仕事。 とある本の最終章の題材を練る。 書きながら考えるって大切。 頭の中だけで考えたほうが速いことは速いのだけれど、道筋が残らない。 だから、現在考えていることを数日後に頭の中に再ロードするのは非常に困難。 記録を残しながら考えると、スピードは非常に遅くなるけれど、 数日後 に
「 続き」を考えることができる。 だからトータルとしての生産性は、記録を残しながら考えたほうがはるかに高くなる。

先日、所用があって実家に帰った。 姉も実家に来ており、いっしょに茶の間でお茶を飲んでおしゃべりをしていた。
そこに父親が書斎から出てきて、 姉に 「 この問題、解答が間違っていると思うんだが…」と話しかける。 見ると、三角関数の問題。 なんでも、父が塾で教えている高校生が持ってきた問題とのこと。
父が解き直してみると、解答と違う値になったらしい。
姉は、父の説明を聞きながら、ふんふん…と確かめ、
父の値のほうが正しいと結論を出す。父は嬉しそう。
しかし…高校生の数学の問題を解く父も大したものだけれど、 お茶を飲んでいるときにsin , cosが出てきてもまったく動じない姉もすごいと思う。

Knuth先生の 『 The Art of Computer Programming , Volume 4 , Fascicle 4 : Generating All Trees -- History of Combinatorial Generation』を調べていて不思議なことを発見。
1-201-85394-9 : 本に書かれているISBN
0321335708 : amazon.co.jp , amazon.comで表示されているISBN
なぜ違う ？
追記：
わかりました ！
私が見ている本が間違っていた……ようです。
「 0-201-85394-9だとFascicle 3になりますね」と教えてくれた読者さん、ありがとうございます。ああ恥ずかしい。
さらに追記 ：
「 本とサイト でISBNが違う件 」 は「結城の見間違い」でいちおう解決しました。
しかし、複数の読者さんから指摘があった、
「 1-201-85394-9ではチェックディジットが合わない件」はまだ解決していませんでした。
もう少しちゃんと書きます。 The Art of Computer Programming , Volume x , Fascicle yを VxFyと略記することにしますと、以下のように整理できます。
V4F2 : 本には ISBN 0-201-85393-0 とあり、amazon.co.jpでは 0201853930 ( 一致 )
V4F3 : 本には ISBN 1-201-85394-9 とあり、amazon.co.jpでは 0201853949 ( 最初の一桁が一致していない )
V4F4 : 本には ISBN 0-321-33570-8 とあり、amazon.co.jpでは 0321335708 ( 一致 )
( 誤り ) ISBNの最初の9桁をベクトルだと考え、 ( 10 , 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 ) というベクトルとの内積をmod 11した結果は ISBN の最後 の1 桁( 10 なら ばX ) になるらしいです。
( 修正 ) ISBNの最初の9桁をベクトルだと考え、 ( 10 , 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 ) というベクトルとの内積をmod 11した結果を、 11から引いてmod 11した値は、ISBNの最後の1桁( 10ならばX) になるらしいです。
ということからすると、V4F3の本に書いてあるISBNは誤っているようですね。
というわけで結論は以下です。
結城はV4F3の本とV4F4のサイトを見て「なぜ違う？」と騒いでいた。違って当然。違う本だから。
でもそれはそれとして、V4F3の本に書かれているISBNはたまたま誤っているようである。
またまた追 記
[ 備] ISBN の チェックデジットで 、 結城の計算式が誤っていたことを教えていただいたので、上の記事を修正しました。 感謝します。
use strict ; my @isbn = qw ( 4797331623 4797329734 4797327030 4844319159 4797322977 4797321261 479730507X 4797305819 4797307579 489052519X 4890528687 ) ; my @check = ( ' 0 '..' 9 ' , ' X ' ) ; for my $ isbn ( @isbn ) { my @digits = $ isbn =~ /\d|X$ /g ; my $ sum = 0 ; for my $ i ( 0..8 ) { $ sum += $ digits [ $ i ] * ( 10 - $ i ) ; } my $ check = $ check [ ( 11 - ( $ sum % 11 ) ) % 11 ] ; if ( $ digits [ 9 ] eq $ check ) { print " $isbn OK

チェックするだけならこれでもよいか。
ISBN 全体をベクトルだと考え、 ( 10 , 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 ) というベクトルとの内積をmod 11した結果は0になる ( ISBN の最後の1桁がXならばその桁は10と見なす ) 。

月曜日は淡々と仕事。 新しい本（ええと、次の本か、次の次の本か、その次の本かは不明ですが）の目次をもう一度練る。 普段から書きためていたノートを見て、タイプし直す。 タイプしながら少しずつ内容をふくらませてみる。 はじめは思い切り、何でもかんでも入れてみる。 そうしているうちにだんだん方向性が見えてくる（はず）なので、今度は絞り込む。 最近 は 「 何を入れるか」よりも「何を削るか」が大事ということがわかってきたので、ていねいに読み返してばっさりと。
でも、自分の気持ちを納得させるためにバージョン管理はしておく。
「いまばっさり削っても、バージョン管理しているからいざとなれば昔に戻せるんだよ」と自分に言い聞かせて、削る。
でもいままで、いったん削ったのをバージョン管理で戻したことはないんですけれどね :- P 自分の意志ではどうにもならない抵抗感をなくすために、バージョン管理しておくという儀式が必要なのでした。

豊かな人生のための四つの法則
By Mark Gregory
International business reporter , BBC World Service
Bechtel has been in Iraq since 2003
Decades of conflict and sanctions had wrecked the infrastructure of roads , power stations , schools and hospitals .
When US President George W Bush announced the war had ended , he promised the US would help to rebuild Iraq , saying : " Now that the dictator 's gone we and our coalition partners are helping Iraqis to lay the foundations of a free economy . "
The CPA handed over $ 8.8 bn in cash to the Iraqi government even though that new government had no security or accounting system .
No one can account for it
Henry Waxman
Democratic congressman
These Iraqi funds were controlled by the Americans during the year - long occupation that followed the war .
They consisted mainly of Iraqi oil revenues and leftover cash from the oil - for - food programme - the pre-war sanctions regime run by the United Nations .
The money was in the Development Fund for Iraq , set up by the UN as the war ended .
' A huge scandal '
In hearings on Capitol Hill in Washington , Democratic congressman Henry Waxman has emerged as the most vocal critic of the US ' record on reconstruction .
In particular , Mr Waxman says proper accounting procedures were ignored when large sums of Iraqi cash were handed over by the Coalition Provisional Authority ( CPA ) - the US - led body that ran Iraq immediately after the war - to get Iraqi ministries functioning again .
" I think we 're looking at a huge scandal .
The CPA handed over $ 8.8 bn in cash to the Iraqi government even though that new government had no security or accounting system .
" No one can account for it .
We do n't know who got that money , " Mr Waxman said .
Stuart Bowen is the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction .
His task is to follow the paper trail - and after more than 100 investigations his work paints a grim picture of waste and mismanagement .
Mr Bowen said billions of dollars were shrink - wrapped in plastic and flown out of the US to Baghdad .
" It was $ 2bn a flight , and I know of at least six flights , " he said .
Mr Bowen said some of the cash went to pay the salaries of thousands of " ghost employees " , or Iraqi civil servants who did not actually exist .
' Spending to save lives '
As the planes landed with their hefty bundles of greenbacks , they became the responsibility of a man named David Oliver .
Mr Oliver was in Baghdad in the summer of 2003 as the CPA 's first head of finance .
He helped establish the financial framework , but resisted pressure to bring in outside auditors .
Billions of dollars of their [ Iraqi ] money disappeared , yes I understand , I 'm saying what difference does it make ?
I chose to give that money to the Iraqis , they got the power working within eight days in the major hospitals in Baghdad
David Oliver
CPA head of finance
" I have no idea , I can't tell you whether or not the money went to the right things or did n't - nor do I actually think it is important , " he said .
Yes , but the fact is that billions of dollars have disappeared without trace .
" Of their money .
Billions of dollars of their money disappeared , yes I understand , I 'm saying what difference does it make ? "
That may seem an astonishingly complacent statement .
But it made no difference to Mr Oliver because he felt there were more pressing priorities .
" There were 1,600 British - trained auditors in Iraq , so why lay another infrastructure that was American and designed for a completely different culture and different set of circumstances ? "
He said premature babies in intensive care units were dying during power outages because hospitals had no back - up power supplies .
" I chose to give that money to the Iraqis , they got the power working within eight days in the major hospitals in Baghdad , " he said .
By following US procurement and audit procedures it would have taken 30 or 40 days before the problem was even looked at , he said .
In his view it was more important to save lives to get things done than worry about accounting procedures .
' On America 's watch '
Andy Bearpark was in charge of infrastructure and development at the CPA .
It was his job to supervise reconstruction , but he says never in his career had he come across such a lack of preparation .
" The plan had to be created at the same time as it was being implemented .
Everything to do with the CPA was being invented from scratch , from a zero base , " he said .
In this atmosphere of improvisation and chaos , it is perhaps not surprising that accounting procedures took a back seat .
Not long after arriving in Baghdad , Mr Bearpark recalls being handed a huge dossier on the long - term rebuilding of Iraq .
It had been drawn up by the US construction company , Bechtel .
" The figures they came up with was about $ 20 bn .
But these things were being done amazingly quickly .
The time pressure was something I 'd never , ever experienced before , " he said .
" I remember being given that Bechtel assessment ... and having something like three hours to say : ' Is this a good idea or a bad idea ? ' "
But while most of the corruption allegations centre on the Iraqi money , the financial chaos also extended to projects financed by US taxpayers .
One early contract - to Halliburton - aroused great controversy because it appeared to bypass normal rules .
It was awarded without any process of bidding for it .
So what have we got ?
Allegations of impropriety in the awarding of contracts in the US , chaos at the occupation authority that ran post - war Iraq and large sums of Iraqi oil money disappearing apparently without any record of how it was spent .
And all this on America 's watch .
Mark Gregory 's documentary series The Baghdad Billions - an investigation into how money allocated to reconstruction in Iraq has been spent - can be heard on the World Service at 0900 GMT on 9 and 10 November .

BBC News , Addis Ababa
Kamilat Mehdi , 21 , had a bright future ahead of her .
She dreamt about doing a degree and becoming an air hostess .
Kamilat Mehdi knew her attacker
All that changed one night when she was walking home from work with her two sisters and a stalker threw sulphuric acid in her face .
She is now lying in hospital disfigured beyond recognition .
Her skin is red raw , her eyelids have almost been entirely destroyed and her hairline has been burnt back .
" I feel very sick now .
Every day they need to do something without anaesthetic so it is hard to accept and it is very painful , " says Kamilat .
Her sisters , Zeyneba and Zubyeda , escaped with lesser injuries but their faces were also burnt by the acid .
Shockwaves
" We were on our way home from our parents ' shop .
I was with my sisters , " Kamilat says .
He gave her a hard time but she did n't tell the family for fear that something would happen to them
Kamilat 's brother Ismael
" One guy came and he looked like a drunkard but he was n't drunk .
He forced us to go down a dark alley and then someone came and threw acid in our faces . "
Kamilat fell to the floor unconscious while her sisters tried to get help .
She lay there until her brother Ismael arrived .
Ismael says his sister knew her attacker .
" He bothered her for a long time - at least four years , " he says .
" He gave her a hard time but she did n't tell the family for fear that something would happen to them .
He was always saying he would use a gun on them . "
This incident has sent shockwaves through the community in the capital , Addis Ababa , and amongst Ethiopians abroad .
Ismael says he has received calls from Ethiopians living around the world saying how angry and shocked they were about the attack .
Two men have appeared in court in Addis Ababa in connection with the attack .
Sexual harassment
" I hope the court will impose a proportional penalty within a short period of time , " Justice Minister Assefa Kiseto says .
" That could make others learn from this and refrain from committing this crime .
I think this kind of crime is a crime against the whole nation not just a crime against Kamilat . "
Attacks like this are rare in Ethiopia but women 's groups in Addis Ababa say that stalking and sexual harassment are common problems .
The Ending Violence Against Women report published by the United Nations at the end of last year said almost 60 % of Ethiopian women were subjected to sexual violence at some point in their lives .
Mahdere Paulos from the Ethiopian Women Lawyers Association says they would like to see a specific provision in Ethiopian law that tackles stalking and harassment so that there is better protection for young girls like Kamilat in the future .
" The problem starts with stalking - the end result is something else , " she says .
" It might end in grave bodily injury , it might end in death and it might end in different difficult situations and that 's why we want it to be taken seriously . "
Following the uproar at Kamilat 's attack , the Supreme Court announced that it has put in place procedures to help pass verdicts on such cases within two days .
And Ms Mahdere says some progress has been made by the government over the last few years in tackling violence against women .
There is a newly established ministry of women 's affairs ; there was a push before the 2005 election to get more women into parliament and there has been a complete overhaul of the penal code to beef up laws to protect women .
But in some rural areas , the traditional practice of abducting young girls and forcibly marrying them remains common - in one region it accounts for some 92 % of all marriages , according to the most recent figures from 2003 .
Kamilat and her sister have now flown to Paris for medical treatment , which is being financed by businessman Sheikh Mohammed Al Amoudi .
It 's good to wait at least two weeks after a story is completely forgotten to try and capitalize on the popularity of that original story .
Sarcasm is also good .
Se what I did there ?
By David Fenton
BBC South Health Correspondent
David Fenton interviewed Trevor during the operation
It was the strangest interview I have ever done .
Half sitting , half lying in front of me was a man talking about his holidays .
He wanted to go to Italy .
The strange part was that as he spoke , surgeons were cutting out a tumour from deep inside his brain .
The patient , Trevor Burlton , was completely conscious and aware of what was going on around him throughout the four - hour operation .
He chatted , he joked , he looked around - he looked bored .
For me , dressed in full surgical scrubs and watching him from behind a camera , it was a very strange experience .
Really awake
But probably not as strange as hearing a drill going in the back of your head and not being bothered by it .
I was spending a week at the Wessex Neurological Centre at Southampton General Hospital , for a series broadcast this week on BBC South Today .
Trevor was undergoing a craniotomy while awake .
I was keen to see how it went .
Trevor Burlton said he felt fine but " a little strange " during the surgery
" No problem , " said the surgeon Paul Grundy .
" But will he really be awake ?
I mean will he be able to talk to me , or just grunt ? "
I ask , knowing how these things have a knack of turning out to be not what you expected .
He just smiled and said : " See for yourself . "
The first thing to happen was that Trevor 's brain was scanned and " mapped " so that the precise location of the tumour could be determined .
He was then put into place on the operating table and his head was secured in a clamp - which looked a bit alarming but was vitally important .
Opened skull
If Trevor moved - even just a few millimetres - the computer mapping would not work .
I feel I could just get up and walk away . "
Trevor Burlton
Then it was down to business .
The surgeon opened up the back of Trevor 's skull and began searching for the tumour .
With the medics behind him , and me in front of him , Trevor had quite a lot to contend with but he coped admirably .
" What does it feel like ? " I asked , when they got down to the tumour - which was somewhere about level with his eyes .
" It feels fine , " he said .
" Just slightly hot now and then but nothing serious .
" I was told I was going to be relaxed , and I am relaxed .
I feel quite all right .
It 's strange , very strange .
I feel I could just get up and walk away . "
Although Trevor was conscious , he was receiving small doses of anaesthetic to help keep him calm and relaxed ; a tricky and very specialised job .
24 hours after the operation Trevor was sitting up reading
" Really there is not any discomfort for the patients , " said Paul Grundy .
" There are n't any pain receptors inside the head , so nothing inside the head hurts . "
But why bother with all this ?
Why not just put the patient under and be done with it ?
Well - it 's better for the patient , and in Trevor 's case the tumour was close to a part of the brain which controlled his left leg and arm .
Any mistake with the scalpel and he could have been paralysed down one side .
As Paul Grundy and his team operated they continually checked that the parts they were cutting out were not needed - by asking Trevor what he felt and testing his reflexes .
This could be done only with a conscious patient .
Twenty - four hours after the operation Trevor was sitting up in bed reading .
It was a success .
He has now returned home to Bournemouth where he is busy planning his holiday to Italy .
« 37 Signals Passion Review | Main | An iPod Sheep Fights Back »
Physics of Passion : The Koolaid Point
You do n't really have passionate users until someone starts accusing them of " drinking the koolaid . "
You might have happy users , even loyal users , but it 's the truly passionate that piss off others enough to motivate them to say something .
Where there is passion , there is always anti-passion ... or rather passion in the hate dimension .
If you create passionate users , you have to expect passionate detractors .
You should welcome their appearance in blogs , forums , and user groups .
It means you 've arrived .
Forget the tipping point -- if you want to measure passion , look for the koolaid point .
And it would appear that 37 Signals has hit it .
Within 48 hours of one another , independently , three groups reviewed the company : this blog , Salon , and Paul Scrivens ' blog .
Two of the reviews glowed .
The other ... provided balance in the universe .
Remember folks , we are n't going for user satisfaction .
We are n't going for happy .
We 're going for all - out passion .
And that comes with a price tag .
Detractors .
Lots of them .
And they talk .
For every passionate user out evangelizing you to everyone they meet , a koolaid - hunter will do his ( or her ) best to make sure everyone knows that your passionate users have lost their minds .
That they 're victim of marketing hype .
Sheep .
But consider this ...
The most popular and well - loved companies , products , and causes have the strongest opponents .
You 'll know when you get there , because the buzz goes from pleasant to polarized .
Moderate , reasoned reviews and comments are replaced with stronger language and more colorful adjectives on both sides .
Those who speak out against you will be referred to as " brave " or " having the balls " ( see the comments on Scriven 's review ) for daring to criticize .
They 're hailed as the smart ones who finally call the emporer on his buck - nakedness .
Should you ignore the detractors ?
Diss them as nothing but evidence of your success ?
Should you just wave them off with a " just jealous " remark ?
Absolutely not .
Somewhere in their complaints there are probably some good clues for things you can work on .
But if you start trying to please them all or even worse , turn them into fans , that could mean death .
Death by mediocrity , as you cater to everybody and inspire nobody .
It is physically impossible to have everyone love what you do .
And the more people do love it , the more likely it is that you 'll have an equal and opposite negative reaction .
X = -Y the physics of passion .
Would you want to be in 37 Signals ' shoes right now , taking all this heat ?
You bet .
Look who 's been there before :
* Apple ( see the wonderful Cult of Mac blog )
* Extreme Programming ( see Matt Stephen 's Software Reality blog )
* The Sierra Club
* The Red Sox ( see the Yankees Suck site )
* NASCAR ( read instanpundit's notes )
* The Hummer ( read the official F*** You and your H2 site )
* Britney Spears ( see the I Hate Britney Spears site )
* Java ( see the delightful No - one - cares - about - my - language - and - therefore - I - hate - Java note , or my special Java fan site , javaranch )
And on it goes .
Oh yeah , besides the " koolaid " word -- another word the detractors will use to marginalize something : " fad " .
As in , " Oh , that 's just a fad .
It 'll be over soon . "
I remember hearing that in 1998 about Java , now the leading programming language .
The iPod is a fad .
Our Head First Java book was just a fad ( yesterday on Amazon , out of all 32,000 computer books , there were two Head First books in the top ten ) .
Hip hop music was just a fad .
Skateboarding .
Snowboarding .
The web .
So we 'll see .
But remember during those dark days when you 're fending off the detractors ( especially when they have legitmate complaints ) , that -- as Seth Godin tells us -- " Safe is risky and risky is safe . "
You 'll never be perfect .
Apple is n't perfect .
Java is n't perfect .
Our books are far from perfect .
37 Signals is n't perfect .
But you can be brave .

Do n't forget the word " cult " .
We 're trained to be afraid of cults in the most traditional sense and yet we wholeheartedly embrace cult films , cult music , cult festivals , etc etc .
Posted by : Jack | Aug 11 , 2005 12:22:56 AM
It 's true : watching " 2001 : A Space Odyssey " the other night , it occurred to me that the film is actually quite dull , with very little dialogue .
It 's a great film because of what it represented , but anyone who harps on about how it 's their fave film and they 've seen it a gazillion times is just going along with the hearsay .
A Clockwork Orange , banned for 25 years in the UK by the director , was hugely popular because of all the negative hype .
Bad press generates interest .
Posted by : Adam Hopkinson | Aug 11 , 2005 3:49:21 AM
I do n't think cult has such a bad connotation anymore , now many people are anti-popular .
They like being outside the crowd while at the same time being part of a group .
Being in a cult , especially one based on technology or fashion or whatever ; not religion seems very appealing .
Cult , sounds more like a club really , a club of enthusiasts .

Based on the statements in the post , it would seem that Microsoft also belongs to the group of companies who " gets it " .
God knows that their products are n't perfect and that they are derided by a whole bunch of folks .
Would that be a correct assessment of the ideas delivered in this post ?

Posted by : Sandy Boy | Aug 11 , 2005 2:45:59 PM
Sandy Boy , you bring up a fun spin on this ... but the way I see it is that without the Koolaid factor , it does n't count .
It 's not about how many ( or even how voraciously ) people dislike you ... it 's about balancing the equation .
You might have a ton of people who dislike you simply because ... you actually suck .
Unless that passionate * hatred * is balanced out by passionate * love* , the equation does n't balance and thus you probably do n't have passionate users ( or at least not enough of them to cross the Koolaid threshold ) .
The Koolaid Point means that the nature of the passionate dislike for your product or company is specifically fueled by the opposite passion -- passion on the " love " side .
I do n't hear too many people accusing users of " drinking the Microsoft Koolaid " or " falling for the slick Microsoft marketing hype and sexy products . "
If someone criticizes * you* , that in itself is of course NO indication that you have passionate users .
It 's when the detractors start criticizing * your users * that you know you 're on to something , especially when that criticism revolves around users who are so passionate that they annoy -- and sometimes frighten - - others .
Although it is true that people criticize MS users , they do n't refer to them as cult followers .
It 's all about the Koolaid .
Shaded : will you agree to wear the little uniform ?

No other sector apart from computer programming , that I know of , disses each other with the koolaid factor .
This is mainly because everyone else is bothered about " increasing shareholder value " and not stroking / destroying the ego of the programmer or who ever created the tool / api / website in the first place .
Perhaps we should go back to the gut feeling test , get programmers who give a thirty second elevator pitch about their proposed tool and see if that tickles the fancies of the community first .
Programming can be sexy , fun and for the common good but what usually turns out is a tool inflicted on the community as it met the need of one individual ( Yes I know RSSLibJ , one of mine , did this but I 've managed to deflate my ego now ) .
Then it 's only a matter of time before the koolaid wolves prowl around looking for the next API prey .
Northwest Airlines do n't report about " passengers drinking the Delta koolaid " to get their passengers to change heart .
They just get on and dream up the next competitive thing and get on with it .
In the last month I 've given a hard nosed sector a new way of working and trading , I do n't have to sell it to programmers , thank goodness .
Within a month it has been called " exciting " , " a brilliant idea " and my favourite , " the future of aerospace leasing " .
The move from " Java consultant " to " CEO " was a brave move , but the right one .
Enjoy your koolaid ... I never got to taste it .

End of story .
I think Apple has been feeding their users ( I'm a proud PowerBook owner ) sour Kool - Aid for a long time now .
Their products do kick ass , but not always in the way they 've been telling us they do .

The key for companies is not to drink their own Kool - Aid .
Apple did it and almost fell apart .
It is the toughest thing in the world to have zealots supporting you because you get a lot of rah- rah noise that can really keep the clean , need - to - know , need - to - innovate signals from getting through .
In the end , those that are impressive are never satisfied , never complacent , and never think they have the " right " way to do things .
They are always challenging both convention and their OWN ideas .

> No other sector apart from computer programming , that I know of , disses each other with the koolaid factor .
Actually , here in DC , " drinking the koolaid " is much more of a political term than one associated with computing .
Any person who aroused strong feelings on either side of the aisle ( Bush , Dean , McCain , etc. ) would have supporters who were accused of DtK constantly .
Amusingly , the term is actually more appropriate to politics because those who DtK often find themselves on the losing side later , because of all the enmity they 've aroused .
On the computer end , frequently those who DtK lose nothing , because the companies they adore ( Apple , Google , etc. ) tend to have either a high marketshare in whatever product is being adored or a high number of users who will ensure that said product does n't go out of business .
The problem occurs when the former disappears and only the latter remains .
( See the Amiga , the Newton , Netscape , etc. )

" Northwest Airlines do n't report about " passengers drinking the Delta koolaid " to get their passengers to change heart .

Jason -
I 'm still bogglng over seeing " Northwest Airlines " " Delta " and " the next competitive thing " in the same paragraph .
The airline industry , with some notable exceptions , is so full of examples of what not to do re competitive positioning , I almost feel sorry for them .
They may not call it " drinking the Koolaid " but you can bet the honchos at the big airlines get snarly when talking amongst themselves about SW ( and Jet Blue ) and their loyal customers .
Based on my experience - in multiple industry sectors - The Kool - Aid savaging is n't limited to programmers ( we even use the actual term " drinking the kool - aid " when behind closed doors ) .
And , do n't forget politics !
Great post and discussions .

Somebody told me once ( perhaps someone could confirm this ) that the meaning of the word " passion " in the original latin meant " suffering " .
If this is the case , I guess that once you have people copping a hard time because they use your product and fiercely stand by it , they are suffering for the sake of ( their love of ) your product .
And if they are suffering for your product in this fashion , BAM ! , you have Passionate Users / Clients / Customers etc .
( I do n't have time to read all the comments here , so if I 'm doubling up with point , sorry about that .
Love this site though Kathy , keep up the good work ! )

The Mac ’s stumble was in part because of pricing and in part because Mr. Jobs had intentionally restricted its expandability .
Despite his assertion that a slow data connection would be sufficient , the gamble failed when Apple ’s business stalled and Mr. Jobs was forced out of the company by the chief executive he had brought in , John Sculley .
In a similar fashion , Mr. Jobs is gambling that people will pay a premium ( $ 499 or $ 599 ) for the iPhone and appears to have sought to limit its expandability .
The device is not currently compatible with the faster 3G wireless data networks that are driving sharp gains in cellular revenues in the United States , although several Apple insiders said the phone could be upgraded to 3G with software if Apple later decides to do so .
Moreover , Mr. Jobs also appears to be restricting the potential for third - party software developers to write applications for the new handset — from ringtones to word processors .
To be sure , this strategy has not limited the success of the iPod , which has become the defining hand - held consumer appliance and fashion statement in the last half - decade .
The world of digital cellular phones , however , is rapidly becoming a simple extension of the world of personal computing .
The leading handset makers — Microsoft , Motorola , Nokia , Palm , Research in Motion , Samsung and Sony Ericsson — are all pushing in the direction of making their devices increasingly look like PCs you can put in your pocket .
Mr. Jobs is moving in that direction , too , but it appears that he wants to control his device much more closely than his competitors .
“ We define everything that is on the phone , ” he said .
“ You do n’t want your phone to be like a PC .
The last thing you want is to have loaded three apps on your phone and then you go to make a call and it does n’t work anymore .
These are more like iPods than they are like computers . ”
Three days ago , next to the gutted and destroyed house in Qana , seven bodies lay covered with bedsheets , a blanket and a prayer mat .
One small arm stretched out from under the sheets ; thin , the arm of a little girl , a piece of cloth like a bracelet wrapped around the wrist .
As bodies were loaded on the stretcher , I saw another dead girl ; she was dressed in a black shirt with a coloured scarf wrapped loosely around her head .
Her face was swollen .
In some ways I was relieved .
The rumour we had heard in the hotel in Tyre was that at least 40 people , half of them children , had been in the house in Qana when it was bombed by Israeli planes , and here I was an hour later , with Red Cross workers and others running up and down , and all I could see was the bodies of two girls and five adults .
It 's weird , the things that make you feel better in the south of Lebanon , but seven dead instead of 40 gave me a sense of relief .
But even as I stood there registering that emotion , hellish scenes were unfolding .
Four medics carried a little boy by on an orange stretcher : he was perhaps 12 years old , dressed in black shorts and a white T - shirt with a coloured motorcycle on it .
His arms were stretched behind his head , but apart from the bruises on his face and the swollen lips , he looked OK .
For half a second I told myself , as I tell myself every time I see death , that he was just sleeping , and that he would be fine .
But he was dead .
Then came two more boys in the arms of the rescuers .
One of them , the younger , around eight years old , had his arms close to his chest , his nose and mouth covered with blood .
The elder , around 10 , had dirt and debris in his mouth .
Their slight bodies were put on a blanket , the head of the younger boy left resting on the shoulder of the elder , then four men carried the blanket off , stopping twice to rest as they took them away .
The bodies of the boys were piled with other corpses in the back of an ambulance .
Two more small dead boys followed them .
The medics were running out of stretchers , so they piled the corpses of the boys on one orange stretcher .
One of the kids was slightly chubby ; he was wearing a red T - shirt and shorts .
His head rested on the lap of the younger , who was about six years old ; both had the same exploding lips , covered with blood and dirt .
It was obvious to everyone that these boys were not sleeping .
Then another child was pulled from under the rubble , and another followed , and then another .
You go a little crazy when you see little body after little body coming up out of the ground .
I looked around me and all I could see in the house was the detritus of their short lives - big plastic bags filled with clothes , milk cans , plastic toys and a baby carriage .
By three in the afternoon , when the corpse of a one - year - old boy was pulled from the rubble , he looked more like a mud statue than a child .
The medics held him high above their heads , clear of the rubble .
The faces of the rescue workers said everything that needed to be said .
What is obvious to everyone covering this conflict is that children are bearing the brunt of it .
The few official figures collated so far seem to support this .
Unicef says that 37 of the 60 dead in Qana on Sunday were children , and everywhere you go , it seems that it is the children who are being killed , injured and displaced .
Yesterday the Lebanese government said that of the 828 of its civilians killed in the conflict so far , around 35 % have been children - that 's around 290 .
Unicef also estimates that about a third of the dead have been children , although it bases that figure on the fact that an estimated 30 % of Lebanon 's population are children , rather than any actual count of the dead .
There are no official figures yet for the number of wounded children , but they will certainly exceed the number killed ; as for those displaced , Unicef says that 45 % of the estimated 900,000 Lebanese to have fled their homes are children .
Aid agencies believe that the reason children are suffering so much in this conflict is because of the big families that are traditional in south Lebanon .
" You are not talking about nuclear families , you are talking about families huddling together with four , five or six children .
Inevitably , a high percentage of children are killed , " says Anis Salem , a Unicef spokesman .
" We estimate that before Qana , 30 % of the deaths were children , but it is a very fluid situation and that figure can quickly become redundant . "
It is not just a matter of many children huddled together , of course : with numbers come all sorts of problems .
If an air raid is coming , and you are running , how many children can you pick up and carry with you ?
How many do you have to leave behind ?
Children often suffer most in wars like this - wars in which civilians suffer heavy casualties .
They are weaker , they may be too small to run or walk , they may suffer more on long journeys by foot .
And as Amelia Bookstein , head of humanitarian policy at Save the Children , points out : " Children who are wounded , separated from their families , or traumatised , may be too frightened or unable to flee their homes . "
There are the official statistics , and then there are the children , who seem to be everywhere in the heart of this conflict , all with their own , painful , awful stories .
A week ago I met Abbas Sha'ito , a chubby 12 - year - old boy in a bright orange T - shirt who was sitting on the side of a road south of Tyre , blood covering his face , his T - shirt torn by the bomb that had hit the minivan he had been in .
He and 17 others had been inside ; his mother , brother and aunt were all injured , moaning and in agony a few feet away .
Inside the minivan remained the headless corpse of his uncle , and the bodies of his grandmother and another man who had been fleeing with them .
Abbas was weeping , and had an arm round his mother , who seemed to be fading fast : she was injured in the chest and head , and one of her arms was almost severed at the bicep .
" Do n't leave me , mother , " the boy wept .
" Do n't go , do n't go . "
It was clear that his mother believed herself to be close to death .
" Take care of your brothers and sisters , " she said to Abbas .
" Do n't leave me , " Abbas kept saying .
" My purse is under me .
There is money , take care of it , " his mother said ; as she did , her head began drooping , and Abbas screamed , and a medic rushed in : " Do n't cry , do n't cry , she will be OK .
Just keep talking to her , " the medic said .
As it is , Abbas 's mother is still alive , although still in intensive care , but Abbas was not to know this then .
He buried his face in his hands and wept , while his brother Ali stood nearby , one hand bandaged and his eyes on the horizon .
Last Wednesday , in a hospital in Tyre , I met Samah Shihab , a seven - year - old girl with beautiful long eyelashes from the hamlet of Mlooka near Tyre .
She was in the yard of her house with her two brothers , aged four and nine , and her 14 - year - old sister , when a shell fell .
" I was playing with my sister and brothers when the rocket came , " said Samah .
" They started screaming and crying .
There was pressure in my ears and my hands and legs were all in blood .
I was scared .
My brother was screaming and I was scared . "
According to her doctors , Samah , who was badly burned and needs skin grafts on her legs , is unlikely to walk again .
On Monday I met Ali ( he did n't give me a second name ) , who is nine and had been hiding in the basement of his house , along with his aunts , his grandmother and an uncle with learning difficulties , for 20 days in the village of Bint Jbeil .
While the family hid below , war raged above : the village has suffered the heaviest shelling of anywhere in the south of Lebanon , as well as intense street battles between Israeli soldiers and Hizbullah fighters .
When Ali emerged from the basement on Monday , during a brief halt to the aerial bombardment , he was visibly frightened and shocked , and seemed unable to recognise his surroundings .
As he made his first steps on the big chunks of rubble and concrete strewn everywhere , clutching a bottle of water in one arm and a blue bag in the other , he began shaking and crying .
His grandfather , who was leading him through the rubble , collapsed in the shade of a doorway , and Ali and other family members continued their walk to the Red Cross vehicles - parked a kilometre away , at the edge of the village , beyond the edge of the vast and almost impassable rubble field - without him .
I walked with them .
As we walked , jumping from one boulder to the other , Ali said : " My father and mother went with my other brothers and sisters to another town .
They said they will come and get me when the bombs stop . "
In the scorching sunshine above , Israeli jets were flying , their sound mixed with that of the drones .
Suddenly a thud came from the hills and Ali froze .
" They are going to bomb again ! "
He started to cry .
" Why are the Israelis hitting us ?
Do they hate us ?
My cousin Mahmoud called me on the phone and he told me that the nuclear bombs are really big .
Are they as big as these rockets ? "
It 's hard to convey quite how shocked , perhaps quite literally shell - shocked - this little boy was .
He was almost delusional .
We reached the town square .
There was a large , deep crater on one side of it , and a half - destroyed petrol station on the other .
Burnt - out cars lay flipped over on to their sides .
A few hundred metres later we had to stop for a rest .
Ali opened his blue bag and got out a small green bottle of mineral water .
It had only a few centimetres left , but he sipped some and passed it to me .
I was about to throw the bottle away when he said , " No , no , this is my charm - it 's green , the colour of Imam Hussein . "
( Imam Hussein was the grandson of the prophet Muhammad ; he is central to the Shia faith , and a great symbol of martyrdom . )
A few hundred metres further on we reached the Red Cross ambulances .
Ali squeezed in with his aunts and other women and children ; they were to be taken to the displacement centres in Sidon and Beirut .
Ali , it turned out , was fortunate .
As I left town , I saw , all along the road , children and their families who had been forced to walk to safety .
One father was pushing a wheelbarrow with four young children inside .
In another hospital in Tyre , which has seen 120 injured and 35 dead so far , I meet the young son of the head of the hospital .
Muhammad Najem , 11 , spends his days inside where it 's safe , because a week ago a car was hit by a missile on the road directly outside the hospital .
Muhammad draws on a computer : his latest drawing is of Hizbullah fighter .
Next to the fighter is a star of David stabbed with a dagger - blood drips down into a vat full of blood marked " Hell " .
His elder brother Ali Najem , a fourth - year medical student in his 20s , is rueful .
" The Israelis are planting very bad hatred in the children against Israel , " he says .
Ali has spent the past three weeks documenting the stories of the children who have passed injured or with their injured families through his father 's hospital .
He particularly remembers one boy , aged about seven , who was caught in a convoy that was hit in the first days of the bombing .
This boy described to him , quite calmly , " as if it were a cartoon " , how a baby from the car in front of them was ejected out of the window when the vehicle was hit .
The boy 's father had been killed at the scene .
Ali also talks about the impact on women delivering babies in the midst of conflict .
In the first week of the war one of them named her new son Intisar , which means victory .
In the past week , two new names have been given to newborns at this hospital : " Wahid , which means ' the lonely ' , and Dayaa , which means ' the lost ' . "
The woman who gave birth to Dayaa did so alone , having been separated from her husband somewhere in the Bekaa Valley .
Ali says that she became disturbed , and called out to her husband : " If you do n't come and take me out of this place , I will put myself under these bombs and kill myself and the baby . "
For newborns , as well as for the older children , the scars of this war are going to take a long time to fade .
So who is responsible for the secret hold on Russ Feingold 's bipartisan electronic disclosure bill ?
Our process of elimination whittled it down to Sens. Jon Kyl ( R - AZ ) and Judd Gregg ( R - NH ) , so when Kyl firmly denied it yesterday , it was over , right ?
Wrong ! , says the Washington Post :
Before dawn , the [ Sunlight Foundation ] group sent an e-mail blast to 200 members who live in New Hampshire and Arizona and they started dialing .
" Kyl said , ' It 's not me , ' about an hour after that , " said Ellen S. Miller , the executive director .
But from Gregg , there was silence .
At 5 p.m. , his spokeswoman , Erin Rath , replied to a reporter 's inquiry by e-mail : " As a matter of practice , Senator Gregg does not use secret holds . "
But in this instance ?
" No , " she replied .
So , whodunit ?
" Is it possible that someone lied to one of their constituents saying they were not the person who placed a hold on the bill ?
That is always possible , " Miller said .
" But I 'd be astounded by it . "
We are faced with two options in this detour , each with its own pros and cons .
In Call Everyone , we can call every Republican Senator again and repeat this work from scratch to make sure each has firmly , concretely and unmistakably denied being the Senator who requested the hold .
This option may take a lot of time , but it eventually will lead to the correct answer , assuming each office is telling the truth .
Our second option is Operation Bluegrass .
Because , as it turns out , there is one Republican Senator who absolutely knows who 's responsible for this hold , and it 's Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - KY ) , who has never been a fan of campaign finance regulation of any kind , though he has claimed to support this bill .
Both Sens. Lamar !
Alexander ( R - TN ) and Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) have confirmed that McConnell knows who 's responsible for the hold .
So in Operation Bluegrass , you just call Sen. McConnell 's office at ( 202 ) 224-2541 and ask them : which one of your Senators is responsible for the anonymous hold ?
are you responsible for the denial of unanimous consent ?
Be civil , but be firm , and let us know what they tell you .
Sen .
McConnell is up for reelection next year and already knows he 's vulnerable , and your calls can influence him to do the right thing .
One anonymous Senator can't be allowed the ability to hold up this simple , bipartisan legislation .
Make the call .
edited to add : If you 're going to call other Senators ' offices , two tips :

' I Was Certain , But I Was Wrong ' — by Jennifer Thompson
Her powerful New York Times Op - Ed page essay of June 18 , 2000 has become a classic .
It 's been featured here on September 16 , 2004 , March 18 , 2005 and May 8 , 2006 .
Once a year seems about right to me for this important document .
Yesterday 's post about the increasing fallibility of memory and eyewitness testimony as we age brought it to mind ; it bears reposting .
I Was Certain , but I Was Wrong
In 1984 I was a 22 - year - old college student with a grade point average of 4.0 , and I really wanted to do something with my life .
One night someone broke into my apartment , put a knife to my throat and raped me .
During my ordeal , some of my determination took an urgent new direction .
I studied every single detail on the rapist 's face .
I looked at his hairline ; I looked for scars , for tattoos , for anything that would help me identify him .
When and if I survived the attack , I was going to make sure that he was put in prison and he was going to rot .
When I went to the police department later that day , I worked on a composite sketch to the very best of my ability .
I looked through hundreds of noses and eyes and eyebrows and hairlines and nostrils and lips .
Several days later , looking at a series of police photos , I identified my attacker .
I knew this was the man .
I was completely confident .
I was sure .
I picked the same man in a lineup .
Again , I was sure .
I knew it .
I had picked the right guy , and he was going to go to jail .
If there was the possibility of a death sentence , I wanted him to die .
I wanted to flip the switch .
When the case went to trial in 1986 , I stood up on the stand , put my hand on the Bible and swore to tell the truth .
Based on my testimony , Ronald Junior Cotton was sentenced to prison for life .
It was the happiest day of my life because I could begin to put it all behind me .
In 1987 , the case was retried because an appellate court had overturned Ronald Cotton 's conviction .
During a pretrial hearing , I learned that another man had supposedly claimed to be my attacker and was bragging about it in the same prison wing where Ronald Cotton was being held .
This man , Bobby Poole , was brought into court , and I was asked , '' Ms. Thompson , have you ever seen this man ? ' '
I answered : '' I have never seen him in my life .
I have no idea who he is . ''
Ronald Cotton was sentenced again to two life sentences .
Ronald Cotton was never going to see light ; he was never going to get out ; he was never going to hurt another woman ; he was never going to rape another woman .
In 1995 , 11 years after I had first identified Ronald Cotton , I was asked to provide a blood sample so that DNA tests could be run on evidence from the rape .
I agreed because I knew that Ronald Cotton had raped me and DNA was only going to confirm that .
The test would allow me to move on once and for all .
I will never forget the day I learned about the DNA results .
I was standing in my kitchen when the detective and the district attorney visited .
They were good and decent people who were trying to do their jobs — as I had done mine , as anyone would try to do the right thing .
They told me : '' Ronald Cotton did n't rape you .
It was Bobby Poole . ''
The man I was so sure I had never seen in my life was the man who was inches from my throat , who raped me , who hurt me , who took my spirit away , who robbed me of my soul .
And the man I had identified so emphatically on so many occasions was absolutely innocent .
Ronald Cotton was released from prison after serving 11 years .
Bobby Poole pleaded guilty to raping me .
Ronald Cotton and I are the same age , so I knew what he had missed during those 11 years .
My life had gone on .
I had gotten married .
I had graduated from college .
I worked .
I was a parent .
Ronald Cotton had n't gotten to do any of that .
Mr. Cotton and I have now crossed the boundaries of both the terrible way we came together and our racial difference ( he is black and I am white ) and have become friends .
Although he is now moving on with his own life , I live with constant anguish that my profound mistake cost him so dearly .
I cannot begin to imagine what would have happened had my mistaken identification occurred in a capital case .
Today there is a man in Texas named Gary Graham who is about to be executed because one witness is confident that Mr. Graham is the killer she saw from 30 to 40 feet away .
This woman saw the murderer for only a fraction of the time that I saw the man who raped me .
Several other witnesses contradict her , but the jury that convicted Mr. Graham never heard any of the conflicting testimony .
If anything good can come out of what Ronald Cotton suffered because of my limitations as a human being , let it be an awareness of the fact that eyewitnesses can and do make mistakes .
I have now had occasion to study this subject a bit , and I have come to realize that eyewitness error has been recognized as the leading cause of wrongful convictions .
One witness is not enough , especially when her story is contradicted by other good people .
Last week , I traveled to Houston to beg Gov. George W. Bush and his parole board not to execute Gary Graham based on this kind of evidence .
I have never before spoken out on behalf of any inmate .
I stood with a group of 11 men and women who had been convicted based on mistaken eyewitness testimony , only to be exonerated later by DNA or other evidence .
With them , I urged the Texas officials to grant Gary Graham a new trial , so that the eyewitnesses who are so sure that he is innocent can at long last be heard .
I know that there is an eyewitness who is absolutely positive she saw Gary Graham commit murder .
But she cannot possibly be any more positive than I was about Ronald Cotton .
What if she is dead wrong ?

How about the shortcut to what the article really should have exposed -- the idea of frying a person ( quite literally what electrocution is like ) is fairly inhumane and repugnant .
Capital punishment is inadequate because in these situations , the wrongly accused 's vindication wo n't be to leave prison , it 'll be spending their eternity in the grave as innocent .

This article amply illustrates the pitfalls of any criminal justice system , the need for immediate " justice " .
The only good that has come of this is the recognition that we can be wrong ...

Firstly , I want to thank you for this post .
Jennifer Thompson has shown tremendous courage coming forward and telling her story and she should be commended for it by every person who can find an ounce of civility in their bones .
Secondly , I cannot believe the ignorance and sheer audacity of some of the comments on this post .
How it has managed to become a political attack on Islam is beyond me .
I myself am neither Christian nor Muslim , but I am astounded at the bigotry and venom expressed in these statements .
To Hazir , who quotes the Koran without context , it is easy to do this with most texts , Certainly , the Bible and the Torah are full of statements such as these .
Equally , some of our greatest heroes and advocates of peace can be quoted to sound like ranting racists :
" Kaffirs are as a rule uncivilized - the convicts even more so .
They are troublesome , very dirty and live almost like animals . "
Ghandi
or by leaving out portion of a quote , mongerers of hatred :
" People must learn to hate ... " Nelson Mandela .
" People must learn to hate , and if they can learn to hate , they can be taught to love , for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite . "
Nelson Mandela

Indeed Blaat !
Begone you purveyors of magic and myth .
If she could be SO wrong , could't you ?
The only effect is to detract from the point of the story .

What the heck has religion to do with ' justice ' .
These should be independent .

Thanks for sharing this .
Your anguish clearly has inspired some purpose .
Mr. Cotton 's imprisonment and your mutual suffering may save many lives .
There 's exceptional reward in that thought .

In Islam , the testimony of a woman is considered worth half of that of a man .
" Kill the unbelievers wherever you find them " -- The Koran

A 19 - year - old Saudi woman who was kidnapped , beaten and gang raped by seven men who then took photos of their victim and threatened to kill her , was sentenced under the country 's Islamic - based law to 90 lashes for the " crime " of being alone with a man not related to her .

Very powerful ; thanks for sharing .
Too many people have lost their liberty or even their lives due to faulty eyewitness testimony .
So - called " circumstancial evidence " is often far more reliable .

Has it been almost another year .
Time flies for me , not for the wrongly incarcerated or accused .
This article was a life - changing read for me when I first read it three years ago ( or was it last week ? ) .
Keep it coming , Joe !

Actually 4 is not always required .
This is a common myth .
Different crimes have different requirements .
A fewer number of witnesses and scientific evidence , such as DNA tests and medical reports are also allowed .
Posted by : anonymous | Mar 6 , 2007 4:11:01 PM
This is why Islam requires 4 witnesses or a confession for all crimes .
God knows best .

Jamaican police yesterday stepped up their efforts to catch the killer or killers of Bob Woolmer by announcing plans to gather DNA samples , fingerprints and photographs of everyone who was staying in the 300 - room Pegasus Hotel in Kingston at the time of the Pakistan coach 's murder 11 days ago .
" It is a huge task but I believe it has to be done , " said Mark Shields , the deputy commissioner of Jamaican police .
" I am hoping that when the forensic report is through and we have studied it we will find fingerprints and also DNA of a suspect .
If people were in that room innocently or not at all then the easiest way to eliminate them is by getting those samples now . "
Shields admitted that the job , which may involve as many as 1,000 guests , could take months and he would not rule out a second autopsy after the first was declared inconclusive by a forensic pathologist .
" The jury may want a second post - mortem and if we arrest someone this week and charge them the defence counsel will want a second , " he said .
The move comes amid suggestions from members of the Pakistan Cricket Board that Woolmer was not in fact murdered at all but died of natural causes .
However , Shields is adamant that there is " clear evidence of murder " .
He admitted it was unusual that there were no signs of bruising on Woolmer 's neck but told Reuters : " There are circumstances surrounding this [ case ] which render it not so unusual .
" There was no forced entry to the room , which is a very clear indication that two things happened .
One is that the person let themselves into the room using one of the key cards , or secondly that Bob opened the room himself .
As far as I can say at this stage there is no record of anybody else opening the door .
So therefore we can assume that he let the person in . "
Meanwhile , a crowd of 200 angry fans gathered at Karachi airport to shower six members of the returning Pakistan squad with abuse .
Shahid Afridi , the all - rounder who played only in the meaningless victory over Zimbabwe , was told to " go to hell " and others chanted , " Afridi , sell lentils , " and " Deserter , where are you going ? "
The leg - spinner Danish Kaneria was greeted with cries of " Shame , shame " and on Monday the vice - captain Younis Khan was advised by one fan that he should ride around Karachi on a donkey .

Former Iraqi soldier describes the day the Americans came
2007-04-05 14:13:17 PDT
BAGHDAD --
On April 5 , 2003 , American forces fighting their way up to Baghdad arrived at the city of Aziziyah in southern Iraq , home of Nizar Latif , then a 22 - year - old member of one of Saddam Hussein 's militias .
Now a correspondent for the Chronicle Foreign Service , he writes about the events of that day four years ago .
The war had been coming for a long time .
We could hear its approach from afar , like a distant tidal wave heading inevitably in our direction .
We had been listening to the radio ; heard the Americans and the British crossing in from Kuwait , landing in the port of Umm Qasr , fighting their way north .
One day they were 100 miles away , then 40 .
It was at 2 a.m on April 5 that the wave finally broke on top of us , American planes attacking the Iraqi armored units and troops that were dug in on the outskirts of town .
Everything evaporated under the bombs .
The steel of tanks and artillery pieces disintegrated , the people atomized .
I watched in mute amazement as a tank was hit by a missile ; nothing was left behind , not a scrap .
The air strikes continued for hours .
I worried about my family but more than that , I was scared for myself , I wanted the ground to swallow me up , to take me from that place .
The bombardment finally stopped at 7 a.m. , leaving us stunned and disoriented .
I walked around , surveying the damage .
I smelled the burned corpses before I saw them , less numerous that I had expected .
I do n't know how many people had died that morning .
No one does .
I was 22 years old and , together with many of my friends , had been forced into service as a member of the so - called Jerusalem Army , a badly organized , poorly equipped and trained militia .
We were the second line of defense for Aziziyah .
First was the regular army , positioned in front of us .
To our rear were Saddam 's fanatical , murderous Fedayeen , a unit that had been shipped in from Ramadi .
More than fighting the Americans , they were there to impose discipline on the rest of us .
We had no intention of defending Saddam - the man who destroyed our country , who slaughtered our people -- and he knew it .
The Fadayeen were there to stop us deserting .
If we tried to run , they had made it clear they would shoot us .
Between a rock and a hard place , we expected to be killed either by the Americans in front the Saddamists behind .
So we did the only thing possible -- we stayed and we tried not to die .
At 11 a.m. , U.S. ground forces attacked .
Under cover of helicopters , they advanced at great speed .
Some Iraqis tried to defend our lines , using rocket - propelled grenades against the oncoming armored vehicles .
A few were hit and destroyed .
An American helicopter came in low as I watched the machine - gunner firing out of the door at a group of fleeing Iraqi soldiers ; they had dropped their rifles , stripped off their uniforms and were in their underwear .
All of them were cut down by the bullets .
At that point the Fedayeen -- supposedly willing martyrs in Sadddam 's cause -- began to abandon their posts .
It was chaos , everyone suddenly trying to get away .
I also ran .
I tore off my uniform and threw away my weapon .
In my underwear , I slipped away from what had been my fighting position .
Down the road I found an empty house and hid inside for a few hours .
I ate some food and found some clothes .
They did n't fit but I wore them anyway .
Once again , the sound of helicopters and shooting .
From the window I watched an Iraqi standing in the open , firing a machine gun up into the air .
Three helicopters circled overhead , pouring tracers down at him .
For seemingly a long time he did n't fall , but then he was gone and the helicopters left .
In the silence I started to walk home .
To my relief
I found my family -- they had all survived .
At 4 p.m. , the first U.S. troops arrived in the centre of Aziziyah , saying hello .
They were all very nice and I remember that we were surprised .
They gave sweets to the children .
We had n't expected that , had n't expected politeness .
Some of the townspeople waved at the troops and one of the soldiers asked if anyone spoke English .
I did and was pushed forward .
He politely asked me if I knew where any Iraqi soldiers were hiding .
I had no idea and told him so .
Then he asked about the Fedayeen and I told him they were from Ramadi and had run away .
He thanked me and went off .
An hour later , the Americans found the town police station and broke open the locks .
Iraqis followed them in and began looting , taking anything that was n't bolted down .
The Americans waved the mob through , laughing at the spectacle .
As night fell , a deep blackness engulfed the city and consumed our hearts .
Terrible things happened in Aziziyah , things that still make me feel sick and ashamed today .
Under the cover of dark , normal people hunted down the Baathists .
These men had ruled by fear , they had condemned brothers and sons to death , they had made our lives an exitless hell .
We all hated them .
That night , they were murdered .
All of those who could be found were shot or stabbed .
At least 35 corpses were added to the country 's growing pile of dead .
I saw one man , screaming with grief , take a knife and plunge it again and again into a Baathist officer 's chest .
He had lost a brother to Saddam 's regime , and shouted : " You murdered my brother and tore my heart apart .
This is how it feels , this is how it feels . "
He kept slashing at the body long after the life in it must have departed .
That was four years ago .
We thought we had been liberated .
Americans could walk through our city in total peace , without weapons , without fear or fighting .
Now , all that has changed .
U.S. soldiers are not welcome here and they do not come .
Liberation is not a word anyone uses .
It is not a word we understand .

It was an unfamiliar pain , sharp and persistent , as if a rag were being twisted inside his abdomen .
Tighter and tighter , crunching in on his organs , enough to wake Andrew Ondrejcak one morning in 2004 before his alarm went off .
Indigestion ?
No , probably it was a return of the stomach ulcers that had plagued him as an undergrad a few years back .
Ulcers felt somewhat different , it ’s true , more an isolated stabbing compared with the lateral serrations currently tormenting him .
But it had been a while ; you forget the specifics of pain .
Whatever it was , Ondrejcak , who was 24 , worried he might have to see a doctor , something he made a point to avoid .
Like 47 million other Americans , including most everyone he knew , Ondrejcak did not have health insurance .
Telling himself the pain was nothing , he walked to Sweet Melissa , a bakery on Court Street , where he made $ 6 an hour plus tips .
He had come to New York from Mississippi , hoping to become a designer — maybe in theater , maybe fashion — but for the time being , he paid his rent ( barely ) by serving pastries .
“ Health insurance was n’t even an option , ” Ondrejcak told me recently .
“ I was flying through my savings , trying to get a career started .
I was doing a lot of assisting designers who were doing great work , but I was n’t making anything .
The last thing I ’m going to do is spend $ 300 or whatever on insurance , you know ? ”
He paused before adding , “ I ’m a healthy person , I rarely get sick .
I run , I do yoga .
I take all the vitamins .
Honestly , I never thought about it . ”
At Sweet Melissa , the pain only worsened .
But what to do ?
How to even find a doctor ?
Only one - third of the uninsured have a regular physician , and he was not among them .
He searched the Yellow Pages for doctors in Brooklyn with the prefix gastro near their names ; most would n’t take him .
Eventually , he found a public clinic — a friend had been there — that recommended a specialist in Bay Ridge .
“ It ’s probably ulcers , ” the doctor said , after Ondrejcak said he suspected ulcers .
He was given a prescription for Nexium ( $ 73 ) along with a depressing bill of $ 200 for the visit .
“ Basically all the money I ’d made that week .
I left keeling over in pain but took the bus home because I was so broke , ” he told me .
He swallowed the Nexium with a swig of Maalox and went to bed , hoping the pill would rewire whatever was wrong .
Just before midnight , Ondrejcak woke in distress .
Needling , jabbing , the pain was corrosive .
“ I crawled to my bathroom and tried to throw up because it hurt so bad , ” he recalled .
“ I was in my underwear on my bathroom floor calling my neighbor who had keys to my apartment . ”
The neighbor phoned for a livery cab , asking the driver to take them to a hospital , any hospital , whichever was closest .
Ten minutes later , Ondrejcak staggered into Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn Heights .
The desk attendant was blunt : No insurance ?
Wait in the emergency room .
Ondrejcak had wondered about such a scenario — a sudden emergency , no safety net , the classic nightmare among the uninsured — but until now the thoughts were fleeting , theoretical .
No way it would actually happen .
It ’s tempting to view a mind - set like Ondrejcak ’s as purely a symptom of youth .
The young are naturally resilient and among the least likely to have a serious medical condition — as far as priorities go , health insurance tends to reside in a muddled region of the mind along with other abstract concepts : retirement savings , mortgage payments , marriage , death .
But this is only part of the story .
Those coming of age today are entering an economy where many of the old rules no longer apply .
The paternalistic corporate culture of the past ( full - time staff members supported for the long haul ) has been largely replaced by a frenetic “ permalance ” model , the strivers and thrivers encouraged to jump from one company to the next as needed .
There was a time when a health plan symbolized something — you were making it — but now benefits are scarce at many levels .
For the young who do n’t luck into a job that offers coverage , a certain outlook becomes inevitable : Premiums are a fortune , you can barely pay your rent , you rarely need a doctor , you decide to gamble .
It ’s a state of mind so common , in fact , that the insurance industry has a name for it : Ondrejcak is one of the “ young invincibles , ” those who , betting they can get through their twenties relatively unscathed , “ choose ” to go without insurance .
They are the fastest - growing segment of America ’s uninsured population .
There is , of course , a great deal of talk these days about health care .
Open a newspaper and you ’ll find op - eds sermonizing about the coverage crisis , a poll dissecting public dissatisfaction , a study offering grim statistics ( “ Since 2000 , the ranks of the uninsured have grown by 6.8 million … ” ) , and yet another politician laying out a plan for universal care .
Compared with small children , uninsured young workers are generally ineffective as political sympathy - generators and are therefore typically viewed as a footnote to the debate .
But health - care analysts will tell you that insuring children , while certainly noble , is a relatively easy goal .
“ What a lot of people do n’t realize , ” says Peter Cunningham , a researcher at the Washington , D.C. –based Center for Studying Health System Change , “ is that most children are already eligible for some form of care .
They either qualify for Medicaid or can be insured under their parents ’ plan .
So in many respects , it ’s a matter of making the paperwork clearer , not overhauling the system . ”
The young invincibles , on the other hand , are an example of how the system bypasses some groups altogether .
In this they are not alone — the poor have a long history of inadequate care , and increasingly , middle - class families are finding themselves priced out — though to understand their bind is to see just how ineffective the current system has become .

“ People tend to trivialize the issue , ” says Karen Davis , president of the Commonwealth Fund , a research foundation that recently published a comprehensive report on uninsured young adults .
“ The most common misperception is that they ’re pretty healthy all in all and end up getting decent care without insurance .
Yes , when you ’re injured in an accident , you wo n’t be left in the street .
But getting good rehab ?
That may not be an option .
Most of the uninsured are n’t getting regular Pap smears , they skip tests and treatments , they tend to end up in the emergency room because they wait until the last possible minute — they are developing unhealthy habits that are likely to stick with them as they grow up and start having more - serious health problems . ”
New York , unsurprisingly , is an especially fertile breeding ground for the uninsured young .
“ A lot of the professions that draw young people to New York — everything from retail to the arts to restaurants to software development — tend to have spottier coverage , ” says James R. Tallon , the president of the United Hospital Fund , a health - care think tank .
Even large corporations are increasingly reluctant to offer coverage .
( At a company like MTV , for instance , many full - time employees work in a nebulous state of hourly wages and no benefits , an arrangement that can last years . )
Those without employer - sponsored coverage are thrown into a market where individual premiums can cost anywhere from $ 250 ( for a bare - bones catastrophic policy ) to $ 900 a month , among the highest rates in the nation , and likely out of reach for someone just starting out .
And so going without health coverage becomes one of those casual sacrifices that come with being young in New York — on par with funneling half your income into a 400 - square - foot apartment .
As an informal litmus test , I recently sent an e-mail to a handful of people in their twenties asking three vague questions :
Are you uninsured ?
Know someone who is ?
How has it affected your life ?
Forward it to anyone , I encouraged .
I imagined I would get a fair number of replies — one in four New Yorkers is uninsured , so I was n’t exactly shooting in the dark , and as a 27 - year - old former young invincible myself , I had an undoubtedly skewed sample — but I was unprepared for the sheer volume of response : more than 100 replies within a couple of days , mostly from people I had never met .
There were complaints , conspiracy theories , details of unpaid debts , stories of untreated injuries , shoddy care , one insurance - inspired marriage ( he needed surgery ) , and , in the case of a musician friend , wisdom teeth that should have been pulled years ago .
The messages led to interviews with more than 50 uninsured New Yorkers .
If there was a dominant theme to these conversations , it was that being uninsured has a distinct way of tweaking one ’s perception of the city : New York becomes a kind of phobia - forming obstacle course , one navigated with the goal of keeping doctors at bay .
Nichole Schulze , a 31 - year - old former publicist and current student at the Fashion Institute of Technology , was quick to rattle off a battery of quasi-logical preventive measures : “ You wo n’t see me snowboarding or mountain biking or even jaywalking .
My friends think I ’m a freak because I ’m the only person in New York who actually waits until the light changes to cross the street .
Oh , and I eat a kiwi every morning because I read somewhere that they contain twice the vitamin C of oranges .
And if it ’s snowing ?
I ’m the one walking on the inside of the sidewalk , just in case a cab decides to swerve and hop the curb . ”
Should any of these methods fail ?
“ I carry an expired Blue Cross card in my wallet .
You never know , maybe they ’ll think I have insurance and I ’ll get better care . ”
Andrew Kuo , a 29 - year - old painter , told me he made a vow to be insured by the time he turned 30 .
“ But that was when 30 seemed like a ways away , ” he added .
“ Now I find myself making all these stupid calculations .
Like , it would cost me around $ 3,000 a year to have insurance , right ?
Okay , is n’t that about what it would cost out of pocket if I broke my wrist ?
Chances are I ’m not going to break my wrist once a year , so why not save the money for that onetime emergency ? ”
Like many I spoke with , Kuo said he ’d happily pay for insurance , if only the cost - benefit analysis tilted more in its favor .
“ What ’s ironic is that I would never live without my cell phone , but I wo n’t consider buying health insurance .
It sounds ridiculous to say that out loud , but the fact is insurance is just too expensive .
If it was the same price as my phone ” — $ 150 a month sounded reasonable to him —
“ I ’d buy it in a second . ”

The common assumption is that the exorbitant rates are schemed up by the politically influential executives governing the trillion - dollar insurance industry .
But if insurers could target cheaper plans at younger New Yorkers , they would : Every business thrives by exploiting untapped markets .
State law , however , requires insurers to follow a “ community rating ” system that throws everyone — young , old , sick , healthy — into one risk pool .
“ The whole point of insurance is that you ’re pooling the risk to spread out the costs for everyone , ” explains Cunningham .
“ If you target healthier groups with favorable policies , you ’re likely going to make it more expensive for the older , less - healthy populations who need regular care . ”
Of course , if the young and healthy do n’t buy policies at all , who ’s balancing the costs ?
Recognizing this Catch - 22 , some states have adopted a more flexible “ age banding ” system , allowing insurers to customize packages based on age .
WellPoint recently created a youth - centric program called Tonik , with plans as low as $ 67 a month , but it ’s currently only available in eight states .
According to the Commonwealth Fund report , nearly 60 percent of uninsured young adults ( ages 19 to 29 ) say they have gone without health care because of the cost .
Deny the symptoms until they vanish : Such becomes the standard protocol , supplemented by a regimen of self - diagnosis and self - treatment .
Trent MacNamara , a 27 - year - old fact - checker at GQ , was riding his bike down lower Fifth Avenue last year when the door of a garbage truck opened in his path , knocking him off his bike and into the middle of the road , where the Jeep Cherokee behind him ran over his forearm .
MacNamara was wearing a helmet and remained conscious ; remarkably , no bones were broken .
“ Once I realized I was more or less all right , the first thing that went through my head was that I did n’t have insurance , ” he told me .
“ When the paramedics arrived , I pleaded with them to let me go .
I kept asking if they thought I had broken ribs , and they kept saying they were n’t qualified .
Finally , they told me that if I could breathe without pain , they probably were n’t broken .
I promised them I would walk to the hospital .
I just limped to the subway and went home . ”
And when forgoing treatment is n’t an option ?
The term medical clinic does n’t evoke much comfort , but when it comes to affordable care , New York has more options than most cities .
A few weeks ago , I spent an afternoon at the Ryan Chelsea - Clinton Community Health Center , a public clinic in Hell ’s Kitchen where about half the patients are uninsured .
While giving a tour of the facility ( pastel décor , patient - made art , multilingual signage ) , Dr. Andrew Gotlin , the chief physician , told me that the 50 or so walk - ins who pass through the waiting area daily tend to be under 35 and “ often not what people picture when they think of the uninsured ” : waiter - photographers , bartender - playwrights , aspiring graphic artists , and “ a lot of actors who ’ve had small roles on Law & Order . ”
Most come in for “ episodic care , ” he told me , a delicate way of saying the center is a last resort .
“ That ’s one of the biggest problems for the uninsured — they do n’t get any preventive care , ” Gotlin said .
“ We try to encourage it , but even at our rates ” — $ 32 to $ 92 a visit , depending on income — “ it becomes a pretty hard sell .
I would say the majority of patients do n’t come back for needed follow - ups . ”
One of the staff physicians , a mellow , well - dressed man named Aashish Dadarwala , told me a chilling story to underscore the public - health ramifications of Gotlin ’s point .
“ I had someone come in six months ago , a young , healthy - looking woman , ” he said .
“ She was 28 , I think .
She had had a nasty cough for a while but did n’t want to get it checked out because of the costs .
When it did n’t go away , she decided to come in .
I gave her all the tests — one of the great things about this place is that none of that costs extra — just to rule out anything serious .
Well , it turned out she had tuberculosis . ”
The woman was immediately masked and sent to the hospital to be quarantined until she was no longer contagious .
“ Here she had been getting on buses , on the subway , potentially infecting who knows how many New Yorkers , ” Dadarwala said , shaking his head .
“ If she had come in earlier , chances are we could ’ve done something before it developed into something so serious . ”
In other instances , of course , something serious happens with no warning , no prelude , just a sudden paralyzing jolt to the equilibrium .
Even the youngest , healthiest , most resilient bodies can malfunction in mysterious ways .
One morning you wake up with a minor stomachache , and before you know it , you ’re in the hospital , delirious with pain , waiting to see the doctor .

At the emergency room of Long Island College Hospital , Andrew Ondrejcak explained the nature of his stomach pain to an intern .
Notes were taken .
The intern vanished .
This happened three times in five hours .
At 7 a.m. , nearly seven hours after he arrived , Ondrejcak was given a CT scan .
“ Within fifteen minutes of getting the results back , I was on the operating table , opened up , ” he said .
“ Apparently , my appendix was about to rupture . ”
What took so long ?
Appendicitis is among the easiest conditions to diagnose : A CT scan will detect it 90 percent of the time , and appendectomies are among the most common surgeries performed .
But CT scans are expensive , and doctors , when dealing with the uninsured , are hyperconscious of burdening both patient and hospital with undue expenses .
According to a report by the Institute of Medicine , the uninsured are far more likely to receive inadequate care in hospitals : Conditions are improperly managed ; most bleakly , the uninsured are more likely to die in hospitals than the insured .
“ It ’s those catastrophe situations where insurance really proves invaluable , ” says the United Hospital Fund ’s James Tallon .
“ Without insurance , you ’re likely going to run into a roadblock at every stage of the process .
Will you get a referral ?
Will you get the right tests ?
What kind of care are you going to get ? ”
After Ondrejcak came out of surgery , his mother arrived from Mississippi and noticed something the nurses had somehow overlooked :
Her son was sweating profusely , yet his skin was cold to the touch , and a rash had broken out over most of his upper body .
“ My mom is typically this very sweet southern woman , but she was so pissed off , ” he recalled .
“ She asked if I was getting negligent care because I did n’t have insurance .
Later , the doctor made some remark about how the hospital is ‘ careful ’ with cases like mine because most people never pay . ”
It turned out that Ondrejcak was having an allergic reaction to the antibiotics , so he was taken off the medicine .
The rash subsided , but the healing process was jeopardized .
The following night he was discharged , only to find himself in serious pain again four days later — a condition the surgeon initially diagnosed as the result of an “ idle mind . ”
“ He said I ’d been sitting around all day , and that sometimes your mind can believe things are happening that are n’t really happening , ” remembered Ondrejcak .
“ I could n’t believe it . ”
When his test results came back , the doctor ’s tone was more urgent .
Ondrejcak ’s white - blood - cell count was three times normal , his pain likely connected to an internal infection and not at all imagined .
He was ordered to come to the hospital “ immediately , ” a term that has a different meaning to the uninsured .
Once again , Ondrejcak had to be admitted via the emergency room , wait a few hours , then explain to the ER physician that his doctor had sent him , wait while they paged the doctor , and again before being admitted .
He spent the next three days in the hospital , getting injections of intensive antibiotics every eight hours .
At last , he started to heal properly .
Three weeks later , the only evidence of the ordeal was a two - inch - long burgundy - colored scar below his right hipbone .
“ And then , ” said Ondrejcak , “ I got the bills . ”
They came separately , over the course of a week .
The most damaging expenses were for his overnight stays : $ 16,608.76 for his first , $ 16,223.61 for the second .
Then came the surgeon ’s bill ( $ 1,665.50 ) , the anesthesiologist ’s ( $ 1,014 ) , the two ER physicians ( $ 605 ) , the blood clinic ( $ 551 ) , and the post - op clinic ( $ 592.04 ) .
A staggering $ 37,259.91 in total , a sum far higher than the prenegotiated rates the hospital would have charged an insurer .
“ That ’s one of the unfortunate ironies , ” says Cunningham .
“ The same people who do n’t have insurance because they ca n’t afford it are charged much higher rates than someone with insurance . ”
Panicking , Ondrejcak called the hospital .
“ Look , I have no money , ” he told the woman from billing .
“ What am I supposed to do ? ”

Debt is a condition that can plague the uninsured long after they ’ve recovered from whatever brought it on in the first place .
Nearly half of all uninsured young adults have problems trying to pay off bills — taking second and third jobs , being hounded by collection agencies .
Some analysts have noted the oppressive effect this can have on the economy at large :
Debt pigeonholes the young into unwanted jobs , slowing down the overall job market .
“ The debt itself is devastating , ” says Commonwealth ’s Karen Davis .
“ Credit histories are ruined — it takes years , sometimes lifetimes , to come out from under it . ”
Giselle Reesey , a 20 - year - old aspiring musician who works at a Williamsburg coffee shop called Verb , is still reeling financially from what she described to me as “ a really , really bad year . ”
Last winter , she developed a rare blood infection that spread to her liver and kidneys and cost her $ 3,000 to treat .
At the same time , her husband , Ryan , who is 24 and waits tables at Suba , an upscale downtown restaurant , needed to have his tonsils removed .
The surgery cost close to $ 5,000 .
They set up an installment plan and are expected to pay about $ 60 a month , not always an easy sum to come up with .
“ A few months ago , we were living in this hellish pocket of Bushwick and our apartment was robbed , ” Reesey told me .
“ I literally went to the doctor ’s office and was like , ‘ Here , I was just robbed , all I have is this $ 12 .
I ’ll make it up next month . ’ ” Most frustrating about the debt , she said , is that the payments make it that much more unlikely that she and her husband will ever be able to afford insurance .
Debt is n’t simply a problem for the uninsured who incur it ; unpaid medical bills reverberate through the whole system .
“ It filters down to the rest of society , ” explains Cunningham .
“ Either the hospitals or the physicians absorb the cost , making the funding streams less certain and their capacity to deliver services more constrained .
And premiums for everyone else go up . ”
This point has become a favorite among those advocating a system overhaul .
“ We , in essence , have become the insurers of the uninsured , ” Victor Campbell , then - chairman of the Federation of American Hospitals , said last month when unveiling a proposal for universal coverage .
And in January , when Arnold Schwarzenegger announced that he would make insuring every Californian the cornerstone of his second term as governor , he sold the plan by stressing the “ hidden tax ” paid by the insured to offset the debt created by the uninsured .
As a stopgap measure to prevent the cycle of debt and higher costs from spiraling even more out of control , a handful of states have proposed raising the age under which children remain eligible to receive care under their parents ’ plans .
( In New Jersey , those as old as 30 now qualify . )
Massachusetts has gone the furthest , passing a landmark plan to make health insurance like car insurance : legally required and relatively affordable .
Yet for all the reform on a state level , analysts note that states do n’t have the revenue to sustain these programs for the long term .
As Cunningham puts it : “ Eventually , the federal government will have to step in and figure out a way to make it all work . ”
Facing nearly $ 40,000 in medical bills , Ondrejcak pleaded with the hospital .
The only thing he could do , they told him , was apply for Medicaid assistance .
He sorted through bank statements and pay stubs and submitted his claim :
His documented income for the month of the surgery came to $ 507 .
( He did n’t include tips or off - the - books work . )
A paltry sum , especially by New York standards .
And yet a few weeks later he received a letter from Medicaid denying his request .
The limit for assistance was an even paltrier $ 352.10 .
How was he expected to pay nearly $ 40,000 because he made $ 1,800 a year too much ?
File for an appeal , the hospital suggested .
On October 13 , 2004 , Ondrejcak presented his case at the Medicaid Assistance Program on West 34th Street .
“ It was all very cut - and - dry , ” he said .
“ Me , a woman representing Medicaid , and a judge - type guy .
She was like , ‘ I ’m sorry , there ’s nothing I can do , ’ and the other guy gives me a look like , ‘ Dude , you ’re fucked . ’
We all agreed in this itty - bitty room that there was nothing they could do to help me , but they all knew I was going to leave $ 40,000 in debt . ”
Notes from creditors began appearing in his mailbox , and Ondrejcak grew desperate .
“ Here ’s the deal , ” he told the hospital .
“ I ’m either going to file for bankruptcy , which will ruin my credit and ensure that you ’ll never get any money , or I ’m going to look into a malpractice lawsuit . ”
On March 20 , 2005 , almost exactly a year after the surgery , he received a letter stating that his hospital costs had been reduced — by 100 percent .
The other doctors followed suit , offering substantial discounts , and in the end , Ondrejcak had to pay only $ 1,700 .
It was an extraordinary conclusion for him , but a common one for hospitals .
When the sums are so high that a payment plan is n’t feasible , hospitals are often forced to simply write off the treatment as a loss .
New York hospitals alone provide $ 1.8 billion in uncompensated care annually .

It has been just over a year since Ondrejcak paid his last medical bill .
Now 27 , he no longer works at Sweet Melissa , having established himself as a freelance set designer for fashion shows .
He works in a studio near the Gowanus Canal that he shares with a client , the designers behind the trendy Vena Cava line .
A sun-speckled loft with wide - plank flooring , white - brick walls , and exposed air shafts , it ’s a space that epitomizes a kind of bohemian success : independent , informal , productive .
During one of our meetings , he was in the process of conceptualizing Alice Roi ’s Bryant Park show , one of a handful he was working on for Fashion Week , and had to excuse himself numerous times to give assistants direction or to answer calls from his agency .
His circumstances are vastly different from the morning he woke up in pain — on the surface , at least .
“ My credit is basically destroyed , ” he said .
“ It ’s amazing how much it haunts you .
The other day , I tried to apply for an extension on my credit limit and they rejected it , bringing all this up .
I ca n’t even imagine what will happen if I ever , like , try to buy a house . ”
Toward the end of one of our conversations , I asked Ondrejcak , the least invincible of young invincibles , how coming down with appendicitis changed his attitude toward health insurance .
Did he now see it as essential ?
Given what he had been through , and that he was better off financially , I assumed the answer was obvious .
I was wrong .
“ Oh , no , I still do n’t have any insurance , ” he told me , rolling his eyes to indicate that , yes , he knows how it sounds .
“ I think about it , but it ’s not like I have a consistent income right now .
I think about paying $ 300 a month on top of my other expenses , and it ’s like , God , when ’s it going to end ? ”
He paused .
“ But , really , it ’s more than that .
I was just so disillusioned with the process .
I wanted nothing to do with it , you know ?
And maybe because , in the end , I kind of managed to get away with it , I end up thinking … ”
He trailed off , not finishing the thought , but the sentiment was clear :
He is still young , he runs , he does yoga , he takes all the vitamins .
And it ’s not like you can get appendicitis twice .
No insurance ?
Here ’s where to go when …
You ’ve got a toothache :
The clinic at NYU ’s College of Dentistry provides care for 30 percent to 50 percent less than what you would pay out of pocket :
A checkup and cleaning is $ 50 to $ 90 , a filling is $ 70 to $ 110 .
You want drugs : Wal - Mart now offers 331 generic prescription drugs at the flat rate of $ 4 — everything from antidepressants to prenatal vitamins .
Worth buying a New Jersey Transit ticket to the big - box store in Secaucus .
You need birth control : Planned Parenthood is still the gold standard for inexpensive gynecological care .
Patients are charged on a sliding scale at the Brooklyn clinic :
An exam ranges from $ 39 to $ 116 , birth - control pills from $ 5 to $ 15 .
You have an emergency :
Go to a city - owned hospital ( for a list , go to nyc.gov / hhc ) , where , thanks to a sliding scale , single adults earning less than $ 38,280 pay $ 15 to $ 60 for ER services , and $ 5,000 max if they are hospitalized .
You decide you need insurance :
If you freelance twenty hours a week , call the Freelancers Union ( from $ 127 a month for catastrophic ) .
If you make less than $ 25,000 a year , try the state - run Healthy NY program ( from $ 145 a month ) .

Here ’s where to go when …
The reason there is a fight over Iraq funding is because Bush decided not to include such funding in the regular budget .
Why not ?
Who knows ?
Perhaps because his election - year budget presented fictional progress toward a " balanced budget " .
If he included his war funding in that budget , he could n't pretend a balanced budget was within reach .
( A trillion dollar war makes that difficult . )
But let 's not forget , the only reason this fight is being waged , is because Bush chose to underfund our troops in his regular budget .
And now he 's threatening to veto the funding Congress is allocating for the war .
In other words -- Bush refused to fund the troops in his budget , Congress is providing that funding , and Bush is threatening to veto that funding .
Nice way of doing business .
1988 : Thousands die in Halabja gas attack
Thousands of people are reported to have been killed and many others injured in a poison gas attack on a Kurdish city in northern Iraq .
Up to 20 aircraft , said to include Iraqi Migs and Mirages , were seen overhead at around 1100 local time in Halabja .
According to experts , the chemicals dropped by the planes may have included mustard gas , the nerve agents sarin , tabun and VX and possibly cyanide .
The attack on Halabja , which is about 150 miles ( 241 km ) north - east of the Iraqi capital Baghdad , is the latest in the Iran - Iraq war and follows its occupation by Iranian forces .
Iraq was said to be keen to avenge the fall of Halabja , which is seen as an important centre for Kurdish resistance in their struggle for autonomy .
The assault came after two days of conventional mortars , artillery and rockets from nearby mountains .
According to pro-Iranian Kurdish commanders in Halabja , there were up to 14 aircraft sorties , with seven to eight planes in each group .
The planes were believed to have concentrated their attacks on the city and all the roads leading out of it .
Eyewitnesses have told of clouds of smoke billowing upward " white , black and then yellow " ' , rising as a column about 150 feet ( 46 metres ) in the air .
Most of the wounded , who were taken to hospital in the Iranian capital Tehran , were suffering from mustard gas exposure .
Those who escaped death have developed respiratory or visual problems from the cocktail of chemicals dropped on the city .
According to some reports , up to 75 % of the victims were women and children .
The injured survivors seen by reporters showed the classic symptoms of mustard gas poisoning - ugly skin lesions and breathing difficulties .
Some residents survived by covering their faces with damp cloths and taking to the mountains around Halabja .
One resident , Abdul Rahman , 60 , an employee at the city 's mosque , said : " I do not know where my children are . "

Essence Magazine Inquires Regarding NAACP Request For Investigation ( Civil Rights ) Essence Magazine has inquired about the NAACP 's request for an investigation into two incidents regarding black public officials , one which resulted in death .
Apparently , Bruce Gordon , head of the NAACP , has personally appealed to the Attorney General to expedite investigations of these matters .
( Other members of the media have previously inquired about one incident or the other . )
Talking Points :
We are aware of the shooting death of Mayor - Elect Washington and the Department is receiving regular updates from the state police on the status of its investigation .
The FBI has initiated an investigation into the incident in which shots were fired into Mayor Lampkins ' home .
If the evidence in either or both incidents suggests a prosecutable violation of federal civil rights statutes , the Department will take appropriate action .
Media To Publish Stories On Former Assistant Attorney General Wooldridge ( ENRD ) Tomorrow , The New York Times and The Washington Post will run stories about Sue Ellen Wooldridge , former Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division , and her shared ownership of a S.C. property with a lobbyist for Conoco Phillips .
With regard to the purchase of the property in S.C. , Sue Ellen went through the proper channels in seeking advice from career ethics staff regarding the purchase of the property .
They informed her that the purchase did not raise ethical issues .
Sue Ellen regularly sought ethical advice from appropriate officials and recused herself from cases where appropriate and where she was advised to do so .
She was advised that she need not recuse herself from matters involving Conoco Phillips .
Conoco Phillips consent decrees were approved through the normal management channels and were presented to Sue Ellen with unanimous recommendations both from ENRD career staff and the staff at the Environmental Protection Agency .
Sue Ellen did not play a personal role in any of the settlement discussions , which were conducted by career attorneys .
Conoco Phillips has been a defendant in numerous cases in which the Department has reached settlements - some of which were approved by the EES chief in his capacity .
U.S. Government Seeks To Permanently Bar Alleged Fraudulent Tax Return Operation ( Tax ) The United States filed has filed suit seeking to permanently bar Richard E. Almy and his company , REA Associates , Inc. , from preparing federal tax returns , the Justice Department announced today .
According to the complaint , filed in the Middle District of Florida , Almy and his company prepared tax returns that claimed overstated , duplicated , and fabricated deductions on their clients ' tax returns .
An examination by the Internal Revenue Service of 175 tax returns prepared by Almy and his company during 2003 found that all of them required audit adjustments that increased the tax owed .
U.S. Army Translator Pleads Guilty To Unauthorized Possession Of Classified Documents Concerning Iraqi Insurgency ( USAO - Eastern District of New York ) A U.S. Army contract translator pleaded guilty today in federal court in Brooklyn to illegally possessing national defense documents .
The defendant , whose true name and identity remains unknown , was indicted on March 30 , 2006 , following an investigation by the FBI 's Joint Terrorism Task Force ( " JTTF " ) .
Previously , in November 2005 , the defendant was indicted for using a false identity to procure his United States citizenship and to gain access to classified military materials , and he pleaded guilty to those charges on Dec. 20 , 2005 .
When sentenced by United States District Judge Edward R. Korman , the defendant faces a maximum sentence of 60 years of imprisonment on his two convictions .
Talking Points : Safeguarding military plans and intelligence is vital to the security of our nation .
The defendant fraudulently obtained security clearances and then stole classified military information .
He will now be held to account for his crimes .

So I was awoken from my peak - oil slumber by this fairly extraordinary oped in the Washington Post .
It consists of a series of threats by Nawaf Obaid , a " an adviser to the Saudi government " , who is expressing opinions that are " his own and do not reflect official Saudi policy " , but nonetheless speaks in short clear declarative sentences about what the Saudi government will do if the US withdraws from Iraq .
Some choice grafs :
Just a few months ago it was unthinkable that President Bush would prematurely withdraw a significant number of American troops from Iraq .
But it seems possible today , and therefore the Saudi leadership is preparing to substantially revise its Iraq policy .
Options now include providing Sunni military leaders ( primarily ex-Baathist members of the former Iraqi officer corps , who make up the backbone of the insurgency ) with the same types of assistance -- funding , arms and logistical support -- that Iran has been giving to Shiite armed groups for years .
Another possibility includes the establishment of new Sunni brigades to combat the Iranian - backed militias .
Finally , Abdullah may decide to strangle Iranian funding of the militias through oil policy .
If Saudi Arabia boosted production and cut the price of oil in half , the kingdom could still finance its current spending .
But it would be devastating to Iran , which is facing economic difficulties even with today 's high prices .
The result would be to limit Tehran 's ability to continue funneling hundreds of millions each year to Shiite militias in Iraq and elsewhere .
So , is this last threat credible ?
Well , I updated my graph of Saudi oil production and rig count , added the IEA estimates to those of EIA and JODI .
The result is above , and detail showing the production slide this year more clearly is below .
How many rigs is Obaid proposing that the Saudis now rent , I wonder ?
So then we are left to judge whether this threat is more or less credible than the last :
To be sure , Saudi engagement in Iraq carries great risks -- it could spark a regional war .
So be it :
The consequences of inaction are far worse .
A shooting war between Saudi Arabia and Iran would certainly make for interesting times in the oil markets ...
( FWIW , my guess is that the US wo n't withdraw from Iraq in an orderly way soon .
The Bush administration does n't want to , and it's in the best political interests of Democrats to make a public show of calling for withdrawal while privately making sure not to do anything that would force the administration to change it 's politically disastrous course before the 2008 elections .
So the whole mess will probably continue to snowball a while longer -- until something so bad happens to American troops that public revulsion for the war becomes uncontainable . )

As traffic to chicagocrime.org has steadily increased , I 've been looking for ways to tweak the site 's performance .
The site runs on a rented dedicated server with Apache / mod_python , PostgreSQL and Django .
( I 'd love to bite the bullet and buy proper servers but have n't done so yet .
Donations are welcome ! )
One thing that 's always bugged me is that chicagocrime.org 's Apache instance serves both the dynamic , Django - powered pages and static media files such as the CSS and images .
It 's inefficient for a single Apache instance to act as both an application server ( mod_python ) and a media server .
A bunch of Apache configuration tweaks can improve performance of one aspect of serving but are somewhat detrimental to the other aspect .
For example , using the KeepAlive directive improves Apache 's media - serving capabilities , but KeepAlive is detrimental in a server arrangement that mainly churns out dynamic pages .
So if a single Apache instance does both media serving and dynamic page creation , you can't optimize for both cases .
( When I worked at LJWorld.com , we had the luxury of separate application , media and database servers , and we have a similar setup where I work now , but I can't afford separate servers for my little side projects . )
The solution hit me the other day -- I can just use Amazon 's new Amazon S3 data - storage service to host chicagocrime .org 's media files , so my own Apache server can focus on serving dynamic pages .
S3 is very cheap -- 15 cents a month for each gig of storage ( and I have only 936 K of media files ) and 20 cents per gig bandwidth .
That 's peanuts .
It was easy to get this working ; took less than an hour total .
Here 's what I did :
First , I signed up for an Amazon S3 account .
Do that by clicking " Sign Up For Web Service " on the main S3 page .
When you sign up , you get two codes : an access key ID and secret access key .
Next , I created an S3 " bucket " for my chicagocrime.org media files .
An account can have multiple buckets .
As far as I can tell , it 's just a way of keeping your S3 stuff in separate containers .
I did this by using the free S3 Python bindings .
Just download the file , unzip it and put the file S3. py somewhere on your Python path .
To create a bucket named ' mybucketname ' , do this : import S3 conn = S3.AWSAuthConnection ( ' your access key ' , ' your secret key ' ) conn.create_bucket('mybucketname ' )
Next , I wrote a Python script that uploaded my media files to this bucket and made them publically readable .
S3 has a bunch of complex authentication stuff , but all I wanted to do was use S3 , essentially , as a Web hosting service .
Here 's the script I used , and here 's how to use it : $ cd / directory / with / media / files / find | python / path/to/update_s3.py
The script is kind of cool because it uses Python 's mimetypes to determine the content type of each file in order to pass that to the S3 API .
Otherwise it 's pretty straightforward .
Finally , it was just a matter of changing my chicagocrime.org templates to point to S3's URLs rather than my own URLs .
That was a snap , thanks to Django 's template inheritance and includes .
Now chicagocrime.org 's media files are served directly off of S3 , at a cost of 35 cents a month , and my Apache is happier .
Are you a cigarette smoker ?
Are you thinking about making the switch over to vaping from cigarette smoking ?
If you are still on the fence about whether or not you should try out 120 ml vape juice from eliquid depot , you should know that there are several great reasons for why you should make the switch right now .
You would find that a lot of people would also tell you to start vaping ejuice rather than smoking .
This is because they also know that there are numerous reasons for why smoking is bad for you .
And with those many reasons for why smoking is harmful to your body , there are just as many reasons to being vaping .
Say goodbye to nicotine stains
One of the worst things about smoking is that you would get nicotine stains .
Cigarette smoking can actually cause the tips of your fingers and even your teeth to become discolored , from the smoke that you inhale in your mouth .
You would not get the same problem if you decided to start vaping .
You can kiss those potential nicotine stains goodbye when you use vaporizers .
This is because there would be less danger of you getting nicotine stains if you start to vape instead of smoke .
Easier on your wallet
The overall cost of vaping is also much lower than that of cigarette smoking .
This is mainly due to the fact that you can get more uses out of a single bottle of vape juice compared to one single box of cigarettes .
If you calculate the costs of the amount of nicotine and uses that you can get out of a bottle of vape juice , you would see that it is much cheaper to vape than to buy a box of cigarettes .
Not to mention that you can save a lot on medical bills for the future as well since vape is healthier for your body .
Better for your body
Many medical studies have actually been done on vaping .
And all of them have found out that vaping e-liquid is much better for your body .
There are a lot of health risks that are associated with cigarette smoking , such as an increase in the development of lung and throat cancer .
You could avoid all of those health risks if you just used vaporizers and electronic cigarettes instead .
The vapor from an electronic cigarette is not going to harm your lungs or body in any way at all .
Those are just some of the reasons to switch over to vaping ejuice instead of smoking traditional burning cigarettes .
If you ask around , more people would actually tell you to vape electronic cigarettes instead of smoking them .
In general , the effects to your health are also going to be better if you start vaping .
Your throat would not be as dry if you vape e-liquids .
Cigarette smoking can actually burn or destroy your throat , not to mention also this can cause throat cancer as well .
So with all of these good reasons for vaping , there are very few that should stop you from starting to try out electronic cigarettes .
I read with interest and amusement , once again , that the military is warning that Iran will have nuclear weapons in as little as five years .
Let ’s ignore that there is no evidence that Iran is seeking a nuclear weapons program , that they really have little substantial to gain from such a program , and that we can be almost totally certain that even if they have nukes , they will never use them .
I want to focus on something else , one of the earliest political / foreign policy memories I have .
I think I might have been 7 , or 8 , or 9ish … and I distinctly recall my dread at the idea that Iran — of course run by insane psychos who only want to kill Americans for the sheer fun of it — would have nuclear weapons in as little as five years .
I ca n’t come up with anything online ( maybe a better googler can ) , and I do n’t know where I heard it or who it was that said it , but I remember dwelling on it for a while .
If you think kids do n’t pay attention , if you think they are n’t affected emotionally and possibly developmentally by the constant braying about the relatively minor threat of terrorism and the “ threat ” from various and sundry enemies overseas , think again .
Anyway my point is :
It ’s been around 20 years .
Where the hell are those nukes ?
They ’re just now going through the first stages of refining uranium .
And once again , not for the first or even second time , we ’re being shrieked at about the nuclear threat from Iran .
Some Americans
I have had contact with actually think that Iran is RIGHT NOW building nuclear weapons .
The propaganda is working on some .
But why should we believe them now ?
UPDATE : Thanks to Paul who sent this link , another five - year prediction from 1995 [ pdf ] .
Since 1994 , I 've been involved in developing virtual communities .
Now that they are all the rage , I 've taken the time to start sharing my related thoughts .
With a little luck , someone might find some valuable information in my rambling .
I 'm no fan of the classic login / password scheme .
I can barely remember any of the zillion logins and passwords I have .
More often than not , I end up using the " forgot password " link .
Which means , in effect , that my email account is my global password .
And if you 're like most people , your email password is n't very secure .
As Bruce Schneier recently observed :
We used to quip that " password " is the most common password .
Now it 's " password1 . "
Who said users have n't learned anything about security ?
It 's a depressing state of affairs .
Switching to passphrases helps , but is a band - aid at best .
The relentless increase in phishing attacks may soon force some changes on this front .
I saw in the news that PayPal is switching to two - factor authentication .
Specifically , they 're providing users with a keyfob that produces a new six - digit code every 30 seconds .
Users will now have to type in their name , password , and a valid code from the keyfob .
The PayPal system is n't SecurID , but I 'm sure the implementation is very similar .
There 's a matching seed value stored on the server for each keyfob , so the server can calculate what the correct code should be .
If the user enters the correct password and the correct code ( within 30 seconds ) , they 're allowed in .
So what 's the value in doing this ?
It 's more hassle and more expense .
Well , consider that all security is based on three things :
What you have
What you know
What you are
We all use logins and passwords .
That 's something we know .
When we enter the code from the keyfob , we 've added something we have to the mix .
That 's two factor authentication , and it increases security dramatically .
But even with the keyfob , we have n't quite removed the risk of phishing entirely .
All we 've done is make the window of opportunity smaller .
If a phishing site can relay the user - provided data to the server in real time ( or close enough ) , they will still be authenticated .
A common form of local two - factor authentication is the Smart Card .
Smart cards have an embedded microprocessor that uniquely identifies each card , a private key of sorts .
Some even have the ability to store data .
The secrets on each card stay secret because it 's impossible to extract the data without destroying the chip in the process .
Since smart cards are read by hardware on your PC , they 're of no use online .
But they can dramatically enhance security locally .
For example , Windows has embedded support for smart cards ; it 's possible to log into the operating system using nothing but a smart card and a short PIN code .
The PIN code is still a password of sorts , but it 's much shorter and easier to remember .
Once you switch over to smart cards , it 's no longer possible to log in using a traditional username and password .
Your underlying password becomes a randomly generated 64 - character string .
As you can imagine , this is a huge boon for local security compared to user - selected passwords .
I do n't personally care for smart cards , but I can certainly understand why organizations choose to use them .
But two - factor authentication , although more secure , is n't a panacea .
Bruce Schneier is quick to remind us that two - factor authentication is vulnerable to two primary forms of attack :
Man - in - the - Middle attack .
An attacker puts up a fake bank website and entices user to that website .
User types in his password , and the attacker in turn uses it to access the bank 's real website .
Done right , the user will never realize that he is n't at the bank 's website .
Then the attacker either disconnects the user and makes any fraudulent transactions he wants , or passes along the user 's banking transactions while making his own transactions at the same time .
Trojan attack .
Attacker gets Trojan installed on user 's computer .
When user logs into his bank 's website , the attacker piggybacks on that session via the Trojan to make any fraudulent transaction he wants .
We already knew about the man - in - the - middle attack ; we refer to it as real - time phishing .
As for trojans , it might be a little unfair to blame two - factor authentication for not protecting the user from a compromised system .
I 'm not sure any security measures can work on a compromised system with trojan keyloggers and screenloggers installed .
Despite Schneier 's skepticism , I think two - factor authentication is worthwhile .
Anything that moves the security bar beyond the hopelessly insecure and ineffective username / password combos we 're currently stuck with is a welcome change .
FEELING depressed because you missed out on Google 's stock bonanza ?
Not to worry .
Just get on the company 's shadow payroll .
Hundreds of thousands of people have essentially done just that by starting blogs , forums or other informational sites and getting paid for posting ads on Google 's behalf .
And while the money they earn might not be enough for them to buy , say , a share of Google 's stock , such revenues are growing .
The trickle - down effect from Google does not stop at fledgling entrepreneurs .
A growing number of rank - and - file contributors to Web sites are also profiting .
Consider Digital Point Solutions , a software company in San Diego , which publishes an online forum ( http://forums.digitalpoint.com) frequented by about 15,000 users .
Any one of them who starts a new forum discussion topic receives half of the advertising revenue paid to the site by Google for ads on the front page of that topic section .
( The discussion 's creator then splits his share with others who post messages . )
Google does not actually advertise on the Digital Point site .
Rather , through Google 's AdSense program , it places ads on the forum , similar to the ads that appear next to search results on Google.com .
Google scans the information on the forum 's pages , then posts related ads .
If the discussion is about computer hardware , for instance , ads for DVD drives might appear .

For a woman who claims her life is ' mundane ' , JK Rowling likes a luxury holiday .
In the past few years she has cruised the Galapagos at a cost of around £ 15,000 , blown £ 14,000 on a holiday in Mauritius and enjoyed the comforts of a £ 6,000 - aweek hotel in the Seychelles .
Her latest outing , however , tops the lot .
For , after a charitable engagement in New York , she and her family have decamped to the Hamptons , that millionaire 's playground on the East Coast , to stay in an imposing seven - bedroom beachfront house .
The cost - £ 76,000 a week .
Jo Rowling can , of course , afford it - and then some .
Her fortune is somewhere between £ 500 million and £ 600 million and , when the seventh and final instalment of Harry Potter is published next year , will receive another significant boost .
More money generated by the movies , merchandising and royalties from the books will continue to roll in for the rest of her life .
Indeed , the scale of her wealth is such that it is hard to comprehend .
It has been said she is richer than the Queen .
She earns around £ 1 million every three days .
It is the kind of fortune it would be impossible to spend even if she stayed in that luxury pad in the Hamptons all year round .
Her life now is , naturally , very different from the hand - to - mouth struggle of the days before Potter was published .
Back then , she famously nursed cold coffees in an Edinburgh cafe for hours as she wrote , her daughter Jessica sleeping in a buggy beside her .
She subsisted on £ 70 a week benefits , and her flat was infested with mice .
Now , she has a property portfolio ( Edinburgh , Perthshire and Kensington ) , flies by private jet and dresses herself in Vivienne Westwood for special occasions .
And yet the story of what Jo Rowling spends her money on is far from a predictable tale of conspicuous consumption .
Indeed , it is a story which provides a valuable and uplifting counterpoint to the circus of pointless and continuous spending indulged in by other modern celebrities like , say , Victoria Beckham .
Having found fame and fortune late in life , she has not been tempted into any fashion excesses .
Indeed , she has never been particularly interested in style , and often describes her younger self as a ' freckled beach ball ' .
She is appalled by the excesses of modern celebrity culture and particularly disturbed by the cult of thin -ness .
That said , she does like a nice handbag , and glamorous shoes - Jimmy Choo , Prada , or even Dior .
When she won a literary award earlier this year , she told the audience : ' My first award was a Nibbie , but that night I was wearing much , much cheaper shoes . '
But as she told an interviewer recently : ' I 've got a mental amount I can't spend beyond .
I limit myself to what I think I would be justified in spending on frivolity . '
The amount , it seems , is around £ 500 .
For although her life is comfortable and she allows herself some ' treats ' , in truth Jo Rowling lives not much better than the wife of say , an averagely successful City banker .
She does not have , a la Posh , a dozen diamond - encrusted watches - actually she barely ever wears one and the most expensive in her collection is a fairly simple £ 300 number from Gucci .
She would be quite horrified by the idea of buying , as Victoria has done , an expensive designer watch worth several thousand pounds for one of her three children ( Jessica , from her first marriage , is 11 , David is three and Mackenzie , her baby daughter , one ) .
Luxury cars
Nor does this woman , who is among the wealthiest in the world , allow herself the decadent pleasure of one of the new generation of luxury cars .
Sources in Edinburgh indicate that she does n't even have a Chelsea tractor .
She prefers something anonymous , as does her husband Neil Murray .
( Murray , for goodness ' sake , continues to work as a GP and , in her own words , ' does n't really spend money ' . )
At times over the past nine years she has seemed to be in open rebellion against her wealth .
She , for instance , insisted on delivering both her children in her local NHS hospital , and her offspring are educated at local state schools .
It 's not that she was born poor : her childhood was comfortable , and her father is a retired Rolls - Royce engineer .
But she does have that formative experience of poverty as a young adult after the break - up of her first marriage , and this seems to have combined with a sense of social justice to make her a very uneasy multi-millionaire .
For , it emerges , her wealth has made her uncomfortable to the point of soul - searching , if not actual anguish .
And although she is now far more sanguine about the ' ludicrous ' amount of money which she earns , she still seems to believe , deep down , that she does not really deserve to be so utterly , stinking rich .
And so she has quietly but steadily been engaged in giving away great chunks of her money .
She gave £ 22 million to Comic Relief , for instance .
Charity
She has just set up a charity , the Children 's High Level Group , to promote children 's rights , particularly disabled children in care homes in Eastern Europe .
She is the global ambassador for the National Council for One - Parent Families , and patron of Maggie 's Centres for cancer sufferers and the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Scotland .
Her bounty extends to smaller matters , too : she has funded the making of a short film about domestic abuse , and recently donated a signed copy of Harry Potter that was sold to help improve facilities at a local GP 's surgery .
For Jo Rowling , an intelligent graduate who worked for Amnesty International after university , has never lost her social conscience .
She has told interviewers that she has spent years being ' a few steps behind ' her burgeoning fame and fortune , feeling caught out and overwhelmed by it .
She said : ' It just seems , well , this came to me through doing the thing I love doing most .
I suppose I feel I have n't suffered enough . '
Of late , she has settled into her super - rich status , becoming more at ease with all of the nice things she can now have - hence perhaps the stay in the Hamptons .
' I'm certainly not going to complain about the money , ' she said earlier this year .
' If you 've literally been worrying " Will the money last until the end of the week ? " you will never , ever complain about having the money . '
So what , then does she spend it on - apart from travelling and helping people ?
A major expense is her staff .
She employs two secretaries , to deal with the 1,000 or so letters she receives a week .
She also has a very effective PA , who works full time co-ordinating her diary and her engagements .
More expensively , she is said also to pay the wages of a full - time , ex-SAS bodyguard , who gives close protection to her and her family at a cost of £ 150,000 a year .
Her ' day - to - day ' house in Edinburgh has electric gates , high fences and a sophisticated CCTV system to deter intruders .
That makes it sound obtrusive , but the house is not ostentatious .
The home is actually two houses knocked into one - a 13 - bedroom pile worth around £ 2 million .
Described as homely and sometimes chaotic inside , it is decorated in strong colours and the ethnic patterns that she has always loved .
She lives simply .
Her office is the size of a single bedroom .
She writes in the morning , makes herself a sandwich and then writes again until it is time for Jessica to return from school .
Some weekends she spends with Neil and the children at their country home in Perthshire .
This property , on the banks of the River Tay , is beautiful but not particularly grand , with six bedrooms .
The final property in her portfolio is a home in Kensington , West London , worth £ 4.5 million .
It seems more of an investment than a home .
' The point about Jo , ' says a friend , 'is that she does n't want to be flashy or ostentatious , ever .
She wants to be left alone to have a normal family life . '
It seems the legacy she wants Harry Potter to leave is a charitable one : of giving and helping children in desperate need .
Her own family , she hopes , will turn out to be simply normal .
One does wonder if Brooklyn , Romeo and Cruz Beckham were to meet Jessica , David and Mackenzie in 20 years ' time , what they would make of each other , and of their own , very different , childhoods .

Crab Nebula : 6,500 light - years away in the constellation of Taurus
Neutron stars are the dense remnants of massive stars that have met their demise in supernova explosions .
Some are called pulsars , because they emit lighthouse - like beams of radio waves that sweep across the Earth .
The profiles of this star 's pulses suggest the magnetic field that drives its emissions is highly unusual .
If the findings were confirmed , the neutron star would be the first cosmic object found to have four poles , said Tim Hankins , from the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and lead investigator on the study .
Megapulse
Ordinarily in a two - pole spinning neutron star , depending on the line of view from Earth , either one or two pulses will be detected .
And the Crab Nebula pulsar is one of those for which two pulses can be identified .
One of these beams is called the main pulse .
Occasionally , this produces enormously strong pulses called " megapulses " .
The other beam is called the interpulse .
The profiles of pulses from the north and south poles of a neutron star should be identical , said Professor Hankins .
Instead , the team found that the two pulses were dramatically different in their profiles , the first time this has been seen in a pulsar .
" We think we 've got a much more complicated magnetic field than the simple dipole model , " he added .
" What we think is that there is another pole , possibly with a partner , that is influencing and distorting the magnetic field , " the Arecibo Observatory astronomer said .
Frozen pole
Magnetic poles always come in pairs , so the fourth is a distinct likelihood .
This neutron star was born in a supernova explosion that was observed on Earth on 4 July , AD 1054 .
Professor Hankins said the magnetic poles were essentially " frozen " into the remnant after the supernova explosion .
The cosmic explosion may have been very asymmetric : " Any models you see of supernova explosions are incredibly convoluted .
It just does n't go down as sphere and rebound as a nice sphere .
" The magnetic pole is frozen in so it gets all mixed up as well . "

Home A Very Modal Model of a Modern , Major , General Type System A Very Modal Model of a Modern , Major , General Type System , by Andrew W. Appel , Paul - Andre Mellies , Christopher D. Richards , and Jerome Vouillon .
Preliminary version of August 10 , 2006 .
We wish to compile languages such as ML and Java into typed intermediate languages and typed assembly languages .
These TILs and TALs are particularly difficult to design , because in order to describe the program transformations applied in the course of compilation , they require a very rich and expressive type system ...
Putting all these type ingredients together in a low - level language is an intricate exercise .
A formal proof of soundness Â — any well - typed program does not go wrongÂ — is thus recommended for any type system for such TILs and TALs .
It has been awhile since we discussed work in this area .
The current paper is quite intriacte , it seems , and I do n't have the time to read it carefully .
Maybe someone else would care to elaborate .
The paper makes a few technical innovations , and uses several interesting techniques .
Soundness is not proved syntactically , but rather semantically .
Some LtU member will be happy to see that the authors use Coq to formalize their proofs .

WASHINGTON , July 25 — Legislation drafted by the Bush administration setting out new rules on bringing terror detainees to trial would allow hearsay evidence to be introduced unless it was deemed “ unreliable ” and would permit defendants to be excluded from their own trials if necessary to protect national security , according to a copy of the proposal .
The bill , which officials said was being circulated within the administration , is not final , but it indicates the direction of the administration ’s approach for dealing with a Supreme Court decision that struck down the tribunals established to try terror suspects at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba .
The 32 - page bill preserves the idea of using military commissions to prosecute terror suspects and makes modest changes in their procedural rules , including several expanded protections for defendants , many of them drawn from the military ’s legal code .
But the proposal also sets up a possible confrontation with lawmakers who have called for modeling the trials on the military ’s rules for courts - martial , which would allow defendants more rights .
The draft measure describes court - martial procedure as “ not practicable in trying enemy combatants ” because doing so would “ require the government to share classified information ” and would exclude “ hearsay evidence determined to be probative and reliable . ”
So you ’ve seen the Pleo , Flamosapien , and other robots , but can they transform ?
The “ Mighty Morphin Rayered - X ” sure can .. and lots more as well .
Mighty Morphin Rayered -X
Rayered - X ( pronounced Layered - X ) is an innovative robot with four extremeties – each consisting of seven servos – that give it 28 degrees of freedom .
It sports a custom aluminum frame , is 50 cm tall and weighs around 8 pounds .
Unfortunately , it only placed 24th during the “ Demonstration ” phase of the Robo - One competition .
“ At first it looks like a short tower , then becomes a carousel , then a walking spider , then into a tall biped battle robot .
It can even transform an arm into a new leg and keep on fighting . ”

King Kizer
Rayered - X and OmniZero. 2 were n’t the only cool robots at Robo - One 9 .
Add King Kizer to the list , this bot can track and hit opponents with great accuracy — along with jumping rope .
Knife Blade Robot
This interesting robot — from Robo - One 9 — is equipped with two knife blades .
Unfortunately , it ’s not battling against a comparable bot — what a match it would ’ve been .
“ Still , it ’s not that unusual to find a Robo - One robot equipped with a couple of knife blades that scaled up to life size would be close to samurai sword length . ”

Microsoft Windows Kill Switch
Does Microsoft have the ability to disable Windows remotely ?
Maybe :
Two weeks ago , I wrote about my serious objections to Microsoft ’s latest salvo in the war against unauthorized copies of Windows .
Two Windows Genuine Advantage components are being pushed onto users ’ machines with insufficient notification and inadequate quality control , and the result is a big mess .
( For details , see Microsoft presses the Stupid button . )
Guess what ?
WGA might be on the verge of getting even messier .
In fact , one report claims WGA is about to become a Windows “ kill switch ” ­ and when I asked Microsoft for an on - the - record response , they refused to deny it .
And this , supposedly from someone at Microsoft Support :
He told me that “ in the fall , having the latest WGA will become mandatory and if its not installed , Windows will give a 30 day warning and when the 30 days is up and WGA is n’t installed , Windows will stop working , so you might as well install WGA now . ”
The stupidity of this idea is amazing .
Not just the inevitability of false positives , but the potential for a hacker to co-opt the controls .
I hope this rumor ends up not being true .
Although if they actually do it , the backlash could do more for non-Windows OSs than anything those OSs could do for themselves .

The bank has helped a large number of women to set up small businesses
Enlarge Image
She is one of the thousands of women in the drought - prone Mann Desh region of Satara district in the western Indian state of Maharashtra whose lives have been transformed by the 10 - year - old Mann Deshi Mahila Sahakari Bank ( MDMSB ) , a unique cooperative bank run by and for women .
" Our mission is to empower women in poverty - stricken areas so that they achieve financial independence and self - sufficiency , " says founder - president Chetna Gala Sinha .
Mrs Sinha herself hails from a well - to - do business family in Mumbai ( Bombay ) .
A post - graduate in economics , she left city life and settled down in Mhaswad , a village in Satara district , after marrying Vijay Sinha , an activist and a farmer .
Daily loans
The Mhaswad - based nine - year - old bank operates across five districts .
A unique aspect of this fully computerised bank is that it offers weekly and fortnightly credit and savings schemes to its customers , most of whom are daily or weekly wage earners .
Unlike any other bank , it also provides daily loans for buying vegetables or fruits .
With 48,000 members and assets worth 90,000,000 rupees ( $ 2 m ) , the bank enjoys a repayment rate of 97.5 % .
The bank has created 16,720 women entrepreneurs in the region around Mhaswad .
The clientele consists of poor women with annual incomes averaging 22,000 rupees ( $ 490 ) .
We have observed that when women control household finances , more money is spent on children , education , health care , and other important domestic requirements
Chetna Gala Sinha
Another is Sakubai Lokhande , a backward caste woman and a grandmother of 11 , who does not know her real age .
What matters most to her is that even at this age , she earns $ 180 a month by making and selling brooms and ropes .
She has built houses for her two children and is financing the education of her grandchildren .
Or polio - stricken Shobha Raut , who her own grocery store and supports her parents .
MDMSB is the first bank in the country to have more than 6,700 members from the backward castes .
Property rights
" We also have male depositors , but we provide finances only through women , " says Mrs Sinha .
" We have observed that when women control household finances , more money is spent on children , education , health care , and other important domestic requirements . "
Now the bank has launched a business school that will provide technical , financial and marketing training and guidance to girl school dropouts and women with no formal education to start and improve their own small enterprises .
The bank has also established kiosk centres to enable farmers to plan and manage farming activities and market their products with optimal returns .
To stop men from driving their wives out of the house or selling off the property at their whim , Mrs Sinha has implemented a novel idea .
Polio - stricken Shobha
Raut runs her own grocery store
The bank has helped as many as 600,000 women to get a share in the property .
In 2004 , it also convinced the authorities to include women 's names on property papers in recognition of a woman 's right to household property .
Women can now use these papers in the court of law to prevent their husbands from selling or divesting household property .
The bank has also created an incentive for women to become homeowners by giving them a 1 % rebate on interest paid on loans .
To encourage girls ' education , the bank provides low - interest loans and scholarships for girls and has instituted insurance and pension programmes for women .
" Our bank demonstrates the effectiveness of microfinance as a financial tool to reach out to the poorest of the poor .
We would like to expand our activities to encompass migrant workers and street vendors in urban areas , " informs Mrs Sinha .
" We have shown that banking with the poor is n't always a loss - making proposition , " she adds .
" Each success story has inspired more innovation and creativity . "
Irrespective of its causes , however , this drop comes at a critical time , with demand for pollination services rocketing upward .
Even in a high - tech age when the human capacity to improve upon nature seems limitless , there is no satisfactory substitute for the honeybee .
Thus it ’s astonishing that beekeeping remains largely unimproved by technological advances relative to just about every other form of animal husbandry .
The basic design of honey bee housing is essentially unchanged since L. L. Langstroth patented his movable frame hive in 1852 ; artificial insemination of queens , the last significant technological advance in beekeeping , was introduced early in the 20th century .
The 21st century holds great promise for innovation .

Last October , an international consortium of scientists announced the publication of the sequence of the entire honey bee genome .
Among the benefits of knowing the full gene inventory is that it has allowed the construction of a whole - genome microarray — essentially a microscope slide dotted with genetic material — here at the University of Illinois .
Microarray analysis is a powerful tool for examining differences among a very large number of genes rapidly and efficiently ; it ’s the basis for new diagnostic tools , for example , for clinical evaluation of many forms of cancer .
For bees , microarray analysis of differences between healthy and afflicted bees may reveal the causes and provide insights for developing a cure .
The real key to dealing with colony collapse disorder , however , is understanding the extent of the problem , which may prove to be more of a challenge than figuring out its origins .
Although Americans are in general good at counting things of value , we ’ve done an absolutely appalling job at counting our bees and other pollinators .
In October , I served as chair of a committee for the National Research Council , the research arm of the National Academy of Sciences , on the status of pollinators in North America .
Among the clearest conclusions of our report was that Americans do not keep track of pollinators , even the one on which much of our agriculture depends .
For example , the Department of Agriculture ’s statistics service has kept records of honeybee colonies managed by beekeepers since 1947 , but the annual survey monitors only colonies used in honey production .
Colonies used exclusively for pollination are not included , nor do surveys take into account the fact that some honey - producing colonies travel .
The Agriculture Department also does n’t track bees kept by small - scale beekeepers with fewer than five colonies .
No current survey monitors colony health or variability in bee numbers over the season , a critical variable for assessing population dynamics as well as economic effects of fluctuations .
Although the Agriculture Department surveys beekeeping operations every five years using criteria that address some of these issues , five years between surveys provides ample time for irreparable damage to occur before a problem can be recognized .
Card was delivered with this sketch on the envelope instead of an address
Paul Bates sent a Christmas card to a long - lost pal in this envelope with NO street name , NO town , NO postcode — yet it arrived !
Steel worker , 48 , had forgotten the name of the town workmate Peter O’Leary moved to from Neath , South Wales , three years ago .
But he recalled Peter had pointed it out on a map .
So he put a dot on a sketch of the South West Peninsula , wrote “ somewhere here ” and hoped for the best .
Amazingly the card arrived at Peter ’s home in Bude , North Cornwall , nine days later — after his postman recognized the name in a local sorting office .
The pals are now back in contact and plan to meet soon .
Peter , 48 , now a driving instructor , said : “ It was very inventive . ”
Hugh MacLeod asks , if open source is so great , where are all the open source billionaires ?
If Open Source software is free , then why bother spending money on Microsoft Partner stuff ?
I already know what Microsoft 's detractors will say : " There 's no reason whatsoever .
$ 40 billion per year is totally wasted . "
This , however is not a very satisfying answer , simply because it does n't quite ring true .
Otherwise there 'd be a lot more famous Open Source billionaires out there , being written up in Forbes Magazine or wherever .
And Bill Gates would 've been ousted years ago .
I can immediately think of one reason there are n't any open - source billionaires :
Most competition for open source software comes from other open source software .
It 's far more cutthroat than the commercial software market could ever be .
Rajesh Setty responded to Hugh 's question with a few additional reasons why it 's difficult for open source businesses to make money :
If open source is license free , the costs have to be low to work with open source .
If cost is one of the reasons for a customer to embrace open source , he or she will pay less than what they would have paid to a comparable enterprise software to do the same job .
An open source company would have to therefore work twice as hard to a comparable enterprise software company to make the same or less amount of money .
This means that they have to have a lot more resources than the competing enterprise software company .
How can you have a smaller pie but feed a lot more people and still keep everyone happy ?
But I think MacLeod is asking the wrong question , so Setty 's answers , although well reasoned , are irrelevant .
There probably wo n't ever be any open source billionaires .
Just ask JBoss founder Marc Fleury :
To do [ open source software ] seriously , professionally , in a sustainable fashion you need to make a living .
What is clearly compromised is the " instant billionaire " club .
I remember the first time I saw Torvalds on a panel and someone asked " why is n't there an open source billionaire " , and I immediately thought " because you are distributing FREE SOFTWARE , dummy . "
And there still is n't an open source billionaire today .
There are very few billionaires period .
Your average MSFT developer certainly is n't one .
I for one do n't believe there will ever be an open source billionaires club .
There are and will be many multi-millionaires though .
If we execute on our plan without screwing up , we will create a large batch of OS millionaires .
We care about the developers and people who create real value in companies getting rewarded .
The lack of open source software billionaires is by design .
It 's part of the intent of open source software -- to balance the scales by devaluing the obscene profit margins that exist in the commercial software business .
Duplicating software is about as close to legally printing money as a company can get ; profit margins regularly exceed 80 percent .
To ask where the open source billionaires are is to demonstrate a profound misunderstanding of how open source software works .
If you wanted to become obscenely rich by starting an open source software company , I 'm sorry , but you picked the wrong industry .
You 'll make a living , perhaps even a lucrative one .
But you wo n't become Bill Gates rich , or Paul Allen rich , by siphoning away the exorbitant profit margins commercial software vendors have enjoyed for so many years .
But there is a silver lining .
There are real millionaires – even billionaires – who built companies on open source software .
Just ask Larry Page and Sergey Brin .
Or the YouTube founders .
The real money is n't in the software .
It 's in the service you build with that software .
Peak Oil Saudi Oil Production Down 8 percent By Ryan McGreal
Published March 02 , 2007
Almost a year ago , on a tip from Richard Gilbert , RTH picked up on a mostly - ignored report in Platts Oilgram News that Saudi Arabia was past its oil production peak .
Today , over at The Oil Drum , Stuart Staniford reports that Saudi Arabian oil production dropped eight percent last year .
Saudi Oil production , Jan 2006 - Jan 2007 ( Source : The Oil Drum )
Some commentators - including most peak oil deniers - are arguing that OPEC 's oil production dropped last year because they want to maintain high prices .
However , this flies in the face of OPEC 's longstanding policy , which is to keep oil trading in the $ 20 - 35 dollar range - high enough to be profitable , low enough to price non-conventional oil out of the market , and moderate enough to encourage steady consumption growth of around two percent a year .
We learned reecently that oil production has been stalled at 84 million barrels a day for the past two years , and many buyers , especially in less developed countries , are simply being priced out of the market as sustained high prices destroy market demand .
We are certainly being lied to about Saudi Arabia 's oil reserves - and the reserves of every other OPEC country as well .
In the 1980s , when OPEC changed its rules so that countries could only export oil based on their reserves , every country 's reserve estimates jumped .
In January 2006 , a leaked internal memo found that Kuwait 's oil reserves were only around 50 billion barrels instead of the 100 billion the Kuwaiti Oil Company had been claiming .
Similarly , we are being lied to about Saudi Arabia 's continued ability to crank out millions of barrels a day .
Saudi Aramco has been pumping seven million barrels of saltwater a day into its massive Ghawar field just to keep production flat , and the water cut is a significant , and growing , share of the total output .

President George W Bush views the plan to cut British forces to about 5,000 by the end of the summer as " a sign of success " , according to a US National Security Council spokesman , Gordon Johndroe .
Mr Bush spoke to the prime minister about the plans by video link yesterday , Mr Johndroe said .
" While the United Kingdom is maintaining a robust force in southern Iraq , we 're pleased that conditions in Basra have improved sufficiently that they are able to transition more control to the Iraqis , " he said .
Vice president Dick Cheney , on a visit to Japan , endorsed that view .
" I look at it and what I see is an affirmation of the fact that in parts of Iraq ... things are going pretty well , " he told ABC News .
Mr Cheney said a friend who had just travelled from Baghdad to Basra , where most British troops are based , " found the situation dramatically improved compared to where it was a year or so ago " .
However Mr Cheney said Washington remained committed to its own plan to send another 21,500 troops to Iraq to try to stop violence in Baghdad and other areas .
He condemned opposition to the US plan by Nancy Pelosi , the speaker of the US House of Representatives , and Representative John Murtha , both Democrats .
" I think in fact if we were to do what Speaker Pelosi and Congressman Murtha are suggesting , all we 'll do is validate the al - Qaida strategy , " Mr Cheney said .
" The al - Qaida strategy is to break the will of the American people . "
The US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , said " the coalition remains intact " , despite Britain 's move .
" The British have done what is really the plan for the country as a whole , which is to transfer security responsibility to the Iraqis as the situation permits , " she said after a meeting in Berlin with the German foreign minister , Frank - Walter Steinmeier .
" The coalition remains intact and , in fact , the British still have thousands of troops deployed in Iraq . "

The panic that broke out in Second Life last month over a copybot raised many questions about the security of property in the virtual universe .
Unlike most massively multiplayer games ( if you can even call Second Life that ) , Second Life " residents " are allowed to actually own the stuff they create .
So if you could copy endlessly , in what sense could you actually own anything ?
The CopyBot itself may not have been quite dangerous enough to justify all the fuss it caused – but it highlights an interesting crossroads in Second Life 's development .
It had its origins in a project called libsecondlife , which is working on a project ( informally endorsed by Linden Lab ) to open source the Second Life game engine .
This suggests a fascinating possible future for the Second Life universe - But an open source strategy must surely make that fragile economy even more vulnerable .
Linden Lab has been talking about open sourcing SL for a while – and there are lots of good reasons why it might want to .
The Second Life interface is pretty clunky , and the graphics engines are a long way behind the state of the art .
A game like World of Warcraft leaves SL in the shade - possibly one of the reasons why of the million or more who have registered for SL , only a small proportion become regular visitors .
Linden Lab is a tiny company , struggling to develop its product at the pace it should .
As CEO Philip Rosedale admitted in a recent podcast , " We as a roughly 100 person company are stretched to the limit . "
If it can attract a sufficiently large community , an open source project would bring more development resources to bear on Second Life ( though the open source community has n't been terribly good at user interfaces in the past ) .
The first libsecondlife project that the ordinary resident could use would be a new client .
As Jonathan Freedman , a member of libsecondlife , says : " The default Second Life client is rather limited .
It is very feature full .
So you need a decent system to run it . "
So one of the first things they could design is a simpler client for new members .
Big corporates like IBM , who are ardent Second Life fans , could host their own Second Life instances , and adapt it for other purposes – like training or conferencing .
Open source developers could also work on better integration between Second Life and other projects , from simple web browsing to other online universes , such as WoW .
If you consider SL not as a game , but just a rather fancy 3d chat application , then that seems more or less what you 'd expect .
Instead of a single service provider , you have multiple interconnected service providers , set up by anyone who feels the need .
With the proliferation of WiFi and cell phones , does anybody mail postcards anymore ?
I have n’t gotten one in years , so I assume the answer is “ no . ”
If , however , on your next trip you decide that you not only want to send a postcard , but you want to do something unique , why not send a card from an underwater mailbox ?
Though not common , there are five underwater mailboxes for you to visit :
I ’d love to get a postcard sent from an underwater mailbox .
The first person to send me one gets an Amazon gift certificate worth 10 times the amount of the postage .
WASHINGTON , Nov. 19 — Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger , who regularly advises President Bush on Iraq , said today that a full military victory was no longer possible there .
He thus joined a growing number of leading conservatives openly challenging the administration ’s conduct of the war and positive forecasts for it .
“ If you mean , by ‘ military victory , ’ an Iraqi government that can be established and whose writ runs across the whole country , that gets the civil war under control and sectarian violence under control in a time period that the political processes of the democracies will support , I do n’t believe that is possible , ” Mr. Kissinger told BBC News .
In Washington , a leading Republican supporter of the war , Senator John McCain of Arizona , said American troops in Iraq were “ fighting and dying for a failed policy . ”
But Mr. McCain continued to argue vigorously for a short - term surge in American forces , and he gained a vocal ally in Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , another influential Republican , who said , “ We ’re going to lose this war if we do n’t adjust quickly . ”
An average American drinks three cups of coffee per day so it is fair to say that coffee drinkers should be mindful of the kind of coffee they choose to drink .
There are so many methods to prepare coffee that it can be hard to choose the right one for you .
Most people that drink coffee regularly purchase a coffee maker to make the brewing process easier .
The variety of coffee makers can give some buyers a headache but it is a good thing that we have access to that many kinds because it gives everyone a chance to find the perfect one for their needs .
In this article , we are going to take a look at two of the most commonly found coffee appliances , percolators and drip coffee makers .
Coffee percolators
A coffee percolator can come in two types , electric and stove - top .
A traditional percolator works by allowing the hot water to pass through the beans sitting at the top part of the pot again and again .
This brings out the rich flavor of coffee beans and allows one to enjoy a strong cup of coffee that is sure to awaken anyone even if they did n’t get enough sleep .
Percolators come with a filter basket so in theory there is no need to purchase any paper filters .
Some prefer to put one on top of the basket anyway to filter out some of the smaller beans and give the coffee a slightly weaker taste .
You can get percolator coffee filters in any larger retail store for a small price .
Percolators used to be the most popular kind of coffee maker until the 70s .
Nowadays , they have been replaced by other appliances but some coffee lovers argue that nothing beats a coffee made by a traditional percolator .
Many people buy them not only for the coffee taste but also the nostalgic value .
Drip coffee makers
Drip coffee makers were the main reason percolators went out of style .
They are probably the most popular type of coffee maker today because of their simplicity .
This easy to use coffee maker only requires you to put in the coffee beans and water to enjoy a freshly brewed cup of coffee .
After the coffee is ready it is then dispensed into a glass pot .
The pot sits atop a hot plate so that the coffee is always warm and ready to drink .
The main disadvantage of drip coffee makers is the hot plate part .
The brewed coffee can sit for many hours inside the pot and it is being ‘ cooked ’ all the time because of the heat source .
This can distort the taste of the coffee and make it undrinkable for some .
Because of their popularity , drip coffee makers are available in many different sizes and styles .
You will probably be able to get a good one in any price range .
If neither of these is your cup of tea ( or coffee ! ) feel free to choose something completely different .
For example , an espresso machine .
If you are going to be drinking coffee three times a day , make sure it is a beverage you actually enjoy .
You should know one thing before you read my review of Ricardo Semler ’s excellent book The Seven - Day Weekend :
He ’s my idol .
I ’ve read his books and followed his work and I ’m a fan .
Completely , unashamedly , unreservedly , probably in the same way that 14 - year old girls are fans of Justin Timberlake .
If he ever comes to Copenhagen to give a speech , I ’ll be in the front row , screaming my little lungs out .
Ahem .
I deeply admire Ricardo Semler .
He ’s the CEO of the Sao Paulo , Brazil - based company Semco , and his vision of leadership has been the driving force behind an organization so different , so innovative and so successful that the business world has been forced to sit up and pay attention .
That ’s admirable but it ’s not the most important reason why Ricardo is my idol .
The core reason is this : Semler has chosen happiness as his driving force in business .
He enjoys life and he wants Semco ’s employees , customers , suppliers and community to be happy as well .
That is the real motivation behind Semco .
Not growth .
Not profits .
Not power .
Not status .
But happiness .
This is why Semco has chosen to do things … somewhat differently .
At Semco :
Employees set their own working hours
Employees choose their own salaries
All meetings are voluntary and open to everyone
Employees hire their own bosses
HR has been almost abolished , because leaders need to be able to treat their employees right themselves
All employees rate their bosses twice a year and all ratings are published
Employees choose which leader they want to work under
Employees choose which Semco office they want to work out off
Employees can take early retirement , meaning they get one day a week off in return for working one day a week after they retire .
Etcetra , etcetera , et- fricking - cetera …
It ’s hard to find a single aspect of traditional organization and management that Semco has n’t either blown up , reinvented , abolished or turned upside down .
I like it !
Semler first described his vision in the aptly titled book Maverick ( also an excellent read ) .
The Seven - Day Weekend was written about ten years later and goes even further .
The title references Semler ’s belief that life cannot be divided into work and free time any more .

Semco wants employees who are 100 % themselves on the job or off it .
Consequently , they treat employees as adults who are capable of making decisions for themselves .
In return , people respond by honoring that trust and delivering fantastic results .
The book is full of stories from Semco ’s everyday existence , and these stories are a joy to read .
Time and again these stories illustrate , that Semco does not choose the easy way out .
The easy , safe and comfortable way is to fall back on well - known , hierarchical control structures .
Semco consistently resists this temptation and instead chooses to believe in its people and its corporate values .
As a result , on of Semco ’s top management ’s most important leadership tools is … inaction .
Not to do anything .
To not interfere and to let the organization work out an issue on its own .
To trust the process they ’ve defined and see where that takes them .
Not out of a laissez - faire management style or a fear of conflict ( if anything , Brazilians seem to relish conflict ) , but out of a realization that every time top executives step in and mandate a solution , they rob the rest of the organization of initiative and the will to act .
This is without a shadow of a doubt the best and most important book on leadership I have ever had the pleasure to read .
This book quite simply rocks , and any leader who reads it will be able to pluck dozens of useful , practical and innovative ideas from it ’s pages .
It ’s an easy , fun read , the stories are told amazingly well and the book is 100 % free of MBA - jargon .
Read it !!!

Mark Cuban wrote an interesting blog today " Internet Video and how the broadcast nets are missing the HDTV opportunity " .
Mark makes lots of good points about the future of Internet video that deserve a post all to itself .
One of the main points is that Google / Yahoo / Microsoft will be the gatekeepers and consolidators of Internet Video and be the " one stop shop " for advertisers .
Then Mark segues into the HDTV opportunity where he says HDTV will kill Internet Video .
I disagree , but more on that in another post .
On the future of Internet video , Mark says ;
" If its a hassle for ad buyers to buy 100 TV networks , how much of a hassle do you think its going to be for them to buy 100 websites and get them audited ?
Whats more , what do you think all those Web 2.0 sites who are easily selling video ad inventory today because its a nice experiment for advertisers do when they cant sell their video inventory any longer ?
Or when the biggest advertisers tell them they have to work through a publisher network like Yahoo or Google in order for them to get a buy ?
Well , the first thing they are going to do is lower their ad prices .
Which is exactly what we saw happen both on smaller digital video networks and on websites trying to sell display advertising .
Its history repeating itself . "
To summarize , Internet video advertising rates will fall due to saturation of sites , and advertisers will only buy ads through major publishing networks like Google , Yahoo , and Microsoft to maintain quality , auditability , and ease of management .
Advertisers , Publishers , Consumers -
There are three sides to the Internet advertising puzzle ; the Advertisers who pay for it , the Content Publishers who create or aggregate the content and take the money , and the Consumers who watch / read the content and click on the ads .
We are Consumers so we tend to look at everything through that lens .
Google has been successful because it has found a way to satisfy all three sides of the equation .
Web Advertising - Advertisers get to target their ads and only pay when a consumer clicks .
The millions of small web site content publishers ( long tail ) get an automated way to put ads on their sites and let Google collect the money and pay them a royalty .
Consumers get a great search experience free of ad banner clutter , and actually find the targeted text ads helpful .
Radio Advertising - Google will take the same model to radio advertising with its dMark Broadcasting acquisition .
Initially there will be very little ad targeting .
The main " value add " will be the ability for the advertiser to efficiently place and track ads on lots of different radio stations , all from one console .
The radio stations may be able to auction their ads to the highest bidder , rather than use ad sales people to sell off a rate card .
Video Advertising - Google , Yahoo , and Microsoft could again apply to same model to Internet video .
The key to success here is to build a comprehensive network of sites that offer lots of video content .
Then use technology to target the ads to the relevant content .
The YouTube acquisition certainly helps build up an inventory of content , and an audience of users .
Mark Cuban 's point about advertisers wanting to place , and track , ad buys through one source or network applies to all three markets ; web , radio , and video .
What is the next logical step ?
TV , Newspaper , and Magazine advertising .
Why not apply the same economies of scale , targeting , tracking , and reporting to the TV , Newspaper , and Magazine advertising buying process ?
Google is all about making the advertising process efficient for advertisers and content providers .
Search was just the first implementation .
Why not do the same thing for all forms of advertising .

CYCLISTS ' APOCRYPHA
In the beginning God created the bicycle , saw that it was good , then went for a nice Sunday ride on the bike lanes
He 'd made the day before , and they were good , too , because they were new and He had the angels keep them clear of debris .
Later , of course , God would get cross and have the flood wash them all away .
And God said to Himself , Let us create man , because cycling is too much fun to keep to Myself , and so He created man , him did He create , create did He him do .
And God put man in paradise , and commanded him , Glideth upon the earth anywhere thou wisheth , except for that big hill over there .
For on the day thou goeth down that hill , thou shalt surely die .
And God said , Man needs a companion to keep him from spending too much money on new bicycles .
So God caused man to fall into a deep sleep by asking him if he wanted to go clothes shopping at the mall , then took a rib from him .
Then God said to Himself , Who am I kidding , I 'll never hear the end of it when she finds out she was just a rib , so He created woman from frankincense and myrrh and a certain je ne sais quoi .
And God said , Let man have dominion over lathe drills and Philips head screwdrivers , and let woman have dominion over everything else , and as long as thou art naked and unashamed , thou might as well be fruitful and multiply .
Lastly ,
God created the chicken and the egg , in that order , which should clear up that matter .
Now the serpent , he was a wily one , and he said to woman , Yea , hath God said you may cycle anywhere but down that hill ?
And the woman said unto the serpent , That 's about the size of it : go downhill and die .
And the serpent said , Ye shall not surely die , you probably wo n't even fall off .
For God doth know that on the day you go downhill , you will not need to pedal for a long time .
Go on , give it a try .
And the woman saw that the hill was good , she did not need to pedal for a long time .
She told the man about it , and he also went downhill .
Their eyes were opened , they saw they were naked , and they sewed fig leaves into padded cycling shorts because sometimes it got bumpy going downhill .
And they heard the voice of God as He was offroad , fully suspended of course , and they hid their bicycles at the bottom of the hill and started whistling nervously .
And God called unto the man , and said , Where art thou ?
And the man said , We art down here .
And God said , Hast thou cycled downhill , whereoff I commanded thee that thou shouldest not ?
And man said , It was her idea .
And God said unto the woman , I will greatly multiply thy sorrow whilst climbing hills ; in pain shalt thou perch upon thy saddle .
And God said unto the man , Because thou hast harkened unto the voice of thy wife , cursed is regular bike maintenance .
The inner workings of the hub gear will be beyond thou to repair .
In the sweat of thy face shalt thou service thy freewheel .
And God said , Behold , the man does n't listen very well , so he kicked him out of paradise and guarded the entrance with a sign of a picture of a bicycle in the middle of a red circle .
And He had a Cherubim with a flaming sword stop by a few times a week for good measure .
This is the book of the generations .
The first bicycle was a single speed , Godspeed , but after that it got complicated .
Sprockets begat sprockets and cables begat kinks .
Celerifere begat Draisienne begat Macmillan begat Michaux begat Ariel begat Bayliss Thomas begat Lawson begat Rover begat Boneshaker begat Ordinary begat Raleigh .
And it came to pass , when men began to multiply on the face of the earth in a critical mass , God saw that the wickedness of man was great and he did not like to give way to anyone on the road even his mother , so He directed Noah to build an ark made out of renewable resources .
There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark every type of bicycle : one to ride and one for spare parts .
And Noah gathered two touring bikes and two mountain bikes ; two recumbents and two tandems ; two road racing bikes and two cross bikes ; also four unicycles , just in case there was a misunderstanding , and a brace of Bromptons , as their folded countenance pleasethed Him .
And God said there might be Some strong winds in the Southeast .
And it rained for 40 days and 40 nights , then drizzled for another fortnight .
And God remembered Noah and asswaged the waters , and Noah opened a door on the ark and set loose Japheth on a unicycle , and God said This is a covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature : that a man on a unicycle is a hilarious sight .
The waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh .
A bit later , God spake unto Moses , saying , Here are a few ground rules , I hath numbered them for thou for easy reference :
I . Thou shalt hold no other races above the Tour de France .
II .
Thou shalt not make unto thee helmets which cost more than £ 100 .
III .
Thou shalt not take
My name in vain everytime thou gettest a flat tyre .
IV .
Remember to oil thy chain , to keep it rolling .
V. Honour the Zebra Crossing and those walking upon the face of it .
VI .
Thou shalt not ignore other road users , nor cycle recklessly upon the pavement .
VII .
Thou shalt not steal bicycles .
VIII .
Thou shalt not kill , except bicycle thieves .
IX .
Thou shalt not hang onto moving cars .
X . Thou shalt not covet they neighbour 's new Cannondale , nor his groupset , nor his £ 3000 mtb , nor even his stylish shades .
Forget not the Titanium Rule : Signal unto others as thou wouldst have others signal unto thou .
And moving right along , there came four horsemen of the Apocalypse , and they were the Taxicab Driver , and the Motorcycle Messenger , and the White Van Man , and the Man Opening a Car Door Without Looking .

WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
The Magazine answers ...
Seatbelts off
It 's a heady mix .
There 's the adrenaline of flying at 30,000 feet on the way to exotic shores and the frisson of illicit temptation .
And maybe even the business class champagne .
Sex on an aeroplane - after the seatbelt lights are off , naturally - makes good reading for fans of blockbuster romance novels , but for some it is more than just a fantasy .
Janet Jackson and Richard Branson are self - confessed members of the " Mile - High Club " and Ralph Fiennes may have joined them .
Qantas is investigating whether the British actor had sex with a flight attendant on a flight from Darwin to Mumbai .
And entrepreneur Mike Crisp has launched a service on his six - seater private plane for couples who wish to get amorous for 90 minutes while being flown above the English countryside .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular feature in the BBC News Magazine - aiming to answer some of the questions behind the headlines
A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman says he is unaware of any prosecutions .
" The police would need to have a complaint and they would then investigate , and if they thought there was a case to answer then we would make a judgement on whether there 's a case to bring forward . "
What legislation is invoked depends on the circumstances , he says , and the police would look at the offence as a whole before deciding if laws such as outraging public decency have been infringed .
Public decency
Getting frisky in the plane toilet could be a criminal offence , says travel lawyer Philip Banks , from the firm Irwin Mitchell .
A person has committed an offence if they have sex in a lavatory to which the public has access , under section 71 of the Sexual Offences Act 2004 .
Airlines can hand down their own punishments
Outraging public decency under common law could also be used , he says , if it was proven that at least one person may have seen the act .
But it may not be the UK laws which come into play , and which country 's laws govern the offence may depend on the destination , the departure point , the country over which the offence is committed and the country where the plane is registered , says criminal lawyer Julian Young .
But despite the confessions of the rich and famous , there are few known instances of anyone getting caught .
Amanda Holt , 37 , and David Machin , 40 , were charged with outraging public decency in 1999 and subsequently fined after having sex in their seats on an American Airlines flight from Dallas to Manchester .
But generally getting caught red - handed is rare .
One senior member of British Airways ' cabin crew , who does not want to be named , says he 's never encountered it in 10 years of flying .
And a BA spokeswoman says they could call the police .
A self - confessed club member
" But if we believe they have broken the law or they 've caused upset to other people and there 's been a complaint , we could go to the police . "
Although the airline cannot fine passengers , it can ban them for offensive behaviour , although she 's unaware if this has ever happened .
There is nothing in transport law governing the matter of having sex on public transport .
And the Civil Aviation Authority says there 's nothing specific about it in aviation law - but there are other considerations .
" To comply with health and safety laws , they would have to be sitting with their seatbelts on for take - off and landing , " a spokeswoman says .
And to join the club while strapped in would take some doing .
It 's not always in the toilet .
On a flight home from India , my friend 's flatmate simply waited ' til the lights went down and everyone else was asleep before joining the club with the bloke sitting next to her .
She insisted that the person sharing their row of seats never woke up , but who sleeps that heavily on a plane ?
Patsy , Sheffield
It should be made illegal .
There are children flying with their parents .
Allowing something like this means lowering the standard of public decency .
One may insists he is not breaking law and offend the other passanger and may cause argument hence causing disturbance to the air crew & passanger alike .
Commonsense has to rule .
Vast majority of people are descent and have an understanding of social responsibility .
Moe , London , UK
What if you 're on a long - haul flight and the aircraft is over International Waters when you join the club ?
Surely no laws apply then - except for possibly the airline 's carriage rules ?
Glenn Jones , Birmingham , UK
Glen 's comment about being safe from prosecution over international waters is an interesting one .
If you are over international waters can you murder your partner / friends / boss ?
I doubt it .
So laws must still apply .
Martin , London
Once the doors have been locked , the applicable law is that of the vessel .
In BA and Virgin 's case that would be English law , which punishes having sex in a public facility toilet under section 71 of the Sexual Offences Act 2004 .
Robert , London
I joined the Mile High club while travelling to Cyprus with my boyfriend at the time .
No one saw and we did n't get caught and I do n't regret it for a second .
It 's harmless fun but I would never even have considered doing it anywhere else on the plane in view of others or while others were sleeping , that 's not right .
I can't see how it might offend others or be illegal whilst it 's behind a closed door - if I cottoned on to it happening on a flight between two consenting adults I 'd just smile .
Rachel , Cambridge
Nothing will ever beat the raucous cheering and clapping that woke me up on a flight to Australia when the two strangers in front of me " returned to their seats " from the loos .
The last I 'd heard was the two of them discussing ( a bit loudly , I must say ) their respective failed relationships over a drink or two , as I was drifting off to sleep behind them .
He was dead - chuffed , she was distraught .
Adam , London
I have observed a couple coming out of a public toilet separately and there is no sight more tacky in the world .
Diane , Sutton
Aircraft toilet a public place ?
A bit of tight squeeze , especially on Lufthansa City Line , you 're lucky if you can stand upright alone , never mind with a companion .
Geoffrey Ellis , Cheshire / Hamburg
As a frequent flier , I was unnerved to read that Viagra is to be sold over - the - counter under a " pilot scheme " .
David Dee , Matola Mozambique
If anything should be made illegal , it should be that Viagra joke .

He further insults the officer , calling him a " donut eater , " and insisting that he is " going to hell . "
Many working days are lost to colds
Scientists say they have the first proof that there really is a link between getting cold and catching one .
Staff at the Common Cold Centre in Cardiff took 180 volunteers and asked half of them to keep their bare feet in icy water for 20 minutes .
They found 29 % developed a cold within five days , compared with only 9 % in the control group not exposed to a chill .
Mothers can now be confident in their advice to children to wrap up well in winter
Prof Ron Eccles , Common Cold Centre
Professor Ronald Eccles , director of the centre , said the study had shown , for the first time , a scientific link between chilling and viral infection - something previously dismissed by other studies .
" When colds are circulating in the community , many people are mildly infected but show no symptoms , " Prof Eccles said .
" If they become chilled , this causes a pronounced constriction of the blood vessels in the nose and shuts off the warm blood that supplies the white cells that fight infection .
" The reduced defences in the nose allow the virus to get stronger and common cold symptoms develop .
" Although the chilled subject believes they have ' caught a cold ' what has , in fact , happened is that the dormant infection has taken hold . "
The Common Cold Centre , at Cardiff University , is the world 's only centre dedicated to researching and testing new medicines for the treatment of flu and the common cold .
The volunteers in the study were recruited during the peak common cold season - October to March .
Cold noses
While half sat with their feet in chilled in ice - cold water for 20 minutes the others had their feet in an empty bowl .
The research findings published in the medical journal , Family Practice say the fact that common colds are more prevalent in the winter could be related to an increased incidence of chilling causing more clinical colds .
But another explanation could be our noses are colder in winter .
" A cold nose may be one of the major factors that causes common colds to be seasonal , " Prof Eccles explained .
" When the cold weather comes , we wrap ourselves up in winter coats to keep warm , but our nose is directly exposed to the cold air .
" Cooling of the nose slows down clearance of viruses from the nose and slows down the white cells that fight infection .
" Mothers can now be confident in their advice to children to wrap up well in winter . "
I was amazed to see the article concerning the C implemented Apache versus the Erlang implemented Yaws and immediately went looking for how Erlang emulated its processes .
What I could not find after reading " Making reliable distributed systems in the presence of software errors " , and " The development of Erlang " was what was making the magic happen .
What is this high level of concurrency attributed to ; bytecode instructions , abstractions built upon continuations , erlang - style trampolines , what ?
I would like to learn more about concurrency in general ( and more specifically , its implementation ) , even to the point of playing around with these new ideas in Common Lisp and Scheme .
I have reviewed CL - MUPROC , Termite , and Distel ; and so far Distel seems to be the most interesting due to its lack of need for any underlying thread or process implemenation .
Can anyone provide me some insight , whether explaination as to how Erlang makes process magic or Lisp equivalents , or reference readings to learn more about the subject .
Thank you for your time ,
Mark Stahl

Jordan Gates Fall Down
The highly anticipated architectural monuments of Amman , the Jordan Gates , have met a sad development as the three stories of the north tower collapsed killing 2 and injuring at least 20 , mostly Egyptians and some Jordanians .
The causes are unknown but the Interior Ministry points to faulty engineering and the project has been shutdown pending an investigation .
It brings up some important issues I ’ve been thinking about for the past few years .
In the mid to late 90 ’s construction in Amman began to grow and real estate in general saw a boom from the influx of Iraqi exiles .
Construction companies have made a killing , literally .
Yet they are still so eager to cut costs by not following any safety regulations on construction sites , or even using cheaper material .
I have never seen an Egyptian worker even dressed properly let alone given a safety helmet .
Most of them wear what can generously be described as sandals , let alone work boots , or even socks .
And you ca n’t blame them , it ’s not like they ’re being paid a lot of money and what little they make is sent off to the homeland .
Yet these companies continue to allow the situation to deteriorate in this manner .
I ’ve seen 14 year olds suddenly running down the street away from their worksites when they see a cop car approaching .
And then you have our government : a lot of these companies have family connections with mostly ex-government officials that smooth out their operations .
Permits , regulations , many of these things are bypassed for the sake of profit .
Moreover , safety regulations and / or policies are barely implemented if at all .
Everyone in Amman has lived next to a construction site at one point in time or another , and everyone has been a witness to the situation .
I have never seen any sort of oversight committee or task force or any ministry official checking up on these sites at random to ensure worker safety , site safety , neighborhood safety or even the materials being used .
Stone , cement , sand , nails , planks of wood everywhere so let ’s forget about the environmental concerns or even the worker ’s rights .
At the very least one would expect these companies to adhere to regulations or even show a sense of humanity with regards to their workers and the people they are building for .
And things will only get worse if both construction companies and the government turns a blind eye to the situation while Amman and Jordan explodes with massive expansion in the years to come .
What exactly happened with the Jordan Gates is yet to be revealed but with a track record like this I expect someone was cutting costs and someone was making a hefty profit off it .
China ’s legislature is considering a bill that would grant increased protection for individual property rights
BEIJING , March 8 —
In preparation for likely approval , China ’s legislature on Thursday began examining a much - debated law that helps protect private property in an increasingly well - off society .
Though the Communist Party still believes the state owns all land , the growing economy has meant that private property “ has been increasing with each passing day ” and the protection of it is the “ urgent demand of the people , ” the draft legislation states .
The latest draft of the property law seeks to strike a delicate balance between the need to continue greasing the wheels of the Chinese economy – which depends on private investment – and satisfying old guard officials reluctant to see the socialist ideals they have relied on since 1949 jettisoned .
“ As the reform and opening - up and the economy develop , people ’s living standards have improved in general , and they urgently require effective protection of their own lawful property accumulated through hard work , ” said Wang Zhaoguo , Deputy Chairman of the National People ’s Congress , in introducing the latest draft of the measure to the legislature .
Individuals shall own “ their lawful incomes , houses , articles for daily use , means of production and raw materials , ” the legislation states .
“ Lawful deposits and investments of individual persons and the gains derived from their investments shall be protected by law . ”
Illegally taking possession or destroying any such property is forbidden .

If you ’re a software developers , absolutely !!!
No doubt about it !
Before I go on , let me just take a step back to explain what a code profiler is to those that are n’t familiar with the term since a lot of you here also are n’t software developers .
And surprisingly , a lot of software developers have no idea what a code profiler is !
A code profiler is a software application that helps you find performance bottlenecks , pin down memory leaks and resolve threading issues in your software application .
So in other words , it ’s a tool that helps you find where your own software needs the most improvement .
You would think that with today ’s amazingly fast machines you would n’t need to worry so much about performance or memory ( threading is something you always have to worry about ) .
Yes , that ’s partially true , but not always !
For LandlordMax , as the database becomes progressively larger , so does the importance of running a code profiler .
As some of you may have noticed , we ’ve really been pushing performance enhancements recently ( for example : here and here ) , and there ’s a reason why .
When we initially ran our tests , we ran them with fairly large databases , but we ’d only test one section at a time .
Lately we ’ve been really pushing the envelop , creating databases that are larger than any of our customers will ever have , and we ’ve noticed some performance issues with these massive databases , as well as some memory issues .
So then the question becomes , why not just optimize everything ?
Because that ’s incredibly time consuming and very expensive .
But more importantly , it ’s often a waste of time and money .
Most of the improvements you ’ll do wo n’t make any noticeable difference .
For example , if a screen refreshes in 10 ms versus 20 ms , no one will notice , it ’s too fast to be perceptible , even if it ’s a doubling in speed !
However the cost of this improvement may be significant , hence driving up the cost of the software !
No one wants this , and there ’s no real benefit to anyone in this case .
So what we ’re left with is focusing on the main performance bottlenecks .
How do we do this ?
Most people will think that you just look at code , it should be obvious .
It ’s not !
Often where you think there ’s a bottleneck is just plain wrong .
This is one of the hardest things to do !
So where does this leave us ?
How do we do this ?
We could integrate within our application a bunch of timers , memory readouts , etc. that would continually post information out to the screen .
I ’d suggest against this because this is very time consuming , error prone , has the high probability of introducing unncessary bugs , and adds a lot of extra code to your application .
A better solution is to use a code profiling application .
As LandlordMax is Java based , I can only talk about the Java code profiling application .
There ’s 4 main software solutions , all ranging greatly in price , how they tackle the problem of profiling , what features they offer , etc .
They are : JProfiler , YourKit , OptimizeIt , and JProbe .
After some analysis , I narrowed our list of options down to either JProfiler or YourKit .
I simply could n’t justify the cost of OptimizeIt , and JProbe seemed still stuck back about a decade in terms of GUI ( it just was n’t friendly to work with at all ) .
I did personally contact both of the companies I was interested in evaluating ( JProfiler and YourKit ) and told them I was going to write a review here on FollowSteph.com about this topic .
Both were enthusiastic about it , and each was willing to provide me with a free license to their application ( thank you ! ) so that I could really try out their software packages .
It ’s great to see this kind of enthusiasm !
It ’s also great to see companies that really believe in their products !
That being said , after some experimenting , I ’m going to say that I prefer JProfiler .
YourKit was nice , but I found JProfiler ’s interface much more intuitive , it provided me the information I needed in a very organized and obvious manner .
This made finding the bottlenecks and memory issues much faster and easier !
Therefore in my opinion , although both tools are powerful , but I recommend JProfiler as the better alternative .
To give you a few examples of some of the phenomenal improvements we got with LandlordMax , before we started using JProfiler , we ran a rent roll report that generated 521 pages of rents due ( that ’s a big database ! ) in less than 14 minutes .
That seemed reasonable to us when you consider the size of the report .
This same report now runs on my computer in 12 seconds !!!
Yes you read that right , in 12 seconds !
When we ran it with JProfiler , the performance bottleneck jumped right out at us .
It was not at all where we thought it was , we had been focusing on the wrong area of code .
Had we not used JProfiler for this , we could have spent many more hours , possibly days , trying to improve the performance and it would have only been minor , maybe we would have shredded one minute from the total time , nothing like what we achieved .
Also , remember that the time cost to fix this was extremely small , once we saw it in the “ CPU Views ” section , it was a no - brainer .
Solving it was n’t obvious , but locating the source of the issue was !
Much like locating the leak in a pipe can be brutal , but once you know where it is , solving it is n’t nearly as difficult .
With JProfiler we were able to find it in seconds , with just one pass of the report .
Although I ’ve been mostly mentioning performance bottlenecks , memory leaks ( or extraneous usage ) can and also does happen .
While running JProfiler we also found that we used more memory than necessary in many places .
We immediately saw that our “ instance ” count was extremely high for Vector Objects ( a Java library object that stores a list of other objects ) .
Why was our instance count so high ?
By quickly drilling down JProfiler ’s Call Tree , we immediately noticed the issue .
What was happening is that for each Model Object we created ( a chunk of programming code that represents either a real world object or a concept ) , we were pre-creating several empty Vectors ( lists ) .
I know that without a context this does n’t make much sense , so let ’s give it a context .
So for example , when we created a new Building Object , we would pre-create an empty Vector ( list ) of units , of accounting entries , and every other item that might be in the tabbed panels .
There ’s nothing wrong with that .
When we were in the list view ( where you would only see the list of buildings without the details ) , we only populated the basic building information so that it could be drawn in the table , not the full data ( the list of accounting entries , etc. ) .
We did n’t populate these lists ( accounting entries , etc. ) for every building because you might never view most of the buildings every time .
Why take the performance and memory hit to pre-populate all the data if you probably will only use a small portion of it .
Therefore we ’d only populate the lists ( accounting entries , etc. ) for a building when that building was selected .
This way , only when we actually look at the details of a building do we put information in our Vector Objects ( accounting entries , etc. ) .
So how can there be a memory leak here ?
Well there is n’t one really .
But what happens is that when we created a new Building we ’d also create several empty lists ( accounting entries , etc. ) by creating a new Vector Object with no items in it .
Still do n’t see where the memory leak is ?
To be honest in retrospect it ’s really obvious , but at the time I had n’t really thought of it .
The memory leak is that each of those empty Vectors Objects take memory .
Each Vector Object has to be created ( instantiated and allocated ) .
Although the list contains nothing , the Vector Object does take up space .
If you only have a few hundred buildings , it ’s almost unoticeable .
But now imagine that you have thousands of buildings , each with about a dozen empty Vector Objects !
What about if you run a rent roll report like the one above with 521 pages of Objects each containing a dozen or so empty Vector Objects ( lists ) !
I was n’t even looking for a memory issue in this area of the code , but by just running JProfiler while performing some random tasks quickly brought this to my attention .
Of course , I had I run LandlordMax with a database of only a few hundred buildings I probably would n’t have noticed anything .
You see in Object Oriented Languages such as Java , almost everything is an Object , there ’s lots of Objects .
Each Screen is an Object itself composed of many other Objects ( Button Objects , Label Objects , etc. ) .
There are Objects everywhere .
But in this case because the database was much larger , the Object count quickly got out of proportion and it became very obvious when looking at the metrics within JProfiler .
So to fix this little issue , all we had to do is go from created empty Vectors ( lists ) to using lazy instantiation .
What that means is that we do n’t even create an empty Vector , all we basically do is say this is where the list will go in memory .
We do n’t actually put a list there , not even an empty one .
In Java , we assign it the value of “ null ” .
Without getting too technical , variables generally point to the Object in memory , they do n’t store the actual Object ( pass by reference rather than pass by value ) .
So when we put “ null ” , we do n’t need to worry about allocating that Vector Object right now , we can deal with it later if need be ( or never if we do n’t need to ) .
if you want more details this article explains it in a lot more detail .
Anyways , doing this greatly reduced the amount of memory we used everywhere .
Had I not run a code profiler like JProfiler , I do n’t think I would have noticed this .
It ’s not a show stopper , but the less memory your software uses the better , and generally the faster it is .
It did n’t need to create and destroy all these empty Vector object instances for nothing .
Another great benefit we quickly got with JProfiler is that it showed us our data entry screens needed some performance boosts .
Up until now , we generally focused on the list views , as those are the ones that contain the biggest amount of data .
But JProfiler quickly brought to our attention that the combo boxes can be performance issues .
For example , when I go to create a new accounting entry where the database contains over 2000 tenants , 2000 buildings , 2000 vendors , etc. , each of these respective combo boxes need to be redrawn ( in case any data updates were made ) .
Each combo box requires a database call .
Each combo box requires some Objects to be created and destroyed as they are updated .
This quickly added up and became really apparent with a large database just by looking at the screens within JProfiler .
Because of this , we ’ve now added some caching to LandlordMax which will be available in the next major release .
As I mentioned earlier in this article , we could have cached everything , but because of JProfiler we focused on only caching the combo boxes that had performance and memory bottlenecks ( which ended up only being 5 combo boxes ) .
Talk about a time saver !
I ca n’t imagine having created caching for everything !
By analyzing the metrics , we found that 99 % of the performance bottlenecks could be attributed to only 5 combo boxes , which is a lot less than hundreds of potential combo boxes , labels , prefilled data entry fields , etc .
As a quick side note , those of you who are n’t familiar , caching is a way of storing information in memory so that it does n’t have to be retrieved from the database each time ( and also a way of re-using the same Object instances rather than re-creating new ones each time ) .
Because of this , if no changes occur between screens ( for example no tenants are added , removed , or modified ) , the combo box is virtually instantaneously drawn and consumes no extra memory .
If a change do occur ( a tenant ’s name is modified , etc. ) , we now just update the cached tenant list so that it still does n’t require a full database call or the creation of new objects .
If you have thousands of tenants , buildings , units , vendors , etc. , this can quickly add up .
Before I finish this article , I just wanted to point out JProfiler ’s “ Hot Spot ” functionality which is available for memory and performance analysis .
This is basically a feature within the software that tries to actively point out to you where the bottlenecks are , so that you do n’t have to look any further .
Think of it as a summary of where you should look next , where you should look to enhance your software .
It ’s a nice little feature .
Now that I think about it , it ’s almost like it generates a “ to do ” list for you on where you should focus your time and money to enhance performance .
So have I convinced you that you ( at least you software developers and software company owners ) that you should run a code profiler for your software application if you have n’t already done so ?
I hope so !
These were only some of the highlights we got from using JProfiler , there were others ( I did n’t even mention any of it ’s thread analyzing capabilities ! ) .
As you can tell , I really benefited from using JProfiler , so I definitely recommend them , especially if you ’re coding in Java .
The value in terms of time , cost , and benefits is definitely worth it !
Michael Jackson has reportedly closed down his Neverland Ranch funfair for good - and sold his amusement rides for $ 500,000 ( £ 277,800 ) .

The pop superstar , who now calls the Middle East home , chose not to return to his Santa Barbara County , California estate after it was raided by police looking for evidence into his 2004 and 2005 child molestation case .
And , after finding homes for the wild pets Jackson housed on his sprawling estate , he has now sold his playthings to a Japanese collector .
The new owner plans to open a theme park dedicated to Jackson in his native Japan .
I 've decided .
My first official act as Chief Executive Officer will be to hire a Yes Man .
Think about it : how could there possibly be a better way to receive feedback ?
I 'll come up with some great , big idea and , just before I had a chance to realize how truly brilliant it is , I 'll have some one already there , enumerating its pros and pros .
I see that Jimm 's program manager has taken a similar approach .
At a fairly late stage in the project , he hired Jimm to take on a quality management role so that he would , presumably , remind everyone how great the quality was .
But Jimm was n't content doing that ; oh no , he had to go and find bugs , and lots of them .
You see , Jimm 's manager , in addition to being a model leader , was also a cost - conscious one .
He realized how completely unnecessary project managers , architects , designers , developers , and testers were for the phase of the project , so he and his small team prototyped the first few thousand lines of code and shipped the rest overseas to be completed .
And then he brought in " all those other people , " including Jimm .
Obviously , that caused things to get a little mixed up , so architects ended up doing the testing , developers did the project management , and Jimm 's manager became the Issue Master .
What that meant was that every bug that Jimm ( or one of the other architects ) found went straight to the manager for prioritization .
The issue prioritization process was fairly simple , too .
A bug would be reported and the manager would defend it with his common reply , " I can see how you think that might cause a problem ; it 's not ideal , but it 's not a show stopper , either . "
Jimm received this reply when he reported a fairly serious design flaw : the code did n't have any transactional logic .
A typical page request involved executing 20 - 25 different SQL queries and , if any of these failed ( which , they often would ) , it would result in things getting in a strange " half - state . "
The only way to fix things after that was through several painful , manual crediting processes by customer service .
But Jimm was n't satisfied with the standard reply .
He knew it would be chaotic , especially when hundreds of simultaneous users were introduced to the system .
Jimm argued , pushed , complained , and griped , hoping that his manager just might see the criticality of the issue .
He even brought it up in a meeting which , as it turned out , did n't work so well .
" So what ? " his manager barked , " our software has the ** small * * flaw of creating a few extra rows in the database .
Big deal , who cares ?!? "
The manager , furious , then instituted a change of policy : " I need you to stop reviewing the code and finding all of these ' issues ' .
We need a production deployment plan . "
The message was clear .
No , not in the sense of do we need the fuel , but rather why go through this long , complex and relatively inefficient process of making the liquid , when , for just the price of grinding it down to micron size , you can mix the coal with water and happily drive your vehicle away .
“ Preposterous ! ” I can almost hear the splutters from here , but no , actually it is not , and I thought I would revisit a program that General Electric and others carried out in collaboration with the Department of Energy , between 1982 and 1993 , which explains what some of the problems were and how they were resolved .
There has been a fair amount of discussion about the need to form liquid fuels from coal .
As the more conventional liquid fuels get more expensive , and less easy to find and produce , an alternative source of fuel has been suggested in the Fischer Tropsch conversion of coal into diesel and gasoline .
Can I ask why ?
My initial reference can be downloaded as a pdf from ref. 4 here .
The pre-cursor work comes from Jerald Caton ’s overall review , which can be downloaded as ref. 7 from the same source .
The idea itself is not new .
Rudolph Diesel ran one of his engines with a powdered coal fuel back in 1896 , though the test only ran 7 minutes , before being stopped to see what the dry coal dust had done to the engine .
Dr Caton considers it likely that the coal was at around 100 microns in size , and left the engine gummed with a considerable amount of sludge ( the coal had perhaps 10 % ash ) .
There were later tests of differing engine designs in Germany , all using coal dust , from different sources , but mainly using the German lignite , which has about 20 % ash and particle sizes in the 75 – 100 micron range .
The coal was introduced in a compressed air stream ( about 90 psi ) , but the engines still underwent high wear rates , sludge accumulation and a lack of reliability and control .
These issues had not been solved by the time that the Second World War came to an end and development stopped .
After the war the research largely moved to the United States , with the coal being mixed with various liquids , including diesel itself , in part as a way of getting around the problems of feeding coal particles in compressed air , since this can be an explosive mix , and is difficult to control and provide a constant feed .
Some of the problems can be seen from this reported result
The slurry was used in a commercial Caterpillar diesel engine with an unmodified mechanical fuel injection system .
During the testing the fuel injection system repeatedly failed due to pump plunger and injector nozzle pin seizures .
A wear rate 35 times the normal level was recorded for the piston rings and cylinder liner .
Performance of the engine remained similar regardless of the type of coal mixed with the diesel oil .
Scope limitations and budget constraints ended the research .
The final conclusions were that fuel - injection problems were severe , energy - release characteristics of coal fuels in engines were poor , and that significant wear problems were caused by ash and incompletely combusted particles .
To understand part of the problem with the ignition of the coal , with the higher rpm engines consider that the fuel is injected into the cylinder as a fan mist , and that the fuel must then atomize , ignite , and be totally consumed all within about 10 milliseconds .
This becomes more of a problem as the coal particles get larger , and conversely it meant that by making the particles smaller , it became easier to get the coal to completely combust .
By using 2 micron coal , though only at 15 % concentration in diesel oil , it became possible to get a diesel to run reliably , although the coal was specially prepared to have negligible ash content and nozzle blockage problems still persisted .
Gradually the concentration of coal was increased , to the point that , with a slower cycling engine , it proved possible to run 31 % coal in the diesel , with the coal in the 2 – 10 micron size , and the potential economics of making the transition also began to become evident , as oil prices began to rise in the 1970’s .
It was about this time that the switch was also made to running the coal particles in water , rather than diesel oil , and with mixes up to 34 % coal in water .
Some cited advantages to making the switch ( apart from improving the economics ) were that the combustion temperatures would be lower , reducing disassociation reactions and the oxides of nitrogen .
By the beginning of the 1980 ’s the potentials of the change in fuels were becoming more evident , as well as a clarification of some of the technical problems that would have to be overcome for the technology to reach the market .
And so the Department of Energy began a program where they worked with major diesel manufacturers ( Caterpillar , Cooper - Bessemer , Detroit Diesel , General Electric and General Motors ) and a program at Sandia looked at ways to improve the injector systems .
The Caterpillar program was directed more at an intermediate stage conversion of the coal to gas , but the other four focused on the coal : water combination .
Cooper - Bessemer developed a technique that led to an engine being tested for more than 750 hours , using a coal : water mixture in which the 12 - micron sized coal mixed 50:50 with the water , to give a consistency similar to paint .
They concluded that , in 1993 , the technology would only be economic with power plants above 8 MW , and were planning at that point , to launch a product line .
At the time it was anticipated that the engines would come on market in the 2005 to 2010 time frame with an installed cost of $ 1300 / kW ( 1992 dollars ) ; an efficiency of 48.2 % ; NO2 emissions of 0.11 lb / MMbtu ; SO2 emissions of 0.37 lb / MMbtu ( equivalent to 0.3 % sulfur diesel oil ) ; and particulate emissions of 0.01 lb / MMbtu .
To reach this point it had been necessary for the manufacturers to solve the problems of the injectors ( while CB used ceramic , GE had moved to the use of diamond nozzles – a product increasingly now available ) ; hardening the piston rings , cylinder liners and valves ; and improving the emissions controls .
The increase in coal concentrations not only increased the economics , but since around 1 % of the coal is required to evaporate a 10 % water fraction in the mix , obviously the greater the mix , the better the engine performed .
For stationary engines it is more cost competitive to ship the coal dry , and then do the final preparation and water mixing at the engine site , saving the cost of the freight .
The paper was written in 1993 , and projected that the use of such an engine , today , would produce electricity at a cost of $ 0.0611 / kWh , against the cost of an oil / gas plant which was estimated to cost $ 0.0625 / kWh .
The oil / gas price was assumed to be $ 4.50 per MMbtu , coal price was anticipated to be $ 1.63 - $ 1.74 per MMbtu .
The entire economics , with those input prices , however was based on the assumption that the preparation costs for the coal slurry fuel would not bring the overall price above $ 3.00 per MMbtu .
The engine would require a higher maintenance cost $ 0.0036 / kWh as opposed to $ 0.0016 for conventional .
( More detailed costs are given in the paper ) .
Detroit Diesel focused more on large off highway haulage trucks and marine applications and had , by 1993 reached the point that they could achieve auto-ignition and get a combustion efficiency of around 99.2 % , the application required a higher rpm engine , and this , in turn , mandated a smaller droplet size ( 20 microns ) .
General Motors were oriented more toward locomotive manufacture , and looked at a variety of liquid fuel bases for the coal combination , however , it was the GE team , through their Transportation Systems division , that had the greatest success , with the program reaching the point that a fully modified 2500 hp locomotive was run , during November and December 1991 , around the GE test track , with equivalent power outputs to those of the conventional diesel oil powered plant .
Among the major accomplishments of this program were the development of specialized fuel injection equipment , for coal - water slurries , diamond compact inserts for the nozzle tips for wear resistance , and an integrated emissions control system .
Over 500 hours of engine operation was accumulated using coal fuel during the duration of this program A major milestone was attained when , during November and December 1991 , a coal - fueled diesel engine powered a locomotive on the General Electric test track .
. . . They estimated that the coal - water slurry would be about half the cost of diesel fuel , on an energy basis .
In 1993 the further drop in the price of oil , and the discontinuation of the programs at the Department of Energy brought all these programs to a conclusion , and interest faded .
However as the GE Review concluded
GE has developed the critical technologies in the completion of the second phase , electronically controlled fuel injection engine with all durable parts and a complete emissions clean - up system .
When the market environment again becomes favorable in the future , the technologies can be further improved and packaged into a commercial system very quickly .
. Well it would appear that we are now entering into those times , so it will be interesting to see how long it takes for this technology to be resurrected .
Some years ago I seem to remember seeing either on TV or on a news show at the cinema ( for this was in the UK ) the then Chairman of the National Coal Board driving around London in a car powered by this coal : water fuel .
Unfortunately my memory is not good enough to remember the source , and though the folks that now have custody of the NCB films have searched diligently they cannot find any reference , so if anyone else can remember I would like ( among other things for my own peace of mind ) to hear about it .
Thanks !
SAN FRANCISCO --
Google wrote grandly of the importance of Wi-Fi in its recent proposal for free wireless here , but the search company downplayed its own potential role in delivering Internet service .
The proposal , one of 26 responses from interested companies to the city 's request for information and comment on the idea of a citywide wireless Internet service , calls for Google to offer free Wi-Fi service to all residents and visitors .
Advertisements targeted to users ' locations would help support the project , in which other Internet service providers could also buy access wholesale and sell special services to end users , Google said .
" We believe that ubiquitous , affordable Internet access is a crucial aspect of humanitya ??s social and economic development , and that working to supply free Wi-Fi is a major step in that direction , " Google 's response said .
" However , we also believe that there will never be either one form of online connectivity or one company that exclusively provides it . "
Previous Efforts
Some recent news reports have raised the specter of Google muscling in on existing broadband providers through widespread free wireless Internet access , using optical fiber capacity to create a national backbone network .
In its proposal , Google referred to the fiber network , but in a more limited context .
" It takes thousands of computers and miles of fiber optic cable to globally deliver responses to your search queries within fractions of a second , " according to Google .
" We are confident that we can replicate the success of this infrastructure in the world of Wi-Fi for the city of San Francisco . "
San Francisco could be a test bed for location - based applications and services delivered over Wi -Fi , the company notes .
In fact , Google already is working with partners to provide free Wi-Fi in some parts of the city , and it offers access in a few locations near its Mountain View , California , headquarters .
Feeva , a software company in San Francisco that submitted its own response to the city 's request , said it joined with Google and the city in March to create two free municipal wireless networks .
Feeva 's software can identify the location of a user on a wireless network , the device being used for access , and preferences provided by the user , according to its submission .
By providing that data to advertisers -- while preserving the user 's anonymity -- the service provider can generate enough revenue to cover the cost of the network , according to Feeva .
Google 's Pitch
Google proposed to build an IEEE 802.11b/g Wi -Fi mesh network that delivers more than 1 megabit per second of capacity throughout the city .
Anyone in the city could get access free at speeds as high as 300 kilobits per second , and Google or third parties could sell access at higher speeds , possibly as high as 3 mbps .
The 300 kbps free service could be reached at street level , in the front room of a home or business , and on the first few floors of a building .
Consumers might be encouraged to use customer premises equipment for better indoor reception , Google said .
The city would give Google access to about 1900 lamp posts for placing access points , which would also be located on some buildings .
Google would also provide a separate virtual LAN for municipal agencies ' own traffic to help ensure delivery and mitigate congestion .
The city could use it free at 300 kbps .
Wireless Facilities , an engineering , network services , and technical outsourcing company in San Diego , would design and deploy the network , according to Google 's proposal .
The network would eventually support 802.11n , the future wireless LAN technology designed for more than 100 mbps throughput , once that is available , Google said .
Other Proposals
In October , San Francisco sought comments from the public as well as information from potential builders or operators of a service .
After responses came in early this month , Mayor Gavin Newsom said a committee would study the input for about three weeks and present its findings to him .
After that , the city will request actual plans and bids to provide a service .
The city could adopt one proposal or put together its own plan from parts of several proposals .
If the political process goes smoothly , a service could go live within five or six months , Newsom said .
Though Google 's plan has drawn the most attention , other plans were also posted .
EarthLink , which recently won the contract to provide Philadelphia 's municipal wireless network , proposed offering 1 mbps residential broadband for less than $ 20 per month , with subsidies for lower cost service to economically disadvantaged residents .
EarthLink would finance , own , deploy , and operate the network but also sell wholesale access to third - party providers .
MetroFi said it would build a Wi -Fi mesh network for a free , advertising - supported best - effort public service and a $ 19.95 per month , 1 mbps symmetric residential broadband service .
A pre-WiMax mesh network would provide service at up to 3 mbps to businesses .
Both networks would be built at no cost to the city .
Motorola would use Wi-Fi on unlicensed frequencies for consumer and public service access along with licensed frequencies for a public safety network that could be used in vehicles at more than 100 miles per hour .
ISPs could buy access wholesale and offer a variety of services on the public network .
SFLan , a nonprofit project of the Internet Archive that has been providing free Wi-Fi in the city since 1998 , proposed an " exchange " to connect many wireless ISPs and community organizations that provide service .
Solar - powered access points with wireless backbone connections would allow the citywide local network to keep working at a reduced capacity in case of disaster , SFLan said .
The city 's exchange network could be paid for by general funds or a bond issue .
It estimates an infrastructure covering 95 percent of the city would cost less than $ 1 million .
It opposes the use of captive portals for signing on to the network , because it envisions non-Web uses such as Voice over Internet Protocol ( VoIP ) and video cameras .
