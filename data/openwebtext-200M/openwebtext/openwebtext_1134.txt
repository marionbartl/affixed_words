I saw this a few weeks ago , and I knew I had to share it with you :
This is from Jessica Simpson ’s official Twitter account .
To quote the fabulous Michael K at Dlisted , this hurts my brain .
Some stars create ditzy personas for themselves , when in reality they are quite intelligent .
Take Dolly Parton .
I adore that woman !
She is feisty , daring and very intelligent , and on top of her giant bosom , tiny waist , bleached hair and pounds of makeup , she knows exactly what she ’s doing .
Jessica Simpson has always had a ditzy personality , and I have no doubt that she plays it up for the cameras on occasion .
However , unlike Dolly Parton , I do n’t think it ’s that much of a stretch !
What do you think ?

Palm Would n’t Violate Your Privacy , Would They ?
Yeah , they would .
In a big way .
This is something that most of us would probably expect from Apple , but Palm ?
Palm is supposed to be the anti-Apple ( though I ’m not sure what an apple ’s polar opposite would be ) .
They ’re the ones saving us loads of money with Sprint , offering a physical keyboard , bringing multitasking to the masses .
They ’re also the ones recording your GPS location once a day along with some other personal data .
The privacy breach was first discovered by Joey Hess , a Debian developer who had started to tinker with WebOS a while back .
When he noticed his Pre sending data to Palm on a daily basis he wondered , as most of us probably would , just what the phone was sending .
Without digging too deep , it turned out to be the following :
{ “ errorCode ” : 0 , “ timestamp ” : 1249855555954.000000 , “ latitude ” : 36.594108 , “ longitude ” : -82.183260 , “ horizAccuracy ” : 2523 , “ heading ” : 0 , “ velocity ” : 0 , “ altitude ” : 0 , “ vertAccuracy ” : 0 }
Yes , that is his global position at an accuracy similar to Google Maps .
The phone was also sending a list of every application Hess had used , along with usage duration for each app .
There were also the expected crashlogs and then a file containing every app
Hess used , regardless of whether they were Palm approved or not .
Obviously this has some pretty serious implications .
No one likes to know that this data is being collected , and while it ’s usually safer to assume that someone is gathering this stuff , the fact that Palm is doing it , after all their horn - blowing about the iPhone , is a tough pill to swallow .
Any company willing to do this sort of thing has to know it will be found out and cover its ass accordingly , right ?
Right .
Palm looks drum - tight in their privacy policy , which states this :
Location Based Services .
When you use location based services , we will collect , transmit , maintain , process , and use your location and usage data ( including both real time geographic information and information that can be used to approximate location ) in order to provide location based and related services , and to enhance your device experience .
On first read you might think , “ Gee , that once a day collection seems to fall well outside reasonable collection for Location Based Services . ”
You ’d be right , but it ’s the second half of the clause where they ’ve got you .
That part about enhancing your device experience pretty much has you nailed , unless of course you ’re able to prove that this collection is doing nothing of the sort .
I ’m pretty sure you wo n’t be able to pull that off .
Regardless of clever language , though , it does fall to Palm to alert the user that they are collecting this type of data .
That ’s why location based applications on smartphones typically ask the user ’s permission to access the phone ’s location .
Not doing so turns your data gathering into one thing : spying .
For Palm , it ’s spying on a massive scale .
Since the story broke a couple hours ago , Palm has issued the following statement :
Palm takes privacy very seriously , and offers users ways to turn data collecting services on and off .
Our privacy policy is like many policies in the industry and includes very detailed language about potential scenarios in which we might use a customer ’s information , all toward a goal of offering a great user experience .
For instance , when location based services are used , we collect their information to give them relevant local results in Google Maps .
We appreciate the trust that users give us with their information , and have no intention to violate that trust .
Odd .
I thought collecting that sort of data without letting your customers know was , by definition , a violation of trust .
It also seems incredibly convenient to neglect to mention just where your customers can turn off those data collection services .
For a full list of the data Palm is getting from your phone , head to Hess ’s website .

It seems that the Walter Block quote on sexual harassment I posted a while back has been rediscovered by various libertarians online and lots of criticism , analysis and defenses ( of PP not Block ) have been written about it .
It appears as even Walter Block himself appeared on the scene to distance himself from his own words .
However , the issue here is not as simple as merely saying that Block made a flawed logical reasoning , or that it was all a mistake or anything as simple as that .
The quote above is simply a pointed example of the intellectual dead - end one reaches when his whole ethical framework resolves around respect for Private Property and fetishism of voluntarism .
The issue here is that what Block wrote , unfortunately is a logical conclusion of suggesting voluntarism and the non-aggression principle within a propertarian environment as the core of ethics .
It is , unfortunately consistent with “ Anarcho ” - Capitalist principles .
Most defenses of Private property I ’ve seen ( for an example , see the No Third Solution argument ) orbit around the concept that harassment is prevented by the Non-Aggression principle and the lack of an explicit contract to allow it to happen .
In short they consider the problem to be simply one of a contractual nature .
They miss the elephant in the room by looking at the murals .
You see , there ’s basically two arguments put forth here .
So lets look at them in turn
“ The Problem is not that the boss is harassing the secretary , but that he is harassing her without having an explicit clause in their employment contract allowing him to do so . ”
This argument in short suggests that there is nothing wrong with a boss who only hires secretaries as a personal semi-harem , as long as he makes that known from the start .
It assumes then that any secretary which agrees to this contract cannot then consider the sexual advances she agreed to , to be harassment .
This argument , while on the surface seems legit , is not in fact any more different than Block ’s .
It simply moves the agreement of the secretary from the implicit to the explicit .
Whereas block asserted that the secretary ’s continuous acceptance of the sexual harassment ( i.e. not quitting her job over it ) was an implicit agreement to it and thus not “ harassment ” , the contractual argument simply desires to take the same exact situation and legitimize it via the legal stamp .
However this argument misses the point that in both cases , the implicit or explicit acceptance of the harassment from the secretary is not caused because she wants it but because of the lack of alternatives .
Because the other choices that remain to her if she does not accept the harassment or sign the contract are worse ( ex starvation of her and her family . )
The same secretary which “ volunteered ” to be harassed without a contract in Block ’s example will also “ volunteer ” to sign the contract .
Does the nature of her harassment change because she signed a piece of paper ?
Does the moral condemnation the boss deserves for abusing his position disappear ?
Of course not , because the moral condemnation does not spring from the “ aggression ” the boss performs against the secretary but from the fact that he is using his position of power , which stems from inequality of wealth , to passively coerce the secretary to accept behaviour she would not otherwise accept if she was on equal standing .
The second problem which logically follows from the propertarian system is this :
“ The boss can initiate a sexual advance towards the secretary who is at all liberty to refuse .
However the boss then is at all liberty to fire her and there is nothing at all wrong with this . ”
I believe that this is even more tricky for propertarians to defend .
If we assume that the boss would not go straight to pinching ( which the right - “ libertarians ” can then jump to label as “ aggression ” ) but would initially “ test the waters ” so to speak by starting with subtle advancement and then growing bolder the more such advancements are accepted we end up exactly in the original Blockean argument once more .
Let ’s say that this Boss does a subtle sexual advancement which the Secretary refuses .
The Boss then fires her ( terminating their “ voluntary contract ” ) .
Next secretary ?
Same thing .
And so on until he finds one secretary which is in a desperate enough situation that she tolerates his initial advances .
He then becomes bolder and bolder until we reach the phase of pinching .
Can we call that “ aggression ” ?
No since the secretary did not show outright refusal to such an advance and for the boss it can look like a normal progression of human relationship ( or some other similar phrasing of his excuse ) .
After all , the secretary is free at any point to make it clear that she does not appreciate his advances … and get fired .
In fact , the prudent “ libertarian ” boss , would not offer a sexual contract upfront to his potential secretaries but would rather follow the above actions until he ’s determined that she ’s desperate enough , and before moving on to actual physical contact , he would simply request that his secretary sign a new job contract volunteering to his sexual advances so as to legally cover his arse … just in case , you know .
Is there any way for Voluntarism and the NAP to morally condemn the actions of the boss ?
I fear not .
And this again points out the intellectual bankruptcy of this ideology which cannot be covered by shallow “ I was wrong to say that ” excuses .
The problem is that Block was not inconsistent with his ideology .
He simply took it to his natural conclusion as he ’s done with his acceptance of slave contracts .
It just so happened that his argument struck a chord in the feminist movement who saw through the bankruptcy of voluntarism and forced him to backtrack hurriedly , even if he ca n’t explain the reasoning behind this .
Unlike vulgar - libertarians , a boss firing a secretary because she would not accept such a debasement is immediately a cause for moral condemnation by egalitarians as we condemn all situations which passively coerce people to “ volunteer ” to such humiliation .
It is the same reason why we condemn wage - slavery just as much as we condemn sexual harassment .
The only difference between those two is that the latter has been taken out of the status of “ normal ” by the brave actions of the feminist movement while the former is still seen as something natural .
But the underlying causes for one to “ volunteer ” to sexual harassment are exactly the same as what causes one to “ volunteer ” to wage slavery : Private Property .

Scientists at the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease ( GICD ) have traced the evolution of the four - chambered human heart to a common genetic factor linked to the development of hearts in turtles and other reptiles .
" This is the first genetic link to the evolution of two , rather than one , pumping chamber in the heart , which is a key event in the evolution of becoming warm - blooded , " said Gladstone investigator Benoit Bruneau , PhD , who led the study .
" The gene involved , Tbx5 , is also implicated in human congenital heart disease , so our results also bring insight into human disease . "

Top Chef Quickfire challenge .
It 's time to start
Hypercooking is defined by The Food Section as " an environmentally conscious way of cooking that seeks to maximize the impact of the energy used during the cooking process . "
Hypercooking is the kitchen version of hypermiling , in which drivers change they way they drive and use specific techniques to go as far as possible on a gallon of gas .
In the Big Green Cookbook Jackie Newgent offers hypercooking tips and recipes , such as one for cookies that finish baking in the residual heat of the oven .
Try these tips , after the jump , to save energy and maximize every last bit of energy you use .
Skip Preheating
OK , maybe not with a cake or a soufflé , but other dishes such as casseroles or baked pastas will be fine starting out in a cold oven .
Think of all the energy you 're missing out on every time you let your oven preheat with nothing in it .
Turn the Oven Off Before the Dish Is Done
It takes a long time for an oven to cool down .
Take advantage of that residual heat by letting your dish finish cooking in it .
Green - Grill It
Same idea as above .
Turn the grill off and let those veggies finish cooking over the dying flames .
Do n't Use an Oven
Instead of an oven or other large appliance , use a smaller , more efficient toaster oven , pressure cooker , slow cooker or rice cooker .
Hey , it worked for Evan Kleiman .
Get Creative
Take advantage of the hot steam coming off a pot of boiling water for pasta .
Put a glass bowl with your sauce ingredients over the pot , as the pasta cooks , the ingredients will warm up and melt .
Instead of dumping that boiling water pasta water down the drain , use it to heat your serving bowl .
Turn Things Off
When you 're done cooking and eating , make sure you 're still not using energy .
Corral small appliances like the toaster , coffee grinder , and phone charger all onto one power strip .
This will allow you to cut down on vampire power .
Electronics that are plugged in , even if they are off , still suck power from the electric grid .
Just flip one button off when you leave and you will have cut off the flow to all of your hungry units .

Having gained fame in the late ' 60s by building a Defense Department network that would become the Internet , BBN Technologies today is being acquired by one of the nation 's leading defense contractors .
Raytheon announced this morning that is buying the venerable BBN for an undisclosed sum .
From Raytheon 's press release :
BBN 's diverse portfolio encompasses a range of technologies including advanced networking , speech and language technologies , information technologies , sensor systems , and cybersecurity .
The company 's deep scientific and engineering talent aligns well with Raytheon 's expertise and commitment to excellence .
" BBN brings world class people , technologies and capabilities to Raytheon and our customers , " said William H. Swanson , Chairman and Chief Executive Officer , Raytheon Company .
" We expect all of our businesses to benefit from the application of BBN 's research and development expertise and technologies across our product lines and programs .
BBN 's rich technology heritage makes this a natural fit . "
As BBN notes on its homepage : " BBN Technologies built the ARPANET in 1969 , and members of our Internetwork Research group have over two centuries of aggregate experience in data networking research . "
BBN has done plenty of military research work for DARPA in the 40 years since then .
Among the company 's current projects are :
Flexible Intra-autonomous - system Routing Environment ( FIRE ) : A project in DARPA 's Active Nets Program , FIRE security enables flow - specific routing algorithms and / or metrics within an autonomous system .
Smart Environment for Network Control , Monitoring , & Management ( SENCOMM ) : Another project with DARPA 's Active Nets Program , SENCOMM extends BBNT 's work on Smart Packets ( packets carrying executable code ) to enable intelligent network performance management tools .
Density - and Asymmetry - aware wireless Networking ( DAWN ) : A project in DARPA 's Global Mobile Information Systems Program ( GloMo ) , DAWN addresses the problems of routing in the presence of varying node density and asymmetric links in mobile ad hoc networks .
And here 's another one just reported by my Network World colleague Michael Cooney on his Layer8 blog .
History buffs will tell you that BBN is also known for having conducted acoustical analysis in 1978 for the House Select Committee charged with investigating the assassination of President John F. Kennedy 15 years earlier .
( Update : Did BBN cover up JFK evidence ?
A former employee bristles at the suggestion . )
The component realization resides in the package : [...].business.orderprocessor .
It is deployed as a WAR .
The business is the name of the layer / tier and the orderprocessor the component 's realization .
Why this packages ?
It is easier to manage dependencies between them during the continuus integration .
The component " orderprocessor " is organized internally in three , technical layers - also realized as packages :
boundary : the external visible contract , the actual facade
: the external visible contract , the actual facade control : the actual business logic implementation
: the actual business logic implementation entity : the persistence
Each package represents a responsibility and helps you also to measure the dependencies inside the component .
E.g. elements from the entity package should not access the control or boundary .
The boundary is implemented as a no-interface view @ Stateless EJB 3.1 :
@ Path ( " / orders / " ) @ Interceptors ( CallAudit.class ) @ Stateless public class OrderService { @EJB BillingService billing ; @EJB Delivery Service delivery ; @EJB Warehouse warehouse ; @PUT @ Produces ( {" application /xml " , " application / json " } ) @ Consumes ( {" application /xml " , " application / json " } ) public Order order ( Order newOrder ) { Order order = warehouse.checkout(newOrder ) ; billing.payForOrder( order ) ; delivery.deliver ( order ) ; return order ; } @GET @ Path ( " {orderid} / " ) @ Produces ( {" application /xml " , " application / json " } ) public Order status ( @PathParam ( " orderid " ) long orderId ) { return delivery.status( orderId ) ; } }
The functionality is directly exposed via REST , so there is no need to introduce dedicated interfaces .
The OrderService starts transactions , can be decorated with cross-cutting aspects and represents the single entry point .
Its a facade .
An element from the control layer simply relies on the existence of transactions - it is always executed in the boundary context .
@ Stateless public class DeliveryService { @ PersistenceContext EntityManager em ; public void deliver ( Order order ) { System.out.println ( " Delivered : " + order ) ; order.setDelivered ( true ) ; } public Order status ( long orderId ) { Order found = this.em.find ( Order.class , orderId ) ; if ( found == null ) found = new Order ( ) ; return found ; } }
@ Entity @ Table ( name = " T_ORDER " ) @ XmlRootElement @XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD ) public class Order { @ Id @ GeneratedValue ( strategy = GenerationType.AUTO )
@XmlElement private long id ; @XmlElement private int amount ; @XmlElement private int product
Id ; @XmlElement private boolean delivered ; public Order ( ) { } public Order ( int amount , int product Id ) { this .
amount = amount ; this .
product
Id = productId ; } public boolean isDelivered ( ) { return delivered ; } public void setDelivered ( boolean delivered ) { this .
delivered = delivered ; } }
The Order entity is also annotated with JAXB - annotations - what allows its serialization via XML or JSON without any additional work .
In real world you will probably have to introduce a DTO to separate the different aspects of DB and XML serialization .
EJB 3.1 and JSR - 311 ( REST ) fit perfectly together .
You can expose EJB 3.1 directly as REST - facades and gain single - threaded programming model , transactionality etc .
The dependency to the EJB 3.1 API is very low ( two annotations ) - you could even go without any annotation .
The JUnit - tests are simple as well :
[...] import org.junit.
Before ; import org.junit.
Test ; import static org.junit.
Assert.* ; import static org.mockito.Mockito .*;
public class OrderServiceTest { private OrderService orderService ; @ Before public void initOrderService ( ) { this.orderService = new OrderService ( ) ; this.orderService.billing = new BillingService ( ) ; this.orderService.delivery = new DeliveryService ( ) ; this.orderService.warehouse = mock ( Warehouse.class ) ; } @ Test public void testOrder ( ) { Order order = new Order ( 2 , 1 ) ; when ( this.orderService.warehouse.checkout( order ) ) .thenReturn( order ) ; Order ordered = this.orderService.order(order ) ; assertNotNull ( ordered ) ; assertTrue(ordered.isDelivered ( ) ) ; } }
The whole sample ( LeanServiceECBComponent ) , tested with Netbeans 6.7.1/6.8m1 and Glassfishv3 , was pushed into : http://kenai.com/projects/javaee-patterns/
After opening the LeanServiceECBComponent in Netbeans6.8 ( m1 ) , right mouse - click on the project and choose " Test RESTFul Web Services " .
This component is also described in the current JavaMagazin issue in more detail .

A federal judge has delayed making a decision until next month on whether to ban Tempe - based LifeLock Inc. from setting fraud alerts for consumers with the three credit bureaus .
Judge Andrew Guilford in a court filing Wednesday cited new facts regarding LifeLock 's arrangement with credit bureau TransUnion for the delay .
LifeLock , which claims 1.5 million customers , charges $ 10 per month for identity protection services that include setting free fraud alerts every 90 days with TransUnion and competing credit bureaus , Experian and Equifax .
It has a parternership with TransUnion to streamline the process .
The fraud alerts practice spurred a lawsuit Experian filed against LifeLock in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California in 2008 claiming it has been harmed by the Tempe company 's actions .
Guilford already ruled the practice violates California 's Unfair Competition Law and goes against a public policy established by the Fair Credit Reporting
Act that says only consumers , not third - party companies such as LifeLock , have the right to set the alerts .
He was expected to rule this week on a motion for a permanent injunction Experian filed against LifeLock .
Instead , Guilford wrote he was inclined to issue an injunction but wanted more time to address new information about LifeLock 's relationship with TransUnion .
He set a hearing for Oct. 5 .
LifeLock this week said it plans to roll out a new ID protection product in the coming weeks to replace its fraud - alerts .
It has argued that an injunction banning third - party firms from setting alerts would harm consumers by limiting their ability to protect themselves .
" However , we will abide by the judge 's order and have already taken steps in light of his recent ruling to announce the implementation of our new identity protection system , " Clarissa Cerda , general counsel for LifeLock , said in a statement .
Under the Fair Credit Reporting
Act , consumers can set the alerts for free by contacting the credit bureaus .
An unfortunate milestone in the war in Afghanistan was reported this week : private contractors have outnumbered U.S. troops in Afghanistan since March .
Contractors now make up " 57 percent of the Pentagon 's Afghanistan personnel . "
The highest ratio of contractors to military personnel recorded in any war in the history of the United States now exists in Afghanistan , according to a recently released report by a Congressional research group .
Of particular importance , the report concludes that " abuses and crimes committed by armed private security contractors and interrogators against local nationals may have undermined US efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan . "
That 's not surprising .
Every day another news link detailing some abuse , mistreatment , violence , neglect , or crime committed by private contractors enters my inbox .
If it is n't the CIA that 's in the news for something criminal , it 's a private contractor instead .
This week Americans were treated to i mages of private security guards from ArmorGroup at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul " participating in naked pool parties and sex acts to gain promotions or assignment to preferable shifts . "
ABC News reported that top supervisors at ArmorGroup ( whose corporate parent is Wackenhut ) were not only aware of the " deviant sexual acts . "
They helped to organize them .
A segment on Rachel Maddow September 3rd explored the issue of abuses and misconduct committed by private contractors while also exploring how difficult it is to hold private contractors accountable .
MADDOW : We got 2007 investigation by the State Department .
We 've got a follow - up investigation by the Senate .
We 've got in the midst of all of this , a re-upping of the contracts for these guys .
What 's your take on how the State Department now is handling this ?
Obviously , the track record was bad .
The contract was re-upped this past summer .
But what do you think about the way they 've responded to you now and what they 're doing in terms of taking remedial action ?
BRIAN : Well , I was happy to just get a call about an hour or two ago from the State Department that actually , the number three at the embassy is asked to come over to be briefed by us at POGO next week .
So , that 's a good sign .
What worries me , though , is I 've had an e-mail that was circulated to all the guards that told them that while State Department investigators are there , interviewing all the people at the base , they are not aloud to speak to State Department investigator without a supervisor being there with them ... ... MADDOW : Is it harder to pursue accountability generally when government functions are contracted out to private companies ?
Does that create another layer of insulation for people who act criminally or inappropriately or wastefully on the taxpayers ' dime ?

Summary
So much for a slow news month .
August feels like campaign season , with claims on health care coming at us daily .
Does the House bill call for mandatory counseling on how to end seniors ’ lives sooner ?
Absolutely not .
Will the government be dictating to doctors how to treat their patients ?
No .
Do the bills propose cutting Medicare benefit levels ?
No on that one , too .
But on the other hand , has Congress figured out how to pay for this overhaul ?
Not yet .
Or will it really save families $ 2,500 a year as the president keeps claiming ?
Good luck on that one , too .
In this article we offer a run-down of seven falsehoods we ’ve taken on recently , with some additional updating and research thrown in .
Analysis
False : Government Will Decide What Care I Get ( a.k.a. they wo n’t give grandma a hip replacement )
This untrue claim has its roots in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( the stimulus bill ) , which called for the creation of a Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research .
The council is charged with supporting and coordinating research that the government has been funding for years into which treatments work best , and in some cases , are most cost - effective .
Supporters of this type of research say it can provide valuable information to doctors , improving care and also lowering cost .
Betsy McCaughey , a former Republican lieutenant governor of New York ( and now a professing Democrat ) , wrote in an opinion piece that the government would actually tell doctors what procedures they could and could n’t perform .
The claim took off from there , popping up in chain e-mails and Republican press conferences .
It ’s not true .
The legislation specifically says that the council can’t issue requirements or guidelines on treatment or insurance benefits :
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 : Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the Council to mandate coverage , reimbursement , or other policies for any public or private payer .
…
None of the reports submitted under this section or recommendations made by the Council shall be construed as mandates or clinical guidelines for payment , coverage , or treatment .
As for the health care bills themselves , the House ’s H.R. 3200 sets up a center to conduct and gather such research within the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , an entity the CBO called “ the most prominent federal agency supporting various types of research on the comparative effectiveness of medical treatments . ”
Like the stimulus legislation , the bill states that : “ Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the Commission or the Center to mandate coverage , reimbursement , or other policies for any public or private payer . ’’
The Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee bill ( not yet released in its entirety ) calls for a similar center that “ will promote health outcomes research and evaluation that enables patients and providers to identify which therapies work best for most people and to effectively identify where more personalized approaches to care are necessary for others , ” according to the summary of the bill .
This claim also stems from a fear that the U.S. will institute a system like that of the U.K. , where the government provides and pays for health care .
But none of the bills now being debated in Congress call for such a system , and the president has said he does n’t want nationalized or single - payer health care , as we ’ve said several times .

“ Government - Run Health Care ? ” April 30
False : The Bill Is Paid For
At least , it is n’t paid for yet .
President Obama has repeatedly said that a health care overhaul “ will be paid for ” and that he wo n’t sign a bill that is n’t deficit - neutral .
But neither the House bill nor the Senate HELP Committee bill meets that criteria .
According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation , the House bill as introduced would add a net $ 239 billion over 10 years to the deficit , while the HELP Committee bill racks up more , $ 597 billion over 10 years .
Obama has also said he has “ identified two - thirds of those costs to be paid for by tax dollars that are already being spent right now . ”
But “ identified ” is the operative word .
These savings are estimates and whether around $ 650 billion ( about two - thirds of the cost of health care over 10 years ) can be saved remains to be seen .
Most of the money would come from Medicare , but cuts in payments to insurers and practitioners are n’t popular measures that move easily through Congress .
So the big questions remain .
Will the president break his promise and sign a bill that piles up hundreds of billions of additional debt ?
Will the legislation have to be scaled back to cost less , and perhaps cover fewer of the uninsured ?
Who will pay additional taxes ?
Can pain - free reductions in other government programs be found ?
“ Obama ’s Health Care News Conference , ” July 23
False : Private Insurance Will Be Illegal
In July , Investor ’s Business Daily published an editorial in which it claimed that H.R. 3200 would make private insurance illegal .
But IBD was mistaken .
It was citing the part of the bill that ensures people with individually purchased coverage do n’t have to give up that coverage unless they want to .
Under the House bill , people who want to buy new individual , nongroup coverage will have to purchase it through a new health insurance exchange .
They can still buy private insurance – the exchange , in fact , would offer a range of private plans , in addition to a new federal health insurance option .
However , those who were already buying their own insurance before the bill went into effect – about 14 million Americans – will have their plans grandfathered in .
The part of the bill IBD cites does n’t forbid insurers from issuing new plans .
It says that new individual plans will not be considered grandfathered , and will have to be purchased through the exchange .
“ Private Insurance Not Outlawed ” Aug. 13
False : The House Bill Requires Suicide Counseling
This claim is nonsense .
In an appearance on former Sen . Fred Thompson ’s radio show , McCaughey also enthusiastically pushed the bogus claim that the House bill will require seniors to have regular counseling sessions on how to end their lives :
McCaughey , July 16 : The Congress would make it mandatory … that every five years , people in Medicare have a required counseling session that will tell them how to end their life sooner , how to decline nutrition , how to decline being hydrated , how to go into hospice care … all to do what ’s in society ’s best interest … and cut your life short .
This is a misrepresentation .
What the bill actually provides for is voluntary Medicare - funded end - of - life counseling .
In other words , if seniors choose to make advance decisions about the type of care and treatments they wish to receive at the end of their lives , Medicare will pay for them to sit down with their doctor and discuss their preferences .
There is no requirement to attend regular sessions , and there is absolutely no provision encouraging euthanasia .
Of course , seniors who talk to their doctors about end - of - life care might well choose to discuss what types of life - saving treatment they wish to refuse .
That choice has been federally guaranteed for almost 20 years .
Doctor - assisted suicide , on the other hand , is legal in only three states , making it even more unlikely to be a major part of the federal health plan .
Clarification , Aug. 18 : We initially wrote that “ euthanasia ” was legal in three states .
That term is often used to refer to “ doctor - assisted suicide , ” but it has much broader implications than that .
We ’ve modified the sentence above accordingly .
“ False Euthanasia Claims , ” July 29
False : Families Will Save $ 2,500
Proponents speak constantly of holding down rising medical costs .
As recently as May 13 , the president said legislation plus some voluntary measures by the private sector “ could save families $ 2,500 in the coming years – $ 2,500 per family , ” echoing a claim he made countless times on the campaign trail last year .
Do n’t start spending that $ 2,500 just yet .
For one thing , Obama is n’t actually promising to reduce health care spending below current levels , only to cut the rate of growth in spending .
And even that is proving to be far tougher to accomplish than Obama led voters to believe .
We ’ve already mentioned that the Congressional Budget Office says “ savings ” in Medicare spending resulting from the House bill would fall short of what is needed to pay for two - thirds of its cost , which is Obama ’s goal .
And those savings come only in what the government pays , not in what families pay .
Squeezing more savings , even from Medicare , is proving difficult .
On July 17 , Obama ’s lead man on the subject , Office of Management and Budget Director Peter Orszag , wrote to congressional leaders seeking legislation setting up an independent agency , the Independent Medicare Advisory Council ( IMAC ) .
It would be made up of health care experts with the power to make a package of annual changes in the amounts Medicare would pay to doctors .
The president must either approve or diapprove the entire package as offered ; if he approves , it goes into effect unless Congess passes a joint resolution stopping it .
But when CBO took a look , it estimated that the new agency would save a total of only $ 2 billion over the next decade .
As for saving $ 2,500 for families , as opposed to saving money for the government , the CBO ’s letter , signed by Director Douglas W. Elmendorf , said :
CBO : [ E ] xperts generally agree that changes in government policy have the potential to significantly reduce health care spending — for the nation as a whole and for the federal government in particular — without harming people ’s health .
However , achieving large reductions in projected spending would require fundamental changes in the financing and delivery of health care .
As an example of the “ fundamental ” changes that might do the trick : CBO suggested moving away from the current system of paying doctors and hospitals for performing medical procedures and paying them instead a fixed fee per patient or some other payment based on “ value . ”
Another CBO suggestion : “ higher cost - sharing requirements . ”
So far we do n’t see those ideas in the bills being considered .
False : Medicare Benefits Will Be Slashed
The claim that Obama and Congress are cutting seniors ’
Medicare benefits to pay for the health care overhaul is outright false , though that does n’t keep it from being repeated ad infinitum .
The truth is that the pending House bill extracts $ 500 billion from projected Medicare spending over 10 years , as scored by the Congressional Budget Office , by doing such things as trimming projected increases in the program ’s payments for medical services , not including physicians .
Increases in other areas , such as payments to doctors , bring the net savings down to less than half that amount .
But none of the predicted savings – or cuts , depending on one ’s perspective – come from reducing current or future benefits for seniors .
The president has promised repeatedly that benefit levels wo n’t be reduced , reiterating the point recently in Portsmouth , N.H. :
Obama , Aug. 11 : Another myth that we ’ve been hearing about is this notion that somehow we ’re going to be cutting your Medicare benefits .
We are not .
Is he wrong ?
Not according to AARP , by far the nation ’s largest organization representing the over - 50 population .
In a “ Myths vs. Facts ” rundown , AARP says :
AARP : Fact : None of the health care reform proposals being considered by Congress would cut Medicare benefits or increase your out - of - pocket costs for Medicare services .
To be sure , Obama has n’t always thought that Medicare “ savings ” could be accomplished without actual cuts in benefits .
Last fall , his campaign ran two television ads accusing Sen .
John McCain of wanting “ a 22 percent cut in [ Medicare ] benefits . ”
The basis for the ads was a newspaper article in which a McCain aide said the Arizona Republican would cut Medicare costs .
But the aide said nothing about cutting benefits , in fact quite the contrary .
We called the claim “ false ” when Obama made it against McCain , and it ’s still false now when Obama ’s critics are making the same accusation against him .
False : Illegal Immigrants Will Be Covered
One Republican congressman issued a press release claiming that “ 5,600,000 Illegal Aliens May Be Covered Under Obamacare , ” and we ’ve been peppered with queries about similar claims .
They ’re not true .
In fact , the House bill ( the only bill to be formally introduced in its entirety ) specifically says that no federal money would be spent on giving illegal immigrants health coverage :
H.R. 3200 : Sec 246 — NO FEDERAL PAYMENT FOR UNDOCUMENTED ALIENS
Nothing in this subtitle shall allow Federal payments for affordability credits on behalf of individuals who are not lawfully present in the United States .
Also , under current law , those in the country illegally do n’t qualify for federal health programs .
Of interest : About half of illegal immigrants have health insurance now , according to the nonpartisan Pew Hispanic Center , which says those who lack insurance do so principally because their employers do n’t offer it .

By Trent Brown
September 22 , 2009 -- Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal -- Antonio Gramsci is an important figure in the history of Marxist theory .
While Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels provided a rigorous analysis of capital at the social and economic levels – particularly showing how capital antagonises the working class and gives rise to crisis – Gramsci supplemented this with a sophisticated theory of the political realm and how it is organically / dialectically related to social and economic conditions .
He provides us with a theory of how the proletariat must organise politically if it is to effectively respond to capital ’s crises and failures , and bring about revolutionary change .
Incidentally , this innovation has proven to be of interest not only to Marxists , but also to those involved in other forms of progressive politics , from the civil rights movement , to gender politics , to contemporary ecological struggles .
The reason why his approach has proven so popular and generally adaptable is because Gramsci was himself a man of action and his fundamental concern was with progressive strategy .
Thus while in this article I plan to give a give a general outline of Gramsci ’s theory of hegemony and the reasons behind its formulation , it ’s important that we build on this by thinking about how we can use these concepts strategically in our own struggles .
What is hegemony ?
It would seem appropriate to begin this discussion by asking ``What is hegemony ? ’’
It turns out to be a difficult question to answer when we are talking about Gramsci , because , at least within The Prison Notebooks , he never gives a precise definition of the term .
This is probably the main reason why there is so much inconsistency in the literature on hegemony – people tend to form their own definition , based on their own reading of Gramsci and other sources .
The problem with this is that if people ’s reading of Gramsci is partial then so too is their definition .
For example , Martin Clark ( 1977 , p. 2 ) has defined hegemony as ``how the ruling classes control the media and education ’’ .
While this definition is probably more narrow than usual , it does reflect a common misreading of the concept , namely that hegemony is the way the ruling class controls the institutions that control or influence our thought .
Most of the academic and activist literature on hegemony , however , takes a slightly broader view than this , acknowledging more institutions than these being involved in the exercise of hegemony – at least including also the military and the political system .
The problem is that even when these institutions are taken into account , the focus tends to be exclusively on the ruling class , and methods of control .
Hegemony is frequently used to describe the way the capitalist classes infiltrate people ’s minds and exert their domination .
What this definition misses is the fact that Gramsci not only used the term ``hegemony ’’ to describe the activities of the ruling class , he also used it to describe the influence exerted by progressive forces .
Keeping this in mind , we can see that hegemony should be defined not only as something the ruling class does , it is in fact the process by which social groups – be they progressive , regressive , reformist , etc. – come to gain the power to lead , how they expand their power and maintain it .
To understand what Gramsci was trying to achieve through developing his theory of hegemony , it is useful to look at the historical context that he was responding to as well as the debates in the movement at the time .
The term ``hegemony ’’ had been in general use in socialist circles since the early 20th century .
Its use suggests that if a group was described as ``hegemonic ’’ then it occupied a leadership position within a particular political sphere ( Boothman , 2008 ) .
Lenin ’s use of the term gegemoniya ( the Russian equivalent of hegemony , often translated as ``vanguard ’’ ) , however , seemed to imply a process more akin to what Gramsci would describe .
During his attempts to catalyse the Russian Revolution Lenin ( 1902/1963 ) made the observation that when left to their own devices , workers tended to reach only a trade union consciousness , fighting for better conditions within the existing system .
To bring about revolutionary change , he argued that the Bolsheviks needed to come to occupy a hegemonic position within the struggle against the tsarist regime .
This meant not only empowering the various unions by bringing them together , but also involving all of society ’s ``opposition strata ’’ in the movement , drawing out the connections between all forms of ``political oppression and autocratic arbitrariness ’’ ( Lenin , 1963 , pp. 86-87 ) .
In the post - revolutionary period , however , the implication changed .
Lenin argued that it was crucial to the establishment of the ``hegemony of the proletariat ’’ that ( a ) the urban proletariat retain an ongoing alliance with the rural peasants ( who made up the majority of Russia ’s population ) in order to retain national leadership and ( b ) that the expertise of the former capitalists be utilised , by forcing them to effectively manage state industries .
These dual processes of leadership via consent and the command of force in the development of hegemony would play a crucial role in Gramsci ’s theory .
Gramsci had been in Russia from 1922 - 23 while these debates were raging and it was after this time that we see hegemony begin to take a central role in his writings .
Italy
As much as he was influenced by what was going on in Russia , Gramsci was also influenced by his own political experiences .
Gramsci had been heavily involved in the struggle against capitalism and fascism in Italy and for a while served as the leader of the Communist Party of Italy .
In the period following the World War I , there had been a lot of optimism in Europe , and Italy in particular , that now that people had seen the atrocities that the ruling classes could unleash and the alternative that was developing in Russia , some kind of workers ’ revolution in Europe was imminent .
Gramsci certainly shared this optimism .
Events that took place in the early 1920s seemed to confirm this .
Tensions at all strata of society were high , there were mass agitations and people were forming factory councils and workers co-operatives .
But despite the intensity of the mobilisations , it fizzled out remarkably quickly .
Unions were co-opted , workers ’ co-ops became marginal and uncompetitive .
Common people were intimidated by elites or otherwise captivated by the allure of fascist rhetoric .
Gramsci and others formed the Italian Communist Party to try to reinvigorate the movement , but it was evident that people were too disillusioned by the failures of the previous years to really become involved .
Votes for the Communist Party were disappointingly low .
When Gramsci was arrested in 1926 as a part of Mussolini ’s emergency measures , he found himself in prison with a lot of time to reflect on what had happened and where things went wrong .
How was it that the ruling class had been able to so effectively stifle the potential of the movement , and what would be required for the progressive forces to mobilise the masses in a way that would enable them to bring about a fundamental change in society ?
These questions would of course be central to Gramsci ’s theory of hegemony .
Stages
As suggested above , in The Prison Notebooks Gramsci refers to hegemony to describe activities of both currently dominant groups as well as the progressive forces .
For Gramsci , whatever the social group is , we can see that there are certain common stages of development that they must go through before they can become hegemonic .
Drawing on Marx , the first requirement is economic : that the material forces be sufficiently developed that people are capable of solving the most pressing social problems .
Gramsci then goes on to state that there are three levels of political development that a social group must pass through in order to develop the movement that will allow change to be initiated .
The first of these stages is referred to as ``economic - corporate ’’ .
The corporatist is what we might understand as the self - interested individual .
People become affiliated at the economic - corporate stage as a function of this self - interest , recognising that they need the support of others to retain their own security .
Trade unionism is probably the clearest example of this , at least in the case of people joining a union for fear of pay cuts , retrenchment etc .
One can also speak of short - term co-operation between otherwise competing capitalists in these terms .
The point to emphasise is that at this stage of a group ’s historical development there is no real sense of solidarity between members .
In the second stage , group members become aware that there is a wider field of interests and that there are others who share certain interests with them and will continue to share those interests into the foreseeable future .
It is at this stage that a sense of solidarity develops , but this solidarity is still only on the basis of shared economic interests .
There is no common worldview or anything of that nature .
This kind of solidarity can lead to attempts to promote legal reform to improve the group ’s position within the current system , but consciousness of how they , and others , might benefit through the creation of a new system is lacking .
It is only by passing through the third stage that hegemony really becomes possible .
In this stage , the social group members becomes aware that their interests need to be extended beyond what they can do within the context of their own particular class .
What is required is that their interests are taken up by other subordinate groups as their own .
This was what Lenin and the Bolsheviks were thinking in forming an alliance with the peasants – that it was only through making the Bolshevik revolution also a peasants ’ revolution , which peasants could see as being their own , that the urban proletariat could maintain its leading position .
Gramsci reckoned that in the historical context that he was working in , the passage of a social group from self - interested reformism to national hegemony could occur most effectively via the political party .
In this complex formulation , the different ideologies of allied groups come together .
There will inevitably be conflict between these ideologies , and through a process of debate and struggle , one ideology , or a unified combination thereof , will emerge representing the allied classes .
This ideology can be said to be hegemonic , the group that it represents has acquired a hegemonic position over the subordinate groups .
At this stage , the party has reached maturity , having a unity of both economic and political goals as well as a moral and intellectual unity – one might say a shared worldview .
With this unity behind it , the party sets about transforming society in order to lay the conditions for the expansion of the hegemonic group .
The state becomes the mechanism by which this is done : policies are enacted and enforced that allow the hegemonic group to more effectively achieve its goals and to create symmetry between its goals and those of other groups .
Although these goals are formulated with the interests of a single group in mind , they need to be experienced by the populace as being in the interests of everybody .
In order for this to be effective , the hegemonic group must have some form of engagement with the interests of the subordinate classes .
The dominant interests cannot be simplistically imposed upon them .
Progressive hegemony
While Gramsci considers these pragmatic moves as being requirements for any group to come to power , he also has a very deep ethical concern for the way in which the process occurs .
In this sense , we can detect in Gramsci ’s work a qualitative difference between the operations of hegemony by regressive , authoritarian groups on the one hand , and progressive social groups on the other .
At an ethical level , Gramsci was above all else an anti-dogmatist believing that truth could not be imposed from the top down , but only made real through concrete and sympathetic dialogue with people .
Where a regressive hegemony involves imposing a set of non-negotiable values upon the people , chiefly through use of coercion and deceit , a progressive hegemony will develop by way of democratically acquired consent in society .
To give some flesh to these differences , the remainder of this article will elaborate on the different ways in which Gramsci talks about hegemonies of currently and previously ruling classes and how these contrast with the progressive hegemony that he hoped to see in the future .
It is evident that if we look through history , the capitalist class has retained its hegemony primarily through various forms of coercion , ranging from the direct deployment of the military through to more subtle forms , for example , using economic power to marginalise political opponents .
It would , however , be a great mistake to think that capitalism does not also rely heavily upon building consent .
Indeed , it could be argued that it is capitalism ’s consent - building that we , from a strategic point of view , need to pay more attention to , as it is on this level that we compete with them .
The nature and strength of this consent varies .
There are ways in which capitalism succeeds in actively selling its vision to subordinate classes .
This means not only selling the distorted vision of a society of liberty , freedom , innovation , etc. , but also deploying the ideas of bourgeois economics to convince working people , for example , that although capitalist policy is in the ultimate interests of the capitalist class , they too gain some of the benefits via trickle - down effects .
Capitalism can also win consent among those who perhaps do n’t buy the idea that the system is in their interests , but who have been convinced that there is no alternative or that the alternatives would be worse – in other words , through the promotion of the belief that the system is a necessary evil .
The 20th century saw capitalism massively expand this form of consensus , largely through the corporate control of the media and advertising .
In the United States in particular , the promotion of the ``American dream ’’ , and all of the useless commodities required to attain it , served not only to massively boost consumption and thereby the economic interests of the capitalists , it also sold a way of life which only capitalism could deliver .
This was of course aided throughout the Cold War with simultaneous attempts to smear any alternative to capitalism as slavery .
The capitalist class , in opposing any policy attempts to close in on corporately owned media , used its hegemonic political power to create the conditions for the building of further consent , in turn expanding their interests .
The hegemonic group will continually struggle in this fashion to reach greater levels of consent – in this case by locking people into rigid mindsets and overcoming any optimism .
We can look at former Australian Prime Minister John Howard ’s attempts to expand privately owned schools , and to change high school history syllabi to make them more favourable to bourgeois perspectives as a part of this ongoing hegemonic process .
The ruling class will constantly try to expand its field of interests and win further consent in response to changes in context and challenges to legitimacy .
` Syndicalism ’
Certain forms of trade unionism can also be seen as examples of capitalist hegemony .
What Gramsci calls ``syndicalism ’’-- the view that the conditions of the workers can be maximally uplifted via the increasing power of the trade unions -- reflects a social group ( the workers ) left in the economic - corporate stage of development due to the hegemonic influence of capitalists , specifically free trade advocates , in the realm of ideology .
The free trade advocates argue that the state and civil society should be kept separate , that the state should keep out of the economic sphere , which functions autonomously – leave it to the ``invisible hand of the market ’’ and so on .
The syndicalists had adopted this assumption of an arbitrary separation of the social and economic realms on the one hand and the political realm on the other , and assume that they could bring about radical change without political representation .
The concrete result of this is that they are left to negotiate for narrowly defined improvements in the economic sphere , with no policy changes that would allow these wins to take on a more permanent basis .
Meanwhile , the free trade advocates are themselves actively involved in policy , despite their claims , setting up conditions that will be favourable to the capitalist class !
When the interests of the capitalist class are directly threatened , however , the hegemonic forces will inevitably resort to coercion .
There is no room to negotiate on this , within the current hegemonic order .
On a simple level this can mean legislating to allow police to crack down on workers taking industrial action , who threaten profits in an immediate sense .
But a far bigger threat to the capitalists is the development of a hegemonic alternative within civil society .
The threat is that people will move from the economic - corporate phase , and recognise that their interests overlap with all of those whom capitalism marginalises and holds back , that they will come to recognise their power and demand radical change .
This being the greatest threat to capital , the most effective way for it to use coercion is to break apart emerging progressive alliances between subordinate groups .
When confronted with force and economic bullying , the people are less able to relate to the group .
Concerns for survival mean that people have to defend their own interests as individuals .
The movement of the progressive hegemony is slowed , as people are forced to behave in a corporatist manner .
The ruling class can also try to violently break apart movements by stirring up ideological differences , appealing to religion , for example .
Democracy and consensus
Gramsci saw the development of a progressive hegemony involving a far greater degree of openness , democracy and consensus , rather than coercion .
In so far as there is coercion , it should only exist to hold back those reactionary forces that would thwart society ’s development .
This would allow the masses the space in which to reach their potential .
A large part of The Prison Notebooks is devoted to figuring out what would be required for this kind of hegemony to develop , and a lot of Gramscian thinkers since have devoted themselves to this puzzle .
As a starting point , we can say that while the existing hegemony tries to keep all the disaffected and subordinate social groups divided , the emergent progressive hegemony must bring them together .
Gramsci certainly recognised the challenge involved in this .
In his own historical situation ( and as is undoubtedly still the case in ours ) , there were considerable barriers between the marginalised groups in terms of experiences , language and worldview .
What all of these groups had in common , however , was that none of them had adequate political representation within the current system .
Gramsci calls these groups that lack political representation ``subaltern ’’ .
The challenge of the hegemonic group is to provide a critique of the system such that subaltern groups are made aware of their commonality and then ``raised up ’’ into the political life of the party .
In order to facilitate this incorporation of others , Gramsci stressed the need for the hegemonic group to move beyond its economic - corporatist understanding of its own interests , sacrificing some of its immediate economic goals in the interest of deeper moral and intellectual unity .
It would need to overcome its traditional prejudices and dogmas and take on a broader view if was to lead while maintaining trust and consensus ( both necessary to overcome existing power ) .
If these aligned forces are to have any historical significance , they need to be enduring and organically related to conditions on the ground , not merely a temporary convergence .
To develop mass momentum they would need to demonstrate , both in people ’s imagination and in action , that they were capable of coming to power and achieving the tasks they had set for themselves .
These tasks must effectively be everyone ’s tasks – they must come to represent every aspiration , and be the fulfilment of the failed movements of the previous generations .
Such a demonstration of power and historical significance could not be achieved through a passive action , of which Gramsci provides the example of the general strike .
If the movement simply represents the rejection of the existing system or non-participation in it , then it would quickly fragment into everyone ’s unique ideas of what should replace the system precisely at the moment when unity is most called for .
It must be an active embodiment of the collective will , crystallised in a constructive and concrete agenda for change .
Clearly this is no small ask , and Gramsci is certainly not of the view that one can just implement these strategies as though reading from a manual .
What is called for is for rigorous work on the ground laying the moral and intellectual terrain upon which these historical developments can occur .
One develops the unity , self - awareness and maturity of the movement , making it a powerful and cohesive force , and then patiently , with careful attention to the contextual conditions , waits for the opportune moment for this force to be exerted .
Moment of crisis
This moment is the moment of crisis within the existing , dominant hegemony : the moment at which it becomes clear to the populace that the ruling class can no longer solve the most pressing issues of humanity .
Provided that the progressive forces adequately assert the alternative at this moment and the ruling group is unable to rapidly rebuild consent , it becomes visible that the conditions under which the ruling group became hegemonic are now passing away and society can collectively say ``We do n’t need you anymore .’’.
Gramsci calls this process of historical purging ``catharsis ’’ in which ``structure ceases to be an external force which crushes man , assimilates him to itself and makes him passive ; and is transformed into a means of freedom , an instrument to create a new ethico - political form and a source of new initiatives . ’’ ( Gramsci , 1971 , p. 367 . )
For Gramsci the need for this transition from the world as it is to the freedom to create the world anew should be the starting point for all Marxist strategy .
So , what does Gramsci have to offer us ?
His insistence that the socialist political form should be one of openness , democracy and the building of consensus certainly provides us with greater vision and focus and really ought to inform the activities of all progressive political groups – if not for ethical reasons , then at least because in the present environment , without a willingness to genuinely work on building consensus with others , one ’s chances of success are very much diminished .
( We ’re not the ruling class – we do n’t have the means to coerce ) .
More than this , however , Gramsci provides us with a way of thinking ; he gives us the conceptual tools to dissect the political situation we find ourselves in , to view it in historical context and to understand where we can find the conditions for the further development of our power .

An Israeli citizen suffered mild to moderate gunshot wounds to his hand Tuesday evening near the West Bank settlement of Shvut Rachel , north of Jerusalem .
According to local settlers , at approximately 8 pm unknown assailants opened fire at an Israeli vehicle travelling east of Shvut Rachel .
Scene of shooting attack ( Photo : Gil Yohanan )
The injured Israeli continued driving until he reached the entrance to the settlement of Kida , where he received medical treatment from security forces .
The man was later evacuated to Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital in Jerusalem .
The shots apparently came from terrorists positioned at the side of the road .
" This is the fourth shooting in the area in the past four months , " Binyamin Council Head Avi Roeh told Ynet .
" This attack is a direct result of the removal of roadblocks .
It 's only by some miracle that the outcome of these attacks has been no worse than injuries , but you can not base security policies on miracles . "
In August two Israelis were lightly injured near the Givat Haroeh outpost .
The Israelis said Palestinians opened fire on the vehicle they were travelling in .
The shooters fled the scene and have yet to be apprehended .
Top 10 National Parks : Yosemite to Yellowstone to the Grand Canyon Ken Burns tells us about the magic of the national park system .
Sept. 28 , 2009  --
Our national parks have a way of mesmerizing visitors and reminding us of why we travel .
From sunset at the Grand Canyon to watching lava pour out of Kilauea to witnessing Old Faithful erupt for the first time , the parks leave memories that will last for decades .
" When you step out of the tour bus or out of the car and stretch your legs and walk over and look at the rim of the Grand Canyon there 's a great paradox that goes on .
You suddenly feel you 're insignificant yet that makes you bigger , it makes you feel connected to everyone else and everything else , " said filmmaker Ken Burns , whose new six - episode documentary The National Parks : America 's Best Idea is airing all this week on PBS .
Burns told ABC
News that he chose to focus on the national parksbecause they are " an utterly American invention . "
" Nobody else had ever set aside land in the past .
Only kings did that .
Only rich people got that , " Burns said .
" In America , in a democratic experiment everybody could own this land . "

For Burns , the parks are not so much about nature but about the connections that natural beauty helps bring .
" I 've watched families look down in awe , grab each other 's hands , look into each other 's eyes and then you realize that 's the real magic of the national parks , " he said .
" They 're not just showing you spectacular natural scenery , they 're also permitting you to have experiences with those closest to you in ways you 've never had before . "
There are 58 natural national parks in the U.S.
But the National Park Service also oversees another 333 battlefields , memorials , parkways , seashores , recreation areas and monuments .
They include everything from Abraham Lincoln 's birthplace to the Statue of Liberty to a memorial in Pennsylvania for the 9/11 victims of United Airlines flight 93 .
With that many parks , it 's a hard task to narrow down a list of the 10 best .
We know everybody has their own personal favorites -- and by choosing only 10 , we also left some of our favorites off the list .
( The Petrified Forest and Rocky Mountain National Park are just two of our favorites that missed the cut . )
These 10 parks represent some of the most spectacular and awe - inspiring natural formations in the country .
But first , we had to ask Ken Burns about his favorite national park .
The filmmaker said that most favorites are based on personal experiences .
He was in Yosemite for the first shoot of his documentary and remembered that in 1959 , when he was six years old , his dad took him to Shenandoah National Park in Virginia .
" My mom was sick and dying of cancer and we were distracted .
And I had forgotten that .
All of the sudden , lying there awake in Yosemite , I could remember what his hand felt like in mine , I could remember all the songs he sang to me , the hike we took .
It was mind - blowing .
It just changed my life , " Burns said .
" So now , in some ways Yosemite and Shenandoah are paired in my mind as my favorite places . "
So let 's go over our list .
Hopefully , you too will soon have a favorite .
This park along the rugged Maine coast has 125 miles of hiking trails and 45 miles of spectacular carriage roads that can be explored by bike or a horse - drawn carriage tour .
Kayaking and canoeing are popular activities and two beaches in the park offer salt and fresh water for swimming .
Acadia is an excellent park to watch spring warblers , sea ducks , and migrating birds of prey .
Ranger - led birdwalks are offered from late spring to mid-fall .
For some breathtaking views of the ocean , mountains and surrounding forests drive the 27 - mile Park Loop Road .
To get high above it all , add in the 3.5 - mile road up Cadillac Mountain .
At 1,530 feet , Cadillac is not only the tallest mountain in the park , but also the tallest mountain along the eastern coast of the United States .
Rising high above the town of Bar Harbor , Cadillac offers magnificent views of the Porcupine Islands and Frenchman Bay .
The Top National Parks
This park , the largest subtropical wilderness in the United States , boasts rare and endangered species .
It has been designated a World Heritage Site , International Biosphere Reserve , and Wetland of International Importance , significant to all people of the world .
The national park is the 3rd largest in the lower 48 states , covering 2,500 square miles .
There 's no one point to start your journey .
The park can be accessed from Everglades City to Homestead to Key Largo .
Camping , boating , hiking , and even a visit to a former missile base in the center of the park are all possible in the Everglades .
The park can be explored by airboat , regular boats , tram tours and perhaps the most serene way to sightsee : by canoe or kayak .
Everglades National Park has 156 miles of canoe , kayak and walking trails .
To really get away from it all , consider the 47 designated wilderness campsites , a real great opportunity for solitude .
Popular activities range from photographing the birds to hiking to watching alligators or to just sitting around a campfire relaxing .
The park preserves more than 2,000 natural sandstone arches , including the world - famous Delicate Arch , and many other unusual rock formations .
In some areas , the forces of nature have exposed millions of years of geologic history .
The extraordinary features of the park create a landscape of contrasting colors , landforms and textures that is unlike any other in the world .
Arches contains the greatest density of natural arches in the world .
The park is located in a " high desert , " with elevations ranging from 4,085 to 5,653 feet above sea level .
The climate is one of very hot summers , cold winters and very little rainfall .
The park 's more than 2,000 catalogued arches range in size from a three - foot opening ( the minimum considered to be an arch ) , to Landscape Arch which measures 306 feet from base to base .
Towering spires , fins and balanced rocks complement the arches , creating a remarkable assortment of landforms in a relatively small area .
Nearby is Canyonlands National Park a series of canyons , mesas and buttes crafted by the Colorado River and its tributaries .
Many visitors like to pair a trip to one of these parks with a stop at the other .
Both of these parks can experience brutally hot summers and chilly winters with snow .
No place else on earth combines a deep , pure lake , so blue in color ; sheer surrounding cliffs , almost 2,000 feet high ; two picturesque islands and a violent volcanic past .
Generous amounts of winter snow , averaging 533 inches per year , supply the lake with water .
There are no inlets or outlets to the lake .
Crater Lake , at 1,943 feet deep , is the seventh deepest lake in the world and the deepest in the United States .
Evaporation and seepage prevent the lake from becoming any deeper .
There are also abundant squirrels and chipmunks throughout the park .
Bald eagles are seen fairly often in the summer – especially from the boats .
Golden Eagles are more rare , but usually make an appearance a couple times a year .
The water is so blue because there is hardly anything else in it – just water .
It 's not pure water , but it 's close .
But because of the lake 's depth , that water is cold .
The average temperature -- below 300 feet deep -- is 38 degrees .
In the summer , the surface can warm to 55 or 56 degrees .
Yosemite National Park
Yosemite was one of the first wilderness parks in the United States and is best known for its waterfalls .
But within its nearly 1,200 square miles , you can find deep valleys , grand meadows , ancient giant sequoias , a vast wilderness area , and much more .
Visitors can drive cars into and around Yosemite but the massive amounts of crowds that visit the park have led the National Park Service to strongly encourage people to use the free shuttle bus system .
( The only reason Yosemite is n't higher on our list is because of these very crowds .
It is a spectacular place , but in peak season sometimes you struggle to escape from your fellow visitors . )
But back to the attractions .
Yosemite is home to countless waterfalls .
The best time to see waterfalls is during spring , when most of the snowmelt occurs .
Peak runoff typically occurs in May or June , with some waterfalls ( including Yosemite Falls ) often only a trickle or completely dry by August .
Other famous falls include Bridalveil , Wapama and Ribbon .
Half Dome is perhaps the most recognized symbol of Yosemite .
Rising nearly 5,000 feet above the Valley floor , it is one of the most sought - after landmarks in Yosemite .
Some people even hike or rock - climb to the top .
El Capitan is a favorite for experienced rock climbers .
Rising more than 3,000 feet above the Valley floor , it is the largest monolith of granite in the world .
The park also has giant sequoias , also known as Sierra redwoods that are a must for any visitor .
The park includes more than a million acres of land .
The Colorado River travels for 277 miles through the canyon from Lees Ferry to the Grand Wash Cliffs .
At the South Rim , near Grand Canyon Village , it 's a vertical mile -- about 5,000 feet -- from the rim to river or a 7 - mile hike .
The width of the canyon at Grand Canyon Village is 10 miles although in places it is as wide as 18 miles .
The Grand Canyon has two very different personalities .
Most visitors see the South Rim , the most - accessible part of the park that is open year round .
Just 10 miles away as the crow flies is the vastly different North Rim .
It 's 1,000 feet higher , typically inaccessible from October to mid-May because of heavy snows and much more remote .
They might only be 10 miles apart in the air , but driving between the two is a 220 - mile trip .
Or you can hike the 21 miles from rim to rim but that typically takes two the three days .
( A rafting trip down the Colorado can take two weeks or longer . )
While the Grand Canyon is probably the world 's most famous canyon , it is not the deepest .
Barranca del Cobre in northern Mexico and Hell 's Canyon in Idaho are both deeper .
And those are just two examples .
The canyon was first afforded federal protection in 1893 as a Forest Reserve and later as a National Monument .
But it was n't until 1919 -- three years after the creation of the National Park Service -- that the Grand Canyon achieved National Park status .
That first year , 44,173 people visited the park .
Today , nearly five million visitors a year come to gaze out at its beauty .
At sunset , visitors carrying flashlights trek out to the end of the ocean to watch lava flow into the water .
A few miles away , a crater that visitors could once hike through is now erupting for the first time since 1982 , sending an ash - laden plume into the air .
Elsewhere , visitors can hike through a hollowed - out tube that once carried lava .
The park highlights two of the world 's most active volcanoes , and offers insights on the birth of the Hawaiian Islands and views of dramatic volcanic landscapes .
The current eruption of Kilauea has destroyed 187 structures including the park 's Wahaula Visitors Center .
The current eruption rate of Kilauea volcano is 250,000 - 650,000 cubic yards a day .
That is enough to resurface a 20 - mile - long two - lane road every day .
But remember , the eruption has been continuous since 1983 .
That would make the stack of lava on the road about 20 miles tall .
Be warned : visitors to the park , even returning ones , should always check in with the park staff to see what sites are open .
Lava flow activity is always changing and you never know what 's in store for your visit .
The Best National Parks
It takes a minimum of three hours to drive to the 13 viewpoints along the park 's 38 - mile round - trip scenic drive .
But this park has more to offer .
Bryce Canyon is famous for its night sky and the lack of artificial light .
To highlight this , the parks service runs a " Dark Rangers " program introducing visitors to the wonders of the night .
The rim of the canyon is between 8,000 to 9,100 feet above sea level .
In summer , daytime temperatures are in the 80s but fall to the 40s by night .
Many visitors pair a trip to Bryce with nearby Zion National Park , whose east entrance is just 78 miles away .
Zion 's massive canyon walls surround visitors as they trek through the park .
These unique sandstone cliffs range in color from cream , to pink , to red and give an amazing show during sunrise and sunset .
One of the nation 's most unique and spectacular hikes takes place along the canyon floor .
Simply called The Narrows , visitors hike through the Virgin River up into the park 's canyon .
The walls get narrower and narrower along the way and the river gets higher , making hiking a wet but enjoyable experience .
But be warned , the narrow canyon walls leave out most of the sunlight and the running river brings in cold water .
Flash floods and strong currents also present real dangers that can be life - threatening .
Established in 1872 , Yellowstone National Park is America 's first national park .
Located in Wyoming , Montana , and Idaho , it is home to a large variety of wildlife including grizzly bears , wolves , bison , and elk .
But what really bring people to this massive park are the geysers and hot springs .
Walk along boardwalks with bubbling water and mud surrounding you .
Stare at amazement as the geysers spew boiling water into beautiful fountains up in the air .
Of course , the most famous – and predictable – geyser is Old Faithful .
But there is more to this park .
It boasts its own " Grand Canyon " which features the Upper and Lower Falls of the Yellowstone River .
The Lower Falls is 308 feet high and can be seen from various lookout points , including one at the lip of the falls .
It is often described as being more than twice the size of Niagara , although this only refers to its height and not the volume of water flowing over it .
For something completely different , check out Mammoth Hot Springs .
These features are quite different from thermal areas elsewhere in the park .
Travertine formations grow much more rapidly than sinter formations due to the softer nature of limestone .
As hot water rises through limestone , large quantities of rock are dissolved by the hot water , and a white chalky mineral is deposited on the surface .
Visitors should also check out Yellowstone Lake , the largest lake at high elevation lake in North America .
It is a natural lake , situated at 7,733 feet above sea level .
It is roughly 20 miles long and 14 miles wide with 141 miles of shoreline .
It freezes in late December or early January and thaws in late May or early June .
Death Valley is about 140 miles long and has 3.4 million acres of desert and mountains , making it the largest national park in the contiguous United States .
It is the hottest , driest and lowest place around .
The park , about a two - hour drive from Las Vegas , is best visited in the spring when wildflowers can bloom or the winter when it is cool enough to walk around .
By May the valley is too hot for most visitors , yet throughout the hottest months , visitors from around the world still flock to the park .
Lodging and camping are available , but only the most hardy will want to camp in the low elevations in the summer .
Most summer visitors tour by car to the main points of interest along the paved roads but do little else due to the extreme heat
In July of 1913 , the temperature hit a shocking 134 degrees in the valley .
It has n't been that hot since , but other days have come close .
Back on July 6 , 2007 , it touched 129 degrees .
At that point , what 's the difference ?
The summer of 2001 came with 154 consecutive days where temperatures reached 100 degrees .
And 1996 was the hottest summer on record with 40 days over 120 degrees .
Wow .
But if you can stand the heat , the park is simply spectacular .
The park has many different attractions , including vast sand dunes and high peaks overlooking the valley .
But the real highlight is Badwater Basin .
At 282 feet below sea level , is not just the lowest place in the park , it 's the lowest in North America .
It 's a surreal landscape of vast salt flats .
Walking across it -- in cooler weather -- makes visitors feel like they are walking on the moon .
Or at least some unearthly place .
Nearby , is the Devil 's Golf Course , an immense area of rock salt eroded by wind and rain into jagged spires .
The area is so serrated that it was once said that " only the devil could play golf on such rough links . "
If you prefer some simpler links , the Furnace Creek Golf Course provides a more traditional game .
It also happens to be the lowest in the world .
Ron Brownstein makes an interesting point :
But with Republicans operating as a parliamentary party of opposition , Democrats will have to pass health care reform virtually , if not entirely , alone .
That leaves them with a binary choice : Democrats can either fragment into stalemate or function as a parliamentary majority party by unifying enough to advance their agenda .
The choice would seem straightforward .
If one side in a firefight is operating with military cohesion and the other devolves into ragged , undirected units , it ’s not hard to predict which will suffer more casualties .
I do n’t think this is necessarily bad news in this case .
Democrats are likely to be mostly the majority party for the next generation .
The extent to which they are able to get around the filibuster - fucking around ineffectuality of typical American governing coalitions and ram stuff through Congress will be the same extent to which they are able to make the United States into a normal first - world country .

The London Stock Exchange has agreed to acquire MillenniumIT , and will be replacing its TradElect and Infolect systems with the MillenniumIT trading system .
TradElect is based on Windows Server and .NET , and was created by Microsoft and Accenture .
Microsoft used to use the LSE ’s system as a showcase for .NET scalability , but while it proved that .NET can work for large systems , the LSE suffered an outage in September 2008 that was rumoured to be the fault of TradElect .
I do n’t know much about MillenniumIT but note that the company is a partner with Sun and Oracle and that the MillenniumIT Exchange brochure [ pdf ] states :
Operating System : UNIX or Linux Database : Oracle
As Brian Bryson of IBM / Rational observes , it is short - sighted to lay the blame on the platform .
Nevertheless , considering the high profile of this system and Microsoft ’s active involvement it is at least an embarrassment .
The mitigation for Microsoft is that .NET has less to prove these days .
Even if running a system as large and performance - critical as the London Stock Exchange was a step too far , particularly for Server 2003 and ( apparently ) SQL Server 2000 , that does n’t rule out Microsoft ’s technology for more usual workloads ; and there are improvements in Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008 .
Still , I ’d love to know more about why the LSE is abandoning TradElect and what the lessons are for those designing and implementing systems at this level .
The problems with TradElect are thoroughly debated in the comments here .

The Spring Framework
Nico Mommaerts , Pieter Degreauwe
Introduction
Before the Spring revolution , enterprise applications were generally written using the J2EE standards ( specified by a group of vendors via the JCP process ) .
The premise of J2EE was multiplatform / multivendor , if you would code against the J2EE standards you could deploy your application on any J2EE application server , on any platform .
In theory at least .
Running your application on an application server has several benefits , the application server offers you services , such as transaction management , messaging , mailing , a directory interface etc .
Any J2EE compliant code can make use of these services , as long as the code is written against the interfaces defined in the J2EE specifications .
Unfortunately , there were a few problems with these standards .
First of all , the usage of these standards was too complex .
Writing a component ( EJB : Enterprise Java Bean ) required you to write a set of xml files ( deployment descriptors ) , home interfaces , remote / local interfaces , etc .
Even worse , 50 % of the deployment descriptors were vendor specific , so ' transparently migrating an application from vendor A to B ' was suddenly not so transparent anymore ...
Secondly , there was the ' look - up ' problem .
When a component requires another component , the components itself was responsible for looking up the components it depends upon .
Unfortunately , this look - up happens by name , so the name of the dependency was hardcoded in your component ( code or deployment descriptor ) .
On top of that , letting components communicate with each other from J2EE application servers of different vendors was almost always problematic .
Last but not least , in a lot of cases , some components did not need all the services the application server provided , but since there was no other API to build components , all your components became heavy weight , bloating your application .
With ' heavy weight ' components we mean that they supported all features ( clustering , remoting , etc. ) even when we did n't need them .
You could say ' but we get it for free , what 's the problem ? '
The problem with this is that ' get it for free ' means we do not need to write this functionality , but we need to configure them .
And this is why most developers longed for writing plain old Java objects , without the need to write ton's of xml configuration for stuff they did n't need ...
The POJO Revolution
As said before , one of the goals of these J2EE standards was to give the developer some services for free so he could focus on writing the business logic .
This is still a very interesting goal , but it turned out that the programming model was not so flexible as one would like .
Coding against the J2EE standards was very cumbersome , you needed to comply to several seemingly arbitrary rules , and it forced you to write code that was not so Object Oriented as one would want to .
If you wanted to take advantage of the J2EE services you had to implement your classes in a very specific way , which coupled your business logic to the J2EE classes .
It made your code less extensible , and not very test friendly .
Since your code used specific J2EE classes and interfaces , you could n't run that code in a unit test , since it presumes all kinds of services present , normally provided by the J2EE application server .
This is what we mean with code that is not testable outside of the container ( the application server is the container ) .
Deploying a J2EE application in a container and starting it up can be a very time - consuming task , so not very ideal if you want to run your unit tests regularly .
More and more developers wanted to write just Plain Old Java Objects ( we 'll call them POJO 's from now on ) , without the J2EE standards overhead .
And to be honest , they were right .
Writing business logic in POJO 's is way easier .
You do n't have to implement any interfaces or extend from other classes , you are free to cleanly implement and design your domain with regular Java classes and you do n't have to jump through hoops to test your code .
The only problem with POJO 's is that with J2EE ( as it existed then ) you cannot benefit from the services provided by the container , such as transaction management , remoting , etc .
This is where the Spring Framework comes in .
This framework brings a lightweight container .
This is a container where your POJO 's live in .
The difference with a heavyweight container is that the components now are as light as possible .
You do n't have to support services you do n't need , this also means no unneeded configuration .
You do n't have to adhere to some programming model , you can just use POJO 's and declaratively specify what services you want to use .
Due to the openness of this container and the use of AOP ( Aspect Oriented Programming ) , it is possible to enhance POJO 's in such a way that it does n't affect the code of your POJO .
So , your POJO stays as clean as possible and you can add features as you need them .
The Spring framework , what is it ?
It is not a web framework , or a persistence framework , it 's a framework that integrates all kinds of Java technologies / API 's en makes it possible to use them with simple POJO's .
What is important to know is that Spring does not reinvent the wheel .
It provides a nice and elegant way to use existing technologies ( such as EJB , Hibernate , JDO , Toplink , JMS , etc ) .
This is accomplished by several support classes and ' templates ' .
Why and how is Spring more elegant ?
Let 's look at an example .
We want to query the number of users that are older than a specified age .
Using the conventional methods using the standard JDBC API , we would write something like this :
... Connection conn = .. ; PreparedStatement stm ; ResultSet resultSet ; try { stm = conn.prepareStatement ( " select count ( 0 ) from user u where u.age > ? " ) ; stm.setInt( 1,age ) ; resultSet = stm.executeQuery ( ) ; resultSet.next ( ) ; return resultSet.getIn ( 1 ) ; } finally { resultSet.close ( ) ; stm.close ( ) ; conn.close ( ) ; }
This is already simplified code , since you actually should check for NullPointerExceptions in the finally clause and you should catch SQLExceptions .
However , you can see that this is a very verbose way of writing code .
Making use of Spring 's JdbcTemplate gives more elegant code :
SimpleJdbcTemplate template = new SimpleJdbcTemplate ( datasource ) ; //this jdbcTemplate supports varArgs . int userCount = template.queryForInt(" select count ( 0 ) from user u where u.age > ? " , age ) ;
Of course this is a very simple example , but it should give you an idea how it makes coding Java applications much easier by removing boilerplate code from your application code .
This example illustrates the JdbcTemplate , however , Spring provides lots of templates : TransactionTemplate , HibernateTemplate , ToplinkTemplate , JDOTemplate , JMSTemplate , etc .
For each supported technology there is a module which consists of helper classes to help you implement a certain layer or aspect of your application .
The core of Spring , upon which all other modules depend , is the Inversion of Control and Aspect - Oriented programming module .
It is these two programming models which are the driving force behind Spring .
They act like glue , pulling your application together , but in a not - invasive way .
Meaning the code you write does n't need to have Spring references all over the place .
In places where you need to use specific frameworks or standards ( Hibernate , JMS , etc ) Spring lets you integrate easily using these techniques .
What is Inversion of Control ?
When developing an application , you always have dependencies between and on components , services , classes etc.
Without Inversion of Control you would ' wire ' these together on the spot where you would need the dependency .
The disadvantage of this is that when you would like to use a different implementation of your dependency , you are forced to change your code .
This may not seem that big a disadvantage , but what if you want to change your implementation in context of the environment you are running your code in ?
For example you might want to use a different authentication service during development as in production .
It is not really convenient to change your code every time you need to make a production artifact , or each time you want to run your unit - tests .
That 's why the wiring of these dependencies is taken out of the code , and an external party manages the wiring , namely the container .
Hence the name inversion of control , you let something from the outside control how your dependencies are wired together .
We speak of dependency injection because the container ' injects ' the necessary dependencies instead of letting the developer manage them .
For example , we have a class PrinterService , which is responsible for sending some document to a Printer .
We can have different Printer implementations , laser , inkjet etc .
class PrinterService { private Printer printer = new InkjetPrinter ( ) ; public PrinterService ( ) { } public void printDocument ( Document doc ) { printer. print ( doc ) ; } }
This way , everybody who uses the PrinterService has no choice but to use the InkjetPrinter .
Not really what we want , we want to be able to use other printers .
If we write a unit test for the PrinterService , we do n't want the implementation of the Printer tested , and we certainly do n't want a page coming from our printer every time we run the unit test !
So we want to be able to change the implementation of the Printer used in the PrinterService .
Let 's try the following :
class PrinterService { private Printer printer ; public PrinterService ( ) { } public void setPrinter ( Printer printer ) { this .
printer = printer ; } public void printDocument ( Document doc ) { printer. print ( doc ) ; } }
Now if someone wants to use the PrinterService he can do something like this :
PrinterService printerService = new PrinterService ( ) ; printerService.setPrinter(new LaserPrinter ( ) ) ; printerService.printDocument(someDocument ) ;
As you can see the usage of the PrinterService is n't limited anymore to the InkjetPrinter we defined in the first example .
However , we still have to wire the Printer implementation to the PrinterService ourselves .
If we want to run this code in a different context , with a different printer implementation , one for testing purposes for example , we still have to branch somewhere in our code to make a distinction between the different contexts / implementations .
Now this is where Spring as a container comes into the picture .
We want to let Spring handle the wiring of the dependencies of our PrinterService .
To do this we let the PrinterService and the Printer ' live ' inside the Spring container , as such they are called beans .
We give each bean a unique name , an id , so we can reference them later on .
We can declare this in a Spring xml configuration file ( xml schema declaration omitted for brevity ) :
< beans > < bean id=" laserPrinter " class=" com.methodsandtools.LaserPrinter " /> < bean id=" inkjetPrinter"class="com.methodsandtools.InkjetPrinter " /> < bean id=" printerService" class=" com.methodsandtools.PrinterService " > < property name= " printer " ref=" laserPrinter " /> </ bean > </ beans >
In this example we defined two Printer beans , ' laserPrinter ' and ' inkjetPrinter ' .
We used the property ' printer ' on the ' printerService ' to wire the ' laserPrinter ' to the ' printerService ' bean .
What actually happens is that the ' setPrinter ' method on the ' printerService ' bean is called with the ' laser Printer ' bean as argument .
These beans and their lifecycle are now managed by the Spring container , we could configure if we want a new instance of the laserPrinter bean be created every time we inject it somewhere , or if we only want one instance of the laserPrinter bean to live in the container and that one be used all the time .
Managing this lifecycle is beyond the scope of this article , but is nevertheless a very interesting and necessary capability of the Spring container .
Now , if we want to use the PrinterService , we have to ask the Spring container the bean we declared in the configuration file .
The Spring container is accessed through a bean factory :
XmlBeanFactory beanFactory = new XmlBeanFactory ( new ClassPathResource ( " configuration.xml " , getClass ( ) ) ) ; PrinterService printerService = ( PrinterService ) beanFactory .getBean ( " printerService " ) ;
We now have a PrinterService instance which we can use without worrying what Printer implementation is wired to it .
In a different context we can use a different configuration file , no code needs to be changed in order to use a different Printer implementation .
You can also split the declaration of the beans over multiple xml files , so you can pick and mix to your needs .
Note that the above code does n't need to run in a J2EE container , meaning you do n't need to start an application server and deploy it , it can be run as a regular Java program .
Although we declared the bean factory ourselves in this example , usually in a J2EE application there will be a bean factory associated with a context defined by the J2EE server and you wo n't see any Spring code in the business logic .
So you are not tied to using an API or implement some interfaces as with standard J2EE to use the Inversion of Control container .
Once you start working this way , you 'll soon start thinking in terms of declaring beans and wiring them together .
There are more possibilities as demonstrated , like using inheritance between beans , controlling the lifecycle , autowiring dependencies based upon type , etc , but the above example should give you a basic understanding of the power of Dependency Injection in Spring .
What is Aspect - Oriented programming ?
In most applications there are concerns that ' cut ' across different abstraction layers , the typical example is logging .
You might want to log in every method of your service layer that you are entering and exiting that specific method .
This litters log statements all over your service layer , while logging is actually one concern and as such should be separated from the business logic into a different entity .
This is what Aspect - Oriented Programming frameworks ( we 'll cal it AOP from now ) aim to do .
In AOP terminology a concern is written as an advice , which is an entity like a class .
Then this advice can be applied to certain pointcuts in your code .
A pointcut is a place or several places in your code where you want the crosscutting concern , the advice , to be applied .
For example when entering or exiting a certain method .
An advice together with a pointcut is called an aspect , hence the name Aspect - Oriented Programming .
There are many AOP frameworks out there , Spring uses its own based upon dynamic proxies and / or CGLIB byte code generation , but can integrate with others like AspectJ if desired .
A simple example of an advice , straight from the Spring javadocs :
class TracingInterceptor implements MethodInterceptor { Object invoke( MethodInvocation i ) throws
Throwable { System.out.println ( " method " + i.getMethod( ) + " is called on " + i.getThis ( ) + " with args " +i.getArguments ( ) ) ; Object ret = i.proceed ( ) ; System.out.println ( " method " + i.getMethod( ) + " returns " + ret ) ; return ret ; } }
The above advice is invoked when a method is intercepted , which methods will be intercepted is defined in the pointcut , more on this later .
The ' invoke ' method receives a MethodInvocation instance which contains all the needed information about the method being intercepted .
This can be seen in the System .
out statement where we print all this information .
The next line is also very interesting , we tell the method being intercepted to proceed , so this means that if we would like to , we could prevent the invocation of the intercepted method !
Now that we have defined what to do with the intercepted method , we have to define which methods will be intercepted .
These two concepts are separated , which is a powerful principle .
Saying which methods to advice is done in a pointcut , which is also an interface to be implemented , the Pointcut interface , which looks like this :
public interface Pointcut { ClassFilter getClassFilter ( ) ; MethodMatcher getMethodMatcher ( ) ; }
For the most common cases there are a lot of standard implementations of this interface in the Spring framework .
One of the most ( in ) famous of the J2EE standards is the EJB standard , Enterprise Java Beans .
Among other things , it provides declarative transaction management for your database access code .
Managing your transactions in your database access code is something you have to do each time you make a call to the database , so being able to do this declaratively in an xml file was a real advantage .
However , to benefit from this you had to code against an API , which sometimes meant having up to 7 files for one EJB , having to implement arbitrary methods , and your EJB would only work if deployed in a J2EE application server .
This is just one example of the services that J2EE provides , but is a real pain to use because of the API you have to program against .
What Spring aims to do is to give you the same services as provided by J2EE , e.g. transaction management , but in such a way that you can still code using POJO's .
Spring accomplishes this by using AOP .
Testability
As said before , writing tests for EJB 's were quite problematic , since your components ( EJB's ) had to run in a running container .
Writing your components in the POJO model solves this completely .
But that is not all , Spring brings some nice features for writing integration tests .
Especially useful are the transactional tests , which you can configure to rollback all inserted data , so your test database stays clean and wo n't interfere with other tests or the same test if it should fail .
You are not required to manually clean up your test data after each test .
Let 's look at an example :
@RunWith ( SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class ) @ContextConfiguration ( locations = { " /applicationContext.xml " , " /database-test.xml " }) @ Transactional public class FictitiousTransactionalTest { @ Autowired // inject by type private PetClinicService petClinicService ; @ Resource ( name = " hibernateTemplate " ) // inject by name private HibernateTemplate hibernateTemplate ; @ Before public void setUpTestDataWithinTransaction ( ) { // set up test data within the transaction } @ Test public void modifyDatabaseWithinTransaction ( ) { // logic which uses the test data and modifies database state hibernateTemplate.save( VetTestObjectMother.createDummyVet( ) ) ; hibernateTemplate.save(VetTestObjectMother.createDummyVet( ) ) ; assertEquals ( 2 , petClinicService.countVet ( ) ) ; } @ Test @ NotTransactional public void performNonDatabaseRelatedAction ( ) { // logic which does not modify database state } }
First of all , we can define the Spring context files ( the files where we wire all POJO 's together ) , that should be loaded by the integration test .
( @ContextConfiguration )
Secondly , we can inject some components into our test , so , we can start testing them .
( @Resource and @ Autowired )
For integration tests , it is especially useful that we can perform our tests in one transaction , and rollback that transaction after the test has run .
( @Transactional , @NotTransactional , @ BeforeTransaction , @ AfterTransaction , @ TransactionConfiguration )
Conclusion : To Spring or not To Spring ?
As you might have already understood , we really think that most applications ( if not all ) should use a lightweight Dependency Injection container .
Inversion of Control promotes loose coupling and testability of your code , the POJO programming model is how it should have always been .
( IoC really enables testabillity of the code , the POJO programming model , etc ) .
Spring is the most popular and widely accepted DI container there is for Java .
It 's entirely up to you how much you use it .
You can choose to just use some of the supporting classes or templates , or you can go full out and make your entire application use Spring beans .
Besides the core Spring functionality which we covered here , over the years a lot of extra modules appeared which do replace existing technologies .
For example Spring Web Flow is a very nice framework built upon the Spring framework for building Web applications .
With Spring it 's your choice which API 's you use , and how you build your application .

Birthers claim Obama was n’t born in the U.S. ( he was born in Honolulu ) , though all the Constitution requires is that the President be a natural - born citizen .
But trying to argue with birthers is a lot like trying to argue with ... anti-choicers .
If you have n’t flipped on a TV for the past couple of weeks , you may be blissfully ignorant , but alas the rest of the country and most of the world has been subjected to the mainstreaming of a racist conspiracy nicknamed “ birtherism ” , which is the belief that Barack Obama is faking his birth certificate and therefore citizenship , and is secretly disqualified to be President .
Birthers claim that Obama was n’t born in the U.S. ( he was born in Honolulu ) , and interestingly , they ignore the fact that all the Constitution requires is that the President be a natural - born citizen , which means any child born in 1961 of Stanley Ann Dunham Obama would have been a citizen , even if they were born on the moon .
But trying to argue with birthers is a lot like trying to argue with …. anti-choicers , actually .
And the splashing of birther conspiracy theories all over the place is cluing your average American into some unpleasant aspects of movement conservatism that those of us who ’ve tangled with the anti-choice movement have known for a long time .
Is it fair to compare anti-choice nuttery to birther conspiracy theories ?
Well , of course .
First of all , there ’s a great deal of overlap between birthers and anti-choicers .
Certainly , politicians think both groups are one and the same people .
James Inhofe , one of the most outspoken and aggressive anti-choicers in the Senate , obviously believes his base wants to hear about how birthers have a " point " , even though it takes roughly two sentences and a quick perusal of the Constitution to point that this is impossible .
But maybe he ’s reading the same data I am , that shows that 63 % of Republicans are " pro-life " and 58 % are somewhere on the birther scale .
And just as anti-choice sentiment is strongest in the South and Midwest , birtherism is as well .
With that in mind , I made a list of aspects of movement conservatism that you ’re probably learning about the birther movement that you would have known already if you had followed the anti-choice movement closely .
Truth is considered a mere obstacle between them and their goals .
For ordinary Americans struggling to understand the birthers , the most frustrating thing about them must be their utter contempt for evidence , reality , or any form of inconvenient truth .
No matter how many times birthers are shown pictures of Obama ’s birth certificate , no matter how many times they ’re reminded that Obama is a citizen both through his birth geography and his mother ’s citizenship , no matter how many people call them cranks — they do not care .
Reality is unimportant , compared to what they believe .
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .

Pro-choicers recognize this tendency well , since it ’s a defining trait of the anti-choice movement .
The lies pile up so fast with anti-choicers it ’s hard to keep up :
That there ’s no such thing as a medically necessary abortion .
That abortion causes breast cancer .
That contraception is the reason couples divorce .
That the birth control works by aborting a pregnancy .
That condoms are n’t effective at preventing the spread of HIV .
Honestly , if you want to know how movement conservatives got so good at ignoring inconvenient truths , I ’d say that they cut their teeth in many ways in opposing reproductive rights .
Racism is the unspoken motivator .
Interestingly , movement conservatives are n’t just obsessed with the circumstances of Obama ’s birth when they ’re wearing their birther hats .
For a long time now , anti-choicers have dwelt upon an obsessive insistence , against all evidence , that Obama ’s mother wanted to abort her pregnancy , and was merely prevented by illegal abortion .
Catholic
Vote has done an ad implying this , and going so far as to call Obama ’s mother a “ single mother ” , even though she was married to his father when he was born .
And , as I document in last week ’s podcast , the myth reached the House floor when Representative Todd Tiahrt claimed that Obama is here only due to the unavailability of abortion in 1961 .
He also said the same thing about Clarence Thomas , in case there was any doubt about what he was hinting at .
There ’s no reason to think that Obama ’s mother wanted an abortion in 1961 and was forced to have a baby against her will .
Yes , she was young and pregnant when she got married , but that was the custom in that era .
The only difference between her and most young mothers / wives of that era was the racial make - up of her marriage .
Thus , the ready assumption that she was eager to abort is no doubt based in the conservative belief that interracial relationships are seedy .
Similarly , Obama is far from the first presidential candidate that ’s both a Democrat and has a parent that ’s a non-native citizen .
Both of Michael Dukakis ’s parents were immigrants from Greece , but unlike with Obama , right wingers did n’t start early on in the campaign trying to sue to stop him from being eligible for office .
It ’s not that they liked his policies one bit better , but they did prefer his skin color .
Odious positions do n’t go away , they just morph into something more media - friendly .
While the anti-choice movement is motivated primarily by a desire to control sex and stomp out women ’s liberation , they realize that this position is n’t going to fly over well with a public that enjoys sex and households that rely on female income .
That ’s why they came up with The Almighty Fetus as a way to spin it .
They ’re not interested in driving women into the home and stomping out non-approved sex — despite their anti-contraception activism — oh no , it ’s about the pure love of fetal life !
In the same way , you ’re beginning to see the leadership in the conservative movement cast around for ways to keep the issue alive , while covering up the true ugliness of its proponents ’ motivations .
Their efforts might seem inadequate now , but I imagine over time and testing , they ’ll find a cover story that words as well as fetal love is working for people who like to scream as sexually active women entering clinics .
Everything ’s a conspiracy .
Unable to face up to the fact that doctors provide abortions for the mundane reason that female patients ask for them , anti-choicers have concocted an elaborate conspiracy theory about how abortion is an “ industry ” based around tricking women into getting abortions for profit .
Like all conspiracy theorists , they take evidence against the theory as if it were evidence that the network of conspirators is vast .
So , if you Jane Blogger point out that Planned Parenthood is a non-profit that helps patients avoid abortion through contraception , the anti-choicer will assume you ’re part of the conspiracy and argue that contraception is part of the abortion conspiracy .
The birther conspiracy theory works the same way — pointing out evidence and logical arguments only expands the size and scope of the conspiracy in the minds of birthers .
In fact the “ Obama faked his birth certificate and was born outside of the U.S. ” theory apparently erupted in part from an earlier conspiracy theory over Obama ’s middle name .
With birthers , as with anti-choicers , more evidence of reality just gets them further into the thick of imagining even more complex and strange conspiracies .
And just as the anti-choicers have moved on to concocting theories about how Planned Parenthood is part of a child sex ring that they ’re covering up , I suspect the birther thing may grow in ways that are frightening in their complexity and lack of touch with reality .
When it comes to S.& P. , he does n’t utter the word “ regrets ”  which S.& P. bigwigs tend to volunteer these days .
In two hours of interviews in his office one recent afternoon , about the closest that he will come to suggesting that anything went haywire at S.& P. is this : “ Assumptions were made and with respect to a portion of securitized ratings , the assumptions did n’t work . ”
Sitting behind a huge desk in a corner office , dressed in a light blue Oxford shirt and a blue tie , he seems most comfortable discussing the finer points of law .
Even now , in the senior - discount stage of his life , he gives the impression of a man fit enough to put you in a headlock , though he also seems too well mannered for fisticuffs .
He answers questions deliberately , like one accustomed to having his words read back in a transcript .
As he speaks , he slowly moves his coffee cup from a spot on his desk to a perch on a small stack of Post - it notes , then back to his desk , then back to the Post - its , over and over .
Mr. Abrams has worked for a mix of corporate clients that has included A.I.G. ( before its near collapse ) , Reynolds Tobacco and , for about 20 years , McGraw - Hill , which owns S.& P .
But media cases have made him the only First Amendment lawyer whom anyone outside the legal field can name .
( He is representing a New York Times reporter who was called before a grand jury , but he ’s no longer the paper ’s go - to counsel , he says , because his price is too high . )
He became nationally known in 1971 , at the age of 34 , after he beat back the Nixon administration when it tried to block The Times ’s series about a lengthy , secret account of the Vietnam War that had been drafted by the Pentagon .
The Pentagon Papers case , as it was known , arrived at a moment in history when the rights of journalists  to protect sources , to publish classified documents , and so on  were flimsy at best , and by helping to make those rights robust , he became a media darling .
He would go on to defend clients like the Brooklyn Museum , which Rudolph W. Giuliani , then the mayor of New York , tried to shut down in 1999 because he found a piece of art in it offensive .
Such fights have given Mr. Abrams the aura of a public - interest lawyer at large , an eminence who knows how to use the Constitution to deflect bullies .
There are legends in any field who coast on the fumes of early victories , but Mr. Abrams is n’t one of them , say law professors and fellow lawyers .
He is still known for his do n’t - give - an - inch approach to advocacy .
In the rating agency field , that has earned him some critics .
“ In my view , he has n’t done the industry much good because his tactics have been too aggressive , ” says Jerome S. Fons , a former Moody ’s managing director .
Mr. Fons has an example in mind : in 2004 , the S.E.C. proposed a voluntary regulatory framework for the rating agencies .
It never got much past the conceptual phase , and whatever it might have ultimately looked like , there ’s little reason to think it would have defused the planet - rattling bomb that rating agencies were helping to ignite in 2004 .
But Mr. Fons says he thinks that at minimum , the framework could have “ raised some red flags earlier , ” and if that had happened , who knows ?
Localizing Ubiquity : an open letter to linguists
Localizing Ubiquity : an open letter to linguists from mitcho on Vimeo .
Below is a transcript of this video .
Please distribute this video far and wide to anyone who may be interested . ^^
Dear linguist ,
My name is mitcho and I am currently involved with an exciting open source community project at Mozilla Labs called Ubiquity .
The project ’s goal is to empower the user to accomplish more on the web , and to do this , Ubiquity connects disparate services from across the web with language .
Let me show you what I mean .
Example 1
Suppose you ’re emailing a friend to tell them where to meet later .
It would be great if you could insert a map in your email , but you would regularly have to go to a maps application and insert a link .
But with Ubiquity installed , you can just pull up Ubiquity with a keystroke , enter map Shinjuku , pick the right result and rearrange it , and click “ insert map . ”
It ’s that simple .
Example 2
Let ’s say you ’ve stumbled upon an article in French and you want to send a bit of it to a friend .
Again , you could just send a link , but with Ubiquity we can do much better than that .
We ’ll first select the quote we want and translate it to English .
There we go .
Now I ’ll select the bit I actually want to send , pull up Ubiquity and execute email this to Aza .
Because Ubiquity interacts with my address book , it knows who I mean by “ Aza ” and composes my email for me .
As you can see , the Ubiquity interface makes it easy to accomplish tasks with minimal interruption to a user ’s workflow .
New verbs are easy to write and there ’s already an active community writing new verbs and sharing them with users .
The localization of Ubiquity
Right now Ubiquity offers a basic English parser and an experimental Japanese one , but Firefox itself currently ships with 55 distinct localizations .
We hope to localize Ubiquity into a number of these languages .
In order to accomplish this , we need support from viewers like you .
For each language — whether Basque , Polish , or Esperanto — we hope to build a parser to take the command and pick out its verb and the arguments and then identify the semantic roles of each argument .
Ubiquity will then apply the verb to those arguments and execute .
We ’ll need both data and expertise into the languages we hope to localize .
If you ’re a native speaker or researcher , what is the structure of commands in your language ?
How do you code for different kinds of arguments ?
What do your pronouns look like ?
We ’d love to see blog posts , discussions , or quick mockups on these and other topics .
For those of you with NLP experience , we ’d love to get more folks involved in writing these parsers .
And in the near future , we ’d appreciate anyone who wants to simply try out Ubiquity in their language and give us feedback .
The idea of using natural language to direct computers is far from new .
But in this limited context of individual commands — single imperative clauses without complexities such as negation or quantification — I believe there is great potential for Ubiquity to support other languages and bring this interface — this new way of interacting with the web — to more people in more communities .

* Space station scheduled to end in 2016
* Shuttle Discovery arrives with new lab gear for station
* Obama space review panel due to deliver report
CAPE CANAVERAL , Fla. , Aug 31 ( Reuters ) - Getting humans to Mars will require medical research on the International Space Station through at least 2020 , said the program 's lead scientist , presenting a time frame five years beyond NASA 's current budget forecast .
Extending the life of the station , a $ 100 billion project of 16 nations that is nearing completion after more than a decade of construction , was a surprise finding of the presidential panel reviewing the U.S. human space program .
The study team 's report was to be delivered to the White House this week but was not expected to be publicly disclosed until mid- to late - September .
The panel also said NASA 's $ 18 billion annual budget , about half of which is spent on human space projects , falls about $ 3 billion a year short for Constellation , the moon - and - beyond exploration initiative NASA plans after it retires the space shuttle and station programs .
" NASA needs the ISS , " program scientist Julie Robinson said .
" A six - month stay on the space station is going to be the best analog we 're ever going to have for a six - month microgravity transit to Mars in the future . "
Scientists looking to develop countermeasures for radiation exposure , bone loss and other effects of long - duration stays in space estimate they will need to keep the station operating until at least 2020 to ensure " that next step beyond low - Earth orbit ( will be ) a safe step for humankind , " Robinson said .
NASA plans to spend about $ 2.5 billion a year for space station operations through 2015 .
Ending it just five years after its completion would rankle U.S. partners Russia , Europe , Japan and Canada , which have invested heavily in the program and are looking for payoffs , members of the Human Space Flight Plans Committee said during public hearings .
Subcommittee chair Sally Ride , a former astronaut , said her group found widespread support for continuing , and even enhancing , the station program into 2016 and beyond .
" We did n't start off with that perspective , " Ride said .
" We do n't think that the deorbit of ISS in 2016 makes sense . "
While the NASA and the White House begin examining the panel 's recommendations , a 13 - member joint station - shuttle crew will soon begin unloading more than seven tons of new laboratory equipment , supplies and spare parts .
The shuttle Discovery and seven astronauts arrived at the space station on Sunday for a nine - day stay .
On Monday , the crew planned to attach the shuttle 's Italian - built cargo pod onto the station so it can be unpacked .
The container is packed with two new research facilities , a freezer , a spare oxygen generator , a second treadmill and a fifth berth for the station 's newly expanded six - person crew .
The last bedroom is scheduled to be flown to the outpost next year .
Discovery is due back at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Sept. 10 .

Ferrari will announce its sponsorship deal with Spanish banking giants Santander at Monza on Thursday , confirming a deal that was first revealed by AUTOSPORT in July last year .
Ferrari is to hold a press conference ahead of the Italian Grand Prix with Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo and the president of the Bank of Santander , Emilio Botin .
The Santander alliance comes amid continued speculation that Spaniard Fernando Alonso is also on his way to Ferrari , although it is not known if an announcement about the Maranello team 's 2010 driver plans will be made at Monza this weekend .
Ferrari has already stated that it is waiting for Felipe Massa to be fully fit for the start of next season , and it has a contract with Kimi Raikkonen too - although there is a chance this could be bought out .
Santander entered Formula 1 in 2007 with the McLaren team , on the back of its signing of Alonso , and its contract with the Woking - based team runs until the end of this year .

The IDF released Saturday a video showing the strike on three Islamic Jihad terrorists preparing to fire rockets at Israel .
All three terrorists were killed in the Friday night attack .
" The message is clear .
We will not allow the firing of rockets at Israel , and all means are kosher to that end , " a military official said of the strike , which featured IDF cooperation with the Shin Bet security service .
The video shows three figures getting out of their vehicle and preparing to fire rockets .
It also shows that the rocket prepared for launch exploded in midair .
The strike was the first one of its kind since the end of Operation Cast Lead in the Gaza Strip in January 2009 .
England 's unexpected victory against Sri Lanka on Friday has thrown Group B wide open , with all four teams in with a chance of making the semi-finals .
Here 's a look at what each of the four teams need to do to make the cut .
England
The win against Sri Lanka gives them some breathing space .
If England beat South Africa , they will surely get into the last four , regardless of other results .
On the other hand , if they lose the last two , they 'll definitely be out .
If England lose to South Africa and beat New Zealand , they 'll want New Zealand to beat Sri Lanka .
Else , three teams will be tied on four points ( while New Zealand will have zero ) , and net run-rates will come into play .
Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka are in a peculiar situation - they might make the semi-finals even if they lose to New Zealand , but on the other hand , they might miss out even if they beat New Zealand .
Here 's how : if they lose to New Zealand , and if England win their last two matches , then England will have three wins , while the other three teams will finish with one victory each , bringing in net run rates to decide on the second semi-finalist .
If Sri Lanka beat New Zealand , and if England lose to South Africa and beat New Zealand , three teams will again be tied , this time on six points , bringing run rates into play .
Sri Lanka 's best bet is to beat New Zealand , and then hope that England either win both their remaining matches , or lose them both .
South Africa
Like Sri Lanka , South Africa too depend on other results .
If they lose to England , they 'll have to hope New Zealand have beaten Sri Lanka but lose to England , so that England finish with three wins , while three teams battle for the second spot .
If South Africa beat England , and if England lose to New Zealand , then the home team will surely be through .
However , if South Africa win their last game , and New Zealand lose both their matches , then three teams will be tied on four points .
New Zealand
A defeat against Sri Lanka will knock them out of the tournament , regardless of other results in the group .
If they beat Sri Lanka , New Zealand can make it even if they lose to England , if South Africa lose their last game against England ( three teams on two points ; NRR comes into play ) .
If New Zealand win both their matches , they 'll definitely make the cut , along with the winner of the South Africa - England clash .
New Zealand and England are thus the two teams who can qualify without depending on other results .

The subject of this week 's technology law column ( Toronto Star version , homepage version ) is that previously unreported , however , is Industry Canada officials identified much the same problem and worked for years to develop an online tool to address it .
After spending tens of thousands of dollars creating and testing an online calculator designed to help consumers select their ideal wireless plan , Industry Minister Tony Clement killed the project weeks before it was scheduled to launch .
Government records suggest intense lobbying this spring by Canada ’s wireless companies , who feared the service would promote lower cost plans , played a key role in the decision .
The Office of Consumer Affairs ( OCA ) , a branch within Industry Canada with a mandate to promote and protect consumer interests , was the original source for Which Cell Plan ?
A Calculator .
The calculator asked consumers for detailed information about their current or anticipated cellphone use and then provided them with a detailed list of suitable plans from Canadian providers .
In 2008 , the OCA paid Decima Research almost $ 60,000 to conduct extensive usability testing .
The company conducted 12 two - hour focus group sessions in Halifax , Vancouver , and Montreal that included cellphone users as well as “ cellphone intenders ” – those expecting to purchase a cellphone within a year .
Decima Research ’s report noted “ participants felt being a consumer of cellphones is frustrating and difficult .
The service plans of different providers are difficult to compare because they are all different …
Secondary frustrations and challenges included the length and limitations of contracts , billing inaccuracies , and quality of service issues such as dropped calls and coverage . ”
The focus groups ’ response to the cellphone cost calculator was positive , with the vast majority of participants indicating they would use the tool and encourage friends and family to do the same .
Yet just as Industry Canada was set to launch the tool , the major wireless carriers began lobbying against it .
According to lobbyist registration records , the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association and Bell Canada met with officials from Clement ’s office on April 8th , with the association listing telecommunications regulation and consumer issues as the topics of discussion .
Two weeks later , Telus also met with the same officials to discuss consumer issues .
The carriers were apparently concerned that the tool only covered voice services and that it was geared toward lower - priced plans .
Sensing that Clement was facing pressure to block the calculator , Canadian consumer groups wrote to the Minister , urging him to stick with it .
Despite months of preparation , thousands of dollars in taxpayer expense , the creation of an effective tool , and the obvious benefits for lower income Canadians , Clement nevertheless killed the project .
Given the tool ’s potential to encourage more Canadians to adopt wireless services , the decision ironically came just as Clement was meeting with technology executives in an effort to kick - start a national digital agenda .
According to an Industry Canada spokesperson , “ technical limitations ” were to blame .
With public dollars having funded the mothballed project , the government should now consider releasing the calculator ’s source code and enable other groups to pick up where the OCA left off .
In the meantime , Industry Canada has posted a cellphone checklist that asks consumers many of the same questions , but does not provide any information on carrier plans or pricing .
Update : CBC.ca covers this story with comments from Industry Canada , PIAC , the CWTA , and Bell .
Note that Bell indicates that they did not have a separate meetings on the issue and let the CWTA handle the issue on their behalf .
The CWTA reaffirms its support for killing the calculator .
Update II : Catherine Middleton points out the FCC is asking questions about similar consumer disclosures and cost comparisons .

One People 's Project has the full - length version of this video , taken from the big 912 rally in Washington , D.C. , showing a middle - aged white man and his Asian wife chasing after and harassing a trio of black people -- primarily two teenagers and an adult guardian ( possibly their mother ) who were selling " Do n't Tread on Me " flags along the long grassy mall .
As you can see , the man -- who identifies himself as Tim Jones -- shouts after them : " ACORN !
These people are ACORN !!!
They are frauds !!!
ACORN is fraud !!!
Obama sucks !
This woman sells signs for profit of ACORN !! "
It attracts more harassers , and it verges on the point of an outbreak of violence when the D.C. bicycle police show up and break up the scene .
Now , how does Jones claim to know that they are actually ACORN workers ?
He says he overheard a police officer ask them if they were selling for ACORN and the young woman -- who appears to be a young teen -- told the cop " yes . "
The older woman tells him flatly they 're not from ACORN , but he keeps shouting it anyway .
Most of all , Jones and his wife are harassing these people based on some shaky presuppositions : that a young teenage girl would answer a cop 's question -- particularly the addition of the ACORN element -- accurately is probably the shakiest , but toss in the fact that " off brand " vendors , people who have nothing whatsoever to do with a political entity like ACORN , employing young African Americans often flock to these political events and sell whatever is selling in terms of hats , T - shirts , pins , flags , and whatever gewgaws can be sold .
Cops regularly chase them off if they do n't have a license .
Which is probably what these people were doing , and why they fled .
Well , that and the fear of being lynched by these maniacs .
The bigger question is :
Why target African Americans when there are are hundreds of vendors at these things ?
And why assume that they have anything to do with ACORN ?
Because , to the teabaggers , ACORN is synonymous with scary black people .
The kind who , in the minds of Glenn Beck and his followers , are lurking , waiting to overthrow America when Obama orders them to .
( Even if they later turn out to be a dance troupe . )
As Susie says , ACORN is just the new wingnutspeak code for the ' N ' word .
It 's now become an epithet -- one you can chase black people around with and accuse them angrily .
Just what America needs right now .

D. Michael Quinn is a historian of Mormonism and former Brigham Young University professor who was excommunicated from the LDS Church in 1993 , after publishing research into controversial subjects in church history .
In this interview , Quinn describes his excommunication and the difficulties faced by gay Mormons .
He also explains how his personal experiences of revelation have preserved his belief in Mormon doctrine , despite his conflicts with the church .
This is the edited transcript of an interview conducted on Jan. 6 , 2006 .
How did the church move into the 20th century and become a success story ?
After the surrender of polygamy in the 1890s , the LDS Church began a rigorous process of conforming to the expectations of American society .
There are some tremendous reversals in that , where individuals came back into power in a way that changed the directions of the LDS Church .
One of them was Lorenzo Snow .
He had been imprisoned as a polygamist in the 1880s .
He became president of the LDS Church in 1898 and immediately began to emphasize a tithing , requiring 10 percent of one 's income to the LDS Church .
...
Diplomats began coming through Salt Lake because it was a hub for the railroad , and he began this process of diplomatic outreach , not only to people from other countries , but also within the United States .
By the tithing emphasis that he made , he brought the LDS Church out of its near - destruction financially by encouraging this sacrifice on the part of LDS Church membership .
As an individual he inspired a kind of confidence , because he was such a kindly looking , old patriarch - looking Abraham kind of figure .
It brought a greater kind of confidence on the part of the leadership of the secular world .
Another reversal occurred with Reed Smoot .
Reed Smoot had come close to being ejected from the Senate in this process of investigating him from 1903 to 1907 .
He survived that , but just did n't merely survive .
He was an astute businessman .
He was a very , very clever politician , and over a period of time in the Senate he became the most influential member of the U.S. Senate .
He became the kingmaker for the U.S. presidency in a sense , because he was the one who decided at the Republican National Convention who was going to be the candidate , and during this time of Republican supremacy in the 1920s , the candidate was the president .
When the men were elected whom Smoot had helped choose , they offered him a position in the Cabinet .
He would say , " No , I 'm more powerful and needed in the Senate , but here are some men I recommend for the Cabinet . "
So he became kingmaker for the presidency [ and ] he became kingmaker for the Cabinet under three different presidents of the United States in the 1920s .
...
“ I was fulfilling my mission as I felt that God had led me to , and yet it had put me on a collision course with the leadership of the church I regarded as his prophets . ”
Then , joined with Reed Smoot was another reversal story , and that is Heber J. Grant .
Heber J. Grant had been a young polygamist who had been hiding from arrest during most of his early years as an apostle , but he was an astute businessman and ... was able to bring about , through his connections with non-Mormon businessmen in New York City , Boston and Chicago , a connection so powerful -- and it was primarily a personal interaction with them , a building of trust , handshakes that made deals .
When the depression of 1893 hit the nation , he , through these contacts , saved the LDS Church from financial ruin .
Then in the 1920s , ... Reed Smoot is joined in the business activities with Heber J. Grant , who has maintained these business contacts , has built them , and to the degree that he has the United States seeing the Mormon Church and its business power as a good thing , no longer as a bad thing , and he helps to move the LDS Church into sugar industry , into communications , into hotels , into insurance , into this diversified sector of influence , first regionally and then nationally , so that it not only has built up friends in the financial centers of the United States ; it has built up actual influence , so that the LDS Church becomes perceived as American .
As American as all the big- business emphasis of the 1920s perceived the community of businessmen , the LDS Church was very much a part of that , and Heber J. Grant is central to that .
He does financially and in the business realm what Reed Smoot does in the political realm in making Americans see the Mormons as not only American , but as influential and as people we want as friends .
...
How did the church grow so fast and what kind of pressure came along with that ?
Well , this was a terrible thing .
I was a missionary , and my experience is true of all LDS missionaries .
You 're separated from your family , very often for the first time in your life .
You 're in an unusual environment .
...
And then to be put under the situation that if you 're really going to please your mission president , who 's your kind of substitute father , you 've got to come up with high numbers of baptisms .
...
Missionaries just threw ethics to the wind , and they did whatever was necessary to do to please their mission presidents .
...
When was this and what was the scope of the problem ?
This period of tremendous growth , coupled with missionary abuses because of the pressures put on them , was happening during the period basically from about 1953 to 1960 , and it was happening throughout the world .
...
One of my missionary friends in England came to me one time when I was talking negatively about baseball baptisms , and he said , " Well , you know , I 'm a baseball baptism .
But , " he said , " in Louisiana we called it beach baptisms . " ...
The missionaries would come to them in these backcountry areas and say : " We 'll take you to the ocean .
You 've never seen the ocean before .
The LDS Church will pay for us to take you to the ocean so you can have a beach trip .
Tell all your friends above the age of 8 to come on this trip . "
They'd hire these buses , and they would drive the hours necessary to get from the hills of Mississippi or Alabama or Louisiana down to the beaches .
Then when they were down into the beaches , these missionaries would dunk these kids into the surf , and the kids thought they were just playing .
Then the missionaries would be writing down names and keeping records , and as the kids were going back during the several - hour trip , then the missionaries were talking about religion , and they found out that they were members of the church .
...
The mission presidents were in competition with each mission to get the highest numbers of mission baptisms .
Then every missionary within a mission was put under this kind of pressure , and it resulted in these worldwide abuses .
...
You were asked to excommunicate youngsters who had been brought into the church .
Describe that process and its ultimate effect on you .
...
The president of the church , David O. McKay , sent over someone who was known as a troubleshooter in the LDS Church , an apostle named Mark E. Peterson , and he was given a responsibility over all of the missionary work in the British Isles , as well as the western part of France , Belgium and the Netherlands .
He began to investigate what had happened .
...
As a missionary I went around and had lists of nonparticipating members given to me by the branch presidents or the bishops .
We would go out and knock on doors and contact these people .
I found kids who in some cases had joined just because they liked the missionaries , and they knew they were joining a church , but they were n't that interested in the church .
... I found others of these teenage boys , some of them only 12 and 13 years of age , who had been baptized five years or more before , and they did n't even know that they were members of a church .
They thought they 'd been initiated into a baseball club .
I found some of them who , I asked them what their ages were , and they had been baptized when they were 6 or 7 years of age , which is illegal under Mormon regulations of baptism .
It has to be the age of 8 .
The missionaries had forged their birthdates .
...
It was a very depressing kind of experience .
...
The second stage of this process was to excommunicate or to fellowship , to bring into activity those who were interested in doing so , and for those who were not , for them to be excommunicated .
It turned out that I was assigned to be a branch president .
... I was 20 years old , and I was a branch president ... over a branch that had collapsed .
There were 125 members of the branch ; there were three or four active members of the LDS Church .
I was facing the prospect of excommunicating more than 100 people from the LDS Church , and I 'd only baptized four .
I got through enough courts to excommunicate about 14 people , which was three or four times the number I 'd baptized , and this demoralized me .
I ended up in a spiritual crisis .
... I lost my faith .
...
I was in a situation that was impossible for me , because I had been this ardent believer ever since childhood , had had many metaphysical experiences , healing experiences .
I still remembered them , but they did n't matter to me , because I had this abject doubt .
I just did n't believe in anything at that point , and I knew that I could not stay as a missionary .
I did not confide in anybody , because I was afraid to .
But after my mission companion went to sleep at night , I would go off into a room or a hallway or a bathroom where I could be alone , and I would pray out loud : " Oh , God , if there is a God , help me to know it again . " ...
I gave myself a few weeks , and that if I did n't resolve it and regain my testimony in a few weeks , then I was going to tell the mission president I had to go home , which in Mormon culture is a huge humiliation , to leave your mission early .
And what could I say to people ? ...
Well , in the process of about a month period , I finally regained those spiritual feelings , that burning within that [ St . ]
Bernard [ of ]
Clairvaux , as a medieval mystic , had described , and faith returned .
I no longer had to pray , " Oh , God , if there is a God . "
I knew again , within the center of my being , that God lived .
...
What was the pressure on the Mormons in the mission who did n't have that certainty ?
How did you counsel them until you had your own crisis of faith ?
Part of the instruction that Mormons get from an early age is to be able to say , " I know the church is true , I know that God lives , I know that Jesus is the Christ . " ...
It 's perceived as a lack of faith if you use the words " I believe , " if you do n't say the words " I know . " ...
I was a baptizing missionary and spoke well , and eventually I was advanced to leadership positions in the mission .
Missionaries would come to me for counsel about various things , about teaching and whatever .
But these were like a confessional , because missionaries would come to me , and many of them , with tears in their eyes , and these young men in their 20s -- 19 to 20 , 21 years of age -- tears streaming down their faces , saying , " I do n't have a testimony , and I do n't know what 's wrong . "
They would say : " Tell me , how do you know ?
How can you say that you know ? "
It was n't a challenge ; it was begging to know what they could do to gain the kind of testimony that I had .
And they would say to me [ that ] they had prayed and they had fasted , and some of them were fasting two and three times a week , two or three days without any food or water , trying to gain this inward testimony .
...
They were just brokenhearted , because they had done everything that they had been taught to do , and they did not have faith , and it was just killing them .
...
Because of my own crisis of faith , I knew what it was like to pray and to feel like there was nothing there .
I would just say to them : " I do n't know the answer for you .
All I can tell you is that I think faith is a gift , and I 've had it most of my life , although I 've had a period of doubt .
But my testimony is that God is real , and that he loves you , and I hope that you will learn that .
It breaks my heart that you 've made this effort and you do n't feel that confidence . "
So I was n't able to help them , except not to condemn them .
...
For Mormons who do n't have that faith , it 's very difficult for them to admit that they do n't , because the initial answer that they 're going to get is : " Well , you 're not trying hard enough .
You 're not praying hard enough .
You 're not reading the Scriptures .
You must be having evil thoughts .
What are you doing in your life that does n't allow the spirit to enter your heart ? "
It 's a huge guilt trip for somebody who has difficulty or impossibility of being able to say , with honesty , " I know . " ...
Psychologically [ the mission seems to be ] a searing rite of passage .
Why ?
...
When you become an LDS missionary , you have a companion who is assigned to you 24 hours a day .
You never leave the sight of that companion except to go to the bathroom .
You are with that person 24 hours a day , and you are told to tell that missionary companion that you love him , or if you 're a female companion with a lady missionary that you love her .
Missionary life is even described as being like a marriage .
I was told as a missionary , " You will never be as close with your wife as you will be your missionary companion , " which was irony , because I was a gay male .
But all missionaries are told this , because they said very frankly , the missionary leaders would say , you will never be with your wife 24 hours a day .
If you 're a woman , you will never be with your husband 24 hours a day , day in , day out , for two years of your life , but you are with these missionary companions .
Then you not only have this bonding experience that is so intense ; your life is utterly controlled by the missionary experience .
You do n't do anything unless it is approved for you as a missionary .
If it is n't approved to listen to radio , you do not listen to radio .
If it is n't approved to watch television , you do not watch television .
If it is n't approved to read a newspaper , you will not read a newspaper .
You follow the rules for this two - year period .
There is nothing in the contemporary experience of 20 - year - olds in America and Canada to compare with this .
The only thing that would be close to it would be going into a seminary , a young man who takes the position of having a calling to become a priest .
That 's the only thing that would be similar to it .
Yet in the Mormon experience , it 's this two - year , temporary experience .
After two years it 's over , and these young men and women are expected to go back to a normal life , and it 's difficult because they have experienced something utterly alien to the contemporary civilian life that they go back to .
...
You feel , this is n't real .
What 's real was the missionary experience .
It is n't real for me to be in college again ; it is n't real for me to be working ; it is n't real for me to be trying to date .
What 's real is serving God 24 hours a day , sharing the message of the Gospel .
And it is this searing , overwhelming experience that usually lasts for two years that every missionary will look back on and very often say , " There were a lot of hard times as a missionary , but this was the best two years of my life . " ...
What were some moments where you experienced God and how did that become a foundation of your faith ?
Well , from childhood , whenever I would think about God or pray , I would feel this burning feeling and sensation within me .
No one had told me about it ; it was just something I felt and I experienced .
I remember my shock when I was a teenager and read a description of this in Mormon Scripture , and I was stunned that other people were experiencing it .
...
But for me , I can't point to an earliest point in my life where I knew God .
I have always known him as a friend , as a companion .
In my prayers I talked with him as if he were my father .
But I can remember one incident , when I was 9 ; it was one of my more metaphysical experiences .
I was with my family taking a tour of subterranean caves , and they at one point had a demonstration of what blackness was like .
So they turned out the klieg lights that they had illuminating this subterranean cave .
Well , I had gotten behind the group , because I was curious and looking at stalactites , and that all was very interesting to me .
...
So I could hear the voice of the tour guide droning on about what this meant , in pitch black and all of that .
So I was walking toward the voice , the direction of this droning voice of the tour guide .
All of a sudden I heard another voice that said , " Stop . "
I hesitated for a moment , and then I started taking another step .
And this voice came to me so powerfully and said , " Stop , my son . "
And I felt , this is the voice of God , but I do n't know why .
So I stopped and I waited , and that was it .
There was another couple of minutes where the voice of the tour guide was droning on , and then he said , " Now turn on the lights . "
The lights went back on , and I was at the edge of a precipice .
I had thought I 'd been walking toward the voice of the tour guide , and because of the echoing I had been walking at an angle , some angle , and another step and I would have gone right off this precipice .
... I was just inches from the edge .
And I firmly believe , my testimony is that was the voice of God , to me .
... I 've had many healing experiences which people could say , " Oh , well , you recovered , or you were preserved from death , but it was just the circumstances . "
I acknowledge that that 's a legitimate way of perceiving it , even though I see it as God 's intervention in healing me or in preserving me from dying in various accidents that I was in .
But this experience in the caves was for me a pivotal one , because at the time , I testified as a 9 - year - old boy in my board testimony meeting [ that ]
I heard the voice of God , and I still feel that .
You were excommunicated .
What happened , why did it happen , and how did you feel ?
For a believing Mormon , one who sees Mormonism as the true church and believes in the priesthood and the revelations that have been published , Mormonism is their whole life .
All their hope , all of their anticipation is connected with that .
Now , to be deprived of membership in the LDS Church is to lose all of that .
And for a Mormon who is an ardent believer , that is a kind of death .
...
When I began facing that potential , I was on the faculty of Brigham Young University , and what threw me into the jeopardy of losing my membership in the church were my publications on LDS history .
I was fulfilling what I believed was God 's mission for me : to understand the leadership of the church and the history of the church as well as I could , and to present it as honestly I could with the perspective that my training gave me so that members of the church would n't be disturbed when they learned about these problem areas , because anti-Mormons were using history as a club to beat the faith out of people .
I felt this would n't be possible if they already knew about these problems .
...
I felt earnestly that this was what God had prepared me to do , to present these problem areas in a context that allowed for faith and still acknowledged what the anti-Mormons or the critics would bring up , but to say : " Yeah ?
So what ?
These are human beings . "
God works with fallible human beings , whether they 're your parents or your prophets .
This is a way of understanding it and maintaining faith .
Well , the problem was that -- well , actually , it was a double problem .
I was getting reports back from people who had read and heard the things that I 'd say that that , in fact , was how they were understanding it .
They were saying : " Oh , thank you .
This makes it understandable for me . " ...
On the other hand , I was hearing officially from apostles , whom I regarded as God 's chosen prophets and apostles on earth , that this kind of approach to history was not faith - promoting ; that it was contrary to what God wanted .
...
What specifically were you writing about that was particularly problematic ?
The things that I was learning that were not pleasing to the leaders of the church that I had been publishing about were policy changes in the LDS Church ; the existence of certain councils , such as a theocratic Council of Fifty that I published about that the LDS Church leaders did n't know about themselves , and if they did know about , they did n't want rank and file to know that there was a theocracy that was a part of Mormonism ; polygamy , and the practice of polygamy after the Manifesto , that had been secretly practiced or practiced by Joseph Smith before it was publicly announced in 1852 as a doctrine of the LDS Church .
These kinds of things , policy changes and doctrinal changes , were things that I had written about and had tried to put into a context of seeing this as a process of change and a process of revelation , but nonetheless to acknowledge that there were these problem areas , but they did n't need to be problem areas .
They could be understood as a part of the human experience or as a part of God 's changing patterns of dealing with the LDS Church , or as a part of the LDS Church responding to differing circumstances .
But it became clear that criticisms from apostles of the LDS Church -- Mark E. Peterson , Boyd K. Packer , [ Ezra Taft ] Benson -- were being directed directly at the kinds of things I was publishing , and in some cases , by title , at some of these publications of mine .
It became clear to me , when I published a long article , almost 100 pages , about plural marriage after the Manifesto , that this was coming to a breaking point between me and the church , because my local LDS Church president , the stake president , was visited by a General Authority and told that I was to be called in and punished , and that at a minimum I was to lose my temple recommend , which was the basis for church employment , and I was a professor at BYU .
Then the leader of this meeting said , " And if this does n't keep him from doing this kind of thing , you should take further action as appropriate . "
And he started to get up and walk out .
He thought that was the end of it .
And the stake president said , " Now , wait a minute . "
He said : " Michael Quinn gave me a copy of this article on plural marriage after the Manifesto .
I and my counselors have read it , and we do n't find anything in it that is contrary to faith .
It talks about some difficult experiences the church went through , but we do n't see this as a reason to punish him .
...
And he has n't done this secretly , and we do n't see -- we 've read it . "
And they asked , " Have you read it ? "
And he said , " No , I would n't read anti-Mormon trash . "
And they said , " Well , how can you judge that what he 's written is destructive of the faith if you have n't read it ? "
And it went around and around , and finally after two and a half hours , the stake president said , " Well , I 'll call Michael Quinn in , and I will explain to him what you have said to us , and then we 'll go from there . "
And this representative said : " Oh , no .
You can't tell him that I told you what I 've told you .
You can't tell him that this came from church headquarters .
This has to be your objection that he is to be informed of , that you have objected to , and that you 're going to punish him for . "
And the stake president said : " I 'm not going to lie to him , so you decide :
Am I going to tell him the truth and call him in , or am I not going to say anything to him ?
Because I am not going to lie to him . "
This stunned this General Authority who had been sent from church headquarters , and he said , " Well , then you do [ what ] you feel you need to do . "
So the stake president called me in and explained this whole process , including the fact that he had been told to lie to me and to say that this was his personal objection to what I 'd published .
The stake president said : " I feel obligated to do something .
I have to do something . "
And he said : " I 'm taking your temple recommend .
You will not be able to go back to the temple without it .
But , " he said , " I 'm afraid that they 're going to use this as a grounds for firing you from BYU if you do not have temple recommend .
So , " he says , " if anyone at BYU asks if you have a valid temple recommend , you tell them yes , and do n't volunteer that it 's in my desk drawer .
And when it expires , I 'll renew it , but I 'll keep it in my desk drawer . "
And I knew at that moment that I was dead meat , that as long as that stake president was there to protect me I would be protected , but as soon as he was relieved of his position -- and these are temporary positions ; it 's a lay ministry -- and another stake president who was more compliant was in the position , or if I happened to move ... out of his stake , then I was dead meat .
...
I was fulfilling my mission as I felt that God had led me to , and yet it had put me on a collision course with the leadership of the church I regarded as his prophets .
...
So I prayed a lot to God : " Help me to know .
If I 'm wrong , I 'll confess that I 'm wrong .
If you want me to stop my research as a Mormon historian , I will . " ...
And I received the confirmation that I had received since childhood of God 's presence , of this burning within , of this sense of peace which , as Jesus says , passes all understanding .
I felt that I was doing nothing wrong in what I published and that they were wrong in condemning me for it .
I could n't sort this out .
It did n't make any sense to me , but I felt there was no way I was going to retreat , no matter what it required , and eventually it ended up in my excommunication .
Do you remember the day you got the letter ?
Well , it was a long process .
... I do remember .
It was in February .
I was deadly ill with a flu , and I was a week away from going to California for a fellowship at the Huntington Library that would last for several months .
On this Sunday morning , there was a knock at my door , and I had a fever of about 102 .
I dragged myself up , went to the door , and there was the stake president .
I had never seen him before .
... I had been trying to stay under the radar , because I knew that they were after me , and I did not want to deal with that confrontation .
But he said , " We have reports that you have published and spoken in ways of an apostate , and we need to talk with you . "
He started to walk in the door , and I closed the door , and I just said : " I am sick as a dog .
I can not let you in .
You can not come in .
And I 'm leaving for California in just a few days .
As soon as I get well enough to drive , I 'm going down .
I wo n't be back for months . "
So I said , " We 're going to have to have this conversation some other time . "
I said goodbye , and I went back to bed , fell asleep .
Barely into REM sleep , and there was another knock at the door , and then the doorbell began ringing .
It woke me up , and I walked to the door again , and there was the stake president .
...
He said , " Can I come in ? "
He started walking in , like missionaries do , you know , best foot forward .
And I said : " No , I 'm still sick as a dog .
It 's only been an hour , and you cannot come in . "
And he said : " Well , I have a letter for you .
You must read this letter , and I want you to respond to this letter . "
So I said , " Fine , I 'll read it when I feel well enough . "
I closed the door , and I put the letter down , and a few hours later , when I woke up from my feverish state and was well enough to read the letter , I read it .
It said that I had been guilty of apostasy , and it outlined three evidences of my apostasy , and two of them were publications that I had written , and one of them was my statement to The New York Times that compared the 20th - century leadership to the 19th - century leadership , and I said in the 19th - century leadership that the LDS leaders acknowledged the existence of a loyal opposition .
They did n't like to have dissenters , but they acknowledged that one could be loyal and also disagree with the leadership .
But , I said , in the 20th century , they do n't acknowledge the existence of a loyal opposition , and they often take church measures against them .
That was the third example of my apostasy , which shows that the leadership today has no sense of irony .
But that was the time when I saw it in black and white , where I was accused of apostasy .
How did you respond when you read the letter ?
Had you been expecting it , or were you still incredulous ?
No , I was expecting it , and I was mad as hell .
...
It was like the old line from the movie [ Network ] : I 'm mad as hell , and I 'm not going to take this anymore ! "
I had never , prior to that , gone to the media .
I had been quoted a lot , including [ in ] Newsweek and Time magazine , The New York Times , but it was always when the media came to me .
...
Well , this time I went to the media , and I produced for the local newspaper , The Salt Lake Tribune , a photocopy of this letter from the stake president so that they would see , and they ran articles : " Mormon historian being pursued . "
And this ended up as an AP [ Associated Press ] story .
It was published in the Los Angeles Times before I got down to Los Angeles for this fellowship that I had at the Huntington Library .
...
I had hoped that the prospect of this being a black eye in public relations would make them back off , and they would tell the stake president , who I was sure was under orders because of my previous experience , that they would say , " Oh , well , on second thought , leave him alone ; let him do his thing . "
But that 's not what happened , and eventually I was excommunicated .
[ How did you feel ? ]
I was angry when I got the letter , but it 's like family .
You get angry at families , but you do n't abandon the family , and you do n't want the family to abandon you .
And so the fact that I felt anger did n't affect my sense that this is a true church .
...
And I 'm angry at what they 're doing .
These are prophets , seers and revelators , but I believe they 're wrong .
And I believe it's my right as a believing Latter - day Saint to say they 're wrong , but also to say : " I acknowledge that they 're God 's prophets , seers and revelators .
I just think you 've made a mistake . "
So that 's how I approached it , and when push came to shove and shove came to being excommunicated , it was like death ; it really was .
...
[ Would you like to be invited back into the church ? ]
I would have to say with a big if , and that is , if you stop using political power as a club against gays and lesbians .
I can not be silent about policies that I disagree with .
That is the one great freedom that my excommunication has given me , because even though people thought I spoke up any time I chose , I really remained silent about deep disagreements with church policies during the ERA [ Equal Rights Amendment ] campaign of the LDS Church .
I was on the faculty at BYU .
I never spoke against it ; I never wrote against it , even though I felt utterly that it was wrong .
I 'm not going to go back into that closet of being a silent dissenter .
So no , I could not accept an invitation to join the LDS Church again , because so many of its current policies are contrary to what I believe is the will of God .
As a gay man , what are the special difficulties that you see for gays in the Mormon Church ?
...
In a society that does n't accept homosexuality , ... everyone feels like they 're alone and lonely , and they have to hide .
But in Mormon culture it 's worse because of the theology of the family .
...
You have the opportunity of being together as a family forever if you are righteous enough , so Mormons live this frenetic life of doing and behaving in any way that the Scriptures or the leaders of the church tell them to , because they want this family unit to continue forever .
Well , when you 're gay you realize you do n't fit that picture .
And when you come out to your parents as gay , their fear is indescribable , because it 's not just that they 've lost their image of you in terms of this heterosexual perception they have of you .
Their fear is beyond the fear of other parents , because their fear is that they have the opportunity of having you with them for eternity , and now they 've lost it because you are a disgusting homosexual , and nothing disgusting can be in the presence of God .
You think there 's a special pain in Mormon families as they confront this .
... I 'll have to say that I 'm an exception to this in some ways , because the intensity of my relationship with God since childhood never caused me to doubt the eternal life with him .
Even though I knew that my family found " fairies " disgusting , as they told me , and friends would say that , and I heard this over the pulpit , I never doubted my relationship with God .
I knew that God accepted me as queer .
I just knew that .
I knew that he loved me .
I never feared his rejection .
But the thing I could n't live with was the rejection of family and friends here on earth .
...
Do you see an irony here in that the jewel in the crown of Mormonism is the family , yet on the issue of homosexuality , they break up families ?
... LDS families are in this double bind , because they 're told when they have gay children , follow that which is true .
Avoid even the appearance of evil , and homosexuality is evil .
So there has been almost a kind of expectation that if your child will not conform , then you should abandon them .
...
And yet many families find this extremely difficult to do -- not only the physical abandonment , but to give up the faith that this child , this homosexual child , and maybe his partner or her partner for life , may want to be with that family eternally .
It creates this huge faith disjunction .
...
You have to develop a private faith , which I have , that God accepts all loving relationships .
But this separates you from the orthodoxy of the Mormon Church , and many gays and lesbians cannot make that step .
They accept themselves as inferior eternally , because they 've never been taught otherwise , and they do n't have the individual testimony that I do .
Maybe I 'm wrong , but this is my faith .
So for the mass of Mormon families this is an unresolvable tragedy .
What were your confrontations with Boyd Packer about your different views on history and faith - producing history ?
When I was admitted to the faculty of Brigham Young University , I had the same kind of interview that all prospective faculty members have , and that is that a General Authority of the LDS Church meets with the prospective faculty member .
...
The person who interviewed me was apostle Boyd K. Packer .
We were together about 45 minutes , and almost all of that was a lecture .
He began by asking me what position I was going to be hired in or was being considered for , and I said it was as a professor in the history department .
The very next words out of his mouth were -- and I 'm not exaggerating ; these were seared into my memory -- Elder Packer said , " I have a hard time with historians , because historians idolize the truth . "
I almost sunk into my chair .
I mean , that statement just bowled me over .
Then he went on to say , quoting him as accurately as I can ... : " The truth is not uplifting .
The truth destroys .
And historians should tell only that part of the truth that is uplifting , and if it 's religious history , that 's faith - promoting . "
And he said , " Historians do n't like doing that , and that 's why I have a hard time with historians . "
And the conversation just went from there .
He occasionally would give me the opportunity to respond to what he was saying , and I would talk about putting things in context , and that one could deal with a controversy or a sensitive area , or even a negative experience in the past , but put it into context .
I said that it 's a question of do you talk about this in a sentence , a paragraph , a page , or do you just have a footnote reference to it ?
And I said , " That 's a decision that each individual historian will make , but , " I said , " I cannot agree with the idea that I should conceal this evidence . "
And he just shook his head , and he said , " You 're wrong , " ... and he went back to what he had started with to begin with .
...
With due credit to Elder Packer , even though it was clear in that interview that I had with him that we were at polar opposites on this issue of dealing with uncomfortable evidence in the past , I got the job in the department of history at Brigham Young University and I eventually was advanced to full professor , even though there were criticisms from him , privately and publicly , about the kind of history that I was doing .
So you have to give him that credit , that he did not intervene to prevent my being hired ; he did not intervene to prevent my being given tenure or being advanced to full professor .
What was that famous quote of his about the three dangers of the church ?
What was the importance of that statement ?
At one point Boyd Packer , as one of the senior members of the Quorum of the Twelve [ Apostles ] at that point , gave instruction , in 1993 I believe , to a group of church leaders at the annual world conference of the LDS Church , and he instructed them that there were three dangers that the church faced .
The three were the feminists , the gay and lesbians , and of course the ever - present problem of intellectuals and scholars , and that 's how he phrased it .
I lost on all three counts .
...
Is there a tighter leash now ?
...
One of the downsides of the massive growth of the LDS Church since the 1960s has been an inward concern about maintaining control , because the massive growth has caused the leadership to worry that the growth will mean a lessening of control , a lessening of what they see as the purity of the LDS Church .
They are concerned and worried that the LDS Church could be subject to the same problems as early Christianity .
...
The result of that has been on the Correlation program , which took away all of the independence of the lesson manuals , of the church magazines , so that everything has been controlled , dictated , approved in advance by the committees at the headquarters of the church .
Another has been taking away all of the independence that existed in missionary life .
Although there was a certain kind of uniform expectation of what missionaries would experience , this evaporated as mission presidents were instructed that every mission should be operated under the same rules , and every missionary was to have the same kind of experience , no matter where they were throughout the world .
...
BYU had been , for students during my experience there , a very freewheeling kind of experience .
I had a great experience as an independent student , as an undergraduate at BYU .
But after my experience there in the 1970s , increasingly to the present , there has been an effort to control the entire experience of students at BYU so that there is very little that a student can go there for if they do n't expect to fit a mold .
...
So conformity has become almost a watchword among the leaders as well as the rank and file in a way that never was true of Mormon experience prior to the 1960s .
This has had an effect on independent thinking ; it 's had an effect in independent expressions of academics .
And it has resulted in a kind of watchdog mentality , which even has a committee that is specifically assigned to look for any evidences of departures from orthodoxy or criticism by members of the church , especially if they 're academics .
This is a strengthening - of - the - members committee , which keeps files on anyone who publishes , writes letters to the editor in newspapers anywhere in the English - speaking world in particular .
This kind of inward paranoia has led to the disciplining of those who have been perceived as departing from the expectations of headquarters , and I 'm one of the examples of that , for publishing historical issues that were regarded as contrary to what the leadership wanted the rank and file to know .
Caster Semenya , the 18 - year - old South African runner who is sweeping the competition , is too good to be a real woman .
And look at all the muscle !
She must be a he !
So concerned about an unfair gender advantage , the International Association of Athletics Federations forced Semenya to take a DNA test to prove she ’s really a lady .
What ’d the results show ?
Nothing , yet !
The results wo n’t be in for several weeks , apparently .
And until there ’s any evidence to show that Semenya ( pictured , leaping over the other gal ) is actually a guy , she ’ll be able to compete .
Like she ’s doing tonight in Berlin .
And if Semenya really is a guy ?
Well , at least she ’s hiding her package better than Lady Gaga .
At least her coach is being a good sport over the controversy :
By ACS International Schools
Summary : New survey examines UK admissions officers views of the post - 16 qualifications on offer in the United Kingdom and highlights university application concerns
New survey examines UK admissions officers views of the post - 16 qualifications on offer in the United Kingdom and highlights university application concerns .
Pressure on pupils and teachers is forcing out independent thinking and creativity , the qualities most prized by universities .
International Baccalaureate ( IB ) Diploma is the most highly valued post - 16 qualification and should be available in more state schools .
IB scoring system is not fully understood by some universities and unfair demands may be made on IB students as a consequence .
Quality of most careers advice for sixth formers is ' indifferent ' .
The International Baccalaureate ( IB ) Diploma remains the most highly - regarded post 16 - qualification among UK university admissions officers .
The combination of qualities developed by the IB Diploma , including self management and creativity , are some of the factors which explain why the IB Diploma is considered an excellent preparation for university - style learning .
In particular , 62 per cent of admissions officers claim that the IB develops self - management skills , as compared to just 39 per cent who feel that this is a quality nurtured by A levels ( the qualification followed by the majority of post - 16 students in the UK ) .
The fourth annual survey of university admissions officers , commissioned by ACS International Schools , found that almost three quarters , 73 per cent , of admissions officers want to see the IB on offer in more state schools , almost two years after state funding for this independent qualification was withdrawn .
University admissions officers recognise the academic rigour of the IB Diploma with just one per cent of IB students awarded the top score of 45 points each year : 78 per cent of admissions officers say that it is harder to achieve the top IB Diploma score than it is to achieve top scores in A levels .
Significant misunderstandings occur however when comparing mid-range IB Diploma scores with A - level scores using the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service ( UCAS ) tariff system .
Almost two thirds , 60 per cent , of admissions officers misjudge the IB Diploma score and place the equivalent of four grade
Bs at A level from an IB student alongside just three Bs from an A level applicant .
While UCAS provides clear guidance on the scoring system and officers may refer to this information before making offers , this level of misunderstanding will nonetheless be of concern to IB students in the United Kingdom who plan to continue their studies at UK universities .
The study also looked into admissions officers views on other post - 16 qualification available in the UK .
It found that the most - prized quality in university students is an ability to think independently , an attribute demanded by every participating university , yet the very quality being squeezed out of the A - level system through pressure of constant change and the need to achieve league table success .
ACS International School 's annual research shows that the new Diplomas receive good support among university admissions officers who feel that the new qualification develops independent thinking and creativity more effectively than traditional A levels ; 45 per cent citing that independent thinking is a core value of the new Diploma , while just 21 per cent say this of A levels .
Overall support for A levels has hardened , however , with the majority of admissions officers , 76 per cent this year compared to 63 per cent last year , saying they do n't want to see A levels phased out at all .
As greater exam choice becomes available for 15 and 16 year - olds in the shape of new Diplomas and AQA Diplomas on offer in some schools and colleges from September , university admissions officers show little confidence in the quality of careers advice available to school pupils at this age , with only a fifth , 20 per cent , rating the advice about all career options , including choosing between work or university , as either good or very good .
Commentators believe this is a key stage at which positive intervention and advice can have a big impact on life choices and access to the best quality higher education .
Just 40 per cent of university admissions officers think advice about choosing the right exam system or subject is good .
Meanwhile more than half of admissions officers , 52 per cent , say that in - school or in - college advice to pupils on completing the UCAS application form is good or very good .
Only a third of admissions officers , 34 per cent , think careers guidance given within schools and colleges about choosing the right university is good ; only 28 per cent think guidance about gap years is good ; and just 20 per cent think the guidance about choosing between work or university is good .
And while a majority , 70 per cent , of admissions officers believe that it does n't make any difference when a student takes a gap year , either before or after university , a minority , 28 per cent , think that better students have taken a gap year before starting at university .
Malcolm Kay , superintendent across the 2,600 pupils at ACS International Schools where the IB programme has been taught for 30 years , says :
" With so many choices available for post 16 educations it is all the more important to seek good advice for pupils at this stage in their lives , where decisions about individual exam courses can have a significant impact on choices later on in life . ”
" There is so much emphasis on measuring our young people by their exam grades that the quality of their education almost seems to get overlooked .
The UK system is one of the most intense at this life stage in the world , and students from some schools and colleges could be forgiven for feeling that they have just emerged from the education equivalent of a sausage factory .
" University admissions officers are saying very clearly that they value independent thinking and self management skills ; with this in mind students should take time to review their options and seek out the best possible advice about their next steps .
Whatever their exam results , student should explore their personal qualities and interests , to identify the best way to develop them in a new environment "
LINQ to Z3 – Theorem Solving on Steroids – Part 1 Sunday , September 27 , 2009 11:55 PM bart
Introduction
It ’s way too long ago I wrote about this side - project of mine , as I got side - tracked by other stuff both inside and outside the realm of LINQ ( more about that some other time around ) .
Last time , I showed how to put “ the query pattern ” to our hand by providing an implementation for the Where operator on top of some Theorem < T > type .
Let ’s recap that to set the scene :
/// < summary > ///
Strongly - typed theorem type for use with LINQ syntax .
/// </summary > /// < typeparam name= " T " >
Enviroment type over which the theorem is defined .
</typeparam > public class Theorem < T > : Theorem {
… /// < summary > ///
Where query operator , used to add constraints to the theorem .
/// </summary > /// < param name= " constraint " >
Theorem constraint expression .
</ param > /// < returns >
Theorem with the new constraint applied .
</ returns > public Theorem < T> Where ( Expression < Func < T , bool >> constraint ) { return new Theorem < T > ( base .
Context , base .
Constraints .
Concat ( new List < LambdaExpression > { constraint } ) ) ; } /// < summary > ///
Solves the theorem .
/// </summary > /// < returns >
Environment type instance with properties set to theorem - satisfying values .
</ returns > public T Solve ( ) { return base .
Solve < T >( ) ; } }
We explained how the non-generic base type keeps track of a set of constraints that have been declared by the user through use of the where query operator , turned into expression trees by the Where signature ’s first parameter .
This allows us to define constraints in a manner that ’s easy on the eye :
using ( var ctx = new Z3Context ( ) ) { ctx .
Log = Console .
Out ; var theo = from t in ctx .
NewTheorem < Symbols < int , int , int , int , int >>( ) where t.X1 - t.X2 >= 1 where t.X1 - t.X2 <= 3 where t.X1 == ( 2 * t.X3 ) + t.X5 where t.X3 == t.X5 where t.X2 == 6 * t.X4 select t ; var result = theo .
Solve ( ) ; Console . WriteLine ( result ) ; }
The Symbols generic type is one way to create a set of symbols used within the declared theorem ’s constraint ( and to print the result if the constraints can be satisfied ) .
From the above you should be able to get an idea about the LambdaExpression instances that are kept in the Theorem < T > ’s base type ’s instance field , as collected through the successive calls to Where .
Remaining question is how to turn the defined theorem into action , something that ’s triggered through the call to Solve .
This mystery is what we ’ll reveal today .
Three steps to solve a theorem
LINQ to Z3 is in fact nothing more but a runtime translator of LINQ expression trees into Z3 calls .
The Solve method lies at the heart of this translation and acts as the entry - point for the user .
It ’s similar to the nature of GetEnumerator in a typical LINQ provider , causing a translation of the query ’s LINQ expression tree into the underlying query language ( e.g. SQL , CAML , etc ) .
Three steps take place to make this work :
First of all , we need to establish an environment with the theorem ’s symbols and inform Z3 about those .
In other words , we map things like X1 to a Z3 counterpart , capturing the name and the type of the symbol ( e.g. “ T1 ” , int ) .
We keep track of the Z3 targets ( in fact those will be IntPtr pointers , see further ) so that subsequent phases of the translation can refer to those when asserting constraints .
Secondly , constraints expressed through LINQ need to be translated into Z3 constraints , based on the established environment above .
We call this phase the assert constraints phase which is implemented as an expression tree visitor pattern .
Here the bulk of the implementation of LINQ to Z3 lives .
Finally , Z3 is queried for a model that satisfied the asserted constraints .
If such a model exists , it ’s still not ready for consumption by the end -user .
To expose the solution in a user - friendly way , the symbols from the environment are mapped onto a .NET object that contains the values satisfying the expressed constraints .
This phase is referred to as the get solution phase .
All of the above translates into the following implementation of Solve , on the Theorem base class :
/// < summary > ///
Solves the theorem using Z3 .
/// </summary > /// < typeparam name= " T " >
Theorem environment type .
</typeparam > /// < returns >
Result of solving the theorem ; default ( T ) if the theorem cannot be satisfied .
</ returns > protected T Solve<T >() { // TODO : some debugging around issues with proper disposal of native resources … // using ( Context context = _context.
CreateContext ( ) ) Context context = _context.CreateContext ( ) ; { var environment = GetEnvironment <T>( context ) ; AssertConstraints < T>( context , environment ) ; Model model = null ; if ( context .
CheckAndGetModel( ref model ) != LBool . True ) return default ( T ) ; return GetSolution < T> ( model , environment ) ; } }
Recall from the previous post that _context is a Z3 Context object that wraps the Z3 Config type .
All we do there is creating a Z3 Context object which is the Z3 primitive to start defining a theorem on .
Let ’s have a brief look at what Z3 ’s Context type provides ( simplified ) :
namespace Microsoft .Z3 { public class Context : IDisposable { public Context ( Config config ) ; public void AssertCnstr ( IntPtr a ) ;
… public LBool Check ( ) ; public LBool CheckAndGetModel( ref Model m ) ;
… public IntPtr MkAdd( IntPtr arg1 , IntPtr arg2 ) ; public IntPtr MkAnd ( IntPtr arg1 , IntPtr arg2 ) ; public IntPtr MkApp ( IntPtr d , IntPtr [ ] args ) ;
…
public IntPtr MkBoolType ( ) ;
…
public IntPtr MkConst ( string s , IntPtr ty ) ;
… public IntPtr MkFuncDecl ( string s , IntPtr [ ] domain , IntPtr range ) ;
… public IntPtr MkGe( IntPtr arg1 , IntPtr arg2 ) ; public IntPtr MkGt( IntPtr arg1 , IntPtr arg2 ) ;
… public IntPtr MkXor ( IntPtr t1 , IntPtr t2 ) ;
… public IntPtr Simplify ( IntPtr a ) ;
… } }
As you can see , the way to communicate with the Z3 library is through IntPtr objects .
Recall the managed Z3 library is a simple wrapper on top of the native library and the “ handle ” mechanism to represent Z3 objects is surfaced through IntPtr objects ( corresponding to pointers ultimately ) .
Various Mk* functions exist to build up expressions that are used to represent constraints .
For example , one could write :
IntPtr cA = ctx.MkConst ( “ a ” , ctx.MkBoolType ( ) ) ;
IntPtr cb = ctx.MkConst ( “ b ” , ctx.MkBoolType ( ) ) ;
IntPtr aAndb = ctx.MkAnd(cA , cB ) ;
ctx.AssertCnstr( aAndb ) ;
This asserts the constraint “ a && b ” ( in C# lingo ) , where a and b are Boolean values , to the Z3 context .
Ultimately we can call CheckAndGetModel to see whether the constraints can be satisfied , and if so a Model is passed back to us :
Model model = null ; if ( context .
CheckAndGetModel( ref model ) != LBool . True )
…
To consume the model , we can use the Model type in various ways :
namespace Microsoft .Z3 { public class Model : IDisposable { public void Display ( TextWriter w ) ; public void Display ( TextWriter w , IntPtr v ) ;
… public IntPtr Eval( IntPtr __p1 ) ;
… public bool GetBoolValueBool ( IntPtr v ) ;
… } }
Either we print the whole model or we evaluate expressions against the Model ( amongst other options ) .
Below is a sample of how a and b can be retrieved .
Notice how cA and cB are used again to query the model :
bool a = model. GetBoolValueBool(model.Eval ( cA ) ) ;
bool b = model.GetBoolValueBool(model.Eval ( cB ) ) ;
All of the above is obviously a code fragment specialized to solve the constraint “ a && b ” , getting the result back as two Booleans .
In LINQ to Z3 we need to generalize the steps above :
We ’ll introduce an environment that maps every symbol from the theorem onto the underlying IntPtr retrieved from calling MkConst .
We ’ll visit the expression trees that declare the constraints , generating Z3 expressions ( e.g. via MkAnd ) and asserting them on the Context .
We ’ll extract the model ’s values for the bindings in the environment to instantiate an object representing the solution ( if any ) .
Let ’s start by looking at the code to establish an environment .
Taking care of the environment
First we need to establish the environment from the T generic parameter type .
E.g. in the aforementioned sample Symbols <…> is our starting point :
from t in ctx .
NewTheorem < Symbols < int , int , int , int , int > >( ) …
But the user could equally well use different means to establish a bag of symbols to write a theorem against , e.g. :
from t in ctx .
NewTheorem ( new { x = default ( bool ) , y = default ( bool ) } ) …
We need to let Z3 know what the types are of the symbols we ’re using here .
Obviously we ’re going to use reflection to extract this information as shown below :
/// < summary > ///
Maps the properties on the theorem environment type to Z3 handles for bound variables .
/// </summary > /// < typeparam name= " T " >
Theorem environment type to create a mapping table for .
</typeparam > /// < param name= " context " > Z3 context .
</ param > /// < returns >
Environment mapping table from .NET properties onto Z3 handles .
</ returns > private static Dictionary < PropertyInfo , IntPtr > GetEnvironment <T>( Context context ) { var environment = new Dictionary < PropertyInfo , IntPtr >( ) ; // //
All public properties are considered part of the theorem 's environment .
//
Notice we can't require custom attribute tagging if we want the user to be able to // use anonymous types as a convenience solution .
// foreach ( var parameter in typeof ( T ) . GetProperties ( BindingFlags .
Public | BindingFlags .
Instance ) ) { // //
Normalize types when facing Z3 .
Theorem variable type mappings allow for strong // typing within the theorem , while underlying variable representations are Z3 - // friendly types . // var parameterType = parameter .
PropertyType ; var parameterTypeMapping = ( TheoremVariableTypeMappingAttribute ) parameterType.GetCustomAttributes ( typeof ( TheoremVariableTypeMappingAttribute ) , false ) .SingleOrDefault ( ) ; if ( parameterTypeMapping != null ) parameter Type = parameterTypeMapping.RegularType ; // //
Map the environment onto Z3 - compatible types . // if ( parameter Type == typeof ( bool ) ) environment .
Add( parameter , context .
MkConst( parameter .
Name , context . MkBoolType ( ) ) ) ; else if ( parameter Type == typeof ( int ) ) environment .
Add( parameter , context .
MkConst( parameter .
Name , context .
MkIntType ( ) ) ) ; else throw new NotSupportedException ( " Unsupported parameter type for " + parameter .
Name + " . " ) ; } return environment ; }
To understand the above , start from the method ’s contract : given a Z3 context , we ’re going to return a dictionary that maps Property Info objects onto IntPtr objects representing the symbols introduced on the Z3 context .
The code is fairly straightforward to understand and only cares about properties ( though one could extend it to allow fields as well ) .
Ignore the TheoremVariableTypeMapping part , which can be dropped from the code for the time being , which will be explained in subsequent posts .
Notice we only support Z3 ’s Bool and Int types .
This was easy , was n’t it ?
Next , the meat of the translator : translating and asserting constraints .
Asserting constraints
Asserting the constraints from the LINQ expression trees onto Z3 constraints is the next , and most complicated , step .
The entry - point to the method responsible for this looks as follows :
/// < summary > ///
Asserts the theorem constraints on the Z3 context .
/// </summary > /// < param name= " context " > Z3 context .
</ param > /// < param name = " environment " >
Environment with bindings of theorem variables to Z3 handles .
</ param > /// < typeparam name= " T " >
Theorem environment type .
</typeparam > private void AssertConstraints <T>( Context context , Dictionary < PropertyInfo , IntPtr > environment ) { var constraints = _constraints ; // //
Global rewwriter registered ? // var rewriterAttr = ( TheoremGlobalRewriterAttribute ) typeof ( T ) .GetCustomAttributes ( typeof ( TheoremGlobalRewriterAttribute ) , false ) . SingleOrDefault ( ) ; if ( rewriter Attr != null ) { // //
Make sure the specified rewriter type implements the ITheoremGlobalRewriter . // var rewriterType = rewriterAttr.RewriterType ; if (! typeof ( ITheoremGlobalRewriter ) . IsAssignableFrom( rewriterType ) ) throw new InvalidOperationException ( " Invalid global rewriter type definition .
Did you implement ITheoremGlobalRewriter ? " ) ; // //
Assume a parameterless public constructor to new up the rewriter . // var rewriter = ( ITheoremGlobalRewriter ) Activator .CreateInstance ( rewriterType ) ; // //
Do the rewrite . // constraints = rewriter . Rewrite ( constraints ) ; } // //
Visit , assert and log . // foreach ( var constraint in constraints ) { IntPtr c = Visit ( context , environment , constraint .
Body , constraint .
Parameters [ 0 ] ) ; context .
AssertCnstr(c ) ; _context.LogWriteLine(context.ToString( c ) ) ; } }
I ’m not holding any information back , so some of the above can be ignored for the time being : mask away all of the code with the word rewriter in it , as it will be explained next time around .
( To satisfy your curiosity , rewriters allow to create domain - specific constraint languages , e.g. to solve a Kakuro puzzle . )
The essence of the code lives in the foreach - loop that translates the lambda expression - based constraints by a call to the Visit method , returning a Z3 expression for the constraint which is subsequently asserted on the Z3 context .
Obviously Visit is where all the magic happens .
To do so , it gets four parameters :
The Z3 context , to call Mk* functions on during the translation .
Our environment , to be able to map occurrences of symbols ( expressed as properties ) onto the introduced Z3 corresponding objects .
Obviously the lambda expression ’s body to translate ( cf. Expression < Func < T , bool >> constraint ) .
) .
And finally , the lambda expression ’s parameter expression object ( so that calls on it can be recognized , e.g. symbols => … symbols . X1 … ) .
On to the visitor now .
Before we do so , let ’s think a bit about the operations we want to support on constraints : arithmetic (+ , - , * , / , % ) , logic ( && , || , ! ) and relational ( < , <= , > , >= , == , != ) .
There ’ll be a few more as we shall see in a minute .
As usual with expression trees , lots of switch - statements will be attending the party :
/// < summary > ///

/// </summary > /// < param name= " context " > Z3 context .

Call : return VisitCall ( context , environment , ( MethodCallExpression ) expression , param ) ; default : throw new NotSupportedException ( " Unsupported expression node type encountered : " + expression .
NodeType ) ; } }
Notice the above is made as declarative as possible : most expression tree node types are mapped on either unary or binary specialized visitor methods , passing in a lambda expression that acts as the “ Z3 constructor ” .
For example , And ( for & in C# ) uses a “ ( ctx , a , b ) => ctx.
MkAnd(a , b ) ” argument .
The VisitBinary method will be responsible to recursively translate the left - hand side and right - hand side of the And operation ( e.g. x & y , where x and y can be arbitrarily complex BLOCKED EXPRESSION , ultimately feeding the resulting Z3 - returned IntPtr objects into the supplied lambda expression .
Next to the VisitBinary and VisitUnary calls , there are specialized calls for the MemberAccess , Constant and Call expression tree nodes .
We ’ll defer the discussion of those for a moment and focus on binary and unary calls first :
/// < summary > ///

Right , param ) ) ; } /// < summary > ///

</ returns > private IntPtr VisitUnary ( Context context , Dictionary < PropertyInfo , IntPtr > environment , UnaryExpression expression , ParameterExpression param , Func < Context , IntPtr , IntPtr > ctor ) { return ctor( context , Visit ( context , environment , expression .
Operand , param ) ) ; }
More documentation than anything else :-) .
Those methods simply visit the expression ’s operands ( e.g. Left , Right for a binary expression , Operand for a unary one ) recursively .
The obtained results , of type IntPtr , are fed into the “ ctor ” delegate parameter to obtain the final result .
Trivial stuff .
Now the more complicated visitor methods for members , constants and method calls .
First , constants :
/// < summary > ///
Visitor method to translate a constant expression .
/// </summary > /// < param name= " context " > Z3 context .
</ param > /// < param name= " constant " >
Constant expression .
</ param > /// < returns > Z3 expression handle .
</ returns > private static IntPtr VisitConstant ( Context context , ConstantExpression constant ) { if ( constant .
Type == typeof ( int ) ) return context .
MkNumeral ( ( int ) constant .
Value , context .
MkIntType ( ) ) ; else if ( constant .
Type == typeof ( bool ) ) return ( bool ) constant .
Value ? context.MkTrue( ) : context .
MkFalse ( ) ; throw new NotSupportedException ( " Unsupported constant type . " ) ; }
This code should be easy enough to understand as well : looking at the type of the constant value , different Z3 calls are made based on the Value property ’s value .
Members get a tiny bit more involved , as that ’s where we need to recognize property accesses for symbols .
In other words , we need to recognize the
/// < summary > ///
Visitor method to translate a member expression .
/// </summary > /// < param name = " environment " >
Environment with bindings of theorem variables to Z3 handles .
</ param > /// < param name = " member " >
Member expression .
</ param > /// < param name = " param " >
Parameter used to express the constraint on .
</ param > /// < returns > Z3 expression handle .
</ returns > private static IntPtr VisitMember ( Dictionary < PropertyInfo , IntPtr > environment , MemberExpression member , ParameterExpression param ) { // // E.g. Symbols l = ... ; // theorem .
Where(s => l.X1 ) // ^^ // if ( member .
Expression != param ) throw new NotSupportedException ( " Encountered member access not targeting the constraint parameter . " ) ; // //
Only members we allow currently are direct accesses to the theorem 's variables // in the environment type .
So we just try to find the mapping from the environment // bindings table .
// Property Info property ; IntPtr value ; if ( ( property = member .
Member as PropertyInfo ) == null || ! environment .
TryGetValue( property , out value ) ) throw new NotSupportedException ( " Unknown parameter encountered : " + member .
Member .
Name + " . " ) ; return value ; }
First we make sure the user did n’t access something outside the realm of the constraint parameter , e.g. :
Symbols < int , int , int , int , int > oops = new Symbols < int , int , int , int , int >( ) ; var theo = from t in ctx .
NewTheorem < Symbols < int , int , int , int , int >>( ) where t.X1 - oops .
X2 >= 1 where t.X1 - t.X2 <= 3 where t.X1 == ( 2 * t.X3 ) + t.X5 where t.X3 == t.X5 where t.X2 == 6 * t.X4 select t;
In essence this is some kind of scope check with regards to the expressed theorem .
Recall the above corresponds to calls to the Where method that look as follows :
ctx.NewTheorem < Symbols<int , int , int , int , int > > ( ) .
Where (t => t.X1 - oops . X2 >= 1 ) …
We ’ve captured the lambda expression parameter “ t ” in the AssertConstraints method and carry it on throughout the visitor so we can check it ’s used as the left - hand side inside constraint expressions .
Note :
This restriction limits expressiveness quite a bit .
For example , capturing an outer variable gives rise to a closure to be created , which is accessed through field accesses ( of type MemberExpression ) .
Such potentially valid uses get rejected by the code above .
To restore such functionality , one can employ partial compilation using LambdaExpression .
Compile , after checking the expression does n’t contain the lambda parameter .
The essence is shown below :
if ( member .
Expression != param )
{
if (! IsLambdaParameterFree(member .
Expression , param ) )
throw new NotSupportedException ( “ Unsupported member expression using constraint parameter . ” ) ;
// Evaluation outside Z3 .
object value = Expression .Lambda( member .Expression ) .Compile ( ) . DynamicInvoke ( ) ;
return VisitConstant ( context , Expression . Constant ( value ) ) ;
}
We leave the implementation of such techniques to the reader , together with the task to hook this logic up in al the appropriate places ( default case of Visit , in VisitCall further on , etc ) .
VisitMember finally consults the environment to map the property access back to the Z3 object generated in the GetEnvironment call .
Finally , we have a VisitCall method as well .
Once more , I ’ve kept some advanced rewriter stuff in here ( to be explained in a subsequent post ) , so ignore that for the time being .
The reason we implement VisitCall is to provide a means to expose advanced Z3 constructs efficiently , e.g. the Distinct operator .
To do so , a Z3 Methods class is provided :
/// < summary > /// Z3 predicate methods .
/// </summary > public static class Z3 Methods { /// < summary > ///
Creates a predicate constraining the given symbols as distinct values .
/// </summary > /// < typeparam name= " T " >
Type of the parameters .
</typeparam > /// < param name = " symbols " >
Symbols that are required to be distinct .
</ param > /// < returns > Predicate return value .
</ returns > /// < remarks >
This method should only be used within LINQ expressions .
< / remarks > public static bool Distinct < T >( params T [ ] symbols /* type ? */ ) { throw new NotSupportedException ( " This method should only be used in query expressions . " ) ; } }
This is very similar to the SqlMethods class of LINQ to SQL , and available for future extensions .
VisitCall has the simple task to recognize calls to Z3 Methods methods , turning them into the corresponding Z3 primitives .
/// < summary > ///
Visitor method to translate a method call expression .
/// </summary > /// < param name= " context " > Z3 context .
</ param > /// < param name = " environment " >
Environment with bindings of theorem variables to Z3 handles .
</ param > /// < param name= " call " >
Method call expression .
</ param > /// < param name = " param " >
Parameter used to express the constraint on .
</ param > /// < returns > Z3 expression handle .
</ returns > private IntPtr VisitCall ( Context context , Dictionary < PropertyInfo , IntPtr > environment , MethodCallExpression call , ParameterExpression param ) { var method = call .
Method ; // //
Does the method have a rewriter attribute applied ? // var rewriterAttr = ( TheoremPredicateRewriterAttribute ) method.GetCustomAttributes ( typeof ( TheoremPredicateRewriterAttribute ) , false ) . SingleOrDefault ( ) ; if ( rewriter Attr != null ) { // //
Make sure the specified rewriter type implements the ITheoremPredicateRewriter . // var rewriterType = rewriterAttr.RewriterType ; if (! typeof ( ITheoremPredicateRewriter ) . IsAssignableFrom( rewriterType ) ) throw new InvalidOperationException ( " Invalid predicate rewriter type definition .
Did you implement ITheoremPredicateRewriter ? " ) ; // //
Assume a parameterless public constructor to new up the rewriter . // var rewriter = ( ITheoremPredicateRewriter ) Activator .CreateInstance ( rewriterType ) ; // //
Make sure we do n't get stuck when the rewriter just returned its input .
Valid // rewriters should satisfy progress guarantees . // var result = rewriter .
Rewrite ( call ) ; if ( result == call ) throw new InvalidOperationException ( " The expression tree rewriter of type " + rewriterType .
Name + " did not perform any rewrite .
Aborting compilation to avoid infinite looping . " ) ; // //
Visit the rewritten expression .
// return Visit ( context , environment , result , param ) ; } // //
Filter for known Z3 operators . // if ( method.IsGenericMethod && method.GetGenericMethodDefinition ( ) == typeof ( Z3 Methods ) . GetMethod( " Distinct " ) ) { // //
We know the signature of the Distinct method call .
Its argument is a params // array , hence we expect a NewArrayExpression . // var arr = ( NewArrayExpression ) call.Arguments [ 0 ] ; var args = from arg in arr .
Expressions select Visit ( context , environment , arg , param ) ; return context .
MkDistinct ( args.ToArray ( ) ) ; } else throw new NotSupportedException ( " Unknown method call : " + method .
ToString ( ) ) ; }
In particular , a call to Distinct is processed by inspecting its argument corresponding to the params - array , recursively translating any of its elements ( e.g. Z3 Methods .
Distinct ( 1 , 2 , s.X1 , s.X2 ) will give rise to two constant expressions and two member accesses , but more complex expressions can occur as the arguments as well … ) .
Ultimately , MkDistinct is called and all is happy .
Now that we ’re done investigating the visitor , we can have a look at the final stage of the LINQ to Z3 - driven theorem solving , the get solution phase .
Getting the solution
To expose the solution to the user , we new up a Plain Old CLR Object ( POCO ) of the theorem ’s generic parameter type T .
All there ’s left to do here is to use some reflection voodoo to instantiate T , populate its properties somehow , and return the object .
Different situations can occur , based on the way the type is defined .
In particular , use of an anonymous type gives some problems as there ’s no formal correlation between the generated constructor and the type ’s properties ( which are get - only , so we ca n’t assign values directly ) .
This is n’t super - exciting stuff , but nonetheless :
/// < summary > ///
Gets the solution object for the solved theorem .
/// </summary > /// < typeparam name= " T " >
Environment type to create an instance of .
</typeparam > /// < param name = " model " > Z3 model to evaluate theorem parameters under .
</ param > /// < param name = " environment " >
Environment with bindings of theorem variables to Z3 handles .
</ param > /// < returns >
Instance of the enviroment type with theorem - satisfying values .
</ returns > private static T GetSolution <T>( Model model , Dictionary < PropertyInfo , IntPtr > environment ) {
Type t = typeof ( T ) ; // //
Determine whether T is a compiler - generated type , indicating an anonymous type .
//
This check might not be reliable enough but works for now . // if ( t.GetCustomAttributes ( typeof ( CompilerGeneratedAttribute ) , false ) .
Any ( ) ) { // //
Anonymous types have a constructor that takes in values for all its properties .
//
However , we do n't know the order and it's hard to correlate back the parameters // to the underlying properties .
So , we want to bypass that constructor altogether // by using the FormatterServices to create an uninitialized ( all - zero ) instance .
// T result = ( T ) FormatterServices .GetUninitializedObject(t ) ; // //
Here we take advantage of undesirable knowledge on how anonymous types are // implemented by the C# compiler .
This is risky but we can live with it for // now in this POC .
Because the properties are get - only , we need to perform // nominal matching with the corresponding backing fields .
// var fields = t. GetFields ( BindingFlags . NonPublic | BindingFlags .
Instance ) ; foreach ( var parameter in environment .
Keys ) { // //
Mapping from property to field .
// var field = fields .
Where (f => f.Name.StartsWith ( " < " + parameter .
Name + " > " ) ) .SingleOrDefault ( ) ; // //

// IntPtr val = model .
Eval( environment [ parameter ] ) ; if ( parameter .

SetValue ( result , model. GetBoolValueBool ( val ) ) ; else if ( parameter .
Property

SetValue ( result , model. GetNumeralValueInt( val ) ) ; else throw new NotSupportedException ( " Unsupported parameter type for " + parameter .
Name + " . " ) ; } return result ; } else { // // Straightforward case of having an " onymous type " at hand .
// T result = Activator . CreateInstance <T >( ) ; foreach ( var parameter in environment .
Keys ) { // //

Theorem variable type mappings allow for strong // typing within the theorem , while underlying variable representations are Z3 - // friendly types . // var parameterType = parameter .
PropertyType ; var parameterTypeMapping = ( TheoremVariableTypeMappingAttribute ) parameterType.GetCustomAttributes ( typeof ( TheoremVariableTypeMappingAttribute ) , false ) .SingleOrDefault ( ) ; if ( parameterTypeMapping != null ) parameter Type = parameterTypeMapping.RegularType ; // //

// IntPtr val = model . Eval( environment [ parameter ] ) ; object value ; if ( parameter Type == typeof ( bool ) ) value = model.

GetNumeralValueInt( val ) ; else throw new NotSupportedException ( " Unsupported parameter type for " + parameter .
Name + " . " ) ; // //
If there was a type mapping , we need to convert back to the original type .
//
In that case we expect a constructor with the mapped type to be available .
// if ( parameterTypeMapping != null ) { var ctor = parameter .

Name + " .
No public constructor with parameter type " + parameterType + " found . " ) ; value = ctor .
Invoke ( new object [ ] { value } ) ; } parameter .
SetValue ( result , value , null ) ; } return result ; } }
Focus on the non-anonymous type case at the bottom , ignoring parts on type mappings ( part of the stuff to be explained another time ) .
The essence is plain simple :
Create an instance of the type .
Go over the environment and :
Extract the value from the Z3 model using the environment ’s stored Z3 object .
Assign it to the property .
Notice get - only properties are not supported , though one could look at LINQ to SQL as a source of inspiration to deal with such cases as well , if desired .
Samples
A few samples of simple theorems using the infrastructure provided above are shown below :
using ( var ctx = new Z3Context ( ) ) { ctx .
Log = Console .
Out ; Print ( from t in ctx .
NewTheorem ( new { x = default ( bool ) } ) where t.x && !t.x select t ) ; Print ( from t in ctx .
NewTheorem ( new { x = default ( bool ) , y = default ( bool ) } ) where t.x ^ t.y select t ) ; Print ( from t in ctx .
NewTheorem ( new { x = default ( int ) , y = default ( int ) } ) where t.x < t.y + 1 where t.x > 2 select t ) ; Print ( from t in ctx.
NewTheorem < Symbols < int , int >>( ) where t.X1 < t.X2 + 1 where t.X1 > 2 where t.X1 != t.X2 select t ) ; Print ( from t in ctx .
NewTheorem < Symbols < int , int , int , int , int >>( ) where t.X1 - t.X2 >= 1 where t.X1 - t.X2 <= 3 where t.X1 == ( 2 * t.X3 ) + t.X5 where t.X3 == t.X5 where t.X2 == 6 * t.X4 select t ) ; Print ( from t in ctx.
NewTheorem < Symbols < int , int >>( ) where Z3 Methods . Distinct ( t.X1 , t.X2 ) select t ) ;
}
The reader should be able to trace through those samples mentally without much trouble .
The Print method is shown below :
private static void Print <T >( Theorem < T> t ) where T : class { Console . WriteLine(t ) ; var res = t. Solve ( ) ; Console .
WriteLine ( res == null ? " none " : res.ToString ( ) ) ; Console . WriteLine ( ) ; }
Given all of this , the output looks as follows :
Sweet !
Notice the use of the Log property on the context object causes the constraints to be emitted to the screen , in LISP - style prefix notation for operators and operands .
Sneak peak
Given the baseline infrastructure we covered in this post , we can start adding layers of abstraction over it to make more advanced theorems easier to express .
An example is a Sudoku puzzle :
var s1 = from t in Sudoku . Create ( ctx ) where t. Cell13 == 2 && t. Cell16 == 1 && t. Cell18 == 6 where t. Cell23 == 7 && t. Cell26 == 4 where t. Cell31 == 5 && t. Cell37 == 9 where t. Cell42 == 1 && t. Cell44 == 3 where t. Cell51 == 8 && t. Cell55 == 5 && t. Cell59 == 4 where t. Cell66 == 6 && t. Cell68 == 2 where t. Cell73 == 6 && t. Cell79 == 7 where t. Cell84 == 8 && t. Cell87 == 3 where t. Cell92 == 4 && t. Cell94 == 9 && t. Cell97 == 2 select t; Console . WriteLine (s1 ) ; Console . WriteLine( s1.Solve ( ) ) ; Console . WriteLine ( ) ;
Or more compactly represented as a string :
var s2 = Sudoku . Parse ( ctx , @ " ..2.. 1.6 . .. 7..4... 5 .....9.. .1.3..... 8...5... 4 ..... 6.2. ..6..... 7 ... 8..3.. .4.9..2.. " ) ; Console . WriteLine ( s2 ) ; Console . WriteLine ( s2.Solve ( ) ) ; Console . WriteLine ( ) ;
Here we ’ve created a domain - specific theorem type , Sudoku , that ’s responsible to provide parts of the constraints .
In fact , a Sudoku has much more constraints than the ones specified by the user : rows , columns and blocks need to contain unique values from 1 - 9 , and every cell has to be within that range .
For the innocent - looking Sudoku above , we get the following set of constraints :
( ( 1 <= p.Cell11 ) && ( p.Cell11 <= 9 ) ) ,
( ( 1 <= p.Cell12 ) && ( p.Cell12 <= 9 ) ) ,
( ( 1 <= p.Cell13 ) && ( p.Cell13 <= 9 ) ) ,

In fact , the reader should be able to create a Sudoku class already based on today ’s literature ( tip : work your way down starting from the signature of Sudoku .
Create you can infer from the sample above ; reuse Theorem < T > of course ) .
More complex puzzles exist though , for example a KenKen puzzle :
Besides constraints on rows and columns and cells , similar to a Sudoku ’s ( with regards to the use of digits 1 through 4 ) , there are more domain - specific constraints : all mathematical operators are commutative .
For example , 1 - in the two - cell region means that Cell12 – Cell22 or Cell22 – Cell12 equals to 1 .
For bigger regions all permutations of cells are considered .
In other words , we need different semantics on operators .
For example :
var k1 = from t in KenKen4By4 . Create ( ctx ) where t. Add ( 4 , t. Cell11 , t. Cell21 ) where t. Sub ( 1 , t. Cell12 , t.Cell22 ) where t. Mul ( 4 , t. Cell13 , t. Cell14 , t.Cell23 ) where t. Mul ( 24 , t. Cell31 , t. Cell32 , t.Cell33 ) where t. Sub ( 3 , t. Cell24 , t.Cell34 ) where t. Div ( 2 , t. Cell41 , t.Cell42 ) where t. Sub ( 1 , t. Cell43 , t.Cell44 ) select t; Console .
WriteLine ( k1.Solve ( ) ) ; Console . WriteLine ( ) ;
results in the following constraints :
( and ( <= 1 Cell11 ) ( <= Cell11 4 ) )
( and ( <= 1 Cell12 ) ( <= Cell12 4 ) )
( and ( <= 1 Cell13 ) ( <= Cell13 4 ) )
( and ( <= 1 Cell14 ) ( <= Cell14 4 ) )
( and ( <= 1 Cell21 ) ( <= Cell21 4 ) )
( and ( <= 1 Cell22 ) ( <= Cell22 4 ) )
( and ( <= 1 Cell23 ) ( <= Cell23 4 ) )
( and ( <= 1 Cell24 ) ( <= Cell24 4 ) )
( and ( <= 1 Cell31 ) ( <= Cell31 4 ) )
( and ( <= 1 Cell32 ) ( <= Cell32 4 ) )
( and ( <= 1 Cell33 ) ( <= Cell33 4 ) )
( and ( <= 1 Cell34 ) ( <= Cell34 4 ) )
( and ( <= 1 Cell41 ) ( <= Cell41 4 ) )
( and ( <= 1 Cell42 ) ( <= Cell42 4 ) )
( and ( <= 1 Cell43 ) ( <= Cell43 4 ) )
( and ( <= 1 Cell44 ) ( <= Cell44 4 ) )
( distinct Cell11 Cell12 Cell13 Cell14 )
( distinct Cell21 Cell22 Cell23 Cell24 )
( distinct Cell31 Cell32 Cell33 Cell34 )
( distinct Cell41 Cell42 Cell43 Cell44 )
( distinct Cell11 Cell21 Cell31 Cell41 )
( distinct Cell12 Cell22 Cell32 Cell42 )
( distinct Cell13 Cell23 Cell33 Cell43 )
( distinct Cell14 Cell24 Cell34 Cell44 )
(= 4 (+ Cell11 Cell21 ) )
( or ( = 1 (- Cell12 Cell22 ) ) ( = 1 (- Cell22 Cell12 ) ) )
(= 4 (* (* Cell13 Cell14 ) Cell23 ) )
(= 24 (* (* Cell31 Cell32 ) Cell33 ) )
( or ( = 3 (- Cell24 Cell34 ) ) ( = 3 (- Cell34 Cell24 ) ) )
( or ( = 2 ( div Cell41 Cell42 ) ) (= 2 ( div Cell42 Cell41 ) ) )
( or ( = 1 (- Cell43 Cell44 ) ) ( = 1 (- Cell44 Cell43 ) ) )
Again the last set of constraints are a result of the LINQ query expression ( as a side - note , different Z3 techniques are available to tackle problems , something outside the scope of this discussion just yet ) .
In order to generate those constraints , the domain - specific Add , Sub , Mul and Div methods need to be translated into Z3 primitives , something that will be done by implementing a rewriter type ( cf. the pieces of code I asked the reader to skim over for the time being ) .
We could go one step further and allow the user to specify the puzzle by means of a visual textual DSL :
var k2 = KenKen4By4 .
Parse ( ctx , @"+#####+#####+#####+#####+ # 4 + # 1- # 4 * # + + + +#####+ # # # # 3 - # +#####+#####+#####+ + # 24 * # # +#####+#####+#####+#####+ # 2 / # 1- # +#####+#####+#####+#####+ " ) ; Console . WriteLine ( k2.Solve ( ) ) ; Console . WriteLine ( ) ;
Or even consume the Word file ( from which the screenshot of the puzzle was taken earlier ) directly :
var k3 = KenKen4By4 .
FromWord(ctx , @ " C:\Users\Bart\Desktop\KenKen.docx " ) ; Console . WriteLine ( k3.Solve ( ) ) ; Console . WriteLine ( ) ;
Finally there are Kakuro puzzles that give rise to yet another desire for better domain - specific theorem expressiveness :
var u1 = from k in ctx.NewTheorem < Kakuro >( ) where k.Cell11.IsBlack where k.Cell14.IsBlack where k.Cell15 .IsBlack where k.Cell24.IsBlack where k.Cell48.IsBlack where k.Cell51.IsBlack where k.Cell61.IsBlack where k.Cell85.IsBlack where k.Cell12.VerticalSum == 23 where k.Cell13.VerticalSum == 30 where k.Cell16.VerticalSum == 27 where k.Cell17.VerticalSum == 12 where k.Cell18.VerticalSum == 16 where k.Cell21.HorizontalSum == 16 where k.Cell25.VerticalSum == 17 where k.Cell25.HorizontalSum == 24 where k.Cell31.HorizontalSum == 17 where k.Cell34.VerticalSum == 15 where k.Cell34.HorizontalSum == 29 where k.Cell41.HorizontalSum == 35 where k.Cell47.VerticalSum == 12 where k.Cell52.HorizontalSum == 7 where k.Cell55.VerticalSum == 7 where k.Cell55.HorizontalSum == 8 where k.Cell58.VerticalSum == 7 where k.Cell62.VerticalSum == 11 where k.Cell63.VerticalSum == 10 where k.Cell63.HorizontalSum == 16 where k.Cell71.HorizontalSum == 21 where k.Cell76.HorizontalSum == 5 where k.Cell81.HorizontalSum
== 6 where k.Cell86.HorizontalSum == 3 select k ;
Here properties are used to indicate constraints as simple as possible , for the following puzzle :
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| ****** | 23 | 30 | ****** | ****** | 27 | 12 | 16 |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| 6 | | | | ****** | 3 | | |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
We do n’t want the user to express things like Cell22 + Cell32 + Cell42 == 23 , but instead want to use all the information captured in the puzzle to allow constraints like Cell12 .
VerticalSum == 23 .
As we ’ll see , this requires other rewriting mechanisms to allow for a good balance of responsibilities between :
The LINQ to Z3 infrastructure .
The Kakuro puzzle library writer .
The end -user .

Oregon and Washington State already allow assisted suicide The Supreme Court in the US state of Montana is due to begin hearing arguments to decide if severely ill people there have the constitutional right to ask their doctor to help them die .
A lower court judgement last December decided that they did , but now the state of Montana is trying to have that ruling overturned .
By and large , the rest of the US does not focus on legal proceedings in the small city of Helena .
It might be a state capital but the " Queen City of the Rockies " has a population of less than 30,000 .
Yet a hearing at Montana 's Supreme Court in Helena may influence how other Americans live and die .
Last December , Montana became the third US state to permit what supporters call " assisted dying " or " death with dignity " .
District Judge Dorothy McCarter had ruled in the case of Robert Baxter , a terminally ill former truck driver who wanted to establish a right in law to ask his doctor to help him die .
Mr Baxter died just hours after Judge McCarter decided the Montana constitution did indeed allow such a right .
But the change has , in effect , been on hold pending this week 's hearing .
The initial ruling was significant because the two states which already permit assisted suicide did so after ballots and prolonged public debate - Oregon in 1998 and then last year Washington .
If what we 're doing is just utilising death to solve the issue of pain then we 're not really dealing with the issue
Moe Wosepka
Montana Catholic Church spokesman Campaigners for assisted dying believe that if the McCarter ruling stands , arguments based on state constitutions could now hold sway elsewhere .
They hope New Hampshire and Massachusetts could be among the next to change their laws .
That both Washington and Montana moved towards assisted suicide at almost the same time was no coincidence .
The organisation Compassion and Choices has been lobbying for years to permit assisted dying state by state .
It believes that momentum is building in its favour .
The group pursues whichever route will work best - legislative change , ballot initiatives or an appeal to a state constitution .
The group identified the Montana constitution , dating from 1972 , as placing a useful emphasis on the privacy of the individual .
Though it might take weeks for a ruling to emerge , those who oppose assisted suicide fear Montana 's historic emphasis on individual responsibility could well see the ruling survive .
' Emotive arguments '
Moe Wosepka speaks for the Catholic Church in Montana .
He acknowledges polls tend to show opinion moving slowly in favour of assisted suicide .
He believes the lobbyists have been skilled in employing emotive arguments .
He says assisted dying may seem merciful but he believes it is just an easy cop -out for society .
" In palliative care , if medications are given to the point where they may hasten death that 's a different issue .
But if what we 're doing is just utilising death to solve the issue of pain then we 're not really dealing with the issue - we 're just getting around it , " he says .
Mr Wosepka points to the active involvement of the Catholic Church in the hospice movement in Montana .
" That 's what all of us need to concentrate on - not on ending patients ' lives prematurely . "
The national chair of Compassion and Choices , Cindi Gibbs , believes the appeal will be rejected .
" Montana has a particularly strong provision for individual dignity and privacy .
It has a strong history of being very supportive of individual choices and rights , " she says .
I do n't want a life that has no quality
Betty Lovelady
Montana resident " So particularly if the Supreme Court in Helena rules it 's a key component of individual privacy , to make this decision with your family and your doctor , then their decision may be more broadly applicable . "
This week 's review is on a point of law : does Montana 's constitution allow assisted suicide ?
It is not up to the seven justices hearing the argument to decide if it should do so .
But Bill , 85 , and Betty Lovelady , 82 , are Helena residents who are sure the answer to that question ought to be yes .
They 've been married for 60 years and when they lived in in Oregon in the 1990s they both voted in favour of assisted dying there .
Since then , Mrs Lovelady has survived breast cancer while her husband has had cancer and heart surgery .
They say they want assisted dying to be available to them in Montana too if their problems recur .
They have discussed the decision with their four children who support them .
" I think it 's cruelty to keep someone alive who 's no longer functioning at all .
What I really dread is being paralysed and not being able to tell the doctor to pull the plug , " says Mr Lovelady .
Inevitable Like her husband , Mrs Lovelady wears a " Comfort One " bracelet to show doctors she does not wish to be resuscitated after any serious medical incident .
And they have arranged a code so that if either is robbed of speech they can indicate to the other if they wish to die .
" It 's human intervention that can keep people alive when they 're in misery , " says Mrs Lovelady .
" I do n't think it 's God 's will that we suffer and suffer .
It 's the doctor 's will or the state 's will .
It 's not my will .
I do n't want a life that has no quality . "
The couple 's concern now is that that death should come with dignity .
Mr Lovelady has no patience with the pretence that death is not an inevitable part of things .
" I 'm going to die .
Betty 's going to die .
Time always wins . "
Until a year ago , only one US state allowed assisted suicide .
Whatever happens in Montana after this week 's hearing it seems likely that number will grow .
With more people living into their 80s and 90s , it is a debate that will not be limited to any one state or to any one nation .

These days , with broadband connections the norm , we do n't need to worry as much about internet speeds or the filesize of our pages .
However , that 's not to say that we still should n't do so .
If you wish to reduce the load times on your server , decrease the number of HTTP requests , and go that extra bit for your visitors , there are a few techniques that you can use .
This tutorial covers a number of PHP tricks , including caching and compression .
1. CSS Amalgamation with PHP
As web developers , we often split up our CSS between several separate files to keep a logical separation and to make modifications easier .
However , this increases the number of requests to the server , resulting in a slower page load .
Using some PHP we can have the best of both worlds ; keeping multiple files on our end , and using one request to retrieve all of them .
Preparation
Before we can optimize CSS files , we will need some CSS to work with !
So let 's make three files and put some CSS in them .
The PHP
We need to get the contents of these files and append them to each other in a specified order .
So our script has to receive the names of the CSS files via URL parameters , open all the files and put them together .
An explanation of the code follows .
Breaking it Down
It looks quite complicated , but stick with me , it 's really pretty simple .
This chunk of code sets the path for the CSS folder and checks that we have been sent some files to work with .
The CSS path needs to have trailing slashes otherwise we will find ourselves with bucket - loads of errors .
If we wanted , we could check automatically for a slash and add it if required .
However , for the sake of simplicity I omitted that behavior .
Next we check each filename and remove any full stops and / or slashes .
This prevents people from navigating the filesystem by passing filenames such as '../../ secret / file '.
Now we have to build our CSS data from the individual files .
To do this , we loop through the files array with foreach , open each file and append the contents onto our data .
The "
" simply adds a new line character to keep things nice and tidy .
The filesize ( ) function is used to find the length of the file so that we can tell fread ( ) how much we want ( the entire file ) .
The last bit of the script is to send the CSS data to the browser .
This means we have to tell PHP that we are sending CSS data , and that it should inform the browser .
We do this with the header function , setting the content type to ' text / css ' .
Then we send the CSS to the client .
We first check if there is any CSS data to send .
If there is n't , then this means that no names of CSS files were sent .
If this is the case we simply reply with a CSS comment saying so .
If , however , we do have some data to send , then we send that and add a message detailing when it was generated .
If you wanted to , for example , add some copyright information to all your CSS in one go , then this would be an ideal place .
Putting it to the Test
Okay , now it 's time to test the script ; we need to first build a directory structure and then place our script and CSS files .
Have a look at the image below and try to replicate that structure .
If you want something different , do n't forget to change the paths to reflect those changes .
Once everything is in the right place , we can test our script .
The directory structure will have to be placed in the ' htdocs ' or ' www ' folder of a webserver with PHP ( pretty much any webserver these days ) .
Navigate to the index . php file .
You should be greeted by a single comment : ' Files not available or no files specified ' .
This means that we have not given any files for it to pull together .
However , the good news is that this is a valid CSS comment and wo n't cause any problems .
Let 's give something a little trickier a go ; type in ' index.php?q [ ] =main ' , you should get the CSS from you main.css file and a notice at the bottom .
If we want to pull multiple files together ( as this was really the entire point of the script ) we can send this request : ' index.php?q [ ] =main&q [ ] =forms ' .
As you can see we can repeat ' q [ ] = ' as many times as we want because it is adding each value to an array .
You could potentially add 50 CSS files together if you wanted using this script .
Concluding
Using this method can be very useful , and can provide benefits such as being able to have a default style sheet for every page and and an extra CSS file for pages with forms .
It 's also easy to implement if you 're already using some sort of CSS processing with PHP .
If you want , you can even rename index. php to index.css as long as you set up .htaccess to treat CSS files as PHP .
You might notice that I 'm treating different orders of CSS files as different .
This is because you may wish to have one stylesheet override another and therefore the order of the files is important .
If this is n't a problem for you , you may wish to perform a sorting function on the files array before processing .
Just a word of caution ; if you place the index .
php file in any folder other than the one that contains the CSS then you have to write your relative background image paths as if index. php was your stylesheet .
This is because that 's what the browser thinks it is .
Alternatively , you could add some code to rewrite these URLs , however , that is beyond the scope of this tutorial .
2. Stripping Whitespace from your HTML and CSS
Many of us use large amounts of whitespace when writing code .
The good news is that whitespace in PHP does n't actually get sent to the browser .
However , it does in HTML .
Browsers tend to only display one space no matter how many tabs you use in your code .
This means that there is some wasted bandwidth .
However , with some simple PHP we can remove this bandwidth leeching whitespace .
Preparation
Once again , we will need some raw data to work with ; so copy the following example HTML and CSS code .
Save the following into a .htm and a .css file in a folder within your server 's webroot directory .
The PHP
One of the advantages of this method is that the same script will work with both HTML and CSS .
Our script has to accept a filename as part of the request .
Once the file has been loaded , it has to strip all whitespace down to just one space character .
This is because we do n't want to remove all the spaces between words !
Once again , ther 's a bunch of PHP here , but I will go through it carefully with you .
Having a Closer Look
This one is n't so tricky , but we will still break it up and make sure we understand what is going on .
We are getting the filename via a parameter passed with the GET request and checking to make sure that it is an allowed filetype .
Then we proceed to fetch the data and process it to remove excess whitespace .
This method is relatively primitive and wo n't remove all unnecessary whitespace , but it will deal with most of it in only a few lines of code !
This snippet just sets some variables .
Once again , we are passing our data through ' q ' as it is nice and short .
This also gives us a place to define our directory for files and extract the file extension .
The explode ( ) function rips the filename up whenever it sees a '.' and puts the bits into an array .
Here we 're checking to make sure that the file is either CSS or HTML .
If it was something else we might find ourselves giving hackers a hole into our site like showing them settings .
php !
So after giving the hackers the flick we can move on to processing our data !
Now for the main attraction ; all we are really doing here is opening the file and reading it - like we did in the first script - and then ripping out as much whitespace as possible .
This is achieved through a relatively simple regular expression that searches through the file for any spaces , tabs or newlines and then replaces them with a single space .
Lastly we send back the data , setting the required headers if we are dealing with CSS .
But Does it Work ?
If you go into your browser and navigate to ' index.php?q=css.css ' we should see one line of CSS across the page .
This shows that everything is fine !
We can also see the same effect on the source code for the html example .
In fact in that small example , we reduced a 314 character CSS file down to 277 characters and a 528 character html file down to 448 characters .
Not bad for 15 lines of code .
Conclusion
So that 's a good example of how we can do quite a lot with very little work .
If you have a look at the source of pages like Google you will find that they have almost no whitespace because , when you receive millions of requests , a few extra kilobytes per request really adds up .
Unfortunately , most of us are n't that lucky !
3. Caching in your PHP Scripts
In this part , I will show you how to ' retrofit ' caching into your scripts using the above script as an example .
The aim is to speed things up by not having to regenerate the data every time someone requests a file .
Generating the content every request is just a waste , especially on static data such as our CSS .
To add caching we need to add three things to our script .
Firstly , we have to collect the data input to the script and generate a filename unique to that set of inputs .
Secondly , we have to look for a cache file and see if it is sufficiently recent .
Lastly , we have to either use the cached copy or generate new content and cache it for next time .
Breaking the Flow
This part of the process really depends on the individual script , however I will show where I am going to break the flow of this script for the caching .
Putting it into Action
We will now actually write the code for caching into this script .
I will first show the script completed and then go through each piece .
The Explanation
This one 's a bit trickier and a little more likely to leave you scratching you head .
But do n't worry , not much has changed and we will go through each section .
An extra feature we have included is the refreshing of the cache every 24 hours .
This is handy so if you change anything , you can either wait 24 hours or simply empty the cache directory .
If you want a different refresh interval just calculate it in seconds .
This bit of code just gets the file 's name and extension , glues them together and adds the cache directory and the appropriate '.tmp ' extension .
Here we 're checking if we have a cache file saved and if the cache file was created within 24 hours .
If both these conditions are met then we open the file and extract its contents to substitute for the scripts output .
We also set $ isCached to true so we can output some messages at the end .
Now we are caching the output of the script for us to use in later requests .
We simply open a file in write mode , dump our data into it and then close it .
Strictly you do n't have to close files in PHP but it 's considered a good practise so I have done it here .
This is another part of the script that was modified a little so that we can offer some feedback through the browser .
If the file was retrieved from the cache we can add a message to the script 's output .
Notice that the message for CSS scripts has '
' at the end .
This is because the characters '//' comment our entire line and '
' pushes everything else onto another line .
If you want to disable the messages all you have to do is comment out the line ' $ isCached = TRUE ; '.
Giving it a Whirl
If we use our script again , we will notice no change until we refresh a second time when we will see a message saying that the file was retrieved from cache .
Sweet success !
This caching setup can also be applied to the first script with little modification , however , that is left as an exercise for the reader .
Concluding
Being able to quickly add simple but effective caching to any script that you are working on is an extremely useful skill .
It just adds that extra bit to the script , reducing the load on your server and speeding up the site for users .
Now that 's win-win !
Summing it Up
In this tutorial I have shown you a few handy but simple ways to speed up your site with a dash of PHP .
I really hope that you find them useful and that you can apply them to a project in the future .

One question that seems to pop up every so often is whether the S&P 500 is overvalued .
To put it simply , it is hyper -valued .
From the 666 low reached in March the index has rallied 57 percent .
Unfortunately much of the rally is based on temporary government stimulus , the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve trashing the dollar , one - time inventory gains , cash for clunkers , $ 8,000 tax credits for home buyers , and artificial stimulus .
These are not the things that makes for sustainable recoveries .
This is like running wind sprints on mile 6 of a marathon .
We have a long way to go to get out of this mess .
On the unemployment front , the rally is being bolstered by “ slower job losses . ”
However , since the rally took off we have lost over 2 million jobs showing up the entire 2001 recession .
In total , we have 26.3 million unemployed and underemployed Americans .
Many of those that are working are seeing wage cuts or stagnant wages .
And on the hiring front , we are at lows that were reached in March :
Source : Gallup
There is little good news here .
Although job cuts might have come down from the 741,000 in January who really expected cuts to stay at that level ?
At that rate , we would have lost nearly 9 million jobs in one year .
That was clearly unsustainable .
But even the current 216,000 job cuts in August put us at a rate of 2.5 million job losses a year .
The market is rallying as if this is good .
It is also ignoring that hiring figure and assuming that somehow jobs will come out of some new field ( or maybe from finance and real estate as bulls would hope ) .
From what industry ?
That is the real question .
The P/E ratio based on operating and reported earnings is all fantasy .
Take a look at this chart :
Source : Chart of the Day
Now this chart is based on the current quarter and most analysts look forward in coming up with an accurate figure .
Bulls on the street are obsessed with operating earnings because this is where you can fudge the data and it is always higher than actual reported earnings .
For example , with the $ 3.5 trillion commercial real estate bust coming many financial institutions currently have these properties on their balance sheets at peak values !
These companies know full well that an avalanche is heading their way but they ’ll milk the accounting as much as possible .
Why else would they be developing clandestine pre-emptive bailout plans if all was well ?
If you look at the past 75 years of data , market peaks were hit at a P/E of roughly 20 times reported earnings and troughs occurred at about 10 .
With the mania we hit a peak of 40 .
The current P/E is off the chart because of the weak quarter .
So think about this for a few minutes .
This is the worst recession since the Great Depression .
You would think that a P/E would reflect this actual fact .
Not the case .
That is why the P/E is blowing right through the chart .
Just run the numbers for Q2 of 2009 .
With 99 percent of S&P 500 companies reporting earnings the earnings per share is $ 13.51 .
That would put the current P/E at $ 77 .
That is insanity .
If we were at even the previous bubble averages of a P/E of 20 , the current S&P should be at 270 .
Now this is merely an observation .
Most market bulls will point to future projected operating earnings which are glossed over with onetime gains and other gimmicks .
If you want to believe in a P/ E of 20 then you need to believe that somehow , we are going to get $ 50 + per share earnings in the next quarter .
And 20 is a historically high P/E ratio .
And these are some of the kinds of earnings folks are projecting even though the consumer ( aka the American worker ) is losing their consumption power .
Keep in mind that many of the short - term operating earnings are going to be based on these onetime injections .
To expect them going forward is to believe in the reemergence of the bubble economy .
Take a look at the contraction in private inventory :
Now obviously a drop like this reflected an end of the world scenario .
So much of the recent jump in activity is now reflecting this more normal pre-bubble world behavior .
Yet the stock market is reflecting valuations from the bubble coming back .
As usual , a bubble will end bad .
And banks have been juiced to the max :
Source : NY Times
The biggest banks have regained $ 700 billion in market cap since the March lows .
How many jobs can you get with $ 700 billion ?
Obviously zero if you ’re the average American given the trend .
Either way , the S&P 500 is massively over value and is predicated on the bubble coming back .
That is not the case .
When reality hits and those onetime fixes run out , the rug will be pulled out again .
The media and pundits are claiming we are now officially out of recession .
If that is the case , you can rest assured this will be a double - dip recession .
That is virtually assured given these absurd valuations and putting all the money back in the casino known as Wall Street .

1 . We 're here at Future Ruby 2009 , in Toronto .
I 'm sitting here with Ilya Grigorik .
Who are you ?
My name is Ilya Grigorik , I 'm with a company called PostRank .
FutureRuby is in Toronto - we 're actually not far from Toronto , but on our way in the fond city of Waterloo , which is known for it 's University of Waterloo .
Lots of great computer science and software engineering crowds there , so we decided to stick around when we started the company there called PostRank .
I'm the founder of the company and right now we 're about 10 people , we 're a Ruby Shop .
2 . What does PostRank do ?
PostRank is an iteration , on an idea that was pioneered by the Google guys , when they invented Page Rank .
When you think about Page Rank , to simplify it , you could think about treating links as votes .
This was a radical idea back in ' 97 when they came up with this idea .
You take text , you take web pages and you look at the links and every link going to another page is an implicit vote .
Then you look at the entire graph and you figure out what are the most popular links , essentially .
I think we can all agree that that worked out to be a pretty good search engine approach .
Of course , they 've iterated in this idea quite a bit and it's much more than that , but one of the things that we 've noticed when we started the company , which was in the early 2007 , was that the web has changed since then .
Links still exist and they continue to multiply at an amazing rate , but all of a sudden , given all the Web 2.0 activity , there are people sharing content on social networks .
So , I find a link and I share it on Facebook , I 'm going to post it on Twitter , I 'm going to have a discussion on Friendfeed , I 'm going to save it to my Del.icio.us Stream and there are a dozen of other ways that people interact with this content .
Each one of those actions is actually an implicit vote , when you think about the quality of that content .
If I can come into InfoQ , read an article and leave a comment that 's a meaningful interaction .
I did n't leave a link , but that says also something about content .
Looking at all this activity , we said " We could actually build a system that aggregates all of these activities from around the Internet and we could build a very interesting ranking engine " , which is exactly what PostRank does .
We have a system , which in real time gathers all the activity going on on most popular social networks , especially in the North America - so Digg , Del.icio.us , Twitter , FriendFeed - we track over a dozen of these networks in real time and we basically see activity streams like " Bob just bookmarked this story " or " John just left a comment on a Dig story that 's pointing to this link " .
We get all that data in real time and then we do analysis on it and say " Here is a story , here is an iPhone story , that is getting a lot of attention from the users " .
Any given day , there are hundreds of stories on iPhone , but there are only a few that are actually getting a lot of this user interaction .
We started this service as a consumer service .
You come to PostRank and you type in any web site or RSS feed , so you type in infoq.com , you get the main feed and then you can actually see beside each story there will be a PostRank score , which is a 1 - 10 , based on how users have interacted with that story , how much interaction there has been with that story .
Then you can actually say " I 'm interested in the best articles .
Are there articles that generate a lot of conversation ? " .
A great use case for this - and this is a personal use case for me - is photography .
It 's a hobby , I like to read about it , I like to know about it , but it 's not something I want to learn about every single day .
It 's something that I do in the weekends kind of thing .
I subscribe to maybe 10 or 20 great blogs on photography , but that 's a lot of content - that 's anywhere from 200 to 400 stories a week and I do n't want to spend my entire week reading that .
What I do is I come to the site and I say " Give me only the articles that generate a lot of engagement from this photography blog . "
For example , if that blog writes about a new camera release from Casio or something like that , it 's probably not going to generate a lot of activity , so it will drop below the filter , but if Casio does a huge recall or there is big kerfuffle about some sort of new camera coming out , I 'm going to get that story .
It essentially acts as an RSS proxy .
You can put in the feed and get another filtered feed and it rinses out all of the articles that had low engagement .
Or , alternatively , you can just use our APIs or you can send us a whole list of stories , like , say you are building your own newsreader , you 've aggregated stories at any given topic , you send them into our API and we give you back all the scores .
We 'll say " Given the 100 articles that you gave us , here is the article with the most engagement .
Maybe that 's the one you should read first . "
Imagine the use case of I 've got 600 stories , I 've got 5 minutes to read , what do I do ?
How do I go through this ?
That 's exactly the problem that we solve .
We provide an API , where you send the stories , we give you back the rank instance , they will hear the stories that people are paying attention to .
3 . It sounds very interesting , very useful in our times to use the resource of all these social sites and the voting of those people that vote on those sites .
How do you make this actually happen ?
What runs on your machines ?
We are a Ruby Shop , we are actually fully virtualized .
We run on Amazon EC2 , we made that decision right from the get go , so we 've been on EC2 since early 2007 .
We were one of the earliest adopters of the platform , definitely not without its trials , especially at the beginning , because it was a very young platform , but it 's proven to be very helpful to us , because we can actually scale out very easily .
We were kind of a prototypical case study for a Cloud Computing launch .
When we launched our website to the public , we had 3 servers and 2 of those were just for kicks kind of thing - if everything explodes , we have some spill over capacity .
A day later , we had 85 servers running on Amazon EC2 - that 's a big number - and to be honest , one of the reasons we had 85 was some of the code was just inefficient , but that 's not the point , we were actually able to scale to meet the demand , because the product that we released really resonated with the users , like you were saying .
It 's the age of information overload and you think that can help you with that , all of a sudden we 've got a lot of articles , so there is a lot of information overload , fighting information overload .
That was just a great use case for us and since then , we 've condensed that number of servers , so right now , we 're probably hovering around 30 or 40 servers on any given day and there are 2 big architectural components to our system .
One is we actually aggregate all of the blog content that users are submitting to us .
Since 2007 we 've been essentially archiving the blogosphere , so that 's a lot of text !
At this point , we have over a terabytes of just raw text for all the stories that have been written since 2007 - that 's one component of our system .
The second component is this real time metrics gathering , also all of that is Ruby and we have essentially a real time stream that we use - RabbitMQ and AMQP protocols to push the data back and forth across the data pipe to provide the filtering capabilities .
4 . You store , basically , the whole output of the blogoshpere , so that 's a lot of text .
Where do you put that ?
We 've iterated a number of solutions .
We started with just MySQL and we pushed that for almost a year at which point it completely broke down and then we started investigating other alternatives and we actually ended up with Lucene , or more specifically , we ended up using Solr .
Lucene is a Java library for indexing text and accessing text performing searches and Solr adds that additional layer or adds an HTTP server , which makes it easy to interact .
So , if you want to store a document in there , you just post to a Solr endpoint and it stores a document .
The same thing for searches - it provides an HTTP interface to do searching .
We 've gone to Solr instead of MySQL and we also sharded our database , so we defined an arbitrary function based on our own internal keys for each feed and we 've split it across many different instances .
We have masters which we use to store content - because it's a lot of content and any given day we see 2 - 3 million new stories a day , so imagine storing 3 million new documents a day , every single day of the year .
This number keeps increasing as we get more and more feeds into our system .
Because that is sharded , we 've been able to add new clusters along the way to help us scale with load .
5 . How do you use MySQL at the moment ?
We migrated away from MySQL for text storage , but we still use it to store all of our metrics .
I mentioned the real time gathering of all the activities , on any given day we see roughly 15 million - 60 million new activities a day .
We want to store each one of those in a database , because all of those are implicit votes .
Again , for the past couple of years , that 's the through - put that we 've been handling .
Every day we archive another 50 million records and this are very lightweight .
You can think of them as there is a URL , there is a key , which may be like somebody just commented on the story , and then we have a counter to say " This story has 15 comments " .
But , as you can imagine , that 's a lot of insert capacity that we need to match that .
We still use MySQL for that and , likewise we had to partition the data quite a bit across many different clusters to allow us to do the insert and the read capacity .
It 's the same problem that we had with Solr and one of the things we found about Solr , MySQL and all the solutions that we looked at is the amount of data that we 're handling kind of pushes the limits on all of the solutions that we 've tried .
MySQL , as we found out , starts to really degrade nonlinearly around 100 GB , if what you 've indexed is 100 GB or a billion records .
We have way more than a billion records for metrics so how do you cope with that ?
Same thing for Solr - for Solr , if you search the mailing list , some of the biggest deployments that we find is 100 million records .
We have , an order of magnitude , more than that .
We ended up finding a lot of really quirky locks and performance bottlenecks that we 've been trying to address internally .
We 've addressed some of them internally , but it 's an ongoing battle .
6 . Where is that battle leading you ?
You gave a talk here about Tokyo Cabinet - something to investigate for you ?
We 've been actively exploring the space in terms of databases .
How can we do this more efficiently ?
It 's one thing to just keep adding hardware , but of course , that increases our cost as well , and we are at start up , so we are sensitive to price or sensitive to all this stuff .
It 's been really interesting for us to see a lot of the databases that have been popping up in the year or so , document oriented storage , all those things .
Specifically , one of the solutions that we looked at was Tokyo Cabinet , which is on one hand a fairly recent project that was started in 2007 by a single developer who 's working for Mixi , which is kind of like a Facebook in Japan .
I 'm not sure how many users they have , but they 're the number one dominant player in Japan , which is a big site .
He started Tokyo Cabinet in 2007 , but up to 2007 he was working on a database project called QDB , which was from 2000 to 2007 and then , in 2007 he said " I learnt a lot by building this thing .
I 'm just going to do this ' rewrite ' thing where I 'm going to take all the mistakes that I made , get rid of them and write Tokyo Cabinet . "
We could actually say that this has been in the works for 9 years or so and it's a very mature project .
One of the things that surprised me when I came across it was I had a couple of people mention to me Tokyo Cabinet and it just flew by and never payed attention , but then , when I started looking at it , I was surprised about how mature the project is .
There is great documentation , the source code is very clean , it 's written in C , great docs and great functionality and it 's really fast .
Just based on that , I started digging more into the author 's blog posts and documentation trying to find if this is something that we could use internally because it relaxes some of the conditions that MySQL has , so there is no concept of - for example - triggers or any of the things that we really do n't use anymore .
I think that 's one of the reasons for the backlash currently in the database community .
There is a lot of the stuff that we do n't use .
We have much more simplified use cases , but it 's a burden on the performance .
We started looking at Tokyo Cabinet for " can we take our databases , the metrics databases for example , and move them to Tokyo Cabinet ?
Is that going to get us an order of magnitude performance increase ? "
We found that , in many cases , that 's true , that 's the case .
Right now , we are still investigating on these applications , we have n't migrated to Tokyo Cabinet , but it 's definitely a very appealing platform for us to think about .
7 . If you look at many of the new databases or the modern databases , like Couch DB or all these things , where does Tokyo Cabinet fit in ?
Is it document oriented ?
Is it key / value ?
Where does it fit in ?
When we talk about Tokyo Cabinet , there is an umbrella - it 's called Tokyo Product .
There are 3 distinct projects , there are all by the same guy and Tokyo Cabinet is just one of them .
Tokyo Cabinet is a library for managing a database , nothing more than that .
Just like Lucene is a Java library for indexing text , Tokyo Cabinet is a C library for key value store , plus a few other engines .
You can build a great embedded database .
There is language bindings for Java , Ruby , Pearl , Lua , virtually any language out there .
If you want to have a really fast embedded database in your application , that 's where Tokyo Cabinet comes in .
Then , there is Tokyo Tyrant , which is a network interface on top of Tokyo Cabinet .
Basically it takes Cabinet and wraps it into an HTTP interface and actually out of the box provides 3 different protocols .
One is the binary protocol - as you would expect - , the second one is HTTP , which actually turns a database into a RESTful land point , so you can just PUT , GET and DELETE and it will do all the things that you would expect and the last one is Memcached .
So you can take your Memcache client in any language , point it at Tokyo Cabinet and it will behave just like a Memcache server .
By default , Tokyo Cabinet defaults to a key / value store model , so it 's a hash table and the project was started as an alternative to Berkley DB , so that 's where its roots are , but it also provides a lot of other engines .
If you think about MySQL , there is MyISAM , there is InnoDB , there is BDB engines .
The same thing in Tokyo Cabinet - there are many different alternatives that you can use for different applications .
There is no right choice , it all depends on the data , the type of data that you are storing .
The hash table is the number one , but there is a table engine which basically allows you to treat Tokyo Cabinet as a document store .
If you are using the Ruby client , you can just pass in a hash full of values and keys in there and it will store that hash , and then you can query it back and get the same hash back and there is no schema .
So , you can just pass in random hashes in there .
The really exciting part about this is it's a schema - less document store , but it allows you to do queries on it as well .
You 've created this document store , now let 's say it was a list of people or attendees for a conference and you have a name and age and sex columns kind of thing , but maybe not everybody provided their age , so that 's a good use case for a schema - less data store .
But now , you can go in and say " Give me all the people that are over the age of 22 " and Tokyo Cabinet will go through the records and find all the right things , not unlike MySQL .
It supports indexes , so you can declare arbitrary indexes on integers , strings - all that kind of stuff .
It 's kind of hard to place it into " Is it just a key value store ? " .
When I think about Tokyo Cabinet , it 's key value store , but more .
It really depends on the use case , because the very simple engine that it has is called " fixed length table " , which best thought of is just a giant array .
You can't even access a data in there through keys like strings .
It 's all done through index offsets .
So , you literally say " 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 " , but you get all the semantics of having a transactional database , so you can do transactions , it 's persistent on disk , you can do replication , all of this things - it really depends .
8 . How do you do queries with Tokyo Cabinet ?
Do you use a language ?
Or how is that working ?
Tokyo
Tyrant is a network interface on top of Tokyo Cabinet and you can either use any of the language bindings that are available .
So if you are a Ruby Shop - like we are - there are at least 3 gems .
One is based on FFI , for example if you are doing JRuby you can actually use the FFI Gem and get access to Tokyo Tyrant , or , if you are looking for raw speed , the C versions , the native extensions are a little bit faster than the FFI ones - you can use those .
Then , from there it really is just like a Ruby hash .
Once you create a database , let 's say an embedded database , via one of the Ruby clients , it walks and talks like a Ruby hash - " Is a key here " or " Let me set a key " .
Then you can do a table .query and you provide the parameters .
It 's a very clean interface for doing this kind of stuff .
9 . If you get the values with the Ruby interface and you have a lot of values , do you have to iterate for all the values or is there a way that Tokyo Cabinet or one of the other tools can run an optimized query ?
Tokyo Cabinet does have concept of iterators , so you can either say " I 'm going to execute this query and give me all the results back " , in which case you may get an array .
Let 's say you were doing a document store , you would get an array of hashes and then it's up to you to do whatever you want with it , or you can actually create an iterator and say " Next , I 'm going to walk this street until I decide to stop . "
Alternatively , one of the things you could do is , let 's say you wanted to run a giant aggregate function across your database .
Recently , the author added the capability to execute MapReduce jobs within the database and this is a great use case for this , where the native bindings actually provide some convenience functions for " Get me all the keys " and you basically write 2 functions .
You say " Here is my mapper , here is a reducer " - in the mapper , the database repeatedly passes you the keys then you do something with them when you say " If this is a string , I 'm going to split it and extract the words .
I 'm going to count a number of the words " .
Then , your reducer - the database is actually responsible for all the intermediate results that pass through your reducer and then you execute that .
If you wanted to do big aggregate functions , that 's probably the best tool .
10 .
You mentioned distribution or you can distribute the database , what tools do you use for that ?
How does that work ?
Have you ever looked at that ?
For distributing data , when we planted the sharded logic at PostRank , it was we did n't use any tools as much as we 've abstracted all that logic behind internal APIs .
We think of everything as a service layer .
From the outside , we have just a big database and , in front of a set of databases we have a Ruby API , so we use EventMachine for all of our APIs .
We have these guys running in front of them , which expose a very simple HTTP protocol .
We send everything in JSON , we get everything back in JSON , but then that API is responsible for handling all the logic of " Where does this key belong ?
Is it Shard 5 or is it Shard 6 ? "
When I query for something , if you give me 3 keys , I 'll figure out that I need to query Shard 2 , 4 and 6 to get that data and return it back to you in a consistent fashion , so you do n't have to think about it .
In our case , it was fairly simple to shard that .
In one case , we have URLs and we want to assign metrics to them , so each URL is mapped to an MD5 string and then we just to a sharding function based on that string .
We 've looked at alternatives ; MySQL has a number of proxy layers that allow you to do transparent sharding .
At the time when we started , none of them were production ready , but I think at this point they are actually getting much more stable .
If you are looking for an alternative , I would encourage you to look at some of the MySQL proxy solutions that allow you to do that , but we just built that internally and we find that they gave us the most flexibility .
11 . You wrote a couple of blog posts about Ruby 's network performance or HTTP performance , what was that about ?
What did you find out ?
At PostRank , as I said , we index and archive the blogosphere and that means we need spiders to actually get all the content and we want that content to be fast , because this is RSS , this is breaking news type of thing .
If you guys write a story , we want to get it out as fast as possible and push it to our readers if it crosses that filtering threshold .
It 's been a challenge for us .
There is a number of open source solutions for writing spiders and it's a non trivial problem .
If you want to just download 100 webpages , it 's not hard ; you use something like Ruby 's Net: : HTTP and you 're done in a couple of minutes .
But , in our case , we have over a million feeds which you want to update every 15 minutes kind of thing and you got to maintain that rate and you want to make sure that you are a good citizen , as well , so you respect the robots file , you are doing all the stuff that a crawler should do .
You look at open source projects like Nutch , which are Java spiders .
We evaluated that but then realized that , in order to embed our build , our custom logic that wanted to index RSS feeds , we would have to do it in Ruby .
Hence , the reason for some of the blog posts about how do we tune the performance of basically doing these network IO in Ruby .
One of the things we found , was we started with Net: : HTTP and that was fine , until we got over 100,000 feeds .
At that point , when we profiled our code , we really saw that was the bottleneck .
It 's blocking IO , we are doing threads , but thread performance in Ruby is also not the greatest , so we started evaluating other solutions and that 's how we got into EventMachine .
EventMachine allows you to do non-blocking IO in Ruby and since then , we 've built all our API servers in EventMachine .
The next step after that was to look at other available libraries for how do we maintain 1,000 parallel connections in one Ruby process .
We ended up using libcurl , which is a very popular library - if you 've ever used the Curl command line client - that 's what you were using .
Libcurl is just the underlying library that powers Curl and we 've contributed quite a bit to the project called Curb and we use that extensively .
It 's Ruby bindings for libcurl and we 've built our spiders using that .
One of the nice things about EC2 is you get a very big data pipe - it 's 250 Mb to each computer .
For our performance , for spidering , that 's exactly what we needed .
The reason we had to go to 80 servers when we launched was we just could n't handle the capacity , we could n't download fast enough , so we had to scale out to that number .
Since then , we 've collapsed everything to 4 servers , which do active crawling and those servers just sustain a rate of anywhere between 10 to 30 MB / second of just downloading content , day in and day out .
We are pushing terabytes of data in and out and we found that libcurl was actually the best solution for us .

Las cosas van de mal en peor en Nuevo León .
Ayer Lunes 31 de agosto , miembros del Ejército Mexicano capturaron en el municipio de Juárez a un sujeto armado y con drogas .
Los medios de comunicación siguieron al convoy militar que llevaba al detenido cuando una patrulla de la policía municipal rebasó a todos y trató de cerrarles el paso a los soldados .
El policía se bajó de la unidad , pero al ver la superioridad numérica de los soldados intentó huir .
Finalmente recibió un balazo en una pierna y fue detenido .
Lo que me hace decir HAZME EL CHINGADO FAVOR es la desvergüenza de estos policías que son los gatos , sirvientes , achichincles y lame botas de los narcos .
¿ Cómo carajos iban a intentar rescatar a un narco detenido enfrentando al Ejército y teniendo a los medios de comunicación como testigos ?
Además de traidores y maricas estos policías son unos imbéciles .

A dormitory burned down and 55 inmates were taken to hospitals after a riot touched off by fighting among Latino and African American prisoners shut down a 1,300 - man unit of the California Institution for Men in Chino on Saturday .
The riot erupted at 8:20 p.m. in the medium - security dormitory - style barracks of the Reception Center West and lasted until about midnight , according to corrections Lt. Mark Hargrove .
Prisoners ripped pieces of metal from lockers , destroyed beds and broke off pipes to use as weapons .
A fire broke out during the chaos , burning down one dormitory .
Most of the unit ’s barracks sustained so much damage as to be uninhabitable .
The disturbance was the prison ’s most violent since a December 2006 uprising in which 200 inmates rioted for 90 minutes .
That racially charged incident was touched off by a fight between a Latino and an African American .

California ’s prisons , which hold 158,000 inmates , are the most crowded in the nation .
Last week , a panel of three federal judges called conditions “ appalling ” and ruled that the state must shrink its prison population by nearly 43,000 inmates over the next two years to meet constitutional standards .
Following a 2005 Supreme Court decision that found automatic segregation to be illegal , Chino and other California prisons are moving away from the historic practice of separating inmates by race .
Inmates may now share cells with prisoners of different races .
The barracks involved in the rioting had been fully integrated .
No guards were reported injured in Saturday ’s riot , prison officials said .

The fighting erupted in one barracks and quickly spread to six others .
“ When you start rioting 200 in a unit , everyone knows it , ” Hargrove said .
At least 80 officers surrounded the barracks and ordered inmates to come out .
Once the riot was quelled , they used pepper spray , batons and foam projectiles to remove inmates who had barricaded themselves inside .
By 7 a.m. Sunday , the barracks were clear .
More than 250 inmates suffered injuries , including small cuts , serious stab wounds and head trauma , Hargrove said .
By Sunday evening , 17 inmates remained hospitalized .
Advertisement
Some inmates were transferred to other units of the complex , which in all houses 5,911 prisoners .
All prisons in Southern California were put on lockdown as a result of the riot .
Visitation was suspended until further notice .
On Sunday , investigators still were determining what caused the melee and what sparked the fire .
They planned to inventory the weapons found at the scene .
The California Institution for Men opened in 1941 and serves as a reception center for parolees returning to custody and for newly committed male felons from several Southern California counties .

The study was done by Strategic Visions on behalf of the Council .
They took ten questions randomly selected from the one hundred used by US Citizenship and Immigration Services to test applicants for citizenship .
To become citizens , applicants have to get six out of ten correct .
Here are the questions and results .
Question Percentage of Correct Answers
What is the supreme law of the land ?
28 What do we call the first ten amendments to the Constitution ?
26 What are the two parts of the US Congress ?
27 How many justices are there on the Supreme Court ?
10 Who wrote the Declaration of Independence ?
14 What ocean is on the east coast of the United States ?
61 What are the two major political parities in the United States ?
43
We elect a US senator for how many years ?
11 Who was the first President of the United States ?
23 Who is in charge of the executive branch ?
29
When this test is given to applicants for citizenship , 92 % score high enough to pass , while only 2.8 % of Oklahoma high school students make the grade .
As pointed out by the Council
Of course , immigrants have had an opportunity to study for the test - a distinct advantage - so we might not necessarily expect a 92 percent passing rate from Oklahoma 's public high - school students .
On the other hand , most high - school students have the advantage of having lived in the United States their entire lives .
Moreover , they have benefited from tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars being spent for their educations .
Many immigrants seeking citizenship , meanwhile , often arrive penniless and must educate themselves on America 's history and government .
After seeing the questions for yourself , you the reader can judge whether a 92 percent passing rate is a reasonable expectation for Oklahoma 's high - school students .
Unfortunately , Oklahoma high - school students scored alarmingly low on the test , passing at a rate of only 2.8 percent .
That is not a misprint .
Look , I can understand that a high school student may not know the exact number of justices on the Supreme Court .
But high school students not knowing who is in charge of the executive branch of government , the Bill of Rights , or the two major political parties , is hard to fathom .
And most disturbing , is the realization that at age eighteen these people are eligible to vote
Are these results unique to Oklahoma ?
Probably not .
Sadly , that result does not come as complete surprise .
When the same survey was done recently in Arizona , only 3.5 percent of Arizona 's high - school students passed the test .
As the nation 's largest newspaper , USA Today , editorialized : " [ T ] he Goldwater Institute , a non-profit research organization in Phoenix , found that just 3.5 percent of surveyed students could answer enough questions correctly to pass the citizenship test .
Just 25 percent , for example , correctly identified Thomas Jefferson as the author of the Declaration of Independence .
I also fear that a great many adults would display the same level of ignorance if this test were administered more broadly .
I 'm reminded of the famous quotation from Daniel patrick Moynahan to the effect that people are entitled to their own opinions but not their own facts .
As these test results indicate , many students , and likely their parents , may have strong opinions that were formed in a fact free zone .

BASHING “ speculators ” is a popular pastime for American politicians trying to explain high and volatile oil prices .
But whether speculation has really been responsible for spiking prices is a controversial issue .
In 2008 the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) issued a report dismissing the role of speculators in last year 's startling run-up in prices .
But banks , hedge funds and others who bet on oil ( without a use for the stuff itself ) still face limits on the positions they can take , if Gary Gensler , the new CFTC head , can show that their influence in markets does harm .
On September 4th the CFTC added more evidence to the debate by releasing what it said were more transparent data on market positions .
Before this month , the CFTC simply classified traders as “ commercial ” or “ non-commercial ” in its weekly report on the overall long and short positions in the market .
Now it has started to disaggregate them further , into producers and buyers , swap dealers and “ managed money ” .
The third category includes hedge funds .
What do the new data show ?
On the New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX ) swap dealers and managed money were both long on oil in the week to September 1st — the former by more than a 2 - to - 1 ratio .
Producers and users , by contrast , are net short on oil by similar margins .
And the swap dealers and managed - money players are bigger in the market , both in terms of the contracts they hold and their own sheer numbers .
But analysts at Barclays Capital note that long swaps accounted for just 6.4 % of total futures and options contracts , not enough to drive prices up on their own .
Physical traders held more of the outstanding long positions ( 10.3 % ) and held even more short positions .
This one set of numbers , in other words , does little to prove that speculators are overriding market fundamentals to drive prices .
New quarterly data also released by the CFTC show that money flows to exchange - traded funds ( ETFs ) in commodities failed to correlate strongly with last year 's price surge .
There are more disclosures to come .
The CFTC says it will soon release the newly disaggregated data going back three years .
If those numbers , like the quarterly ETF data , are equally unconvincing on the role of speculation , the case for limiting positions will be weakened .
And a strong counter - argument remains : that speculators provide crucial liquidity .
Even if they also have some effect on prices , taking them out of the game could well do more harm than good .
It is tempting to look for scapegoats when high prices hurt consumers .
But the real culprits for oil - price volatility may be much more familiar : supply , demand and global instability .

A few months ago , David Tenser from our Support team came to the Metrics team with some ideas for analysis concerning user experience with our support.mozilla.com site ( SUMO ) .
At the time , we did not have the functionality set up to get the data we wanted , but thanks to some hard work from Jeremy Orem and multiple members of our WebDev team , all of this was made possible about three weeks ago !
Now we can see a user ’s search term , which article is clicked on after searching , and whether or not the user thought the article was helpful :
The first bit of data we wanted to extract was our Bounce and Refine Search rates for our top search terms in SUMO .
For this , I defined a bounce as a SUMO visitor searching a particular term and then immediately leaving the site .
Bounces are viewed as failures to give the user results they were looking for .
A refined search is defined as a user that searches one term and without clicking an article link or navigating anywhere else searches for a refined version of the same term .
Again , we look at a refined search as evidence of a user not receiving the appropriate information with their original search .
Here ’s what these numbers look like for our top search keywords :
Highlighted in red are the particularly problematic search terms for SUMO in terms of bounce and refine search rates .
Private browsing is the most alarming — not only is it our third most popular search term , but it also is in the highest bounce rate and refine search rate groups .
From a user standpoint , searching private browsing is most likely an attempt to find out how to turn on private browsing .
We can see this in the data ; the top refined search for this phrase is start private browsing .
Looking at the search results a visitor sees , the only one relevant to private browsing is the top result :
This article does explain how to start private browsing , but the description gives off more of a “ what is private browsing ” vibe .
Either a “ Start Private Browsing ” article should be started or the phrase should be included in this article ’s description .
The bounce rate of home page is a little more perplexing .
It seems the main motivation behind this search is to change the default home page in Firefox .
Fortunately , the top search result is :
So no issues right ?
Looking at the refined searches reveals a surprising anomaly : the top two refined searches are “ set home page ” and “ change home page ” .
I ’m baffled .
Could users just be skipping past this first result without realizing it ?
Not likely , but possible .
We need to explore other reasons for the high bounce rate — maybe users are searching home page for other reasons .
Next up is history .

Astronomers are trying to determine the cause of an expanding spot seen in Venus ' atmosphere .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
The expanding spot discovered on Venus last month may not have garnered as much attention as the meteor impact with Jupiter , but its cause is certainly more puzzling .
While astronomers are pretty sure that the new spot seen in Jupiter 's landscape is caused by impact , there is evidence that this is not true of the spot seen on Venus .
New Scientist reports on why astronomers do n't think the spot of Venus was caused by a meteor :
" The spot is bright at ultraviolet wavelengths , which may argue against a meteoroid impact as a cause .
That 's because rocky bodies , with the exception of objects very rich in water ice , should cause an impact site to darken at ultraviolet wavelengths as it fills with debris that absorbs such light , says Sanjay Limaye of the University of Wisconsin - Madison and a member of the Venus Express team . "
Some of the reasons being advanced for the spot in Venus ' atmosphere include :
* Volcanic eruption .
( This option is considered unlikely , since the thick atmosphere would likely block most volcanic activity from being visible to us . )
* Charged particles from solar interaction with Venus ' atmosphere .
* Atmospheric turbulence concentrating bright material in a confined area .
The other interesting point about the Venus bright spot is that it -- like the Jupiter " scar " -- was first noticed by an amateur astronomer .
The fact that astronomy is so accessible to a wide range of people is interesting in terms of encouraging interest in the sciences .

I t began , as it always did , with a phone call to 911 .
“ Now listen here , ” the caller demanded , his voice frantic .
“ I ’ve got two people here held hostage , all right ?
Now , you know what happens to people that are held hostage ?
It ’s not like on the movies or nothing , you understand that ? ”
“ OK , ” the 911 operator said .
“ One of them here ’s name is Danielle , and her father , ” the caller continued .
“ And the reason why I ’m doing this is because her father raped my sister . ”
The caller , who identified himself as John Defanno , said that he had the 18 - year - old Danielle and her dad tied up in their home in Security , a suburb of Colorado Springs .
He ’d beaten the father with his gun .
“ He ’s bleeding profusely , ” Defanno warned .
“ I am armed , I do have a pistol .
If any cops come in this house with any guns , I will fucking shoot them .
I better get some help here , because I ’m going fucking psycho right now . ”
The 911 operator tried to keep him on the line , but Defanno cut the call short .
“ I ’m not talking anymore , ” he snapped .
“ You have the address .
If I do n’t have help here now , in the next five minutes , I swear to fucking God , I will shoot these people . ”
Then the line went dead .
Officers raced to the house , ready for an armed standoff with a homicidal suspect .
But when they arrived , they found no gunman , no hostages , no blood .
Danielle and her father were safe and sound at home — alone .
They had never heard of John Defanno , for good reason :
He did n’t exist .
“ John Defanno ” was actually a 15 - year - old boy named Matthew Weigman — a fat , lonely blind kid who lived with his mom in a working - class neighborhood of East Boston .
In person , Weigman was a shy and awkward teenager with a shaved head who spent his days holed up in his room , often talking for up to 20 hours a day on free telephone chat lines .
On the phone , he became “ Lil ’ Hacker , ” the most skilled member of a small band of telephone pranksters known as “ phreaks . ”
To punish Danielle , who had pissed him off on a chat line , Weigman had phoned 911 and posed as a psycho , rigging his caller ID to make it look like the emergency call was coming from inside Danielle ’s home .
It ’s a trick known as “ swatting ” — mobilizing SWAT teams to exact revenge on your enemies — and phreakers like Weigman have used it to trigger some 200 false raids in dozens of cities nationwide .
“ When I was a kid , a prank was calling in a pizza to a neighbor ’s house , ” says Kevin Kolbye , an FBI assistant special agent in charge who has investigated the phreaks .
“ Today it ’s this . ”
Like a comic - book villain transformed by a tragic accident , Weigman discovered at an early age that his acute hearing gave him superpowers on the telephone .
He could impersonate any voice , memorize phone numbers by the sound of the buttons and decipher the inner workings of a phone system by the frequencies and clicks on a call , which he refers to as “ songs . ”
The knowledge enabled him to hack into cellphones , order phone lines disconnected and even tap home phones .
“ Man , it felt pretty powerful for a little kid , ” he says .
“ Anyone said something bad about me , and I ’d press a button , and I ’d get them . ”
But in the end , those close to Weigman feared that his gift would prove to be his downfall .
“ Matt never intended on becoming the person he became , ” says Jeff Daniels , a former phreaker who befriended Weigman on a chat line .
“ When you ’re a blind little tubby bald kid in a broke - ass family , and you have that one ability to make yourself feel good , what do you expect to happen ? ”
Matthew Weigman was born blind , but that was hardly the only strike against him .
His family was a mess .
His father , an alcoholic who did drugs , would drag the terrified Matt across the floor by his hair and call him a “ blind bastard . ”
His dad left the family when Weigman was five , leaving Matt and his older brother and sister to scrape by on his disability pension and what their mother earned as a nurse ’s aide .
For Weigman , every day was a struggle .
“ There were times I hated being blind , ” he recalls .
At school , as he caned his way through the halls , other kids teased him about how his eyes rolled out of control .
“ Kids can be cruel , because they do n’t understand what they ’re doing , ” he says .
“ They ca n’t even begin to fathom what they ’re causing , and that stuff eats at your mind . ”
At age four , Matt surprised his mother by making out flashing bulbs on the Christmas tree .
After that , he could perceive faint lights — and he exploited the ability for all it was worth .
He cooked for himself by feeling his way around the kitchen — eggs here , frying pan there , toaster over there — and refused to stop , even after he burned himself .
He shocked his brother by climbing on a bicycle and tearing down the road , using the blurry shadows for guidance .
He taught himself to skateboard , too .
To build his confidence , his mom’s new husband let the eight - year - old Matt drive his car around the empty parking lot at Suffolk Downs , a nearby racetrack .
“ It made me feel a lot better , ” Weigman recalls .
“ I thought , ‘ I ’m doing something that people who see can do . ’ ”
And he could do one thing even better than sighted people : hear .
Weigman became obsessed with voices , music and sounds of all sorts .
He could perfectly mimic characters he heard on the Cartoon Network , and he played his favorite songs on a small keyboard by ear .
He would also dial random numbers on the phone , just to hear who picked up — and what kind of response he could elicit from them .
He fondly recalls the first time he called 911 , at age five , and duped them into sending a cop to his door .
“ You need the police ? ” the officer asked .
“ No , ” Weigman replied .
“ I ’m just curious .
I wanted to see what the operator would do . ”
The cop reprimanded the boy sharply .
“ I would n’t do that no more , ” he said .
But Weigman was hooked .
In real life , he was gaining weight and dodging bullies , struggling to find a place to fit in .
By age 10 , however , he had found the perfect escape : a telephone party line .
The service — a precursor to Internet chat rooms — allows multiple callers to talk with each other over the phone .
Despite the rise of online video streaming , there are still scores of telephone party lines scattered across the country , an odd and forgotten throwback to a pre-digital world .
Compared to texting or video chat , the phone lines have a unique appeal :
They offer callers a cloak of anonymity coupled with the visceral immediacy of live human voices .
Some call to socialize , others for phone sex .
Hoping to give Weigman a social network beyond the confines of his tiny bedroom , a friend had slipped him the number of a free party line known as Studio 55 .
The second Weigman called , a new world opened up to him .
He heard voices .
Some were talking to each other .
Others piped in only occasionally , listening in as they watched TV or played video games .
Weigman found he could decipher each and every ambient sound , no matter how soft or garbled .
Many of the callers were social misfits and outcasts : ex-cons and bawdy chicks and unemployed guys with nothing better to do all day than talk shit to a bunch of complete strangers .
People without a life .
And that ’s when it hit Weigman :
No one here could see each other .
They were all just disembodied voices .
“ We ’re all blind right now , ” he announced to the group .
Weigman was n’t a freak anymore .
But he was about to become a phreak .
Telephone phreaking is n’t new :
The practice , which dates back half a century , was the forerunner of computer hacking .
In 1957 , a blind eight - year - old named Joe Engressia accidentally discovered that he could whistle at the precise frequency — 2,600 hertz — used to control phone networks .
A pioneering phreak named John Draper later realized that the free whistles given out in Cap ’n Crunch cereal boxes also replicated the exact same tone .
Kids with a mischievous streak and too much free time were soon competing to see who could achieve the most elaborate phone hack .
A tech - savvy student named Steve Wozniak , who would soon invent something called Apple with his friend Steve Jobs , once used a series of high - pitched whistles to make a free international call to the Vatican to prank the pope .
As he listened in on the party lines , Weigman began pressing random numbers on his phone , just to see what would happen .
Once he held down the star button and was surprised to hear a computerized voice say , “ Moderator on . ”
He had no idea what it meant .
But when he hit the pound key , the voice suddenly began ticking off the private phone number of every person in the chat room .
Weigman had discovered a secret tool through which a party - line administrator could monitor the system .
Now , whenever someone on the line trash - talked him , he could quietly access their number and harass them by calling them at home .
By 14 , Weigman was conning his way through AT&T and Verizon , tricking them into divulging insider information — like supervisor identification numbers and passwords — that gave him full run of the system .
If he heard a supervisor ’s voice once , he could imitate it with eerie precision when calling one of the man ’s underlings .
If he heard someone dialing a number , he could memorize the digits purely by tone .
A favorite ploy was to get the name of a telephone technician visiting his house , then impersonate the man on the phone to extract codes and other data from unsuspecting co-workers .
Once he called a phone company posing as a girl , saying he needed to verify the identity of a technician who was at “ her ” door .
Convinced , the operator coughed up the technician ’s company ID number , direct phone line and supervisor — key information that Weigman could later put to nefarious use , like cutting off a rival ’s phone line .
There seemed to be no limit to what he could do : shut off your phone service , dig up your unlisted cellphone number , even listen in on your home phone — something only a handful of veteran phreaks can pull off .
Celebrities were a favorite target .
Weigman claims to have hacked and called the cellphones of Lindsay Lohan ( ” She was drunk , and my friend tried to have phone sex with her ” ) and Eminem ( ” He told me to fuck off ” ) .
Last year , during the presidential campaign , Weigman heard a YouTube video of Mitt Romney ’s son Matt dialing his dad .
Weigman listened closely to the touch tones , deciphered the candidate ’s cellphone number — and then made a call of his own .
“ Mitt Romney ! ” he said .
“ What ’s going on , dude ?
Running for president ? ”
Weigman says Romney told him to shove the phone up his ass , and hung up .
In addition to relying on his heightened sense of hearing , Weigman picked up valuable tips on phone hacking from other phreaks on the party lines .
One of the most valuable tricks he learned was “ spoofing ” — using home - brewed or commercial services , such as SpoofCard , to display any number he chose on the caller - ID screen of the person he phoned .
Intended for commercial use — allowing , say , a doctor to mask his home phone number while calling a patient — SpoofCard is perfectly legal and available online for as little as $ 10 .
Some services let callers alter their voices — male to female — as well as their numbers .
Weigman performed his first “ swat ” at age 14 , when he faked an emergency call from a convenience store down the street from his home .
“ Listen , ” he told the 911 operator , “ there ’s a robbery here !
I need you to show up right now ! ”
Then he hung up and called his brother , who was standing watch outside the store .
“ Oh , God , dude ! ” his brother told him .
“ There ’s police everywhere ! ”
“ Really ? ” Weigman replied in awe .
Over the phone , he heard sirens wail in the darkness .
Weigman began spending several hours a day talking shit on assorted party lines .
When someone on the line would challenge him or piss him off , he would respond by faking a 911 call and sending an armed SWAT team to their door .
“ I probably did it 50 or 60 times , ” he says .
He spent most of his time on party lines like Jackie Donut and Boston Loach , which teemed with lowlifes , phreakers and raunchy girls whom Weigman calls “ hacker groupies . ”
Men on the party lines competed to see who could score the most .
“ A lot of guys on there were looking for free phone sex , ” says Angela Roberson , a tongue - pierced blonde from Chicago who got to know Weigman on Boston Loach .
The 34 - year - old Roberson , who stumbled on the line one night when she was bored and drunk , found its rough - and - tumble community oddly appealing .
“ You can sit and talk smack to whoever you want to , ” she says .
“ You get to live in a whole different world . ”
Weigman might be overweight and blind and stuck in his room , but the party line provided him with plenty of opportunities the real world did n’t offer .
When asked how much phone sex he had , he says , “ Oh , Jesus , man — too much . ”
Weigman soon realized that one caller on the party line got his way with the hacker groupies more than anyone else .
Stuart Rosoff , a middle - aged party - liner from Cleveland , had started out as a teenager making obscene phone calls and ended up serving three years in prison .
Overweight and unemployed , with a hairy chest and thick mustache , Rosoff cruised the party lines for girls , introducing himself as Michael Knight , after David Hasselhoff ’s character on Knight Rider .
He was also a member of a gang of phreaks nicknamed the Wrecking Crew .
When Rosoff did n’t get what he wanted on the party line , he turned ugly .
“ Stuart was a malicious phreaker , ” says Jeff Daniels , the former phreak who hung out on the party line .
“ He was limited in knowledge , but good at things he knew how to do . ”
One time , showing off to Weigman , Rosoff singled out a woman who had refused him phone sex and called the police in her hometown , scrambling the caller ID to conceal his identity .
The woman , he told the cops , was abusing her kids — causing the 911 operator to dispatch police officers to her door .
Having proven his power , Rosoff called the woman back and demanded phone sex again .
If she did n’t want to do it , he added generously , he would gladly accept it from her daughter .
“ Stuart was like a mentor to Matt , ” says Roberson .
“ They would joke around and threaten to shut each other ’s phones off just because they were bored . ”
It was n’t long , however , before Weigman surpassed Rosoff as a phreaker .
He began to harass the older man , disconnecting his phone and digging up his personal data to use for leverage and revenge .
Phreakers call this “ the information game , ” and Weigman was the undisputed master .
Rosoff was soon reduced to groveling on the chat lines , begging Weigman to leave him alone .
Roberson felt threatened by Weigman and by Rosoff , who kept pestering her for phone sex .
Once , after a confrontation with Weigman , she picked up her phone only to hear the high - pitched squeal of a fax machine in place of the dial tone .
It had been rigged to last all night .
Despite Weigman ’s denials , Roberson claims he also hacked into her voicemail .
To protect herself from attacks , she became close to another member of Rosoff ’s gang , eventually moving in with him and taking part in one of the Wrecking Crew ’s pranks .
Roberson was surprised when she learned that Weigman was just a teenager .
“ I would have never thought that he was a 16 - year - old , ” Roberson says .
“ He was smart , and he was feared . ”
When Weigman called up a party line , he would brashly announce his presence in the chat room with a little smack talk : “ How you doing , you motherfuckers ? ”
He might be an overweight blind kid , but on the party lines , he could be whoever he wanted .
“ That ’s why he did what he did , ” says Roberson .
“ He was insecure , but he could be powerful here . ”
As Weigman ’s reputation as a phreaker surpassed even Rosoff ’s , his hobby became an obsession .
In a single month , he would place as many as 40,000 calls — ranging from a few seconds in length to several hours .
He dropped out of 10th grade , spending all day on the phone .
His mother was proud that he had found something he was good at and glad he had finally made some friends , if only on the phone .
“ She left it alone because it was my social outlet , ” Weigman says .
Matt was also using his newfound skills to bill purchases to bogus credit cards , snagging everything from free phone service to Dunkin ’ Donuts gift cards .
( ” I love Dunkin ’ Donuts ! ” he says . )
Weigman became a master of what phreakers call “ social engineering ” — learning phone - industry jargon and using it to manipulate telecommunications workers .
One day , Weigman picked up the phone and dialed AT&T .
Two rings , then a voice : “ Thanks for calling , this is Byron .
How can I help you ? ”
“ How you doing , Byron ? ” Weigman asked , adopting the tone of an older man , one at ease with his own authority .
“ Good , ” Byron said .
“ And you ? ”
“ I ’m doing all right .
My name is William Jones .
I ’m calling you with AT&T asset protection .
I ’m actually working on a customer - fraud issue .
We need to write out a D order . ”
In a few short sentences , Weigman had appropriated the name , voice and lingo of a real AT&T agent , ordering a rival ’s phone to be disconnected .
“ What ’s the telephone number ? ” Byron asked .
Weigman rattled off the name and number on his rival ’s account .
Then , to authorize access , he gave Byron the AT&T security - ID code belonging to Jones .
For a moment , the phone filled with the sound of rattling computer keys being struck by expert fingers .
“ Looks like it ’s paid in full , ” Byron said , puzzled .
“ Yeah , ” Weigman said , “ we ’re looking at a fraud account , sir .
We ’re just going to have to take that out of there . ”
As Byron filed a disconnection order , Weigman made idle chitchat in his “ Jones ” persona , speculating on the twisted minds of phone phreaks .
“ Deep down , I know that they know someday they ’re going to get caught up , you know ? ” he told Byron .
“ They just really do n’t think about it .
It ’s crazy . ”
The words applied to Weigman himself .
By now , he had “ stoolies ” on the party lines eager to do his bidding .
As his power on the phones grew , he began to change .
Unable to take the teasing and the pity he got for being blind , he grew sneering and mean , lowering his voice , adopting a manly bluster .
Using the phone to lash out at others , he directed all the rage he felt at the world against his fellow phreaks .
To prove his prowess , he targeted Daniels , a 37 - year - old from Alabama who had been arrested for phone hacking as a teenager .
“ He was calling my landlord and telling him I was a child molester and that I killed people , ” Daniels claims .
Still , there was something sympathetic about the kid .
“ To me , he was still a boy , ” Daniels says .
Having been to jail himself , he did n’t want Weigman to make the same mistakes he had .
So he got Weigman ’s attention the only way he could : by beating him at his own game .
When Weigman refused to stop the phone attacks , Daniels tracked down the teenager ’s detailed personal information , including his Social Security number .
That earned him Weigman ’s respect , and the two became friends .
They would talk for hours on the phone at night , Weigman ’s put - on baritone suddenly replaced by a more childish tone .
“ He was not the big shot he made himself out to be , ” Daniels realized .
Weigman opened up about his miserable and impoverished life , crying as he told Daniels how much he longed to see the world with his own eyes .
His weight fluctuated from boyishly pudgy to extremely obese , and he was spending more and more time locked in his room upstairs , listening to Nirvana and Muddy Waters .
One time , a teacher took his class to a blues club in Boston , and the music seemed to capture what he was feeling : the poverty , the despair , the sense of being trapped .
“ He lived in a jail at home , ” says Daniels .
“ He lived in a box . ”
Daniels urged him to drop the macho bullshit on the party lines and stop drawing attention to himself .
Weigman agreed to keep his mouth shut and even christened his new self - image with a more stoic nickname .
From now , on he would no longer be Lil’ Hacker .
He called himself “ Silence . ”
On a June night in 2006 , James Proulx was watching television at 1 a.m. when a SWAT team suddenly surrounded his home in Alvarado , Texas .
A stocky , gray - haired trucker who had recently undergone open - heart surgery , Proulx went to the door , where he was confronted by two armed policemen — their guns pointed directly at him .
The officers threw Proulx to the ground , snapped handcuffs on him and put him in the back of a squad car .
They had reason to be suspicious .
A call to 911 had come in from Proulx ’s house ; a man identifying himself as Proulx said he was tripping on drugs and holding hostages .
He demanded $ 50,000 so he could flee to Mexico .
He also claimed to have killed his wife .
If any cops got in his way , he warned , he ’d kill them , too .
As the police soon discovered , however , Proulx was just another swatting victim .
It turned out that Proulx ’s 28 - year - old daughter , Stephanie , spent time on Jackie Donut .
When she clashed with Weigman and others , they decided to strike back .
“ If a female would n’t give Matt phone sex , ” she recalls , “ he would call them a fucking bitch and send a SWAT team to their house . ”
Weigman considered Proulx a “ crazy chick who would threaten hackers , ” and he was very direct with her .
“ You ’re annoying , ” he told her .
“ I might come after you . ”
Four months after Stephanie ’s father was swatted , police showed up at her home in Fort Worth , Texas , drawn by a fake call to 911 .
One afternoon , not long after Proulx was swatted , Weigman came home to find his mother talking to what sounded like a middle - aged male .
The man introduced himself as Special Agent Allyn Lynd of the FBI ’s cyber squad in Dallas , which investigates hacking and other computer crimes .
A West Point grad , Lynd had spent 10 years combating phreaks and hackers .
Now , with Proulx ’s cooperation , he was aiming to take down Stuart Rosoff and the Wrecking Crew — and he wanted Weigman ’s help .
Lynd explained that Rosoff , Roberson and other party - liners were being investigated in a swatting conspiracy .
Because Weigman was a minor , however , he would not be charged — as long as he cooperated with the authorities .
Realizing that this was a chance to turn his life around , Weigman confessed his role in the phone assaults .
Weigman ’s auditory skills had always been central to his exploits , the means by which he manipulated the phone system .
Now he gave Lynd a first - hand display of his powers .
At one point during the visit , Lynd ’s cellphone rang .
“ I ca n’t talk to you right now , ” the agent told the caller .
“ I ’m out doing something . ”
When he hung up , Weigman turned to him from across the room .
“ Oh , ” the kid asked , “ is that Billy Smith from Verizon ? ”
Lynd was stunned .
William Smith was a fraud investigator with Verizon who had been working with him on the swatting case .
Weigman not only knew all about the man and his role in the investigation , but he had identified Smith simply by hearing his Southern - accented voice on the cellphone — a sound which would have been inaudible to anyone else in the room .
Weigman then shocked Lynd again , rattling off the names of a host of investigators working for other phone companies .
Matt , it turned out , had spent weeks identifying phone - company employees , gaining their trust and obtaining confidential information about the FBI investigation against him .
Even the phone account in his house , he revealed to Lynd , had been opened under the name of a telephone - company investigator .
Lynd had rarely seen anything like it — even from cyber gangs who tried to hack into systems at the White House and the FBI .
“ Weigman flabbergasted me , ” he later testified .
But Weigman ’s decision to straighten out did n’t last long .
“ Within days of agreeing to cooperate , he was back on the party line , committing his crimes again , ” Lynd said .
Weigman did n’t like being cut off from the only community he had .
“ I was a hardheaded little kid , and I wanted to do what I wanted to do , ” he recalls .
“ I did n’t think this could be serious . ”
He was also obsessed .
“ He ’s not a criminal — he ’s an addict , ” says his friend Daniels .
“ He ’s addicted to Silence , to Lil ’ Hacker , to being the person who is big and bad and bold .
He ’s addicted to being the person who can get every girl to do what he asks over the phone . ”
Daniels , who owns a party line called the Legend System After Dark , tried to channel Weigman ’s energy in a more positive direction by giving him a position as a moderator , making him responsible for managing the phone chats and reining in jerks like Rosoff .
As Weigman ran the calls , he began softening up .
He even had a girlfriend in her 30s , Chastity , whom he had met on a party line .
He seemed calmer since he met her , more the kid he really was .
When they had relationship troubles , he confided in Daniels rather than swatting her .
Before long , though , Weigman returned to his old ways .
Daniels began hearing from party - liners who said they were being harassed by the kid .
“ Knowledge is power , ” Daniels told Weigman , “ but you ’re using it for the wrong reasons .
They ’re going to put you in jail , and you being blind is n’t going to save you . ”
But Weigman would n’t listen .
“ He saw himself as this underage blind kid in a poor family , ” Daniels recalls .
“ So how were they going to put him in prison with big guys who might want to whup his ass ? ”
Unable to reform his friend , Daniels had to let Weigman go .
When the FBI finally busted the Wrecking Crew , Weigman ’s reputation grew .
Recordings and details of his fake 911 calls , including the swatting in Colorado , leaked and spread online .
The attention only made Weigman grow more paranoid and vengeful .
He stepped up his campaign of intimidation , warning his victims that any cooperation with investigators would warrant new attacks .
He told one woman he ’d make her life a “ living hell ” and put her husband out of business .
He threatened a woman in Virginia with a swatting attack — and ended up calling in a bomb threat to a nursing home where her mother worked in retaliation for her talking to the FBI .
He phoned a mother in Florida and said that if she gave his name to investigators , he ’d kill her baby by flushing it down the toilet .
In 2007 , Rosoff and other party - liners pleaded guilty to swatting .
“ I ’m kind of like a nobody in real life , ” he told the judge .
“ I was actually somebody on the phone , somebody important . ”
In a plea agreement that limited his prison sentence to five years , Rosoff ratted out his rival , saying that Weigman had participated in “ targeting , executing and obtaining information to facilitate swatting calls . ”
But Weigman was still a minor , and the FBI did n’t want to go after him .
In a sense , he was being offered a break .
As long as he cleaned up his act , he would n’t be prosecuted .
All he had to do was walk away before April 20th , 2008 — the day he would turn 18 .
After that , any crime he committed would get him tried as an adult .
Late one night that April , the telephone rang at the New Hampshire home of William Smith , the Verizon fraud investigator who was working with the FBI .
When Smith picked up , however , there was no one on the other end of the line .
In the nights that followed , it happened again and again .
At first , Smith did n’t make much of it .
Then one night , his wife looked at the caller ID and noticed something strange :
It was Smith ’s work number , even though he was there at home .
“ Something ’s not right , ” she told him .
Smith changed his home number , but it made no difference .
The phone would ring again at all hours — this time with Smith ’s own cellphone as the point of origin .
Weigman , he soon learned , was using his skills and his network of stoolies to ferret out Smith ’s private phone numbers and harass him .
And he knew Weigman ’s history well enough to know exactly where the calls were leading : a swatting attack .
“ He was fully aware that he might be subject to violence by proxy if Weigman chose to make a false emergency call , ” Lynd testified .
In the midst of the harassment , Smith called a travel agent and booked a flight for his wife to visit their son in Georgia .
Then he called his son to inform him of the travel plans .
Minutes later , the phone rang .
This time , the caller ID showed his son ’s phone .
But when Smith picked up , it was n’t his son after all .
It was Weigman .
Matt was using his phone - company connections to track every call that Smith made and received — and the veteran fraud investigator for Verizon could do nothing to stop him .
Then , one Sunday in May of last year — on a weekend after his wife had flown to Georgia — Smith was working in his yard when a car pulled up .
Out stepped three young men , including one with strange , broken eyes .
“ I ’m Matt , ” the boy told Smith .
Weigman had driven up from Boston with his brother and a fellow party - liner .
Standing in the yard , he could make out Smith ’s dark , shadowy figure against a blotch of white light , and he heard the investigator ’s familiar Southern accent — the one he had so easily identified on agent Lynd ’s cellphone .
Weigman told Smith he was n’t there to threaten or hurt him — he just wanted to persuade him to call off the investigation .
After years of intimidating others , Weigman was now the one who felt intimidated .
He wanted it all to stop .
But Smith was n’t having any of it .
He went inside and called the police , who quickly showed up .
Weigman did n’t run .
He told the cops he had done things that were “ not so nice . ”
When the officers asked what he meant , he said , “ swatting . ”
But after a lifetime of being teased and abused , Weigman was unable to see himself as anything but a victim .
He was just a young blind kid , and here he was getting bullied again .
Smith , he told the officers , had a “ vendetta ” against him .
Less than two weeks after he showed up at Smith ’s house , the police knocked on Weigman ’s door outside Boston and arrested him .
Weigman soon found himself being interrogated by an FBI agent .
He listened in darkness as the agent dialed a number on his phone .
Thirty minutes later , he spouted back the number by heart — and even knew what it was .
“ That ’s the main number of the FBI office here in Boston , ” Weigman told the astonished agent .
But now that Weigman was 18 , his powers could n’t save him anymore .
Last January , he pleaded guilty to two felony counts of conspiracy to commit fraud and intimidate a federal witness .
In June , he was sentenced to 11 years in prison .
These days , sitting in a small holding cell in a Dallas prison , Weigman bears no resemblance to the hulking psycho he portrayed on the party lines .
Dressed in an orange jumpsuit , he ’s slim and soft - spoken , his head shifting as he talks .
“ I ’m not a monster or a terrorist , ” he says .
“ I ’m just a guy who likes computers and telephones .
I used my ability to do certain things in the wrong way .
That ’s it . ”
As Weigman recounts his story , he slips effortlessly into the voices of the people he met along the way .
Every ambient noise — a guard ’s chatter , a bag unzipping , a computer disc whirring — draws a tic of his attention .
“ Let me tell you something , man , ” he says , his voice a bit like that of a young Elvis .
“ If I would have been just a little more mature , if I could just rationalize better , I think I would have been all set .
If , when I was young , I had a full - time male father figure in my life … . ”
He stammers a bit , then recovers .
“ Not having my dad did n’t really bother me , ” he says , “ but inside , it kind of messed me up a bit . ”
Above all , though , Weigman is still a teenager .
While he expresses remorse over his swatting attacks , he takes giddy pleasure in recounting his other exploits — whether punking celebrities or playing the phone companies like an Xbox .
“ The phone system and infrastructure is just weak , ” he says .
“ I had access to the entire AT&T and Verizon networks at times .
I could have shut down an entire area . ”
Then he segues into an earnest pitch for a future job .
“ I ’d love to work for a phone company , just doing what I do legally , ” he says .
“ It ’s not about power .
I know the phone and telecommunication systems and can be a crucial part of any company . ”
In the meantime , he ’s free to brush up on his skills .
Though he ’s restricted from calling party lines , he has phone access in prison .
For a self - described telephone addict , it seems almost cruel , like imprisoning a crackhead with a pipe and a rock .
Could he use the prison phone the same way he used his home phone ?
Could he hack his way , from his prison cell , beyond the guard towers and the razor wire , into the world outside ?
Weigman bobs his head and kneads his hands .
“ I ’m sure I could , ” he says .

Music lovers might see ads for concerts featuring their favourite artists A powerful alliance of privacy and consumer groups have likened behavioural advertising to " being followed by an invisible stalker . "
They now want Congress to curtail the practice of tracking consumers online to tailor ads more effectively .
Yahoo , Microsoft and Google all use targeted online advertisements .
" It 's not just about the right ad at the right time , it 's about creating a profile about you , " said the Centre for Digital Democracy 's Jeffrey Chester .
" These companies want to know about your likes and dislikes , if you are Hispanic , do you vote , are you on a low income or a high income , where do you travel , what do you like to read .
" It 's about a system that not only targets and influences the products you buy but is also a powerful and invisible system of digital persuasion designed to change attitudes and awareness , " Mr Chester told BBC News .
The coalition of ten organisations is expected to call on the government to allow consumers to " opt in " rather than " opt out " of such advertising models .
It will also seek to ensure no data is collected around financial or health matters .
The key , many say , is transparency .
" An individual 's data belongs to them and before these companies track you all over the internet , they need to be transparent about what they are doing and how they intend to use that information , " said John Simpson , consumer advocate with the Consumer Watchdog .
Tracking
The call to put limits on such advertising comes as the House Commerce Committee is drafting legislation to improve consumer privacy online .
Congress held hearings on the issue in June .
Testimony was provided by Facebook , Google and Yahoo .
Campaigners say companies need to be upfront about the data they collect While Yahoo and Microsoft have used behavioural advertising for some time , Google waited until March of this year to employ what is also referred to as " interest - based advertising " .
In general the system uses a cookie - a small piece of text that lives inside a web browser - to track users as they visit different websites .
This information is then used to target online advertising campaigns at consumers because they tend to result in higher online ad return rates .
That means a user who is a keen traveller and visits lots of travel sites would be shown more travel - related ads .
" Golden egg " A coalition of America 's marketing industry trade bodies , representing about 5,000 companies , published a set of seven principles in July to address concerns around the issue .
A broad ' opt in ' would be a sea change and it would be a recipe for disaster
Mike Zaneis ,
Interactive Advertising Bureau
" The vast majority of what happens online is truly anonymous and all marketers and publishers are trying to do is deliver an ad that has some relevancy to the person viewing it at a certain time , " Mike Zaneis , vice president of public policy for the Interactive Advertising Bureau told BBC News .
" The beautiful thing is they do n't have to click on that advert , or pay attention to it or do anything . "
While Mr Zaneis agreed more has to be done to educate consumers about the issue , he also warned that pushing for a blanket " opt in " measure would be disastrous .
" A broad ' opt in ' would be a sea change and it would be a recipe for disaster .
It would kill the goose laying the golden egg .
" The goose is the internet and the golden egg is the free content and services that consumers enjoy and that would be diminished , " said Mr Zaneis .
Other organisations included in this broad alliance include the Consumers Union , Electronic Frontier Foundation , Privacy Lives , Privacy Rights Clearinghouse , U.S. Public Interest Research Group , World Privacy Forum , Privacy Times and the Consumer Federation of America .

After social sharing site FriendFeed slows innovation as its founders ease their way into new jobs at acquirer Facebook , where will its savvy users go ?
Cliqset wants to be the destination .
The Jacksonville , Florida - based startup has turned itself into a site like FriendFeed where users can keep tabs on friend updates from about 70 services including Facebook , Twitter and LinkedIn .
Before , Cliqset was focused on being an identity provider that let users interact with other web services .
( VentureBeat readers can check out the revamped site here with special invite codes . )
The design vaguely resembles Twitter with some additional features like a stream of recently bookmarked sites .
Cliqset also supports updates of a greater variety than just text — users can send photos or bookmarked URLs directly and have their followers comment , like or share them in real - time .
They can also update their statuses on sites like Twitter remotely from Cliqset .
The site is location sensitive so updates can be paired with their coordinates .
Co-founder Darren Bounds says while Cliqset takes some cues from FriendFeed , it has a simpler , more intuitive design .
“ The future of FriendFeed is very ambiguous for a lot of people .
They have a great , passionate user base .
We ’d love to have that passed on to us , ” Bounds said .
“ But they do some things that are atypical for a site that streams activity , which can lend itself to confusion . ”
That said , it might be difficult to gain mindshare when the sharing space has become crowded with startups like ShareGrove , Lissn and Threadsy , not to mention dominant players like Facebook , Twitter and Google .
Cliqset has raised $ 2 million , all from a single investor named Derek Mercer , who founded Vurv Technology , a talent management startup that human resources company Taleo bought in 2008 for about $ 130 million .
Despite the coupons and the special offers , the major supermarket chains are not cheap .
You find a deal now and then , but on the whole they really do n’t give you great value for money .
Farmer ’s markets are good for deals and fresh produce , but they only appear once a week in my area .
But for great produce any day of the week , at silly prices , my local Asian market is unbeatable .
I ’m a huge fan of cuisines from all over the world , and I usually pop into my local Asian market for rice ( 20 lbs for just $ 12.99 ) , Aloe drinks , Kim Chee , dumplings , good soy sauce and some fresh pork buns ; but this time my wife and I did a full shop there .
And wow , what a difference .
Frugal Produce
For a start , the produce was outstanding .
We found over six different types of plums , including Dragon Plums and a delicious mango / nectarine plum combination .
We found so many fruits and vegetables we had never seen before , with wonderful smells and textures .
And then , we saw the prices .
A pound of Dragon Plums was just 79 cents !
Regular black plums were $ 1.29 / pound .
And in Safeway , the same plums were over $ 3 / pound .
Big , big difference .
We also found fresh ripe blueberries for 99 cents / pound , over four times less than in Safeway .
Onions , potatoes , carrots , leeks , melons , broccoli , cabbage , they were all at least a third cheaper than Albertsons or Safeway .
We were shocked .
We filled up the cart .
Cheap Meat Treats
When we went onto the meat section , it was vast .
Asian cooking is the ultimate in frugal food ; no part of the animal is left behind , and as such , the variety on offer was mind - blowing ( vegetarians , you may want to skip this next part ) .
I grew up on liver , steak and kidney pie and black pudding , so I ’m all for different tastes ( I ’m a big fan of Bizarre Foods ) .
A look around the meat and fish section left me wide - eyed .
There were the usual cuts of meat , but there were also things I ’d never seen in a regular grocery store , including duck heads and feet , fish roe , octopus , sea cucumber and so much more it would take a book to jot it all down .
Again , the prices were way less than in our local Safeway and King Soopers , and all of this meat was freshly butchered and packaged in front of us .
Although not quite adventurous enough to cook duck ’s heads , yet , we did appreciate the massive variety .
And the freezer section was just as prolific .
There were so many different types of frozen dumplings and buns that we did n’t know where to start .
And there were a host of Asian ice - creams , alongside the usual Dreyer ’s and Breyers .
More Savings
In the canned food aisles , we explored a host of amazing foods from around the world .
We bagged authentic Ramen noodles and some great sauces and condiments .
And we also grabbed some great drinks , including Mango Ramune .
When it came time to check out , our rickety old cart was straining under the weight .
And the final tally for all of our 12 bags of groceries and fresh produce was just $ 120 .
We will of course be going there again .
On the way out , I said that I was surprised more people do n’t shop at their Asian markets .
Luckily , this blog gives me the chance to get the word out .
So go , check out what ’s on offer at your local asian ( or any ethnic market generally ) and pick up some great food and supplies for much less than you ’d pay at a chain supermarket .

William Safire , a speechwriter for President Richard M. Nixon and a Pulitzer Prize - winning political columnist for The New York Times who also wrote novels , books on politics and a Malaprop ’s treasury of articles on language , died at a hospice in Rockville , Md. , on Sunday .
He was 79 .
The cause was pancreatic cancer , said Martin Tolchin , a friend of the family .
There may be many sides in a genteel debate , but in the Safire world of politics and journalism it was simpler :
There was his own unambiguous wit and wisdom on one hand and , on the other , the blubber of fools he called “ nattering nabobs of negativism ” and “ hopeless , hysterical hypochondriacs of history . ”
He was a college dropout and proud of it , a public relations go - getter who set up the famous Nixon - Khrushchev “ kitchen debate ” in Moscow , and a White House wordsmith in the tumultuous era of war in Vietnam , Nixon ’s visit to China and the gathering storm of the Watergate scandal , which drove the president from office .
Then , from 1973 to 2005 , Mr. Safire wrote his twice - weekly “ Essay ” for the Op - Ed page of The Times , a forceful conservative voice in the liberal chorus .
Unlike most Washington columnists who offer judgments with Olympian detachment , Mr. Safire was a pugnacious contrarian who did much of his own reporting , called people liars in print and laced his opinions with outrageous wordplay .
The perfect way to heal the rift in the Kirk Cameron thread :
Surely the theological contempt we feel for each other is dwarfed by the political contempt we feel for these two imbeciles .
On this foundation does the conservative coalition rest , my friends .
Actually , they ’re probably atheists , are n’t they ?
Heart - ache .
Meetings like this one continue a democratic tradition more than 2500 years old , that of the ancient Greek " Ecclesia . "
The term means " those called out " — called out to discuss and decide civic matters , and to defend their ancient Greek city - states , to defend their democracy .
And you all were called out by notices in the local papers , radio stations , by e-mail and internet , to discuss Health Care Reform and Clean Energy with our Representative tonight .
So know this : efforts to disrupt and thwart public discourse on civic matters are profoundly anti-democratic .
But , that 's an obstacle we face tonight .
It 's public knowledge that groups known as Tea Baggers intend to disrupt and thwart the public discourse on Health Care Reform in meetings like this during this month 's Congressional Recess .
They want Democracy to fail .
So , let 's face this obstacle together .
The Tea Baggers ' instructions are also public knowledge .
If some people stand up , shout out and sit down ; if some try to rattle us and the Congressman ; if some pretend numeric superiority ; if some try to stifle intelligent debate ; then we can compare that behavior to the Tea Baggers ' instructions and draw our own conclusions .
One of the first lessons any teacher learns is that they ’re always biased .
Â
This is actually true .
Â
Teachers are biased , just like anyone else .
Â
However , students take it one step further into assuming the teacher is always biased against them personally .
Â
This is far , far less true .
Â
Still , everyone has had that teacher they assumed personally hated them , so it makes for a good joke .
By the way , that teacher did hate you .
Â
They told me so .
The Dog Ate Global Warming
Interpreting climate data can be hard enough .
What if some key data have been fiddled ?
By Patrick J. Michaels , National Review Online
Imagine if there were no reliable records of global surface temperature .
Raucous policy debates such as cap - and - trade would have no scientific basis , Al Gore would at this point be little more than a historical footnote , and President Obama would not be spending this U.N. session talking up a ( likely unattainable ) international climate deal in Copenhagen in December .
Steel yourself for the new reality , because the data needed to verify the gloom - and - doom warming forecasts have disappeared .
Or so it seems .
Apparently , they were either lost or purged from some discarded computer .
Only a very few people know what really happened , and they are n’t talking much .
And what little they are saying makes no sense .
In the early 1980s , with funding from the U.S. Department of Energy , scientists at the United Kingdom ’s University of East Anglia established the Climate Research Unit ( CRU ) to produce the world ’s first comprehensive history of surface temperature .
It ’s known in the trade as the “ Jones and Wigley ” record for its authors , Phil Jones and Tom Wigley , and it served as the primary reference standard for the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) until 2007 .
It was this record that prompted the IPCC to claim a “ discernible human influence on global climate . ”
Putting together such a record is n’t at all easy .
Weather stations were n’t really designed to monitor global climate .
Long - standing ones were usually established at points of commerce , which tend to grow into cities that induce spurious warming trends in their records .
Trees grow up around thermometers and lower the afternoon temperature .
Further , as documented by the University of Colorado ’s Roger Pielke Sr. , many of the stations themselves are placed in locations , such as in parking lots or near heat vents , where artificially high temperatures are bound to be recorded .
So the weather data that go into the historical climate records that are required to verify models of global warming are n’t the original records at all .
Jones and Wigley , however , were n’t specific about what was done to which station in order to produce their record , which , according to the IPCC , showed a warming of 0.6° +/– 0.2 °C in the 20th century .
Now begins the fun .
Warwick Hughes , an Australian scientist , wondered where that “ +/ – ” came from , so he politely wrote Phil Jones in early 2005 , asking for the original data .
Jones ’s response to a fellow scientist attempting to replicate his work was , “ We have 25 years or so invested in the work .
Why should I make the data available to you , when your aim is to try and find something wrong with it ? ”
Reread that statement , for it is breathtaking in its anti-scientific thrust .
In fact , the entire purpose of replication is to “ try and find something wrong . ”
The ultimate objective of science is to do things so well that , indeed , nothing is wrong .
Then the story changed .
In June 2009 , Georgia Tech ’s Peter Webster told Canadian researcher Stephen McIntyre that he had requested raw data , and Jones freely gave it to him .
So McIntyre promptly filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the same data .
Despite having been invited by the National Academy of Sciences to present his analyses of millennial temperatures , McIntyre was told that he could n’t have the data because he was n’t an “ academic . ”
So his colleague Ross McKitrick , an economist at the University of Guelph , asked for the data .
He was turned down , too .
Faced with a growing number of such requests , Jones refused them all , saying that there were “ confidentiality ” agreements regarding the data between CRU and nations that supplied the data .
McIntyre ’s blog readers then requested those agreements , country by country , but only a handful turned out to exist , mainly from Third World countries and written in very vague language .
It ’s worth noting that McKitrick and I had published papers demonstrating that the quality of land - based records is so poor that the warming trend estimated since 1979 ( the first year for which we could compare those records to independent data from satellites ) may have been overestimated by 50 percent .
Webster , who received the CRU data , published studies linking changes in hurricane patterns to warming ( while others have found otherwise ) .
Enter the dog that ate global warming .
Roger Pielke Jr. , an esteemed professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado , then requested the raw data from Jones .
Jones responded :
Since the 1980s , we have merged the data we have received into existing series or begun new ones , so it is impossible to say if all stations within a particular country or if all of an individual record should be freely available .
Data storage availability in the 1980s meant that we were not able to keep the multiple sources for some sites , only the station series after adjustment for homogeneity issues .
We , therefore , do not hold the original raw data but only the value - added ( i.e. , quality controlled and homogenized ) data .
The statement about “ data storage ” is balderdash .
They got the records from somewhere .
The files went onto a computer .
All of the original data could easily fit on the 9 - inch tape drives common in the mid-1980s .
I had all of the world ’s surface barometric pressure data on one such tape in 1979 .
If we are to believe Jones ’s note to the younger Pielke , CRU adjusted the original data and then lost or destroyed them over twenty years ago .
The letter to Warwick Hughes may have been an outright lie .
After all , Peter Webster received some of the data this year .
So the question remains :
What was destroyed or lost , when was it destroyed or lost , and why ?
All of this is much more than an academic spat .
It now appears likely that the U.S. Senate will drop cap - and - trade climate legislation from its docket this fall — whereupon the Obama Environmental Protection Agency is going to step in and issue regulations on carbon - dioxide emissions .
Unlike a law , which ca n’t be challenged on a scientific basis , a regulation can .
If there are no data , there ’s no science .
U.S. taxpayers deserve to know the answer to the question posed above .

For a supposed terrorist , Ayman Abu Aita is remarkably easy to find .
It takes one phone call to set up a meeting with the man described in the hit movie Brüno as a " terrorist group leader " .
He sits alone at a long , white table in the gardens of the Everest hotel and restaurant in Beit Jala , a mountain village near Bethlehem .
This , he says , is the " secret location " where he met Brüno , played by British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen .
Popular with tourists , the restaurant sits next to an Israeli military compound , not far from the all - seeing watchtowers of the winding separation wall .
" How could he say this about me ? " asks Abu Aita .
" He lied from the beginning and he is still lying now . "
Abu Aita , 44 , from Beit Sahour , near Bethlehem , is described in the film Brüno as a member of al - Aqsa Martyrs Brigade , the armed wing of the Fatah movement .
Now Abu Aita plans to sue for defamation , while Baron Cohen has reportedly received threats from the brigade .
Baron Cohen 's film protagonist Brüno is a gay fashion - obsessed Austrian TV host who , in a short clip featuring Abu Aita , asks to be kidnapped in a bid to get famous .
He thinks that Palestinian terrorists are the " best guys " for the job , because " al - Qaida are so 2001 " .
Promoting the film recently on the David Letterman talkshow in the US , Baron Cohen explained that finding a " terrorist " to interview for the movie took several months and some help from a CIA contact .
He described the secular Martyrs Brigades , most of whom signed an amnesty deal with Israel in 2007 , as " the number one suicide bombers out there " .
Abu Aita said : " My file is clear with the Americans .
I was in the states twice and I travel all the time . "
He is a Christian Fatah representative – of the movement 's political wing , he stresses – for Bethlehem district .
He is also a member of the board of the Holy Land trust , a non-profit organisation that works on Palestinian community - building .
" I am a non-violent activist and I am not ashamed of that , " he says .
The interview with Baron Cohen was set up via Awni Jubran , a journalist for the Palestinian news agency , PNN , who received a call from the film 's producer .
" My friend Awni told me they wanted a Palestinian campaigner to talk about the situation for a documentary , to show young people what life is like in the Palestinian territories , " says Abu Aita .
He met Baron Cohen one week later , accompanied by Jubran and Sami Awad , founder of the Holy Land trust – although Baron Cohen described the two to Letterman as bodyguards for " the terrorist " .
Abu Aita says that Brüno's crew chose the location , which is under total Israeli control – and which appears in the film as Ein el - Hilweh refugee camp , in Lebanon .
" We trust people and we never refuse an opportunity to discuss the Palestinian cause , " he says .
" We went upstairs to one of the hotel rooms and talked about the Palestinian situation for over two hours , " says Abu Aita , adding that Brüno seemed serious – although his knowledge was limited .
At the very end of the discussion , Baron Cohen asked a couple of questions about al - Qaida and Osama bin Laden , which Abu Aita considered oddly out of place and which he asked the translator to repeat .
Then , when Brüno asked to be kidnapped , Abu Aita says that his actual reply was edited out .
" I was angered by the question , " says Abu Aita .
" I said , first of all I 'm not a terrorist .
Second , you are a guest here , so I must take care of you until you leave my country . "
Abu Aita forgot all about the interview until the the film came out and he started to receive countless calls from outraged Palestinians .
" They ask how I could allow myself to be laughed at in this way , how I could agree to it , " he says .
" They are angry that I have embarrassed the Palestinian people , because we are being presented in this false , disgusting way . "
Abu Aita is standing in the Palestinian parliamentary elections slated for January 2010 , and opposition candidates are already using this incident to discredit him .
He says it is also damaging for him to appear in a gay film , which features nudity and graphic sex scenes .
" With our culture and our heritage we refuse such things , " says Abu Aita .
He is well known in the area and several people testify to his good character and good sense of humour .
" Brüno can make jokes about anything he wants , but this is not a joke , " says Abu Aita .
" Calling me a terrorist is not funny – it is lying . "
Discussing his plans to sue , the Fatah official says he did not sign release forms for the footage of him which appeared in the film .
His lawyer , a Palestinian - Israeli from Nazareth , says that such cases can result in million dollar compensation payouts in the US .
A spokesman for Baron Cohen declined to comment .
PARIS , France ( CNN ) -- Leonardo da Vinci 's masterpiece the " Mona Lisa " was attacked with a mug earlier this month , but the world 's most famous painting -- protected by thick glass -- emerged with its enigmatic smile undimmed .
The " Mona Lisa " sits behind bulletproof glass in the Louvre gallery .
French police say a woman " not in her senses " lobbed the mug at the 500 - year - old painting , which hangs in the Louvre gallery in Paris .
The woman , a tourist , was later transferred from police custody to a psychiatric unit , a police spokesman told CNN .
The spokesman declined to be identified , and did not say where the woman was from .
The " Mona Lisa , " considered one of the world 's most valuable paintings , sits behind bulletproof glass in a special wing of the Louvre , attracting visitors in their millions .
The Italian Renaissance masterpiece , which depicts a dark - haired young woman with an aloof facial expression , has been the target of attacks in the past .
In 1956 the artwork was damaged when acid was thrown at it .
A rock was also thrown in a separate incident in the same year .
In 1911 it was stolen from the Louvre but was returned two years later .
CNN 's Flora Genoux in Paris , France , contributed to this report .

The days may be numbered for hybrid car owners who have enjoyed traveling solo in California ’s carpool lanes .
The stickers granting that privilege to 85,000 hybrid owners are set to expire Jan. 1 , 2011 .
There are proposals in Sacramento to extend the deadline , but they would exclude most of the vehicles that originally qualified for the program , such as the Toyota Prius , the Honda Civic hybrid and the original Honda Insight .
“ We ’re bummed , ” said Cathy Margolin , president of the 250 - member Orange County Prius Club .
“ I drive from Newport Beach to Torrance to teach four times a week , and it saves me an hour every day on the 405 . ”
For hybrid owners , losing their stickers would be more than an inconvenience .
The carpool lane exemption added $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 to the value of a used hybrid .
Some used - car dealers say they are already seeing that premium shrink as the deadline gets closer .
Advertisement
“ We ’ve definitely seen those Priuses and Civic hybrids move back toward normal pricing , ” said Carey Caldwell , a local purchasing manager for CarMax , which operates a national chain of used - car dealerships .
The goal of the 2004 law that created the sticker program was to encourage the purchase of advanced - technology vehicles that delivered better fuel economy and produced lower emissions .
Gasoline - electric hybrids with combined city - highway mileage of 45 miles per gallon or better were eligible for a yellow sticker .
The number of yellow stickers was capped at 85,000 , and the last one was given out in February 2007 .
White stickers granting the same carpool - lane exemption were authorized for electric cars and vehicles powered by alternative fuels such as natural gas .
There was no limit placed on these stickers , and so far about 9,500 have been given out .
Advertisement
All the stickers were originally set to expire in 2008 , but the Legislature extended that deadline to 2011 .
Now , lawmakers want to up the ante .
A bill by Assemblyman Ted Lieu ( D - Torrance ) that the Assembly passed this year would extend the carpool lane exemption to 2016 but limit it to drivers of vehicles powered by electricity , natural gas or some other alternative fuel .
A competing Senate bill included hybrids but only those that achieve city - highway fuel economy of 65 mpg or better -- well beyond the official ratings of the current crop of hybrids .
“ What we ’re saying is that the hybrid is n’t good enough anymore , ” said Adam Keigwin , chief of staff for Sen.
Leland Yee ( D - San Francisco ) , sponsor of the Senate bill .

He said the Senate also wants to examine the whole issue of carpool lane exemptions before deciding to grant another reprieve to sticker holders .
Many of the state ’s carpool lanes have become so clogged that California risks losing federal highway funding .
Forcing thousands of driver - only hybrids back into the regular freeway lanes is seen as one way to reduce the congestion .
Even some hybrid owners acknowledge that the original intent of the law has clearly been achieved .
“ I live in Santa Monica and you ca n’t swing a dead cat here without hitting a Prius , so the bill served its purpose , ” said Will Kepper , who has a sticker on his 2001 Prius .

The issue is n’t likely to be settled until the Legislature reconvenes next year .
Makers of alternative - fuel vehicles fret that failing to extend the deadline for the white stickers could remove an important incentive for potential buyers .
Fleet operators are important customers for the natural - gas - powered Honda GX , and the carpool lane stickers are a big part of the appeal , said Todd Mittleman , a spokesman for the Japanese automaker .
“ Our customers are finding them indispensable in Southern California traffic , ” he said .

Sharon Delugach of Los Angeles , a 2003 Prius owner and chief of staff for an L.A. school board member , knows the feeling .
“ I had no idea they were going to expire , ” she said of her stickers .
“ I thought I was set for life . ”

Comic Adaptation
We live in an age obsessed with adaptation .
Why make a new screenplay when you can adapt a book with a built - in fanbase already lining up for tickets ?
Why write a new hit when you can do a punkish cover of a disco classic ?
And why write your own comic when you can take a previously existing story and , hey , presto -- just add art ?
It 's the latter that caused Sarah Boxer 's recent implosion about Ray Bradbury 's Fahrenheit 451 being turned into a graphic novel .
Her hilarious complaint that " �the text is almost always shortened to make way for pictures " suggests that she either does n't understand the difference between an illustrated book and sequential art , or does n't understand the concept of ' redundancy ' .
It pains me to admit that buried under her snitty rant , there 's a sliver of truth .
She quotes Bradbury 's original Fahrenheit 451 about the kind of art that 's apparently awaiting us after our intellectual decline :
" Books cut shorter .
Condensations .
Digests , Tabloids .
� Classics cut � to fill a two - minute book column .
�
Speed up the film , Montag , quick . [ � ]
More cartoons in books .
More pictures .
The mind drinks less and less . "
It 's sad but true .
For decades , comic book adaptations have mostly been terrible , and more or less for Captain Beatty 's reasons given above .
There are exceptions , sure , like David Mazzucchelli's take on Auster 's City Of Glass , or Peter Kuper 's striking version of Kafka 's Metamorphosis .
Many comic book adaptations of classic novels , though , seem less like genuine art and more like a cheap way to lure kids into reading the ' real thing ' -- dumbed - down versions with pretty pictures taking away the sting of any archaic language .
These comics clunk .
They 're curiosities at best , with too much story crammed onto every page and narration plastered all over the art to compensate .
Adaptations of more modern stories are usually worse .
The inevitable comic versions of summer blockbusters tend to be barely successful even as storyboards , existing only to eke extra cash out of the collector 's gotta - catch - them - all mentality .
What makes for a successful comic book adaptation ?
Ask Darwyn Cooke .
His latest graphic novel , Parker : The Hunter , exhibits a firm grasp of the alchemy required to transmute a story from one medium to another .
Cooke might be best known for matching his retro-style to early appearances of DC Comics ' superheroes in the New Frontier miniseries .
( Any superhero story is an adaptation of sorts ; the moment you 're writing Superman , you 're adapting the work of dozens upon dozens of creators who 've gone before you . )
More recently , Cooke took the reigns of rebooting Will Eisner 's The Spirit , managing the tightrope - walk of remaining respectful to Eisner 's work without falling into slavish nostalgia .
While he 's expressed disappointment that he did n't begin his work on The Spirit until after Eisner had passed away , his long - distance collaboration with author Donald Westlake allowed the self - confessed fan to strike up a friendship before Westlake 's death in 2008 .
Speaking at San Diego's Comic - Con this year , Cooke choked up when speaking about his mentor , and quickly changed the subject to a girl he 'd seen outside in an outlandish Pok�mon outfit .
Westlake wrote these novels -- starring the ever - cool criminal Parker -- under the pseudonym ' Richard Stark . '
The surname is deliberate .
It suggests The Hunter 's stripped - back style that refuses almost any insight into the interior life of his protagonist .
According to Cooke , Westlake said that Parker approaches his work " �like a carpenter . "
He does n't like to kill unless he has to , but if he does he wo n't think twice .
He 's a man of action , not reflection -- and that 's what makes his story an ideal fit for sequential art .
Cooke catalogues these deeds with only minimal narration .
( Yes , this means you have to pay close attention . )
We 're offered few glimpses into what drives Parker ; barrelling towards the book 's conclusion , he himself wonders , and guesses it might just be blind momentum .
Cooke allows himself a creative flourish to pry open the novel 's lone emotional fissure .
When the narrator admits ( even if Parker himself wo n't ) that he 's afraid of the feelings he still has for his ex-wife , Cooke adds a quick dream sequence to drive the moment home .
Cooke mostly plays his version as close to the original as he can .
It begins with Parker stalking the streets , snapping at strangers , out of jail and ready for revenge .
He 's been double - crossed during an out - of - town heist , and he wants both blood and the money he 's owed .
He 'll use and abuse anyone in his way to get what he 's owed , beginning with his ex-wife and ending with a country - wide collection of criminals Parker calls the Syndicate -- even though he 's told that word became " square " while he was out of commission .
Raymond Chandler 's definition of a hero in The Simple Art of Murder was someone who walks the mean streets but who " �is not himself mean . "
Parker is mean .
He 's cities away from your usual antihero - with - heart - of - gold .
The fact that he was already planning on double - crossing the man who double - crossed him ?
It does n't seem to affect his bloody moral imperative .
It 's impossible to compare two versions of the same story without performing the mathematical equation of what 's been gained versus what 's been lost .
Cooke 's obviously thought long and hard about every technique in every panel , eschewing tricks and gimmicks .
" Just a straight line through it , " Cooke explained .
" Bang bang bang . "
But there are some things that sequential art can't capture .
Read the following description from the original novel :
" The office women looked at him and shivered .
They knew he was a bastard , they knew his big hands were born to slap with , they knew his face would never break into a smile when he looked at a woman .
They knew what he was , they thanked God for their husbands , and still they shivered .
Because they knew how he would fall on a woman in the night .
Like a tree . "
In Cooke 's nearly wordless first dozen pages , he draws a woman seeing Parker and turning away , frightened .
He draws it well , too -- but how can it possibly add up to that paragraph ?
Similarly , Parker 's face seems too smooth , too generic , for the character , no matter how much shadow sits around his eyes .
His body can be more effective than in prose , however .
When we see Parker , lost in memory and small in the frame while riding the subway , we feel his exhaustion .
Cooke also runs with the book 's obsession with describing Parker 's hands .
( When a mook he 's threatening says " I do n't see no weapon ! "
Parker replies , " You see two of them .
They 're all I need . " )
Cooke sometimes places us behind Parker 's eyes , or close enough to it , watching his hands stretch out before us -- echoing 1947 's first - person noir Lady In The Lake .
The presentation here is immaculate .
The book is designed to look like it could have been plucked off a shelf back in 1963 , with paper so thick my fingertips kept telling me I 'd turned two pages at once , and art washed with dark blue tones so you feel like you 're reading through heavy - lidded eyes .
The flashbacks come with big , soft dots and text down the side .
And not to get all Scott McCloud semiotic on you , but what an adaptation can provide is more than just pictures .
It also offers a new sense of space and time .
There 's a double - page spread , about half way through The Hunter , illustrating just two sentences .
We see Parker 's shadow , climbing in through the window .
His target , here captured mid-leap for his gun , has " �got himself the best hotel suite and the best professional lay .
And he got them just in time . "
It 's more than just a dramatic splash .
It 's a perfect short story , embedded in the middle of the book .
This is the true testament to Cooke 's skill : the story in his version of The Hunter does n't feel folded , crunched , or flattened to fit its new medium .
Sure , the story runs out of narrative tension about two - thirds through , but that 's true of the novel , too .
Parker 's particular skills as a ' carpenter ' means the ending is never in doubt .
Who'd be mean enough to kill him ?
Adapting a cult novel is one thing , but you 'd think doing the same to the Bible would give people pause .
The first comic book I hazily remember owning was a series of stories from the Old Testament .
They featured the adventures of smiling , pastel - robed , inevitably Caucasian - looking prophets .
There 's nothing new about these books .
They 're meant to be a first - hit 's - for - free introduction that will drive young readers straight to Sunday School .
They sidestep the bloodier , stranger parts of the Bible : the demons and massacres , the murdered babies and fevered dreams .
I always think of Laurie Anderson 's piece ' The Salesman , ' and her baffled wonderment that her everyday neighbours accept the most bizarre Bible stories without batting an eyelid .
" So in a way , " she says , " I was introduced to a special local form of surrealism at an early age ... "
Enter Basil Wolverton .
Recently described as the " Michelangelo of Mad magazine " by the New York Times , Wolverton 's bizarre and grotesque artwork won him legions of adolescent fans from the 1940s onwards .
( And prizes , too : the fact that his drawing of ' Lena the Hyena ' won a Li'l Abner competition in 1946 is always worth repeating when you hear that the three judges were the pop-culture Holy Trinity of Frank Sinatra , Boris Karloff and Salvador Dal� . )
You can still see his influence in many of today 's alt - indie cartoonists .
Wolverton 's hyper - dense images can give you the same uneasy feeling you get when wading through Charles Burns ' Black Hole : the sense that you 're staring directly into someone else 's subconscious .
Wolverton , however , did n't want to be remembered for his work for Mad , or Plop ! , or Life , or his creations for Topps ' " ugly stickers .
"
He said he'd prefer to be remembered for his Bible illustrations .
These newly - collected stories are n't the least bit ironic ; they 're genuine works of faith created for the Worldwide Church of God and Ambassador College corporations from 1953 to 1974 .
They cover the Old Testament 's greatest hits and then skip forward to the Book of Revelation .
( Wolverton 's partner in these books , the millennial preacher Herbert W. Armstrong , believed that picturing Jesus in any form was a violation of the Second Commandment . )
Beginning with Genesis -- where else ? --
Wolverton provides all the cosmic grandeur you 'd expect .
It 's when Adam and Eve are evicted from paradise that things become disquieting .
He draws them running for their lives from an Angel 's sword hanging ominously in the foreground .
They 're terrified .
A quick flick through the book shows that the cast of Wolverton 's Bible stories are all terrified .
With good reason , too .
When Noah 's flood arrives , the artist is less interested in the animals queuing politely to enter the ark ; he spends page after page on those that are left behind , scrabbling desperately against the sides of the boat , begging for mercy from their watery deaths .
( In fact , some of these images were originally deemed too disturbing for publication . )
Wolverton takes his time with these early Old Testament stories , and provides enough pictures that anyone with the leftovers of a religious childhood can follow along without the captions .
Soon after , the time consumed by the insane detail of his artwork forced him to encapsulate more narrative with fewer images .
The illustrations immediately become less concrete , more expressionistic .
Faces float on white backgrounds .
Cities rise and fall with barely a page - turn .
Suddenly , this new economy provides easy insight into the aspects of bible stories that most capture Wolverton 's heart .
For example , he chooses only three panels to illustrate the story of poor old Job : a lightning strike destroying his livestock ; his house -- family still inside -- whisked away in a whirlwind ; and Job , sitting alone , hopeless and diseased .
There 's no hint of the pact between God and the Devil that caused all this , or the ( sort of ) happy ending where his prosperity is restored .
Just three panels of misery .
Despite these decisions , I could n't describe the reading experience of The Wolverton Bible as a bleak one .
Underneath the screaming and plagues , the giddy joy that he seems to take in his art radiates off the page , just like it does in his secular work .
Who else would draw a sharp - toothed sea-monster in the Red Sea , crashing down after Moses parts the water ?
( LOOK OUT , EGYPTIAN SLAVE - LORDS ! )
Wolverton saw no conflict between his Christian ministry and his freelance work beloved by teenage boys and underground artists .
He and Armstrong set out to provide something more accurate than those pastel bible books I mentioned above , and -- according to his son's introduction -- Wolverton " ... saw that the biblical account was full of conflict , pathos , tragedy , violence , bloodshed , and horror . "
It 's his Book of Revelation that lets these elements seamlessly combine with Wolverton 's artistic obsessions .
( Fantagraphics bow to chronology and put his end of the world at the end of their collection , despite the fact that Revelation was the first of Wolverton 's bible illustrations from the 1950s . )
His creatures from sci-fi and horror , his fascination with grotesque bodily exaggeration , his devout Christian faith -- here it all comes together into an operatic and apocalyptic peak .
The very first page ?
It 's captioned : " Hydrogen Bomb Over The City " .
It only gets worse from there .
Firestorms knock airplanes from the sky .
Earthquakes shatter cities .
Volcanos boil up from the earth .
Hailstones crush bodies beneath them .
No matter what disaster is taking place , Wolverton remembers to include mutated survivors , leering out of the darkness , all rotting teeth and hideous skin .
He draws mass graves in exquisite detail .
Then -- with no transition -- we 're suddenly in paradise ( Phew . )
Smiling faces !
The blind can see !
Children , patting once dangerous beasts !
Here the pictures are sparse and small : just a few quick sketches of heaven and a final image of a glowing city , impenetrable to the human eye .
Coming from a man who happily spent all that time and ink on diseased corpses , this eternal paradise obviously was n't all that artistically tempting .
It 's certainly much less convincing than the horrors that came before .
Everything else in the book , though , manages to look as strange and frightening as I thought Bible stories should be when I was ten years old .
Both Parker : The Hunter and The Wolverton Bible are odd , hybrid beasts .
Parker is designed to sit in a bookstore 's crime section , not with its graphic novels .
Cooke admits that he hopes both his fans and Westlake 's fans can agree on its worth and " broaden the reach of this wonderful medium . "
The Wolverton Bible might seem like a paradox to its religious audience and its alt - comics fans -- even if Wolverton himself never saw the contradiction .
In the end , these books do n't just provide idiosyncratic retellings and revisions of their originals ; they 're also both shamelessly evangelical .

Scientists hope data from Cryosat will show where Arctic ice is melting fastest The European space agency 's mission to assess the state of the world 's ice cover is likely to launch in February .
The Cryosat spacecraft will go into orbit on a Dnepr rocket from Baikonur , Kazakhstan , the agency has announced .
The satellite is a rebuild of the mission that was destroyed in 2005 when its launcher failed just minutes into its flight .
Cryosat - 2's radar instrument will make detailed maps of the ice that covers both sea and land at the poles .
Data from other satellites , such as the US Icesat and the European ERS / Envisat missions , has already indicated that some of this cover is diminishing at a rapid rate in response to climate change , with the biggest melting occurring in the Arctic .
Cryosat will add significantly to the information scientists already possess , making observations that are beyond the current generation of spacecraft .
Get ahead
The completed Cryosat - 2 is undergoing final checks here at the IABG technical centre in Ottobrunn near Munich , Germany , a test facility used by satellite manufacturers .
The mission is led scientifically from the UK , however .
Its principal investigator is Professor Duncan Wingham at University College London .
ESA'S EARTH EXPLORERS
Goce will map the subtle variations in Earth 's gravity field Smos ( above ) will study ocean salinity and soil moisture Cryosat - 2 is designed to map the Earth 's ice cover Aeolus will use an innovative laser to measure winds Swarm is a trio of satellites to map the Earth 's magnetism Earthcare will examine the formation and effects of clouds A.N.
Other will emerge from a current selection competition
It was hoped Cryosat - 2 could launch in December , but the flight has been delayed now until next year .
Esa said there was a queue of missions waiting for a ride on the Russian - Ukrainian Dnepr rocket , an intercontinental ballistic missile that has been converted for use by civil space programmes .
" Yes , it 's frustrating , but that 's how it is , " conceded Volker Liebig , Esa 's director of Earth observation programmes .
" On the other hand it gives us a little bit more time to [ train and prepare the ground team ] , which means when we do get into orbit we 'll be ready to start operations rapidly because of all the work we 've done in advance . "
Mission managers are targeting 28 February for a launch .
The inability of the agency to loft its satellites at a time of its choosing should become less of a problem when it has access to its new Vega rocket .
Vega , which will operate out of Europe 's Kourou spaceport in French Guiana , has been designed specifically to carry small institutional payloads such as Cryosat to orbit .
However , the rocket is not expected to enter into service until the middle of next year .
Cryosat - 2 is part of Esa's Earth Explorer programme - seven spacecraft that will do innovative science in obtaining data on issues of pressing environmental concern .
The first in the series , Goce ( Gravity Field and Steady - State Ocean Circulation ) , was launched in March .

A man was walking along a California beach and stumbled across an old lamp .
He picked it up and rubbed it and out popped a genie .
The genie said , " OK , OK .
You released me from the lamp ... yada yada yada !
This is the fourth time this month and I 'm getting a little sick of these wishes so you can forget about three of them .
You only get one wish ! "
The man sat and thought about it for a while and said , " I 've always wanted to go to Hawaii but I 'm scared to fly and I get very seasick .
Could you build me a bridge to Hawaii so I can drive over there to visit ? "
The genie laughed and said , " That 's impossible .
Think of the logistics of that !
How would the supports ever reach the bottom of the Pacific ?
Think of how much concrete ... how much steel !
Do you know how many engineers I would have to hire to figure how to do it ?
No , think of another wish . "
The man said OK and tried to think of a really good wish .
Finally , he said , " I 've been married and divorced four times .
My wives always said that I do n't care and that I 'm insensitive .
So , I wish that I could understand women ... know how they feel inside and what they 're thinking when they give me the silent treatment ... know why they 're crying , know what they really want when they say ' nothing ' ... know how to make them truly happy . "
The genie paused for a few minutes and then said , " You want that bridge with two lanes or four ? "
SPIEGEL Interview with Goldman Sachs CEO ' We Didn't Realize How Bad Things Would Get '
In a SPIEGEL interview , Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein , 55 , discusses his astronomical bonuses , the mistakes and failures of his bank prior to the start of the global financial crisis and his proposals for better regulating financial markets .
Author Chris Mooney ( of “ Storm World ” fame ) and fellow “ Intersection ” blogger , scientist , and writer Sheril Kirshenbaum have written an extraordinary , if rather sobering book entitled ‘ Unscientific America ’ .
What I found most refreshing about the book is that it not only isolates the history behind , and source of , the problem in question — the pervasiveness and dangerousness of scientific illiteracy in modern society – but it offers viable solutions .
This book is a must read for anybody who cares about science , and the growing disconnect between the scientific and popular cultures ( the problem of the so - called “ Two Cultures ” first discussed by C.P. Snow ) .
‘ Unscientific America ’ explores how we ’ve come to the point we ’re now at , examining the historical factors behind the diminishing prominence of science and scientists in the popular culture of the U.S. since its heyday in the years following WW II .
The authors uncover more than enough blame to go around .
They find fault with the media , both in how it portrays science and scientists ( e.g. the icon of the ‘ mad scientist ’ ) , and in the decreasing news coverage devoted to issues involving science and technology .
They find fault in the way policy makers often abuse science ( cherry - picking those particular scientific findings which suit their agenda ) , and in the behavior of corporate special interests who , in areas such as our own area of ‘ climate change ’ , have often deliberately manufactured false controversy and confusion to dissuade the public from demanding action be taken .
At this point , the scientists among you might begin to feel absolved of any responsibility for the problem .
Don’t–Mooney and Kirshenbaum wo n’t allow us to escape blame , and with good reason .
As they point out , we ‘ eat our own ’ , when it comes to colleagues engaged in public outreach and science popularization .
Case in point : Carl Sagan–a hero to many of us who value science outreach .
One of the darker episodes in modern U.S. science history was the blocking by Sagan ’s fellow scientists of his entry into the U.S. National Academy of Sciences .
Evidently , a majority of his colleagues resented his having become a household name –something they presumably considered unbecoming for a scientist .
What sort of message does it send when the most effective science communicator in modern history was shunned by his colleagues for his efforts ?
Certainly not a good one .
This is just one example , and there are many others–it is not surprising that so few scientists to choose to pursue the path of outreach and public education .
The reward systems in academia and the scientific world typically do not favor scientists who choose to expend considerable time and effort engaging in public discourse .
And here of course , it is as much that system , as the scientists themselves , which is to blame .
Given that we ( scientists ) are part of the problem , it must stand to reason that we are also part of the solution .
And indeed , this is a primary thesis advanced by Mooney and Kirshenbaum .
The authors argue that we must fundamentally reinvent the way that scientists are trained , so as to encourage and reward those who choose to serve as much - needed science liasons and science communicators .
Indeed , the reward system must be reworked in such a way as to facilitate the establishment of a whole new class of scientists , so - called ‘ science ambassadors ’ who are rigorously trained in science , but have the proclivity and ability to engage in the broader discourse and to help bridge the growing rift between the ‘ two cultures ’ .
We can no longer rely on pure serendipity that figures such as Sagan will just come along .
We must be proactive in establishing a pipeline of scientists who can fill this key niche .
In the absence of such intervention , the authors argue , the current rift between the “ two cultures ” will continue to grow , and the chasm between science on the one side , and popular culture and public policy - making on the other , will grow ever more dangerously wide .
Such was Carl Sagan ’s great fear , as revealed in his classic “ The Demon - Haunted world ” , published shortly before his untimely departure in 1996 .
To some , the authors could potentially come across as a bit overly prescriptive here .
One might interpret them as arguing that science needs to be taught in a fundamentally different way , with the new generation of science students fully immersed in the social sciences as part of an entirely rethought curriculum .
Were the authors arguing this , one might indeed expect quite a bit of push - back from the scientific community .
After all , the course work required to prepare today ’s science students for careers of advanced research in cosmology or genetics ( or climate modeling for that matter ) is extensive , and slapping a whole bunch of additional course requirements in , say , communication and sociology , on top of their current requirements would be onerous to say the least .
But this is not what the authors are saying ( I can say this with confidence , having confirmed this in my discussions with them ) .
To allow science to continue to flourish , it will of course be necessary to allow those scientists with neither the interest nor inherent aptitude for communication to continue to do science in the old fashioned way .
It would be an unwise use of our resources and theirs to push these reluctant individuals towards outreach .
What does make sense–and what the authors are indeed arguing for–is that we adapt the current system to facilitate the development of those individuals who are well suited to careers as ‘ science ambassadors ’ .
An appropriate step might be requiring science majors to take a course in college ( perhaps a so - called ‘ capstone ’ course taken in the senior year ) that focuses on the broader societal context within which the scientific topics they ’ve studied resides .
Some , perhaps even most , of these prospective future scientists will decide that they want no more of this–and that ’s fine .
Once again , we should not force those who are reluctant to follow this new path .
But hopefully the experience will identify , in a self - selecting manner , those scientists who do have broader interests and abilities in this area .
And for those who do , there needs to an entire academic infrastructure , ready to absorb them and to help prepare them to join the ranks of those much needed science ambassadors .
We need to be realistic in this venture of course .
These innovations may not yield another Carl Sagan .
But they will certainly move us in the right direction .
For those who believe that such dramatic changes in our way of doing things are not necessary –that the burgeoning litany of science blogs , such as RealClimate ( which does get several mentions in the book ! ) will help to insure the penetration of science back into popular culture , the authors have a disquieting message : an entire chapter entitled “ The Bloggers Cannot Save Us ” .
And to those who hope that the more forwarding - thinking attitude towards science within the current U.S. government signals the long - awaited stemming of the anti-science tide , the authors caution that the current crisis–such as the disappearance of science and technology journalism from our media–is far more fundamental and structural in nature .
‘ Unscientific America ’ is extremely well written , which is no surprise to those of us who follow Chris and Sheril ’s insightful blog postings .
Its also remarkably error free ( something I wish I could say about our own book “ Dire predictions ” –we still caught a few typos going into the 3rd printing ) .
Every review must find some fault , and so here ’s mine :
There is a very minor mistake .
The authors at one point refer to an exciting new venture known as “ Climate Central ” as being a Princeton University - affiliated effort .
Its not .
Other than being physically located in Princeton , and having some Princeton folks on board , there is no formal relationship with the university .
I doubt Princeton is going to sue however .
If it were up to me , this book would be required reading for all undergraduate science majors , along with Sagan ’s “ The Demon - Haunted World ” .
Only when we begin training scientists to understand the relationship between science and society , and their crucial role in that relationship , will be begin to solve the dilemma so eloquently described in ‘ Unscientific America ’ .
A Church of Scientology - backed organisation has distributed free DVDs about anti-depressant drugs in the area where killer Shane Clancy lived .
The group , called the Citizens Commission on Human Rights ( CCHR ) , has given out copies of a documentary to residents in the Dalkey area , just weeks after the tragic murder - suicide in Bray , Co Wicklow .
Reports have indicated that gardai are investigating whether Shane , who murdered Seb Creane ( 22 ) before killing himself , may have misused anti-depressants that had been prescribed for him a week before the tragic night .
The DVD , which is also available online , details interviews with psychiatrists , psychologists , and journalists , exposing what it calls " psychiatric violations of human rights . "
Making A Killing : The Untold Story Of Psychotropic Drugging is made in the US , but has been distributed in Ireland by a branch of the CCHR .
The DVD 's tagline says it tells the " story of big - money drugs that fuel a $ 330 bn psychiatric industry , without a single cure . "
But since its release , one professional involved with the DVD has distanced himself from the CCHR .
Professor Howard Brody said that he believes anything produced by this organisation requires independent confirmation .
He said : " I regret very much allowing myself to have become involved in this project and would like it to be known that I disown and disapprove of the final product and the way that it has been disseminated . "
One expert witness at the Columbine shootings has said that Shane Clancy may have reacted negatively to anti-depressants , affecting his state of mind at the time of the attack .
The executive director of the International Coalition for Drug Awareness , Dr Ann Tracy , believes that Shane may have lacked vital liver function necessary to metabolise anti-depressants .
The US - based doctor pointed out that if levels of anti-depressant in Shane 's blood were high , it does not necessarily mean that he was taking more than he should have .
She said : " It can mean that he , like seven to 10pc of the population , lacked the liver function necessary to break down the drug causing it to build to toxic levels . "
CCHR spokesman Brian Daniels said the DVD was intended to " let the public know what is going on . "
He said : " There are undiagnosed physical conditions which can manifest as mental illness . "

A natural chemical found in the sweat of men has been shown to act as a primitive love potion that increases their attractiveness in the eyes of women , a study has found .
The substance , which is derived from the male sex hormone testosterone , has a small but significant effect on judgements made by women in a speed - dating situation of a male stranger 's attractiveness .
Tamsin Saxton of the University of St Andrews studied the influence of androstadienone by dabbling a drop of it on the upper lip of 50 women who took part in the evening trial before they " dated " a series of men .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Women of all ages rated the men slightly higher on a scale of attractiveness when given the substance , compared to water or clove oil , but the effect was greatest in younger women aged between 18 and 22 , Dr Saxton said .
" For some of the women we gave them androstadienone and we put it in clove oil solution so they just smelt clove oil .
Some of the women had clove oil alone , and the third group had just water so there was no odour at all , " she told the British Science Festival .
" We got the women to mark how attractive they thought the men were on a one to seven scale after they interacted with each man , " she said .
" We found that the women given androstadienone had given slightly higher ratings of attractiveness to the men .
That suggested this constituent of sweat does seem to have some kind of impact on attraction , " she told the festival .
Little is known about androstadienone other than that it is found in human sweat , both in men and women , and that it is derived from testosterone .
" Some people do n't seem to be able to smell it all , some people say it smells OK or a bit sweaty , whereas others say it smells really awful , like babies ' nappies , " Dr Saxton said .
One hypothesis is that it could be a " pheromone " , or chemical messenger that acts between individuals in much the same way that hormones act as messengers within the body .
But the idea of human pheromones is highly controversial , she said .
" It 's something that people investigate on the topic of pheromones .
When you talk of animal pheromones , they are involved in very specific reactions , " Dr Saxton said .
" People do value somebody 's natural skin smell and it's worth bearing in mind that this may be part of your appeal - how you smell naturally , " she told the festival .
Bicycle injuries 14.5 % lower a year after the " Idaho Stop Law "
Laws that make the roadways safer for cyclists and motorists , while at the same time freeing up the traffic courts , police and judges to concentrate their precious time , energy and resources on dangerous criminals and drunk drivers should be adopted .
It ’s the “ All American ” thing to do .
As one who has represented injured cyclists and motorists throughout Loudoun , Fairfax and Leesburg , the Idaho Stop law makes sense and apparently saves lives as well .
According to research from the University of California ’s School of Public Health , the law has made roadways safer , while getting more people to commute by bike .
Carl Bianchi , a retired administrative director of Idaho ’s state courts who is widely considered the father of the Idaho Stop , said it was traffic judges — not cyclists — who pushed for the idea in 1982 , according to an April article in The Oregonian ( ‘ Idaho Stop ’ is a go for bicycle safety “ ) :
“ Police were ticketing bike riders for failing to come to a complete , foot - down stop .
Judges , however , saw “ technical violations ” clogging up their courts .
“ We recognized that the realities of bicycling were a lot different than driving a car , ” Bianchi said .
But the year after the Idaho Stop became law , bicycle injuries in the state actually declined by 14.5 percent .
Meanwhile , in the past 27 years , Idaho motorists and police have grown to accept the legislation as sensible public policy , said Jason Meggs , a UC - Berkeley researcher who spent last summer crunching years of traffic data , conducting interviews and observing cyclist behavior in the state .
Boise , home to Idaho ’s biggest bike population , “ has actually become safer for bicyclists than other cities which do n’t have the law , ” Meggs said . ”

Political reporter , BBC News , Lib Dem conference
Charles Kennedy is concerned about cuts proposals Former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy has warned successor Nick Clegg the party is in danger of losing its " heart " over proposed spending cuts .
He said party members were concerned when they heard " words like ' savage ' being bandied about " .
And they were against Mr Clegg 's proposals to drop a pledge to scrap university tuition fees in England .
Mr Kennedy was speaking in Bournemouth on the second day of the Lib Dem 's annual conference .
He told the BBC News Channel : " We have got to keep our head and make sure the numbers add up , in terms of public policy , but we have to show particular groups in society we have n't lost our hearts as well . "
Mr Clegg said the pledge could cost £ 12bn and he had to be " realistic " about whether it was affordable right now .
The possibility of scrapping one of the party 's flagship policies has risked putting Mr Clegg on a collision course with activists and influential figures on the left of the party .
The party 's Federal Policy Committee , which has the final say on the party 's programme for the next election , voted earlier this year to keep the policy .
We want to deliver that policy but it is a policy which has significant financial implications
Nick Clegg Many Lib
Dem supporters are worried that the policy , which they say distinguishes the party from Labour and the Conservatives , is being downgraded from a concrete goal to a long - term aspiration as all parties compete to identify spending cuts .
Earlier Mr Kennedy said the party should be " careful " about ditching policy promises such as tuition fees and free care for the elderly that are at the core of its values .
" I think that 's served us well but I think those are also defining features , if you like , of a Liberal Democrat society , " he told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme .
Asked if the tuition fees pledge should be retained , Mr Kennedy replied : " Well , I think so .
I think you should do so in terms of principle .
" And I think in addition if you simply look at the parliamentary reality , those age groups were very important to us at the last election , some of the gains that we made , not least against Labour . "
Former Lib Dem president Simon Hughes said the entire education budget should be protected during a future spending squeeze , describing it as " absolutely sacrosanct " .
He said the party was having an " honest " debate in public about what its priorities should be given the tight budgetary constraints .
Although that debate had not " concluded " , he said it was clear most party members wanted the fees pledge to be retained .
Mr Clegg and Treasury Spokesman Vince Cable have insisted that nothing is off - limits as they are determined to show they are serious about slashing spending to tackle Britain 's record national debt .
' No question mark '
Mr Clegg told party members on Sunday that the issue was one of affordability , not commitment , since experts had told him that the policy could cost £ 12.5 bn to implement over the next four years .
" There is no question mark over the policy of the Lib Dems on tuition fees , " he said .
" There is no question about my personal commitment to that policy .
The only question is when we can afford to scrap tuition fees . "
" We want to deliver that policy but it is a policy which has significant financial implications . "
Mr Clegg has warned of " serious and bold " cuts in spending under a Lib Dem administration - but said they will be in areas that allow vital public services to be protected .
Withdrawing tax credits from high earners and freezing public sector pensions were a price worth paying to ensure the party could cut class sizes , support disadvantaged pupils and keep key public sector workers in their jobs , he has argued .
The autumn conference is the last before the next general election , which must be held within the next nine months .

Dalton and Sam are male squirrel monkeys , about a foot tall .
Their ancestors lived by eating fruit and insects and dodging falcons in the forest canopy of Central and South America .
Dalton and Sam lead a more protected life in the laboratory of Jay and Maureen Neitz at the University of Washington , Seattle .
Recently , the Neitzes endowed them with a new genetic gift : the ability to see the world with full color vision .
Male squirrel monkeys have only two of the color pigments known as opsins , unlike people who have three .
The Neitzes , with Katherine Mancuso and other colleagues , used the technique of gene therapy to introduce the gene for the missing red pigment into the cone cells of the monkeys ’ retinas .
Several months after the therapy , Dalton and Sam were able to see a world in which red hues were visible and oranges no longer looked like lemons , the researchers say in the current issue of Nature .
Although the monkeys could not report that they saw the world with new eyes , their ability to do so was judged by their performance on a color - vision test with a reward of fruit juice .
Jay Neitz said Dalton was named for John Dalton , who not only invented modern atomic theory but in 1794 was also the first person to describe color blindness  his own .
Microsoft and Its Employees Surpass $ 2.5 Billion Mark Through Charitable Donations
Jeff Raikes ( second from right ) , president of Microsoft 's Business Division , presents a check to Paul Lambros ( third from right ) , executive director of Plymouth Housing Group , a donation that vaulted Microsoft 's giving to more than US $ 2.5 billion in 20 years .
About the Author
Microsoft.comToday at Microsoft Corp.'s annual company meeting , Microsoft announced that the company has surpassed a mark that will not show up on a stock ticker or retail shelves .
Since 1983 , Microsoft and its employees have given more than $ 2.5 billion in cash , services and software to nonprofits around the world through localized , company - sponsored giving and volunteer campaigns .
At the meeting , Business Division President Jeff Raikes , along with his wife , Tricia Raikes , who are co-chairs of the 2006 community campaign for The United Way of King County , presented a check from Microsoft for $ 150,000 to Plymouth Housing Group , bringing the company 's overall giving beyond the $ 2.5 billion milestone .
Paul Lambros , executive director of Plymouth Housing Group , was joined onstage by dozens of representatives from other nonprofits , who saluted the company and its employees for their generosity .
" On behalf of everyone at Plymouth and all of the organizations you support so generously , I 'd like to thank each and every one of you at Microsoft for your dedication to giving back to your communities , " Lambros said .
" The $ 2.5 billion milestone , and the fact that I 'm surrounded by dozens of my colleagues , is testimony to the scope and breadth of your giving over the past two decades .
" The gifts and volunteerism among Microsoft employees , Raikes said , represent the collective power of how 70,000 people can make a difference in communities around the globe .
"
The true impact of this philosophy of giving , " Raikes said , " is everyday support for food banks , homeless shelters , refugee protection and emergency relief efforts , youth programs , teen counseling and domestic violence sanctuaries , cancer research and health clinics , and efforts to provide technology access and training to underserved citizens of the world .
This company and its employees are a powerful force for positive change in communities worldwide .
" According to Raikes , in 2005 Microsoft employees donated and the company matched $ 68.2 million in cash and software .
In addition , Microsoft directed more than $ 40 million in cash to nonprofits through Unlimited Potential , a global program designed to help broaden digital inclusion and aid global work - force development by providing technology skills through community technology centers .
This giving from Microsoft and its employees is separate from grants or donations given by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .
A Culture of Giving and Volunteering
This philosophy of philanthropy is deeply rooted in the company 's culture worldwide .
Microsoft encourages employees to get involved in their communities through several programs that make it easy to volunteer time , offering employees in some international Microsoft offices three to five days of paid volunteer leave each fiscal year .
In the United States , Microsoft matches each employee contribution � up to $ 12,000 annually ; this includes a match for gifts of time as well as money .
When employees volunteer their time in the community , Microsoft donates $ 17 per every hour volunteered to the eligible organizations they serve .
This program has been in place for only one year , and already employees have volunteered for more than 110,000 hours .
Major SponsorshipsAlthough hundreds of organizations across the spectrum of charitable causes receive some level of support from Microsoft employees , some , such as Boys & Girls Clubs of America and the American Red Cross , have received sizable contributions of time , money and resources over the years .
For nearly 20 years Microsoft has been supporting the Boys & Girls Clubs of America .
In 2000 , the company announced a national partnership with the Boys & Girls Club � called Club Tech � and a historic $ 100 million gift that has helped provide technology access and skills training to more than 4.4 million kids in 3,900 Boys & Girls Clubs across the United States .
"
No individual , company or government entity has done more for our kids than Microsoft , " said Daniel Johnson , president and CEO of the King County Boys & Girls Clubs .
" Not only do Microsoft volunteers tend to be the most driven , passionate and productive among our army of volunteers , but we use Microsoft� tools , human capital and financial resources every day to improve the lives of kids and make the organization stronger .
" Microsoft 's giving to the American Red Cross was most visible in the wake of the Hurricane Katrina disaster in 2005 .
Beyond gifts of financial support , Microsoft employees worked closely with Red Cross staff members and volunteers during the disaster response and beyond .
This included engineering teams dispatched to Red Cross headquarters in Washington , D.C. , shortly after Katrina 's landfall and development of a next - generation system to connect people separated during disasters .
" The American Red Cross is extremely grateful to Microsoft and its employees for their extraordinary compassion , rapid mobilization and massive response to the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina , " said Steve Cooper , chief information officer for the American Red Cross .
" Your desire to aid a nation in crisis healed wounds across the country � from uniting families through the development of Katrinasafe.org and dispatching mobile communications vehicles to deploying technology to aid evacuees in your local King County Red Cross chapter .
" Founded in 1975 , Microsoft ( Nasdaq " MSFT " ) is the worldwide leader in software , services and solutions that help people and businesses realize their full potential .
G20 security officials took responsibility Friday afternoon for a video that seemed to depict US troops ‘ kidnapping ’ a protester .
The military was not involved in the incident , but G20 security did acknowledge that “ law enforcement officers from a multi-agency tactical response team ” had detained a protester they said was believed to be vandalizing a store .

Video posted at YouTube shows onlookers calling out “ what the fuck ” and “ what the fuck is wrong with you ? ” as people in camo uniforms haul a protester along by his collar , shove him into the back seat of a car , and rapidly drive off .
Officials with G20 security released the following statement to Raw Story and other media outlets :
“ Military members supporting the G20 Summit work with local law enforcement authorities but do not have the authority to make arrests .
The individuals involved in the 9/24/09 arrest which has appeared online are law enforcement officers from a multi-agency tactical response team assigned to the security operations for the G20 .
It is not unusual for tactical team members to wear camouflaged fatigues .
The type of fatigues the officers wear designates their unit affiliation .
Prior to the arrest , the officers observed this subject vandalizing a local business .
Due to the hostile nature of the crowd , officer safety and the safety of the person under arrest , the subject was immediately removed from the area . ”
The video was featured this morning at the Drudge Report under the heading , “ SEE U.S. MILITARY SNATCH PROTESTER … . ”

At the liberal website Democratic Underground , one commenter asserted , “ This is staged ” and then claimed , “ Those were not the uniforms National Guard / military were wearing yesterday .
Neither was that the vehicles they were driving .
This was just a bunch of idiots trying to make some point . ”
According to news reports , “ U.S. authorities assembled a security force of nearly 5,000 people to safeguard the event , including 2,500 National Guard troops , 1,200 state troopers , 875 Pittsburgh city police and small groups of officers from other agencies . ”
Police and National Guard troops headed off an unauthorized march by some 1000 protesters on Thursday and eventually forced the crowd to scatter .

The police reaction to the protests has been marked by what antiwar activist Cindy Sheehan calls “ profound overkill . ”
“ I have been to dozens of protests , large and small , since my son was killed in Iraq , but I have never seen anything like today , ” Sheehan writes .
“ There were easily two cops / soldiers for every one of us protesters or maybe even 3 to 1 . ”

Sheehan also witnessed the National Guard troops working with the local police and comments , “ Seeing the National Guard troops , fresh from Iraq , broke my heart the hardest .
I also talked to dozens of them , none had ever heard of posse commitatus , and asked them if my son , their brother , died in Iraq so they could steal the rights of his mother .
Most of them would n’t even look at me . ”

ANTANANARIVO ( Reuters ) - Endangered lemur species found only in Madagascar are being slaughtered and served up in local restaurants as poachers take advantage of a security vacuum on the island after a coup earlier this year .

Pictures of the blackened remains of scores of crowned lemurs and golden crowned sifakas , smoked in preparation for transport , have been released by the environmental protection group Conservation International .
James Mackinnon , technical director at the group ’s Madagascar office , said gangs were pillaging the forests of precious hardwoods and trapping rare animals for Asia ’s pet market , unwinding hard - fought conservation gains on the island .
“ Lemurs have always been hunted on a small , subsistence scale .
This is bigger , more organized and systematic and it ’s typical of what we ’ve been seeing with the breakdown in law and order , ” he told Reuters on Friday .
Conservationists say biodiversity on the world ’s fourth largest island is being wiped out on a shocking scale .
Foreign donors , who provided the bulk of funding for the country ’s national parks and environmental programs , suspended aid after Andry Rajoelina toppled the island ’s president with the help of renegade troops in March .
Operating on a shoestring budget , the authorities have been unable to control the surge in criminal activity .
The Indian Ocean island , isolated from other land masses for more than 160 million years , is a biodiversity “ hotspot ” home to hundreds of exotic species found nowhere else in the world .
ENVIRONMENTAL CATASTROPHE
Poachers are using slingshots and traps to hunt the lemurs in Daraina , a newly - protected region in the far north of Madagascar .
Only 8,000 golden crowned sifaka , found only in Daraina , remain in the wild and risk being wiped out in weeks .
“ More than anything else , these poachers are killing the goose that laid the golden egg , ” said Russ Mittermeier , president of Conservation International .
“ ( They are ) wiping out the very animals that people most want to see and undercutting the country and especially local communities by robbing them of future eco-tourism revenue . ”
The island ’s wildlife was popularized in the 2005 DreamWorks animated movie Madagascar and its 2008 sequel , voiced by stars including Ben Stiller and Sacha Baron Cohen as the lemur king .
Eco-tourism is the backbone of Madagascar ’s $ 390 million - a- year tourism industry , which has been wrecked by months of political turmoil .
Decades of logging , mining and slash - and - burn farming have destroyed up to 90 percent of the island ’s natural ecology .
Ousted leader Marc Ravalomanana was credited by conservationists with increasing the number of national parks and protected areas , backed by donors including the World Bank and the United States .
Conservation International described the move to cut environmental aid as a “ knee - jerk reaction . ”
To deny conservation funding was counter - productive , it said , as it simply encouraged poor governance of natural resources .
Mackinnon warned of impending environmental catastrophe , saying there was a real danger parks would be forced to lay off rangers and cease to function before the end of the year .
“ It ’s very hard to turn the clock back once criminal activities have become ingrained , ” he said .
Scientists believe that a nap can boost creative thought and help problem - solving .
So what major breakthroughs in science and the arts have been made during sleep ?
The old adage " I 'll sleep on it " may have some truth in it , after all .
A study by researchers at the University of California San Diego has concluded that problems are more likely to be solved after a period of dreamy ( rapid eye movement ) sleep .
Scientists believe so - called REM sleep allows the brain to form new nerve connections without the interference of other thought pathways that occur when we are awake or in non-dreamy sleep .
Anecdotal evidence from some key figures in the arts and science suggests there could be some truth in this .
Here are some examples of major discoveries made in dreams .
THE SONG Yesterday by The Beatles is one of the world 's most well - known songs and according to the Guinness Book of Records , the song with the most cover versions .
Paul McCartney has spoken about how the melody came to him in a dream .
He was staying in a small attic room in London in 1965 , while the band were filming Help !.
He woke up with a tune in his head , he said , and immediately decided to play it .
" I got out of bed , sat at the piano , found G , found F sharp minor 7th - and that leads you through then to B to E minor , and finally back to E .
It all leads forward logically .
" I liked the melody a lot , but because I 'd dreamed it , I could n't believe I 'd written it .
I thought , ' No , I 've never written anything like this before . '
But I had the tune , which was the most magic thing ! "
He was still unsure whether he had merely repeated someone else 's song so he played it to anyone who would listen , but no - one could identify it .
Many fans have tried to do the same .
THE MONSTER
In the summer of 1816 , Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin , 19 , and her lover Percy Shelley , visited the poet Lord Byron at his villa near Lake Geneva in Switzerland .
In her dreams ... and your nightmares
Weather frequently forced them and other guests indoors , where they read ghost stories , prompting their host Byron to challenge them to write one themselves .
Wollstonecraft Godwin , later Mary Shelley through marriage , has described how her famous work Frankenstein was inspired by a waking dream she had that night in Byron 's villa .
In the introduction to the book , she explained what she saw : " With shut eyes , but acute mental vision , I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together .
I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out , and then , on the working of some powerful engine , show signs of life , and stir with an uneasy , half - vital motion . "
The morning after her dream , she wrote what later became the first words of Chapter Five : " It was on a dreary night of November ... "
THE NOBEL PRIZE - WINNING DISCOVERY
Dr Otto Loewi is described as the " father of neuroscience " and won the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1936 .
But that was the fruition of 16 years of work that began after one particularly productive night 's sleep .

The end of Handel 's Messiah Bram Stoker 's Dracula
In 1903 the German had first had the idea that there might be a chemical transmission of the nervous impulse .
But in the years that followed he had failed to prove his theory , until Easter Saturday 1920 , when he dreamt about it .
He awoke in the night and made some notes , but the next morning he could not read his scribbles .
However , that night the idea returned to him as he slept .
It was the design of an experiment to prove his theory , and it turned out to be the foundation for the work that years later won him the Nobel Prize .
THE WORLD - CLASS GOLF SWING
Even the sporting greats have the odd slump in form .
In 1964 , after rediscovering his touch following a run of poor scores , golfer Jack Nicklaus told the San Francisco Chronicle how it happened .
" Wednesday night I had a dream and it was about my golf swing .
I was hitting them pretty good in the dream and all at once I realized I was n't holding the club the way I 've actually been holding it lately .
" I 've been having trouble collapsing my right arm taking the club head away from the ball , but I was doing it perfectly in my sleep .
" So when I came to the course yesterday morning I tried it the way I did in my dream and it worked .
I shot a 68 yesterday and a 65 today . "
THE MATHEMATICAL THEORY Indian maths genius Srinivasa Ramanujan was invited to Cambridge University in 1914 by English mathematician GH Hardy .
They collaborated productively for five years , making a series of breakthroughs , especially in number theory .
Mr Ramanujan claimed he drew inspiration for his analysis in his dreams .
He used to say that the Hindu goddess Namagiri would appear to him and present him with the formulae , which he would check after waking .

When I was doing my undergraduate degree at University , I had been working on a problem on solid mechanics as part of the final coursework .
I had been trying to solve this problem for the entire day and finally i went to bed very tired without finding a solution .
I remember I dreamt of this problem , and in my dream I was developing a methodology to solve it , step by step .
When I wake up , I remembered my dream , including the mathematical operations required ( not actually the calculations ) and the data needed to be considered for the solution .
I went to my desk and solved the problem in 15 minutes !
I was really amazed .

Such tales sound pretentious , unless one has seen this phenomenon in action .
As a teenager , I commuted to work with my father , and he would explain solutions to mechanical and design problems that we had discussed only 10 hours before .
He still ' works in his sleep ' , but most people now understand it is absolutely genuine .
Sadly , this grand trait is not a genetic inheritance .

Tell us something new !
I have been doing this for years and it is very true , I very often figure out projects and ideas when asleep ,
In fact I find my mind needs something to dwell on at night and hates to have an empty vacuum to dwell on at night and can get very depressed and morbid if allowed to wander .
So I find myself looking for something to ponder and fall asleep to find it 's solved in the morning .
Andy , Teignmouth Hmm .. it 's a shame to point out that these are classic myths and there is evidence to show that they were stories concocted after the event to fit with popular conceptions of genius and creativity .
Its certainly true that relaxing and thinking about something else can indeed help but some of the specific stories here are n't correct when you look at the historical records of the time .
Rather like the many writers who claim that the words just poured out onto the paper from their mind , when later researchers discover stashes of earlier drafts !

Flower , Cambridge I have been thinking about aerodynamic drag theory as part of my PhD and got stuck on a problem .
I stopped thinking about it for a few weeks because I did not know how to progress .
A few days ago , with my brain in standby mode as I slept , the aerodynamic problem was solved all in the mind .
I woke up , re-did the maths and hey presto the problem is solved .
This is not the first time it has happened to me .
The light bulb has come on many times in the last three years .

It 's well - known that you wake up in the middle of the night with insights into logical problems .
These have to be written down immediately - but very carefully so you can read / understand the idea the next day .
Sometimes the answer is fatally flawed - but very often it is a neat lateral solution .
It 's worked for me in my successful trouble - shooting career for over 40 years .
ChrisJK , UK A nice article , and the comments reinforce the view expressed .
Earlier quite systematic studies suggest that the process may occur in a state of relaxation , often but not always just before sleep and waking .
Other comfort zones may be culture dependent .
Mathematical breakthroughs seem particularly susceptible through such a process .
Tudor Rickards , Manchester I often wake up with the solutions to tricky programming problems I had been tackling the day before .
Can I claim overtime for the extra hours spent working on the problem ?

More than 2.5 million students will pay 0 % rate of interest on their loans from September , the government announced yesterday .
Hopes were raised last month that students would effectively earn money on loans after the Retail Prices Index ( RPI ) , to which they are linked , dropped to - 0.4 % .
The Student Loans Company ( SLC ) , which manages the government 's financial support for students , said the decision had been taken because student loans are already well subsidised , and it would be difficult to justify to taxpayers a situation whereby students take out loans in 2009 - 10 and have their balances immediately reduced .
The 0 % interest rate for the next academic year will mean no change in borrowers ' monthly repayments , but graduates will pay off their loans quicker than they would have done if interest was being added to the loan .
In a statement , the SLC said : " Borrowers repay 9 % of their earnings over the income threshold of £ 15,000 .
Whatever the rate of interest is , that monthly repayment will not change . "
The new rate will affect those with outstanding student loans taken out after September 1998 as well as applicants for both maintenance loans and tuition fee loans in the current and next academic year .
But loans taken out before 1998 will attract a negative rate of interest of - 0.4 % .
These loans are repaid through a fixed term , " mortgage - style " scheme , where the interest rate is linked solely to the RPI , making the interest rate for September 2009 to 31 August 2010 - 0.4 % .
Wes Streeting , president of the National Union of Students , said : " We are pleased that the government has listened to the NUS 's concerns about how badly graduates are being affected by the current economic crisis .
" In the context of a recession , this is the best deal students and graduates could have expected . "
He said the NUS would continue to monitor student loan interest rates and make sure ministers were aware of students ' concerns .
" In addition , we repeat our call for the government to look carefully at the issue of the rate used to calculate interest on student loans , in the forthcoming wider review of higher education funding and student support , " he said .
At this 3rd anniversary of the launch of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud ( Amazon EC2 ) , it is amazing to see the impact this service has had on the industry .
It is truly disruptive technology and its impact has reached far beyond a pure technology offering as the benefits of the cloud have changed the way we view IT Infrastructure .
As one of the CIOs at the ACM Cloud Computing Roundtable summarized it : " IT used to be the blocker in anything we did , but with our shift to the cloud IT is now the enabler . "
From young businesses and established enterprises to hospitals and governments agencies , all are equally enthusiastic cloud customers for whom IT infrastructure has changed forever .
Even though we keep rolling out new services and features , and several existing AWS services are already very successful , this is still Day One .
We are only at the brink of what is possible to deliver in the cloud and at Amazon we continue to innovate to make this future a reality .
We continuously listen to our customers to make sure our roadmap matches their needs .
One important piece of feedback that mainly came from our enterprise customers was that the transition to the cloud of more complex enterprise environments was challenging .
We made it a priority to address this and have worked hard in the past year to find new ways to help our customers transition applications and services to the cloud , while protecting their investments in their existing IT infrastructure .
Protecting investments during the transition
Most enterprises with a datacenter practice have invested significantly over the past decade into the management of their systems and applications .
CIOs of Fortune 500 companies are responsible for hundreds if not thousands of applications running in a variety of locations .
Keeping track of those resources and managing access to them is a daunting task that continues to require significant investment .
The CIO of a large financial services company in the Northeast explained to me that his teams manage close to 3000 applications and services in 27 different locations .
Consolidation of applications , resources and locations is a process that never stops in a world where mergers and acquisitions happen frequently .
For him the cloud is attractive as a target for his consolidated services : it allows him to significantly reduce both his capital and operational costs , while gaining significant flexibility and reliability with resources that are globally distributed , without the headache of owning and maintaining them .
He has set the guideline that their current data center infrastructure should not expand any further and that all new development will target the cloud .
He expects that the process of moving his existing applications and services to the cloud will take time to complete , as his road map is driven by many internal and external factors .
And there are certainly some legacy applications that may never move .
He has set the goal of moving 20 % of his applications into the cloud by the end of 2010 , but to meet this goal he needed to find a solution for a significant obstacle : how to integrate applications running in the cloud into his existing management frameworks .
In his world , this especially applies to those management practices that manage policy - driven access controls and required , cross-application regulatory auditing .
This story is typical of many of the conversations I have had with CIOs around the globe .
They have bought into the cloud as a target for a significant portion of their services , as the benefits are too obvious to ignore , and most expect that their transition will be a continuous process .
They would accelerate the adoption of cloud services if they could access a form of cloud that would give them the best of both worlds : the flexibility and cost - effectiveness of accessing a virtually infinite pool of resources without owning it , while being able to integrate those resources into their existing datacenter environments such that they could continue to leverage existing investments in their management and control infrastructure .
Private Cloud is not the Cloud
These CIOs know that what is sometimes dubbed " private cloud " does not meet their goal as it does not give them the benefits of the cloud : true elasticity and capex elimination .
Virtualization and increased automation may give them some improvements in utilization , but they would still be holding the capital , and the operational cost would still be significantly higher .
I often get asked to define " The Cloud , " especially because of the many permutations that different vendors use in trying to make their existing businesses look like a cloud offering .
I define the cloud by it benefits , as those are very clear .
What are called private clouds have little of these benefits and as such , I do n't think of them as true clouds .
The cloud :
Eliminates Cost .
The cloud changes capital expense to variable expense and lowers operating costs .
The utility - based pricing model of the cloud combined with its on - demand access to resources eliminates the needs for capital investments in IT Infrastructure .
And because resources can be released when no longer needed , effective utilization rises dramatically and our customers see a significant reduction in operational costs .

Is Elastic .
The ready access to vast cloud resources eliminates the need for complex procurement cycles , improving the time - to - market for its users .
Many organizations have deployment cycles that are counted in weeks or months , while cloud resources such as Amazon EC2 only take minutes to deploy .
The scalability of the cloud no longer forces designers and architects to think in resource - constrained ways and they can now pursue opportunities without having to worry how to grow their infrastructure if their product becomes successful .

The scalability of the cloud no longer forces designers and architects to think in resource - constrained ways and they can now pursue opportunities without having to worry how to grow their infrastructure if their product becomes successful .
Removes Undifferentiated " Heavy Lifting .
" The cloud let its users focus on delivering differentiating business value instead of wasting valuable resources on the undifferentiated heavy lifting that makes up most of IT infrastructure .
Over time Amazon has invested over $ 2B in developing technologies that could deliver security , reliability and performance at tremendous scale and at low cost .
Our teams have created a culture of operational excellence that power some of the world 's largest distributed systems .
All of this expertise is instantly available to customers through the AWS services .
Elasticity is one of the fundamental properties of the cloud that drives many of its benefits .
While virtualization has tremendous benefits to the enterprise , certainly as an important tool in server consolidation , it by itself is not sufficient to give the benefits of the cloud .
To achieve true cloud - like elasticity in a private cloud , such that you can rapidly scale up and down in your own datacenter , will require you to allocate significant hardware capacity .
While to your internal customers it may appear that they have increased efficiency , at the company level you still own all the capital expense of the IT infrastructure .
Without the diversity and heterogeneity of the large number of AWS cloud customers to drive a high utilization level , it can never be a cost - effective solution .
We have been listening very closely to the real requirements that our customers have and have worked closely with many of these CIOs and their teams to understand what solution would allow them to treat the cloud as a seamless extension of their datacenter , where their standard management practices can be applied with limited or no modifications .
This needs to be a solution where they get all the benefits of cloud as mentioned above while treating it as a part of their datacenter .
Introducing Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
We have developed Amazon Virtual Private Cloud ( Amazon VPC ) to allow our customers to seamlessly extend their IT infrastructure into the cloud while maintaining the levels of isolation required for their enterprise management tools to do their work .
With Amazon VPC you can :
Create a Virtual Private Cloud and assign an IP address block to the VPC .
The address block needs to be CIDR block such that it will be easy for your internal networking to route traffic to and from the VPC instance .
These are addresses you own and control , most likely as part of your current datacenter addressing practice .
and assign an IP address block to the VPC .
The address block needs to be CIDR block such that it will be easy for your internal networking to route traffic to and from the VPC instance .
These are addresses you own and control , most likely as part of your current datacenter addressing practice .
Divide the VPC addressing up into subnets in a manner that is convenient for managing the applications and services you want run in the VPC .

Create a VPN connection between the VPN Gateway that is part of the VPC instance and an IPSec - based VPN router on your own premises .
Configure your internal routers such that traffic for the VPC address block will flow over the VPN .
between the VPN Gateway that is part of the VPC instance and an IPSec - based VPN router on your own premises .
Configure your internal routers such that traffic for the VPC address block will flow over the VPN .
Start adding AWS cloud resources to your VPC .
These resources are fully isolated and can only communicate to other resources in the same VPC and with those resources accessible via the VPN router .
Accessibility of other resources , including those on the public internet , is subject to the standard enterprise routing and firewall policies .
Amazon VPC offers customers the best of both the cloud and the enterprise managed data center :
Full flexibility in creating a network layout in the cloud that complies with the manner in which IT resources are managed in your own infrastructure .
Isolating resources allocated in the cloud by only making them accessible through industry standard IPSec VPNs .
Familiar cloud paradigm to acquire and release resources on demand within your VPC , making sure that you only use those resources you really need .
Only pay for what you use .
The resources that you place within a VPC are metered and billed using the familiar pay - as - you - go approach at the standard pricing levels published for all cloud customers .
The creation of VPCs , subnets and VPN gateways is free of charge .
VPN usage and VPN traffic are also priced at the familiar usage based structure
All the benefits from the cloud with respect to scalability and reliability , freeing up your engineers to work on things that really matter to your business .

A while back , I described what I saw as a characteristic of reactionaries to “ internalize ” an exaggerated view of their enemies ’ ideology and tactical supremacy .
Because of this , I wrote :
What ends up happening in many of these reactionary groups is that they construct themselves on a model based on their worst fears of their enemy .
I cited a few examples – from the John Birch Society organizing in self - sufficient cells like they imagined the Communists did to Dick Cheney ’s presumption that terroristic violence was supremely effective .
Now , with the rise of the anti-health insurance reform movement , we see another example of a reactionary movement that has internalized an exaggerated view of their enemy – and then adopted it for themselves .
As David Weigel firmly establishes in a piece for the Washington Independent , the tactics and strategies behind these town hall disruptions and other attempts to block health insurance reform are linked to the right - wingers ’ reading of Saul Alinsky – who many right - wingers see as Obama ’s closest mentor ( though Obama never met him . )
Alinsky and his methods were widely discussed by right wingers in the lead up to the election – and they took on the air of a biblical text after it – as every word or action by the Obama administration has been explained by reference to an obscure reference to something Alinsky wrote .
The interest of the right - wing in Alinsky has actually caused his books to jump up the book charts .
( Tellingly , Amazon ’s reccomendation engine demonstrates in its “ Users Who Purchased This Item Also Bought ” section that the buyers are mainly right - wing . )
And a new book will be coming out soon adopting Alinsky ’s techniques for right - wing activists .
Though these right wingers have taken to calling themselves “ Alinsky - cons , ” one thing these right wing activists seem to have missed about Alinsky was his focus on community organizing and engagement with power .
This is the part of Alinsky that Obama has adopted – as he has sought to demonstrate his good faith to his opponents , and to engage them as if they were acting in good faith – in other words , to use civility and respect as political weapons .
As Mark Schmitt wrote in piece for The American Prospect :
One way to deal with that kind of bad - faith opposition is to draw the person in , treat them as if they were operating in good faith , and draw them into a conversation about how they actually would solve the problem .
If they have nothing , it shows .
And that ’s not a tactic of bipartisan Washington idealists – it ’s a hard - nosed tactic of community organizers , who are acutely aware of power and conflict .
It ’s how you deal with people with intractable demands – put ‘em on a committee .
Then define the committee ’s mission your way .
But these right wing protesters are not trying to demonstrate their good faith efforts to engage with reality and to win over undecideds .
Instead , they are seeking to stop debate and discussion and to deliberately simulate that their opinions are common .
They offer no solutions to the problems health insurance reform addresses – only chants to be used to overpower those who want to discuss the solutions they are offering .
One veteran community organizer and a student of Alinsky ’s method described his response to the right wing adoption of Alinsky :
“ They polarize , ” said Galluzzo .
“ They ’ve got that part down .
They do direct action .
But that ’s not the kind of organizing we do .
We end up building relationships with the people we oppose .
I ’m not going to go up to Mayor [ Richard ] Daley and say ‘ you ’re just a Nazi . ’
I want to end up working with him . ”
But according to Galluzzo , if Alinsky could take a look at the Alinsky - cons , he ’d call them “ petty protesters ” who want to destroy the system without offering solutions .
“ If you just go around calling people assholes , ” Galluzzo said , “ you ’re not going to get anything done . ”
While Alinsky ’s methods were designed to force those in power to be accountable to the people they have power over , these Alinsky - cons have adapted Saul Alinsky ’s methods to simulate a large opposition .
As an influential memo by one of the right wing groups organizing these sessions advises :
Spread out in the hall and try to be in the front half .
The Rep should be made to feel that a majority , and if not , a significant portion of at least the audience , opposes the socialist agenda of Washington .
And while Alinsky ’s methods are supposed to start a conversation with those in power , the methods of the Alinsky - cons have a different aim – as Paul Grenier quoted a right wing organizing memo in the Baltimore Sun :
Try to rattle [ the congressman ] , not have an intelligent debate .
The deliberate method of these Alinsky - cons is to distract the public from the actual reforms at issue – by combining Rovian fear - mongering with Alinsky ’s disruptive methods .
And what you get is a big mess – and the preservation of the unsustainable status quo .

NATO troops freed a kidnapped New York Times reporter in a raid before dawn today in northern Afghanistan , after he had been held for four days , an Afghan district chief said .
A witness said the reporter ’s Afghan interpreter was killed .
Reporter Stephen Farrell was abducted Saturday along with the interpreter while trying to visit the scene of a NATO airstrike .
Abdul Waheed Omarkheil , district chief of Char Dara district in Kunduz province , said commandos had freed Farrell .

The district chief said an Afghan woman was killed during the raid in the house where the two men were being held .
He had no information about the fate of the interpreter .
Mohammad Nabi , a resident of the district , said Taliban fighters with the two captives had stayed at his house that night after demanding shelter .
He said NATO forces arrived by helicopter and killed his sister - in - law in the raid .
The troops left with Farrell , but not the interpreter , whose body was found outside the house in the morning , Nabi told Reuters .
" Teaching how to disarm is one thing but there is no way he should be showing people how to kill .
He 's not welcome here . "
U.S. Taxpayers Fund Empty ' Airports to Nowhere ' Millions in stimulus funds get diverted to empty but expensive airports .
Sept. 18 , 2009  --
The Greenbrier Valley Airport , the gateway to the ritzy Greenbrier resort where rooms start at $ 500 a night , is about to get more than $ 2 million in federal stimulus funds to spruce up the terminal building .
Only two commercial flights a day come in and out of the Lewisburg , W.Va. , airport and , on average , each plane carries six passengers .
But U.S. tax dollars keep the airport in business .
In addition to stimulus funds the airport received , the federal government subsidizes the commercial flights to the tune of $ 562 per passenger through the FAA 's Essential Air Service program , which supports rural airports through a $ 175 million annual appropriation .
Indeed , dozens of small , U.S. airports depend on federal funds for their survival , prompting critics to complain that these " airports to nowhere " fly too few passengers to justify the subsidies .
But Greenbrier residents , for instance , insist that the money is well spent .
" The most important thing we can have is an easier way for the guests to get to the Greenbrier , " said Lynn Swann , a spokeswoman for the Greenbrier resort .
" That does n't benefit just the Greenbrier , it benefits the entire region .
" We have 1,300 employees here , " she said , " but numerous businesses in the area , whether they are tourist destinations , restaurants , other hotels or simply gas stations , [ also ] benefit from increased business at the Greenbrier . "
Greenbrier Airport manager Jerry O'Sullivan agreed , saying federal subsidies for small airports like his are essential to local economies .
" In Washington terms , $ 175 million is really just a rounding error , " O'Sullivan said .
" And to cancel [ the funds ] would be too widespread pain for too little gain . "
Dozens of Small Airports Snag Millions in Federal Funds
In Alaska , millions of federal dollars are going to tiny airports that make the Greenbrier look as busy as the O'Hare International Airport in Chicago .
ABC News visited Ouzinkie Airport , on a remote island near Kodiak , Alaska , which just hit the jackpot with $ 15 million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 -- $ 100,000 for each of the town 's 150 residents , even though there is another airport 30 minutes away .
" That 's an awful lot of money for a little village , " resident William Delgado said , laughing .
" I do n't know how it happened but it happened . "
The stimulus money was awarded after the state applied to the Federal Aviation Administration for its piece of the stimulus pie .
Four other tiny Alaska airports received money as well .
" Our rural citizens have the same needs as our urban citizens and we are not in a position to judge which are more important , " said Christine Klein , deputy commissioner of the Alaska Department of Transportation .
But critics call them " airports to nowhere . "
The most well - known is the John Murtha Airport in western Pennsylvania , a monument to powerful Democratic congressman John Murtha that has received about $ 200 million in federal money in the past 15 years .
The airport averages 20 passengers a day for its three commercial flights to Washington , D.C .
" It 's a breeze to get through security , [ there are ] no crowds and it's right in your backyard , " one passenger at the Murtha Airport told ABC News in April .
" Definitely nicer than packing up early in the morning and traveling to Pittsburgh . "
The federal government provides a subsidy for every flight into the Murtha Airport of about $ 100 dollars per passenger but , even with the subsidy , there are plenty of empty seats .
Still , that has n't compelled lawmakers to curb funding for the facility .
Out of the $ 787 billion stimulus funds awarded earlier this year , the Murtha airport picked up $ 800,000 .
And , on Thursday , the Senate rejected a measure that would have ended $ 1.4 million in annual subsidies for the airport .
Manager Says Murtha Airport Provides Jobs
On a recent visit to the airport , ABC News found it virtually deserted , with an empty restaurant , vacant lounges and quiet runways .
An air traffic controller was twiddling his thumbs .
Thanks to Murtha , there is a Pennsylvania National Guard training facility located at the airport , but its personnel fly helicopters , not airplanes .
Murtha Airport manager Scott Voekler said the airport provides an important service to the economically devastated Johnstown , Pa. , area .
" It is tremendously important because when you bring companies in , you bring jobs , " Voekler said .
Murtha is the person to thank for the " modern , state - of - the - art airport , " he said .
" All the major construction projects at the airport are directly from Mr. Murtha , " Voekler said .
" He has been a great sponsor of the airport and is trying to bring business in .
...
You have to have infrastructure to bring businesses in . "
Those who use the airport are grateful to have it .
" This is not an airport for nobody , " Johnstown resident Gil Weakland said after arriving on a flight from Washington .
" We have industries here , we have businesses here and we have people who travel out of here .
" John Murtha is a good man , " Weakland added .
" You got to look at earmarks for what they are .
What would communities like this do without a conscientious congressman ? "
We were a busy working family , and I would find it difficult to feed my family in a healthy way – quickly .
So I decided to change our diet , and this happened throughout the course of the campaign , with simple things .
I started adding more fruits and vegetables , trying to sit down and prepare a meal as a family a couple times a week , and eating out a little bit less .
Trying to eliminate processed and sugary foods as much as possible .
And I saw some really immediate results with just those minor changes .
I thought well , if I could help other families learn these small changes in my role as first lady , that would be a good thing .
Flavio Briatore has left his position as boss of the Renault team after they decided not to contest charges of fixing the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix .
Executive director of engineering Pat Symonds has also left the team .
Renault were summoned by governing body , the FIA , after Nelson Piquet Jr claimed he had been asked to crash to help team - mate Fernando Alonso 's race .
An FIA spokesperson confirmed a World Motor Sport Council hearing in Paris on Monday would go ahead .
Renault have been called to answer charges that they " conspired with Nelson Piquet Jr to cause a deliberate crash at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix with the aim of causing the deployment of the safety car to the advantage of its other driver , Fernando Alonso " .
The hearing will attempt to attribute responsibility for the Singapore " crash - gate " despite the departure of Briatore and Symonds .
Briatore has lost his job over the Singapore race - fix charge
The FIA could still impose sanctions if Renault are found guilty , including excluding the team from the championship , although that must be considered unlikely given the two people Piquet said were responsible have now left the team .
When asked for his thoughts on Briatore 's demise , Formula 1 boss Bernie Ecclestone said : " Well , I feel sorry for him actually .
" Obviously , I am surprised at what has happened , and I am taken by surprise today that they 've decided to walk away . "
Piquet crashed in Singapore two laps after Alonso had come in for a routine pit stop .
That meant that when race officials sent out the safety car to clear up the debris from Piquet 's car , Alonso was alone among the front - runners in not having to stop for fuel and tyres .
Renault 's double world champion went on to take the chequered flag at Formula 1's inaugural night race and claim the team 's first victory in two years .
At the time , Piquet attributed the crash to a simple error , but after being dropped by the team after July 's Hungary GP the race - fixing allegations emerged .
The Brazilian has since testified to the FIA that he was instructed by Briatore and Symonds when and where to crash .
Renault 's response was to accuse the 24 - year - old and his father Nelson Piquet of false allegations and blackmail , going as far as saying they would begin legal action against them .
But on Wednesday the team said in a statement they would " not dispute the recent allegations made by the FIA concerning the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix " .
The statement added : " The team also wishes to state that its managing director , Flavio Briatore and its executive director of engineering , Pat Symonds , have left the team . "
BBC pundit and former team boss Eddie Jordan said he was surprised by Renault 's announcement but believes it was effectively an admission of guilt .
ANDREW BENSON'S BLOG F1 has long been notorious for its skewed sense of morality , and it appears that may be what has led to this latest scandal
" Suggesting they are not going to contest the allegations is in itself an admission , " Jordan told the BBC .
" I do n't know what goes on in teams , and certainly in the Jordan team you would contemplate all sorts of things , but you certainly could n't contemplate that . "
It remains to be seen whether this latest controversy , and the exit of Briatore and Symonds , will affect Renault 's decision to stay in Formula 1 .
Briatore had denied speculation that the French team 's future was under threat and the team have signed a new Concorde Agreement to stay in F1 until 2012 .
But this latest controversy , coupled with a decline in cars sales , could yet have repercussions for the staff of around 700 , who are are employed at the team 's headquarters in Enstone , in Oxfordshire , and Viry - Chatillon in Paris .
Former grand prix winner John Watson told the BBC : " The fact that Flavio Briatore and Pat Symonds have left the team was the only solution to Renault .
Symonds was Michael Schumacher 's race engineer in the 1990s " A company on the scale of Renault , a world - scale motor company could not afford to have a scandal of this magnitude rattling around in the boardroom . "
As it is , Renault 's statement appears to end the F1 career of two of the sport 's best - known protagonists .
Briatore became Benetton team principal in 1988 and when Renault bought Benetton in 2000 to run under its own moniker , the 59 - year - old Italian was chosen to lead the team .
Symonds started his F1 career in 1981 at the Toleman team , which morphed into Benetton and Renault , and worked his way though the ranks to become executive director of engineering in 2001 .
Briatore was also heavily involved in the teams ' association Fota , as it sought to reach an agreement on the future of the sport with the FIA this season .

Hero pilot , 70 , averted air show disaster after co-pilot hit throttle of giant bomber by mistake
As the Cold War bomber shot towards the air show crowd , retired RAF pilot Bob Prothero knew he had to act ... and fast .
The 75 - ton Victor was only meant to have slowly taxied down the runway and stop for a photoshoot , but his amateur co-pilot had accidentally slammed on the throttle , sending it 150 ft up into the sky .
Now it was veering , putting it on a collision course with the crowd and a nearby housing estate if they tried to land .
Scroll down for video
[ caption ]
But Mr Prothero , 70 , who last flew a Victor in the 1980s and whose flying licence has long expired , wrestled with the plane 's controls to steer it away from potential disaster .
He landed on one wheel and in a cloud of dust , but without a scratch - on grass at the end of the runway .
Hailed a hero after an inquiry into the near disaster he said it was ' the most terrifying nine seconds of my life ' .
Grandfather Mr Prothero said : ' I was petrified .
There was n't time to think about anything .
Everything was pure instinct on that day .
' It all happened extremely fast .
I was shouting at the co-pilot to pull the throttle back .
Hero : Retired pilot Bob Prothero ( left ) safely landed the plane .
The RAF veteran is also pictured as a Squadron Commander in 1979
For some reason he never did and I saw the nose rise into the air , I thought ' Oh God here we go , how are we going to get out of this one ? '
' So I had to make a snap decision : ' Do I try to land the plane or do I fly round in a circle and land properly ' ?
' I put the nose down and noticed that we were well and truly airborne but because of the crosswind we were not over the runway .
' I thought , ' where are we and what can we do to rescue the situation ' ?
' Thankfully , I managed to pitch the plane back towards the runway and away from any spectators .
' My only concern was getting the plane down as quickly and safely as possible .

' Although I touched down on the grass I still managed to keep it under control .
All that was left to do was get out and kiss the ground .
' Nobody could really believe what had happened .
There were people slapping me on the back and congratulating me on not crashing the thing and ruining the day . '
The drama unfolded at the Cold War Jets day at Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome , near Lutterworth , Leicestershire , on May 3 , where the plane - named Teasin ' Tina - is kept , and was captured on video by an onlooker who posted it on the YouTube internet site .
In the footage the plane is seen swerving to the left after takeoff and veering back to the right before touching down .
One spectator is heard asking : ' Should it be doing that ? '' while others shriek in disbelief .
The aircraft is designed to use a drag parachute as a brake , but Mr Prothero did not have time to deploy it .
[ caption ]
[ caption ]
Instead he managed to reduce the throttle during the emergency landing .
David Walton , managing director of the aerodrome , said : ' It was a brilliant piece of airmanship from Bob .
If the aircraft had stalled the day could so easily have ended in tragedy . '
Mr Prothero , a former RAF Group Captain , of Portsmouth , Hampshire , was part of the two man crew .
His co-pilot was an engineer with no flying experience who worked on the bomber 's upkeep and was drafted in to control the throttle at the air show .
The Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA ) launched an investigation because neither are officially licensed to fly , although it was fine for them to taxi along the runway as had been intended .
In its report , the CAA later blamed the unnamed co-pilot , saying he ' froze ' when ordered to pull off the throttle , but it is not taking legal action .
[ caption ]
Ian Weston , head of enforcement , said : ' The aircraft took off because the engineer did not shut down the engines when told to do so by the pilot .
' The pilot attempted to shut the engines down but the aircraft lifted off .
' The problem arose as a result of the engineer ' freezing ' at a time of high stress .
' This is a recognised state of mind which can affect certain individuals . '
Teasin ' Tina , along with Lusty Lindy , is one of only Victors that remain in working condition .
Following up on the brief detention of Shahrukh Khan , one of India ’s most famous actors , at a US airport , the star of the upcoming “ My Name Is Khan , ” which explores the treatment of people with Muslim surnames in the United States , says that he will never again visit the US .
His detention , which has created something of an international incident and a major headline story in India , stems from his surname allegedly matching one on one of the assorted US watchlists .
Khan says he has never been treated so shabbily , and that the airport officials refused to let him contact anyone for over an hour despite several Indian and Pakistani travelers on the scene vouching for his identity as one of the most famous men on the subcontinent .
His mistreatment may in the long - run be good for him in the US , as it will no doubt draw attention to the American release of his next movie , which is expected sometime next year .
The outcry from the Indian population will no doubt fade over time as well , because Khan ’s detention lasted only a couple of hours .
But ultimately this is n’t about Khan or his movie , or about Newark Airport employees not recognizing an international celebrity who , among the non-Indian population of the US , is lets face it , relatively unknown .
Rather it draws attention to something that is happening to hundreds , perhaps thousands of people on a daily basis across the US .
People get hauled out of line , on the basis of a name , or a nationality , or a religion , and subjected to God - knows - what behind closed doors .
Khan ’s detention was no doubt considerably shortened by the Indian embassy springing into action the moment it discovered one of the nation ’s favorite sons was in custody .
Suppose this did n’t happen to Shahrukh Khan the actor , but Shahrukh Khan the small business owner , or Shahrukh Khan the dentist .
Would we even be talking about it ?
Would he still be in custody ?
We do n’t know the full details of what happened to this fellow yesterday , and maybe we never will .
But his story is common enough that it seems unlikely the airport officials broke any serious rules with what they did .
It ’s business as usual in the US these days , and instead of chastising these people for not treating an international celebrity with due decorum , should n’t we be asking whether or not these rules need a major rethink ?

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A prominent banking analyst said on Sunday that 150 to 200 more U.S. banks will fail in the current banking crisis , and the industry ’s payments to keep the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp afloat could eat up 25 percent of pretax income in 2010 .
Richard Bove of Rochdale Securities said this will likely force the FDIC , which insures deposits , to turn increasingly to non-U.S. banks and private equity funds to shore up the banking system .
“ The difficulty at the moment is finding enough healthy banks to buy the failing banks , ” Bove wrote .
The FDIC is expected on August 26 to vote on relaxed guidelines for private equity firms to invest in failed banks , after critics said previously proposed rules were too harsh and would actually dissuade firms from making investments .
Bove said “ perhaps another 150 to 200 banks will fail , ” on top of 81 so far in 2009 , adding stress to the FDIC ’s deposit insurance fund .
Three large failures this year -- BankUnited Financial Corp in May , and Colonial BancGroup Inc , Guaranty Financial Group Inc in August -- collectively cost the fund roughly $ 10.7 billion .
The fund had $ 13 billion at the end of March .
Regulators closed Guaranty ’s banking unit on Friday and sold assets of the Texas - based lender to Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA .
The FDIC agreed to share in losses with the Spanish bank .
Bove said the FDIC will likely levy special assessments against banks in the fourth quarter of this year and second quarter of 2010 .
He said these assessments could total $ 11 billion in 2010 , on top of the same amount of regular assessments .
“ FDIC premiums could be 25 percent of the industry ’s pretax income , ” he wrote .

Richard Metzger is the current Boing Boing guest blogger .
Watching the news with the G20 protesters in London carrying banners reading " Capitalism Failed Us " and " Marx was Right ! "
I felt quite good about the day 's events .
In 1983 and 1984 , I was living in London and going to protests like this myself and it brought back long - forgotten memories .
When I was younger , I considered myself a staunch socialist , but as I got older that way of identifying myself fell away .
After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the break - up of the Soviet Union , it seemed like Marxism was something that the world had moved on from and so did I .
During the dotcom era , I was as greedy a capitalist as the next guy .
Five years ago , slimming my library down for a cross country move , I unemotionally tossed all of my " Karl Marx and related " books .
Boy do I regret doing this now !
One recent evening , I was writing something and I thought I 'd coined a nifty new phrase to describe a major factor in the economic meltdown : " fictitious capital . "
I decided to Google the term and it's a good thing that I did n't pat myself on the back too hard because it 's something that Karl Marx came up with about 150 years before me .
That Google search led me down a Karl Marx rabbit hole that lasted for weeks ( My wife , Tara , called it " worse than your reggae phase ! " ) .
I bought a new copy of " Capital " and read deep into the night .
I emerged a few days later , bleary - eyed , unshaven and proudly declaring myself a socialist again .
The work of Karl Marx is ultra relevant to understanding the world 's current financial mess , do n't let anyone tell you otherwise .
Marx has become intellectually indispensable to me again , as if there ever should have been any doubt .
It 's fascinating to consider that during the time period when Marx was writing " Capital , " there were few factories in England –it was largely an agrarian society still– yet somehow Marx was able to see clearly the mess that we would be in today .
He 's the most accurate prophet in all of history , there should be no doubt about this .
Marx viewed history with a very , very long telescope .
How he was able to see so far into the future is a mystery of his particular genius , but Marx accurately extrapolated how capitalism 's endgame would play itself out at the very birth of the system .
Marx saw how utterly destructive this system would ultimately become .
Look around you : Marx was right .
If you disagree , well , I have a challenge for you : Start reading Marx 's " Capital " and see what you think afterward .
Keep an open mind and try to get past the drier chapters up front .
It 's a richly rewarding intellectual journey to take .
There is an online course taught by Professor David Harvey that I found quite helpful , you might want to take in some ( or all ) of his lectures for chapters that are more difficult to understand .
Maybe some of you might want to form an online reading group on Facebook .
The important point is to READ Marx again and to rediscover how prescient his ideas really were and how well they explain what 's going on today .

Senior White House officials have made it known that the self - imposed deadline for closing Guantanamo by January , one of the first orders laid down by Barack Obama as president , may have to be extended as legal and logistical questions prevent the U.S. from regaining its “ moral high ground . ” — JCL
The Independent :
The White House acknowledged for the first time that it might not be able to close the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay by January as President Barack Obama promised .
Senior administration officials said difficulties in completing the lengthy review of detainee files and resolving thorny legal and logistical questions mean the president ’s self - imposed January deadline may slip .
Mr Obama remains as committed to closing the facility as he was when , as one of his first acts in office , he pledged to shut it down , said the officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to more freely discuss the sensitive issue .
They said the White House still was hoping to meet the deadline through a stepped - up effort .

CAIRO , June 25 , 2009 ( ANHRI ) —
The Jordanian court issued a ruling sentencing poet Islam Samhan , 27 - years - old , to one year in prison and fining him 10,000 Jordanian Dinars ( 14,000 US ) .
He was accused of ridiculing Islam and not registering his publication at the Jordanian department of printing and publishing .
In March 2008 , Islam published his collection of poems " Rahaqet Dhel , " ( Gracefulness of a Shadow ) .
He faced a campaign led by Muslim Brotherhood and the Jordanian Mufti accusing him of blasphemy because of some verses he wrote .
The campaign resulted in Samhan being prosecuted and detained for 15 days on October 19 , 2008 .
However , Samhan said that he had registered his book in the National Library and submitted copies at the Jordanian department of printing and publishing in early 2009 , and that some ministries and government institutes bought copies of it .
" It is not at all about blasphemy , but because of the poem " When features are that clear , " which described dim - witted intelligence people , who convince Arab rulers that their own people are but a senseless pile of lumber . "
The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( ANHRI ) has condemned the sentence and considers it " an explicit assertion of blasphemy . "
A dimwit Northern Ireland man wore a fluorescent builders ’ bib while attempting to rob houses under the cover of darkness .
Bungling would - be thief Stephen Frederick Hamilton was spotted by neighbours who called the cops as he tried to break into houses in Dunlady Manor in Dundonald .
Hapless Hamilton ’s 4.30 am crime spree came to an end when he was tracked down by officers with the help of a police dog to a nearby supermarket car park .
At Downpatrick Crown last week Judge Peter Gibson labelled Hamilton ’s crimes as “ amateurish in the extreme ” as he gave him a 15 - month jail sentence , suspended for three years .
Gambling addict Hamilton , 24 , from north Belfast had pleaded guilty to six counts of attempted burglary on February 19 .

In July many adult movie studios filed a copyright complaint against 10,000 alleged porn uploaders .
The producers wanted a large number of convictions but were disappointed when prosecutors went after just 10 individuals .
The studios have responded by reporting another 65,000 file - sharers and demanding action .
Two months ago , a collection of fifty US and Japan - based adult movie studios filed a mass copyright complaint against around 10,000 South Koreans accused of being heavy uploaders of porn .
The studios also filed suit against 80 websites accused of aiding and abetting the distribution of the illegally uploaded movies .
A National Police Agency spokesman said that the lawsuit was filed at 10 police stations in the South Korean capital , Seoul , and in the Gyeonggi province .
The studios asked the police to investigate the infringements , which carry a potential jail sentence .
However , from the 10,000 complaints issued , prosecutors charged just 10 people with copyright infringement .
In response , the disappointed studios say they will fight back .
Next week they promise to re-file their lawsuit , but this time will increase the number of individuals accused to 65,000 .
Kim Han -Seo , a lawyer representing the movie producers , said that the prosecutors were not tough enough so they had decided to up the ante .
“ Now , we ’ve drawn up a new list of some 65,000 users who fit this guideline , ” he said .
“ We ’ll see whether the prosecutors will press charges against them all . ”
As we reported earlier on our sister site FreakBits , at the end of August distributors of a hit Korean disaster movie called in the police after it was leaked to the Internet and was downloaded 100,000 times .
Kim Han-Seo said that the Korean authorities had responded quickly to that local problem , but accused them of different standards when it comes to protecting foreign content , such as the material produced by his porn movie employers .
“ We believe that [ the prosecution ] should not be discriminatory in applying copyright laws .
Illegal copying and distribution run rampant in Korea because it is one of the world ’s most wired countries .
We decided to take legal action to minimize our past business losses and to protect anticipated future profits , ” he said .
The threat now is that if the local Korean authorities fails to act in a way that pleases the porn producers , they will take their case directly to the US government instead .
The initial lawsuit indicated that the studios had also harvested the IP addresses of around 100,000 individuals who downloaded the adult movies but to date , there is no indication that they will become a target .
Bicycle Inflation in Paradise ?
Stuart Isett for The New York Times
Portland , Oregon , the current darling of America ’s food and environmental writers , is arguably the county ’s most bicycle - obsessed city .
Bike use was up 28 percent in Portland between 2007 and 2008 , and on the Hawthorne Bridge , a main thoroughfare , bikes now make up 20 percent of all vehicles .
The New York Times estimated in 2007 that there were 125 bike - related businesses in Portland employing 600 to 800 people .
There ’s even a store in the city that sells only tricycles .
When I arrived in Portland last month , the first thing I wanted to do was buy a bike and get around the way the locals do .
Since I would n’t be in town for too long , and it was n’t clear that I ’d be able to take the bike with me when I left , I wanted something extremely cheap .
There were bike shops on every other corner in Southeast Portland , the sort of Brooklyn - ish neighborhood where I was staying .
I walked into what looked like the grungiest of them — a store that sold mostly used bikes .
There was one employee , and he was heavily tattooed and seemed pretty cool .
I completely leveled with him : I did n’t know anything about bikes , really ; I could barely change a tire ; I was only going to be in town for a little while ; and I wondered if he had something cheap that I could use for puttering around town .
I know this is sort of quaint , but the last time I bought a bike , I think I spent $ 35 and it was n’t hot .
It was a road bike ; it had 18 speeds , I think ; it squeaked ; and it served my needs ( biking from my house to school every day ) perfectly well .
( The bike later died a peaceful death at Burning Man , but that was due to maltreatment , not poor quality . )
I was looking for something like that .
The guy in the store asked me how much I wanted to spend .
I sort of stuttered my way and ultimately refused to answer the question because I was embarrassed to say something like “ less than a hundred dollars , ” for fear of coming off like Borat inspecting the Hummer before buying the ice - cream truck .
Yeah , the bike guy answered , he had something super - cheap for me , an old road bike that they ’d fixed up .
It was n’t exactly my size , but it would do .
It was a 1991 model , a Trek , I think .
It was in good working condition , it had some newer components , and it came with a warranty .
I could have it , he said , for $ 475 .
So I went to another store .
Same deal , more or less .
There was one bike for $ 275 , but it was a girl ’s Raleigh from the 1960 ’s with a wicker basket .
I started looking around the web .
At the down - to - earth - sounding Recyclery , another Portland used bike shop — and probably a great one — there are currently 59 used bikes on offer .
But 34 of them cost more than $ 1,000 , only eight are priced under $ 500 , and there are none under $ 300 .
Even to rent a bike for one week from the Recyclery costs $ 175 — more than I paid for my weekly rental car the previous time I was in Portland .
At Portland ’s Costco , meanwhile — on the outskirts of the city — you can buy a brand - new Schwinn Midtown city bike with Shimano shifters for around $ 200 .
But , according to the clerk there , those Schwinns are n’t moving .
I do n’t doubt that the Schwinn Midtown is a far inferior bike , from the point of view of a bike connoisseur , to whatever is being sold used in Portland .
But you ’ve got to love a city whose citizens put a set of moral / aesthetic principles — whether it ’s riding a bike with proper disc brakes or refusing to support the Big Box stores — this far above their own financial well - being .
And although every city has its bike aficionados , I think that in Portland , most people just buy rebuilt bikes locally because it feels right to do so , not because all these everyday bike riders can really tell the difference between Shimano TX - 30 derailleurs and M - 970 XTR’s .
Still , what ’s up with this bike micro-inflation ?
Why does there seem to be no market in Portland for used bikes that are actually cheap ?
Portland is otherwise a pretty cheap city .
Beer is cheap .
Used clothing is cheap .
By major urban standards , housing is cheap too , unless you compare it to the strip - mall - type cities .
And certainly there are plenty of people in town who ca n’t afford to spend $ 475 — never mind $ 1,000 — on a bike .
I asked a few people in town about this and got some general sense of agreement and common frustration : cheap bikes are impossible to find around here .
The word on the street was that so many people are selling their cars ( or taking their cars off the road ) and using bikes to commute to work that there just are n’t enough bikes to go around .
I also heard about a guy who was actually in the business of bicycle arbitrage ; he would immediately snap up the few cheap bikes that would come up on Craigslist , fix them up a bit , put them back up on Craigslist , and make a good profit .
So I started looking at Craigslist — not just in Portland , but in other cities too , and not just at bike prices , but also at car and truck prices .
I looked at a wide range of midsized - to - large cities that I thought represented a diversity of urban layouts , bike prevalence , wealth , and so on : Austin , Miami , New York City , Phoenix , Portland , San Francisco , and Seattle .
From each of these cities I collected an extremely basic data set : the asking prices for the 50 most recent cars , trucks , and bikes advertised .
I excluded children ’s bikes , frame - only bikes , and non-working bikes ; I excluded non-working cars and cars that were being sold for parts .
I also excluded obvious dealer spam from each .
Then I looked at the medians .
Here ’s what happened :
I did n’t run any serious statistical tests on the data set .
This is because there are a few fundamental problems , the largest being that we ’re not comparing apples to apples in terms of what ’s being sold .
That is , we do n’t know if the same types of bikes are being sold for more in Seattle than in Phoenix , or if there are different types of bikes being sold in the two markets .
The ads also change so frequently that replicating these results might be difficult ; and 50 data points might be too small a sample .
Still , whether it ’s over / underpricing or just selective selling , what struck me about this informal little analysis was that not one city fell out of line in the inverse order .
Where cars were selling for the most , bikes were selling for the least ; where cars were selling for the least , bikes were selling for the most ; and so on , inversely , in between .
So , it looks like even though there are tons of bikes and bike shops in Portland , there still are n’t enough sellers in town to satisfy the strong demand in this bikers ’ paradise .
Perhaps in the long run , when enough arbitrageurs start shuffling bikes around the country ( and enough arbitrageurs start underpricing each other to drive down their margins ) , more cheap used bikes will become available in the bike - friendly cities .
In the meantime , if you ’re a Portland or Seattle resident thinking of selling your car and going green , maybe you should drive down to Phoenix and ride a bike back .
You ’d leverage both sides of the inverse relationship — plus there ’d be some beautiful scenery along the way .
.- Father Jose Gabriel Funes , director of the Vatican Observatory , said this week there is no opposition between belief in the existence of aliens and at the same time belief in God .
This position , he reminded , was held by Father Angelo Secchi , the 18th century Jesuit astronomer and director of the Observatory of the Roman College — today the Pontifical Gregorian University .
In an interview with L’Osservatore Romano , Father Funes explained that Father Secchi was the first scientist to classify the “ stars according to their spectrum ” and that the existence of aliens “ could not be excluded a priori . ”
Father Funes said establishing contact with aliens is “ very difficult ” because of the “ almost insurmountable obstacle of distances in the universe , ” even with today ’s technology .
He went on to note that the neither Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith or academic officials at other institutions has made any statements on the issue , adding that “ as a scientist I am always willing to update my ideas in response to the latest research .
For example , regarding the issue of space and time in the universe , I believe it is finite , while others believe it is infinite . ”
“ There are interesting theories about this , ” he continued , “ such as the so - called ‘ multiverse , ’ but they continue to be merely speculative : the problem is in how to prove them . ”
Father Funes said astronomy is an element that can contribute to dialogue between peoples , as it can help to understand that “ all the people of the earth are under the same sky and gaze upon the same heavens . ”
“ It is obvious that today you cannot do research without collaboration .
One country on its own cannot build a huge telescope : it is necessary to work with other people , and with other religions and cultures as well .
Thus astronomy can be at the service of dialogue , ” the Argentinean priest said .
He went on to stress that an astronomer must always have “ his feet planted firmly on the ground and that “ scientific research demands a culture of effort and work .
In this way it can be useful for young people as well . ”
Father Funes said it is widely believed today that “ in order to be a scientist one must necessarily be atheist .
This is not true , ” he corrected .
“ The Pope said it well during the Mass of the Epiphany when he pointed out that ‘ many scientists — following in Galileo 's footsteps renounce neither reason nor faith ; instead they develop both in their reciprocal fruitfulness . ’ ”
“ I chose to be an astronomer because I believe that in the universe it is possible to encounter God .
And I continue to be one with the same conviction , ” he said .
Father Funes also announced that in order to mark the International Year of Astronomy , an expo on telescopes will take place October 15 at the Vatican Museums .
In addition , the Pontifical Academy for Sciences will host a November 6 - 11 Congress on Astrobiology that will look at the search for life in the universe .
Al Franken 's Senate career just keeps on getting better : this week he read the Fourth Amendment ( " no Warrants shall issue but upon probable cause , supported by Oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized . " ) aloud to a high - ranking Department of Justice official who was making the case for renewing the PATRIOT
Act 's provision for roving wiretaps .
" That 's pretty explicit language , " noted Franken , asking Kris how the " roving wiretap " provision of the Patriot Act can meet that requirement if it does n't require the government to name its target .
Kris looked flustered and mumbled that " this is surreal , " apparently referring to having to respond to Franken 's question .
" I would defer to the other branch of government , " he said , referring to the courts , prompting Franken to interject : " I know what that is . "
Kris explained that the courts have held that the law 's requirements that the person be described , though not named , is sufficient to meet the demands of the Constitution .
That did not appear to completely satisfy Franken 's concerns .

A big YouTube hit makes startling predictions about the Islamification of Europe over the next few decades and has been viewed more than 10 million times .
But can you believe what it says ?
This seven - and - a- half minute video " Muslim Demographics " uses slick graphics , punctuated with dramatic music , to make some surprising claims , asserting that much of Europe will be majority Muslim in just a few decades .
It says that in the past two decades , 90 % of all population growth in Europe has been Muslim immigration .
FIND OUT MORE ...
More or Less is on BBC Radio 4 on Fridays at 1330 BST Listen to the programme here In France , it says 30 % of those aged 20 and younger are Muslim , with the birth rate for Muslim families massively exceeding that across all families .
It says France will be an Islamic Republic within 39 years .
In the UK it says the Muslim population has risen 30 - fold since the beginning of the 1980s .
But are any of the video 's statistics true ?
Of the video 's claims that 90 % of Europe 's population growth since 1990 is due Islamic immigration , only a fragment is true .
Immigration is the main driver of population growth according to EU statistics and in some exceptional years , 90 % of population growth has been down to net inward migration .
But that includes all immigrants coming into the EU , not just Muslims .
It is the claims made about individual countries that are most striking .
The video says that a typical French family has 1.8 children but that French Muslim families have 8.1 children .
MUSLIM DEMOGRAPHICS VIDEO
Watched 10 million times Authorship unknown Posted by inactive account ' friendofmuslim '
How we check the figures
No source is given for this information and the French government does n't collect statistics by religion .
So it is impossible to say what the precise fertility rates among different religious groups in France are .
But no country on earth has such a high fertility rate and in Algeria and Morocco , the two nations which send the largest numbers of Muslim immigrants to France , the fertility rate is 2.38 , according to the UN 's 2008 figures .
In the Netherlands , according to the video , half of all newborns are Muslim , and in 15 years half the population will be Muslim .
But the Dutch office of statistics estimates that Muslims make up only 5 % of the population .
For Dutch Muslim women to produce half the nation 's babies , they would have to be giving birth at at least 14 times the rate of their non-Muslim neighbours .
The Muslim population of Europe has risen , but not as fast as alleged Is 25 % of the Belgian population Muslim , as the video asserts ?
No .
The Belgian office of statistics points to a 2008 study which suggests the real figure is just 6 % .
The video also states that the Muslim population of the UK has grown 30 - fold in the past 30 years .
They get the figure by estimating that the British Muslim population has risen from 82,000 to 2.5 million .
The firm data is in the 2001 census , which counted close to 1.6 million Muslims in England and Wales .
That number will have risen since 2001 so 2.5 million is not impossible .
The 2011 census will be looked to for clarification .
However , according to Dr Andrew Hinde , a demographer at Southampton University , the 82,000 figure is a gross under-estimate .
" If you take the 1981 census there was no question asked on religious belief , " he says , " but if you take those born in Pakistan and Bangladesh as a minimum estimate of the number of Muslims in 1981 , it 's about 300,000 . "
That would mean the growth rate has been significantly slower than the video suggests .
But the video does n't just rely on statistics , it also uses an official Government statement .
It quotes it as saying : " The fall in German population can no longer be stopped .
Its downward spiral is no longer reversible .
It will be a Muslim state by the year 2050 . "
The statement in question was made by then vice - president of the Federal Statistics Office , Walter Radermacher , who is now chief statistician of the European Union .
He says that while it is true he said Germany 's population was in decline , the last part of the quote [ in italics ] is just an invention .
He said nothing about Germany becoming a Muslim state .
" The quotation which reads as if the German government believed that Germany will become a Muslim state is simply not true , " he says .
" There is no source which can be quoted that the German government has published such an expression or opinion . "
Inexact science
The video also claims the German government believes the number of Muslims in Europe will double to 104 million .
Mr Radermacher adds : " That is not true .
The German government does not believe that the Muslim population will double in the next 40 or 50 years .
There are no reliable sources that give a proof for that assumption . "
Population projection is an inexact science .
No - one knows how many Muslims will be living in Europe or anywhere else by 2050 .
The current trends suggest that by 2050 Europe will have a bigger proportion of Muslims , although nothing like the level suggested in the video .
But the big assumption here is current trends .
Levels of immigration and fertility change over time .
It is certainly true that immigrant communities often have higher fertility rates but over time these usually fall into line with the indigenous population .
This might not happen with Muslim immigrants .
But nobody can know and that 's why , according to Dr Hinde , it is so hard to guess the future .
" In the 1930s there were population projections made of the UK that by the end of the century the UK population would be 20 million .
Well , it turned out to be 50 million .
" That 's how far out you can get when you 're moving 40 or 50 years down the line and not taking into account the uncertainty . "
More or Less is produced in association with the Open University .
A selection of your comments appears below .
While the numbers in the video and the clarifications are a welcome step - I am afraid you have missed the most crucial number of them all :
The fact that this video has been watched over 10 million times if proof enough that there is an element of Islamophobia ( or a variant of this phobia ) which is present in Europe ( assuming that the majority of the viewers of the video hail from Europe ) .
What remains to be assessed is whether this " group " and the Islamic population can mutually and peacefully co-exist .
If yes good , if not - then Europe is headed for a very fractious future .
Aadhaar Verma , Mysore , India I have several times registered my objection to this You Tube video , each time giving reasons .
I am closely connected to demographic statistics through my work , and was able to quote some of the facts you include , such as that France does not collect statistics by religion and that immigrant communities often have higher fertility rates on arrival but that these fall quite quickly .
As a Jew , I am reminded strongly of some of the anti-Semitic propaganda which was rife at the time when my grandparents arrived in Britain at the turn of the 19/20th century .
You may also be interested to know that Snopes debunks this video clip as well .
However it has so far proved impossible to get You Tube to remove this hateful ( in both senses ) item .
Carole Abrahams , London I 've been travelling to Greece for the last three decades and I have noticed that the immigrant population ( legal and illegal ) has exploded .
Most of them are Muslims .
I think it is very logical for Europeans to have open discussions on this topic because it will change the face of Europe forever .
John L , Toronto , Ontario
It is interesting to note how such " facts " quoted on the internet are so readily , and unquestioningly accepted !
Mike Morgan , Praha , Czech Republic
Even if the base statistics were correct ( which they are not ) , and the population projection methods were sensible ( which they are not ) , the suggestion that a country would become an " Islamic Republic " just because the majority of its citizens were Muslims should show people the ( not very well ) hidden agenda that the posters of this video have .
Muslims , like Christians , are diverse and many would no more want to live in an Islamic Republic that I , as a Christian , would want to live in a Puritan State .
Chris Lewis , Istanbul , Turkey
This highlights the fact that no - one knows what the relative rates of increase of population is in both the Muslim section of the population and the non-Muslim one .
That in itself is cause for alarm .
The whole culture of the UK has changed dramatically within the last 3 or 4 decades , whether through the influence of the US culture or that of the immigration from South Asia .
Ought this to go unchecked ?
Edward Johns , Lannion , France I 've watched the video .
It 's not the most accurate in its claims , but it does raise a very valid point .
Your article sets out to point out flaws in the video , but it would be more enlightening if it addressed the issue raised .
Having read the article , I 'm still none the wiser as far as what is really happening and what it means for the future of Europe and the world .
And in that regard , I 'd say your article has failed to ' debunk ' fears provoked by the video .
If anything , the article 's weakness has reinforced my fears .
Malcolm McLaren , Houston , USA A scare - mongering video , likely originating in far - right circles - it goes to show , do n't believe anything on the Internet without independent verification .
Do your research before you fall for something like this video !
The Internet is not trustworthy ; it was never conceived to be either trustworthy or untrustworthy , it was conceived as a means of communication and transferring information .
So : Do n't blame the Internet , but do n't trust it either .
D Fear , Heidelberg , Germany I can't stand this kind of inflammatory material , I was once forwarded an email that claimed the holocaust was to be cut out of the British school curriculum to avoid offending holocaust deniers ( specifically Iranians apparently ) .
It simply was n't true - but a lot of my colleagues believed it on face value .

I think this is a wonderful article to debunk that video .
I am a Muslim and I think that video has been posted not by a " friendofmuslim " but a " enemyofmuslim " to create or increase the Islamophobia that is already in place in some parts of the European continent .

BOSTON , Massachusetts , USA -- Monday , August 3rd , 2009 -- The Free Software Foundation 's DefectiveByDesign.org campaign , in cooperation with prominent authors , journalists , and librarians , has launched a petition against the Amazon Kindle 's use of digital restrictions management ( DRM ) .
" The freedom to read without supervision or interference is central to a free society , " said FSF executive director Peter Brown .
" When ebook products like the Kindle use DRM to restrict what users can do with their books , that is a clear threat to the free exchange of ideas . "
Signatories to the petition include prominent academic and industry names like Creative Commons and Change Congress co-founder Lawrence Lessig ; author , poet and MacArthur Fellow Lewis Hyde ; Harvard Law Professor and Vice Dean for Library and Information Resources John Palfrey ; and Christopher Hayes , Washington , DC editor for The Nation .
The petition , published at http://defectivebydesign.org/amazon1984, is now open for others to add their signatures as well .
" The level of control Amazon has over their ebooks conflicts with basic freedoms that we take for granted , " said Palfrey .
" In a future where books are sold with digital restrictions , it will be impossible for libraries to guarantee free access to human knowledge . "
On the heels of disabling the text - to - speech feature on many ebooks , Amazon drew even further wide - ranging criticism for the remote deletion of Ayn Rand novels and two George Orwell books ( Animal Farm and 1984 ) from the devices of hundreds of users .
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos apologized for the deletions , saying that Amazon would handle such situations differently in the future .
But so far no substantive changes have been made .
" Amazon should never have had this power to begin with , and imposing it broke promises they had previously made .
The only dependable way to preserve people 's rights to free thinking and free expression is for Amazon to remove their DRM , " said FSF operations manager John Sullivan .
Additional comments from signers
" This incident shows that the law gives radically more control to the company than it ought to . "
-- Lawrence Lessig , author and Harvard Law professor
" Any time someone puts a lock on something you own without your permission , they 're not acting in your interests . "
-- Cory Doctorow , author and blogger
" Our future needs Orwell 's books , but it does not need Orwell 's predictions . "
-- Evan Katsamakas , assistant professor in the School of Business at Fordham University
" You should n't need a license to read . "
-- Lewis Hyde , author , poet and MacArthur Fellow

A mammoth forest fire that killed two firefighters and has burned more than 147,000 acres was an act of arson , authorities said Thursday as they launched a homicide investigation into the deaths .
Officials said they determined that the largest brush fire in the history of Los Angeles County was the result of arson after investigators examined forensic evidence from scorched landscape off Angeles Crest Highway , north of La Canada Flintridge .
The spot is believed to be the source of origin of the Station fire .
A source close to the investigation said investigators found incendiary material near the site .
The source , who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to discuss the matter , would not be more specific or identify the material .
Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca said investigators do n’t want to release details out of fear it could hurt their ability to find and prosecute an arsonist .

Baca stressed that the homicide probe is still wide open , saying investigators believe the fire was set deliberately by someone intent on triggering a devastating blaze but that there is a possibility it could have been sparked accidentally by a negligent person .
Either way , the sheriff said the department could pursue homicide charges .
“ If an arsonist did this , everyone should be angry about it , ” Baca told The Times .
“ This is one of the most unacceptable crimes . ”
On Wednesday , authorities cordoned off an area near Mile Marker 29 along Angeles Crest Highway with yellow tape , blocking the highway as investigators searched through the ash under a scorched oak tree using wire mesh sifters .
Even Caltrans workers were turned away .
The probe has been complicated somewhat by the fact that fire burned over the point of origin twice , making the collection of evidence difficult , other sources familiar with the investigation told The Times .

The arson announcement came as firefighters made more progress Thursday in containing the fire .
As of 5 p.m . Thursday , the Station fire had burned at least 147,418 acres and was about 38 % contained .
Firefighters expected to have further information on containment after conducting infrared mapping .
Station fire incident Cmdr. Mike Dietrich said that a thick layer of smoke enveloped much of the area around the southeastern edge of the fire , limiting the use of fixed - wing aircraft and helicopters for water and fire retardant drops on the flames .
Most of the fire ’s growth Thursday took shape on its eastern flank , Dietrich said , where firefighters battling the blaze faced treacherous conditions , including steep terrain and rolling rocks .

Six members of a New Mexico hot shot crew were hospitalized Thursday afternoon , two with moderate injuries and four more with minor injuries , after what was deemed a hazmat incident at the fire ’s northeastern edge .
On the western edge of the fire , crews managed to cut a series of breaks to further protect the area around Pacoima Canyon , and Dietrich said that they have between a mile and a mile and a half more line to cut there .
Meanwhile , it appeared that both Mt. Wilson and the nearby Stony Ridge Observatory had escaped the worst .
Fire lines around Mt. Wilson , home to a historic observatory and communications towers , appeared to be holding , Dietrich said .
“ Crews have made excellent progress the last couple days and we ’re beginning to reap those benefits . ”

Still , forest officials were guarded in their optimism .
In advance of the Labor Day weekend , they took the additional precaution of temporarily closing a huge southern chunk of the Angeles National Forest , stretching from the Grapevine to the 15 Freeway .
Under the order , which went into effect at noon Thursday , anyone violating the closure could be fined or jailed .
Baca said that the fire had wreaked havoc on the lives of so many in Southern California .
“ I am angry , ” he said .
“ Everyone should be angry .
There is an appropriate level of anger here .
This fire destroyed half of one of the best natural resources , the Angeles National Forest .
It sent thousands from their homes . . . and above all else cost the lives of two heroic firefighters . ”

Chicago Northwest Side Voters Sound Off Over McAuliffe - Marwig Race , Presidential Election Illinois ’ hotly contested and expensive race between incumbent state Rep. Michael McAuliffe ( R - Chicago ) and Democrat Merry Marwig is largely considered to be a proxy battle waged by GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan .
That ’s how several voters on Chicago ’s far Northwest Side characterized the 20th House district race after casting ballots today .
“ I think there ’s a real clear divide in the state between folks that support Rauner and , sadly , folks that support Madigan .
I ’m not a Madigan supporter , but I abhor what Rauner is doing , holding the state hostage ” over his “ turnaround agenda , ” said Frank Schulz , 58 .

“ How can the site of the most famous skating rink in the world be considered sinister ?
You know the one that ’s in all romantic comedies … the best first date activity ever !?
And what about that huge Christmas tree that we see in ALL holiday movies ?
That ’s not sinister , that ’s magical ! ” .
If that ’s what you ’re thinking right now , you should probably press pause on your You ’ve Got Mail Deluxe Edition DVD and read on .
If you ’re not surprised that a center called “ Rockefeller ” contains tons of occult and even Luciferian symbolism , as well as references to a New World Order , then you should also read on because I will reinforce what you ’re already thinking , and everybody likes that .
This complex of 19 commercial buildings is situated between Fifth and Seventh avenues in New York City and is famous for its Art Deco style .
It is one of the last building projects in the United States to have incorporated a program of public art .
The submissions chosen all fit a particular philosophy and some artists have been asked to change their work so it fits the theme of the Rockefeller Center which is : Luciferianism .
Luciferianism
The Devil — Lucifer — is a force for good ( where I define ‘ good ’ simply as that which I value , not wanting to imply any universal validity or necessity to the orientation ) .
‘ Lucifer ’ means ‘ light - bringer ’ and this should begin to clue us in to his symbolic importance .
The story is that God threw Lucifer out of Heaven because Lucifer had started to question God and was spreading dissension among the angels .
We must remember that this story is told from the point of view of the Godists ( if I may coin a term ) and not from that of the Luciferians ( I will use this term to distinguish us from the official Satanists with whom I have fundamental differences ) .
The truth may just as easily be that Lucifer resigned from heaven .
- Max More
Modern Luciferianism takes its roots from Gnostic teachings as well as ancient Egyptian and Babylonian paganism .
God of the material world is seen as a stubborn and sadistic figure who seeks to keep mankind into perpetual darkness while Lucifer is the savior of humanity by giving it the gift of knowledge .
If we reinterpret the Adam and Eve story through Luciferian glasses , the serpent is actually the “ undercover savior ” who defied God and gave humans the opportunity to become gods themselves .
He is credited to have unleashed man ’s awesome potential .
“ Luciferianism represents a radical revaluation of humanity ’s ageless adversary : Satan .
It is the ultimate inversion of good and evil .
The formula for this inversion is reflected by the narrative paradigm of the Gnostic Hypostasis myth .
As opposed to the original Biblical version , the Gnostic account represents a “ revaluation of the Hebraic story of the first man ’s temptation , the desire of mere men to ‘ be as gods ’ by partaking of the tree of the ‘ knowledge of good and evil ' ”
- Raschke 26
Luciferians seek during their lifetime to reach a higher level of being by obtaining illumination ( often represented by a torch ) .
An illuminated person or ( Illuminatus ) has gained enough mystic knowledge and spiritual attainment to reach a god - like status .
Ancient Mystery religion promises the :
“ opportunity to erase the curse of mortality by direct encounter with the patron deity , or in many instances by actually undergoing an apotheosis , a transfiguration of human into divine “ .
- Raschke 26
Luciferians do not necessarily worship “ the Devil ” as a metaphysical entity .
Lucifer symbolizes the cognitive powers of man , its potential to reach godliness by its own means .
Luciferians believe that those attributes will eventually dethrone God and bring humans to their rightful place , as deities .
This doctrine is fully embodied by humanism and its technological counterpart transhumanism .
Clothed in an acceptable phrasing inside a Judeo - Christian context ( “ humanist ” sounds less threatening and evil than “ Luciferian ” ) , these philosophies are now part of popular culture .
Through technological advancements and scientific breakthroughs , extremely wealthy figures like Ray Kurzweil are publicly seeking to reach technological immortality .
Transhumanist intellectual Max More has stated in his essay :
God , being the well - documented sadist that he is , no doubt wanted to keep Lucifer around so that he could punish him and try to get him back under his ( God ’s ) power .
Probably what really happened was that Lucifer came to hate God ’s kingdom , his sadism , his demand for slavish conformity and obedience , his psychotic rage at any display of independent thinking and behavior .
Lucifer realized that he could never fully think for himself and could certainly not act on his independent thinking so long as he was under God ’s control .
Therefore he left Heaven , that terrible spiritual - State ruled by the cosmic sadist Jehovah , and was accompanied by some of the angels who had had enough courage to question God ’s authority and his value - perspective .
Lucifer is the embodiment of reason , of intelligence , of critical thought .
He stands against the dogma of God and all other dogmas .
He stands for the exploration of new ideas and new perspectives in the pursuit of truth .
- Max More
So , what does all of this have to do with the Rockefeller Center ?
The sculptures , the bas-reliefs , and the murals all refer to the same theme : the triumph of Man over God through the acquisition of knowledge .
Prometheus Fountain
This statue depicts Prometheus , a Titan of Greek mythology known for his great intelligence .
He has however betrayed the god Zeus by stealing fire and giving it to mankind .
He is , therefore , credited to have taught mankind the arts of civilization such as writing , mathematics , agriculture , medicine , and science .
Zeus then punished Prometheus for his crime by having him bound to a rock while a great eagle ate his liver every day only to have it grow back to be eaten again the next day .
Prometheus [ the name means Forethought ] was a not a fool , but why else would he rebel against Zeus ?
He tried to trick Zeus ( who knows all and sees all ) with a false sacrifice .
How foolish can you get ?
Prometheus also stole fire from Zeus and gave it to the primitive mortals on the earth .
Zeus did not punish Prometheus alone , he punished the entire world for the effrontery of this rebel god .
- Stewart
The Judeo - Christian equivalent of this myth is Lucifer , who has brought the gift of consciousness to humanity , as the serpent in Adam and Eve .
Prometheus Lucifer Blessed with great intelligence Blessed with great intelligence Saw great potential in mankind Saw great potential in Adam and Eve Defied Zeus ’ authority Defied God ’s authority Called the “ Fire Bringer ” Called the “ Light Bringer ” Severly punished by Zeus ( tied up and had liver eaten by eagle daily )
Severly punished by God ( expelled from the Heavens ) Humanity suffered the wrath of Zeus Humanity suffered the wrath of God
Prometheus is the Hellenic equivalent of the Judeo - Christian Lucifer and is often used as the symbol of enlightenment .
Some classically - educated Free Masons and those inspired by their work used “ luciferian ” in the scholarly sense of “ bringing enlightenment ” , invoking Prometheus who stole fire from the gods to bring to man .
Polemicists linked such Masonic usage with sects worshiping Lucifer , which have had persistent groups of followers since the Middle Ages .
– Wikipedia
Paul Manship ’s sculpture featured in the Sunken Plaza of the Rockefeller Center portrays Prometheus holding the fire stolen from Zeus and gliding towards humanity .
He lies inside a ring in which are outlined the signs of the Zodiac .
Behind the statue is an inscription saying :
“ Prometheus , teacher in every art , brought the fire that hath proved to mortals a means to mighty ends . ”
“ Mighty ends ” means reaching enlightenment and achieving godliness .
This artwork basically sums up the Luciferian doctrine and acts as the central figure around which the Rockefeller Center ’s art program revolves around .
Prometheus ’ Creations
Flanking the statue of Prometheus are Youth and Maiden .
These are the first humans created by Prometheus out of clay .
This is the setting : Prometheus ( aka the Hellenic Lucifer ) is located at the center of the Sunken Plaza and is flanked by his creation , mankind .
In other words , we are Prometheus ’ sons and daughters .
Urizen or the Demiurge
On top of the entrance of the GE Building is this impressive Art Deco frieze .
It depicts a bearded man holding a huge compass and a quote from the Book of Isaiah .
This is a direct reference to William Blake ’s “ Urizen ” engravement , where God is a bearded man holding a compass .
This image is featured in Blake ’s “ Book of Urizen ” , released in 1794 .
This English author is known for his rich mythology , cryptic poems , and prophetic imagery .
This particular piece represents Urizen , the god of the material world .
His traits are almost identical to the Gnostic god called “ demiurge ” , an inferior creator deity , who built a flawed world that imprisons man into the material realm .
The Book of Urizen reflects the basic tenets of Luciferianism , where the Good versus Evil struggle as described and Judeo - Christian philosophies are inverted .
“ Blake ’s work is thus an unprecedented and confounding critique of the very cornerstones of Judeo - Christian civilization : the Word and the Law .
Evil is traditionally represented as a turning away from the one or the other – from Satan ’s non servatim to the eating of the “ forbidden fruit ” , but here the Word and the Law are literally presented as manacles closing away the boundless possibility of the universe to the dull prison of the senses and the holy books .
Science and religion cease to be opposing forces in Blake ’s understanding , instead becoming obstacles to true knowledge – one by binding sight in the laws of the material universe , the other by binding thought in the words of the holy books .
In this sense , the only possible “ Good ” as far as Blake is concerned , is the rebellion of sight – growing to see multiple possibilities through ecstatic vision .
For Blake this probably meant mystical and artistic gnosis , but intellectually it can be applied to all kinds of pluralist , multilateral thinking , if not to literal “ mind- expansion ” .
- Daniil Leiderman
The Gnostic god featured at the entrance of GE building holds a huge compass which is used as a tool of creation .
We find here a not - so - subtle reference to Freemasonry , where the compass is used by the “ Great Architect ” to shape the physical world .
Under Urizen we find the quote from the Book of Isaiah :
“ Wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times “ .
– Book of Isaiah 33:6
The book of Isaiah as a whole contains prophecies of future times , predicting the fall and punishment of Babylon ( both ancient and future “ Babylon the Great ” ) .
The quoted verse describes what will sustain people in these prophesied times of great tribulations : knowledge and wisdom .
Isaiah ’s cryptic text describes a time where “ nobody in Jerusalem shall be ill ” , seemingly referring to times where science and technology would be advanced enough to cure man ’s sickness .
In this context , the “ great tribulations ” refer to the coming of a New World Order , where all countries would be united under a single world government , an admitted goal of the Rockefeller family .
Swords into Plowshares
This relief refers to Isaiah 2:4 and depicts swords turning into plowshares .
Here is the biblical verse :
He will judge between the nations
and will settle disputes for many peoples .
They will beat their swords into plowshares
and their spears into pruning hooks .
Nation will not take up sword against nation ,
nor will they train for war anymore .
- Isaiah 2:4
Again , this is a subtle yet very direct allusion to a New World order .
The verse describes a whole with one court for all nations , one government for all nations and the coming of an era of world peace .
The image of swords being beaten into plowshares is also prominently shown on one of the New World Order murals of the Denver International Aiport .
Members of the Rockefeller family have always been actors working towards a one - world government and it is not surprising to find references to this plan etched on their buildings .
David Rockefeller stated in his memoirs
“ For more than century , ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well - publicized incidents to attack the Rockefeller family from the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions .
Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States , characterizing my family and me as “ internationalists ” and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure – one world if you will .
It that ’s the charge , I stand guilty , and I am proud of it ” .
- Memoirs , David Rockefeller p.405
Question is :
Were they already aware of a plan for a New World Order in the 1930 ’s when the Plaza was built ?
Answer :
Yes , yes they were .
The idea is n’t new at all .
Atlas
Guess why Atlas has been forced to carry the celestial world on his shoulders ?
Because he defied Zeus the god .
The north - south axis of the armillary sphere on his shoulders points to the North Star as viewed from New York City .
Laid across Atlas ’s shoulders is a wide , curved beam that displays a frieze of the traditional symbols for Mercury , Venus , Earth , Mars , Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , and Neptune .
Adjacent to Earth ( over Atlas ’s right forearm ) is a small crescent symbolizing the Moon .
Affixed to one of the sphere ’s rings are symbols for twelve constellations through which the Sun passes during the year .
This sculpture can be described as a Luciferian equivalent of Christ nailed to the cross .
Atlas is sacrificing himself for his act of defiance against the gods .
The sculpture has caused its fair share of controversy .
First , the nude and pagan statue was placed right in front of St. Patrick ’s Church , which was n’t well accepted at the times .
Second , from behind , the statue looks like the crucified Jesus Christ .
Finally , Lee Lawrie has been accused of modeling Atlas face after Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini , who was in power at the time .
The same way Atlas defied Zeus in Mythology , the sculpture defies Christianity and even democracy in New York City .
Other Stuff
The Rockefeller Center is full of impressive bas - reliefs , murals , and sculptures , with plenty of symbolism and imagery .
If you go visit the place , you will probably see many other details I ’ve missed ( feel free to send them to me ) .
It is impossible to review in depth everything on display but I will leave you with some interesting pieces you can investigate yourself .
Notice the Babylonian / Egyptian influence , the omnipresence of the torch of illumination and the occult symbols scattered throughout the site .
A mural representing thought as a godly figure sending its gift to man and the fate of the ignorant :
Columbia holding a cup of Divine knowledge :
These spiders have appeared on numerous sites across the world .
They supposedly represent motherhood .
I think they represent the dark forces preying over the masses .
Take your pick .
In Conclusion
The collection of artworks on display at the Rockefeller Center communicate a cohesive message that can be deciphered by analyzing the cultural and mystical references behind the symbols .
The art program as a whole applauds emancipation from the inferior god celebrates the mythological figures who have been against God ’s rule and glorifies Man ’s quest to achieve godliness .
Mankind ’s progress in arts and science considered to have been achieved DESPITE God , making the Rockefeller Center a virtual temple of worship for the Luciferian doctrine .
Luciferianism constitutes the nucleus of the ruling class religion .
It accounts for the longevity of many of the oligarch ’s plans , i.e. the New World Order .
This plan has been discussed for centuries now ( documents prove it ) and many political decisions are made to lead towards it .
Luciferianism provides the world elite the religious legitimacy to carry out plans that would otherwise be morally questionable or simply condemnable .
The elite , however , believes that divine knowledge can only be acquired by deserving people while the rest of the population must stay in a state of mindless stupor .
That is probably why the unsuspecting masses come every year to celebrate Christmas in this Luciferian temple without even realizing it .
While the Rockefeller Center celebrates man ’s triumph over God ’s tyranny , it also celebrates the Illuminati ’s tyranny over the ignorant man .
When accused of a crime , you need an attorney for your criminal defense case in Fort Bend County , Texas who will relentlessly fight for you and who has an insider 's knowledge of how the government operates .
Since leaving the DA 's office and opening my law firm in 2007 , I have obtained a hard - earned reputation for winning my clients ' cases with an approach that is tenacious , innovative , and state of the art .
I go on the offense from the beginning and make the State try to play catch - up .
My clients benefit from the fact that I consistently outwork and outsmart government prosecutors , many of whom are barely out of law school .
My hard work , honesty , intellect and experience has been recognized by the State Bar of Texas and by the judiciary before whom I practice .
District Court judges in Fort Bend County trust my experience and integrity so much that , on multiple occasions , they have asked me to serve as District Attorney Pro Tem in cases from which the District Attorney ’s Office has recused itself because of conflicts of interest .
This is a very high honor that only few attorneys can claim , and it's a honor indicating that I have gained the recognition and respect of the judiciary .
Two - year - old Tanvir climbed the tower on Monday
A Bengal tiger which became stuck at the top of an activity tower at a North Somerset zoo has climbed down for food .
Two - year - old Tanvir climbed to the top of the 15 ft ( 5 m ) structure at Noah 's Ark Zoo Farm in Wraxall on Monday , but was too frightened to come down .
The farm said the tiger had braved the journey down by about 2100 BST on Tuesday .
After descending the tower , Tanvir ate a pig's head and is said to be none the worse for his experience .
Christina Bush , co-owner of the zoo farm , said : " He must have been very hungry so he came down when he was ready .
" I think he enjoyed the view from the tower . "
Tanvir has been with the zoo since the summer .
Not many monthly comic books come with a glossary , but not many comics are like Unknown Soldier .
The series , written by Joshua Dysart and illustrated by Alberto Ponticelli , is set in Uganda and includes a reference guide with more than 20 entries , including background on the brutal rebel group the Lord ’s Resistance Army ; the peace activist Abdulkadir Yahya Ali , who was killed ; and the Acholi , an ethnic group from the northern part of the country .
Unknown Soldier , published by Vertigo , an imprint of DC Comics , is about Dr. Lwanga Moses , a Ugandan whose family fled the country for the United States when he was 7 .
He returns as an adult in 2002 with his wife , Sera , also a physician , hoping to put their medical skills to use in a part of the country that has experienced civil war for 15 years .
He finds a world filled with violence , boys used as soldiers and girls punished for innocent acts like riding bicycles .
Along the way he also encounters an Angelina Jolie - type character in Margaret Wells , an actress and activist .
This hardly seems like the stuff of traditional comic books , but Unknown Soldier is a regular series ; a collected edition , which reprints the first six issues , will be in bookstores beginning on Aug. 26 .
Dr. Moses , the title character , whose face is wrapped in bandages , is actually a reimagining of a DC protagonist from 1966 who was disfigured during World War II , wrapped in heavy bandages and sent on espionage missions .
No one is more surprised than Mr. Dysart that Uganda is the subject of a comic book .
A self - described history buff , he said that after 9/11 he became obsessed with researching religious extremists .
He found references to Joseph Kony , the notorious commander of the Lord ’s Resistance Army , and thought him fascinating .
So after a World War II - centered pitch was turned down , he focused on Uganda , expecting a similar answer .
“ But it was green - lit , and then I was terrified , ” Mr. Dysart said during a telephone interview from his home in Los Angeles .
I do n't do any consulting , but that does n't stop people from asking me questions .
The most common question people ask me when they want a new website is , " If you were in charge of this , who are the 2 or 3 people you ’d want to be sure to talk to – to help think through the issues , help us figure out who should do the work , etc . ? "
The second most common question people ask me , " In addition to Apple ’s site , are there 2 or 3 that you think are really appealing and work well for their business ? "
I think these are perhaps the tenth and eleventh questions you should ask , not the first two .
Here 's my list of difficult and important questions you have to answer before you spend a nickel :
What is the goal of the site ?
In other words , when it 's working great , what specific outcomes will occur ?
Who are we trying to please ?
If it 's the boss , what does she want ?
Is impressing a certain kind of person important ?
Which kind ?
How many people on your team have to be involved ?
At what level ?
Who are we trying to reach ?
Is it everyone ?
Our customers ?
A certain kind of prospect ?
What are the sites that this group has demonstrated they enjoy interacting with ?
Are we trying to close sales ?
Are we telling a story ?
Are we earning permission to follow up ?
Are we hoping that people will watch or learn ?
Do we need people to spread the word using various social media tools ?
Are we building a tribe of people who will use the site to connect with each other ?
Do people find the site via word of mouth ?
Are they looking to answer a specific question ?
Is there ongoing news and updates that need to be presented to people ?
Is the site part of a larger suite of places online where people can find out about us , or is this our one sign post ?
Is that information high in bandwidth or just little bits of data ?
Do we want people to call us ?
How many times a month would we like people to come by ?
For how long ?
Who needs to update this site ?
How often ?
How often can we afford to overhaul this site ?
Does showing up in the search engines matter ?
If so , for what terms ?
At what cost ?
Will we be willing to compromise any of the things above in order to achieve this goal ?
Will the site need to be universally accessible ?
Do issues of disability or language or browser come into it ?
How much money do we have to spend ?
How much time ?
And finally ,

The U.S. Department of Agriculture symbolically slapped the news media on the hand Thursday for perpetuating the term " swine " flu in reports about the new H1N1 strain of influenza that 's spreading across the world .
In a written statement and during two telebriefings , the USDA reminded reporters that since last Spring they have “ consistently asked that the media stop calling this ‘ novel ’ pandemic virus ‘ swine flu . ’ ”
So what 's the big deal ?
Health officials say the H1N1 virus more closely resembles the pandemic Spanish flu of 1918 than a swine flu .
The USDA says struggling pork farmers are being hurt in a big way when the virus is called “ swine flu . ” USDA officials stress that “ you cannot get infected with 2009 pandemic virus from eating pork or pork products . "
" Each time the media uses the phrase ‘ swine flu ’ a hog farmer , their workers and their families suffer , ” says USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement posted on the USDA Web site .
“ It is simply not fair or correct to associate the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza with hogs , an animal that does not play a role in the ongoing transmission of the pandemic strain . "
USDA officials point out that China is not importing U.S. pork because of the erroneous belief that eating pork is tied to the spread of this new type of flu .
I am a member of the news media and I have used both H1N1 and “ swine flu ” in my stories because some people know the virus only as “ swine flu , ” which is what it was originally labeled .
So how did the confusion start ?
Back in the spring , when we first heard about " swine " flu , it was given that name because initial tests showed it resembled some known viruses that have circulated in pigs .
However , the CDC explains on its Web site , " … further study has shown that this new virus is very different from what normally circulates in North American pigs . "
The agency explains that this new H1N1 virus has genetic material from viruses found in European and Asian pigs , as well as genes from birds and humans .
Plus , USDA officials point out that this is a human virus because it was first detected in humans .
They say there are no reports of H1N1 circulating in any swine herds here in the United States .
They acknowledge that Canada , Australia and Argentina have found H1N1 in a few pigs .
And Deputy Agriculture Secretary Dr. Kathleen Merrigan says she would n’t be surprised if the H1N1 virus does eventually surface in U.S. pig herds .
But she stresses that pigs infected with the virus would not be sent to market .
Health officials keep reminding us that the best way to avoid getting sick with this new H1N1 flu virus is to take the following precautions :
– Wash your hands frequently .
– Cough into a tissue or your sleeve , not into your hand .
– Get a regular seasonal flu shot now , and the H1N1 flu vaccine when it becomes available , allowing the highest risk groups to get their shots first .
And please do n't call it swine flu .

To illustrate his concern , Franken , who stated he had recieved a copy of the Constitution when he was sworn in , read directly from it emphasizing this part :
“ no Warrants shall issue but upon probable cause , supported by Oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized . ”
“ That ’s pretty explicit language , ” noted Franken , asking how the “ roving wiretap ” provision of the Patriot Act can meet that requirement if it does n’t require the government to name its target .
The witness replied , " this is surreal , ” apparently referring to having to respond to Franken ’s question . “
What is surreal about answering a question about the Constitution ?
The witness David Kris , assistant attorney general of the Justice Department ’s National Security Division went on to say “ I would defer to the other branch of government , ” he said , referring to the courts
I was very proud of Senator Franken .
It is awe inspiring to see someone ask hard questions and have real debates about these things .
I do not regret a single cent I forwarded to his campaign over that long slog .

Suggested helping retire Sen Frankens campaign debt if you feel so inclined .
He is really doing a good job .

Update 2 : I understand it is considered gauche to say thanks for getting on the recc list so I 'll just keep my gratefulness to myself .
BRS Labs announced a video - surveillance technology called Behavioral Analytics , which leverages cognitive reasoning , and processes visual data on a level similar to the human brain .
It is impossible for humans to monitor the tens of millions of cameras deployed throughout the world , a fact long recognized by the international security community .
Security video is either used for forensic analysis after an incident has occurred , or it employs a limited - capability technology known as Video Analytics – a video- motion and object - classification - based software technology that attempts to watch video streams and then sends an alarm on specific pre-programmed events .
The problem is that this legacy solution generates a great number of false alarms that effectively renders it useless in the real world .
BRS Labs has created a technology it calls Behavioral Analytics .
It uses cognitive reasoning , much like the human brain , to process visual data and to identify criminal and terroristic activities .
Built on a framework of cognitive learning engines and computer vision , AISight , provides an automated and scalable surveillance solution that analyzes behavioral patterns , activities and scene content without the need for human training , setup , or programming .
The system learns autonomously , and builds cognitive “ memories ” while continuously monitoring a scene through the “ eyes ” of a CCTV security camera .
It sees and then registers the context of what constitutes normal behavior , and the software distinguishes and alerts on abnormal behavior without requiring any special programming , definition of rules or virtual trip lines .
AISight is currently fielded across a wide variety of global critical infrastructure assets , protecting major international hotels , banking institutions , seaports , nuclear facilities , airports and dense urban areas plagued by criminal activity .

The Williams team is planning to use KERS in next year 's car , despite the Formula One Teams ' Association having agreed to drop the system voluntarily .
FOTA teams announced in June that they would not be using KERS in 2010 as they deemed the technology , used by a minority of squad this year , was too expensive .
The pact , however , could now collapse , with Williams having confirmed it is continuing with the development of its KERS with the intention of using it in next year 's car .
" We fully support the use of KERS and always have done , " Williams technical director Sam Michael said on Tuesday .
" Given the environmental and sustainability pressures that Formula 1 is going to face in the future , KERS is a positive step for the sport .
" It 's in next year 's regulations , so we 're continuing developing our system with a view to using it on next year 's FW32 . "
Williams , developing a flywheel - based KERS , has not used the system this season .
The Grove team recently rejoined FOTA after it was suspended earlier this year when it broke ranks with the rest of FOTA and entered the 2010 world championship before the FIA 's initial deadline .
Only McLaren and Ferrari have been using KERS regularly this year .
Aaah , this is so cuuuute !!
May I ask , if you have a recipe for this ?

The mayor of Hampstead , Maryland , will replace the town ’s municipal flag with the Gadsen flag on September 1 , a press release reports .
Newly elected mayor Haven N. Shoemaker ordered the switch through executive order to protest anticipated cuts in state funding to local governments including Hampstead .
Tea Party activists in Sacramento , California , display the Gadsen flag .
“ We have the so - called stimulus which is nothing more than an unprecedented issuance of debt .
We have ObamaCare .
In Maryland , we have a complete failure by Governor O’Malley and the Legislature to balance the state budget , ” Shoemaker said .
“ The $ 3.8 billion in federal money sent to Maryland was wasted on pork barrel projects and social program spending rather than on rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure .
Now the State is dumping their failure of fiscal leadership into our laps . ”
Shoemaker hopes other mayors will follow suit .
“ Maybe this wo n’t amount to anything .
Maybe other local governments will decide to join us .
In any event , the people in Hampstead will know that there is still one level of government left in America that is of the people , by the people and for the people . ”

The flag was designed by and is named after American general and statesman Christopher Gadsden .
The use of the timber rattlesnake on the yellow flag as a symbol of the American colonies can be traced back to the publications of Benjamin Franklin .
In 1751 , he made the first reference to the rattlesnake in a satirical commentary published in his Pennsylvania Gazette .
It had been the policy of Britain to send convicted criminals to America , and Franklin suggested that they thank the British by sending rattlesnakes to England .
During the Revolutionary War , the snake image was used as a symbol of the colonies .
Since the Revolution , the flag has seen times of reintroduction as both a symbol of American patriotism and as a symbol of disagreement with the government .
The Gadsen flag was adopted by the Tea Party movement .
Earlier this year , the Missouri Information Analysis Center characterized the flag as “ anti- government propaganda ” displayed by militia members .
In the months ahead , as state and local governments go bankrupt and are unable to fulfill their commitments , the “ rightwing extremist ” Gadsen flag may be adopted by other cities and municipalities around the country as a form of protest against an out of control federal government .

As porn goes , so goes the nation .
massive layoffs .
You know the old saying : " " Okay , Imade it up , but it 's true .
Our nation 's latest economic bellwether is thesex industry .
You see , once I learned that the global recession had put Czech hookers out of work , I began to wonder whether our home - grown American hookers have also given new meaning to the phrase " It 's not easy finding sex workers to interview .
Indeed , upon calling several Los Angeles - based escort services , I was shocked at the shabby customer service I received .
But I did hear from many in what I think of as the sexertainmentindustry – porn sites , gentlemen 's clubs , sex toy companies .
Because those people hire publicists .
And their business is -- pardon the pun -- on the rise .
Take Red Light Center : a virtual world , like Second Life , but with rampant cybersex .
Begun in 2004 , Red Light Center 's membership has grown during the recession , doubling each year for the past two years .
Founder Brian
Shuster reports that some members now earn up to ten thousand a month -- in real - world money -- as virtual avatar prostitutes .
Which means it 's entirely possible that some socially awkward , dubiously hygienic computer geek living in his parents ' basement is getting rich as a cartoon call girl .
"
The holodeck is the future of the internet , " Shuster says .
" As soon as the web transforms to 3D , we 've got The Matrix .
" So why is his business up in a downturn ?
Shuster points to the pastime 's relative affordability .
Admission to Night Candy , a virtual gentlemen 's club , is just 80 cents .
A lap dance is only 50 cents and -- since this is n't the real world -- the drinks and drugs are free .
Compare that to the cost of a night out at the newly reopened Scores in Manhattan : admission on weekends is $ 30 , and a real private dance will set you back 20 bucks .
The management of Scores has gambled on opening a high - end gentlemen 's club during a recession on the theory that the jet set may not be buying jets , but they can still afford a night out .
Given that a similar outfit , the New York - based Hustler Club , says it has barely felt the effects of the down economy , the decision may prove prescient .
Meanwhile , sex toys have gone mainstream enough that pioneer adult businesses like Good Vibrations now face stiff competition from Amazon , of all places .
( " Customers who bought the Kindle also bought Astroglide Strawberry Lube . " )
So why are these segments of the sex industry thriving while DVD sales and rentals of porn are down by as much as 40 % ?
The answer says less about the recession and more about the emerging New Economy .
What separates successful sexertainment ventures from your dad 's bowm - chicka - bowm - bowm - music porn is its interactivity .
As with the rest of the entertainment industry -- books , music , and video -- passive participation is becoming passé .
Which is why the only thing on the internet more popular than porn is social networking .
Those who disdain virtual reality as inferior to actual reality are no different from the 18th - century moralists who condemned the escapism of reading novels .
Sure , interactive games are n't as satisfying as real life -- but they 've captured the public 's imagination in a way that books , film and TV cannot .
( Why read or watch The Lord of the Rings when you can be in World of Warcraft ? ) Smart sex businesses understand this and are investing in emerging strategies .
One business , Pink Visual , lets you download porn to your iPhone .
It 's only a matter of time before an enterprising entrepreneur figures out how to set a cell phone to vibrator instead of vibrate .
And anyone concerned about the state of human interaction can see that people are still investing in real - life encounters .
Tickets are selling out -- at hundreds of dollars apiece -- for San Francisco 's 30th Annual Exotic Erotic Ball , " a celebration of flesh , fetish and fantasy " featuring Pricasso , an artist who paints with his penis .
Because some things still need to be experienced in this dimension .
So forget Wall Street versus Main Street .
The answers to the economy lie in the Red Light District .
No one recognizes this better than Seth Steele , owner of Diamond Companions , the one escort service that actually returned my call .
Serving 17 cities nationwide , Steele 's business provides a surprisingly accurate barometer of the national economy .
( Steele has hired a number of former real - estate agents as escorts . )
And while Steele 's clients in the financial and auto industries have " all but disappeared , " he says , he credits the surge in virtual entertainment as the reason he had to triple his staff at last month 's Comic Con in San Diego .
And even though business is still down overall , guess which city has bucked the national trend , with a 30 percent increase in escorts in the past year ?
None other than Washington , D.C. Which can only mean that recovery 's on the way .
And that , my friends , is The Upside .

The billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch suffered the indignity of seeing his global empire make a huge financial loss yesterday and promptly pledged to shake up the newspaper industry by introducing charges for access to all his news websites , including the Times , the Sun and the News of the World , by next summer .
Stung by a collapse in advertising revenue as the recession shredded Fleet Street ’s traditional business model , Murdoch declared that the era of a free - for - all in online news was over .
“ Quality journalism is not cheap , ” said Murdoch .
“ The digital revolution has opened many new and inexpensive distribution channels but it has not made content free .
We intend to charge for all our news websites . ”
What does “ quality journalism ” have to do with Murdoch ’s tabloids ?
The Australian - born press and television baron was speaking as his News Corporation holding company slumped to a $ 3.4 billion net loss for the financial year to June , hit by huge writedowns in the value of its assets , restructuring charges and a dive in commercial revenue …
At present , only the Wall Street Journal charges a fee for online access and until recently , received wisdom in the publishing industry was that readers would not pay to read newspapers on the internet …
He accepted that there could be a need for furious litigation to prevent stories and photographs being copied elsewhere : “ We ’ll be asserting our copyright at every point … ”
The group ’s television division , including its
Fox stations in the US and Star networks in Asia , saw profits fall from $ 1.12 bn to $ 174m .
Should be an interesting couple of years .
The few pundits in the world of tech that I consider worth reading on this topic – pretty much agree Murdoch ’s plan stinks on ice .
His plan to sue everyone should deliver about as much of a return as it did for the RIAA .
The world is heading for a catastrophic energy crunch that could cripple a global economic recovery because most of the major oil fields in the world have passed their peak production , a leading energy economist has warned .
Higher oil prices brought on by a rapid increase in demand and a stagnation , or even decline , in supply could blow any recovery off course , said Dr Fatih Birol , the chief economist at the respected International Energy Agency ( IEA ) in Paris , which is charged with the task of assessing future energy supplies by OECD countries .
In an interview with The Independent , Dr Birol said that the public and many governments appeared to be oblivious to the fact that the oil on which modern civilisation depends is running out far faster than previously predicted and that global production is likely to peak in about 10 years – at least a decade earlier than most governments had estimated .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But the first detailed assessment of more than 800 oil fields in the world , covering three quarters of global reserves , has found that most of the biggest fields have already peaked and that the rate of decline in oil production is now running at nearly twice the pace as calculated just two years ago .
On top of this , there is a problem of chronic under - investment by oil - producing countries , a feature that is set to result in an " oil crunch " within the next five years which will jeopardise any hope of a recovery from the present global economic recession , he said .
In a stark warning to Britain and the other Western powers , Dr Birol said that the market power of the very few oil - producing countries that hold substantial reserves of oil – mostly in the Middle East – would increase rapidly as the oil crisis begins to grip after 2010 .
" One day we will run out of oil , it is not today or tomorrow , but one day we will run out of oil and we have to leave oil before oil leaves us , and we have to prepare ourselves for that day , " Dr Birol said .
" The earlier we start , the better , because all of our economic and social system is based on oil , so to change from that will take a lot of time and a lot of money and we should take this issue very seriously , " he said .
" The market power of the very few oil - producing countries , mainly in the Middle East , will increase very quickly .
They already have about 40 per cent share of the oil market and this will increase much more strongly in the future , " he said .
There is now a real risk of a crunch in the oil supply after next year when demand picks up because not enough is being done to build up new supplies of oil to compensate for the rapid decline in existing fields .
The IEA estimates that the decline in oil production in existing fields is now running at 6.7 per cent a year compared to the 3.7 per cent decline it had estimated in 2007 , which it now acknowledges to be wrong .
" If we see a tightness of the markets , people in the street will see it in terms of higher prices , much higher than we see now .
It will have an impact on the economy , definitely , especially if we see this tightness in the markets in the next few years , " Dr Birol said .

" It will be especially important because the global economy will still be very fragile , very vulnerable .
Many people think there will be a recovery in a few years ' time but it will be a slow recovery and a fragile recovery and we will have the risk that the recovery will be strangled with higher oil prices , " he told The Independent .
In its first - ever assessment of the world 's major oil fields , the IEA concluded that the global energy system was at a crossroads and that consumption of oil was " patently unsustainable " , with expected demand far outstripping supply .
Oil production has already peaked in non-Opec countries and the era of cheap oil has come to an end , it warned .
In most fields , oil production has now peaked , which means that other sources of supply have to be found to meet existing demand .
Even if demand remained steady , the world would have to find the equivalent of four Saudi Arabias to maintain production , and six Saudi Arabias if it is to keep up with the expected increase in demand between now and 2030 , Dr Birol said .
" It 's a big challenge in terms of the geology , in terms of the investment and in terms of the geopolitics .
So this is a big risk and it 's mainly because of the rates of the declining oil fields , " he said .
" Many governments now are more and more aware that at least the day of cheap and easy oil is over ... [ however ]
I 'm not very optimistic about governments being aware of the difficulties we may face in the oil supply , " he said .
Environmentalists fear that as supplies of conventional oil run out , governments will be forced to exploit even dirtier alternatives , such as the massive reserves of tar sands in Alberta , Canada , which would be immensely damaging to the environment because of the amount of energy needed to recover a barrel of tar - sand oil compared to the energy needed to collect the same amount of crude oil .
" Just because oil is running out faster than we have collectively assumed , does not mean the pressure is off on climate change , " said Jeremy Leggett , a former oil - industry consultant and now a green entrepreneur with Solar Century .
" Shell and others want to turn to tar , and extract oil from coal .
But these are very carbon - intensive processes , and will deepen the climate problem , " Dr Leggett said .
" What we need to do is accelerate the mobilisation of renewables , energy efficiency and alternative transport .
" We have to do this for global warming reasons anyway , but the imminent energy crisis redoubles the imperative , " he said .
Oil :
An unclear future
* Why is oil so important as an energy source ?
Crude oil has been critical for economic development and the smooth functioning of almost every aspect of society .
Agriculture and food production is heavily dependent on oil for fuel and fertilisers .
In the US , for instance , it takes the direct and indirect use of about six barrels of oil to raise one beef steer .
It is the basis of most transport systems .
Oil is also crucial to the drugs and chemicals industries and is a strategic asset for the military .
* How are oil reserves estimated ?
The amount of oil recoverable is always going to be an assessment subject to the vagaries of economics – which determines the price of the oil and whether it is worth the costs of pumping it out –and technology , which determines how easy it is to discover and recover .
Probable reserves have a better than 50 per cent chance of getting oil out .
Possible reserves have less than 50 per cent chance .
* Why is there such disagreement over oil reserves ?
All numbers tend to be informed estimates .
Different experts make different assumptions so it is under - standable that they can come to different conclusions .
Some countries see the size of their oilfields as a national security issue and do not want to provide accurate information .
Another problem concerns how fast oil production is declining in fields that are past their peak production .
The rate of decline can vary from field to field and this affects calculations on the size of the reserves .
A further factor is the expected size of future demand for oil .
* What is " peak oil " and when will it be reached ?
This is the point when the maximum rate at which oil is extracted reaches a peak because of technical and geological constraints , with global production going into decline from then on .
The UK Government , along with many other governments , has believed that peak oil will not occur until well into the 21st Century , at least not until after 2030 .
The International Energy Agency believes peak oil will come perhaps by 2020 .
But it also believes that we are heading for an even earlier " oil crunch " because demand after 2010 is likely to exceed dwindling supplies .
* With global warming , why should we be worried about peak oil ?
There are large reserves of non-conventional oil , such as the tar sands of Canada .
But this oil is dirty and will produce vast amounts of carbon dioxide which will make a nonsense of any climate change agreement .
Another problem concerns how fast oil production is declining in fields that are past their peak production .
The rate of decline can vary from field to field and this affects calculations on the size of the reserves .
If we are not adequately prepared for peak oil , global warming could become far worse than expected .

Apple Engineers missed a key opportunity to implement an industry - standard technology in their latest operating system that would have made it more resistant to hacking attacks , three researchers have said .
Known as ASLR , or address space layout randomization , the measure picks a different memory location to load system components each time the OS is started .
While Microsoft has had it implemented since the roll - out of Windows Vista , the analogous protection in Snow Leopard , which went on sale Friday , suffers from a crucial deficiency :
It fails to randomize core parts of the OS , including the heap , stack and dynamic linker .
That means that attackers who identify buffer overflows and similar bugs in OS X components have a much better chance of causing the vulnerability to execute malicious code that compromises the machine .
The halfhearted attempt at implementing ASLR has been a chief complaint of security researchers since Leopard , Snow Leopard 's predecessor .
Many had hoped it would be made more robust in the new version .
" ASLR is really only useful if EVERYTHING is randomized , " Charlie Miller , co-author of The Mac Hacker 's Handbook , wrote in an email to The Register .
" If there is anything that is not randomized , it defeats the purpose mostly .
This is a major shortcoming of Apple , and I 'm disappointed they did n't take this opportunity to implement full ASLR . "
Dino Dai Zovi , who also co-authored the Mac - hacking book , and fellow researcher Rich Mogull , CEO of Surosis , agreed that there is no discernible improvement in Snow Leopard 's implementation of ASLR compared with Leopard .
" Randomizing the location of dyld is no small task , but Apple had a perfect opportunity to make the change with Snow Leopard since so many other important parts of the operating system were being updated , " Mogull wrote here .
" With dyld in place , an attacker has a roadmap to continue their exploitation and potentially take over your system . "
What 's more , as applications built for Snow Leopard proliferate , it may make it harder for Apple to add the feature later on , Dai Zovi said .
" The concern among many people in the security community is when will that change and how quickly , " he said in an interview .
Not that the new OS has n't improved some security offerings .
One , called DEP , has been greatly expanded in Snow Leopard .
It prevents shellcode and similar data that is supplied by a user from being executed by the OS .
Had OS X had the protection over the past two Pwn2 Own hacking contests neither of Miller 's winning exploit entries would have worked .
One possible weakness with the new DEP offering : several parts of the Safari browser remain both writable and executable , a shortcoming that may make it easier for attackers to strike at one of the most targeted Apple applications .
QuickTime has also been mostly rewritten from scratch .
While the jury is still out on how big an improvement the new code base contains , Miller said a vulnerability that works in the most recent version of Leopard does n't work in the QuickTime for Snow Leopard .
Another improvement : Several highly targeted OS X components , including the H.264 video codec , now come with sandboxing , which tightly restricts the types of activities they can carry out .
Apple has made additional changes , including expanded menu options in its firewall and Safari plug-ins that run as separate processes .
While Mogull said the latter should make it harder to exploit buggy add - ons , Dai Zovi worried that the change might allow attackers to repeatedly crash them unbeknownst to the user .
And as reported earlier , Snow Leopard comes with new malware protection that in some cases warns users if they are about to install a malicious file .
The feature is extremely limited at the moment , but it would n't be surprising to see Apple expand the offering over time .
No doubt , all the new features will be used and abused over the coming weeks and months , as researchers and hackers put them through their paces .
As they report their results , we 'll bring them to you here first . ®
Stoner Horror
" Stoner Horror " is a relatively new genre of horror movies .
Many critics claim " Idle Hands " to be the forerunner which popularized the genre -- I think it was Jessica Alba 's appearance in the movie .
Either way , you 'll notice a recurring theme in most of these movies ; marijuana , gore , skin and humor .
The humor , in many cases , is unintentional .
Many people will argue that films like Eraser Head and Donnie Darko should have been included in this list , but I disagree .
There 's no way I could jumble those two classics in with this bunch .
After watching these trailers , hopefully you 'll agree .
There 's a considerable difference between horror movies that are cool while stoned and Stoner Horror as a genre .
Evil Bong I & II - Dude , It 's One SCARY Trip !
Centered around 3 stoner roommates who answer a classified advertisement featuring a bong that may or may not be cursed , we 're not really sure how this movie ever received the green light for part two .
The bong does of course turn out to be cursed , transporting tokers to an alternate dimension called Bong World , which is really nothing more than a strip club filled with beautiful women in need of souls .
Sounds like California !
" Evil Bong " should by no means be taken seriously , and as long as you watch it with an open mind and a laid back attitude , you should find it charming and quirky in alot of ways which should help you ignore the sheer absurdity of a movie about a bong , with bad intentions that manages to suck a few stoners into an alternate dimension .

The cast of the film is bad .
No one here is worth mentioning by name .
Everyone is uniformly terrible , and while this creates some unintentional humor , it lowers the film quite a bit .
When your best actor is a satellite character who spouts profanities , you know you ’ve cast the film poorly .
But at least some of the chicks are hot .
The review may seem a little harsh , but I ’m not a stoner so it gets no pass from me on that account .
I ’m also bemused at the way Full Moon continues to make garbage like this instead of good old fashioned horror flicks like they used to .
Despite all of this , Evil Bong 2 is n’t a terrible movie … it just does n’t have much going for it … but if somehow you manage to make it to the end of the movie , you ’re in for a damn treat when the credits roll .

Eat Me! - Sometimes You Get the Munchies ... Sometimes They Get You !
Garage band General Malacarne are practicing their latest set in the basement when a mysterious blackout hits Brooklyn .
While the band kicks back with some joints downstairs , everyone above - ground is transformed into ravenous zombies .
Hilarious complications arise as the band realizes their predicament , and embark on a half - baked scheme to escape the city .
The picture is crisp , the sound is clear , the editing is tight , and the film manages to take place in a lot of outdoor locations yet the narrative stays coherent during transportation scenes .
For the last part of the film , the characters are constantly on the move .
These factors normally spell doom for independent productions .
Director Katie Carman , however , deftly dances around these potential pitfalls and makes them work for her .
For its inventiveness , Calloway 's great performance , and the commendable production values , EAT ME ! is a zombie comedy movie that I hope finds an audience .
It may not satisfy your hunger for a big , gory zombie spectacle , but it has a lot going for it to satisfy your other zombie cravings .
With EAT ME !
as her first feature , Katie Carman has proven that she could be a very capable director of bigger - budget feature films .
I look forward to her work in the future .

Little * ucker - The Last True Party Animal
I have n't seen this flick , but judging by the trailer , it 's a must see .
A gremlin type creature whose blood lust is only held in check by smoking marijuana .
When the dope runs out , you 're fucked .
Pretty steamy lesbian scene in this one .
Definitely NSFW .
The Tripper - On 4.20 , Hippie Blood Will Trickle Down
Brought to you by the distorted mind of David Arquette , this stoner horror film is filled with gore and plenty of humor .
All hell breaks loose at the American Free Love Festival when a disgruntled Ronald Reagan fanatic decides to embark on a killing spree , targeting a group of hippies .
Guaranteed to make you laugh and forever alter your image of our 40th President .
Unlike a lot of horror films today The Tripper is original and fresh , full of violence , loads of humor , political innuendo and a very unique style .
With the help of this excellent DVD release we now have ourselves a movie that acts very much like a drug :
Once you 're exposed to it , you 're hooked .

Shrooms - Get Ready to Get Wasted
A magic mushroom enhanced vacation to the Irish countryside turns bad for four dumb American college students .
This film does capture the spirit of using magic mushrooms and it all seems like a bad trip gone worse .. the shifting in and out the visions are well captured on film .
There is one line that summed it up : " We ca n't all be having the same trip , can we ? "
It is a scary story with some twists that make you want to see the film again ( and best seen when you are not tripping yourself ) .

Idle Hands - The Touching Story of a Boy and His Right Hand
Arguably the movie that started the genre , " Idle Hands " garnered much of its success from starlet Jessica Alba , who has of course moved on to bigger things since .
The movie centers around Anton ( Devon Sawa ) , a high school slacker whose only ambition is to get high and chill with his friends Mick ( Seth Green ) and Pnub .
The movie gets interesting when Anton 's right hand becomes possessed by Satan and after sawing it off , he chases after it in order to protect his girlfriend from its evil grasp .
This weekend the New York Times published a piece called Using ‘ Free ’ to Turn a Profit .
The piece focused on Evernote , a web - based and smart - phone based application for taking notes , snapping pictures , and storing stuff you want to remember later .
The following critique is n’t about Evernote ( it ’s an impressive product which a lot of people love ) .
It ’s about the incredibly low bar for “ success ” in our industry and how the tech - business press perpetuates the perception .
( ugh , did I just turn into one of those who blames “ the media ” ?
Yes , on this one , I did . )
Let ’s erase one claim right off the bat .
The headline , “ Using ‘ Free ’ to Turn a Profit ” , is misleading and downright false as it relates to the subject of the story .
Near the end of the piece Phil Libin , the chief executive of Evernote , says they are generating about $ 79,000 / month in revenue .
Then the article goes on to say “ By January 2011 , Mr. Libin projects , the company will break even . ”
$ 79,000 / month and they wo n’t break even until January 2011 .
So every day they ’re losing money until 2011 .
And the title of the piece is “ Using ‘ Free ’ to Turn a Profit ” .
What ?
How can the Times let a headline like this slide ?
Then yesterday a piece pops up on Gigaom called How Freemium Can Work for Your Startup .
This piece references the “ Using ‘ Free ’ to Turn a Profit ” New York Times piece .
Om Malik says
“ And it in reading Damon ’s article , the qualities of a successful freemium product finally became clear to me . ”
Then in the next paragraph
Om acknowledges that Evernote does n’t generate enough revenue to turn a profit .
Later he says “ I ’m sure there are many more ways to build great freemium applications , but one [ Evernote ] has stood out for me above all the others . ”
The product may be excellent , but until their business cracks a profit I do n’t see how Om can say it ’s a model for how to build a freemium application ( or a business ) .
This pattern — “ success ” based on forecasted future success instead of current success — shows up all over the tech - business press .
Instead of metrics like “ they make more money than they spend ” we see stuff like “ user count growth ” and “ followers ” and “ impressions ” and “ friends ” and “ visits ” qualify success .
Whenever you see someone piling big numbers into made up metrics , it ’s a diversion .
They want you to think that this time it ’s different .
But like Judge Judy says , “ If it does n’t make sense it is n’t true . ”
Do n’t agree ?
Would you take your next paycheck in page views ?
or users ?
or followers ?
or visitors ?
or eyeballs ( remember that one from the 90s ) ?
Go down to the corner store and plunk down a million impressions for a gum ball .
They ’ll probably call the cops .
If there was an airline that flew more passengers than anyone else , but lost money on each one , would we call it a success ?
If there was a restaurant that served more people than anyone else , but lost money on each meal served , would we call it a success ?
If there was a store that sold more product than anyone else , but took a loss on each one , would we call it a success ?
Would the business press hold these companies up as business model successes ?
Would anyone ?
Interesting , maybe .
Promising , sure .
But successful ?
Then what the hell is going on with the coverage of our industry ?
What ’s the rush ?
Why not wait until their business is proven ?
Would n’t the Evernote story have been 10 x better if they ’d actually been able to say “ We ’re making money with this model .
It works . ”
Would n’t the New York Times be doing its readers a service by providing insight into a proven model with a proven example ?
Instead , we get an article titled “ turn a profit ” about a company that is over a year away from meeting that definition .
There are thousands of interesting internet - based businesses that are actually turning a profit — and I know of dozens running the freemium model that are deep in the black .
Pick one and write a great true story .
Why all the fiction ?
It still blows me away that David ’s talk at Startup School 2008 was met with such enthusiasm ( I know David was surprised too ) .
The talk was simple .
Come up with a product , charge money for it , make more money than it costs to run it , and you turn a profit !
This is the formula that ’s been in place since business began .
Yet in front of a group of new tech entrepreneurs it seemed like a revelation , a brand new story never told before .
David said people were coming up to him in droves after the speech thanking him for opening their eyes .
Who closed them ?
So I guess what ultimately bothers me most about this New York Times piece , and many other pieces just like it ( see TechCrunch daily ) , is the example that ’s being set for the next generation of entrepreneurs .
They ’re seeing business success defined as “ the projections say we ’ll profitable later ” .
They ’re constantly being exposed to excuses .
They ’re being taught that profits are these things that only happen one day far away .
That ’s just wrong .
NORTHCOM
Northern Command
The Homeland Security Command
The Northern Command , the Pentagon 's new Homeland Defense Command , was first commanded by the general who was in charge of defending New York and Washington airspace on 9/11
General Ralph Eberhart , who was in charge of NORAD ( air defense ) on 9/11 , was made the first commander of the " Northern Command , " the domestic unified military command established in October 2002 .
If the domestic use of the U.S. military escalates into full - scale martial law , the Northern Command would essentially manage it .
If 9/11 had been an " intelligence failure , " it is likely that General Eberhart would have been court - martialed instead of promoted .
The creation of NORTHCOM in April 2002 , constitutes a blatant violation of both Canadian and Mexican territorial sovereignty .
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld announced unilaterally that US Northern Command would have jurisdiction over the entire North American region .
Canada and Mexico were presented with a fait accompli .
US Northern Command 's jurisdiction as outlined by the US DoD includes , in addition to the continental US , all of Canada , Mexico , as well as portions of the Caribbean , contiguous waters in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans up to 500 miles off the Mexican , US and Canadian coastlines as well as the Canadian Arctic .

Deployed in the USA : The Militarization of the Home Front
The phrase posse comitatus refers to the sheriff ’s common law power to call upon the male population of a county for assistance in enforcing the laws .
Enacted by Congress in 1878 , the Posse Comitatus Act forbids law enforcement officials to employ the U.S. military for that purpose .
16 The act consists of a single sentence : Whoever , except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress , willfully uses any part of the Army as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years , or both .
... even though the act has clearly been violated any number of times since its passage , the Department of Justice has never prosecuted anyone for violating the act .
The views expressed by Gen. Eberhart , the newly appointed commander of all U.S. armed forces within North America , are particularly troubling .
In October 2002 Eberhart became head of the new Northern Command , responsible for homeland defense -- the first time since America ’s founding that the command of all military personnel in North America has been centralized under a single officer .
32
So long as the military confines itself to its traditional role , the new homeland command is , in itself , no cause for concern .
But Gen. Eberhart has repeatedly contemplated a broader role for the military .
In September 2002 , for example , Eberhart said , “ My view has been that Posse Comitatus will constantly be under review as we mature this command . ”
33 He did not elaborate on what that “ maturation ” process will entail .
...
a powerful data - mining system called Total Information Awareness .
44 Such a system could potentially allow the government to track the routine activities of Americans , from travel plans to credit card transactions to medical records .
In response to public outcry , Congress shut down the Office of Information ....
Though some DARPA officials envisioned turning the system over to civilian law enforcement , it ’s clear that military officials were keenly interested in the technology .
In November 2002 Maj. Gen. Dale Meyerrose , chief information technology officer for NORTHCOM , said : “ I ’ve been to [ visit ] Admiral Poindexter .
He and I are talking about TIA . ”
In the middle of the sniper ordeal , Maryland governor Parris Glendening announced that he was considering using the National Guard to provide security at polling places on Election Day .
72 Consider the ominous image of armed soldiers surrounding American polling places .
That is an image one would normally associate with a banana republic , not a free , democratic one .
In the heightened threat environment of the post–September 11 world , there is a real danger that the military will be called in for any high - profile

" Homeland Defense " and the Militarisation of America
by Frank Morales
Project Censored Update , September 2003
www.globalresearch.ca 15 September 2003
" [ Nearly 70 % of the military budget ] is to provide men and weapons to fight in foreign countries in support of our allies and friends and for offensive operations in Third World countries ..
Another big chunk of the defense budget is the 20 % allocated for our offensive nuclear force of bombers , missles , and submarines whose job it is to carry nuclear weapons to the Soviet Union ...
Actual defense of the United States costs about 10 % of the military budget and is the least expensive function performed by the Pentagon ... "

Military Practices Procedures for Shooting Down Airliners Each Week , Commander Says
By Matt Kelley Associated Press Writer
Published : Oct 2 , 2003WASHINGTON ( AP ) - The U.S. military practices at least twice each week for the nightmare scenario of having to shoot down a civilian airliner hijacked by terrorists , the commander of forces in North America said Thursday .
Gen. Ralph E. Eberhart , head of U.S. Northern Command , said a strong set of safeguards are in place to prevent an accidental or unwarranted shootdown of a commercial airplane .
Commanders , pilots and air defense crews are drilled on those procedures as many as four times each week , Eberhart said .
The rules allow for an order to shoot down a civilian plane only if there is no other option to prevent a Sept. 11 - style attack on the ground , the general said .
There are authentication procedures for such orders to make sure " someone ca n't just get on the radio and say , ' This is the president , I order you to shoot down that plane , ' " Eberhart said .
Military jets were in the air during the 2001 attacks but were too far away to shoot down the planes before they struck the World Trade Center and Pentagon .
Airline passengers can be confident that their planes will not be accidentally shot down , Eberhart said .
" I would take issue with anyone who would say the men and women in our armed forces are trigger happy , " Eberhart said at a breakfast meeting with reporters .
" I 'm more worried that they would be trigger hesitant than trigger happy .
We have long discussions with people to see if they 're ready to do this . "
Eberhart said he has never heard of a case where a pilot or missile battery operator was hesitant to shoot down a hijacked airliner .
Those involved have repeated psychological screening and testing on the procedures to make sure they will follow those rules , Eberhart said .
The Pentagon created Northern Command in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks to coordinate military defense of the United States and response to attacks or natural disasters .
Eberhart , a four - star general from the Air Force , said the al - Qaida terrorist network responsible for the attacks two years ago has been seriously damaged .
" Most of the varsity players are gone .
In most cases we 're dealing with the junior varsity team or the freshman team , " Eberhart said .
" But we can't rest on our laurels .
We 've got to keep the throttle up ...
If anything , I think we 've bought ourselves some time . "
The arrests of three workers at the Guantanamo Bay prison camp for terrorist suspects have illustrated a concern about terrorists trying to penetrate the U.S. military , Eberhart said .
The general said he had no indications of any coordinated terrorist effort to recruit American troops but said he had no doubt such efforts were happening .
" There 's no doubt that there are people out there trying to turn our people , " Eberhart said .
" I 'm sure there are people right now being worked on as we speak , and it 's not working , and they 're reporting it . "

6 Jets Launched to Patrol in the East as a Precaution
By Bradley Graham and John Mintz
Washington Post Staff Writers
Friday , August 15 , 2003 ; Page A11
In the first minutes after yesterday 's power blackout , the Pentagon
launched two Air Force F - 16 fighter jets to patrol skies between New
York and Washington , and put other military aircraft on alert at
eastern U.S. bases , defense officials said .
But federal and regional authorities quickly determined that the
electrical shutdown was not caused by a terrorist act and did not
reflect a national security threat , the officials said .
The sudden paralyzing blow to a large section of the country provided
the first test of the emergency response network set up after the
Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
Initial accounts by some of the
officials involved suggest that communications were quickly
established among key military and intelligence centers , regional
crisis centers and electric power industry executives .
Plugging into an elaborate conference call network were authorities
at the White House , the Pentagon , the CIA , the FBI , the Department of
Homeland Security and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , in addition
to other agencies .
U.S. intelligence officials , urgently scanning the latest information
available from around the world , found no reports of heightened
threat warnings overseas .
" It was pretty clear pretty quickly that the blackout was a power
plant problem , " said one military official who was in the Pentagon's
operations center during the initial phase of the power outage .
While terrorism was ruled out , the Pentagon bolstered the country 's
air defenses as a precaution .
The scrambling of the fighter jets
recalled the constant combat air patrol missions that were initiated
over major U.S. cities after the Sept. 11 attacks .
Those flights gave
way last year to occasional , random patrols , but with contingency
plans by the North American Aerospace Defense command ( NORAD ) to
resume more intense coverage if necessary .
" NORAD has no reason to believe there 's an imminent airborne threat , "
a defense official said .
But , he added , the decision was made to send
the extra fighters aloft and put others on alert " as a precautionary
measure . "
The planes took off from Andrews Air Force Base .
Said another military official : " We could have had more fighters
airborne in five minutes . "
Defense officials braced for the possibility that New York and other
major cities left without power might request federal troops to
maintain order and back up local police .
Officials also prepared for
possible appeals for generators , cots , medical equipment or other
emergency assistance .
But by last night , no such requests had come .
" We 're closely monitoring the situation , " said Michael Perini ,
spokesman for Northern Command , another post - 9/11 creation , this one
established to coordinate the military 's response to domestic
emergencies .
" We 're anticipating where we feel the military can help ,
from communications to medical services to setting up places where
people could sleep . "
" This is the first major incident to affect a part of the nation 's
critical infrastructure since the launch [ in March ] of the Department
of Homeland Security , and we are responding , " said Brian Roehrkasse ,
a department spokesman .
" We 're communicating with and working closely
with the industry sector involved , which is how things are supposed
to work . "
Within moments of the start of the blackout , the department 's command
center at its headquarters in Northwest Washington contacted
Consolidated Edison Inc. and other key electrical grid industry
officials , using prearranged communications plans .
" We immediately
started receiving information from them in real time , " he said .
Within minutes , Homeland Security officials were notifying other
government agencies that the problem likely stemmed from an
electrical overload rather than an act of sabotage .
Homeland Security -- which now incorporates the Federal Emergency
Management Agency -- also stood by with crisis teams , medical units
and aircraft .
But " no states have asked for any federal assistance , "
Roehrkasse said .
" Backup generators are working , and states and
localities are dealing with it . "

Pentagon juggles politics of creating North American command
By Sydney J. Freedberg Jr. , National Journal
As it knits together a new command for the defense of North America , the Pentagon is having to unravel a tangle of special interests , ranging from Canada and Congress to the Coast Guard and the Governors .
No wonder it 's taking so long .
For 50 years , the Pentagon has divided the world among a handful of four - star officers : the regional commanders in chief , whose influence in their areas of the globe has grown so great that The Washington Post , in a series of articles a year before Sept. 11 , likened them to the proconsuls of the Roman Empire .
But throughout those 50 years , no " CINC " -- as they are always called in the Pentagon -- has had authority over Canada , Mexico , or the continental United States itself .
That is about to change .
On September 11 , the United States itself became the battleground .
So , although recent leaks show that the details are still being worked out , the Defense Department has resolved to establish a new " Northern Command . "
The secret to the success of the existing U.S. regional CINCs has been as much about adapting to local conditions as about imposing a common model .
Even Rome 's theoretically autocratic proconsuls had to tread carefully around local sensibilities , and their U.S. heirs are little different .
....
History is littered with defeated forces that never quite cleared up who was in charge .
On December 7 , 1941 , Japanese raiders caught U.S. forces off guard in large part because the separate commanders for the Army and Navy in Hawaii failed to coordinate their activities .
[ actually , President Roosevelt knew the attacks were coming and kept the commanders in Hawaii out of the loop of the intercepts of Japanese radio traffic , since FDR needed the attacks in order to galvanize a divided nation to support entry into the war ]
After the war , the Pentagon established " unified commands " precisely to end such confusion .
Under that system , one officer controls all forces in a given geographic region , such as the Pacific , or in a given functional area , such as long - range transportation .
But 60 years after Pearl Harbor , the defense of the continental United States is divided among no fewer than five different four - star officers and six organizations .
Most prominent of the organizations is the Joint Forces Command .
For two years , it has operated the military 's standing Joint Task Force for Civil Support -- beefed up since 9/11 -- that assists civilian authorities in the event of a terrorist attack .
Its Norfolk , Va. , headquarters is close enough to Washington to make it easy for its commander and staff to come to the Pentagon for policy meetings , yet is far enough out of the potential blast zone to ensure its safety if the worst were to occur in the capital .
Location and capabilities make " JFCOM " the likely core of a future Northern Command .
But other nodes of Pentagon power would also have to be pulled into the new command .
The U.S. Space Command in Colorado , for instance , would have to be in the mix .
Its chief is responsible for protecting stateside computer systems .
That same officer defends U.S. and Canadian airspace , in his other role as commander in chief of the North American Aerospace Defense Command , or NORAD .
But it 's the CINC of Joint Forces Command who is responsible for defending land and sea .
Except where he is n't :
The commander in chief for the Pacific , who protects Hawaii and Alaska , also hunts drug smugglers off the West Coast ; the Southern Command CINC in Florida does the same along the Gulf Coast and in the Caribbean ; and both of those commanders share their responsibility with the U.S. Coast Guard , which is not even part of the Defense Department , and whose commandant sits in Washington , D.C .
... on the morning of September 11 , when the alarms went off in the Cheyenne Mountain , Colo. , command post of NORAD , the senior officer on duty was not the U.S. chief , but his executive officer , Maj. Gen. Eric Findley --a Canadian . .... since Sept. 11 , the Canadians have invited the United States even deeper into their country .
The centerpiece of this continental collaboration is NORAD .
Deep under Cheyenne Mountain , U.S. and Canadian officers literally sit side by side in North America 's most secure command post .
Their screens display data from U.S. and Canadian radars , and their radios dispatch U.S. and Canadian fighter aircraft , all but interchangeably .
By treaty , NORAD 's commander is always a U.S. officer reporting directly to the President , and the deputy commander is always a Canadian officer reporting directly to the prime minister .
But NORAD also shows the limits of collaboration .
It actually originated as a form of " defense against help . "
In the 1950s , it became clear that U.S. forces would need to intercept any incoming Soviet bombers as far from the United States as possible -- sovereign airspace be damned .
Canadians decided that only a joint headquarters would guarantee them a say in the air war that might rage over their heads .
For the past few years , Canadian nervousness about a proposed U.S. national missile defense , which would probably have its nerve center at the Cheyenne Mountain command post , has prompted speculation that Ottawa would pull out altogether .
Fortunately , NORAD is still standing .
But throughout its history , noted Joseph Jockel , director of Canadian studies at St. Lawrence University , the binational command has had " emergency procedures for the United States to act alone and for Canada to stand down . "
In the event of a disagreement , all of those Canadians in Cheyenne Mountain can be replaced with U.S. personnel .

Mission Creep Hits Home
By William M. Arkin
Los Angeles Times
Sunday 23 November 2003
American armed forces are assuming major new domestic policing and surveillance roles .
Preoccupied with the war in Iraq and still traumatized by Sept. 11 , 2001 , the American public has paid little attention to some of what is being done inside the United States in the name of anti-terrorism .
Under the banner of " homeland security , " the military and intelligence communities are implementing far - reaching changes that blur the lines between terrorism and other kinds of crises and will break down long - established barriers to military action and surveillance within the U.S .
" We must start thinking differently , " says Air Force Gen. Ralph E. " Ed " Eberhart , the newly installed commander of Northern Command , the military 's homeland security arm .
Before 9/11 , he says , the military and intelligence systems were focused on " the away game " and not properly focused on " the home game . "
" Home , " of course , is the United States .
Eberhart 's Colorado - based command is charged with enhancing homeland security in two ways : by improving the military 's capability to defend the country 's borders , coasts and airspace -- unquestionably within the military 's long - established mission -- and by providing " military assistance to civil authorities " when authorized by the secretary of Defense or the president .
That too may sound unexceptionable :
The military has long had mechanisms to respond to a request for help from state governors .
New after 9/11 are more aggressive preparations and the presumption that local government will not be able to carry the new homeland security load .
Being the military , moreover , contingency planners approach preparing by assuming the worst .
All of this is a major -- and potentially dangerous -- departure from past policy .
The U.S. military operates under the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act , which prohibits the direct use of federal troops " to execute the laws " of the United States .
The courts have interpreted this to mean that the military is prohibited from any active role in direct civilian law enforcement , such as search , seizure or arrest of civilians .
" There are abundant reasons for rejecting the further expansion of the military 's domestic role , " says Mackubin T. Owens , a professor of strategy and force planning at the Naval War College .
Looking at the issue historically , Owens wrote in an August 2002 essay in the National Review 's online edition that " the use of soldiers as a posse [ places ] them in the uncomfortable position of taking orders from local authorities who had an interest in the disputes that provoked the unrest in the first place . "
Moreover , Owens said , becoming more involved in domestic policing can be " subtle and subversive … like a lymphoma or termite infestation . "
Though we are far from having " tanks rumbling through the streets , " he said , the potential long - term effect of an increasing military role in police and law enforcement activities is " a military contemptuous of American society and unresponsive to civilian authorities . "
Eberhart says his Northern Command operates scrupulously within the bounds of the law .
" We believe the [ Posse Comitatus ]
Act , as amended , provides the authority we need to do our job , and no modification is needed at this time , " he told the House Armed Services Committee in March .
Of course , what he knows is that amendments approved by Congress in 1996 for that earlier civilian war , the war on drugs , have already expanded the military 's domestic powers so that Washington can act unilaterally in dispatching the military without waiting for a state 's request for help .
Long before 9/11 , Congress authorized the military to assist local law enforcement officials in domestic " drug interdiction " and during terrorist incidents involving weapons of mass destruction .
Furthermore , the president , after proclaiming a state of emergency , can authorize additional actions .
Indeed , the military is presently operating under just such an emergency declaration .
Eberhart 's command has defined three levels of operations , each of which triggers a larger set of authorized activities .
The levels are " extraordinary , " " emergency " and " temporary . "
At the " temporary " level , which covers such things as the Olympic Games or the Super Bowl , limited assistance can be provided to law enforcement agencies when a governor requests it , primarily in such areas as logistics , transportation and communications .
During " emergencies , " the military can provide similar support , mostly in response to specific events such as the attacks on the World Trade Center .
It is only in the case of " extraordinary " domestic operations that the unique capabilities of the Defense Department are deployed .
These include not just such things as air patrols to shoot down hijacked planes or the defusing of bombs and other explosives , , but also bringing in intelligence collectors , special operators and even full combat troops .
Given the absence of terrorist attacks inside the United States since 9/11 , it may seem surprising that Northern Command is already working under the far - reaching authority that goes with " extraordinary operations . "
But it is .
" We are not going to be out there spying on people , " Eberhart told PBS ' NewsHour in September .
But , he said , " We get information from people who do . "
Some of that information increasingly comes not from the FBI or those charged with civilian law enforcement but from a Pentagon organization established last year , the Counterintelligence Field Activity ( CIFA ) .
The seemingly innocuous CIFA was originally given the mission of protecting the Defense Department and its personnel , as well as " critical infrastructure , " against espionage conducted by terrorists and foreign intelligence services .
But in August , Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld expanded CIFA 's mission , charging it with maintaining " a domestic law enforcement database that includes information related to potential terrorist threats directed against the Department of Defense . "
The group 's Assessments and Technology Directorate , which shares offices with the Justice Department 's Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force , has already identified 200 foreign terrorist suspects in the U.S. , according to a Defense Department report to Congress .
This year , the Pentagon inspector general authorized assigning military special agents to 56 FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force operations at FBI field offices .
These military agents will pursue leads in local communities of potential threats to the military .
Eberhart also plans to have his own cadre of agents working with local law enforcement .
Next year , he plans to transform Joint Task Force Six , a drug interdiction unit of 160 military personnel at Ft. Bliss , Texas , into Joint Interagency Task Force North .
The new task force will be given nationwide responsibility for working with law enforcement agencies .
CIFA , moreover , has been given a domestic " data mining " mission : figuring out a way to process massive sets of public records , intercepted communications , credit card accounts , etc. , to find " actionable intelligence . "
" Homeland defense relies on the sharing of actionable intelligence among the appropriate federal , state , and local agencies , " says Lt. Gen. Edward G. Anderson III , Eberhart 's deputy .
Another ambitious domestic project is being undertaken by the National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency , which is gathering " geospatial information " about 133 cities , the borders and seaports .
This " urban data inventory " combines unclassified and classified data ( including such things as the location of emergency services , communications , transportation and food supplies ) with a high - resolution satellite map of the United States .
When the mapping efforts are completed , a national " spatial data infrastructure " will be created down to the house level .
Intelligence analysts speak of one day being able to identify individual occupants , as well as their national background and political affiliations .
Though the military is just getting its systems in place , there can be no other conclusion : Domestic surveillance is back .
It 's not that we 're heading toward martial law .
We 're not .
But outside the view of most of the public , the government is daily expanding military operations into areas of local government and law enforcement that historically have been off - limits .
And it does n't seem far - fetched to imagine that those charged with assembling " actionable intelligence " will slowly start combining databases of known terrorists with seemingly innocuous lists of contributors to charities or causes , that membership lists for activist organizations will be folded in , that names and personal data of anti-globalization protesters will be run through the " data mine . "
After all , the mission of Northern Command and other Pentagon agencies is to identify groups and individuals who could potentially pose threats to Defense Department and civilian installations .
Given all this , it might be a good time for state and local governments to ask themselves whether the federal government , through the military , is slowly eroding their power to manage what -- for very good reasons -- have always been considered local responsibilities .

It 's really scary listening to Bush 's invasion general and war criminal , Tommy Franks , predict the future .
According to Franks , the Constitution is doomed and a military dictatorship is all but inevitable in the United States .
In the December [ 2003 ] issue of Cigar Aficionado (! ) , Franks says if terrorists use WMD in America , " the Western world , the free world , loses what it cherishes most , and that is freedom and liberty we 've seen for a couple of hundred years in this grand experiment that we call democracy . "
According to Franks , the people themselves would demand the Constitution be revoked after such an event .
" It means the potential of a weapon of mass destruction and a terrorist , massive , casualty - producing event somewhere in the Western world -- it may be in the United States of America -- that causes our population to question our own Constitution and to begin to militarize our country in order to avoid a repeat of another mass , casualty - producing event .
Which in fact , then begins to unravel the fabric of our Constitution .
Two steps , very , very important . "
The way the rightwing nut jobs over at NewsMax phrased it , trashing the Constitution and the Bill of Rights is not so much a matter of IF , but WHEN .
" Franks did n't speculate about how soon such an event might take place , " NewsMax wrote .
" Already , critics of the U.S. Patriot Act , rushed through Congress in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks , have argued that the law aims to curtail civil liberties and sets a dangerous precedent ...
But Franks ' scenario goes much further .
He is the first high - ranking official to openly speculate that the Constitution could be scrapped in favor of a military form of government . "
Well , maybe not the first , since Dubya himself has used the " D " word on several occasions .
" You do n't get everything you want , " Bush told Governing Magazine back in 1998 when he was gov of Texas .
" A dictatorship would be a lot easier . "
" If this were a dictatorship , it would be a heck of a lot easier , just so long as I'm the dictator , " Bush told CNN in December , 2000 .
" A dictatorship would be a heck of a lot easier , there 's no question about it , " the appointed one told Business Week on July 30 , 2001 .
I know , he was just kidding ... or was he ?

General Tommy Franks calls for Repeal of US Constitution

Commentary on General Franks ' Statement
The Criminalization of the State
by Michel Chossudovsky
23 November 2003
In the wake of the Iraq war , 18 Iraqis and 2 Jordanians introduced a class action law suit in a Brussels Court against General Franks , Commander of the US Armed Forces in Iraq .
Based on the law of “ universal jurisdiction ” , characteristic of Belgian law concerning genocide and war crimes , General Franks was identified :
" for ordering war crimes and for not preventing others from committing them or for providing protection to the perpetrators . "
The law suit does not solely implicate General Franks , who was obeying orders from higher up :
Under the war agenda , high ranking officials of the Bush administration , members of the military , the US Congress and the Judiciary have been granted the authority not only to commit criminal acts , but also to designate those opposed to these criminal acts as " enemies of the State . "
In other words , the " Criminalization of the State " , is when war criminals legitimately occupy positions of authority , which enable them to decide " who are the criminals " , when in fact they are criminals .
Franks ' statement no doubt reflects a consensus within the Military as to how events ought to unfold .
It is clear in his mind that the " war on terrorism " provides a justification for repealing the Rule of Law , ultimately with a view to preserving civil liberties .
Franks ' interview suggests that an Al Qaeda sponsored terrorist attack will be used as a " trigger mechanism " for a military coup d'état in America .
Franks is alluding to a so - called " Pearl Harbor type event " which would be used as a justification for declaring a State of emergency , leading to the establishment of a military government .
In many regards , the militarisation of civilian State institutions is already functional under the facade of a bogus democracy .
General Franks has nonetheless identified with cynical accuracy the precise scenario whereby military rule will be established :
" a terrorist , massive , casualty - producing event [ will occur ] somewhere in the Western world – it may be in the United States of America – that causes our population to question our own Constitution and to begin to militarize our country in order to avoid a repeat of another mass , casualty - producing event . "
This statement from an individual who was actively involved in military and intelligence planning at the highest levels , suggests that the " militarisation of our country " is an ongoing operational assumption .
It is part of the broader " Washington consensus " .
It identifies the Bush administration 's " roadmap " of war and Homeland Defense .
Needless to say , it is also an integral part of the neoliberal agenda .
The " terrorist massive casualty - producing event " is presented by General Franks as a crucial political turning point .
The resulting crisis and social turmoil are intended to facilitate a major shift in US political , social and institutional structures .
In the words of David Rockefeller :
" We are on the verge of global transformation .
All we need is the right major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order . "
A similar statement was made by Zbigniew Brzezinski in the Grand Chessboard :
" As America becomes an increasingly multicultural society , it may find it more difficult to fashion a consensus on foreign policy issues , except in the circumstances of a truly massive and widely perceived direct external threat . "
The NeoCons ' Project for the New American Century ( PNAC ) , published in September 2000 , barely two months before the presidential elections , called for :
" some catastrophic and catalyzing event , like a new Pearl Harbor . "
( See http://www.globalresearch.ca/articles/NAC304A.html )
What is terrifying in General Franks ' statement is that it accurately reflects official US foreign policy .
It comes from a man who obeys orders emanating from the military command structure .
In other words , his statement accurately reveals the Pentagon 's frame of mind .
Moreover , it comes from a military man who speaks with a profound sense of conviction , who firmly believes in the righteousness of war as a means to safeguarding democratic values .
In other words , the military actors and politicians are totally blinded by the " war on terrorism " dogma .
Truth is falsehood and falsehood is truth .
Realities are turned upside down .
Acts of war are heralded as " humanitarian interventions " geared towards upholding democracy .
Military occupation and the killing of civilians are presented as " peace - keeping operations . "
The repeal of democracy is portrayed by General Franks as a means to providing " domestic security " and upholding civil liberties .
Needless to say : any attempt by antiwar critics to reveal these " inconsistencies " or " unanswered questions " would -- under General Frank 's scenario -- be defined as a " criminal act " .
In other words , those who are investigating " the war on terrorism " and the military , political and economic actors behind the New World Order , with a view to establishing the truth , are categorized as " enemies of the State " , and consequently as criminals :
" The ' war on terrorism ' is the cover for the war on dissent . "

Gen . Franks Doubts Constitution Will Survive WMD Attack
by John O. Edwards
NewsMax.com 21 November 2003
www.globalresearch.ca 23 November 2003
Gen .
Tommy Franks says that if the United States is hit with a weapon of mass destruction that inflicts large casualties , the Constitution will likely be discarded in favor of a military form of government .
Franks , who successfully led the U.S. military operation to liberate Iraq , expressed his worries in an extensive interview he gave to the men ’s lifestyle magazine Cigar Aficionado .
In the magazine ’s December edition , the former commander of the military ’s Central Command warned that if terrorists succeeded in using a weapon of mass destruction ( WMD ) against the U.S. or one of our allies , it would likely have catastrophic consequences for our cherished republican form of government .
Discussing the hypothetical dangers posed to the U.S. in the wake of Sept. 11 , Franks said that “ the worst thing that could happen ” is if terrorists acquire and then use a biological , chemical or nuclear weapon that inflicts heavy casualties .
If that happens , Franks said , “ ... the Western world , the free world , loses what it cherishes most , and that is freedom and liberty we ’ve seen for a couple of hundred years in this grand experiment that we call democracy . ”
Franks then offered “ in a practical sense ” what he thinks would happen in the aftermath of such an attack .
“ It means the potential of a weapon of mass destruction and a terrorist , massive , casualty - producing event somewhere in the Western world – it may be in the United States of America – that causes our population to question our own Constitution and to begin to militarize our country in order to avoid a repeat of another mass , casualty - producing event .
Which in fact , then begins to unravel the fabric of our Constitution .
Two steps , very , very important . ”
Franks did n’t speculate about how soon such an event might take place .
Already , critics of the U.S. Patriot Act , rushed through Congress in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks , have argued that the law aims to curtail civil liberties and sets a dangerous precedent .
But Franks ’ scenario goes much further .
He is the first high - ranking official to openly speculate that the Constitution could be scrapped in favor of a military form of government .
The usually camera - shy Franks retired from U.S. Central Command , known in Pentagon lingo as CentCom , in August 2003 , after serving nearly four decades in the Army .
Franks earned three Purple Hearts for combat wounds and three Bronze Stars for valor .
Known as a “ soldier ’s general , ” Franks made his mark as a top commander during the U.S. ’s successful Operation Desert Storm , which liberated Kuwait in 1991 .
He was in charge of CentCom when Osama bin Laden ’s al - Qaeda attacked the United States on Sept. 11 .
Franks said that within hours of the attacks , he was given orders to prepare to root out the Taliban in Afghanistan and to capture bin Laden .
Franks offered his assessment on a number of topics to Cigar Aficionado , including :
President Bush : “ As I look at President Bush , I think he will ultimately be judged as a man of extremely high character .
A very thoughtful man , not having been appraised properly by those who would say he ’s not very smart .
I find the contrary .
I think he ’s very , very bright .
And I suspect that he ’ll be judged as a man who led this country through a crease in history effectively .
Probably we ’ll think of him in years to come as an American hero . ”
On the motivation for the Iraq war : Contrary to claims that top Pentagon brass opposed the invasion of Iraq , Franks said he wholeheartedly agreed with the president ’s decision to invade Iraq and oust Saddam Hussein .
“ I , for one , begin with intent .
...
There is no question that Saddam Hussein had intent to do harm to the Western alliance and to the United States of America .
That intent is confirmed in a great many of his speeches , his commentary , the words that have come out of the Iraqi regime over the last dozen or so years .
So we have intent .
“ If we know for sure ... that a regime has intent to do harm to this country , and if we have something beyond a reasonable doubt that this particular regime may have the wherewithal with which to execute the intent , what are our actions and orders as leaders in this country ? ”
The Pentagon ’s deck of cards : Asked how the Pentagon decided to put its most - wanted Iraqis on a set of playing cards , Franks explained its genesis .
He recalled that when his staff identified the most notorious Iraqis the U.S. wanted to capture , “ it just turned out that the number happened to be about the same as a deck of cards .
And so somebody said , ‘ Aha , this will be the ace of spades . ’ ”
Capturing Saddam : Franks said he was not surprised that Saddam has not been captured or killed .
But he says he will eventually be found , perhaps sooner than Osama bin laden .
“ The capture or killing of Saddam Hussein will be a near term thing .
And I wo n’t say that ’ll be within 19 or 43 days .
... I believe it is inevitable . ”
Franks ended his interview with a less - than - optimistic note .
“ It ’s not in the history of civilization for peace ever to reign .
Never has in the history of man .
... I doubt that we ’ll ever have a time when the world will actually be at peace . ”

The war on terror and American democracy
some ominous warnings
By Patrick Martin
27 November 2003
Three commentaries published recently in the US media , all by well - connected observers of the US military , have suggested that a major new terrorist attack within the United States could disrupt the 2004 elections and even result in military intervention on the streets of America as well as the suspension of the Constitution .
On Friday , November 21 , the right - wing web news service Newsmax.com published an account of the interview given by General Tommy Franks to the lifestyle magazine Cigar Aficionado .
Franks said that a terrorist attack employing a weapon of mass destruction and causing mass casualties , either in the United States or against an ally , would likely result in replacing the American Constitution with a military government .
As the commander of CentCom , Franks led US forces in the conquest of Afghanistan in 2001 and the invasion of Iraq earlier this year , before retiring during the summer .
In his magazine interview , he outlined this scenario :
It means the potential of a weapon of mass destruction and a terrorist , massive , casualty - producing event somewhere in the Western world - it may be in the United States of America - that causes our population to question our own Constitution and to begin to militarize our country in order to avoid a repeat of another mass , casualty - producing event .
Which in fact , then begins to unravel the fabric of our Constitution .
Two steps , very , very important .
Franks remains a fervent supporter of the Bush administration , describing Bush as a very thoughtful man , and declaring , Probably well think of him in years to come as an American hero .
But according to Franks , it may be under the administration of this hero that the Western world , the free world , loses what it cherishes most , and that is freedom and liberty weve seen for a couple of hundred years in this grand experiment that we call democracy .
The retired general placed the responsibility for this possible turn to dictatorship on our population , and was silent on what role the military leadership or the Bush administration would play in its establishment .
The American media has apparently failed to ask him anything about it since .
Terrorism and the 2004 election
The same theme was touched on in the Outlook section of the Washington Post , the main daily newspaper in the US capital , in a column published Sunday , November 23 , under the headlineTerrorist Logic : Disrupt the 2004 Election .
The author was David J. Rothkopf , a former Clinton administration official now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , a major Washington think tank .
Rothkopf outlines the possibility of a terrorist campaign of suicide bombings during next falls election campaign that leads to a full - scale military mobilization .
History suggests that striking during major elections is an effective tool for terrorist groups , he writes .
As a representative of the Democratic wing of the ruling elite , Rothkopf is clearly concerned that such an event would profit the Bush administration .
He cites examples such as the Israeli elections in 1996 , when suicide bombings contributed to the victory of right - wing Likud candidate Binyamin Netanyahu , and the 2000 Russian elections , won by Vladimir Putin after a series of bombings in Moscow and other cities attributed to Chechen terrorists but widely believed to have been carried out or at least permitted by Putin's KGB .
Rothkopf notes the politically symbiotic relationship between the terrorists and the hard - liners : Hard - liners strike back more broadly , making it easier for terrorists as they attempt to justify their causes and their methods .
He could have added that the terrorists are a godsend for the hard - liners , providing a pretext for dictatorial methods .
More important than his argumentessentially restating the Democratic appeal for a more coordinated international approach to terrorism is what Rothkopf reveals about the expectations in official Washington and corporate America .
At one point he notes :
Recently , I co-chaired a meeting hosted by CNBC of more than 200 senior business and government executives , many of whom are specialists in security and terrorism related issues .
Almost three - quarters of them said it was likely the United States would see a major terrorist strike before the end of 2004 .
A similar number predicted that the assault would be greater than those of 9/11 and might well involve weapons of mass destruction .
It was the sense of the group that such an attack was likely to generate additional support for President Bush .
This is a remarkable assertion .
Rothkopf describes this elite audience as serious people , not prone to hysteria or panicmilitary officers , policymakers , scientists , researchers and others who have studied such issues for a long time .
The vast majority of them , he says , believe that a terrorist attack worse than September 11 that is , killing thousands or even tens of thousands of Americanswill take place in the course of the 2004 election campaign , and that this attack will benefit the political fortunes of George W. Bush .
Military action inside the US
The role of the military in domestic policing was the subject of a column published November 23 , written by William Arkin , a well - connected military analyst for the Los Angeles Times .
It was Arkin who last year revealed the Bush administrations decision to revise US military strategy to target seven countries - Iraq , Iran , North Korea , Libya , Syria , China and Russia - for possible nuclear attack .
The column was headlined , Mission Creep Hits Home , American armed forces are assuming major new domestic policing and surveillance roles .
It examines the role of the Pentagons Northern Command , the newly established center for controlling all US armed forces within the continental US , Canada and Alaska , and includes an interview with its commander , Air Force General Ralph E. Eberhart .
According to Arkin , the Northern Command has defined three categories of operations , with increasing levels of activity : temporary , emergency and extraordinary .
He writes :
It is only in the case of extraordinary domestic operations that the unique capabilities of the Defense Department are deployed .
These include not just such things as air patrols to shoot down hijacked planes or the defusing of bombs and other explosives , but also bringing in intelligence collectors , special operators and even full combat troops .
Arkin reveals that the Northern Command is already working under the far - reaching authority that goes with extraordinary operations .
This includes the activation of a series of intelligence - gathering operations directed against the American people .
These include :
* A decision by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to expand the mission of the Counterintelligence Field Activity ( CIFA ) , established last year to protect critical infrastructure , authorizing it to maintain a domestic law enforcement database that includes information related to potential terrorist threats directed against the Department of Defense .
* The assigning of military special agents to 56 FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force operations at FBI field offices , investigating potential threats to the military in local communities inside the United States .
* The decision by Eberhart to transform Joint Task Force Six , a drug - enforcement unit of 160 soldiers at Ft. Bliss , Texas , into a counterterrorism force called Interagency Task Force North .
Congress originally authorized joint Task Force Six in 1996 , in the first exception to the Posse Comitatus Law , which bars the US military from assuming domestic police functions .
* The National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency , another little - known body , is gathering an urban data inventory combining unclassified and classified data on 133 cities , as well as US border crossings and seaports , to create a national spatial data infrastructure .
This information , which Arkin describes as down to the house level , could be used either for surveillance or military targeting .
According to Arkin , the CIFA has been given a domestic data mining mission as well : figuring out a way to process massive sets of public records , intercepted communications , credit card accounts , etc. , to find actionable intelligence .
This amounts to reviving in another form the Total Information Awareness program , headed by Admiral John Poindexter of Iran - Contra fame , which was supposedly shut down earlier this year by Congress after a public outcry .
Arkin concludes :
Outside the view of most of the public , the government is daily expanding military operations into areas of local government and law enforcement that historically have been off - limits .
And it doesnt seem far - fetched to imagine that those charged with assembling actionable intelligence will slowly start combining databases of known terrorists with seemingly innocuous lists of contributors to charities or causes , that membership lists for activist organizations will be folded in , that names and personal data of anti-globalization protesters will be run through the data mine .
After all , the mission of Northern Command and other Pentagon agencies is to identify groups and individuals who could potentially pose threats to Defense Department and civilian installations .
Here , then , is a glimpse of the real state of affairs in the United States on the eve of the 2004 election year .
Ruling circles widely anticipate a massive terrorist strike that would boost the flagging political standing of the Bush administration or even lead to a suspension of the elections and the establishment of military rule .
The US military is actively preparing for this possibility by readying troops for use in domestic policing and by assembling a database of likely political opponents .
The obvious question is : given the expected consequences , is it not in the political interests of the Bush administration or sections of the military / intelligence apparatus to engineer such a terrorist attack ?
Or at least to insure that it takes place , by looking the other way , on the model of September 11 ?
PubSub , the short name for “ Publish - Subscribe ” , is an XMPP technology , bringing instant or “ real - time ” publication , notification and distribution of content to the internet .
The PubSub technology is quite exhaustively described in this specification : XEP - 0060 : Publish - Subscribe .
PubSub enables a user or machine to publish information in a tree - organized structure , much like a web server would do with static content ( folders and HTML files ) .
PubSub instantly sends notifications ( only meta - data ) or the full content ( which we name “ payload ” ) to all the subscribers .
XMPP users ( machines or humans ) can subscribe to these nodes , and receive instant updates .
This general broadcast mechanism is an instant Push technology , enabling a PubSub server to send only what is necessary , as soon as it has updates .
Push avoids the ( too ) widely - used polling technique and its drawbacks : updates lag and server overload .
The most known example is RSS : myriads of RSS clients constantly poll an RSS feed , most of the time for nothing , because there is no update .
The first draft of the PubSub specification has been published a few years ago ( 2003 ) , and has been widely peer reviewed since .
Although we have had few implementations in the recent years , we now have seen real - world examples of this technology silently appear on the internet .
Here is a short and non-exhaustive review :
WordPress : WordPress.com is a massive blog hosting website , based on the free / opensource blog engine ( WordPress.org ) .
WordPress.com is using PubSub at im.wordpress.com , each blog and comment is instantly published on PubSub , and these contents instantly sent to the subscribers .
BBC : BBC is the well known british TV and radio broadcasting company , respected for the quality of their programs .
BBC is broadcasting the TV and radio programs to all the users by using PubSub .
Apple : Apple , the computer , phone and software maker , has put up an infrastructure and API that enables applications ( E - mail , chat , etc. ) to send notifications to iPhones .
Seesmic : Seesmic is a video - based social network .
They use PubSub as a real - time message notifier service , for users and peers .
Yahoo ! : FireEagle is a Yahoo !
service for user geolocation sharing , using also OAuth .
PubSub is here used to broadcast geolocation to users and third party applications .
Notifixious : Superfeedr is a real - time bloggosphere notifications service .
Superfeedr is a real - time feed fetching and parsing infrastructure .
PubSub is the core or realt - ime content distribution .
Identica : the opensource web site for federated microblogging , based on the OpenMicroBlogging specification , is using Laconica .
PubSub is used here as the message broker , along with ATOM .
WordPress , BBC , SuperFeedr are all using ejabberd ’s mod_pubsub , which will gain improvements on the soon - to - be - released ejabberd 2.1 .
The PubSub technology is arising , slowly , but surely , as businesses understand and leverage their core activity with PubSub ’s intrinsic advantages .
Expect more innovative projects to come to life in the coming months …

Stay tuned .
This article is adapted from chapter one of Freedom , Property , and Society : Essays in Honor of Hans - Hermann Hoppe , edited by Guido Hlsmann and Stephan Kinsella .
My first full exposure to the brilliance of Hans - Hermann Hoppe came at an early Mises University in which he gave the main lecture on methodology .
Here he offered a new take on Mises ’s Kantian method .
Hoppe explained Kant ’s typology of propositions , and showed how Mises had appropriated them but with a new twist .
Instead of categories of thinking and categories of the mind , Mises went further than Kant to delineate categories of action , which is the foundation of economic reasoning .
In this lecture , we all discovered something about Mises we had not known , something bigger and grander than we knew , and it caused us to think differently about a subject that we thought we knew well .
This same Hoppean effect — that sense of having been profoundly enlightened by a completely new way of understanding something — has happened many times over the years .
He has made contributions to ethics , to international political economy , to the theory of the origin of the state , to comparative systems , to culture and its economic relation , to anthropology and the theory and practice of war .
Even on a subject that everyone thinks about but no one really seems to understand — the system of democracy — he clarified matters in a way that helps you see the functioning of the world in a completely new light .

There are n’t that many thinkers who have this kind of effect .
Mises was one .
Rothbard was another .
Hoppe certainly fits in that line .
He is the kind of thinker who reminds you that ideas are real things that shape how we understand the world around us .
I dare say that no one can read works like Democracy —
The God that Failed , A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism , and The Economics and Ethics of Private Property and come away unchanged .
Often times when you first hear a point he makes , you resist it .
I recall when he spoke at a conference we held on American history , and gave a paper on the U.S. Constitution .
You might not think that a German economist could add anything to our knowledge on this topic .
He argued that it represented a vast increase in government power and that this was its true purpose .
It created a powerful central government , with the cover of liberty as an excuse .
He used it as a case in point , and went further to argue that all constitutions are of the same type .
In the name of limiting government — which they purportedly do — they invariably appear in periods of history when the elites are regrouping to emerge from what they consider to be near anarchy .
The Constitution , then , represents the assertion of power .

When he finished , you could hear a pin drop .
I ’m not sure that anyone was instantly persuaded .
He had challenged everything we thought we knew about ourselves .
The applause was polite , but not enthusiastic .
Yet his points stuck .
Over time , I think all of us there travelled some intellectual distance .
The Constitution was preceded by the Articles of Confederation , which Rothbard had described as near anarchist in effect .
Who were these guys who cobbled together this Constitution ?
They were the leftovers from the war : military leaders , financiers , and other mucky mucks — a very different crew from the people who signed the Declaration of Independence .
Jefferson was out of the country when the Constitution was passed .
And what was the effect of the Constitution ?
To restrain government ?
No .
It was precisely the opposite , just as Hoppe said .
It created a new and more powerful government that not only failed to restrain itself ( what government has ever done that ? ) , but grew and grew into the monstrosity we have today .
It required a wholesale rethinking of the history , but what Hoppe had said that shocked everyone turns out to be precisely right — and this is only one example among many .

I ’m speaking for multitudes when I say that he helped me understand democracy as a form of nationalization of the citizenry .
We all became the government : or , we all became public property .
And what happens to public property ?
It is overutilized and wasted because it is unowned by any one person or group of people in particular .
Thus did the citizens become war fodder .
We are taxed without limit .
We have no way to restrain the state since no one in particular is made responsible for our plight .
Our leaders are mere managers — not owners , like the monarchs — who are encouraged to loot and leave .
They are there as covers for the real state , which is a faceless apparatus that is permanent and cares nothing for the value of the commonwealth .
He contrasted this with monarchy , not because he favors monarchy but rather to help us understand .
The monarch is the owner .
He has the incentive to preserve value .
He can hand it on to an heir .
Heirs were raised and trained for governance , and in turn to hand it on to their heirs .
So we might expect them to be relatively more civilized as compared with democratic rulers .
The Economics and Ethi ...
Hoppe , Hans - Hermann Best Price : $ 42.48 Buy New $ 564.15 ( as of 07:55 EST - Details )
History bears this out .
Hoppe dates the onset of modern democracy to World War I and following , and he has scandalized many by calling the U.S. , the Soviet Union , and Nazi Germany all democracies , but he means this in his special sense : the people neither own themselves nor are owned by anyone .
The citizens are public property and are said to all participate in their own governance understood as an elected executive state .
This was a modern form of government that displaced the old form — and it goes a long way towards explaining the advent of total war and the total state .
There are many other issues for which he has done this — his Economics and Ethics of Private Property helped people to imagine society without a state as never before .
On the issue of immigration , he showed how modern states use immigration as a means of state expansion .
He has taken on the issue of property covenants and their relationship to private property .
There is so much more .
We have all suspected for some time that this will culminate in a sweeping treatment of socio- economics , an integrated master treatise along the lines of the great books of Austrians past .
Its time is coming .
Hoppe is an original thinker , but he is glad to grant his debts to Mises , to Rothbard , to Eric von Kuehnelt - Leddihn , and to the post - modernists of his German education .
He stands on the shoulders of giants , and has reached beyond them , as Murray often acknowledged .
There are n’t many thinkers we can name who have been so generous with their insights , and given so much to help us understand the world around us more clearly .
Let me finally mention that Hans has something else in common with his predecessors .
He is a man of courage and conviction .
He had plenty of opportunities to sell out for preferment ’s sake , but he has stayed the course , committed to truth and to freedom and to the free marketplace of ideas .
He is a tough and relentless fighter that we can all admire .
He fears no truth .
All this is why I can confidently predict that he will always emerge from battle as a champion .

Managers mull options after moon mission malfunction
BY STEPHEN CLARK
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : August 25 , 2009
Officials are hurriedly looking for ways to save fuel on NASA 's $ 79 million lunar impactor mission after a crisis Saturday caused the spacecraft to burn more than half of its remaining propellant .
The Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite used about 140 kilograms , or 309 pounds , of maneuvering fuel to maintain the probe 's orientation in space Saturday , according to Dan Andrews , the mission 's project manager at Ames Research Center .
LCROSS is tugging a 41 - foot - long Centaur rocket stage on a circuitous route through space .
Scientists are preparing for a fleeting series of observations as the spent booster is released for a suicidal plunge into the moon on Oct.
9 . The goal is to hit a shadowed crater near the lunar south pole to see if water ice deposits reside there .
The 6 - foot - tall shepherding spacecraft 's attitude control system was specifically designed to handle the unusual job of positioning the 47 - foot - long stack as it flies toward the moon .
" It was a tough day , as you can imagine , " Andrews said .
" But what it 's done is given us a razor 's focus on how to manage the remainder of the propellant . "
LCROSS is now perilously close to its built - in propellant margins , and Andrews said the team will probably have to cancel some activities that are not crucial to the mission .
" Our estimates now are if we pretty much baseline the mission , meaning just accomplish the things that we have to ( do ) to get the job done with full mission success , we 're still in the black on propellant , but not by a lot , " Andrews told Spaceflight Now late Tuesday .
LCROSS now has between 20 pounds and 40 pounds of extra propellant that could be used in unplanned activities , a relatively thin margin for satellite operations .
" We can finish this mission , but it makes our sensitivity to something happening quite high , " Andrews said .
The anomaly occurred out of view of ground stations , so LCROSS engineers were not aware of the problem until an antenna acquired the spacecraft later Saturday morning .
" When we acquired the signal , we discovered that the thrusters had been very busy and that the propellant in the tank was reduced quite a bit , " Andrews said .
After regaining contact with LCROSS , controllers traced the fault to the Inertial Reference Unit , a sensor that measures the craft 's attitude .
Software on the satellite detected the issue and automatically switched attitude determination to the star tracker system as designed .
" Those star tracker rates are inherently noisier , but they were noisier than we had anticipated , " Andrews said .
Thrusters struggled to keep the six - sided spacecraft pointed in the right direction , but data from the star tracker caused the control system to use a substantial amount of fuel .
" Our system was working very hard to keep up with them , and in doing so was expending a lot of propellant .
And because we were out of view , we could n't do anything about it , " Andrews said .
Engineers recovered the IRU and reduced propellant usage back to normal levels , according to Andrews .
" We stopped the bleeding pretty quickly , " Andrews said .
When the anomaly occurred , LCROSS was turning the Centaur around to warm up the rocket to evacuate water ice carried into space .
Officials want to get rid of the trapped water to ensure the accuracy of navigation and science results .
NASA is now working with the suppliers of the reference unit and star tracker assembly to find the root cause of the problem , the agency said in a statement .
In the meantime , controllers have changed the satellite 's software logic to decrease its sensitivity to similar events .
" For example , if we find that the spacecraft is inclined to do a bunch of thruster firing activity , or if we notice one of the key avionics elements failed , we would rather go into a free drift than expend a bunch of propellant and seal our fate , " Andrews said .
NASA recognizes LCROSS as a risk - tolerant mission , meaning the project has a " moderate chance " of not achieving success .
" We 've made our spacecraft very simple , " Andrews said .
" What that did is it allowed us to fit into an incredibly tight cost and schedule box . "
Like so many of the Internet protocols invented decades ago , the Domain Name
System has some serious security issues .
Earlier this week in Stockholm , the Internet Society ( ISOC ) , the Internet Engineering Task Force , and DNS experts provided a status update on DNSSEC , the secure DNS protocol designed to close a security hole in the bowels of the Internet that has been the target of exploits .
The IETF is having its summer meeting in Stockholm this week , graciously sponsored by .SE , the people in charge of the Swedish .se top level domain ( TLD ) .
That domain was one of the first TLDs in the world to deploy DNSSEC , so the stars aligned for the ISOC to steal a lunch hour on Tuesday during the busy IETF week to tell the community about the status of DNSSEC .
DNSSEC is the secure form of the Domain Name System , which has been plagued by security issues in recent years .
We got to hear from DNS expert Olaf Kolkman ( who also happens to chair the Internet Architecture Board , IAB ) who proposed to " grow us a chicken " to get around the chicken - egg problem of implementing DNSSEC .
After all , why would domain owners implement DNSSEC if ISPs and applications do n't heed the extra security options , or would ISPs deploy security - aware DNS servers if domain owners do n't publish secure information ?
Later in the discussion the chicken - egg analogy would be extended in various ways , not the least of which involved breaking the wings of the poor chick , but Kolkman ended with the picture of a proud rooster .
Much as it has with IPv6 , the IETF has been working on the DNS security problem for more than a decade in the form of DNSSEC .
However , there were some false starts , and only recently has DNSSEC starting to be deployed in the Internet 's DNS infrastructure .
Patrick Wallstr ?m of .SE and Jim Galvin of the Public Interest Registry explained how they had implemented DNSSEC in the .se and .org domains , respectively .
In Sweden , the demand for secure DNS delegation surged when the extra fee was dropped , and around the same time , the Kaminsky exploit came out .
.org is still in the " friend and family " period but expects to launch production DNSSEC in 2010 .
. net will follow in late 2010 and .com in early 2011 , according to Matt Larson of Verisign .
The Domain Name System ( DNS ) that translates domain names into IP addresses has long been a favorite attack vector for those looking to separate unsuspecting Internet users from their data or money .
Some years ago it was laughably simple to inject incorrect information in the DNS servers used by regular end -users to find the addresses belonging to the websites they want to visit .
( Usually their ISP 's nameservers . )
Knowing that on an abstract level is one thing , but suddenly seeing porn banners decorate otherwise clean - cut websites made me much more aware of the issue several years ago .
Since then , these so - called cache poisoning attacks have been made much harder , but then Dan Kaminsky came along and showed that the DNS security model is fundamentally flawed .
( Kaminsky has a one - hour slot under the title " undisclosed topic — you will be amazed " during next month 's open - air technology and security conference HAR2009 .
That can't be good . )
So how does DNSSEC protect unsuspecting users against unwanted porn banners or worse if a top - level domain enables DNSSEC and " gets signed ? "
First a quick DNS refresher .
The DNS is a big distributed database , where everyone manages his or her own data .
All this disparate information is tied together through a hierarchical naming and delegation structure .
All of this begins at the " root , " which is managed by the Internet Corporation for Names and Numbers ( ICANN ) .
In the root " zone " there are delegations to the different top level domains , such as .gr , .us , .org , and .com .
Each of these in turn delegates authority over domains such as ietf.org or arstechnica.com to the respective domain holders .
Those in turn populate their DNS servers with addresses .
When a zone such as .org is signed , it means that it can provide cryptographic assurances about how a zone further down in the hierarchy is delegated .
So if someone were to inject false information about ietf.org into random nameservers around the world , these servers can request the new DNS records that contain the cryptographic signatures from .org , and reject anything that does n't check out .
So how does a DNS server know that the .org info is legit ?
A TLD zone would have to be authorized by the next higher level in the hierarchy , which is the root .
However , the root is n't signed at this point .
This means that anyone who wants to perform DNSSEC verification today , needs to install trust anchors for every signed zone in their DNS server .
This gets tedious fast , as there is no standard way to get this information out .
So Swedish ISPs perform validation for .se domains , but not necessarily for any other TLDs .
Fortunately , it looks like the root will be signed before the end of the year , so only a single trust anchor that points towards the DNS root will be necessary from then on .
At that point , it becomes relatively easy for Internet service providers to start validating DNS information for domains under all TLDs and reject fraudulent information — if the domain is signed , at least .
The final step is for operating systems or even applications to implement DNSSEC and perform validation locally , making the entire chain from the root to the application secure .

Supporters of Manuel Zelaya continue to demonstrate in Tegulcigalpa
The Supreme Court of Honduras has rejected a demand by the Organization of American States to reinstate the ousted President , Manuel Zelaya .
OAS chief Jose Miguel Insulza was told the court 's position was " irreversible " when he met its president for two hours in the capital Tegulcigalpa .
Mr Insulza , in Honduras on a mission to have Mr Zelaya reinstated , said he had detected no will to bring him back .
Troops forced President Zelaya out of the country on Sunday .
[ OAS chief Jose Miguel Insulza ] can negotiate all he wants , except for Zelaya 's situation
Enrique Ortez
Honduran interim foreign minister
The interim government formed after his removal says Mr Zelaya 's attempts to change the Honduran constitution , and possibly extend his power , justified the army 's actions .
It can now expect diplomatic isolation and likely international sanctions , the BBC's Stephen Gibbs reports from Tegulcigalpa .
The OAS is expected to meet on Saturday to formally suspend the membership of Honduras .
Mr Zelaya is expected to return from exile to the country on Sunday , accompanied by OAS officials and Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner .
The new Honduran government says he will be arrested .
' Despotic ambitions ' Danilo Izaguirre , spokesman for the supreme court , confirmed that it had rejected the OAS secretary general 's demand .
Miguel Insulza says he faces a difficult task in the Central American state " Insulza asked Honduras to reinstate Zelaya but the president of the court [ Jorge Rivera ] categorically answered that there is an arrest warrant for him , " he said .
" Now the OAS has to decide what it will do . "
Speaking to reporters , the OAS chief said : " We wanted to ask that this situation [ Mr Zelaya 's removal ] be reversed .
Unfortunately , one must say that there appears to be no willingness to do this . "
Ending his visit to Honduras , he said the change of government last week had unequivocally been a " military coup " .
Mr Zelaya had wanted to hold a vote on convening a constitutional convention - a move that could have removed the current one - term limit for presidents .
Instead troops - backed by Congress and the courts - took him from the presidential palace and put him on a plane to Costa Rica .
The new leadership enjoys the support of a substantial proportion of the population and says it stands for democracy , our correspondent reports .
It suggests that Mr Zelaya had despotic ambitions , and therefore the extreme action of removing him from power was justified .
But governments around the world disagree , and believe that a clear message should be sent to Honduras that using the army to depose a president is not acceptable , our correspondent says .
Saturday deadline
The OAS has said it will suspend Honduras if Mr Zelaya is not reinstated by Saturday .
Mr Zelaya himself insists that he remains the country 's democratically elected leader .
The interim government - led by Roberto Micheletti , previously the speaker of Congress - says it may bring elections forward from their scheduled date of 29 November .
The OAS chief has said he will not see Mr Micheletti in order to avoid legitimising the government .
Mr Micheletti's foreign minister , Enrique Ortez , said Mr Insulza could " negotiate all he wants , except for Zelaya 's situation " .
" That is not negotiable because he cannot return to Honduras and if he does he will be arrested and tried . "
Thousands of Zelaya supporters demonstrated at a rally of their own in Tegucigalpa .

I contacted Mr. Summers again to obtain some clarification :
Mr. Summer , I appreciate your detailed and honest response .
I am also very glad that you recognize just how out of line Mr. Beck has been lately .
Yet I must question how committed you are to dropping support for Mr. Beck 's rhetoric : today , Binder & Binder ran two adds on the Glenn Beck program .
Now , I understand that you use the Run of Schedule format for your advertisements ; I also understand , from your previous email , that you have instructed Fox News to pull your ads from Beck 's program .
Has Binder & Binder reversed its position regarding its advertisements ?
Or has Fox News simply refused to honor your request ?
That would seem to be highly unprofessional conduct .
Thank you for your help in clarifying this matter
This is the response I received :
Under our present contract , I simply can't control where Fox news puts the Binder and Binder commercials .
So , Binder and Binder has asked Fox to remove its ads from Glenn Beck ; Fox has simply refused to honor that request .
This refusal is telling .
Fox can no longer depend on a large stable of wealthy advertisers to fill in should a RoS advertiser ask to opt out of a specific program .
Despite frequent calls of irrelevance by Fox and other media organizations , the movement against Glenn Beck is working .
Fox has become defensive , struggling to retain even the small RoS advertisers left .
It can not sustain this steady loss of advertisers , especially if those advertiser start dropping Fox entirely ( as Binder & Binder has threatened to do if Fox does n't honor its requests ) .
The message is clear : Keep It Up .
UPDATE :
I want to thank you all for the rec's .
Also , upon reading many of your comments and scrutinizing Mr. Summer 's replies , I 've come to the conclusion that he did indeed structure his words with some wiggle room built in .
I 've contacted him again asking for clear responses .
However , I do n't doubt Mr. Summer 's personal opinion on the matter - he more or less called Beck 's comments the rantings of a drunk - just the possible profit motivations ( which are always quite motivating ) .
I 'll keep you all updated .
In the mean time , keep contacting Beck 's remaining sponsors - by email , by phone , or ( as one commenter suggested ) by snail mail .
Several commenters have posted excellent sample emails ; every extra voice helps .
An Oklahoma sheriff and his deputy were sentenced to two years and three months in jail on Tuesday for the crime of stopping and searching motorists so that they could steal their cash .
An undercover federal sting operation caught McIntosh County Sheriff Terry Alan Jones , 36 , and Under - sheriff Mykol Travis Brookshire , 38 , red -handed .
The pair were forced to resign their positions in May and plead guilty to Conspiracy Under Color of Law to Interfere with Interstate Commerce .
“ The court imposed the maximum permissible federal prison term , consistent with advisory federal sentencing guidelines , ” United States Attorney Sheldon J. Sperling explained in a statement .
“ These sentences will not be subject to parole . ”
The sheriff ’s office conspiracy came to light after Marco Delgado - Hernandez was stopped on Interstate 40 on November 5 , 2007 .
Brookshire searched the man ’s vehicle and found $ 7000 in cash .
He then seized this money and allowed Delgado - Hernandez to go .
The next day , the district attorney ’s office refused to press any charges or authorize the monetary confiscation .
Assistant District Attorney Scott Biggs specifically ordered the money returned .
Almost one year later , Delgado - Hernandez , who had not received his money back , began making phone calls .
Sheriff Jones told him that it would take “ several weeks ” to process the paperwork .
The district attorney ordered it returned immediately .
This kicked off cooperation between state and federal officials to look into the matter .
On May 21 , 2009 McIntosh County Sheriff ’s Deputy Tonya French pulled over a vehicle containing what she thought was an ordinary motorist .
Brookshire was quickly dispatched to the scene to search the car .
Brookshire found six bundles in the car , each of which contained $ 5000 in cash .
Brookshire insisted that the driver sign a form releasing custody of the money to the county , and threatened to arrest him if he did not comply .
The man signed .
Brookshire took one bundle for himself and then reported five bundles of currency to the Drug Enforcement Agency ( DEA ) .
The driver in this case was an undercover agent working a sting operation in conjunction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and DEA .
Federal agents obtained a search warrant and found the “ missing ” bundle of money from the traffic stop had been split between Jones and Brookshire .
A total of $ 2600 was hidden in an air duct in Brookshire ’s house while $ 2400 was found in the home of Sheriff Jones .

Last year , you may recall , we pointed out that the Associated Press had a laughable sliding scale price if you wanted to copy and use more than 4 words ( the first 4 free ! ) .
After that , it cost $ 12.50 for 5 to 25 words .
This , of course , ignores fair use , which ( and , yes , it does depend on the circumstances ) almost certainly would let most people quote more than 4 words without having to pay .
But , of course , it gets worse .
Boing Boing points us to a little experiment by James Grimmelmann , testing out the AP 's text licensing system , where he discovers that you can put any text you want into the calculator , and the AP will gladly sell you a license .
So , just for fun , Grimmelmann paid $ 12 for a license to a ( public domain ) quote from Thomas Jefferson , culled not from the AP , but from Jefferson 's famous letter to Isaac McPherson , where he warns of the excesses of intellectual monopolies : Grimmelmann also points out the ridiculousness of the terms associated with licensing the content , including that it must be used exactly as written , and requires the exact attribution footer the AP 's system generates ( which never bothers to check to see if the content is actually from the article in question ) .
Oh yeah , it also does n't let you quote for " political Content , " however that 's defined .
It makes you wonder if the same folks who build this little anti-fair use licensing system are the same folks who are building their DRM for news
And , of course , there are similarly ridiculous situations , such as Dave Zatz finding out that it will cost himself $ 25 to quote himself ( thanks johnjac ) .
The AP keeps making a mockery of itself .
Of course , the AP has put out a statement , basically mimicking the one it put out last year , saying that the icopyright stuff is not intended for bloggers .
But then who is it intended for ?
Considering that the APthreatened bloggers in the past for quoting its words , the whole thing seems bizarre .
So you can rely on fair use if you 're a blogger , but not ... if you 're something else ?
How does that make sense ?
I 've read through our copyright laws more than a few times , and I do n't recall the clause that says " fair use applies to bloggers , but not others . " :
As a few people have pointed out , after all the media attention , the AP " revoked " the license .
Note the language .
They did n't apologize .
They did n't admit error .
They did n't admit awful technology and a silly policies .
They " revoked " a license they had no right to sell in the first place .
At least they gave him his money back .

Economist Bruce Bartlett had a column in Forbes outlining why he thinks spending wo n’t be cut .
Every time I write about the need to raise revenues to pay for federal spending , some nitwit always demands to know why we do n’t just cut spending .
That is not a viable option to deal with our fiscal problem .
The first point that people need to understand is that we live in a democracy .
We do n’t have a dictator who can just wave his hand and abolish government programs .
We have a president who may propose spending cuts , but before they take effect he must get agreement from both the House of Representatives and Senate , both of which may be controlled by a different party .
Congress ’ efforts to cut spending on its own are futile without prior agreement from the president to support them , as Republicans found out the hard way in 1995 .
Direct presidential control over spending is extremely limited .
By law , he must spend every dollar appropriated by Congress .
And presidents have no control at all over three - fifths of the budget devoted to interest on the debt and entitlement programs–those like Medicare for which spending is automatic .
Even Congress can’t reduce spending for entitlements unless it changes the law governing eligibility and programmatic operations .
So 60 % of the Federal budget cannot be touched in the budget process .
The national debt must continue to be serviced and entitlements ( ie. Social Security and Medicare ) can only be touched by changing eligibility and the actual operations and only as stand alone legislation for the most part .
So what about cutting the other 40 % ?
Wo n’t work …
Looking at last year ’s budget , only 38 % was classified as discretionary ; that is , under Congress ’s control through the appropriations process .
All the rest was mandatory : entitlements and interest on the debt .
Within the discretionary category , 54 % went to national defense .
Just $ 37.5 billion , 3.3 % of the discretionary budget , went for international affairs including foreign aid .
Over the years I have encountered many conservatives who thought that abolishing foreign aid was just about the only thing needed to balance the budget .
Obviously , that ’s nonsense .
Domestic discretionary spending amounted to $ 485 billion last year .
With a deficit last year of $ 459 billion , we would have had to abolish virtually every single domestic program to have achieved budget balance .
That means every penny spent on housing , education , agriculture , highway construction and maintenance , border patrols , air traffic control , the FBI , and every other thing one can think of outside of national defense , Social Security and Medicare .
Obviously that will never happen because most of the above programs have a constituency that supports them .
Bartlett also points out that it would help the situation if some of the proponents of budget cuts knew what the hell they were talking about :
Many of those favoring budget cuts have ridiculous notions about how much of the budget can be cut without reducing services .
A recent Gallup poll found that Americans generally believe that 50 % of the budget is wasted .
This suggests that they believe the federal budget could be cut in half without cutting anything important like Social Security benefits or national defense .
Just so people know the round numbers , total spending this year is about $ 3.6 trillion .
At most , $ 200 billion of that represents stimulus spending , so even if there had been no stimulus bill and the economy had done as well as it has done , we would be looking at a $ 3.4 trillion budget .
Revenues are only about $ 2.1 trillion , so we would be looking at a substantial deficit even if the stimulus package was never enacted .
Revenues would be even lower if Republicans had gotten their wish and the stimulus consisted entirely of tax cuts .
How tax cuts would help people with no wages because they have no jobs or businesses with no profits to tax was never explained .
But many right - wingers are convinced that tax cuts are the only appropriate governmental response no matter what the problem is .
It would also help matter if Republicans were n’t hypocrites :
This means that it is impossible to get control of spending without cutting entitlement programs .
Many Republicans agree , but they never make any serious effort to do so .
On the contrary , they defend entitlements when Democrats suggest cutting them .
The Republican National Committee has run television ads opposing cuts in Medicare because Obama proposed using such cuts to fund health reform .
Many demonstrators at right - wing tea parties were seen carrying signs demanding that the government keep its hands off Medicare .
Last year , we spent $ 456 billion on Medicare , and it is the fastest growing major government program .
How likely is it that the people protesting Obama ’s Medicare cuts will stand with Republicans if they propose cutting that program even more to balance the budget ?
They will switch sides in an instant .
The elderly will fight anyone who tries to cut their benefits even as they hypocritically demand fiscal responsibility and rant about the national debt .
The elderly are the reason why we have a national debt .
As for the great spending cutters Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher , well not so much :
When I raised these facts with a prominent Republican recently , he countered that Reagan had cut spending .
But he did n’t .
Spending rose from 21.7 % of the gross domestic product in 1980 to 23.5 % in 1983 before declining to 21.2 % in 1988 .
And that improvement came about largely because favorable demographics caused entitlement spending to temporarily decline from 11.9 % of GDP in 1983 to 10.1 % in 1988 .
( Last year it was 12.5 % of GDP . )
When I noted these facts , my friend pointed to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as someone who showed that spending could be slashed .
But she raised spending from 42.4 % of GDP when she took office in 1979 to 46 % of GDP in 1985 .
Only in her last years in office was spending cut to 38 % of GDP .
But keep in mind that Thatcher was in office for 10 years , longer than a U.S. president may serve , and had compete control of Parliament the whole time –something Reagan could only dream about .
Since it is not politically possible to cut Federal spending there are only three choices , from the argument laid out in the article :
A ) Raise taxes massively which would likely crush the American economy and continue to perpetuate the cycle of government growth consuming resources out of the private sector .
B ) Default on the national debt causing a national and global economic collapse .
C ) Continue the current cycle of bread and circuses of spending and spending more until options A and B come due .
However , I see Bartlett ’s argument as too defeatist in nature .
Neither of the three options is pleasant and fortunately , we do n’t have to choose between the three but that requires the American people and politicians making hard choices ( which they do n’t seem to know how to make ) .
Solving the long term financial crisis that will lead to national bankruptcy will take a grand bargain of sorts where every political faction will get some of what they want but will have to swallow some things they do n’t .
The left will have to swallow budget cuts to social welfare programs but they will applaud the tax increases that will be needed overall .
The right will have to swallow defense cuts and higher taxes but they will applaud overall budget decreases .
Libertarians will have to swallow a government not quite as small as they want and higher taxes but will applaud a shrunken Federal government both in size and scope both at home and abroad .
Populists will not like any of this because populism whether it be right - wing populism , left - wing populism , or even libertarian populism is predicated on the concept of having one ’s cake and eating it too .
Populism is generally anti-intellectual and solving the serious long - term financial problems of this nation will take more than a slogan or a media celebrity .
I do n’t see a role for populists in solving this nation ’s problems because they are generally the cause of them .
Over the coming weeks , I will lay out what I see as the ingredients of the great political grand bargain that will be needed to avert national bankruptcy .

Nitrous oxide ( N 2 O , aka laughing gas ) apart from being a powerful greenhouse gas , 298 times more effective at trapping heat than CO 2 , is also the single most important ozone depleting gas being emitted by human activities .
A paper published in this week ’s ScienceXpress , Nitrous Oxide ( N2O ) : the dominant ozone - depleting substance emitted in the 21st century , by Ravishankara , Daniel and Portman ( * ) , shows that as the chlorofluorcarbons controlled by the Montreal Protocol have been phased out , atmospheric N 2 O has continued to increase .
Here ’s the abstract :
By comparing the ozone depletion potential - weighted anthropogenic emissions of N 2 O with those of other ozone depleting substances , ODSs , we show that N 2 O emission currently is the single most important ODS emission and is expected to remain the largest throughout the 21st century .
N 2 O is unregulated by the Montreal Protocol .
Limiting future N 2 O emissions would enhance the recovery of the ozone layer from its depleted state , and would also reduce the anthropogenic forcing of the climate system , representing a â€˜win - winâ€™ for both ozone and climate .
This graph from the paper illustrates how the impact of CFCs has declined enormously over the last 20 years , while N 2 O has taken a leading role .
Commenting on the paper , NIWA scientists Dr Paul Johnston , Dr Greg Bodeker , Dr Richard McKenzie , and Dr Olaf Morgenstern , who study atmospheric chemistry at Lauder in Central Otago , had this to say :
“ The authors calculate that if anthropogenic N 2 O increases continue at current rates , by 2050 they would cause ozone depletion in excess of 30 % of that produced by CFCs at the peak loss in 1987 due to CFCs .
( N 2 O emissions are a byproduct of fertilizer use in agricultural , combustion , industrial process , etc. )
In the 1990s the average anthropogenic emissions were estimated to be nearly 40 % of the total emissions .
The authors conclude that a reduction in N 2 O emissions would benefit the ozone layer , as well as benefiting climate due to the greenhouse effect of N 2 O .
N 2 O emissions are an important chunk of NZ ’s overall greenhouse gas inventory , amounting to 17 % of the total , so any increased focus on N 2 O could have important policy implications for emissions control in NZ .
Fortunately , nitrification inhibitors – currently in use as well as being evaluated by the Pastoral Greenhouse Gas Research Consortium – offer a relatively straightforward approach to achieving reductions .

To mark the film ’s final use - by , or expiration , date , ' Polaroid : Exp 09.10.09 ’ at the Atlas Gallery in London brings together artists as diverse as the Hungarian - born fashion photographer and photojournalist André Kertész and the provocative Japanese photographer Nobuyoshi Araki , as well as a number of contemporary British artists , including Marc Quinn , commissioned specially for the show .
And of course Andy Warhol , who shot Polaroids as preparatory sketches for his paintings of subjects such as Bianca Jagger and Muhammad Ali .
Warhol often turned the camera on himself , as in his series known as the ' Fright Wigs ’ , his translucent face frozen in a frame of mad white hair .
' Mr Land invented this great camera called a Polaroid , ’ Warhol said .
' There is something about the camera that makes the person look just right .
I take at least 200 pictures and then I choose .
Sometimes I take half a picture and a lip from another picture . ’
All the images at Atlas are for sale .
A Helmut Newton ' Big Nude ’ Polaroid will sell for between £ 5,000 and £ 8,000 ( a bargain considering the traditional film version would set you back about £ 180,000 ) .
Meadowbrook , an Isle of Wight Day Centre which collects bikes for distribution to Africa via Colchester - based charity Re~Cycle , has been told by Hampshire Constabulary that they can no longer have unwanted bikes recovered by the force – because the Police might get sued if someone gets hurt .
We spoke to Tony Harding at Meadowbrook , who told us , " We collect up the bikes and send them to Colchester in batches of about 120 .
Re -Cycle do some repair work there , and other bikes are shipped out to Africa where the charity employs people to fix them up .
Then the bikes are given out in towns and villages for people to use .
It 's a brilliant scheme because it gives the people both work and transport . "
" We used to get about 10 - 15 bikes a month from the Police on the island .
They only have a small garage so they were more than happy to offload them to us .
Everyone was happy until this edict came along . "
And the reason for stopping the supply ?
Constabulary property manager Lucy Jenkins told the Isle of Wight County Press , " It would be irresponsible for Hampshire Constabulary to release bicycles to charities without first assuring they are safe for the public to use .
Unfortunately , the force does not have the resources available to conduct the necessary checks on every bicycle in its possession . "
" If the force released bicycles without appropriate checks and someone was injured due to the bicycle being unsafe , any compensation paid to that person by the force would come from the public purse , diverting funds from other policing areas . "
Since the bikes are n't ridden until they get to Africa , it 's difficult to see how there 's going to be any comeback , and Meadowbrook seem to have been affected by a blanket ban put in place to protect the force which applies to all charities .
However , despite explaining their situation the day centre has n't been able to get the ban lifted , and the bikes will now be scrapped rather than given to the charity .
We 've approached the Constabulary for a response , we 'll update this story if we get one .

Britain's war effort is being hampered by the number of front - line troops who are too fat or unfit to be deployed to southern Afghanistan .
A leaked memo sent to all army units and obtained by the Observer reveals that basic fitness policy " is not being carried out " and highlights concern among military commanders over a " worrying trend of obesity " that is limiting the number of soldiers fit enough to fight in Helmand .
Units are routinely failing to fulfil the army 's basic fitness regime of two hours of physical exercise a week , it adds , and the army must " reinvigorate a warrior ethos " .
To counter the problem , the army will introduce a " body composition measurement " policy this October to weed out overweight troops as well as enforcing a bare minimum of three physical training sessions a week .
" The numbers of personnel unable to deploy and concerns about obesity throughout the army are clearly linked to current attitudes towards physical training , " states the emergency memo from Major Brian Dupree of the army physical training corps in Wiltshire .
He warns that Britain 's " operational effectiveness " is being undermined and that soldiers ' lives could be placed at risk because some are unable to cope with the brutal conditions of Helmand province and the stresses of combat .
Last night a leading Conservative MP and retired colonel described the revelations as " disgraceful " at a time when commanders are demanding more British troops be sent to Afghanistan to hold ground recently seized from the Taliban during Operation Panther 's Claw .
Commanders have already sent an extra 125 troops to Helmand to replace those injured or killed in the offensive that saw the highest number of British casualties in Afghanistan since the conflict began .
Currently there are 3,860 army personnel classified as PUD - personnel unable to deploy - with a further 8,190 regarded as being of " limited deployability " for medical reasons .
The MoD cannot give a breakdown for how many of these are obese or simply unfit .
Dupree states in the memo dated 10 July : " The current army fitness policy states that to be fit to fight requires a minimum of two to three hours of physical activity per week .
It is clear that even this most basic policy is not being implemented .
" To cope with the demands of hybrid operations in Afghanistan and future conflicts the army needs personnel with that battle - winning edge that sustains them through adversity .
It is clear this message has been diluted recently and this attitude must change .
" The increasing PUD list and concerns over obesity in the services are clearly linked to this indifferent attitude . "
He concludes that the army has " not consistently maintained our standards of physical fitness " and needs to " reinvigorate a warrior ethos and a culture of being fit " .
Patrick Mercer MP , head of strategy at the Army Training & Recruiting Agency , said : " This lack of personal fitness is a disgraceful state of affairs .
The army is desperately undermanned anyway and for obesity to be a problem is extraordinary . "
Dupree 's report comes three years after the army relaxed its rules to allow recruits with a higher body mass index ( BMI ) to join after research found that two thirds of British teenagers were too fat to meet fitness requirements .
Applicants with a BMI of 32 - two points above the World Health Organisation 's definition of obesity - can now enlist .
An army board of inquiry in 2007 revealed how a soldier who died of heat stroke in Iraq was " at the higher level of obese " .
Investigators revealed that concerns were expressed about Private Jason Smith 's BMI .
Dupree 's report states : " The demands on time , which are acknowledged , are such that physical training has been regarded as something that can be cut from busy schedules .
This approach cannot continue .
Strong leadership is expected in this area . "

LONDON , July 12 ( UPI ) -- Robert Plant , the former Led Zeppelin singer , has been made a commander of the British Empire in London , Buckingham Palace says .
E! Online reports Prince Edward of Wales bestowed the prestigious honor on Plant Friday .

By receiving the commander status , the 60 - year - old singer now outranks fellow Led Zeppelin alum Jimmy Page .
Page was honored as an officer of the British Empire four years ago .
E ! Online noted the British royal family had previously conferred knighthood on rockers Paul McCartney , Mick Jagger and Elton John .
So far , the US government has been diligently repeating each and every mistake committed during The Great Depression .
The only thing they had left undone so far was to match the Smoot - Hawley Tarriff Act from 1930 , widely recognized as the worst decision during that period :
In mid 1930 the Smoot - Hawley Tariff is signed into law , raising import tariffs to record highs , and spreading protectionism all over the world – consumers and exporters suffer from the ensuing decline of international trade
Now , president Obama is rushing in to fill that void :
In a break with the trade policies of his predecessor , President Obama announced on Friday night that he would impose a 35 percent tariff on automobile and light - truck tires imported from China .
The decision is a major victory for the United Steelworkers , the union that represents American tire workers .
And Mr. Obama cannot afford to jeopardize his relationship with major unions as he pushes Congress to overhaul the nation ’s health care system .
But China is certain to be antagonized by the decision , made less than two weeks before Mr. Obama will come face to face with Chinese leaders at a summit meeting in Pittsburgh for the Group of 20 industrialized and fast - growing emerging nations .
The decision signals the first time that the United States has invoked a special safeguard provision that was part of its agreement to support China ’s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001 .
Under that safeguard provision , American companies or workers harmed by imports from China can ask the government for protection simply by demonstrating that American producers have suffered a “ market disruption ” or a “ surge ” in imports from China .
Unlike more traditional anti-dumping cases , the government does not need to determine that a country is competing unfairly or selling its products at less than their true cost .
The International Trade Commission had already determined that Chinese tire imports were disrupting the $ 1.7 billion market and recommended that the president impose the new tariffs .
Members of the commission , an independent government agency , voted 4 - 2 on June 29 to recommend that President Obama impose tariffs on Chinese tires for three years .
Mr. Obama had until this coming Thursday to make a decision .
American imports of Chinese tires tripled between 2004 and 2008 , and China ’s share of the American market grew to 16.7 percent , from 4.7 percent , according to the United States Trade Representative .
Four American tire factories closed in 2006 and 2007 , and several more are set to close this year .
The Tire Industry Association has opposed the tariffs , arguing that they will not preserve American jobs but will instead cause manufacturers to relocate plants to other countries where they can produce tires cheaply .
President George W. Bush received four similar recommendations from the trade commission , the most recent one involving steel pipe in December 2005 , but he rejected all of those recommendations .
Under the law , the president is allowed to accept or reject the commission ’s recommendations .
“ The president decided to remedy the clear disruption to the U.S. tire industry based on the facts and the law in this case , ” the president ’s spokesman , Robert Gibbs , said in a statement Friday night .
Mr. Gibbs said the United States , which already imposes a 4 percent tariff on Chinese tires , would impose an additional tariff of 35 percent for one year .
The tariff will be reduced to 30 percent in the second year and 25 percent in the third year .
The tariff is to take effect on Sept. 26 .
The trade commission proposed higher tariffs than the president actually imposed , recommending an initial levy of 55 percent .
The president of United Steelworkers International , Leo W. Gerard , applauded Mr. Obama ’s decision , saying , “ The president sent the message that we expect others to live by the rules , just as we do . ”
Senator Sherrod Brown , an Ohio Democrat who had pressed for the tariffs , also praised the decision .
He said in a statement , “ If American workers and manufacturers are going to compete in the global market , they need to have a government that uses trade enforcement tools . ”
After eight years of hard work , the day has finally arrived .
Today , September 14 , the Haiku project has released its very first alpha release .
With the goal of recreating one of the most beloved operating systems in history , the BeOS , they took on no small task , but it seems as if everything is finally starting to come together .
Let ’s talk about the history of the BeOS , where Haiku comes from , and what the Alpha is like .
Rochester , Minn . — Criminal charges have been filed against a Rochester girl accused of faking her own kidnapping to extort money from her family , leading them to believe that she would be killed if they did n’t come up with $ 500 .
The 16 - year - old girl is charged in Olmsted District Juvenile Court with felony attempt to coerce , felony motor vehicle theft and petty misdemeanor theft .
She is being held at the Many Rivers Juvenile Detention Center in Rochester pending her next court hearing on Wednesday .
The girl ’s younger sister called police Wednesday morning and said her sister had called a mutual friend .
She was crying and said she was being held against her will in the Twin Cities and would be killed if her family did not give them $ 500 .
The younger sister said she talked with a man who said the 16 - year - old owed money to “ some people ” and that if the sister gave him the money , he would get it to the people the 16 - year - old owed .
The younger sister told police she got a call from her sister , who said she was locked in a basement in the Twin Cities , that she would be killed if the money was n’t paid or if the family contacted law enforcement .
The girl said her older sister sounded frantic .
The girl ’s mother told police that the girl took her car the previous evening despite being told not to .
The man told police that the 16 - year - old made up the kidnapping story after she ran away from home .
He had been in touch with the girl throughout the day and sent her a text message , saying he had the money and they should meet at Bear Creek Park .
The complaint said the girl was arrested at the park in her mother ’s car .
She reportedly said she took the car and called her sister with the kidnapping story because her mother did n’t like her friends and would n’t let her go to the school she preferred .

As readers of this blog know , I ’m not a fan ( with the rare exception ) of the Northwest style of IPA .
I acknowledge and accept that the IPA has its place , and the style is truly loved by some , but the trend over the last few years for virtually every big beer bar and virtually every beer festival to dedicate a quarter to a half of the available taps to IPAs has been an ongoing irritation .
So it was with great pleasure that I read a recent post on Dr. Wort ’s Buzz-erk Beer Blog : Shifting Beer Trends : IPA OUT – SOUR IN !
Nate calls the LATE IPA trend , the “ obscene hop content ” trend .
I for one will be glad to see it die down … .
Nothing worse than walking into a pub or brewpub that has 85 % of their beer selection IPA ’s .
That ’s just obnoxious !
I think anyone would , rightly , balk if 85 % of taps were dedicated to sour beers .
But this is how it is with IPAs right now .
My ( perhaps naive ) hope is that a few of the IPA taps be replaced , not exclusively with sour ales , but a variety of other styles !
However , if all IPA taps were replaced with sour ale taps , I would enjoy that a lot more than the current situation .
In the blog post Dr. Wort reminds us of the beer style trends that came before IPAs : stouts , pale ales , weizens .
And explains what , exactly , a sour beer is .
For one thing , the moniker encompasses multiple styles :
It ’s really way to generalized a term covering a vast expression of “ Styles ” from Lambics to Flemish Reds to Berliner Weisse .
All three of the beers are completely different from each other .
Generally , all these beer are Tart or Sour or funkified to some degree with Wild Yeasts and Bacteria .
Read the whole post :
And recently I stumbled upon a great resource for finding Lambic and wild ales in Portland :
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Militant Islamist group al Qaeda threatened Germany with attacks for the second time this weekend in an online video criticizing the country for its deployment of troops in Afghanistan , authorities said on Sunday .
The interior ministry identified al Qaeda ’s messenger in the latest video as Bekkay Harrach , a German - Moroccan who also appeared in a separate clip on Friday warning Germany faced a “ rude awakening ” if it did not end its “ war ” in Afghanistan .
Television footage showed Harrach , who is 32 according to German media , wearing a mask in the latest video .
Harrach was clean shaven and wearing a suit and tie in the previous recording in which he directly addressed German Chancellor Angela Merkel , saying that attacks could follow Germany ’s federal election on September 27 .
“ In a democracy , only the people can order its soldiers home , ” Harrach said in German in the first video .
“ If the German people decides for a continuation of the war , then it has passed judgment upon itself and showed the whole world that in a democracy civilians are not innocent after all . ”
Germany stepped up security at airports and train stations this weekend due to the heightened risk of attack , fearing that militant groups could use the election as a stage for strikes to punish Germany for its troop deployment in Afghanistan .
Of the five parties in Germany ’s Bundestag lower house of parliament , only the far - left “ Linke ” or Left Party is calling for an immediate troop pull - out from Afghanistan .
Unlike other European countries such as Britain or Spain , Germany , which has 4,200 troops in Afghanistan , has not experienced a major attack on home soil in recent years .
Domestic pressure on Germany to rethink its mission grew this month following a NATO air strike called in by German forces which left scores of people dead .
It took Merkel two years to visit Afghanistan after taking office in 2005 and she rarely mentions the mission there unless events on the ground demand a response as they did this week .
Until now , her government has refused to call the conflict a “ war , ” instead selling it to voters as a humanitarian mission focused on civilian reconstruction and police training .
The Mississippi Department of Human Services ( DHS ) recently ruled that a woman was an unfit mother because she can't speak English .
The DHS declared that the inability to speak English , " placed her unborn child in danger and will place the baby in danger in the future . "
Baltazar Cruz is a 34 - year - old women from the Oaxaca region of Mexico .
She is from a small village of 1,500 people , almost all of them Chatino Indians like herself .
Cruz , who was raised speaking Chatino , speaks only a little bit of Spanish and no English .
In the early 2000 's she immigrated to the U.S. , hoping to escape the poverty of her small , remote village , and send money back to her mother and two children .
Eventually , she found work in a restaurant along the Gulf Coast in Mississippi .
She became pregnant ( she refuses to identify the father ) and gave birth to her third child last November at the Singing River Hospital in Pascagoula , MI where she currently lives .
For unknown reasons , the hospital called the DHS and Cruz 's baby girl , Rubí , was taken from her .
Cruz is now in the process of being deported while also fighting to regain custody of a child ripped away from its mother for no logical reason .
Luckily , Cruz has some advocates .
Her case has been taken by the Mississippi Immigrants ' Rights Alliance ( MIRA ) and the Southern Poverty Law Center .
Although the lawyers are unable to comment on the case due to a legal gag order , Mary Bauer , the SPLC 's legal director , told Time magazine
that the idea that a mother can lose custody of her child because she does n't speak a particular language " is an fundamentally outrageous violation of human rights . "
Although the DHS has repeatedly stated that language has nothing to do with why the child was stolen from its mother , this is , unfortunately not the first time that something like this has happened .
In 2004 a Tennessee judge ordered a child of a Mexican migrant mother who spoke only an indigenous language into foster care .
And just last year , a California
court took custody of the U.S. - born twins of another indigenous , illegal immigrant from Oaxaca .
In both cases , the children were eventually returned to their rightful families .
Classically - trained designers , and really every professional designer , should know the old adage that long line lengths can have a counterproductive impact on readability .
The trusty copy of Bringhurst 's authoritative The Elements of Typographic Style makes this rule fairly cut -and - dry :
Anything from 45 to 75 characters is widely - regarded as a satisfactory length of line for a single - column page set in a serifed text face in a text size .
The 66 - character line ( counting both letters and spaces ) is widely regarded as ideal .
So naturally , when designers work on the web , they 're keeping this rule in mind .
Consequently , it 's become a best practice on the web to keep line lengths below 75 characters , and this best practice has been the source of dissent against movements for things like variable - width ( fluid ) layouts and the like .
But research does n't support this claim , at least on the web .
Instead , users are able to read significantly longer line lengths on the web , and it actually increases efficiency and comprehension .
The Research
The first research I could find relating to this topic went all the way back to 2005 .
The study , The Effects of Line Length on Reading Online News , looked at how well college students read news on the screen at different line lengths .
They tested line lengths of 35 , 55 , 75 , and 95 characters .
The study came to two important conclusions :
Reading speed was highest at 95 cpl , and lowest at 35 cpl on screen .
Reading efficiency was again highest at 95 cpl .
They found that line length no impact on comprehension on the screen
These days , it would be a bit nicer to have a wider array of line lengths , perhaps going up to 115 or 135 cpl , but this is a useful study .
Guesswork
In a very brief and informal search , I came across a healthy number of sites that had line lengths around or above 100 characters that seemed quite readable , including my own blog .
So what makes the screen significantly different from print that would impact comprehension in this way ?
A few guesses , with absolutely no basis in research , the third being my favorite :
We 've been conditioned to longer lengths by websites that have tended to stretch the top end of this limit , as opposed to newspapers , which tend to stretch the lower end .
The active lighting of a computer display is more conducive to longer line lengths than passive paper .
Perhaps line lengths that are out of proportion with their medium are more difficult to read .
Print tends to have vertical layouts , which would naturally correspond to shorter lines , while we tend to use widescreen monitors these days .
Perhaps the widescreen monitors are more conducive to the readability of a proportionally - longer line length .
If the range of line lengths had been wider in the study , and if we had an updated study since the widescreen monitors had become popular , we could really see what might be impacting the difference .
Best Practices
So should you really be limiting your line length to 75 characters ?
This research suggests you should n't .
Users will be perfectly fine reading longer columns of text .
What is the new standard ?
Tough to say , but 100 cpl seems to be within the range of feasibility .
There may be a good opportunity for some new and more thorough research in this area that could offer some valuable new insight .

After watching this , Dean may be right .
Now a lot of political talk is going on about dumping the public option and going with co-ops .
Finally , maybe , Obama is realizing that the Republicans wo n't vote for ANYTHING and the Democrats must go it alone .
Again , why were we wasting time with them ?????
Whatever happens , if Obama does not have a public option in the bill , the Democrats are IN MAJOR TROUBLE in 2010 .

Facebook has acquired social networking site aggregator FriendFeed .
Financial details of the deal were not announced , but all FriendFeed employees will join Facebook and senior executive at FriendFeed will join Facebook 's engineering and product teams , Facebook said in a release .
" As my mom explained to me , when two companies love each other very much , they form a structured investment vehicle , " FriendFeed co-founder Bret Taylor wrote in a blog post .
FriendFeed aggregates and publishes updates from sites like Twitter , Yelp , Netflix , Blogger , and Flickr in one stream .
It debuted in 2007 and is the brainchild of Taylor , Paul Buchheit , Jim Norris , and Sanjeev Singh  all former Google employees who worked on products like Gmail and Google Maps .
" Facebook and FriendFeed share a common vision of giving people tools to share and connect with their friends , " Taylor said in a statement .
" It was immediately obvious to us how passionate Facebook 's engineers are about creating simple , ground - breaking ways for people to share , and we are extremely excited to join such a like - minded group , " Buchheit added .
FriendFeed will continue to operate normally " for the time being , " Taylor said in his blog post , including the company API .
" We 're still figuring out our longer - term plans for the product with the Facebook team , " he wrote , urging users to watch the FriendFeed News group for updates .
" Since I first tried FriendFeed , I 've admired their team for creating such a simple and elegant service for people to share information , " Mark Zuckerberg , Facebook founder and CEO , said in a statement .
" As this shows , our culture continues to make Facebook a place where the best engineers come to build things quickly that lots of people will use . "
FriendFeed unveiled a new beta of its service in April , a version PCMag.com found to be innovative but a bit overwhelming .
ExxonMobil , the world ’s largest publicly traded oil and gas company , pleaded guilty in federal court Thursday to charges that it killed 85 protected birds -- including hawks , owls and waterfowl .
The company violated the Migratory Bird Treaty
Act in five states over the last five years , according to the Department of Justice .
The company , which reported more than $ 4 billion in earnings for the second quarter of 2009 , will pay $ 400,000 in fines and $ 200,000 in community service fees to waterfowl rehabilitation and preservation programs .
It will be placed on probation for three years and must implement a plan to minimize bird deaths during that time .
Most of the birds died after exposure to hydrocarbons in uncovered natural gas pits , oil tanks and waste water facilities at ExxonMobil drilling and production plants in Colorado , Wyoming , Kansas , Oklahoma and Texas , court documents stated .
Open pits and tanks often attract waterfowl and other birds , which may land in the chemicals and attempt to feed , according to the documents .

“ ExxonMobil has extensive operations across the U.S. with bird populations in the millions , ” a company representative said in a written statement .
“ Our upstream operations have reported events involving fewer than 100 birds over the past six years . ”
The company said it had spent more than $ 2.5 million on nets and plastic “ bird balls ” that float on the surface of pits and tanks to prevent bird landings at facilities in Colorado and Wyoming .
“ We are all responsible for protecting our wildlife , even the largest of corporations , ” said Colorado U.S. Atty .
David M. Gaouette in the Justice Department statement .
“ An important part of this case is the implementation of an environmental compliance plan that will help prevent future migratory bird deaths . ”
Bird deaths at ExxonMobil facilities date back to 2003 , when employees found two dead mallards in the water near a production plant in Colorado .
At the time , an agent of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service warned ExxonMobil that it would continue to kill birds if it did not create barriers to natural gas pits and wells containing toxic chemicals , court documents stated .

“ There are thousands of such wells across the West and thousands more since the Bush administration opened it all up , ” said Kert Davies , research director for Greenpeace USA .
“ How many dead birds go undetected ? ”

Unusually , it might be neither .
Last week Wikileaks posted a link to a copy of a database , in comma-separated variable form , which Royal Mail has confirmed is a copy of its PostZon product , which contains a longitude / latitude pair , NHS ward and county location for every one of the UK's 1.8 m postcodes .
Given that Royal Mail charges from £ 50 ( for a single user annual licence ) to £ 25,000 ( for a corporate annual licence ) for PostZon , you might expect this leak to have a noticeable effect on its revenues for the product – and also lead to an army of web developers using the data for free to cross-reference postcodes against maps .
Such postcode lookups are used all the time , for instance in web applications that try to show amenities near to your location or that do route planning .
But the initial signs are that that wo n't happen .
While many developers are eager to access a lookup table for postcodes , there is considerable distrust among the community that the PostZon database is " clean " – that is , contains no intentionally wrong entries that Royal Mail could use to identify unlicensed use .
Such an intentional mistake – known as a Mountweazel or Nihilartikel – effectively poisons the database to unlicensed users , because its presence proves that the data was copied rather than created from scratch .
( Under EU database laws , Royal Mail owns the copyright in the list even without such entries , but would have to demonstrate that all the entries could only have come from its database – a tougher task than finding the planted error . )
The Royal Mail would not say if the database contains such errors : " We do n't discuss our security procedures for protecting our intellectual property , " said a spokesman – though clearly those procedures have broken down on at least one level .
And what economic harm might Royal Mail suffer through this leak ?
" We 're not discussing that , " said the spokesman .
Guardian Technology 's Free Our Data campaign argues that the PostZon database – and the other Royal Mail location databases , principally its Postcode Address File ( PAF ) , with postcode details for 18 m locations – should be available for free , without copyright , so that everyone can use them without having to rely on third - party lookup systems ( from organisations such as Google and Yahoo , which provide an API to their own versions of PostZon ) .
In the meantime , there are still crowdsourcing efforts going on to create copyright - free postcode lists : the New Popular Edition Maps site has a collection of open - sourced postcode locations – although there are presently only 58,000 postcodes in the collected list ( which also includes those from Free The Postcode ) .
But one thing 's certain : none of them come from the Royal Mail .
Corazon C. Aquino of the Philippines , who was swept into office on a wave of “ people power ” in 1986 and then faced down half a dozen coup attempts in six years as president , died Saturday in Manila , her son said .
She was 76 .
Her son , Senator Benigno S. Aquino III , known as Noynoy , said in a statement that she died at 3:18 a.m .
She learned she had advanced colon cancer last year and had been hospitalized in Manila for more than a month , he said .
The cancer had spread to other organs , he added , and she was too weak to continue chemotherapy .
Demure but radiant in her familiar yellow dress , Mrs. Aquino brought hope to the Philippines as a presidential candidate , then led its difficult transition to democracy from 20 years of autocratic rule under her predecessor , Ferdinand E. Marcos .
That initial triumph of popular will  after a fraudulent election in which Mr. Marcos claimed victory , though most people believed that Mrs. Aquino had won  was a high point in modern Philippine history , and it offered a model for nonviolent uprisings that has been repeated often in other countries .

Porsche 911 GT2 9ff BT2 – 850 HP Monster Dominates the Pack
Share Pin 8 11 Shares
Lately , it seems as if the horsepower wars have re-ignited in the world of Porsche , and the new battlefield is the 997 GT2 .
A few weeks back we reported on the release of the Wimmer RS Porsche 911 GT2 with 680 hp and just a couple of days ago , we discussed the latest tuning package from American Switzer Performance that pushes the GT2 up to 800 hp .
Now , German tuner 9ff has trumped the pack once again with their 9ff BT2 ( bi- turbo 2 ) offering which produces a ridiculous 850 hp .
This makes their Porsche 911 GT2 good for a 0 to 100 km/h ( 62 mph ) run in 3 seconds flat , reaching 200 km/h ( 124 mph ) in just 8.7 seconds and hitting 300 km/h ( 186 mph ) in only 18.5 seconds .
Top speed is rated at 386 km/h ( 240 mph ) .
9ff will even tweak things a bit more for you if you are interested in taking better acceleration over top - end speed by revising the gearing .
We are really digging the baby blue and orange Gulf livery and lightweight alloy wheels finished in black on the Porche 997 GT2 .
The small white circles filled in with 850 on the doors are a nice touch .
Weight has been reduced through the use of carbon fiber body panels and a revised aerodynamics kit which provides an additional 70 kg of front downforce and 90 kg of rear downforce .
Unfortunately , there is no information yet on how the engine modifications are actually performed .
Let ’s hope their solution is as elegant as Switzer ’s bolt - on application .
The total cost of the new 9ff BT2 is € 285,000 ( $ 400.955 USD ) .
This is € 95,500 ( $ 134,368 USD ) above the list price for the Porsche 911 GT2 .

President Obama sparred with ABC ’s George Stephanopoulos over what constitutes a tax .
From ABC News ’ Jake Tapper
President Obama and George Stephanopoulos got into a somewhat contentious back and forth yesterday about whether or not the penalty for those who do not abide by the individual mandate in the health care reform bill offered by Sen.
Max Baucus , D - Mont. , constitutes a tax .
You can watch their exchange HERE .
“ Under this mandate , the government is forcing people to spend money , fining you if you don’t , ” Stephanopoulos said .
“ How is that not a tax ? ”
“ Well , hold on a second , George , ” said the president .
“ Here — here ’s what ’s happening .
You and I are both paying $ 900 , on average — our families — in higher premiums because of uncompensated care .
Now what I ’ve said is that if you ca n’t afford health insurance , you certainly should n’t be punished for that .
That ’s just piling on .
If , on the other hand , we ’re giving tax credits , we ’ve set up an exchange , you are now part of a big pool , we ’ve driven down the costs , we ’ve done everything we can and you actually can afford health insurance , but you ’ve just decided , you know what , I want to take my chances .
And then you get hit by a bus and you and I have to pay for the emergency room care , that ’s … ”
“ That may be , but it ’s still a tax increase , ” said Stephanopoulos .
“ No , ” said the president .
“ That ’s not true , George .
The — for us to say that you ’ve got to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase .
What it ’s saying is , is that we ’re not going to have other people carrying your burdens for you anymore than the fact that right now everybody in America , just about , has to get auto insurance .
Nobody considers that a tax increase .
People say to themselves , that is a fair way to make sure that if you hit my car , that I ’m not covering all the costs . ”
Said Stephanopoulos : “ But it may be fair , it may be good public policy … ”
“ No , but — but , George , you — you ca n’t just make up that language and decide that that ’s called a tax increase , ” said the president .
“ What …if I say that right now your premiums are going to be going up by 5 or 8 or 10 percent next year and you say well , that ’s not a tax increase ; but , on the other hand , if I say that I do n’t want to have to pay for you not carrying coverage even after I give you tax credits that make it affordable , then … ”
Stephanopoulos cited Merriam Webster ’s Dictionary definition .
“ Tax — ‘ a charge , usually of money , imposed by authority on persons or property for public purposes . ' ”
“ George , the fact that you looked up Merriam ’s Dictionary , the definition of tax increase , indicates to me that you ’re stretching a little bit right now , ” said the president .
“ Otherwise , you would n’t have gone to the dictionary to check on the definition … .
I absolutely reject that notion ” that it ’s a tax increase .
Hmmm .
Well maybe someone should tell that to the author of the bill .
Because , as Politico ’s Chris Frates points out , it ’s all right there on page 29 of the bill : “ Excise Tax .
The consequence for not maintaining insurance would be an excise tax . ”
To be more specific , if a taxpayer ‘s modified adjusted gross income is between 100-300 percent of the federal poverty level , “ the excise tax for failing to obtain coverage for an individual in a taxpayer unit ( either as a taxpayer or an individual claimed as a dependent ) is $ 750 per year .
However , the maximum penalty for the taxpayer unit is $ 1,500 . ”
If a taxpayer ‘s modified adjusted gross income is above 300 percent of federal poverty level “ the penalty for failing to obtain coverage for an individual in a taxpayer unit ( either as a taxpayer or as an individual claimed as a dependent ) is $ 950 year ” — with a maximum penalty of $ 3,800 .
“ Exemptions from the excise tax will be made for individuals where the full premium of the lowest cost option available to them ( net of subsidies and employer contribution , if any ) exceeds ten percent ” of their adjusted gross income .
So …it ’s not a tax ?
This raises the question as to whether or not the president has read the bill .
Or maybe he does n’t consider an excise tax a tax .
Go figure .
Post # 2346
Unless your last name is Rockefeller or Vanderbilt or Gates or Ellison or Buffett , you probably ca n’t be both .
Many , many people choose to appear rich .
This usually means buying a house you can’t really afford , cars you can’t really afford , and all sorts of electronic devices and jewelry and other items that you ca n’t really afford .
Outwardly , you appear to have lots of money , but you ’re actually sinking in a giant pile of debt , barely able to keep your head above water .
In this case , the appearance of affluence does n’t equal financial independence .
Instead , it equals a huge amount of financial dependence .
People in such situations depend on their employer for steady employment .
They depend on their continued good health .
They depend on minimizing major unexpected events – a transmission failure can be devastating .
They depend on a reasonably strong credit rating while they juggle all of the debt .
That ’s far from financial independence .
But from the outside , it does look good .
These are the people who have a nice house and nice cars but seem not to have high paying careers .
Do they have it all ?
Maybe at a glance , but the stress is intense .
They ’re constantly walking a high wire .
If someone loses a job or the car ’s transmission fails or a child gets devastatingly sick , the whole thing falls apart .
And it ’s scary .
Most of the time , people who appear rich do all they can to pretend such things can’t possibly happen to them , but late at night , they know such things certainly can happen to them – and they worry .
A lot .
A big part of the focus tends to be short term happiness and impressing other people – but long term happiness and enjoying yourself takes a big back seat .
Fake it until you make it ?
Only if you ’re bringing something more to the table – and that “ something more ” comes through without lots of superficial elements to impress others .
Trust me ,
I ’ve been there .
It can be fun in the short term , but over the long haul , you realize how many opportunities in life you ’re missing .
On the other hand , one can choose to be rich .
From my perspective , being rich means being as financially independent as possible – almost no life events can impact your situation – and being surrounded by the things you care the most about .
Yes , this has one disadvantage over appearing rich : you do n’t get lots of shiny things whenever you want them .
But it comes with tons of additional advantages .
You ’re not tied to your job for purposes of compensation .
If you hate your job , quit and find something you do n’t hate .
The money is n’t the constraint .
You ’re not buried in bills .
Each month , you do n’t have to pay much at all out in required bills .
You do n’t have tons of different things that need constant care and maintenance .
You ’re not cleaning a 6,000 square foot house .
You ’re not caring for five different cars .
You ’re not keeping up an immaculately landscaped yard .
Sure , if you ’re passionate about one of these , you can chase it – but if you do n’t care , there ’s no need to have them or maintain them at all .
You do n’t have “ friends ” that constantly judge you based on the stuff you have .
You do n’t worry about having enough money when you retire .
In the end , it comes back to one simple question : do you want to appear rich , or do you want to be rich ?
How is your focus ?
Do you find it easy to concentrate for longer chunks of time or are you easily distracted ?
Do you enjoy doing the same thing at the same focus level over and over again , or are you easily bored ?
I used to think that focus is a function of pleasure : I can concentrate on this because I like it .
I do some stuff better than other because I like it .
While loving what you do can keep your concentration high , at least in the beginning , maintaining a constant , high focus is not a function of pleasure at all .
It ’s a function of will .
Focus can be trained .
It can be enhanced , it can be shaped the way you want .
It can serve you well , if you treat it well .
In today ’s post I ’ll share some of my observations regarding focus and how one can work this tool the same way you work your muscles in your daily workout .
Detach From Pleasure
To like something is a great “ do ” igniter .
It really puts you on the road .
Starting something you do n’t like is usually slower and less energizing .
But after the initial thrill , even if you do like what you ’re doing , keeping yourself in the flow requires a lot of effort .
Your focus will start to weaken .
The best way to ensure a constant flow of focus is to detach from pleasure .
To treat every single task emotionally equal .
Might sounds “ robotish ” and totally not fun , but in fact it ’s just a way to trick your focus into a better approaching method .
If you ’re constantly doing only things you like , your focus will develop a sort of addiction .
It will unconsciously start looking for nice stuff , and will ignore difficult , or boring things .
It will not discard it and put it aside for later , the boring stuff will simply disappear from the radar .
You ’ll end up as a hedonistic prisoner of “ only nice stuff , please ” .
Detaching from pleasure does n’t mean you will refrain from enjoying what you ’re doing .
Detaching from pleasure means you ’ll start doing things regardless of their niceness level .
You ’ll just do them .
Detaching from pleasure means you ’re also detaching from boredom .
If you can observe yourself doing stuff , pleasure and boredom are just choices .
You ’re doing that thing anyway , so you can chose how you feel about it .
Assess Results
Whenever you keep your focus on something for longer chunks , take your time to assess results every once in a while .
Take your time to see how were you at the beginning of the task and how are you now .
Especially in difficult tasks , assessing results is a great focus enhancer .
It does this by progress showing .
If you ’re caught in solving a longer problem , you might forget where you started .
You start circling and stumbling .
You get caught in a pattern of “ I ’m getting nowhere with this ” and your focus will start weaken .
The hedonistic part of you will ask for something nice to hang on , and you ’ll step away form the problem and go grab a cookie , for instance .
If after the cookie your focus will be higher , it would be great , but your focus is usually thinner .
You did n’t assess any results , you just tried to escape a difficult task .
Your focus will want again to the cookie .
Assessing results is easy , is a matter of saying : “ I started this journey 15 minutes ago , and I ’m doing ok , regardless of the fact I ’ve done only one single step .
I ’m ok .
I ’m on it . ” .
Your focus will be forced to stay there until you solve the problem .
You assessed your position , you acknowledged the fact that you ’re making progress .
This works regardless of the focus time span .
You can assess results of a 15 minutes cooking session , or of a 5 years goal .
Maintaining your focus is equally important in both .
One More Second
I took this habit from my fitness session .
Whenever I do pushups or abs , I establish some goal , let ’s say 50 abs .
When I ’m close to 49 , I stretch myself out and go over 50 , usually 51 , or 52 .
I do the this all the time .
The goal is clear but I always try to stay in there for one more second .
I also did this in business .
Whenever I was close to finish a project , I did something extra , a feature or an addition of some kind .
It was not in the specs from the beginning but I felt the need to put it there .
Staying “ one more second ” in a project , in a workout , or in a relationship is a fantastic focus enhancer .
I always know that I can do more abs after that second and I always know that my project will be a success , after that last feature .
I am in there , I know it , I stay focused .
“ One more second ” is also good for assessing wrong paths .
Even if you feel it ’s wrong , take one more second to assess that and let your focus decide .
If it ’s a bad relationship , stay one more second in it and make sure it ’s really bad for you .
Next time , your focus will warn you from the beginning , and you wo n’t have to go through tough times again .
Balance Your Senses
Your focus is channeling the reality by using your senses .
Each person have a specific distribution of these senses in their focus .
Some are visual , some are functioning well by really touching stuff , some are reacting better to voices .
Your senses are the gates and your focus is the gate opener .
Focus likes diversity .
If you ’re a visual guy , try using some sounds in the next working session .
Put some music on , tap the table from time to time .
If you ’re doing something related to sounds ( you ’re a musician for instance , or working on a movie soundtrack ) try to balance this by using some new lights around you .
Change your seat , light a candle .
It will instantly make you focus better .
Your focus will always appreciate a new balance in your senses .
It ’s not about boredom , we talked about that already .
What you ’re doing is sending a complementary signal that will make your focus trying to recompose the big picture .
And that will keep it on the current task .
Your Focus Is Your Reality
Ok , I cheated a bit .
I started with all those tips about focus enhancement and kept the focus definition aside .
And I did this for a reason .
I strongly believe that your focus is in fact your reality .
You can not experience something outside your focus .
Everything you do is driven by focus , it ’s like a handle to keep and master your environment .
It ’s the only way you actively experience your life : whenever you ’re not focused , you ’re drifting away , whenever you ’re focused you ’re sailing .
Let ’s make a short experiment now .
Take a look at the wall in front of you .
Yes , like right now .
Take a look , I said , do n’t cheat .
🙂
After several seconds come back here and read on .
Where was your focus while you looked at the wall ?
Outside this blog post , of course , what a silly question .
But where was the blog post during this period ?
You ’ll answer that it was there , right in front of you , waiting for your to get back .
It was in your mind .
But I will say this blog post was completely outside your reality .
You might have think it was there , but it was on a virtual space and time .
Your real space and time was filled with the wall .
You were focused on the wall , and the wall took precedence of everything else in your life , including your thoughts .
You might have think you were thinking at the post , but instead you were focused on the wall .
Everything in your life works like this .
You might think you ’re doing something , but your real focus is somewhere else .
You think you ’re happy , but instead of real happiness , your focus is in useless , shallow thoughts .
You give to your thinking mind the benefit of reality , instead to give this to your focus .
You might spend your entire life thinking you ’re doing just fine , but your focus will be on a wall .
You ’ll be in fact experiencing a wall , not a happy life .
This is why learning how to train your focus is far more than a productivity technique .
At a certain level , focus mastering is a magical endeavor , is an esoteric , almost secret art .
The one who masters his focus will master his own world .
Are you with me here ?
Or are your drifting away ?
Armenian Americans descended from victims of the 1915 - 18 massacre by Ottoman Turks ca n’t sue foreign insurance companies for unpaid claims because the U.S. government does n’t legally recognize that an Armenian genocide occurred , a federal appeals court ruled Thursday .
A Glendale priest and thousands of other Armenians whose relatives were among the 1.2 million killed had won a partial victory two years ago .
U.S. District Judge Christina A. Snyder said then that a 2000 law passed by the California Legislature gave the descendants standing to sue three German insurance companies .
But a divided three - judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned that ruling , saying the California law attempted to undercut the president ’s diplomatic authority and had to be preempted by the federal policy against acknowledging the genocide .
Congress has considered resolutions three times in the last decade that would have provided official recognition of the genocide .
Each time , the White House has stepped in to urge that the bills be scuttled , out of fear that passage would damage relations with Turkey , whose government disputes that a genocide took place .

“ I think the decision is outrageous .
If taken to its logical extension , what this decision means is that all 40 states that have recognized the Armenian genocide have to set aside that recognition , ” said Brian S. Kabateck , a Los Angeles lawyer representing the plaintiffs whose own maternal grandparents died in the genocide .
“ This is a sad day for Armenian Americans , ” he said , adding that the decision would make recovery of victims ’ bank accounts , insurance proceeds and other property impossible .
He vowed to appeal for rehearing by a larger panel of judges .
Vartkes Yeghiayan , the lawyer for lead plaintiff Father Vazken Movsesian of St. Peter Armenian Church , described the ruling as “ devastating . ”
The attorney representing the German insurers , Neil M. Soltman , called the decision “ a straight - down - the - middle determination that in the area of foreign affairs , federal power has to prevail . ”

Judge Harry Pregerson dissented from the majority opinion by Judges David R. Thompson and Dorothy W. Nelson .
Pregerson wrote that the District Court had correctly judged the California statute as “ within the state ’s traditional area of competence ” in regulating the insurance industry .
The plaintiffs sought settlement of claims under policies issued by German insurers Victoria Versicherung and Ergo Versicherungsgruppe , as well as their parent company , Munchener Ruckversicherungsgesellschaft .

Bernanke , Geithner , and others have stated the biggest mistake in this depression was the failure to rescue Lehman .
I have long disagreed , instead declaring the Bankruptcy of Lehman was one of the few things the Fed got right , even if by accident .
Ambrose Evans - Pritchard has similar thoughts in Lehman is a footnote in the great East - West globalisation crisis .
As my colleague Jeremy Warner puts it , Lehman no more caused the economic convulsions of the last year than the assassination of an Austrian prince caused the First World War .
There was the little matter of a rising Germany then , and a rising China now .
Both scrambled the international system , albeit in different ways .
As of last week , the ABX index of sub - prime mortgage debt showed that AAA - rated securities from early 2007 were trading at 28 cents on the dollar – AA was at 4 cents , near all - time lows .
No one can say that $ 2 trillion ( £ 1.2 trillion ) of sub - prime and Alt - A debt is still trading at panic levels , exaggerating losses .
The dust has settled .
What we can see is that creditors will never recoup their money .
Foreclosures reached 358,000 in August alone .
More Americans are being evicted each month than during the entire Depression year of 1932 .
We know why the bubble occurred .
Call its Greenspanism .
Central banks rescued assets each time there was a hiccup , but let booms run unchecked .
They pulled " real " rates ever lower , creating addiction to monetary stimulus .
Larger doses were required with each cycle , until we hit zero , and it is still not enough .
Debt burdens rose to records across the OECD .
Could n't they see that this was cheating : stealing from the future ?
No , they were seduced by " inflation targeting " – watch goods , ignore assets – just as cheap imports from China rendered the doctrine obsolete .
It always takes ideology to consummate massive error .
China is trying to plug the gap , belatedly , by ramping up credit 70 pc this year , but it will take a cultural revolution to induce the Chinese to spend .
The liquidity is leaking into stocks , metals , and property .
The Great Game can continue only as long as deficit countries – currently , US ( - $ 628bn ) , Spain ( - $ 109bn ) , Italy ( - $ 62bn ) , France ( - $ 58bn ) , Britain ( - $ 53bn ) , Greece ( - $ 42bn ) , and east Europe – are willing to bankrupt themselves buying Asian goods .
Obviously , this is absurd .
Gary Whitta , the former editor - in - chief of PC Gamer who made waves last week when he announced that was " finished " with PC gaming after a hardware crash ( only to later tell us that he since rethought his stance to neutral ) , has announced that he no longer the writer on the Warcraft movie .
Whitta , in a post to the gaming forum Quarter To Three said that he had been working with Legendary Pictures and Blizzard for the past two years on the screenplay .
However , with the announcement yesterday that Spider - Man director Sam Raimi was taking over the project , Whitta revealed that he was no longer on the movie .
" I worked very closely with Legendary and Blizzard to come up with a screenplay that distilled the sprawling Warcraft mythology into a narrative that was easily accessible to the non-player , and everyone was really pleased with the results , " Whitta wrote .
" I personally thought my last draft of the script in particular was really kick - ass and did a good job of introducing the Warcraft world to non-players while also satisfying hardcore players who knew every nook and cranny of the universe .
When Sam expressed interest in the property , however , he had his own pretty specific vision of what he wanted to do story - wise so that 's the version they 're now pursuing .
I 'm no longer involved but I wish them all the best with it ; so far as I 'm concerned Raimi is the best possible director for this .
" It 's not all bad news for Whitta , though .
He 's the writer of Denzel Washington 's upcoming movie The Book of Eli , which is currently in post - production and due out next year .
The movie is about a wanderer in a post - apocalyptic America who must protect the secrets to saving humanity .
The Book of Eli is being directed by Allen and Albert Hughes , the directors of From Hell and Menace II Society .
It also stars Gary Oldman and Mila Kunis .

The new phones will be available on Oct 6th Microsoft is hoping its new mobile phone software , to be launched in October , will revive its fortunes in the market for smart phones .
Analysts estimate Microsoft's Windows Mobile software trails fourth in the market with a 9 % share while rival Symbian dominates with about 50 % .
" Our new class of phones sets us up for the future , " Microsoft 's Stephanie Ferguson told BBC News .
Microsoft would not say how many new phones will feature Windows Mobile 6.5 .
" We do expect to have a lot of momentum using the Windows brand more prominently , " said Ms Ferguson , general manger in the Windows mobile group .
Microsoft 's attempts in the mobile arena have been lame , lame , lame , to say the least
Paul Rubens , Internetnews.com
" It is a brand that customers know and trust and we have n't quite used it as well as we should .
Our research with customers shows when we put Windows phones out there they are highly interested . "
Among the mobile operators signing on are AT&T and Verizon in the US , Orange and T - Mobile in Europe , Telecom Italia Mobile in Latin America and NTT DoCoMo Inc and SK Telecom in Asia Pacific .
Handset makers producing phones powered by the software include LG Electronics , Samsung , Sony Ericsson , HTC , Toshiba Corporation and Acer. ' Lame , lame , lame '
But despite the confident talk , analysts and industry watchers note that Microsoft is not where it would wish to be in the smart phone market .
Technology research firm Gartner said smart phones are the fastest growing segment of the mobile phone market topping 40 million sales and representing a 27 % increase from the same period a year ago .
Apple has sold more than 26 million phones in over 80 markets Analyst company Canalys reported that shipments of devices powered by Windows Mobile fell to 9 % of global smart phone shipments , down from the company 's 14.3 % share in the same period in 2008 and well behind Nokia 's leading share of nearly 45 % .
RIM 's Blackberry commanded 20.9 % .
Apple 's iPhone might demand the majority of headlines but has a 13.7 % market share .
" Despite its domination of desktop and server room operating system sales , Microsoft 's attempts in the mobile arena have been lame , lame , lame , to say the least , " said Paul Rubens of Internetnews.com .
Ned Smith of DigitalMediaBuzz.com defended Windows Mobile as a worthwhile product .
" What gets lost in the hooting and hollering that often overpowers the smart phone conversation , is that Windows Mobile devices are plenty powerful , with ability to run Windows Mobile Office productivity apps such as Word , Excel and PowerPoint .
There 's also a user base well north of 30 million , " noted Mr Smith .

Nine black rhino from KwaZulu - Natal game reserves are being airlifted to a new home as part of a range expansion project for the critically endangered species .
In an effort to ensure the survival of critically endangered black rhino , the World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) and Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife ( EKZNW ) are partnering on a project designed to establish founder populations of black rhino throughout KwaZulu - Natal and other parts of Africa .
The goal of the black rhino ( Diceros bicornis ) expansion project is to stimulate breeding among the animals and increase populations throughout Africa .
According to local news reports , a total of nine rhino will be airlifted to a new home .
So far , eight have already made the journey : Two each from Hluhluwe Game Reserve and the St. Lucia area , and four from the Imfolozi wilderness area .
The destination of the rhino cannot be made public - at least for the time being - due to poaching concerns .
Airlifting ' less stressful ' for rhino
Wildlife authorities say that airlifting is a better choice for the rhino than transporting them on land .
Airlifting is quicker - and thus , less stressful for the animals .
The airlift process starts by identifying a suitable rhino from the air , and darting it with a safe tranquilizer drug .
In about five minutes , the rhino is groggy enough to be roped and and blindfolded .
Once the rhino is safely restrained , the capture team inserts earplugs into the animal 's ears , and rolls it into a large cargo net .
The net is sturdied by a steel frame and cable before being lifted by the helicopter .
The helicopter transports the rhino to the drop - off point , where it is carefully lowered to the ground , to a waiting veterinarian .
The vet performs an examination - and then the unconscious rhino is gently pulled ( using a small truck ) into a crate designed especially for the purpose of moving rhino .
An antidote is administered , and the rhino is transported in its crate to the new destination by truck .
Rhino poaching crisis
The widespread illegal slaughter of black rhino for their horns reduced the population from 65,000 in 1973 to a low of just 2,300 by 1993 .
Sadly , there has been a shocking increase in rhino poaching in the last few years .
Wildlife experts attribute this to rising incomes in China , where demand for the rhino 's horn is insatiable - and trade in endangered species products continues to flourish .
An unfortunate Chinese superstition attributes healing powers to the rhino 's horn , claiming it is a medicine for reducing fever and relieving pain .
( Not as an aphrodisiac , as is widely believed . )
Now that more people can afford expensive and illegal rhino horn , rhino are being slaughtered at an alarming rate .
The illegal trade in rhino horn has become so pervasive that , according to reports , well - organized poaching syndicates are believed to be working with Chinese and Vietnamese nationals throughout Africa to kill rhino and smuggle the horns to Asia .
Today , there are approximately 4,240 black rhinos - thanks to conservation efforts .

MOBILE , Ala . --
An internationally known arms dealer has been charged in a Mobile , Ala . - based case with trying to supply U.S. jet fighter engines to Iran in violation of U.S. prohibitions .
Jacques Monsieur is being held at the Baldwin County correctional center in Bay Minette , Ala .
A Belgian citizen with a documented history of arms sales to Third World dictators , Monsieur was arrested Friday when his plane landed in New York City .
He made a court appearance this afternoon in Mobile , where U.S. Magistrate Judge Katherine " Kit " Nelson ordered him detained and scheduled his arraignment for next week .
The charges stem from an eight - month investigation led by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents based in Mobile .
The six - count indictment handed down last week by a grand jury accuses Monsieur and co-defendant Dara Fotouhi -- an Iranian currently living in France -- with conspiracy , money laundering , smuggling and violations of the Arms Export Control Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act .
• Read the entire six - count indictment .
Federal investigators describe the defendants as experienced arms dealers who have been actively working with the Iranian government to obtain military items .
In February , the indictment alleges , Monsieur began having regular e-mail contact with an undercover agent seeking engines for the F - 5 fighter jet or the C - 130 military transport plane .
" The facts alleged in this indictment underscore the global reach of Iranian procurement networks and the international arms traffickers who help supply them " Deputy Attorney General David Ogden said from Washington .
" This case also highlights the importance of keeping restricted U.S. weapons technology out of their grasp . "
Under the terms of the U.S. trade embargo with Iran , such items may not be exported there without express permission from the U.S. government .
Authorities say Monsieur allegedly planned to hide the engines ' true destination by claiming they were being sent to Colombia instead of Iran .
In July , according to court papers , Monsieur contacted an undercover agent offering $ 110,000 for jet parts and a $ 300,000 down payment for two of the fighter jet engines .
In a 2002 report , the Center for Public Integrity alleged that Monsieur once tried to sell uranium to Iran and to blackmail the French government :
That middleman , Jacques Monsieur , was not the sort of man to write off his losses .
Believed to be among the biggest arms traffickers in Europe , Monsieur had violated a United Nations embargo by shipping arms to Bosnia and Croatia during the long bloody conflict in those countries , with the approval , he later claimed , of both the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Direction de Surveillance de Territoire ( DST ) , the French domestic intelligence service .
He later forfeited his good relations with Washington by acting as an importer - exporter of arms for the Islamic Republic of Iran , for whom he also tried to procure uranium .
He worked closely with executives from the French oil giant , Elf Aquitaine , the state - owned petroleum company that , until its merger with TotalFina in 2000 to form TotalFinaElf , was the sixth largest oil producer in the world .
Though he had aroused the ire of U.S. government officials and was under investigation by French and Belgian law enforcement authorities , Monsieur lived openly in France , all the while violating international sanctions by shipping arms to war - torn countries .

Breakthrough in the lab offers hope of colour blindness cure to millions
Scientists have cured colour blindness in monkeys in a world first .
As well as allowing colour - blind humans to tell red from green , the innovative technique could restore sight to the blind .
Sufferers of age - related macular degeneration - the most common cause of blindness in the elderly - are among the millions who could eventually benefit .
Squirrel monkeys underwent computerised tests for human colour blindness , in which colored numbers or symbols are hidden in a pattern of dot
Researcher Jay Neitz said : ' If we could find a way to do this with complete safety in human eyes , as we did with monkeys , there would be a lot of people who would want it .
' We hope the technology will be useful in correcting a lot of different vision disorders . '
Professor Neitz used gene therapy - injections of genes - to allow two male squirrel monkeys called Sam and Dalton to see in full colour for the first time .
Like some humans with red - green colour blindness , the monkeys lacked a pigment that the cones - the colour - detector cells at the back of the eye - need to see red and green .
As a result , they saw both red and green as shades of grey .
Other colours , such as orange , blue and brown appeared washed - out .
To fix their vision , the U.S. scientists injected their eyes with millions of copies of a gene needed to make the missing pigment , the journal Nature reports .
Importantly , the monkeys were injected with a human gene , suggesting the same technique would work on people .
Four months later , their vision suddenly improved .
Professor Neitz , of the University of Washington in Seattle , said : ' It was as if they woke up and saw these new colours .
They unquestionably responded to colours that had been invisible to them . '
A version of the colour blindness test that is used in schools around the world showed just how much their vision has improved .
Dr Katherine Mancuso , the study 's lead author , said : ' Their performance on red and green was similar , but not quite as good , as a female monkey who had normal colour vision since birth . '
But the need to prove that adding genes to the body does not cause harmful side - effects means it will be some time before the method is routinely used to correct colour blindness .
Despite this , the researchers are optimistic and point out that gene therapy is already being tested on Britons and Americans with a rare , hereditary form of blindness called Leber 's congenital amaurosis .
The technique could also be adapted to treat other conditions that involve problems with genes in the colour and detail - detecting cone cells at the back of the eye .
These include age - related macular degeneration , in which deterioration of central vision makes it increasingly difficult to carry out everyday tasks such as reading and driving .
Blindness linked to diabetes might also be treated .
Cathy Yelf , of the Macular Disease Society , said the research was ' very interesting ' but cautioned : ' A practical gene therapy for macular degeneration is still some way off . '
Jay - Z’s latest video called Run This Town ( featuring Rihanna and Kanye West ) contains occult symbolism relating to secret societies .
It has been long rumored that Jay - Z is part of some sort of occult order ( probably Freemasonry ) due to the hints slipped in his songs and his imagery .
Run This Town certainly adds fuel to the fire .
We ’ll look at the symbolism in this song and in his clothing line , Rocawear .
I ’m pretty sure Jay - Z does it on purpose and that he appreciates the attention it gets him .
He has been steadily displaying occult symbolism in his songs , videos and in the designs of his Rocawear clothing line .
The Brooklyn rapper has lately been associating himself with Freemasonry , Illuminati and other orders .
Is he now initiated in one of those Brotherhoods and eager to show it off ?
Why does he appear in other videos containing occult meanings ( see Rihanna ’s Umbrella or Beyonce ’s Crazy in Love ) ?
The video to Run This Town was directed by Anthony Mandler , who also did Rihanna ’s Disturbia video .
The least we can say is that Mandler certainly knows how to insert dark symbolism into a video .
“ Do What Thou Wilt ”
Before we get into the video , a couple of things need to be explained in order to understand Jay - Z ’s mindset and where he gets his ideas from .
The symbols that will be discussed in this article ca n’t be coincidences or a collection of random items .
Jay - Z draws his inspiration from specific sources and associates with like - minded people ( director Anthony Mandler ) to integrate those ideas .
A telling example can be found in the second trailer video for “ Run This Town ” .
We see Jay - Z explaining the concept of the video while wearing a black hoodie bearing the saying “ Do What Thou Wilt ” .
“ Do What Thou Wilt ” is the official dictum of the Ordo Templi Orientis ( O.T.O. ) and of its reformer , occultist Aleister Crowley .
The O.T.O. is a hermetic order modeled after Freemasonry and German Illuminism and teaches its initiates the secrets of the Mysteries , Gnosticism , sex magick , Kaballah and other occult sciences .
Contrarily to Freemasonry , the O.T.O. is however based on the “ Law of Thelema ” which main precept is “ Do What Thou Wilt be the whole of the Law “ .
Although this saying was interpreted in different ways , most agree that it refers to the dismissal of conventional moral and ethical rules in order to find one ’s “ True Will ” .
In other words , the usual guidelines by which good and evil are determined to have to be blurred and forgotten to obtain the true path to illumination .
Crowley explains this notion rather clearly here :
“ There are no “ standards of Right ” .
Ethics is balderdash .
Each Star must go on its own orbit .
To hell with “ moral principle ” ; there is no such thing ”
– Crowley , Aleister .
The Old and New Commentaries to Liber AL , II,28 .
Although not officially considered “ satanic ” , the O.T.O. does fully embrace the Luciferian doctrine ( see Crowley ’s poem “ Hymn to Lucifer ) and its high - level members are referred to as “ Most Illuminated and Most Puissant Baphomet ” .
Baphomet is , of course , the horned androgynous idol of Western Occultism .
Is Jay - Z part of the O.T.O. or does he just like that shirt ?
Do n’t know .
We will , however , see that he is very educated in the field of occult symbolism and that he enjoys hinting people that he associates with the Brotherhood .
Here ’s the video .
“ Run This Town ” Analysis
So this is the video at face value : Jay - Z , Rihanna , and Kanye West are performing in front of an angry mob , which is apparently out to overthrow the current order of things and thus “ Run This Town ” .
The aesthetics of the video are reminiscent of movements led by rebel factions in third world African or Latino countries .
When one listens closely to the lyrics , however , something seems to be “ off ” .
Jay - Z and Kanye are mainly rapping about how rich and famous they are and are describing bourgeoisie luxuries such as Maison Martin Margiela clothes , bottles of Riesling and Maybach cars .
This is n’t exactly the type of speech Che Guevara would give .
Despite the looks , the artists are n’t quite revolutionary , they can even be considered pro-establishment .
Is this a political rebellion or could it be philosophical / spiritual ?
The visuals of the video hint a second , occult meaning to the song .
At the beginning of the video , a man hands a lit torch to Rihanna who holds it up in the air .
This symbolic gesture sums up perfectly the concept of the video .
Anybody vaguely familiar with occultism can easily associate the symbol of the lit torch held high to Lucifer a .k.a. the Light Bearer .
Most occult orders secretly acknowledge Lucifer as being the savior of humanity , the fallen angel who liberated men from the oppression of the biblical God ( Jehovah , Yahweh ) .
These orders ( the main one being Freemasonry ) have been working for centuries towards the overthrow of the rule of organized religions to usher in a new age or a “ New Order ” .
At the philosophical center of this order : the Luciferian Doctrine , where men are free to become gods by their own means .
The Torch of Illumination is the ultimate symbol of this philosophy and can be found in many instances ( see Statue of Liberty , a gift from French Freemasons ) .
The goal of the Illuminist has been put in plain in simple words : they are dedicated to the “ coming forth of the conquering light “ .
“ Run This Town ” visually represents this aim in a clear way for the initiates yet concealed for the profane .
Consequently , the video contains a second level of interpretation : “ Run This Town ” is an announcement of the coming of a New World Order , lead by secret ( Luciferian ) societies .
Rihanna ’s ominous intro explains how it is going down .
Feeling it coming in the air , hear the screams from everywhere , I ’m addicted to thrill , Its a dangerous love affair , Ca n’t be scared when it goes down , got a problem tell me now ,
Only thing that ’s on my mind is who gon run this town tonight , who gon run this town tonite
Rihanna ’s lyrics are announcing an imminent change that might terrify or enrage some people ( “ hear the screams from everywhere “ ) .
The torches hint to a new spiritual and philosophical era where Lucifer is king .
She is “ addicted to the thrill ” of being on the dark side and she knows that dealing with it is a “ dangerous love affair “ .
But regardless of all of this , it all comes down to control , hence “ Only thing that ’s on my mind is who gon run this town tonight “ .
Then Jay - Z comes along and announces the coming of “ Roc Nation ” ( Roc being a diminutive of Rocafella , the name of his record label , which is based on the elite family Rockefeller ) .
We are , yeah , I said it , we are This is Roc Nation , pledge your allegiance
Get y’all fatigues on , all black everything Black cards , black cars , all black everything And our girls are blackbirds , riding with they Dillingers I get more in - depth if you boys really real enough This is La Familia , I ’ll explain later But for now , let me get back to this paper I ’m a couple bands down and I ’m tryna get back I gave Doug a grip , I lost a flip for five stacks Yeah , I ’m talking five comma six zeroes dot zero ?
Back to running circles ’ round n----s , now we squared up
Jay - Z is asking you to “ Pledge your allegiance ” to the new ruler and to wear black everything to honor him .
Jay ’s lyrics contain hints to Freemasonry that are hidden in the double meaning of some lines .
“ I gave Doug a grip ” means he gave Doug a stack of money but the double meaning of that line would refer to the Masons ’ secret handshakes which are called “ grips ” .
And who is Doug ?
Might be Doug Morris .
The last line of his first verse is “ Back to running circles ’ round n----s , now we squared up “ .
Aside from its obvious meaning , it also refers to the important Masonic concept of “ squaring the circle ” , which is way too deep to explain here ( “ I get more in - depth if you boys really real enough “ ) .
In the second verse , Jay - Z says “ It ’s the return of thee god “ , which refers to the Luciferian belief of men being gods .
This term is often used in NY slang and originates from the fact that many rappers were Five - Percenters , a philosophy based on the belief that all men are gods .
Further in the song , Jay - Z says : “ I ’m in Maison , ugh , Martin Margiela ” which is an upper - end fashion store .
English speaking people usually pronounce the French word “ Maison ” to sound like “ mayzaun ” .
Jay - Z , however , says it to sound like “ Mason ” as in “ Freemason ” .
There is an obvious double - meaning here meant to catch the ear of the listener .
He basically says “ I ’m in Mason ” to make people say “ huh did he really say that ? ” as “ I ’m a Freemason ” but he then continues by saying “ ugh , Martin Margiela “ .
The little pause after he says those words accentuate the effect .
Then Rihanna comes back with the chorus .
Life ’s a game but it ’s not fair I break the rules so I do n’t care
So I keep doing my own thing Walking tall against the rain Victory ’s within the mile Almost there , do n’t give up now Only thing that ’s on my mind
Is who gon ’ run this town tonight
She says that the game of life is corrupted but she still succeeds because she “ breaks the rules ” .
In other words , she ignores the boundaries between good and evil to achieve her goals .
This might remind you of the saying “ Do What Thou Wilt ” of the Ordo Templi Orientis described above .
Those lines refer to her as a person and also to the Order as a whole , who is prepared to commit the most horrible acts to reach its goals .
“ Victory ’s within the mile ” means that the realization of the New World Order is at its final stages and that the Illuminati - sponsored revolution is about to happen .
So “ Run This Town ” contains obvious hints leading towards Luciferian philosophy and occult orders .
The fire of Lucifer ’s torch esoterically represents divine knowledge and wisdom brought to men .
Fire in this vi , however , wever a destructive force .
What type of knowledge are we giving these rebellious people , who represent the masses of fans ?
Jay - Z and Occult Symbolism
Jay - Z’s clothing line “ Rocawear ” has incorporated obvious occult symbols in its designs .
Some are so blatantly Masonic that he probably could n’t get away with it if he was n’t effectively implicated with them .
In interviews , Jay - Z has said to be actively involved in the choices of designs of his clothing line .
Here are some examples :
The logo above is designed to look like the Eye of Horus below .
Prodigy ’s Crusade
Rapper Prodigy from the mythical group Mobb Deep has occasionally denounced Jay - Z ’s affiliation with the Illuminati in the last years .
Here ’s an URB article on the subject .
Like he does in his monthly blog on Vibe.com , the incarcerated Prodigy recently spewed more of his conspiracy theories via a handwritten letter to URB .
This time , he reveals the moment his eyes were opened to the sham he calls “ the government , religions , politics , the Federal Reserve , and I.R.S. ” According to P , in 1996 , after reading a book by Dr. Malichi Z. York titled Leviathan 666 , he was moved so much , he cried , and that was his “ moment of clarity . ”
“ I was crying for all of humanity , but mostly for my black people ’ cause I then realized it was all a sham , ” Prodigy writes in his letter to URB .
“ The government , religions , politics , the Federal Reserve , the I.R.S. , and everything that we believe and live by is a joke . ”
Even worse , the rapper says that many popular rappers are aware of these society secrets , but choose not to speak on it for fear of not being accepted by corporate America .
One , in particular , is Jay - Z. Occult Secrets of Jay Z , Kanye & Nas “ J.Z. knows the truth , but he chose sides with evil in order to be accepted in the corporate world .
J.Z. conceals the truth from the black community and the world , and promotes the lifestyle of the beast instead , ” he wrote .
Prodigy says that Jay grew up grew up in Dr. York ’s “ Nuwabian ” community in Brooklyn as a kid , and is “ aware ” of these evils — rogue government , elitists running the country , etc .
Because of Jay’z refusal to speak on the topics Prodigy has been doing so since his incarceration , he will make it a point to wage war against him .
“ J.Z is a God damn lie .
I have so much fire in my heart that I will relentlessly attack J.Z , Illuminati , and any - every other evil that exists until my lights are put out , ” P writes .
“ This negativity I speak of is an actual living entity that uses us as food .
We must sever ties with it in order to see things for what they really are .
This negative energy is created and harnessed by the Illuminati secret government and they will make you spread this energy without you even knowing it .
But people like J.Z. are very well aware .
He was schooled by Dr. York , ” he continued .
Real talk .
In Conclusion
So , the least we can say is that Jay - Z has “ affinities ” with occultism and secret societies .
“ Run This Town ” only adds to the suspicions surrounding him due to the symbolism and philosophy displayed in the video .
In light of those facts , some questions arise : has Jay - Z sided with the elite to succeed in the corporate world ?
Is he used to promote NWO agenda ?
Or is this an act to fuel rumors and to add a little “ mystique ” around his persona ?
Maybe it ’s all of the above .
Maybe he ’s doing this to get people like me writing and to generate buzz around his latest album .
If this article has promoted Jay - Z , so be it .
At least people will know what the they ’re saluting when they ’re throwing up that Roc sign .

Greetings Readers !
The streaming video market has become rather crowded in the last couple of years with services like Hulu and YouTube , but the video service with the most potential is Amazon ’s VOD service .
Amazon ’s VOD ( Video On Demand ) service has been around for a while and has a huge library of tv shows and movies including some of the newest releases yet it has never gained much traction in a world dominated by Netflix .
If Amazon hopes to really compete in this market , it needs to do more than advertise its service ( which it does n’t do a very good job at anyway ) .
Amazon needs to through its weight behind the service and make sure that everybody is aware of it and it is accessible as possible .
How can they make it accessible ?
Amazon needs more distribution deals with hardware manufactures .
Amazon currently has deals which allow its service to be accessed on Roku boxes , Panasonic Blu-ray players , TiVo DVRs and Sony Bravia TVs , but they have to do much better than that .
Amazon needs to push for a deal with every TV manufacture instead of just Sony and their Bravia line .
With many people upgrading to new and better TVs after the DTV transition to take advantage of the new HD content , there is a huge opportunity for Amazon if they work to put themselves on all internet connected TVs .
Same thing with Blu-ray players , Blu-ray is starting to gain traction and Amazon needs to do its best to get on more than just Panasonic players if it wants to get in on the ground floor before the mass exodus from DVD to Blu-ray begins .
As far as TiVo goes , that is a great move for them but they should also work towards being on the DVRs offered by cable and satellite providers .
Amazon has the huge opportunity to grab a huge chunk of the streaming video market if they are willing to do what is necessary to put their service in front of as many people as possible .
They have started moving in this direction , but so as Netflix and others , so if they want to put themselves in a dominant position , they must act now !
Finally , I think they need to go mobile with their video on demand service .
Apps for the iPhone , Android , Windows Mobile and such should be coming too .
Many people like to watch videos on their phones , so if you have a way to stream videos to a phone , even if it is over wifi , you are ahead of the competition .
The competition in this space is in its very early stages and Amazon is on the position of either being left behind or taking the lead .
The potential for profit is there , will they strike before its too late ?
CONCORD , N.C. -- Tony Stewart crossed the finish line for his first victory as a car owner and made some rapid - fire decisions .
No , he would not climb the Lowe 's Motor Speedway fence in celebration .
Tony Stewart became the first driver / owner to win the All - Star race since Geoff Bodine in 1994 .
Jarrett / Getty Images
No , he would not go to his beloved Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Sunday to watch -- or participate -- in the final day of qualifying for the Indianapolis 500 .
The only thing Stewart had in mind was a long night of celebrating the first victory for Stewart - Haas Racing on Saturday night in the $ 1 million All - Star event .
" I do n't even know if I 'll be conscious tomorrow , " he joked .
" We 're going to start an over / under to see what time I actually wake up , and then you guys might want to start a second pool to see what time I actually climb out of bed .
So , no , I am not going to Indy .
" I do n't know what day this day is actually going to end .
I would like to go .
And I am sure at some point tomorrow -- thank God for Tivo , lets put it that way -- I 'll at least see what happened at some point . "
Stewart passed Matt Kenseth with two laps to go in a thrilling final 10 - lap shootout to win for the first time in 11 All - Star event starts .
It was the first victory since he left Joe Gibbs Racing at the end of last year , after two championships and 10 successful seasons , to become co-owner of Stewart - Haas Racing .
In just six months , Smoke has turned his new toy into a championship contender .
He came into the race second in the Sprint Cup Series standings -- surprising because most people predicted a rocky first year for a driver accustomed to winning .
Instead , he 's put both himself and teammate Ryan Newman ( eighth in points ) in position for berths in the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship .
Both have been closing in on Victory Lane , and Stewart won the race to give the organization its first victory dating to its 2002 debut as Haas CNC Racing .
Matt Damon Flips Out On Adrian Grenier During PSA Filming

The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
A new video has surfaced on YouTube featuring Matt Damon losing his cool with Adrian Grenier during a PSA shoot for the organization OneXOne .
It ’s been known for months now that Damon would have a guest appearance on Entourage promoting his clean water organization — but we ’re not exactly sure if this is part of that scene , a funny outtake , or something more serious .
Of course , many of you are rolling your eyes at this moment — simply because this is n’t the first time Damon has pulled off pissed off .
Back in 2006 , the 38 - year - old actor made a scene at the end of Jimmy Kimmel Live when he was cut - off from appearing at the end .
It was hilarious — and so believable , that some people thought it was real .
Anyways , in this clip , we see some of the actors from Entourage in the background — including Jeremy Piven ( who appears very much in character ) and Kevin Connolly .
Grenier keeps stumbling over his lines for the PSA and Damon keeps getting frustrated and eventually blows up .
The only thing that ’s odd is that at one point Damon calls Grenier by his real name — and not his character ’s .
And Adrian asks at one point if he should do it as himself or as Vince .
Anyways , we ’re going with well done , but fake .
What do you think ?

The Bundeswehr 's Afghan Nightmare How the Taliban Are Taking Control of Kunduz
Six years ago , German soldiers came to Afghanistan 's Kunduz province to carry out reconstruction work .
Now they are engaged in a bitter struggle with the resurgent Taliban , who are trying to sabotage Thursday 's presidential election .
Many local people no longer believe the Europeans can help them .
This package provides first class labels that can act as bidirectional record fields .
The labels can be derived automatically using Template Haskell which means you do n't have to write any boilerplate yourself .
The labels are implemented as lenses and are fully composable .
Lenses can be used to get , set and modify parts of a data type in a consistent way .
See Data .
Label for an introductory explanation or see the introductory blog post at http://fvisser.nl/post/2013/okt/1/fclabels-2.0.html
Total and partial lenses
Internally lenses do not used Haskell functions directly , but are implemented as categories .
Categories allow the lenses to be run in custom computational contexts .
This approach allows us to make partial lenses that point to fields of multi-constructor datatypes in an elegant way .
See Data .
Label .
Partial for the use of partial labels .
Monomorphic and polymorphic lenses
We have both polymorphic and monomorphic lenses .
Polymorphic lenses allow updates that change the type .
The types of polymorphic lenses are slightly more verbose than their monomorphic counterparts , but their usage is similar .
Because monomorphic lenses are built by restricting the types of polymorphic lenses they are essentially the same and can be freely composed with eachother .
See Data.Label .Mono and Data .Label .
Poly for the difference between polymorphic and monomorphic lenses .
Using fclabels
To simplify working with labels we supply both a set of labels for Haskell 's base types , like lists , tuples , Maybe and Either , and we supply a set of combinators for working with labels for values in the Reader and State monad .
See Data.Label .Base and Data.Label .Monadic for more information .

Why do you read this blog ?
What other media sources do you consume ?
If information were food , how healthy is your diet ?
If information sources were investments , what does your portfolio allocation look like and how is it “ performing ? ”
As a reader of this blog , you are likely an investor , trader , money manager or curious observer of financial markets .
If you do not recognize that your information diet has a significant impact on your financial success , you have either suffered in some financial way or you will suffer at some point in the not - too - distant future … whether you realize it or not .
… in an information - rich world , the wealth of information means a dearth of something else : a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes .
What information consumes is rather obvious : it consumes the attention of its recipients .
Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it .
~ Herbert Simon ( 1916 – 2001 )
Herbert Simon , author of the preceding quote , is probably best known for his work with ( and coining the phrase ) , bounded rationality , which is a concept that suggests that individuals are only partially rational and that their rationality is bound by the information they consume , the complexity and abundance of the information available to them and the finite amount of time they have to make decisions .
As Simon suggests in the preceding quote , “ a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention . ”
Today ’s tremendous abundance and velocity of information does not make consumers more equipped to make rational decisions — it has a constricting effect upon the bounds of rationality .
More information , however , does allow for greater knowledge and decision - making capacity ( the operative word being capacity ) — it just does not , by default , translate into better judgment .
In other words , the consumer of information , to efficiently transform information into knowledge and knowledge into optimal decision - making capacity , the consumer must mindfully and efficiently allocate their attention among select sources of information or otherwise risk their attention being consumed ( and rationality further bound ) by the information .
In other words , with regard to information , one must either be a mindful consumer or be consumed .
Of course , one may also mindfully select sources of information purely for entertainment purposes .
It is important , however , that the consumer understand the difference between entertainment and fact - based information .
Making mindful information consumption more challenging , the former often pretends to be the latter .
What information sources do you consume ?
What does your “ media portfolio allocation ” look like ?
Do you seek sources of information that only align with your perspective ( confirmation bias ) or do you seek a variety of opinion ?

Added sugars , which are sprinkled on and processed into packaged foods and beverages , have become all too common in the American diet , says the American Heart Association .
The group argues that sugar bingeing is helping drive the uptick in metabolic changes in the American population , including the exploding obesity rate , and has now recommended an upper limit on daily consumption .
Women should consume no more than 100 calories per day of added sugars , and men should not top 150 calories per day .
There goes the soda habit :
One 12 - ounce can contains about 8 teaspoons or about 33 grams of added sugar , which equals approximately 130 calories , notes the AHA .
( One gram of sugar serves up 4 calories , according to the American Dietetic Association . )
With math like that , it 's not surprising that the average American rings up an average of 22.2 teaspoons , or 355 calories per day , of added sugars , mostly from sugar - sweetened beverages .
But those who shun sweet - tasting drinks are not off the hook .
Part of the challenge of avoiding added sugars , argues the AHA , is that they have become far more prevalent over time ; the amount of added sugars in Americans ' food options increased 19 percent between 1970 and 2005 .
Here are 11 sneaky dietary sources that are surprisingly high in added sugars :
Fortune cookies .
Just one fortune cookie packs about 3.6 grams of added sugar .
Flavored booze .
Exercise good judgment when you drink :
One ounce of crème de menthe has 14 grams of added sugar ; 53 - proof coffee - flavored liqueur has 16 grams of added sugar per ounce .
Baked beans .
A one - cup serving of canned baked beans with no salt added will cost you nearly 15 grams of added sugar .
Dried , sweetened cranberries .
Without the sweetener , this fruit can be incredibly tart .
But one serving — a third of a cup — of this treat will hit you with 25 grams of added sugar .
Ketchup .
A favorite condiment , a single one - cup serving of regular — or low sodium — ketchup racks up nearly 40 grams of added sugar .
Cream substitutes .
A one - cup serving of a liquid " light " cream substitute packs 22 grams of added sugar , while a one - cup serving of a powdered " light " cream substitute adds a whopping 69 grams .
BBQ sauce .
A one - cup serving of this summertime favorite adds 9 grams of added sugar onto those ribs and chicken .
" Reduced " salad dressings .
A one - cup serving of reduced - calorie French dressing heaps 58 grams of added sugar , and a one - cup serving of reduced - fat coleslaw dressing hits a home run with 103 grams of added sugar .
Lemonade .
A cup of lemonade powder has a massive 200 grams of added sugar .
A single serving of the drink has almost 17 grams of added sugar .
Flavored popcorn .
Think the added sweetener can't be that bad here ?
Fat - free - syrup caramel popcorn has 18 grams of added sugar per ounce serving .
I ’m a pretty die hard Sonic fan – just ask Heretic .
Naturally I was excited to see that one of my favorite games of all time is back !
Sega Vintage collection has graced us with the release of Sonic and Knuckles for Xbox Live Arcade .
The game is just like how we remember it .
For all you noobies , ( anyone born after 1994 ) Sonic and Knuckles were adversaries in the past games .
In Sonic and Knuckles , Knuckles realizes that he was just Dr. Robotniks bitch .
I do n’t call him Dr Eggman because that ’d be stupid .
Now , Knuckles teams up with our ADHD filled friend to battle this common foe and acquire the master emerald to save their home land of Angel Island .
At its core the game has been left alone , thank the gaming gods for that one .
we still get our side scrolling goodness that made us love the series way back in the day .
Yes , there was a time when Sonic the Hedgehog was better than Super Mario .
That ’s right I said it .
The graphics are classic Genesis greatness , none of this HD fancy pantsy stuff .
This is from a time when games relied on actual gameplay rather than the pizazz of graphics .
The environments are large with more than one way to get from point A to point B , adding a lot of extra game time .
The sprites are still from Sonic 3 but that ’s ok , why fix something if it is n’t broken ?
The sounds of yesteryear are here with a little added clarity .
There is something about the chime of the rings that sends me to my warm and happy place .
Back in the day I used play games on a mono speaker TV , sad I know .
Now that I have full surround sound all the classics just sound awesome .
Sorry got a little emotional there for a second , i’m just glad to see Sonic being so awesome again .
The gameplay is classic Sonic .
Sonic and Knuckles uses the same engine as Sonic 3 with a few additions .
In 1994 everything had to be updated to make Knuckles work in the Sonic universe .
As we know he can glyde , climb at will and also run through certain block walls .
This was a big deal back then but now , not so much .
Sorry kiddies , you just had to be there to appreciate it .
Sonic and Knuckles has always been a solid game and the re-release of this great title promotes that statement even more , and it ’s still a blast to play .
What really makes this game so great on XBLA is that we also get Sonic 3 and Knuckles , Knuckles in Sonic 2 , and Blue Sphere .
This download is Achievement whore friendly .
I earned 5 achievements in less than twenty minutes .
If you ’re a Sonic fan , this game should be in your virtual library .
For 400 Microsoft points you ca n’t go wrong , especially when you ’re given three other games to go with it .
‘ Nuff said .
Make $ 100 the sleazy way
MLB has supported breast cancer research for years .
But no good deed goes unpunished .
Are you a male who'd like to make $ 100 the sleazy way ?
Then I have a deal for you , but you have to act by June 25 .
Of course , you 'll have to cash in your basic moral decency to do it and incur the wrath of every woman in your life -- including your mom -- and feel worse about yourself than Sanjaya 's barber .
But we 're talking $ 100 !
Here 's how to do it , but I would n't let the wife read this :
It so happens that on May 8 , 2004 , the Oakland A's had a Mother 's Day promotion .
There was a fight - breast - cancer 5 K run before the game , free mammograms and the first 7,500 women through the gate got floppy plaid sun hats from Macy's .
Nice day for the ladies .
Except that last part really hacked off a man named Alfred G. Rava .
He was incensed that men were n't getting a floppy plaid sun hat for Mother 's Day .
He was so mad about it that he sued .
It gets worse .
He has nearly won .
A judge has given preliminary approval to a $ 510,000 settlement -- roughly half to lawyers and the rest to the " victims " -- the poor , downtrodden gender - disadvantaged waifs like Rava who did n't get their floppy Mother 's Day hats .
This is where you come in .
If you can prove you were one of the first 7,500 people there that day , you get $ 50 in cash , two - for - one A's tickets and a $ 25 Macy 's coupon .
It wo n't be hard .
All you have to do is ( A ) state under oath that you are a male , ( B ) show some kind of receipt for your ticket and ( C ) swear you were there early .
That 's good enough .
There 's no video , and nobody 's going to spend $ 5,000 deposing you about $ 100 .
" The entire settlement should be donated to the Breast Care Center at UCSF , " says A's fan Ben Huber .
" No good deed goes unpunished . "
So how many guys have lined up to get their rightful floppy - hat - equivalent payment that was stolen from them by those selfish Mother 's Day - manipulating women ?
" Well , I have n't taken a single call so far , " said the 1 - 888 operator at the firm handling claims .
" And I 'm here just about every day . "
A's fans are not just ignoring Rava in droves ; they 're pissed .
" The entire settlement should be donated to the Breast Care Center at UCSF , " says A's fan Ben Huber .
" No good deed goes unpunished . "
Is n't it good to know that most American males still have a spine ?
Save for ( cough , cough ) one .
Turns out Rava is a lawyer .
In fact , this is not his first men-inism lawsuit .
He 's been part of more than 40 male anti-discrimination lawsuits , sometimes as the plaintiff , like in Oakland , and sometimes as the plaintiff 's attorney .
He has sued Club Med for a ladies - only promotion .
He 's sued the Angels for giving away a $ 1.45 tote bag to women in 2005 .
He has sued restaurants and nightclubs and theater companies .
Mr. Rava gets incensed a lot .
Oh , and he does n't even work in Oakland .
He works in San Diego .
Gee , I wonder what a sue - happy lawyer from San Diego would be doing at an A's - Twins game the very day that they were holding a women - only giveaway ?
I called and asked .
But Rava would n't say .
" Season - ticket holder ? " I asked .
Rava would n't say .
" You went to a game on Mother 's Day , to a game that was promoting breast cancer awareness , and you felt victimized by not getting a floppy plaid sun hat ? "
Rava insisted it was a fishing hat .
And he thinks the fact he did n't get one is offensive .
Not just to him , he says , but to the state of California , " which has a very strong policy against discriminating on the basis of sex . "
" Dude ! "
" Look , " Rava says , " if ESPN were giving away free autographed Nolan Ryan baseballs to men only on Father 's Day , would that be fair ? "
" These were n't autographed baseballs .
They were women 's sun hats .
Plaid , floppy sun hats . "
Rava : " Fishing hats . "
I 'm surprised he did n't want his free mammogram , too .
Personally , I find Mr. Rava as odorous as a bag of dyspeptic hamsters .
He 's a greasy manipulator who has found a small leak in American law and stuck an open wallet under it .
When they wrote California 's Unruh Civil Rights
Act in 1959 -- the act Rava cites in his suits -- they never thought soulless creatures like him would someday slink about the earth .
We are not a collection of legal briefs , appellate rulings and city ordinances .
We are people .
We are grandfathers and sisters and uncles and girlfriends , all woven into the fabric of this wonderful thing called sports .
And if once in a while we want to do something nice for each other -- and not want anything for ourselves -- is that so wrong ?
What are you going to do , sue ?
Yes , Al Rava is going to sue and keep suing .
What 's next , Mr. Rava ? Kids ' Helmet Night ?
( Age discrimination ! )
Wheelchairs along the rail with a view ?
( Health discrimination ! ) Mullets Get in Free Day ?
( Clean - hair statutes ! )
Lawyers like Rava suck the fun out of everything .
What 's amazing is that Rava 's own mother died of breast cancer at age 53 .
How would she feel about his crass-action lawsuit ?
" I am sure my mom would be proud of my lawsuit against this major league baseball franchise that denied male and female consumers under 18 years of age free fishing hats based on sex and age , " he says .
Sun hats , tool .

Providence , RI - A new study by researchers at Rhode Island Hospital have found a substantial link between increased levels of nitrates in our environment and food with increased deaths from diseases , including Alzheimer 's , diabetes mellitus and Parkinson's .
The study was published in the Journal of Alzheimer 's Disease ( Volume 17:3 July 2009 ) .
Led by Suzanne de la Monte , MD , MPH , of Rhode Island Hospital , researchers studied the trends in mortality rates due to diseases that are associated with aging , such as diabetes , Alzheimer 's , Parkinson's , diabetes and cerebrovascular disease , as well as HIV .
They found strong parallels between age adjusted increases in death rate from Alzheimer 's , Parkinson's , and diabetes and the progressive increases in human exposure to nitrates , nitrites and nitrosamines through processed and preserved foods as well as fertilizers .
Other diseases including HIV - AIDS , cerebrovascular disease , and leukemia did not exhibit those trends .
De la Monte and the authors propose that the increase in exposure plays a critical role in the cause , development and effects of the pandemic of these insulin - resistant diseases .
De la Monte , who is also a professor of pathology and lab medicine at The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University , says , " We have become a ' nitrosamine generation . '
In essence , we have moved to a diet that is rich in amines and nitrates , which lead to increased nitrosamine production .
We receive increased exposure through the abundant use of nitrate - containing fertilizers for agriculture . "
She continues , " Not only do we consume them in processed foods , but they get into our food supply by leeching from the soil and contaminating water supplies used for crop irrigation , food processing and drinking . "
Nitrites and nitrates belong to a class of chemical compounds that have been found to be harmful to humans and animals .
More than 90 percent of these compounds that have been tested have been determined to be carcinogenic in various organs .
They are found in many food products , including fried bacon , cured meats and cheese products as well as beer and water .
Exposure also occurs through manufacturing and processing of rubber and latex products , as well as fertilizers , pesticides and cosmetics .
Nitrosamines are formed by a chemical reaction between nitrites or other proteins .
Sodium nitrite is deliberately added to meat and fish to prevent toxin production ; it is also used to preserve , color and flavor meats .
Ground beef , cured meats and bacon in particular contain abundant amounts of amines due to their high protein content .
Because of the significant levels of added nitrates and nitrites , nitrosamines are nearly always detectable in these foods .
Nitrosamines are also easily generated under strong acid conditions , such as in the stomach , or at high temperatures associated with frying or flame broiling .
Reducing sodium nitrite content reduces nitrosamine formation in foods .
Nitrosamines basically become highly reactive at the cellular level , which then alters gene expression and causes DNA damage .
The researchers note that the role of nitrosamines has been well - studied , and their role as a carcinogen has been fully documented .
The investigators propose that the cellular alterations that occur as a result of nitrosamine exposure are fundamentally similar to those that occur with aging , as well as Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's and Type 2 diabetes mellitus .
De la Monte comments , " All of these diseases are associated with increased insulin resistance and DNA damage .
Their prevalence rates have all increased radically over the past several decades and show no sign of plateau .
Because there has been a relatively short time interval associated with the dramatic shift in disease incidence and prevalence rates , we believe this is due to exposure - related rather than genetic etiologies . "
The researchers recognize that an increase in death rates is anticipated in higher age groups .
Yet when the researchers compared mortality from Parkinson 's and Alzheimer 's disease among 75 to 84 year olds from 1968 to 2005 , the death rates increased much more dramatically than for cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease , which are also aging - associated .
For example , in Alzheimer 's patients , the death rate increased 150 - fold , from 0 deaths to more than 150 deaths per 100,000 .
Parkinson 's disease death rates also increased across all age groups .
However , mortality rates from cerebrovascular disease in the same age group declined , even though this is a disease associated with aging as well .
De la Monte notes , " Because of the similar trending in nearly all age groups within each disease category , this indicates that these overall trends are not due to an aging population .
This relatively short time interval for such dramatic increases in death rates associated with these diseases is more consistent with exposure - related causes rather than genetic changes . "
She also comments , " Moreover , the strikingly higher and climbing mortality rates in older age brackets suggest that aging and / or longer durations of exposure have greater impacts on progression and severity of these diseases . "
The researchers graphed and analyzed mortality rates , and compared them with increasing age for each disease .
They then studied United States population growth , annual use and consumption of nitrite - containing fertilizers , annual sales at popular fast food chains , and sales for a major meat processing company , as well as consumption of grain and consumption of watermelon and cantaloupe ( the melons were used as a control since they are not typically associated with nitrate or nitrite exposure ) .
The findings indicate that while nitrogen - containing fertilizer consumption increased by 230 percent between 1955 and 2005 , its usage doubled between 1960 and 1980 , which just precedes the insulin - resistant epidemics the researchers found .
They also found that sales from the fast food chain and the meat processing company increased more than 8 - fold from 1970 to 2005 , and grain consumption increased 5 - fold .
The authors state that the time course of the increased prevalence rates of Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's and diabetes cannot be explained on the basis of gene mutations .
They instead mirror the classical trends of exposure - related disease .
Because nitrosamines produce biochemical changes within cells and tissues , it is conceivable that chronic exposure to low levels of nitrites and nitrosamines through processed foods , water and fertilizers is responsible for the current epidemics of these diseases and the increasing mortality rates associated with them .
De la Monte states , " If this hypothesis is correct , potential solutions include eliminating the use of nitrites and nitrates in food processing , preservation and agriculture ; taking steps to prevent the formation of nitrosamines and employing safe and effective measures to detoxify food and water before human consumption . "

The study was funded through grants from the National Institutes of Health .
Two subsequent papers have been accepted for publication in the near future that demonstrate experimentally that low levels of nitrosamine exposure cause neurodegeneration , NASH and diabetes .

Individuals and businesses filed 1.3 million bankruptcy cases in the year ended June 30 , an increase of 35 percent over the previous year , the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts said today .
It is the third consecutive annual increase , as the recession has forced thousands of businesses to close shop and as job losses and rising debt have caused individuals to seek protection from creditors .
Business filings increased 63 percent , while individual filings were up 34 percent .
“ This is reflective of the overall state of the economy , ” said Carey Ebert , president of the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys .
Ebert , name partner at Ebert Law Offices in Hurst , Texas , said she ’s seen the increase accelerate locally just in the last few months , as unemployment and home foreclosures hit areas of the country that previously fared better .
“ I do n’t see it getting better any time soon , ” she said .
The increase cuts across all types of bankruptcy , according to numbers from the Administrative Office .
Chapter 7 filings , the most common type for individuals , were up 47 percent , while Chapter 11 filings , the most common type for businesses , were up 91 percent .
And the most recent numbers give little sign that filings will slow down .
There were 381,000 filings in the three months ended June 30 , compared to 330,000 for the prior three months and 301,000 for the last three months of calendar 2008 .
The 381,000 filings are the most in a three - month period since late 2005 , a period when new rules took effect making it more difficult to declare bankruptcy .
The increase is likely to become ammunition for those who have been lobbying for changes to the bankruptcy system , including a proposal to give judges the ability to modify mortgage terms or even reduce the size of the mortgage principal .
Negotiations over that proposal have broken down in Congress amid objections from the financial services industry .
Congress is also considering a request from the Judicial Conference of the United States to authorize 13 new permanent bankruptcy judgeships , make 22 temporary judgeships permanent , and extend two temporary judgeships for five years .
Filings per judgeship have increased 60 percent in the last few years , according to congressional testimony last month .
“ In addition to near record case filings , bankruptcy courts now face bankruptcy cases that are more complex and time - consuming than anything previously handled , ” U.S. District Judge Barbara Lynn told a House Judiciary subcommittee last month .
Lynn chairs the Judicial Conference ’s Committee on the Administration of the Bankruptcy System .
“ Cases such as Chrysler , Circuit City , and other national and international corporate reorganizations consume a tremendous amount of a bankruptcy court ’s time , ” Lynn said .
“ Substantial increases in consumer case filings are also problematic for the courts that have inadequate judicial resources . ”
Subversion is a powerful tool .
Not only does it allow multiple developers to collaborate on a project , but it allows you to easily deploy your projects to the production server .
If you are using a checked out repository on your production server , rather than an exported copy , it is crucial that you protect your hidden .svn directories .
If you do not take measures to protect these hidden folders then your website will become extremely susceptible to attack .
Your .svn folders contain the pristine copies of every file with a . base extension .
This means that someone with a little know - how can navigate through your .svn folders and download your config files and obtain sensitive information such as your database password .
On top of that , they can simply steal all of your code and reproduce your site elsewhere with their name on the bottom .
So how do you protect your site against these attacks ?
If you have access to the domain ’s configuration files you can deny access there by adding the following lines :
< Directory ~ â€œ ^\.svnâ€>
Deny from all </ Directory >
If you are on a shared hosting plan and do not have access to these configuration files , then you can make use of mod_rewrite to block access to the subversion directories .
Open up your .htaccess file in your favourite text editor and include the following :
RewriteEngine on # Hide .SVN Folders RewriteRule ^(.*/)*\.svn/ / [ F,L ]
With these in place your website is now much a safer place .
North American pollution is a killer abroad ( Image : Lehtikuva OY / Rex Features )
More than 20,000 lives a year could be saved if major industrial regions cut their emissions of ozone - triggering gases by a fifth , a new study has found .
And the whole world would benefit : many victims of ozone pollution live a long way from the machines that cause it .
Although ozone high in the atmosphere is vital for our survival , shielding us from harmful UV radiation , at ground level it is very harmful and has been linked to respiratory conditions , heart attacks and even cancer .
Ozone forms when sunlight interacts with gases such as methane , nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide , emitted by ships , cars and power plants .
Advertisement
To investigate its effect on human health , Susan Anenberg of the University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill , and her colleagues used computer simulations to estimate how much ozone people in North America , the European Union , and south and east Asia would breathe if each region cut emissions of ozone triggers by a fifth .
The researchers then plugged this data into a public health model to estimate how many lives would be saved in each region thanks to such a drop in ozone levels .
Lethal traveller
They found that some 21,800 ozone - linked deaths a year could be avoided in the northern hemisphere alone .
But the biggest surprise was how many deaths blamed on ozone pollution in one region could be traced to emissions in another .
Up to 76 per cent of the people whose lives could be saved by North American emissions cuts live outside the continent , the researchers found .
“ Compared with the other regions , reducing emissions in North America could save the most lives abroad , ” Anenberg says .
The study found that cutting emissions in North America saved more lives in the EU than it did at home .
“ Ozone is mainly being generated on the polluted east coast of the US and carried over to Europe by the prevailing winds ” , says co-author Drew Shindell , of NASA ’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York .
Policy push
Anenberg hopes that the findings will spur US policy - makers to make more stringent cuts to the country ’s ozone emissions .
“ While the US commonly evaluates the domestic health benefits of proposed actions to reduce ozone pollution , this research shows that substantial benefits may result outside of national or continental boundaries , ” she says .
The EU is the region where the most people die because of foreign ozone pollution , particularly North American emissions , the study found .
Indeed , if all four regions cut emissions by a fifth , over 50 per cent of the deaths avoided in the EU would be thanks to foreign cuts , the research suggests .
“ Our results show that slightly more lives in Europe could be saved by reducing foreign emissions of ozone ‘ precursors ’ than by reducing European emissions , ” says Anenberg .
Asia alarm
Some regions are mostly poisoning themselves , though .
South Asia ’s ozone pollution , for example , kills the most people , and 90 per cent of its victims live locally .
Anenberg says that reducing ozone precursor emissions by 20 per cent in the region would save about 7600 lives a year there .
“ Our results suggest that collective international agreements may be desirable to reduce emissions and improve human health throughout the northern hemisphere , ” she says .
It would also buy time against the looming threat of global warming , says Shindell .
“ Given that many of the precursors of ozone – and ozone itself – are greenhouse gases , this finding adds even more to the rationale of tackling climate change . ”
“ All these results seem reasonable to me ” , says Mark Schoeberl , an atmospheric scientist with NASA ’s Earth Observing System based at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Maryland , who was not involved in the study .
“ They emphasise again that there is only one atmosphere and air pollution is a global problem , not just a local one . ”
That opinion is echoed by environmental scientist Mark Potosnak of DePaul University , Chicago : “ It ’s a typical result when further exploring human impacts on the environment – the world is a bit smaller than we first thought . ”

Changes
Deletes the Homebrew Channel v1.0.4 ( title ID HAXX ) and below and DVDX v1 ( title ID DVDX ) .
Now uses IOS70 .
Wii Shop Channel updated .
Most of the IOS 's have been updated or stubbed .
Updates your boot2 to boot2 v4 , overwriting BootMii / boot2 .
Checks for region converted Korean Wii ( checks for korean common key inside EEPROM ? ) if so then brick with a 003 Error .
Improved region checking for discs and titles , the system menu now checks the Title ID from the TMD .
What to do
System Menu 4.2 adds no new functionality .
Only official games require it to be installed , although this can be blocked via Priiloader or StartPatch .
The Wii Shop Channel was also updated , so the older version does n't work anymore .
If you have already updated , use Smash Stack , Indiana Pwns or Bannerbomb v2 to run the HackMii installer .
Affected homebrew
Issues
According to bushing , " The [ boot 2 update ] code [ from Ninty ] is so buggy that we decided to write our own for the HackMii installer . "
There are some people who are bricking their Wii as a result of doing a standard update , whether or not they had hacks before they updated .
It is therefore highly recommended that you do not upgrade until the ability to install BootMii plus boot 2 v4 in one go comes to the HackMii Installer .
Also if you have a region - converted Korean Wii ( for example Korean to US ) , this update will brick your Wii and return " Error 003 " on the screen .

The UK's Royal College of Psychiatrists ( " Let Wisdom Guide " ) wants something done about websites that encourage anorexia and bulimia .
" Pro-ana " and " pro-mia " sites appear to attract " a significant number of teenage girls ... in particular those with a high risk of eating disorders , " say the psychiatrists , and they encourage people to see anorexia and bulimia as " lifestyle choices " rather than mental health problems .
But banning such sites outright is n't appropriate .
Internet information exists on all sorts of terrible topics , but the RCP singles out pro-ana and pro-mia sites as for special comment because eating disorders " have a peak age of onset in adolescence , at a time in life when peer influences are particularly strong . "
Such disorders also show a " social contagion effect , " showing up in clusters rather than a random distribution .
Pro-eating disorder sites are therefore more than a reflection of a problem ; they can encourage more of it ( in the same way that sensational suicide reports in the media can lead to an increase in suicide ) .
We checked in with Kerry DeVries , a Chicago - area psychotherapist who works with adolescents who have eating disorders ; she confirms that eating disorders can be increased by putting girls who suffer from them into group settings with fellow sufferers .
" Girls that struggle with anorexia are extremely competitive with each other , " she says , " so groups in general have been contraindicated for their treatment .
It spikes the behavior when they get around each other , they start trying to outdo each other in degrees of skinniness . "
Pro-ana websites present exactly this sort of scenario .
" Having the websites offline would diminish access to a worldview that is deemed by scientists and psychologists to be incredibly unhealthy , one that can compromise [ girls ' ] health in a very strong way and shorten their lifespans significantly , " says DeVries .
But controlling such sites runs into freedom of speech issues in most democracies ; and as the RCP notes , " making them illegal would lead to criminalizing a vulnerable group of young people , " since most sites are set up by people who have an eating disorder themselves .
Instead , the RCP recommends that pro-ana and pro-mia sites become a part of the government 's action plan for Child Internet Safety , which encourages industry self - regulation and education for parents and teachers .
This is a less dramatic recommendation than one proposed last year in France to ban all such sites outright ( this failed to become law ) .
The Netherlands , under one proposal , would address the problem by leaving the site content alone but requiring a " click - through " notice to appear on first load , warning about its content .
Such schemes are always difficult to enforce on the Internet , though , as sites can easily be hosted in other countries where the laws are different .
For now , though , the sites serve as a reminder that the Internet " globalizes " all sorts of material — bringing even pro-ana and pro-mia communities into the smallest towns and schools where they might not otherwise exist .
And it 's not just the Internet , of course ; in the UK , a part of the Liberal Democrats ' new " Real Women " ( PDF ) campaign involves a push to " help women make informed choices by requiring adverts to clearly indicate the extent to which digital retouching technology has been used to create overly perfected and unrealistic images of women . "

Russell Wheeler , visiting fellow in Governance Studies at The Brookings Institution , predicts trouble for Obama 's judicial nominees .
This Jeffrey Toobin piece in the latest New Yorker illustrates what I predict will be the fatal flaw of the Obama administration : this strange , intellectualized fixation with a non-partisan strategy that is in no way supported by the results on the ground - nor is it an appropriate response to the electorate , which overwhelmingly rejected Republican policies .
The president does n't yet seem to understand that the continued opposition to his choices does n't have anything to do with his choices .
It 's Republican obstructionism , plain and simple .
( Although Orrin Hatch contends : " He started it ! " Uh huh .
Go take a nap , Orrin , you nasty old coot . )
The Obama Administration wanted to send a message with the President ’s first nomination to a federal court .
“ There was a real conscious decision to use that first appointment to say , ‘ This is a new way of doing things .
This is a post - partisan choice , ’ ” one White House official involved in the process told me .
“ Our strategy was to show that our judges could get Republican support . ”
So on March 17th President Obama nominated David Hamilton , the chief federal district - court judge in Indianapolis , to the Seventh Circuit court of appeals .
Hamilton had been vetted with care .
After fifteen years of service on the trial bench , he had won the highest rating from the American Bar Association ; Richard Lugar , the senior senator from Indiana and a leading Republican , was supportive ; and Hamilton ’s status as a nephew of Lee Hamilton , a well - respected former local congressman , gave him deep connections .
The hope was that Hamilton ’s appointment would begin a profound and rapid change in the confirmation process and in the federal judiciary itself . [...]
“ The unifying quality that we are looking for is excellence , but also diversity , and diversity in the broadest sense of the word , ” another Administration official said .
“ We are looking for experiential diversity , not just race and gender .
We want people who are not the usual suspects , not just judges and prosecutors but public defenders and lawyers in private practice . ”
Yet Hamilton and Sotomayor are the usual suspects — both sitting judges , who had already been confirmed by the Senate .
Of Obama ’s seven nominees to the circuit courts , six are federal district - court judges .
The group includes Gerard Lynch , a former Columbia Law School professor and New York federal prosecutor , and Andre Davis , who was nominated to the Fourth Circuit by Bill Clinton .
( At the time , Republicans blocked any vote on Davis . )
Two of the seven are African - American ; two are women ; all but one are in their fifties .
( None are openly gay . )
The one non-judge is Jane Stranch , who has represented labor unions and other clients at a Nashville law firm and is nominated for the Sixth Circuit .
They are conventional , qualified , and undramatic choices , who were named , at least in part , because they were seen as likely to be quickly confirmed .
But then , as the first White House official put it , “ Hamilton blew up . ”
Conservatives seized on a 2005 case , in which Hamilton ruled to strike down the daily invocation at the Indiana legislature because its repeated references to Jesus Christ violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment .
Hamilton had also ruled to invalidate a part of Indiana ’s abortion law that required women to make two visits to a doctor before undergoing the procedure .
In June , Hamilton was approved by the Judiciary Committee on a straight party - line vote , twelve to seven , but his nomination has not yet been brought to the Senate floor .
Some Republicans have already vowed a filibuster .
( Republican threats of extended debate on nominees can stop the Democratic majority from bringing any of them up for votes . )
“ The reaction to Hamilton certainly has given people pause here , ” the second White House official said .
“ If they are going to stop David Hamilton , then who wo n’t they stop ? ”
See what I mean ?
Why are they surprised ?
Why do they constantly split the difference on everything , watering down any meaningful differences ?
If I were making these decisions , I 'd be pushing the most liberal judges I could find , and make the Republicans explain over and over why they do n't want judges who rule in favor of working people .
Why would you throw away that opportunity ?
When I wrote about Text In The World over on my personal blog a few weeks ago , our colleague Matt Jones left a comment :
“ preparing us for AR ” ( augmented reality )
And this got me thinking about the ways that design and media can educate us about what future technologies might be like , or prepare us for large paradigm shifts .
What sort of products really are “ preparing ” us for Augmented Reality ?
A lot of consumer - facing the output of Augmented Reality at the moment tends to focus on combining webcams with specifically marked objects ; Julian Oliver ’s levelHead is one of the best - known examples :
But when AR really hits , it ’s going to be because the technology it ’s presented through has become much more advanced ; it wo n’t just be webcams and monitors , but embedded in smart displays , or glasses , or even the smart contact lenses of Warren Ellis ’ Clatter .
So whilst it ’s interesting to play with the version of the technology we have today , there ’s a lot of value to be gained from imagining what the design of fully - working AR systems might look like , unfettered by current day technological constraints .
And we can do that really well in things like videos , toys , and games .
Here ’s a lovely video from friend and colleague of Schulze & Webb , Timo Arnall :
Timo ’s video imagines using an AR map in an urban environment .
I particularly like how he emphasises that there are few limitations on scale when it comes to projecting AR – and the most convenient size for certain applications might be “ as big as you can make it ” .
Hence projecting the map across the entire pavement .
Here ’s another nice example : the Nearest Tube application for the iPhone 3GS :
This is perhaps a more exciting interpretation of what AR could be , and what AR devices might be ( not to mention a working , real - world example ) : the iPhone becomes a magic viewfinder on the world , a Subtle Knife that can cut through dimensions to show us the information layer sitting on top of the world .
It helps that it ’s both useful and pretty , too .
Games are a great way of getting ready for the interfaces technologies like AR afford .
Here ’s a clip I put together from EA Redwood Shores ’ Dead Space , illustrating the game UI :
Dead Space has no game HUD ; rather , the HUD is projected into the environment of the game as a manifestation of the UI of the hero ’s protective suit .
It means the environment can be designed as a realistic , functional spaceship , and then all the elements necessary for a game – readouts , inventories , not to mention guidelines as to what doors are locked or unlocked – can be manifested as overlay .
It ’s a striking way to place all the game ’s UI into the world , but it ’s also a great interpretation of what futuristic , AR user interfaces might be a bit like .
Finally , a toy that never fails to make me smile – the Tuttuki Bako :
This is Matt Jones playing with a Tuttuki Bako in our studio .
You place your finger into the hole in the box , and then use it to control a digital version of your finger on screen in a variety of games .
It ’s somewhat uncanny to watch , but serves as a great example of a somewhat different approach to augmented realities – the idea that our bodies could act as digital prosthetics .
All these examples show different ways of exploring an impending , future technology .
Whilst much of the existing , tangible work in the AR space is incremental , building upon available technology , it ’s likely that the real advances in it will be from technology we can not yet conceive .
Given that , it makes sense to also consider concepting from a purely hypothetical design perspective – trying things out unfettered by technological limitations .
The technology will , after all , one day catch up .
What ’s exciting is that this concept and design work is not always to be found in the work of design studios or technologists ; it also appears in software , toys , and games that are readily consumable .
In their own way , they are perhaps doing a better job of educating the wider world about AR ( or other new technologies ) than innumerable tech demos with white boxes .
The announcement of the pending CIA torture investigations by AG Eric Holder , SHOULD WORRY DICK CHENEY .
Why ?
Because as Former President George W. Bush was leaving office , all his dirty shit was unraveling .
In fact , Bush could not wait for the " klieg lights " to be dim on him for good , his words .
As we thought in our gut that Karl Rove had a heavy hand in the firings of U.S. Attorneys , and we were RIGHT .
We will soon find out , who gave what orders , to do what , to these prisoners .
Just as we found out about the lies of the Bush Administration to take this country to Iraq for a War that was of choice , not necessity , it is important that we know everything and clean it up .
Why ?
Because this country , the United States of America is bigger and better than what we , its citizens saw and let transpire .
By the time George W. Bush was to leave office , there was barely a country he could go to .
The disdain of the Bush Administration and its policy of the Iraq
War were so negative , he would have been booed to high heaven .
As he was the last time in Europe and as we witnessed an Iraqi journalist throwing shoes at President Bush , which is to signify total disdain and disrespect .
George W. Bush may have ended up signing off on a lot of things he did not totally know about or just cared not to , but in the end , he will be on the hot seat , too .
But , Dick Cheney has already been implicated on knowing and dealing the thing called " torture " .
Now , out of office and writing a book , anytime you bring up the word " investigation " he puts his ass on television in a flash to denounce the Obama Administration and call it " partisan or political " , when in fact Barack Obama does not want to go down this road , this call is purely from the Justice Department .
See , when you follow the LAW and do n't politicize every department , let each department act independently of the White House , as Justice is supposed to , you end up with an investigation .
So , today Dick Cheney released his bogus daughter , Lynn Cheney to This Week with George Stephanopoulos , but there was a seasoned journalist on the panel by the name of Sam Donaldson and he was having none of her bullshit nonsense of tap dancing around questions and straight up not answering them .
View the whole exchange , here .
And the shorter version is below :
And of course , in the end Dick Cheney is PROUD that he had the guts to torture .

KABUL , Sept 9 ( Reuters ) - Can President Barack Obama ask Americans to send more of their sons and daughters to die in Afghanistan to defend a government willing to steal an election ?
That is the stark political question that U.S. officials may have to grapple with in the next few weeks if President Hamid Karzai continues to ignore evidence of fraud in last month 's Afghan presidential poll .
An election complaints watchdog mainly appointed by the United Nations has said it had found " clear and convincing evidence of fraud " in the vote and ordered a partial recount .
That did not stop Karzai from praising in a statement on Wednesday the " honest " and " impartial " vote .
The disputed preliminary results show him heading for a first round victory .
Diplomats say the election is not over until the recount .
Fraud investigators may yet succeed in cleaning up the tally and coming up with a result that Afghans can accept as legitimate , with or without requiring Karzai to face a second round run-off .
" We have to see the result of their investigations , " British ambassador Mark Sedwill said .
" We always knew there would be fraud in this election , a lot of irregularities , I 'm afraid that was inevitable , and we talked about that before the election . "
Sorting it out may yet take months .
Whatever the outcome , the apparent fraud already on display has further hurt the image of a government seen by many in the West as feeble and corrupt .
Tallies -- some since removed from the election commission 's website without explanation -- featured such anomalies as entire villages where Karzai received every single vote cast , including exactly 500 votes each at four neighbouring polling stations .
Karzai's apparent eagerness to ignore concerns , hurry through the process and claim the prize has chilled an already frosty relationship with the new U.S. administration .
It could do far more damage in coming weeks when Obama has to decide whether to double down on a risky strategy and send more troops .
WORST TIME
The election standoff could hardly come at a worse time for Obama , who has made Afghanistan the primary foreign policy focus of his presidency .
He has already sent 21,000 extra troops to Afghanistan , ramping up an escalation begun at the end of last year by his predecessor George W. Bush .
Since then , the war has become far deadlier , support for it at home has eroded , U.S. opinion - shapers have come out against it and NATO allies have wobbled in public .
Sitting on the president 's desk is a week - old classified assessment of the eight - year - old war from Obama 's hand - picked new commander , General Stanley McChrystal , which is widely believed to make a case for sending more troops .
Obama was supposed to take that decision after the outcome of Afghanistan 's election was clear .
Now , an announcement of more troops may coincide with newspaper headlines about a protracted dispute over vote fraud by Washington 's ally .
" It will be very difficult to justify the support of the outcome of an election , for which hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent and NATO soldiers have died , ... ( if ) fraud decides the outcome , not the will of the people , " Karzai 's main opponent , Abdullah Abdullah , told Reuters .
The relationship between the Obama administration and Karzai -- which both sides have acknowledged got off to an awkward start earlier this year -- now appears headed off the rails .
The day after the election , when Karzai 's campaign manager prematurely declared a first - round victory by a wide margin , Obama 's envoy Richard Holbrooke had a tense meeting with Karzai to urge him not to pre-empt the result .
SEETHING
Karzai has taken to seething to reporters about his perceived mistreatment at the hands of Obama officials .
Speaking about himself in the third person to a French journalist last week , he said : " The Americans attack Karzai in an underhand fashion because they want him to be more tractable .
They are wrong .
It is in their interest ... that Afghanistan 's people respect their president . "
U.S. policy makers have long understood that this autumn would be crunch time for Afghanistan policy .
With thousands of new troops pushing into Taliban - held areas , the summer just past was always going to be the deadliest period of the war .
It lived up to that billing : July was the deadliest month of the war for U.S. troops until August surpassed it .
Polls show the U.S. public losing patience .
Democratic members of Congress are grumbling .
In the past week , influential newspaper columnists George Will and Nicholas Kristof -- representing the right and left of the U.S. political spectrum -- came out in favour of an early exit .
Another , Thomas Friedman , expressed deep reservations .
If public support for the war has waned in America , it has cratered in Europe , where Washington still relies on allies for political support and 40,000 troops .
Britain and Germany called on Sunday for a conference later this year that would set new targets for Afghanistan to take over its own security and let Western troops withdraw .
" As the Afghans take on more responsibility for their security , then the international engagement can be reduced , " German Chancellor Angela Merkel said at a news conference flanked by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown .
In a joint letter with French President Nicolas Sarkozy to the head of the United Nations , they called for " new benchmarks and timelines " for handing over responsibilities to Afghans .
Brown offered on Wednesday to host the conference .
While his allies appear to be looking for an exit , Obama is contemplating sending more troops .
Karzai has not made that decision any easier .

After a long and nervous wait for those of us stuck on Earth , the world 's most famous observatory is back on the job !
Behold !
W00t !
That 's NGC 6217 , a spiral galaxy as seen by Hubble 's Advanced Camera for Surveys , a workhorse detector on Hubble that went on the fritz in January 2007 .
But when the STS - 125 brought the Space Shuttle Atlantis to Hubble , it also carried two new cameras and the tools to fix two older , busted ones , including ACS .
After a daring series of repairs and upgrades , Hubble is now back up to speed .
This ACS image is gorgeous .
NGC 6217 is relatively close by , at a distance of roughly 80 million light years ( note that some early press said it was 6 million light years away , which is incorrect ) .
The gas and stars in the middle form an exquisite rectangular bar across the core due to complicated gravitational interactions , and you can easily pick out huge numbers of glowing pink star forming areas , where stars are being born in prodigious quantities .
And even from this vast distance -- 800 quintillion kilometers ( 500 quintillion miles ) --
Hubble can still pick out individual stars in the spiral arms .
These are the biggest , baddest , and brightest ones , the stars that will someday explode as monstrous supernovae ... and you can rest assured astronomers will be using Hubble or its successors to observe them when they do .
But there 's more !
Check out this deep image of the cluster Omega Centauri :
Click to embiggen .
Credit : NASA , ESA , and the Hubble SM4 ERO Team
Wow !
This picture is from the newly installed Wide Field Camera 3 , the third generation such camera on Hubble .
The image shows a portion of the globular cluster Omega Centauri , a giant ball of millions of stars that orbits the Milky Way .
This image alone shows about 100,000 stars at all stages of evolution , from slowly glowing yellow to furiously churning red -- stars at the ends of their lives , about to fizzle out into tiny , hot white dwarfs -- and finally sapphire blue stars , helium - rich objects also nearing cosmic senescence .
But of all the gorgeous images released today , there is one that is very , very special to me :
It may not look like much to you , but to me that picture sings .
As far as the science goes , it 's a spectrum ( the light from an object sliced up into thousands of individual colors ) of the titanic star Eta Carinae , a monster 100 times the mass of the Sun -- the upper limit for how big a star can be without tearing itself apart -- that will some day soon explode as a supernova , and may even be a gamma-ray burst .
This image shows the light from the star dissected , displaying the velocity and chemical composition of the massive gas clouds surrounding the star : huge lobes of material ejected in a violent outburst from the star over a hundred years ago .
Spectra like this let us keep tabs on Eta Car , monitoring it for changes that will gives us clues on how this bizarre and frankly scary star is behaving .
But to me , as important as the science and knowledge gained from this data are , it 's the mere fact of its existence that is so important .
The image is from the Space Telescope Imaging Spectroscope , a camera I worked on for more than six years .
I helped calibrate and test STIS as it was built , and I watched as it roared into space aboard Discovery in 1997 .
For three more years I worked on the incredible data from STIS , displayed on my computer screen , as this camera tool the pulse of the Universe with spectra and images of objects as close as asteroids in our solar system to galaxies 10 billion light years away .
I worked on data that laid out to me the chemical composition , temperature , and distance of stars , galaxies , gas clouds , gamma-ray bursts , and so much more .
I sweated blood on STIS , and so when it suffered a debilitating short in 2004 I was pretty upset .
It was like losing a member of the family .
STIS sat silent for five years , orbiting the Earth in Hubble 's instrument bay .
But in May 2009 , astronauts were able to repair the shorted computer board on STIS during a very dramatic space walk .
After that I heard nothing for months , which was making me nuts .
But no longer .
I 'm not at all ashamed to say that when I saw this STIS graphic of Eta Car , I choked up , and there were -- oh hell , there still are as I write this -- tears in my eyes .
I 'm so proud of the team that built STIS , the hundreds of people who used it , the incredible people at NASA , and the men and women of our astronaut corps who risked their lives to make sure our eye on the sky is clear , clean , updated , and razor - focused .
With its quiver full of new and newly repaired cameras , as well as shiny new gyroscopes and other critical pieces of equipment , we 'll be seeing more and better - than - ever scientific images and spectra from Hubble for many , many more years to come .

John V –
Domtila Aguti , from Olwelai village in Katine , recently suffered a miscarriage .
It would have been her 14th child , a remarkable feat even by Ugandan national standards , where on average a woman gives birth to seven children in her lifetime .
When Aguti , 39 , had her last child nearly two years ago , doctors warned that having more children could endanger her life .
She had earlier used an injectable form of contraception and was considering resuming this method when she realised she was pregnant again .
She and her husband , Stanislas Olupot , do n't want to take any more chances , which is why they are among the 60 women and men seated on benches under a mango tree at Tiriri health centre one Monday listening to officials from the reproductive health NGO Marie Stopes .
They want tubal ligation – female sterilisation – which means Aguti will not have any more children .

" We were told by village health team ( VHTs ) members that there was this permanent method of contraception and we agreed , with my husband , that we should get it , " says Aguti , a farmer who also makes some money by selling doughnuts on market days .
Family planning is a divisive issue in Uganda .
The Catholic church to which about 42 % of the population belong , preaches against artificial or modern contraception .
Like many African men who pride themselves in having many children , Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni wants the country 's population of 30 million to grow , even as experts warn that the annual population growth rate of 3.2 % could wipe out any gains from economic growth .
According to the Uganda Bureau of Statistics , only 18 % of married Ugandan women use modern contraceptives , while 6 % use other methods of family planning .
Another 41 % of women would like to use contraceptives but can't access services , or are unable to afford them .
According to the Amref project officer for health , Joseph Otim , properly planned families are seen as one way of reducing infant and maternal mortality .
The idea of family planning is being gradually introduced into Katine and this slow approach appears to be paying off .
Otim says Amref first engaged district health officials and staff at Tiriri health centre on family planning .
Then it trained VHTs about the advantages of family planning , the various methods available and how to promote the idea in the community and refer women to health centres .
VHTs are also helping distribute condoms in their villages .
Meanwhile , traditional birth attendants , with whom Amref meets monthly , are being encouraged to refer expectant mothers to health centres for more information on family planning services .
Amref and Tiriri health centre have now linked up with Marie Stopes to provide a range of services to villagers , including implants and tubal ligation , which were otherwise not available in Katine .
On their first visit to Katine in May , Marie Stopes officials performed 16 tubal ligation procedures alone .
Last month when officials returned to the sub -county the turnout was even higher .
But so was the level of disappointment because the Marie Stopes doctor responsible for carrying out procedures fell ill and did not travel with the team .
Two support officers , however , were available to answer questions .
Villages were advised to return on September 16 .
" I am disappointed because I wanted to get this done today , but I am satisfied with the explanation , " Aguti said .
Explaining the side effects
Aguti and her husband know the advantages of family planning .
After the birth of their ninth child Aguti started using an injectable contraceptive , Injectaplan , until the couple decided to have more children .
She says spacing children gives a mother time to rest while raising the younger ones .
" It is also difficult to educate and feed very many children .
For instance with the current food shortages , we are struggling to buy enough food for the family , " she says .
Despite this knowledge , many families have far more children than they can adequately provide for .
The problem , Aguti says , has been lack of information at the community level .
Waiting to advise expectant mothers who visit health centres has not got the message across .
By training VHTs to spread the word in their villages , Amref seems to have overcome that problem in Katine .
But another hurdle to overcome is the side effects and myths associated with family planning .
Olupot says that health workers need to explain to people from the start that contraceptives can cause bleeding and headaches and other problems .
When Aguti first used Injectaplan , she developed heavy bleeding , but the couple persevered .
" I just went back to Soroti hospital and they gave us some treatment and the problems eventually disappeared , " says Olupot .
" But when our first child after stopping Injectaplan died of malaria at eight months of age , a rumour went around that he died because of it .
Indeed we had three other children after that and they are all healthy . "

And the article 's original title was so outrageous that within hours the USA Today editors felt compelled to tone it down .
But I 'm getting ahead of myself .
It 's no secret that men been hit hard in the current recession .
The USA Today article acknowledges that men have lost 74 % of jobs since December 2007 , with women losing the remaining 26 % .
The reason is men predominate in construction and manufacturing , sectors that have suffered a massive hemorrhaging of jobs .
Most would view these numbers with dismay and even alarm .
In many families men are the primary breadwinners and men's job loss hurts their wives , children , and dependent parents .
And unemployment is emotionally devastating to many men .
But socialists view massive male unemployment with undisguised glee .
After all , if we can't force more women out of the home into the workplace , then we can achieve numerical workforce equality by throwing millions of men off the assembly line .
USA Today quotes economist Heidi Hartmann of the Institute for Women 's Policy Research : " It was a long historical slog to get to this point . "
Apparently Hartmann 's only regret is the recession did n't hit a few years sooner .
And wait , there 's more good news !
Not only have men lost 4.75 million jobs , but now that the economic stimulus plan is kicking in , men are having trouble getting back on their feet .
Why ?
Because federal stimulus money is being directed to education , healthcare , and social services , sectors that tend to be female - dominated .
( This did n't happen by accident --
For those who have a remaining scintilla of concern over the plight of men , University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan assures us , " Unemployment among men is n't going to last forever .
People will move from construction and manufacturing to industries that are creating new jobs . "
That 's right , guys , if you got laid off as a $ 35 an hour crane operator or tool - and - die worker , not to worry .
With a little training you can become a home health aide , social worker , or teacher 's assistant !
It 's not just the article itself that created such a fuss .

USA Today published a lead article Thursday that is one of those now - I - understand - what - socialism - is - all - about articles .
The essay 's pretzel logic is so outlandish that I promise to keep a straight face as I explain it to you .
And the article 's original title was so outrageous that within hours the USA Today editors felt compelled to tone it down .
But I 'm getting ahead of myself .
It 's no secret that men been hit hard in the current recession .
The USA Today article acknowledges that men have lost 74 % of jobs since December 2007 , with women losing the remaining 26 % .
The reason is men predominate in construction and manufacturing , sectors that have suffered a massive hemorrhaging of jobs .
Most would view these numbers with dismay and even alarm .
In many families men are the primary breadwinners and men's job loss hurts their wives , children , and dependent parents .
And unemployment is emotionally devastating to many men .
But socialists view massive male unemployment with undisguised glee .
After all , if we can't force more women out of the home into the workplace , then we can achieve numerical workforce equality by throwing millions of men off the assembly line .
USA Today quotes economist Heidi Hartmann of the Institute for Women 's Policy Research : " It was a long historical slog to get to this point . "
Apparently Hartmann 's only regret is the recession did n't hit a few years sooner .
And wait , there 's more good news !
Not only have men lost 4.75 million jobs , but now that the economic stimulus plan is kicking in , men are having trouble getting back on their feet .
Why ?
Because federal stimulus money is being directed to education , healthcare , and social services , sectors that tend to be female - dominated .
( This did n't happen by accident -- here 's why . )
Local jurisdictions have cut 86,000 men from payrolls during the recession , while hiring 167,000 women , a transformation USA Today applauds as " remarkable .
" For those who have a remaining scintilla of concern over the plight of men , University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan assures us , " Unemployment among men is n't going to last forever .
People will move from construction and manufacturing to industries that are creating new jobs .
" That 's right , guys , if you got laid off as a $ 35 an hour crane operator or tool - and - die worker , not to worry .
With a little training you can become a home health aide , social worker , or teacher 's assistant !
It 's not just the article itself that created such a fuss .
Its original title , " Women Take Over Job Market , " was seen as overtly gender - baiting .
So within hours it was changed to read , " Women Gain as Men Lose Jobs . "
But on one point , the reporter commendably veered away from the predictable liberal lies .
For years Democrats have claimed that women have been subjected to wage discrimination , noting that women earn 77 % of what men make .
But this time USA Today admitted the true cause of the gender gap : " On average , women work fewer hours than men [ and ] hold more part - time jobs .
" And if there is any doubt about the radical social agenda that lurks behind the USA Today article , flip ahead to the article 's concluding sentence : " The image that the man has to be the breadwinner has changed .

This weekend is Rosh Hashanah , which I understand from that Jon Stewart stand - up special is the Jewish new year .
So while you 're polishing the shofar and boning up on your Amidah , you could also get in the spirit by checking out a few of the more ... inspirational Jewish characters from the movies .
5. Zohan Dvir ( Adam Sandler ) -- You Do n't Mess With The Zohan ( 2008 )
Having been raised Catholic in two of the least Jewish areas of the country ( Salt Lake City , UT and College Station , TX ) , I have to thank Sandler for teaching me so much about Israeli Jews .
Specifically , that they all love disco and have enormous amounts of pubic hair .
Oh , and thanks also for giving Rob Schneider another movie .
Awesome .
4. The Basterds ( Brad Pitt , Eli Roth , et. al. ) -- Inglourious Basterds ( 2009 )
Time will tell if Tarantino 's bold strategy of casting Eli Roth in a major role will have the additional desired effect of keeping him from directing any more Hostel movies .
3 . The Bielski Brothers ( Daniel Craig , Live Schreiber , Jamie Bell ) -- Defiance ( 2008 )
I liked how the reviews of this movie all contained some variant of " Jews can kick ass , too . "
I guess they never heard of a certain character named Alvy fucking Singer .
2. Mordechai Jefferson Carver ( Adam Goldberg ) -- The Hebrew Hammer ( 2003 )
The combination of blaxpolitation and Jewish Orthodoxy makes so much sense you wonder why nobody thought of it before , until you remember that whole historical animosity thing .
1. Moses ( Charlton Heston ) -- The Ten Commandments ( 1956 )
The Big Kahuna of Judaic cinema badassery , Moses ' achievements also far outstrip those of anyone else on the list .
It 's Heston who really sells it , however .
We 'd have a hard time buying " Behold His mighty hand " coming from , say , Sid Caesar .
BONUS : Jesus Christ ( Phil Caracas ) -- Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter ( 2001 )
The problem with most of your cinematic representations of Jesus is , he 's kind of a pansy .
Now , I understand this is part of the whole " turn the other cheek " shtick , but here we have a Savior modern , ass - kicking Americans can really get behind .
The Net neutality debate got another boost Monday when FCC chairman Julius Genachowski proposed the addition of two Internet policy principles that would require reasonable and transparent network management .
The Net neutality debate got another boost Monday when FCC chairman Julius Genachowski proposed the addition of two Internet policy principles that would require reasonable and transparent network management .
" The Internet is an extraordinary platform for innovation , job creation , investment , and opportunity .
It has unleashed the potential of entrepreneurs and enabled the launch and growth of small businesses across America , " Genachowski said during at event at the Brookings Institute .
" It is vital that we safeguard the free and open Internet . "
Genachowski proposed expanding the FCC's Internet policy principles , a set of four principles released by the agency in 2005 that serve as a framework for broadband Internet access .
The first addition would prevent ISPs from discriminating against particular Internet content or applications , while allowing for reasonable network management .
" This means they cannot block or degrade lawful traffic over their networks , or pick winners by favoring some content or applications over others in the connection to subscribers ' homes with a similar service offered by that broadband provider , " Genachowski said .
" The Internet must continue to allow users to decide what content and applications succeed . "
The second addition would ensure that ISPs are transparent about network management .
Genachowski also wants to clarify that these principles apply to all platforms that access the Internet .
The chairman will formally unveil these suggestions at the FCC's October meeting via a notice of proposed rulemaking .
Stakeholders will have an opportunity to share their thoughts on the proposal , including what they consider to be reasonable network management .
" We 've already seen some clear examples of deviations from the Internet 's historic openness , " Genachowski said .
The idea of network management first made headlines in 2007 , when Comcast was accused of blocking access to file - sharing Web sites .
Last year , the FCC handed down an enforcement action against Comcast , which required the cable provider to be more transparent about its policies .
Comcast argued that the FCC's Internet Policy Principles were unenforceable because they have not been adopted as official FCC rules , and they are appealing the commission 's ruling .
" Greater transparency will give consumers the confidence of knowing that they 're getting the service they 've paid for , enable innovators to make their offerings work effectively over the Internet , and allow policymakers to ensure that broadband providers are preserving the Internet as a level playing field , " Genachowsk said .
Detractors have argued that Net neutrality rules will stifle innovation and investment , a notion Genachowski shot down Monday .
" History 's lesson is clear : Ensuring a robust and open Internet is the best thing we can do to promote investment and innovation , " he said .
" And while there are some who see every policy decision as either pro-business or pro-consumer , I reject that approach ; it 's not the right way to see technology 's role in America . "
" We welcome the dialogue suggested by the chairman in his comments , and we completely agree that any consideration of new ' rules of the road ' begin with notice and an open , public rulemaking proceeding  this is both fair and appropriate , " Comcast executive vice president David L. Cohen wrote in a Monday blog post .
" But before we rush into a new regulatory environment for the Internet , let 's remember there can be no doubt that the Internet has enjoyed immense growth even as these debates have gone on . "
Editor 's Note :
This story was updated at 11:30 am Eastern time with additional comments from Genachowski and Comcast .
Once upon a time , I had to quickly resolve thousands of DNS names .
My first solution was to call gethostbyname repeatedly for each of the hosts .
This turned out to be extremely slow .
I could only do 200 hosts in a minute .
I talked with someone and he suggested to try to do it asynchronously .
I looked around and found adns - asynchronous dns library .
Since I was writing the code in Python , I looked around some more and found Python bindings for adns .
I tried adns and - wow - I could do 20000 hosts in a minute !
In this post I want to share the slow code and the fast asynchronous code .
The slow code is only useful if you need to resolve just several domains .
The asynchronous code is much more useful .
I made it as a Python module so that you can reuse it .
It 's called " async_dns.py " and an example of how to use it is included at the bottom of the post .
Here is the slow code that uses gethostbyname .
The only reusable part of this code is " resolve_slow " function that takes a list of hosts to resolve , resolves them , and returns a dictionary containing { host : ip } pairs .
To measure how fast it is I made it resolve hosts " www.domain0.com " , " www.domain1.com " , ... , " www.domain999.com " and print out how long the whole process took .
#!/usr /bin/python import socket from time import time def resolve_slow ( hosts ) : " " " Given a list of hosts , resolves them and returns a dictionary containing {' host ' : ' ip '} .
If resolution for a host failed , ' ip ' is None . " " " resolved_hosts = {} for host in hosts : try : host_info = socket.gethostbyname( host ) resolved_hosts [ host ] = host_info except socket.
gaierror , err : resolved_hosts [ host ] =
None return resolved_hosts if __name__ == " __main__ " : host_format = " www.domain%d.com " number_of_hosts = 1000 hosts = [ host_format % i for i in range ( number_of_hosts ) ] start = time ( ) resolved_hosts = resolve_slow ( hosts ) end = time ( ) print " It took %.2 f seconds to resolve %d hosts . " % ( end - start , number_of_hosts )
And here is the fast code that uses adns .
I created a class " AsyncResolver " that can be reused if you import it from this code .
Just like " resolve_slow " from the previous code example , it takes a list of hosts to resolve and returns a dictionary of { host : ip } pairs .
If you run this code , it will print out how long it took to resolve 20000 hosts .
#!/usr /bin/python # import adns from time import time class AsyncResolver ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , hosts , intensity =100 ) : " " " hosts : a list of hosts to resolve intensity : how many hosts to resolve at once " " " self .
hosts = hosts self .
intensity = intensity self.adns = adns.init( ) def resolve ( self ) : " " " Resolves hosts and returns a dictionary of { ' host ' : ' ip ' }. " " " resolved_hosts = {} active_queries = {} host_queue = self.hosts [ :] def collect_results ( ) : for query in self.adns.completed ( ) : answer = query.
check ( ) host = active_queries [ query ] del active_queries [ query ] if answer [ 0 ] == 0 : ip = answer [ 3 ] [ 0 ] resolved_hosts [ host ] = ip elif answer [ 0 ] == 101 : # CNAME query = self.adns.submit( answer [ 1 ] , adns.rr.A ) active_queries [ query ] = host else : resolved_hosts [ host ] = None def finished_resolving ( ) : return len( resolved_hosts ) == len(self.hosts ) while not finished_resolving ( ) : while host_queue and len( active_queries ) < self.intensity : host = host_queue.pop ( ) query = self.adns.submit( host , adns.rr.A ) active_queries [ query ] = host collect_results ( ) return resolved_hosts if __name__ == " __main__ " : host_format = " www.host%d.com " number_of_hosts = 20000 hosts = [ host_format % i for i in range ( number_of_hosts ) ] ar = AsyncResolver ( hosts , intensity =500 ) start = time ( ) resolved_hosts = ar.resolve ( ) end = time ( ) print " It took %.2 f seconds to resolve %d hosts . " % ( end - start , number_of_hosts )
I wrote it in a manner that makes it reusable in other programs .
Here is an example of how to reuse this code :
from async_dns import AsyncResolver ar = AsyncResolver ( [ " www.google.com " , " www.reddit.com " , " www.nonexistz.net " ] ) resolved = ar.resolve ( ) for host , ip in resolved .items ( ) : if ip is None : print " %s could not be resolved . " % host else : print " %s resolved to %s " % ( host , ip )
Output :
www.nonexistz.net could not be resolved .
www.reddit.com resolved to 159.148.86.207 www.google.com resolved to 74.125.39.99

U.S. Trade Representative and former Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk said he was befuddled and embarrassed to be from Texas after hearing of the controversy in North Texas surrounding President Barack Obama 's speech to students .
Many North
Texas school districts chose not to broadcast the president 's speech live after parents expressed outrage over either their belief that Obama planned to try to indoctrinate their children or they objected to a series of questions and lesson plans designed by the White House to spark discussion and learning following the speech .
" I 'm befuddled .
There are few moments in my life where I 'm embarrassed to say I 'm from Texas , this was one of them , " Kirk said .
" I think that some of those that have been the most ungracious and discourteous five years from now will be embarrassed by their behavior .
But right now , I guess the best we can do is be embarrassed for them . "
Ambassador Kirk uttered the remarks Tuesday after arriving at Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts in Dallas , where he planned to watch the speech with about 400 students and then participate in a , hopefully , lively question and answer session with students following the president 's 11 a.m. speech .
Two students at the school opted not to take part in watching the speech or the session with Kirk .
The uproar led the White House to release the transcript of the speech days before it was to be delivered .
The White House also backed off plans to ask teachers to assign lessons that included writing a paper on how they could help the president .
After reading the speech , many were left to wonder what the huff was all about .
Read a full transcript here .
" Former President Bush still visits schools .
It is absolutely one of the best things those of us in public service can do , " Kirk said .
" I think one of the best uses of our time is to talk to young people and encourage them . "
In Dallas , the district made the speech available but left it up to each principal to choose whether to show it or not .
Fort Worth was showing the speech , but made alternative options for those who did not wish to view it .
In Arlington , the speech would be made available on it 's Web site for students to watch on their own .
One local church opened its doors Tuesday , inviting anyone who wanted to watch it inside .
Students were allowed in only with an excused absence from class -- which Mansfield and Arlington allowed .
Think China vs. India
The U.S. ’ potential conflict with Iran might pale in comparison to a fight brewing between China and India , says Chris Mayer .
“ This one does n’t seem to get much attention in the Western media , but I ’ve read some dire stuff from the Eastern media .
By their lights , the Sino - Indian border has n’t been this tense since 1986 - 87 , when the skirmishes broke out between Indian and Chinese troops .
“ The issue is a disputed border between the two .
They fought a 32 - day war over it in 1962 .
China emerged victorious , but the whole thing settled nothing .
The border between the two remains hotly contested .
It is nearly 2,500 miles long and winds its way across difficult mountainous terrain .
There is a northeastern state in India called Arunachal Pradesh , which China calls “ Southern Tibet ” and claims as Chinese territory .
“ India claims last year there were nearly 300 border violations by Chinese troops and over 2,000 instances of ‘ aggressive border patrolling . ’
In the Indian media , it ’s become a kind of sport to guess when China will attack India .
And a recent essay by a Chinese analyst added fuel to the fire when it claimed China could ‘ dismember the so - called “ Indian Union ” with one little move . ’
“ What would the effects be ?
It ’s hard to say .
But if the world ’s two largest and fastest - growing emerging markets go to war , the results ca n’t be good for the global economy .
China is even India ’s largest trading partner .
It all depends on how it unfolds . ”
Chris will be getting a frontlines view of this flash point over the next few weeks .
He and our executive publisher Addison Wiggin will be scouting potential joint ventures in the UAE and India from this weekend until mid-October .

As quickly as it disappeared , the matte ( or rather , " anti-glare " ) screen option has returned to the 15 - inch MacBook Pro .
Apple quietly slid the option back in as a $ 50 add - on when ordering a new machine through the online store after almost a year of going glossy - only .
Apple announced its plans to ditch the matte display for the 15 - inch MacBook Pro line during the October 2008 Notebook media event in Cupertino .
The controversial decision incensed MacBook Pro owners from all walks of life , though Apple argued that the glossy display had deeper blacks and showed more vivid colors .
Even designers were somewhat split on whether this was a good decision -- we hosted a minor debate between our own two designers in the Ars MacBook Pro review .
Some users never quite accepted the change , however , insisting that Apple should bring the matte option back .
Well , as of this morning , those users can sleep easy once again .
As noted by AppleInsider , the decision to extend antiglare options has been rumored since July .
The 17 - inch MacBook Pro has always had both options , of course , and the ( now - Pro ) 13 - inch MacBook remains glossy - only .

Application
Liquid EPDM Rubber and Liquid Roof Application
For a complete list of suggested application click here .
If you have any of the following roof types , you will first need to apply a coat of the proflex primer which is available here .
Preparation .
Although light rain can directly touch Liquid EPDM before it has cured , we suggest that you plan a day when rain is not in the forecast .
Liquid Roof may be applied at any temperature , but we suggest between 55° - 80° for comfort .
Liquid Rubber needs 55° for the product to cure .
Many people have asked us if they can apply it below that temperature .
The answer is of course , YES , but the curing process wo n’t continue until it gets above 55° .
Assuming you have a smooth surface that needs to be coated , the coverage per gallon is approximately 42 square feet .
For rough substrates , the coverage is 30 feet per gallon .
An example of a rough substrate is plywood or troweled concrete .
After you have completed the application , we suggest waiting approximately 48 to 72 hours before walking on the surface .
It will develop a skin within 12 hours .
Note that it may take up to seven days for a full cure to result .
For any separation in the joints we suggest filling them with the Rutex caulk found on or order form .
This Caulk has been field tested and is compatible with the liquid epdm and will not void its warranty .
It is free of any solvents or isocyanates and is 100 % volume solids .
More information can be found HERE ( RUBEX CAULK )
Once your roof inspection is complete and any structural issues have been repaired , you also want to be sure that any silicone , tar or asphalt - based materials are removed as best as possible .
You will need to prime those areas first with the ProFlex Primer which can be found on our order form .
Remember that the primer is only needed for asphalt based products and elastomeric .
Any rips in the seams or spacing more than 1/15 of an inch , and we suggest reinforcing them with either poly - fabric or the butyl two - sided tape .
Both are available on our order form .
Any holes , gaps , seams or tears ( of more than 1/16 - inch wide ) should be repaired or reinforced .
Rusted areas on your metal roof need to be brushed with a wire brush to get as much of the oxidized off as possible
Any corrosion that is not loose is fine to apply the liquid epdm over .
In the event your roof is tar or asphalt based you will need to apply a coating of the ProFlex primer to allow for an acceptable substrate for the liquid epdm rubber to adhere to .
If someone has previously applied a roof cement or any silicone caulking it will need to be removed and replaced with a butly type caulk or acrylic .
Before applying the product , ensure that the surface is clean from any debris that might be picked up in the application with the roller .
We suggest a mild detergent washing with Simple Green or something similar .
This will minimize the oils , dirt and debris that was present .
If you have any mold or mildew that has built up on the surface , we suggest first washing those areas with a 1/3 bleach to water ratio .
Be sure that the surface of the roof is perfectly dry before applying the Liquid Roof .
Liquid EPDM will not adhere to moist or damp surfaces .
Particularly on those summer mornings , let the dew dry .
Keep some Xylene or basic mineral spirits on hand just in case you get the Liquid Rubber on unwanted areas .
The shelf life of the products are 6 months .
We are not responsible for product that is not stored in room temperature or past the shelf life .
For more on mixing instructions watch the video below .
This is a true one - coat application .
There is no need for a second coat .
However , if you want to apply it a little thicker , we suggest doing that on the first coat as opposed to a second coat .
Pour the material onto flat surfaces and then spread with a squeegee .
Reapply over the areas with a short nap roller 1/4 inch thick .
You want to be sure you apply the material at 20 mil , which is about the depth of 5 or 6 pieces of paper .
You can go to a local paint store and get a mil gauge , which is a metal wheel with notches cut out of it and showing the different mil rates .
Simply dip the gauge into the wet surface and read it .
You want to be sure to have an even distribution of Liquid Rubber .
Not applying enough will result in a thin membrane and will lead to inadequate adhesion and weak film strengths .
Over - applying is wasteful and may cause under -cure or long cure times .
Also , one common byproduct of over application is excessive swelling with some types of sheet - rubber roofs .
Surface preparation
Surface to be coated should be clean , dry and structurally sound .
Fasten loose areas with adhesive ( contact cement ) or pop rivets .
Oil or wax MUST be completely removed with solvent otherwise the product may swell and wrinkle and will not be covered under warranty .
We suggest applying one coat of the ProFlex Primer in the event you feel any oils or waxes cannot be removed .
Remove loose portions of existing coatings and brittle caulk with scraper and wire brush .
Whatever still has good adhesion may remain to be recoated .
Rusty or pitted metal should be wire brushed to remove loose oxide .
Tightly adhering corrosion may be directly coated with Liquid Roof® .
Liquid EPDM Rubber Mixing and Characteristics
One of the more popular characteristics of the Liquid EPDM Rubber is that it self - levels as the proper mill rate is achieved is applied versus the competition , where this needs to be addressed during the application .
If you view the mixing video on this page you will see that an electric drill and a mixing shaft are needed , which are available on our order form for purchase .
A rubber squeegee and short nap or med .
Nap roller are also required .
The short nap roller will smooth out any trapped air .
The squeegee is used to evenly distribute the Liquid Rubber EPDM .
Get a squeegee and a roller with a long handle to alleviate your need to do the entire project on your knees .
Standing up will be much easier .
When determining your overall square footage ( surface area ) , be sure to measure the true area .
For example , assume that you have a metal corrugated roof .
You need to look at the square footage of the raised areas of the roof and add that to your total square footage .
If this is your first time applying Liquid Rubber EPDM , we suggest you chalk your roof off into either 42 sq. ft. or 210 sq. ft. sections .
When you are done filling in the area you should be done with either that gallon or five gallon pail .
This is how you know you are applying it at the recommended spread rate .
We will use an example of 2 gallons for the remainder of this section .
Image you just received two gallons and will be applying them to the first section - a pre-measured , 80 sq. ft. section .
The key is to spread the product evenly because you do n’t want it too thick in some areas and too thin in other parts of the roof .
Next , let ’s discuss curing temperature .
In warm climates where daytime temps are in the 70s or 80s , Liquid EPDM will begin curing in four hours , so plan your sections knowing that you have 4 hours to work with the product before it starts its initial setup .
The application of the initial two gallons should not take your more than one hour , so you have plenty of time to do the job right .
This will give you an idea of the pace of your work .
You want to mix the Liquid Rubber EPDM until a vortex is created .
Five minutes is sufficient mixing time .
You will notice the catalyst in plastic bottles is a different color .
Do n’t worry ; it will not affect the color of the material after it is mixed thoroughly .
Note : the product will take light foot traffic after it is fully cured for workers to be able to get on the roof for inspections air conditioning work etc .
Applying EPDM Liquid Rubber
Here is what you will need :
Electric drill ( cordless drills will be effective )
A mixer for a can or pail . ( paddle mixer ) available on our order form
A rubber squeegee attached to a broom handle .
One Short nap roller approx .
1/4 ” attached to a broom handle .
Paint brush
Rubber spatula
Mineral spirits or Xylene for clean up
Bag of Rags
When using the broom handles it will allow you to apply the product standing up vs having to get on your knees .
The paintbrush is for the corners and hard to reach sections .
Broadcast the material in a letter “ S ” manner and then spread it using the squeegee .
Follow up with the ¼ ” nap roller to smoothen any trapped air and equitably distribute the EPDM Liquid Rubber® .
Any mistakes such as drips or platters should be cleaned off with rags .
The Xylene and / or mineral spirits should only be used on the Liquid EPDM when it is still wet not to exceed 4 hours after application .
Apply the Liquid EPDM
Now you are ready to begin .
There is no need to wait for the product once it is mixed .
Pour the two gallons of Liquid Rubber EPDM onto the pre-measured 80 sq. ft.area .
Use the rubber squeegee to quickly spread the product over the area as evenly as you can .
Remember that an even application is important .
Make sure that some areas are not thicker than others
Use the squeegee again for broadcasting the Liquid Rubber EPDM quickly and use the short nap roller to achieve even distribution and to release the trapped air bubbles .
Let the materials choose your application speed so the roller does n’t pull materials along .
Make several strokes with the roller to get an even and bubble - free application .
You may initially see some roller / brush strokes .
After a few minutes , it will change to form a smooth seamless membrane .
Liquid Rubber EPDM will be somewhat tacky for 12 hours .
It will still not be fully cured , but you will be able to walk on the roof / surface within three days .
Assuming temperatures are above 70° a full cure can be expected in 5 to 10 days .
Higher temperatures will decrease the curing time and lower temperatures will increase the time .
If the temperature falls below 55° take that into account .
When handing certain substrates like EPDM rubber sheets , you may see some lifting or swelling .
This is a result of the solvent being absorbed into the Liquid EPDM .
This is normal , and the swelling will shrink back given time and temperature .
If this has occurred , it is simply an aesthetics issue .
In temperatures of 80° or above , allow seven to 14 days for recovery .
In temperatures of 60° , it could take up to six weeks .
Liquid EPDM on Plywood and Wood Surfaces
When working with any wood application you first want to seal it with the ProFlex Primer .
Porous and unstable substrates will not accept the application and will result in an ineffective cure .
When working with applications over existing painted wood , clean the surface with soap and water to rid it of residual oils , debris and dirt .
Scrape off any flaking areas .
If you have washed the roof , ensure that enough days have passed so that any water absorbed into the wood has evaporated .
When working with large commercial roofing applications , inspect the joints and seams .
If there are any gaps 1/16 inch or larger , you will need reinforcement or filling .
Wood application are not covered by warranty as it is impossible to verify the condition of the wood i.e. rotten wood or wood that has absorbed water .
Tar - Asphalt - Elastomeric Coatings
EPDM Liquid Roof / EPDM
Liquid Rubber cannot be applied directly to these surfaces .
Any of the above , as well as any third party coatings that you are not sure of , must be coated first with the ProFlex Primer .
This will ensure a stable substrate for the Liquid EPDM rubber .
Strength and Durability
EPDM Liquid Rubber will demonstrate all of the chemical characteristics that have made it so successful .
UV and ozone stability , excellent resistance to ponding water , and long - term retention of significant temperature changes are all benefits .
It is always applied to an existing surface , so the current condition of the surface will have a factor in determining the overall life of the roof .
However , a realistic expectation is 14 - 15 years before a recoat is needed .
A caution about ALPHA rubber .
Some manufacturers use “ Alpha brand rubber ” such as Fleetwood .
Refer to your owners manuel or contact them directly .
If you do have an Aphla roof you will need the ProFlex Primer
Spraying Liquid EPDM
Rubber
There are more details on spraying in our brochure , which can be printed from our website .
Airless equipment needs only one hose from pump to gun , but it must generate pressures of 3,500 to 4,000 psi , and specific hose length needs to be used due high pressure drops .
Air - atomized equipment requires two hoses to the gun , making it more cumbersome to maneuver .
It also requires the addition of a compressor .
Equipment Specifications
PUMP is capable of delivering three to four gallons per minute at 3,500 to 4,000 psi HOSE if 3/8 - inch ID max .
Permissible length is 150 feet when using a .019 tip if 1/2 - inch ID maximum .
Permissible length is 200 feet when using a .21 tip .
Recoating Liquid Roof
Liquid Roof dries ( cures ) through a chemical process , and a single heavy application is better than multiple thin coats .
A second application will certainly adhere to the first coat , but the bond will not be as strong .
If your second coat is applied before the first has dried , some wrinkling may result due to the absorption of the solvent .
This wrinkling will reduce over time as the solvent evaporates from below .
Should you have any questions about your particular application , you can call our Sales staff at 855-281-0940 ( ext 2 ) .

The woman who claims that she was sexually assaulted by Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger has faced a flood of evidence tending to show that she has fabricated the allegations for financial gain .
In an admitted effort to combat the appearance that it ’s all about the money ( which , of course , will cause many to believe that it really is all about the money ) , her lawyer has offered to dismiss the case in exchange for an admission from Roethlisberger that the incident occurred , along with a $ 100,000 donation to the Committee to Aid Abused Women .
Per the Associated Press , lawyer David Cornwell said that the offer will be rejected .
And , frankly , that ’s the right decision .
The evidence generated to date will make it very difficult for the woman to persuade a jury that non-consensual sex occurred between herself and Roethlisberger , which supports the notion that the case represents a money grab .
So why would Roethlisberger admit guilt ?
The fact that she ’d drop the case in exchange for an apology and a donation to charity reflects , in our view , a desperate attempt to divert attention away from proof indicating that the claims are grossly exaggerated at best , flat - out made up at worst .
But given the enormous damage such an admission would do to his image and off - field earning potential , Roethlisberger would n’t admit to raping the accuser if she were paying him $ 10 million to do it — especially since , as it appears based on the evidence generated to date , he is innocent .
As these two sides try the case in the court of public opinion , hollow stunts like this wo n’t persuade anyone that she ’s telling the truth , based on the proof that has been introduced by the lawyers representing Roethlisberger and the accuser ’s co-workers at Harrah’s .
If the accuser and her lawyer hope to make people think that Roethlisberger did it , they need to come up with facts , not offers that they know Roethlisberger will never accept .
Moreover , the fact that the letter is coming to light two days before the Steelers host the Titans in the regular - season opener shows the accuser ’s only real leverage against Roethlisberger flows from the potential distraction the case can create — and that she ’s willing to use it .
But this is a development that should only make Roethlisberger feel better about the case , because if his accuser truly believed she had been raped , she surely would n’t be willing to walk away in exchange for a piece of paper in which the man who raped her says , “ Oops. Sorry . ”
Obama was supposed to give a harmless talk on how school children should own up their responsibilities and start acting more maturely .
According to a White House spokesman ( according to CNN ) :
" The goal of the speech and the lesson plans is to challenge students to work hard , stay in school and dramatically reduce the dropout rate .
This is n't a policy speech .
It 's a speech designed to encourage kids to stay in school . "
In other words , this is something Obama is deeply committed for and has spoken about that several times even during his election campaign .
But the lunatic right wing has begun to oppose the speech even before it is read out .
Why ?
Because they feel Obama will try to push his " socialist " agenda through children and try to indoctrinate them with this " communist " ideology .
Several fringey parents are supposedly calling up their childrens ' schools and asking them not to show the online address to the kids .
And need I talk about Glenn Beck and Hannity jumping into this ?
Anyways , this entire episode reminded me of George Bush 's approach to educating the youth of America .
Does n't anyone still remember how remarkably hilarious it was ?
Well , here 's a sampler ...

Sid ’s Top 20 Places Inspiration Strikes
Hiking .
Maybe only a step removed from “ long walks in the countryside ” – hiking up and across ridges gets me away from everything .
I can put aside my software development and todo list for an afternoon to get some perspective – and oftentimes , some new ideas about my life , and topics to write about .
If nothing else , it ’s an afternoon spent with friends exploring areas that I have taken for granted all this time .
People Watching at the Mall .
I love eating at food courts , but not always for the food – I go so I can people watch .
Looking at people from different places and hearing different languages reminds me what a small part of the world I am , and how few of the people I know .
It inspires me to get out and connect with more people , and sometimes seeing people younger and older than me gets me thinking about my life .
Running On The Treadmill .
I throw on some of my favorite workout music , get in a zone , and just let my mind wander while my legs take care of the running .
At the end of it Inot only have I got in a good workout , I usually have a couple ideas for new things to implement in my life , some ideas for articles to write .
Lying In Bed .
This is the worst offender , and I wish I could have my epiphanies 10 minutes earlier – before I ’m comfortably lying down .
It happens to me all the time : I turn out the lights , and just as I drift off to sleep an idea hits me , and I have to write it down before I forget .
It happens so often that I have a journal with a reading light and pencil sitting next to my bed – and I use it a few times a week .
Sitting On An Airplane – I travel frequently , for both work and pleasure .
One of the best parts about sitting on an airplane is it ’s one of the few times I can use my computer without being distracted by random websites or overloaded by email .
Sometimes I read , and sometimes I just think while I stare out the window – at the top of clouds , at cities below , or just the pitch black night sky .
TED .
I ’ve used TED videos to demonstrate some of my posts already – Altruism – One of the Keys to Happiness , and my Tribes By Seth Godin – Book Review .
For a while I was watching 1 - 4 videos a week – brilliant people discussing fascinating subjects .
Almost every video I watch expands my mind in some way , and leaves me with a new perspective .
Long Night Time Freeway Drives –
After dinner or seeing friends I love how calm it is driving home .
Sometime I put on some music , while other times I like to just enjoy the silence while my hands take me home on auto pilot .
When there are almost no other cars on the road , and it ’s just me and the world passing me by I see places I used to go , think about the past , the present , the future – and the possibilities seem endless .
Watching Clouds .
Maybe it ’s because it reminds me of the past and my childhood – or maybe it ’s just because I like looking for funny shapes in the sky .
Whatever the reason , looking at clouds relaxes me and helps me take my mind off all the different commitments I have – and inspires me to do new things .
The Ocean .
I can see sandy beach from my balcony and living room window .
Looking out there reminds me that I ’m just a small part of this big world , and of how lucky I am – I can see the ocean from my window !
After a few minutes of watching the waves , I get back to work – sometimes with new ideas ;)
The Mirror .
I look at the mirror every day when I ” m getting ready – but usually my mind is wandering and I ” m just going from one thing to the next – brush teeth , floss , mouthwash , rinse , check hair …
Occasionally though I ’ll pause in the middle of my routine and really look at myself in the mirror – think about who I am , where I ’ve been and where I ’m going .
It amazes me how many days go by where I look in the mirror , but do n’t really notice my own reflection .
Lunch With A Friend .
I go out to eat most days , and more often than not grab lunch with a friend – sometimes people I have n’t seen in months or years .
Seeing what others have been up to , catching up with where they are in their life and where they ’ve been often leaves me with new perspectives , and a longing to try some of the things they have been up to .
Sunrise and Sunsets .
Not only can I see the ocean from my apartment – I ’m lucky enough to be able to see the sunset upon the water as well .
I occasionally am up early enough to see the sunrise , if I ’m willing to drive somewhere with a good view of it .
Seeing the day start and end is amazing , and often inspires me to to better as the day begins , and reflect on the day as it is ending .
In The Shower .
I do n’t do candle - lit baths , but in between singing , rinsing and repeating the privacy , comfort and peace of my shower gives me some time alone to think .
More often than not , I come out not just refreshed and clean – but also reenergized and inspired .
Old Journals .
I am amazed at the things I find in my old journals .
I have physical pieces of paper , text files on my computer and archives of old websites where I used to write my thoughts .
Often I cringe at my writing and immaturity , but occasionally will find nuggets full of naive optimism : my uncomplicated , uncompromising hopes and dreams .
It takes me back to where I was , and reminds me a lot of what Michael Bungay Stanier calls Great Work : changing the world , making a difference .
The Airport Lounge .
This is the moment to me when anything is possible .
I often think about how amazing it is – in 5 or 10 hours I will be in a completely different world , with different people .
I ’ll have traveled so far and be o far removed from my previous location on the giant rock we call a planet that my watch will no longer no what time it is .
Everything and everyone that is at my departure will physically be so far from me as to not be a part of my world for days , weeks or months .
I also like people watching here as well – many people think they are completely invisible in an airport =) Staring At The Stars .
No matter how much time passes , staring at the stars provides some stability .
My hiking trails and the beach change year to year as the earth erodes and the tides change , but the stars are constant .
Twitter .
While more often than not I need to avoid wasting time online , sometimes I ’ll see conversations , quotes or interesting links on Twitter that inspire me .
The mix of people I follow on Twitter gives me tons of food for thought – from NBA stars , entrepreneurs , and sometimes even people I know in real life ; ) .
A Blank Page .
When I ca n’t seem to focus on my work and feel distracted in some way , like there ’s something on my mind but I do n’t know what it is , I ’ll grab my journal and just start writing .
I ’m amazed at the amount of things that spill out – thoughts I did n’t even realize I had , that were just bubbling below the surface .
The Throne .
Saving the best ( or worst ! ) for last .
Who has n’t had one of those moments – sitting in the bathroom , pondering life or the latest Seinfeld episode when inspiration hits ?
I have n’t put a journal in there yet – these moments are few and far between = ) .
There you have it .
I know what you ’re thinking – where ’s # 20 ?
I lied – I only have 19 , and I ’m going to need some help finishing it up .
Feel free to leave a comment with your feedback – are you favorites on the list ?
Or are there any that you would add ?
Enjoy this artcle ?

Claim : Cabbage Patch dolls were designed to get people accustomed to the appearance of mutants following a thermonuclear war or were modeled upon mentally defective children .
FALSE
Examples :
[ Collected on the Internet , 2000 ]
One legend that I have heard a few times ( mostly back in the late 80’s and early 90’s ) was that President Reagan had the company that produced Cabbage Patch dolls make them intentionally ugly .
This legend maintains that government scientists thought that this is what the offspring of survivors of a nuclear war would look like .
By familiarizing people with this “ look ” , the survival of the human race would be ensured .
Other versions of this story I have heard say that it was the CIA ’s idea , and that the government had actually exposed people to high levels of radiation and had them reproduce to get “ models ” to help in designing the dolls .
[ Collected on the Internet , 2002 ]
My boyfriend said recently that there had been a news report in the 80’s that said that the design of cabbage patch dolls was patterned after mentally disabled children .
Origins : Cabbage Patch Kids took the toy market by storm in 1983 .
That Christmas they became the “ must have ” gift adults scrambled for madly in toy store
scuffles .
Tales were rampant about parents who were willing to pay anything — or go anywhere — to obtain these dolls for their youngsters , including that of a Kansas City , Missouri , postman who flew to London to buy one for his daughter .
Demand quickly outstripped supply , and many who sought these elusive prizes came home empty - handed .
The madness seemingly knew no bounds ; for example , a Milwaukee radio DJ convinced two dozen people to stand in Milwaukee County Stadium , with American Express cards raised to the sky , expecting an airborne delivery of 2,000 Cabbage Patch Kids .
What could cause such an uproar ?
What was there about Cabbage Patch Kids that inspired such determination ?
There was something universally appealing about the dolls themselves .
They were lovable in a manner other dolls could only forlornly aspire to in their plastic , mass - produced way .
They were soft .
They were huggable .
And they were unique — no two were alike .
Best of all , no one could merely purchase them : they had to be adopted , instantly turning their proud pint - size possessors into “ parents . ”
Each Cabbage Patch doll came with a certificate of adoption from Babyland General Hospital , a place , one was told , where “ doctors ” and “ nurses ” watched over the big-eyed , chubby - cheeked tykes until they were old enough to be placed with loving families .
Each certificate stated the doll ’s name and birth date , and had to be filled out and returned to Babyland General by the new parent to complete the adoption process .
The “ Kids ” were not created as part of an evil government plot to accustom folks to what we ’d look like after a nuclear holocaust , nor to foster acceptance of the mentally disadvantaged by conditioning us to a specific look .
They were the creation of Xavier Roberts , an artist who traveled
from his Georgia mountain home to regional crafts fairs selling hand - stitched dolls .
He vended the first of these dolls in 1978 , but they came to national prominence only after he entered into a distribution agreement with toymaker Coleco in 1983 .
Computer - based manufacturing ensured that each doll continued to be just a little bit different from all the others .
Although their popularity has diminished somewhat from those first years of Cabbage Patch mania , these dolls are still much sought after .
Mattel took over from Coleco in 1995 , and by 2000 more than 90 million “ Kids ” had been adopted .
It is our nature to look for the sinister where none exists , which explains the prevalence of these two rumors about the dolls ’ origins .
A student in the Wheeling , West Virginia , area claimed to have been part of a group that began the “ nuclear holocaust ” falsehood around 1984 and would probably be mightily surprised to discover this bit of college - boy silliness persists to this day .
However , rumors live on because something in each of them speaks to something in us , and this theme of looking for evil lurking in the shadows of paradise is an enthralling one .
We ’ve been told an article about Cabbage Patch dolls coming to life and strangling their owners appeared in the National Enquirer in the late 1980s .
It detailed the experiences of a number of women longing for babies of their own who had adopted Cabbage Patch dolls and treated them as if they were real .
Satan possessed the dolls and inspired them to murder the hapless women .
( That the “ murderous possessed doll ” was the theme of the Child ’s Play films featuring Chuckie likely did n’t persuade many of the National Enquirer ‘s readers that the article was n’t an instance of hard news reporting . )
That article may have spawned a variant of the “ sinister origins ” rumor , one that asserted the dolls had been designed by Satanists .
Cabbage Patch Kids are plagued by another rumor , one involving dolls supposedly returned to the factory for repairs .
In that rumor , children who hopefully await their dolls ’ return are saddened to receive a death certificate instead .
Cabbage Patch Kids were the first toys to inspire the overpowering urge to acquire that other playthings ( such as Tickle Me Elmo dolls ) later emulated .
Because they were the first , they made an impact on the culture surrounding them , sparking stories that gave voice to an vague sense of uneasiness associated with anything kid-related that became so popular so quickly .
Satanists , government conspiracies , killer dolls , a hard - hearted corporation that dispatches death certificates to teary - eyed tykes — each of these is a manifestation through storytelling of that underlying sense of disquiet .

Concerned that the growing popularity of big - screen televisions could make it harder for California to keep pace with electricity demand , state energy regulators are poised to crack down on energy - guzzling sets despite opposition from a powerful electronics trade group .
The first - in - the - nation TV efficiency standards would require electronics retailers to sell only energy - sipping models starting in 2011 .
Even tougher efficiency criteria would follow in 2013 .
The California Energy Commission is slated to unveil the new standards today , followed by a 45 - day public comment period .
The commission is expected to approve the measure in early November .
The rules , which took more than a year to develop , are designed to shave $ 8.1 billion off Californians ’ electricity bills over a 10 - year - period .
That works out to $ 30 per set per year , according to commission officials .
Advertisement
It will also help California utilities head off the need to build more power plants just so residents can watch “ American Idol ” and other shows .
TVs already account for 10 % of residential energy use in California , driven largely by surging demand for large - screen TVs .
Strict state mandates for cutting greenhouse gas emissions are further pressuring officials to act .
“ Increased efficiency is the most cost - effective way of meeting our renewable - energy goals , ” commission Chairwoman Karen Douglas said .
Environmentalists have applauded those efforts .
But some industry groups , including the Consumer Electronics Assn. , dispute the notion that the new efficiency rules would benefit consumers .
About a quarter of currently available television models would have to be pulled from store shelves , said Doug Johnson , senior director for technology policy with the Arlington , Va. , group that represents TV makers , distributors , retailers and installers .
Advertisement
That could raise television prices , put home theater installers and wholesalers out of business and destroy jobs , he said .
The association contends that the regulations would force TV buyers to buy banned sets from out - of - state dealers over the Internet , depriving California retailers of customers and state and local governments of needed sales tax and corporate income tax revenue .
The commission “ appears to be carelessly rushing this flawed regulatory proposal that sets arbitrary limits on TV energy usage , ” Johnson said .
He said the group ’s members have come up with a number of ideas for making their products more efficient but want to do them voluntarily .
But some flat - panel - TV makers said they would have no trouble hitting the higher efficiency threshold and that TV buyers would n’t see prices rise .
Hundreds of top - selling large - screen and very large - screen digital models already comply with the proposed efficiency standards .
Advertisement
“ The average Californian should not see a cost premium , ” Bruce Berkoff , chairman of the LCD TV Assn. , said in a letter to the Energy Commission .
“ They will , however , benefit from dozens to hundreds of dollars in energy cost savings over their TV ’s lifetime , thus making the proposed standard extremely cost - effective for the state of California . ”
The Energy Commission ’s move is just the latest step in a long push for energy efficiency in California .
Since 1975 , the Golden State has led the nation in adopting tough energy standards for household appliances , homes and buildings .
As a result , California ’s per-capita electricity consumption has remained flat for nearly three decades , while the rest of the country ’s power demand has grown 50 % .
Yet California ’s energy needs are so vast , it still must import about 30 % of its electricity from out of state .
Continued conservation , officials say , is critical to ensure California has enough electricity to keep its economy growing and healthy .
Big -screen
TVs have emerged as a potential monkey wrench in the state ’s energy planning .
Advertisement
Sales of large , flat - screen TVs boomed in recent years , spurred by consumer desire for home theaters , the development of high - definition digital signals and a ratcheting down of retail prices .
But many of the 40 - inch - and - larger sets , which use liquid crystal or plasma technology , consume vast amounts of electricity .
The average plasma screen uses more than three times as much energy as a bulky , old - fashioned cathode - ray - tube TV .
Research shows that television viewing now accounts for about 2 % of statewide electricity consumption , a percentage that is expected to steadily increase .
Advertisement
Commission analysts estimate that a switch to higher - efficiency sets would eliminate the need to build one large natural - gas - fired electric power plant , saving enough energy to run about 461,000 homes .
The proposed standards would require televisions with 58 - inch screens or smaller to comply with a minimum efficiency standard by Jan. 1 , 2011 , and a more stringent one by Jan. 1 , 2013 .
Sets with screens larger than 58 inches would initially be exempt from the new standards .
But they would be subject to a subsequent rule - making process .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , who appoints the members of the independent Energy Commission but plays no role in its decisions , “ supports the CEC ’s approach , ” spokesman Aaron McLear said .
Advertisement
Some television manufacturers , including Irvine - based Vizio Inc. , are on board as well .
“ We . . . support the standard , and we are in a position to comply with proposed effective dates but would also support earlier implementation , ” Kenneth R. Lowe , Vizio ’s co-founder and vice president , wrote to the commission late last year .
He noted that his company already “ has several LCD models in the market today ” that meet the more stringent 2013 standard .
Plasma TVs , which use significantly more power , currently would have trouble meeting the standards but could do so “ in the next couple of years with expected technological innovations , ” Lowe said .

Those Socialist Americans
A quarter of the American people ( 26 percent , to be exact ) , according to Friday morning ’s New York Times / CBS
News poll , believe that the health - care reform bills floating around Congress will create governmental death panels , while just 23 percent say they wo n’t .
Another 30 percent believe that the bills will allow federal tax dollars to go towards the purchase of insurance by illegal immigrants , while just 22 percent say they wo n’t .
The right - wing noise machine has evidently reached many right - wing ears .
But here ’s the stunner :
In the very same poll , respondents were asked whether they favored a Medicare - like public option for everyone .
The right - wingers were out there in roughly the same numbers that they registered in answering the other questions : 26 percent of respondents said they opposed the public option .
But a whopping 65 supported it .
Think about that .
The public option has been demonized non -stop for the past half - year ; it ’s the key to the Republican charge that instituting such a program is tantamount to bringing socialism to America .
They have clearly rallied the Republican base to this position , just as they rallied the base to fear the coming of death panels and publicly - subsidized immigrant care .
But whereas pluralities of Americans simply said they did n’t know enough to believe one thing or the other about death panels and immigrant care , virtually all Americans not in the Republican base support the public option .
Here , the question is n’t whether the bills working their way through Congress say X or Y .
The question is whether a public option would be a good deal for the American people , and the American people have answered that it would .
They have surely heard the claims that it would be the socialist nose in the capitalist tent , and the only logical inference is that they actually support socialism ( not too likely ) or that they do n’t think it would constitute an embrace of socialism -- at least , no more than such other government programs as Medicare or public utilities have constituted that .
Since Republican legislators represent the 26 percent of Americans opposed to the public option , their opposition to same poses no mystery .
The conundrum is why some Democrats -- all save those from the most right - wing districts -- oppose it .
When The Post ’s uber - policy blogger Ezra Klein asked North Dakota Democratic Senator Kent Conrad yesterday why he did n’t support the public option , Conrad replied , “ I do n't think a government - run plan best fits this culture . ”
In Conrad ’s mind , such as it is , American culture does n’t seem to be shaped by the American people .
Is the intensity of the support for the public option as great as that of the opposition ?
Apparently not , at least , not yet .
Does a 65 - percent - to - 26 - percent margin nonetheless give the Democrats the ability to defend the public option and actually win support for doing so ?
It does if they ’re any good at their chosen trade .
The American people have just told the Democrats , If you vote for the public option , we ’ve got your back .
Of course , if Democrats are utterly spineless , having their back yields nothing .
Blizzard Planning Pseudo - LAN
Support for StarCraft 2 , Diablo 3 to Follow Suit
" We are working on solutions with regard to things we can do to maintain connectivity to Battle .
net in some way , but also provide a great quality connection between players , " said Canessa .
Blizzard recently announced that traditional LAN play would not be included in the game , with offline play only being allowed in the singleplayer campaign .
I asked Canessa whether the solution his team is working on might include a pseudo - LAN connection , where the game would only check in with Battle .
net to authenticate before reverting to typical LAN behavior .
" Something like that , " he replied .
" Maintaining a connection with Battle .net , I do n't know if it 's once or periodically , but then also having a peer - to - peer connection between players to facilitate a very low - ping , high - bandwidth connection ..
those are the things that we 're working on . "
Diablo III lead designer Jay Wilson also confirmed that Diablo III will treat LAN in the same way that StarCraft II does , meaning that while traditional offline LAN will not be included in that game , it should support any Battle .
net solution developed for the RTS .
Thomas Pynchon : Ectoplasm Smeared on a Motherboard
The internet is burnin ' like a tire fire !
Did mysterious recluse Thomas Pynchon narrate the book trailer to his new book " Inherent Vice ?
" Here 's all we have to compare it against : Everybody knows that Thomas Pynchon hates the public spotlight , if not public spectacle .
Grab any schoolchild off the street and carry them into a dark alley .
Push them up against a brick wall underneath a fire escape , let their chubby legs dangle free , and ask them : " WHO IS THOMAS PYNCHON ?
" And they will say : " I DON'T KNOW !
" One assumes , however , that he is all over the internet , adopting different pseudonyms and postures , creating scandals and mysteries while checking his email during big banana breakfasts before he sits down to write new books .
Perhaps he is an emergent property of the internet itself !
If you really want to get to know him , you can read his massive tomes -- books by turns so fucking boring and so fucking genius -- that they reveal a portrait of a big - ol ' weirdo with a giddy sense of humor , unbalanced by an overwhelming sadness that the greatest ambitions of the 1960 's radicals were never realized .
He does n't know it ( how could he ? ) but his fiction IS the realization of these greatest ambitions .
But you want his flesh .
So look him in his young face and try to see his future !
A fiction writer to the bone !
A fiction writer to the very bone !
NOTE : You want the truth ?
Thomas Pynchon is the first sentient computer program , coded by Philip K . Dick during a pink speed haze in the early sixties .
Many of Dick 's science fiction novels were heavily edited PYNCHON texts .
When Dick died , PYNCHON was purchased by Michael Jackson who sold reams of PYNCHON to struggling creative artists in the 1980's , giving birth to both the transgressive sitcom serial ( " Alf , " " Seinfeld " ) and punk rock .
PYNCHON is a huge punchcard program , and over time , deterioration and mismanagement of the card system has led to delightful error - gaps that make current PYNCHON texts far from perfect ( most of Jackson 's peculiar misjudgments in style and behavior were a result of consulting PYNCHON for advice about the future of art ) .
When PYNCHON is not tasked with narrative , the computer scientists that manage him at UCLA use the program to get laid , using PYNCHON dialog in online chat rooms in order to seduce lonely California intellectuals .
To say that PYNCHON is inhuman is correct .
To say that PYNCHON is without a soul is a metaphysical stand I am unwilling to take .
Paint them white and these amazing structures remind me strongly of something you would see in Star Wars …
The Maunsell Army Sea Forts are possibly the only valid reason I can think of to visit Shoeburyness East where they can be seen from boat , or beach on a clear day .
I love them – I guess in much the same way I find Dungeness ( and it ’s mini steam train ) appealing .
They are also one of my favorite pieces of architecture .
Constructed in 1942 these astonishing structures were anti-aircraft tower - forts constructed in 1942 to form part of the Thames Estuary defense network .
Each fort consists of a cluster of seven stilted buildings surrounding a central command tower .
It is now dangerous and illegal to try and visit the forts due to their bad state of decay – personally considering the money wasted in the UK surely some pennies must be found to help preserve these astonishing structures .

( CNN ) -- A French filmmaker who recently finished a documentary about a violent street gang in El Salvador was found shot dead in the town of Tonacatepeque , about 10 miles northeast of the capital city of San Salvador , authorities said .
French documentary filmmaker Christian Poveda was found shot dead 10 miles northeast of San Salvador .
Christian Poveda , 52 , was shot at least four times in the face , according to local reports .
Poveda 's documentary , " La Vida Loca , " which follows the lives of members of the Mara 18 street gang , had been screened at a handful of film festivals and is slated for wider release later this month .
His body was found in an area controlled by that same gang , local reports said .
A motive of Poveda 's murder Wednesday was being investigated , National Civil Police Director Carlos Ascencio Giron said in a statement .
Citing the pending investigation , police did not immediately give any details , but Ascencio Giron said that the homicide and organized crime divisions of his department were handling the case jointly with the attorney general 's office .
Salvadoran President Mauricio
Funes said he was " very shocked " by the news of the murder .
According to a statement by the president 's office , Poveda first arrived in El Salvador in the 1980s to cover the civil war as a photojournalist .
He left to report from other war zones , but returned to research and film the gangs in El Salvador .

Poveda on Wednesday was traveling in his car after filming in a town called Soyapango when unknown assailants intercepted him and then shot him , according to the statement .
The homicide sector chief for the National Civil Police , Marco Tulio Lima , told the newspaper El Diario de Hoy that police detained one person in connection to the killing , but did not say if the person was a suspect .
" Christian Poveda 's recent film about El Salvador 's street gangs provided a powerful inside look into youth violence in one of Central America 's most dangerous regions , " said Carlos Lauria of the Committee to Protect Journalists .
" We urge the authorities to conduct a prompt and exhaustive inquiry into his murder and bring all those responsible to justice . "
In March , " La Vida Loca " was a hit with audiences at the Guadalajara International Film Festival in Mexico , the organization told CNN through a spokesman .
Poveda gave himself fully to his work and spent years following the Mara 18 , the festival spokesman said .
" Creating documentary implies working for the love of the profession , and that was what our friend Christian showed us in the short time that we had the opportunity to know him , " the Film Festival said in a statement .
The producer of Poveda 's documentary , Carole Solive , told The Guardian newspaper that , " He went out alone . . . to get back in touch with the gang whose story he had filmed . "
" But their boss was in prison and he found himself in the middle of very restless young capos who , for the first time , asked him for money , " she said .

Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi says much of Africa 's violence is due to foreign meddling and that Israel in particular is to blame for stoking conflicts there .
Gaddafi's comments came Monday during an extraordinary African Union summit scheduled to coincide with a celebration of the 40th anniversary of the coup that brought Gaddafi to power .

The Libyan leader blamed much of Africa 's violence on what he described as intervention by unnamed " foreign powers , " bent on plundering Africa 's natural resources .
While Gaddafi and other African leaders often blame foreign hands for stoking internal divisions , this was one of the most explicit and targeted Gaddafi outbursts in many years .
Like most Arab countries , Libya does not recognize Israel .
A Pennsylvania history buff who recreates firearms from old wars accidentally fired a 2 - pound cannonball through the wall of his neighbor 's home in Uniontown , Pa .
William Maser , 54 , fired a cannonball Wednesday evening outside his home in Georges Township that ricocheted and hit a house 400 yards away .
The cannonball , about two inches in diameter , smashed through a window and a wall before landing in a closet .
Authorities said nobody was hurt .
State police charged Maser with reckless endangerment , criminal mischief and disorderly conduct .
No one answered the phone Friday at Maser 's home .
He told WPXI - TV that recreating 19th - century cannons is a longtime hobby .
He said he is sorry and he will stop shooting them on his property , about 35 miles southeast of Pittsburgh .
Newspapers were struck a death blow by Craigslist - We all know that story .
But what was it like when Craisglist just got started and we did not know that was going to happen ?
What will it be like when a new " Craigslist " enters a new sector with all the potential to disrupt ?
Well today I read 4 articles that lead me to believe that Universities - as we know them - are DEAD !
The Death Star has arrived and in the end - there can be no defence .
Article 1 - The NYT - 25 % of kids are unemployed - this includes most graduates who also have large student loans .
If they get jobs it is in the McJob world .
It will take years for this to change - see my post below - meanwhile the debt has to be paid and the summer jobs are not there .
But if you do n't have a degree - there is no employment that will pay enough to raise a middle class family - so there is a paradox
Article 2 - Why University costs are so high and so impossible to cut - basically the President has no power over the faculty - like the print union at the paper - the faculty have a lock on how work is done and how they are paid and will not give this up .
Article 3 ( Via John Robb )
A story on a new way of getting a degree on your own at your own pace for $ 99 a course at Straightline .
A real degree using all the same material with better access to teaching - all at your onw pace and time - all at home .
Article 4 the link ( John Robb ) to Straighterline - a very neat idea
Here why I say DEATH .
If universities cannot change their costs .
If unemployment for the young lasts a decade and the only way of paying is debt - then the " smart " kids and parents will find " smart " alternatives .
Straighterline is maybe the Craigslist challenge .
It 's all about the economics - is n't it ?
What do you think ?

Arsène Wenger stepped away from signing the teenage prodigy who was picked up from the French side Le Havre by Manchester United and whose case leaves the Premier League champions under the threat of a transfer ban , The Independent has learned .
Though Arsenal have been by no means immune from claims over the years that they have unfairly poached young players , the president of Le Havre , Jean Pierre Louvel , has insisted they acted honourably in the case of Paul Pogba , the defensive midfielder and captain of the France Under 16s , when told he was not sale .
" Arsenal were also following him but we told them he was not for sale and they have the [ grace ] to stop trying to buy him .
Not so Manchester , " said M Louvel .
" I 'm fed up that some clubs can steal players from us like this . "
Le Havre seem intent on making United pay heavily for the loss of Pogba , however long it takes .
M Louvel declared that his club would pursue the case with the same vigour as Lens , whose complaint to Fifa about Chelsea 's pursuit of Gaël Kakuta has prompted Fifa 's decision that Chelsea shall be banned from the market for two transfer windows .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" The Lens case took two years and so ours will probably last just as long which is a shame , " he said .
" I hope that Manchester will find themselves with the same problems that Chelsea are now facing .
We have to stop this haemorrhaging of players from France to England .
We 're not going to be able to get the player back at the end of the process but I believe there will be strong signals given as there were in the Lens case and in future that will mean clubs like these will be less tempted to take such young players . "
There are serious doubts in France that Le Havre , who are yet to lodge a complaint with Fifa , have the same strength case as Lens did over Chelsea 's conduct in the acquisition of Kakuta .
While Kakuta was tied to a contract aspirant – an agreement French youngsters sign at 16 committing them to signing a full professional contract at a later date – Pogba and his parents had signed a bridging agreement , a contract de non solicitation , enforceable in France though not necessarily elsewhere and primarily designed to stave off rival French clubs before the aspirant is signed .
Manchester United are understood to be extremely confident that anything Pogba signed did not amount to a legally binding contract and that they were quite within their rights to pursue their player .
But then again , so did Chelsea , who will not receive Fifa 's full legal grounds for their transfer ban for several weeks , but have been stunned by a decision which they will take to the Court for Arbitration in Sport , possibly in December .
The way that Le Havre say they discovered United 's interest in their strapping defensive midfielder says everything about why France is in such a state of indignation with Premier League clubs ' propensity for taking the stars of its legendary Clairefontaine facility .
In mid-May of this year , the club heard of internet reports suggesting that Pogba was the subject of interest from Manchester United and Arsenal , and that United were intent on signing him .
The club were concerned , knowing the potential of a player they signed from Torcy , a side from a rough Parisien suburb .
The club 's managing director Alain Belsoeur told The Independent yesterday that he had initially faxed the United chief executive , David Gill , " to say that the player is under contract to us . "
In response , there was a telephone call from United 's academy director , Brian McClair , and several fax exchanges .
" We put on paper and clearly explained that he was under contract to us . "
But the player , who will be 16 next March , left .
United insist they have made no payments to the player and reject suggestions from sources in France that the Le Havre club and the player 's father were each paid € 100,000 and that the player 's mother was also offered € 100,000 and a house .
Pogba has indicated to friends in France that he expects a salary of € 180,000 a month in two years , when he signs full professional terms .
Though Le Havre say they want sanctions against United similar to the transfer embargo imposed upon Chelsea , Fifa had received no correspondence from the club as of last night and , in a bizarre twist to what promises to be a long period of legal activity around the issue of British clubs signing young continental prodigies , United may be the club forced to take Le Havre to court over Pogba .
The French side have taken the unusual step of asking the French Football Federation to refuse to provide the necessary international transfer certificate ( ITC ) for Pogba to play in Britain , which means as yet he has been unable to play for United .
United 's only means of securing one must come through an appeal to Fifa .
Le Havre also asked the French federation not to accept Pogba into any of the national youth sides , a sanction similar to the one which Mikaël Silvestre was hit with after leaving for Internazionale from Rennes in 1998 .
Pogba has subsequently not appeared for the French Under - 16 or - 17 sides .
Though other European countries have complained equally bitterly of losing their brightest young players to the riches of Britain 's club , France appears to be alone in its belief that its contractual arrangements are strong enough to secure punishments of the kind that Chelsea have incurred .
Fiorentina confirmed yesterday that they are going ahead with an official complaint to Uefa over United 's signing of their Under - 16 captain , Michele Fornasier and Reggina have lodged a similar complaint over the loss of Vincenzo Camilleri to Chelsea .
These players were under 16 , and therefore too young to be tied to contracts which would keep foreign clubs at bay .
But several sources in Italy suggested yesterday that the contractual positions of its young players were incomparable with those in France .
While Chelsea sought a way out of the disaster , the agent that was involved in securing Kakuta 's services , Roger Boli , was keeping his head down .
" I do n't want to talk about this , " he told The Independent .
" I have nothing to say . "
Player poaching : Italy and Germany
Italian clubs , who have suffered more than French from British clubs ' interest in their young players , are lobbying Uefa to tighten up laws governing the transfers of under - 18s overseas .
Manchester United 's youth team are generally a good guide to the cream of Italian youth , with the loss of Federico Macheda and Davide Petrucci from Lazio and Roma a source of angst before Michele Fornasier headed the same way from Fiorentina .
It was Macheda 's case earlier this year which raised the issue of Premier League clubs moving for 15 - year - olds , with Italian clubs hidebound by their inability to sign them up under the age of 16 .
" They tempt parents with big money and offers of work , without any ethical codes , " Lazio president Claudio Lotito said at the time .
" All these players are stolen as a matter of course . "
Reggina 's complaint to Uefa and the Italian football federation over the loss of Vincenzo Camilleri is also under consideration .
Borussia Dortmund were not happy either , when they lost Stephen Sama and Christopher Buchtmann to Liverpool from their academy , though Germany is not understood to support the idea of a Uefa ban on clubs signing foreign players under the age of 18 , principally because that would limit its potential to hire from its own sizeable immigrant communities .
But France is perhaps bound to feel the sting of indignation more than most .
Some of its finest young players are also to be found in the Italian leagues , as they have been since the departures of Mikael Silvestre and his Rennes team - mate Ousmane Dabo to Inter was a source of national indignation 11 years ago .
The best league in the world is back .

The public option has not been taken off the table in the nation 's healthcare debate , President Barack Obama flatly declared Sunday .
Obama , appearing on the Spanish - language Univision 's " Al Punto " program on Sunday , rejected the idea that he had abandoned the public ( or " government - run " ) option for which he'd expressed much previous support .
" I absolutely do not believe that it 's dead , " Obama told Univision .
" I think that it 's something that we can still include as part of a comprehensive reform effort . "
That defense may mark one of the most significant reactions Obama has had to date to the health bill unveiled by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus ( D - Mont . ) this week , which eschews the public option in favor of nonprofit healthcare cooperatives .
Baucus drafted that bill as a potential piece of compromise legislation to win over centrist Democrats and some Republicans who have expressed skepticism about establishing the public option .
For his part , Obama emphasized that he is not counting on Republicans to pass health reform , a signal that he may end up leaning on fellow Democrats only in order to achieve health reform this year .
" You know , I 'd love to get Republican votes , but I do n't count on them , " Obama said .
" And I 'm confident that we 're gonna get healthcare passed . "
The president reiterated a sense that Republicans had made a conscious decision to avoid supporting any health bill for their own political benefit .
" I think , that the opposition has made a decision , " he said .
" They are just not going to support anything , for political reasons . "
" Al Punto " was one of five stops the president made in his tour of the Sunday morning talk circuit this morning in order to make his case for health reform and other administration priorities .
The Spanish - language public policy show was launched in 2007 on Univision , a network on which every American president and a number of political leaders have appeared since it was launched in 1981 .
( CNN ) -- Nobel laureate Norman E. Borlaug , an agricultural scientist who helped develop disease - resistant wheat used to fight famine in poor countries , died Saturday .
He was 95 .
Norman Borlaug received a Congressional Gold Medal from then President George W. Bush on July 17 , 2007 .
Borlaug died from cancer complications in Dallas , Texas , a spokeswoman for Texas A&M University said .
A 1970 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize , Borlaug was a distinguished professor of international agriculture at the university .
Borlaug started at Texas A&M in 1984 , after working as a scientist in a program that introduced scientific techniques for preventing famine in Mexico , according to the university .
Until recently , he traveled worldwide working for improvements in agricultural science and food policy , said Kathleen Phillips , a university spokeswoman .
Borlaug was known as a champion of high - yield crop varieties , and other science and agricultural innovations to help fight hunger in developing nations .
iReport.com : Tour Borlaug 's boyhood farm
" We all eat at least three times a day in privileged nations , and yet we take food for granted , " Borlaug said recently in an interview posted on the university 's Web site .
" There has been great progress , and food is more equitably distributed .
But hunger is a commonplace , and famine appears all too often . "
He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977 , and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2006 , according to the university 's Web site .
The agriculture institute at the university was named after him in 2006 .
Borlaug also created the World Food Prize , which recognized the work of scientists and humanitarians who have helped fight world hunger through advanced agriculture , the university said .
A memorial service will be held at the university at a later date .
Nokia has announced the N900 Internet Tablet running the Linux - based Maemo operating system .
This is the latest in a series of Tablets ( not to be confused with Microsoft ’s Tablet PCs ) , but the first one to include “ cellular features ” , which means it can make and receive phone calls , though the press release hardly mentions it .
This is a big deal since this is now in effect a SmartPhone ( as the Reg observes ) and therefore may be offered with operator subsidies , which seems essential for grabbing market share in the crazy mobile phone business .
Nokia needs a success with this one , as its previous Tablets have made little impact beyond an enthusiast niche .
The full specification shows support for quad - band GSM EDGE as well as tri-band WCDMA .
There ’s also integrated GPS ; wi-fi ; 5 megapixel camera ; Mozilla web browser ( not WebKit ) ; Adobe Flash 9.4 ; Mail for Exchange ; 1GB of RAM split between application memory and virtual memory , and 32 GB internal storage .
Oh , and there ’s a slide - out QWERTY keyboard so this could be a great device for messaging .
This comes just after Nokia ’s Windows netbook announcement , the Booklet 3G , while the company is also running the Symbian Foundation and supposedly driving Symbian as an open - source mobile OS to rival Google ’s Android .
The big question : how many operating systems does Nokia need ?
I can understand its desire to get on the Windows 7 bandwagon with the Booklet 3G , but why continue with both Maemo and Symbian ?
Still , the N900 looks like a neat device ; see here for full information and images .
This excerpt from Modern Perl : the book discusses another feature of Perl 5 which makes parsing Perl 5 difficult .
Avoiding this feature in your own code will make it more reliable and easier to debug .
Read a few Perl 5 object tutorials ( or the documentation of too many CPAN modules ) , and you might believe that new is a language keyword just as in C++ and Java :
my $q = new CGI ; # DO NOT USE
As objects has made clear , a constructor in Perl 5 is anything which returns an object .
By convention , constructors are class methods named new ( ) , but you have the flexibility to choose a different approach to meet your needs .
If new ( ) is instead a class method , the standard method call approach should apply :
my $q = CGI -> new ( ) ;
These syntaxes are equivalent in behavior , except when they 're not .
The first form is the indirect object form ( more precisely , the dative case ) , where the verb ( the method ) precedes the noun to which it refers ( the object ) .
This is fine in spoken languages , but it introduces difficult to debug ambiguities in Perl 5 .
Bareword indirect invocations
One problem is that the name of the method is a bareword , requiring the Perl 5 parser to perform several heuristics to determine the proper interpretation .
While these heuristics are well - tested and almost always correct , their failure modes can be very confusing and difficult to debug .
Worse , they 're fragile in the face of the order of compilation and module loading .
Parsing is more difficult for humans and the computer when the constructor takes arguments .
The Java - style approach may resemble :
# DO NOT USE my $ obj = new Class ( arg => $ value ) ;
... thus making the classname Class look like a subroutine call .
Perl 5 can disambiguate many of these cases , but its heuristics depend on which package names the parser has seen so far , which barewords it has already resolved ( and how it resolved them ) , and the names of subroutines already declared in the current package .
Imagine running afoul of a subroutine with prototypes with a name which just happens to conflict somehow with the name of a class or a method called indirectly .
This happens infrequently , but it 's difficult enough to debug that it 's worth making impossible by avoiding this syntax .
Indirect notation scalar limitations
Another danger of the syntax is that the parser expects a single scalar expression as the object .
You may have had trouble printing to a filehandle stored in an aggregate variable :
# DOES NOT WORK AS WRITTEN say $ config ->{output} " This is a diagnostic message ! " ;
print , close , and say -- all keywords which operate on filehandles -- operate in an indirect fashion .
This was fine when filehandles were package globals , but with lexical_filehandles the problem can be more apparent , when Perl 5 tries to call the say method on the $ config object .
The solution is to disambiguate the expression which produces the intended invocant :
say {$config->{output}}
" This is a diagnostic message ! " ;
Alternatives to indirect notation
Direct invocation notation does not suffer this ambiguity problem .
To construct an object , call the constructor method on the class name directly :
my $ q = CGI -> new ( ) ; my $ obj = Class -> new ( arg => $ value ) ;
For filehandle operations , which are limited , known to the Perl 5 parser directly , and pervasive in their idiomatic use of the dative case , use curly brackets to remove ambiguity about your intended invocant .
Alternately , consider loading the core IO :: Handle module which allows you to perform IO operations by calling methods on filehandle objects ( such as lexical filehandles ) .
To identify indirect calls in your code , use the CPAN module Perl : : Critic : : Policy : : Dynamic :: NoIndirect ( a plugin for Perl : : Critic ) .
To forbid their use at compile time , use the CPAN module indirect .
Hello , I just wanted to provide everyone with a head ’s up that the next PLAYSTATION 3 system software update ( v.2.76 ) will be coming soon .
This is a minor update that improves the playback quality of some PS3 format software .
The original goal of the Twisted project , as I have been frequently reminded of late , is to create a general , inter - operable mainloop that is n't specific to any particular protocol .
The main loop was n't a goal in itself , as the point of making it general was to provide an opportunity for all protocols could have serious , production - quality implementations that any Twisted application could have access to .
Twisted itself ships with many different protocol implemenations in furtherance of this goal , in an attempt to get critical mass .
This generality is a great strength .
It means that we 've attracted a small crowd of generalists .
We have an excellent development process , ever - increasing quality of both code and documentation , and a wide variety of different protocol implementations and libraries for doing common networking and inter-process communication tasks .
We have recently been lucky to attract a few excellent developers to help with this .
The one thing we have n't been so lucky about is attracting specifists .
Although we still need more people to make Twisted awesome as a library , our community is getting better and better at doing that .
What we need even more than that is individuals with a very specific , focused interest on just one thing that Twisted does .
Czars , if you will , to push the development of Twisted as a suite of interoperating Twisted already has within it the seeds of excellent replacements for Apache httpd , OpenSSH , BIND , hybrid ircd , Sendmail , imapd , pop3d , and a few other servers , not to mention clients like Pidgin and the OpenSSH command - line client .
In order to sprout and take root , those seeds each need a dedicated advocate , someone who cares deeply about the experience of a user or administrator who just wants Twisted to perform one particular function and does n't want to write their own application code to make it do that .
Projects like the ones above - OpenSSH and BIND , for example - have an advantage in becoming useful : they have dedicated people who care deeply about satisfying a particular use - case , and are singularly focused on that case .
Since they only have the one problem to worry about , they can give it a much more direct treatment .
However , given the team of infrastructure programmers already working on Twisted , such a focused individual would have an incredible force multiplier .
Consider the statistics on Conch from our 2003 USENIX paper on Twisted : going just by line count , Conch was 4 x easier to write than even J2SSH , which was itself substantially smaller than OpenSSH .
It was 10 x easier to write than OpenSSH .
So , with the support of Twisted as infrastructure , one Twisted application programmer can do the work of ten merely mortal ones ;-) .
It might seem to those of you looking to write a chat client , DNS server , or whatever open - source giant that you want to do battle with , that Twisted is just a library , and you want to write an application .
But we reallytwisted to be a comprehensive suite of applications , we 're just stretched too thin already to make it realize that potential .
So please rest assured that we would love to have your help with turning Twisted itself into a worthy competitor for these open - source giants - or , for that matter , if you want to build your own competitor as a layer on top of Twisted ( for whatever reason : you love .ini files and we do n't , you want a more freewheeling development process , or you want a different shade of green on your web pages ) we 'd still love to help you out and support that effort by fixing whatever issues you have with Twisted 's core or protocols .
There 's even a super - project on Launchpad for Twisted - but - not - part - of - Twisted projects .
I invite all you application developers out there to join that group and help us with world domination .
( If all that stuff about being ten times more effective as a programmer was n't enough for you , how about this ?
On the Twisted Matrix Labs map of the post - revolutionary world , I 'm pretty sure the Emancipated Territory of New Jersey is still missing an archduke and several viscounts .
I can't make any promises , but if you get in on the ground floor of this thing there 's still a chance you could be a ruling member of the Twisted over - government ! )
Copenhagen is already one of the most bicycle - friendly cities in the world , with 55 % of its citizens riding a bicycle daily .
Now the question is how to get commuters from outlying areas biking too .
The answer is the bicycle superhighway .
Advertisement
Local pro-bike blog Copenhagenize reports that the city is planning a series of super bicycle routes from the suburbs , for people who bike more than 10 K to get to work .
The idea is to create roads where people can ride their bicycles steadily at over 20 km per hour , without worrying that they 'll have to deal with too much car traffic or with passing other bikes on narrow roads .
Copenhagenize writes :
The routes will be developed on the existing bike lanes but they will have a number of improved features , according to the City 's vision : - Smooth , even surfaces free of leaves , ice and snow .
- As direct as possible with no detours .
- Homogenous visual expression , for example , with signage and the trademark blue bike lanes through larger intersections .
- ' Service stations ' with air and tools along the routes .
- Possibility to maintain a high speed and with sufficient width to overtake other cyclists .
- Safe and quick crossing priority for cyclists when they approach cross streets .
- Green Wave for cyclists through sections with frequent stop lights .
[ The Green Wave is in place on three main routes into Copenhagen already .
Cycle 20 km/h and you hit green lights all the way . ]

If the future of urban transport is the bicycle , and many city planners as well as energy experts argue that it is , then surely this kind of road represents the future of commuting .
A similar plan is underway in the Danish city of Aarhus too .
via Copenhagenize
Unless you 're dendrophobic - in which case it would possibly be the worst sight on Earth seeing as Ents luckily do n't exist - there 's something eerily romantic and comforting about streets and paths lined with trees , especially when their branches grow to the point where they arch over the road itself and meet in the middle to form a natural tunnel .
Of course there a thousands of these green passageways around the planet so this is obviously a small selection , but I thought I 'd share a few examples of one of nature 's many visual treats .

Update 10 : Hilton Wrote a Check to Hardin Bed and Breakfast That Bounced
Via : Missoulian :
In announcing the suspension of a state investigation into American Police Force on Tuesday , state Attorney General Steve Bullock said he was “ unaware of any Montanans who have been harmed financially by this company . ”
Meet Marcianna Smith .
She is the owner of the Kendrick House Inn at 206 N. Custer Ave. in Hardin , a bed - and - breakfast where Michael Hilton and several other people associated with American Police Force stayed in late September .
Smith said a check Hilton wrote to her for “ about $ 1,000 ” has bounced .
It came back with “ account frozen ” stamped on it , she said Tuesday .
In addition to staying at the B&B , Hilton invited a lot of people to breakfast and put the bill on his tab .

Update 9 : 10/10/2009 01:00 GMT : Company Run by Ex -Con Drops Montana Jail Plan

Company run by ex-con drops Montana jail plan
By MATTHEW BROWN ( AP )
BILLINGS , Mont . —
An obscure California company run by an ex-convict with a history of fraud has dropped its effort to take over a beleaguered Montana jail , days after state officials launched an investigation .
The project has been dogged by a series of damaging revelations about the company , American Police Force , ever since officials in the rural town of Hardin announced with great fanfare last month that they had secured a $ 2.6 million deal to fill the jail .
An Associated Press investigation of American Police Force , including the criminal background of its founder , cast serious doubts about the legitimacy of the company , and its jail management proposal quickly spiraled toward its death .
American Police Force had faced a Monday deadline from the Montana attorney general ’s office to reveal its financial backers .
A spokesman for Attorney General Steve Bullock said the demand for information was still pending .
Becky Shay , spokeswoman for the company , said Friday the deal with Hardin had “ gone sour ” after media revelations about the founder , Michael Hilton .
But she insisted the company ’s intentions had been honest .
“ Two Rivers deserves a considerably less - controversial partner , ” she said of Hardin ’s economic development agency , which owns the 464 - bed jail .
“ There was never any fraudulent intention . ”
The jail has been vacant since its completion two years ago .
After looking for prisoners from Vermont to Alaska , officials were so desperate to fill it with inmates that they floated the idea that it could hold terrorists from Guantanamo Bay .
A short time later , American Police Force contacted Hardin about taking over its jail .
The company made sensational claims on its
Web site about its role in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and how it could mobilize special operations forces anywhere in the world on 72 - hours notice .
Officials in Hardin were so impressed with the company ’s credentials that they rushed into a contract in September without thoroughly investigating Hilton ’s background .
The AP ’s inquiry found that Hilton has gone by at least 17 aliases and has a history of fraud and theft dating back to at least 1988 .
He spent three years in prison in California and has $ 1.1 million in outstanding civil judgments against him .
Hilton later acknowledged offering a job to the wife of the executive director of Two Rivers Authority .
That official , Greg Smith , resigned Monday .
His wife , Kerri Smith , is a finalist in Hardin ’s upcoming mayoral election .
They have not returned requests for comment .
The September contract for the $ 27 million jail was never ratified .
It was signed by Hilton , Smith and Al Peterson , a board member of the quasi-public authority and Hardin ’s school superintendent .
Peterson said Friday he does not regret the decision .
“ I ca n’t say it was a mistake , ” he said .
“ We make the best decision we can based on the information we have on hand .
I do n’t think we did anything we could n’t or would n’t do in the future . ”
Peterson acknowledged Hilton paid for several meals when city representatives — including Greg and Kerri Smith — traveled to California to negotiate the deal last month .
But in a letter released Friday , Peterson and authority president Gary Arneson stated no other compensation was received .
Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer upbraided Hardin officials for first striking a deal with what he called “ con men ” and then defending American Police Force after Hilton ’s history emerged .
“ They became part of the conspiracy .
They became apologists , ” he said of Peterson and others involved in the deal .
Schweitzer added that Hardin residents “ need some people to represent them that have some business skills , that are honest and have integrity . ”
It is unknown who invested money in American Police Force or how much Hilton personally put into the effort .
He previously described his investors as “ friends and family ” and companies with which he was associated .
He had said he planned to sink $ 17 million into a law enforcement and military training center next to the jail .
Hilton had also talked of his company taking over local law enforcement services in Hardin for $ 250,000 a year .
That idea never got very far , even though he brought three Mercedes SUVs marked with made - up “ Hardin Police Department ” logos to his first public appearance in town .
He said he would donate the vehicles to the city but never did .
Those involved in Hilton ’s past schemes had doubts all along .
They included Richard Earnhart , a California contractor who invested more than $ 100,000 in an assisted living center that was promoted by Hilton in the late 1990s but never built .
As part of that scheme , Earnhart said he and several others involved were also given a Mercedes by Hilton .
He said his vehicle was repossessed days after he got it .
A judge last week ordered Hilton to appear in California Superior Court in Los Angeles on Oct. 27 , over a $ 340,000 outstanding judgment he owes in Earnhart ’s case .
“ He had me under his spell , ” Earnhart said of Hilton in a recent interview .
“ That prison ( the Hardin jail ) — he should be in it . ”

BILLINGS – On Sunday morning , there were some visible changes to California - based security company American Police Force ’s website .
What previously read “ American Police Force ” now uses the company ’s formal name “ American Private Police Force . ”
Another notable change is the company ’s crest .
The previous crest was a near copy of the Serbian Coat of Arms .
On Friday , KULR - 8 news first reported the Serbian government was looking into possible legal action against APF for using the crest .
The group ’s leader , Capt .
Michael Hilton said the crest was a family emblem and he used it to honor his grandfather .
APF Spokeswoman Becky
Shay said she is not aware of any lawsuit from the consulate and Hilton made the change as , “ the quickest thing he could to diffuse tension ” with the old logo .
She would not elaborate on exactly what those tensions were .
Along with changes to the company ’s image come changes to the potential contract with Hardin ’s economic development group Two Rivers Authority .
Spokesman Al Peterson said board members will meet Monday afternoon to discuss the contract , which was recently looked over by an independent tax expert .
Peterson said some of the language has been changed to ensure the bond , held by U.S. Bank , remains tax exempt .
If TRA board members approve the contract , it will still need to be approved by APF and U.S. Bank .
Peterson added that the bond is a revenue bond ; meaning residents of Hardin will never be responsible for paying it back .
It can only be paid for by income from the Hardin Jail itself .
Monday ’s meeting will be open to the public , but it is up to the group ’s president to determine if there will be a public comment period .
The meeting will start at 3:00 p.m .
It is held at Hardin ’s City Hall .
Shay said if TRA approves the contract , APF will move quickly to sign off as well .

Mont. jail project begins to unravel ; lawyer quits

BILLINGS , Mont .
—A California company ’s bid to take over an empty jail in rural Montana appears to be unraveling , with an attorney involved in the project cutting ties Friday and a second company , once named as a subcontractor , denying any involvement .
Those moves followed revelations earlier in the week that Michael Hilton — the lead figure of the company , American Police Force — is a convicted felon with a history of fraud and failed business dealings in California .
“ We met with him and he asked us if we can support him , ” said Edward Angelino , chief executive of Allied Defense Systems , an Irvine , Calif . - based defense contractor .
“ We checked his background , we checked his company .
He ’s not an adequate person to do business with . ”
American Police Force reached a deal last month with officials in Hardin to operate the city ’s jail .
The facility has never held an inmate since its 2007 completion .
Hilton pledged to open the jail by early next year and bring more than 200 new jobs to the struggling community , located in southeastern Montana on the border of the Crow Indian Reservation .
Hilton also said he would build a $ 17 million military training center in the city .
Citing concerns over the legitimacy of American Police Force , the Montana attorney general ’s office on Thursday launched an investigation into the company .
That included a demand for documents supporting Hilton ’s claim that he ’s backed by a major security corporation

wishing to remain anonymous .
American Police Force spokeswoman Becky Shay insisted Friday that the jail takeover remained on track .
She said a job fair for prospective employees would still be held during the week of Oct. 12 .
Hilton returned to California earlier this week after spending several days in Hardin .
He intends to return for the job fair , Shay said .
City economic development officials and the company have agreed on the jail contract , but it has n’t been ratified by US Bank .
The bank has a stake as trustee for $ 27 million in construction bonds used to pay for the 464 - bed facility .
No money has changed hands between Hardin and American Police Force .
Hardin Mayor Ron Adams said Friday that despite his reservations about the project , he would still like to see it go forward so the jail can be filled .
Rumors continued to circulate in Hardin and on the Internet that American Police Force was backed by an unknown government agency with plans to use the jail as a detention or training center for foreign combatants .
Those rumors have been fueled by Hardin ’s earlier efforts to bring in terrorism detainees from Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer on Friday dismissed the notion of any secretive government scheme .
“ I think a low - level card shark is not going to rise to the level to get some kind of government defense contract , ” the governor said .
Hilton had claimed Allied Defense Systems would provide the uniforms for guards at the jail .
On Sept. 30 , an attorney for the Irvine company sent a letter to Hilton threatening a lawsuit over the use of the company ’s name .
Meanwhile , Maziar Mafi , a lawyer from Santa Ana , Calif. , who served as the legal affairs director for American Police Force , said he wanted to see the project begin to move forward before he could continue his involvement .
“ For the time , I ’m pulling out , ” Mafi said .
“ I need to see more concrete action before I can be involved . ”
Shay said she was unaware of the move by Allied Defense Systems and had not spoken with Mafi directly .
Mafi ’s involvement began last month — about the same time Hilton reached a contract agreement with Greg Smith of Hardin ’s Two Rivers Authority , which owns the jail .
Smith has since been placed on paid leave from the quasi-public agency .
And now , with Mafi ’s departure , a jail critic said the project appeared doomed to failure .
“ He sees the ship is going down , ” said Alex Friedmann with the Private Corrections Institute , a group that has long been critical of Hardin for building a jail that would be privately run .
Hilton , who claims an extensive military background and uses the title “ captain , ” initially described Mafi as a “ major ” in American Police Force .
He later said Mafi was the company ’s president — although Mafi denied the role and said he had no military or security background .
Mafi guaranteed the Sept. 10 purchase of two Mercedes SUVs by Hilton as part of his plans for the jail .
They were among three Mercedes that Hilton brought to Montana last week , saying he intended to turn over to Hardin for use by law enforcement .
A financing payment on at least one of the vehicles is now overdue .
Only one Mercedes remains in Montana .
It ’s being driven by company spokeswoman Shay , who said Friday that she intends to register it soon .
Shay quit her job with the Billings Gazette to work for Hilton .
She said Friday that she remained comfortable with that decision , and that Hilton told her before she was hired about his criminal record and several civil judgments against him totaling more than $ 1.1 million .
Those judgments remain outstanding .
“ A lot of people that know me , know about me have asked me if I ’ve been duped , ” Shay said .
“ No . ”

Update 5 : 10/2/2009 01:35GMT : Montana AG Launches Probe of Jail Deal
Via : AP :
By MATTHEW BROWN ( AP )
BILLINGS , Mont. — Montana ’s attorney general launched an investigation Thursday into a California company that wants to take over an empty jail in the rural city of Hardin , following revelations that the company ’s lead figure is a convicted felon with a history of fraud .
Michael Hilton , who formed Santa Ana , Calif . - based American Police Force in March , came to Hardin last month promising to fill the city ’s never - used jail and build a large military and law enforcement training center .
Hilton has a decades - long track record of fraudulent activities and spent several years in a California prison on grand theft charges .
A native of Montenegro , he uses at least 17 aliases .
Citing “ significant concerns ” about the city ’s dealings with American Police Force , Attorney General Steve Bullock asked Hardin economic development officials to produce by Oct. 12 all documents related to their dealings with the company .
His office made a similar demand of American Police Force , including information that would back up Hilton ’s claims of multiple defense contracts with the U.S government and other agencies .
The launch of the investigation came as some Hardin officials began backing away from American Police Force .
The city ’s Two Rivers Authority reached a 10 - year deal on the jail with the company last month .
But that was never ratified by US Bank , the trustee on the construction bonds used to pay for the 464 - bed facility .
Attorney Becky Convery , who helped negotiate the deal , said Hilton overstepped his bounds when he showed up in Hardin last week with three Mercedes SUVs marked with fictitious “ Hardin Police Department ” logos .
He pledged to donate the SUVs to the city and also offered to provide law enforcement for Hardin for $ 250,000 a year .
That prospect has stirred suspicion among critics that rural Hardin , population 3,500 , could be transformed into a privately run police state .
Convery said Two Rivers director Greg Smith had a tentative deal with Hilton ’s company to provide law enforcement service , but she said it was never finalized and she was uncertain whether it would be legal .
“ We are not at all pleased with American Police masquerading as if they were the police for the city of Hardin , ” she said .
Yet other Hardin officials remained loyal to American Police Force despite knowing little of its origins beyond what they ’ve been told by Hilton .
“ I do n’t know that his background has affected his position or his ability to do his work , ” said Carla Colstad , a member of the Hardin City Council .
“ I do n’t consider it relevant to what ’s going on today . ”
Hilton — who came to Hardin last week in a black , military - style uniform — portrayed his company as an international player in the security industry .
No records have been found of the extensive U.S. government contracts he claims .
Instead , documents and interviews with Hilton ’s associates revealed a history of fraud and criminal activity .
That includes outstanding judgments against him in three civil cases totaling more than $ 1.1 million .
“ Such schemes you cannot believe , ” said Joseph Carella , an Orange County , Calif. , doctor and co-defendant with Hilton in a real estate fraud case that resulted in a civil judgment against Hilton and several others .
Carella , described in court documents as a “ pawn ” in the scheme , said he was never a willing participant .
But he acknowledged partnering with Hilton in other failed business deals after being won over by his charm .
“ The guy ’s brilliant .
If he had been able to do honest work , he probably would have been a gazillionaire , ” Carella said .
As for Hilton ’s military expertise , including his claim to have advised forces in Iraq and Afghanistan , several associates interviewed knew of no such feats , although one said Hilton had talked of being in the special forces in Greece decades ago .
Most who knew him described Hilton alternately as an art dealer , cook , restaurant owner , land developer , loan broker and car salesman .
Hilton did not return numerous calls seeking comment this week .
American Police Force attorney Maziar Mafi referred questions to company spokeswoman Becky Shay .
When asked about court records detailing Hilton ’s past , Shay replied : “ The documents speak for themselves .
If anyone has found public documents , the documents are what they are . ”
The three SUVs Hilton brought to Montana have yet to be turned over to the city , which does not have a police force of its own but is considering forming one .
At least one is being driven by Shay , a former reporter who abruptly quit her job at the Billings Gazette to work for American Police Force .
She said Hilton offered her $ 60,000 a year .
The jail deal is worth more than $ 2.6 million a year , according to city leaders .
His criminal record goes back to at least 1988 , when Hilton was arrested in Santa Ana , Calif . , for writing bad checks .
In 1993 , Hilton was sentenced to six years in prison in California on a dozen counts of grand theft and attempted grand theft and other charges including illegal diversion of construction funds .

Update 3 : 10/1/2009 10:50 GMT : APF Head Hilton Has Criminal Past
Via : Billings Gazette :
RUFFIN PREVOST Gazette Wyoming Bureau | Posted : Wednesday , September 30 , 2009 6:25 pm
CODY , Wyo . – Michael Hilton of American Police Force arrived in Hardin with promises of Mercedes police cars and expertise in operating prisons .
He delivered the cars last week , but may have learned about prisons following a 1993 conviction for grand theft .
Public records from police and state and federal courts in California show that Michael Anthony Hilton , using that name and more than a dozen aliases over several years , is cited in multiple criminal , civil and bankruptcy cases , and was sentenced in 1993 to two years in state prison in California .
Hilton pleaded guilty in March 1993 to 14 felonies , including 10 counts of grand theft , one count of attempted grand theft and three counts of diversion of construction funds , according to Orange County court records .
He was sentenced to two years in prison , but it is unclear how much time he served .
Court records in that case list his real name as Michael Hilton , but they also include the aliases Midrag Ilia Dokovitch , Midrag Ilia Dokovich and Michael Miodrag .
Hilton , who speaks heavily accented English , has told reporters that he is a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Montenegro , a country bordering Serbia , and once part of the former Republic of Yugoslavia .
The same aliases and other similar ones , all with slightly different spellings , show up in many other court documents citing Hilton , including a May 2003 Orange County case in which Hilton pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol .
A booking photo from the Huntington Beach Police Department from Hilton ’s DUI arrest on March 14 , 2003 , shows him heavier , beardless and with more hair than he has now .
It also shows the same facial features , including a distinct arched wrinkle over his left eye , along with three deep brow furrows , small , circular indentations in the center of his forehead and a cleft tip on the nose .
Michael Hilton and his aliases are listed as defendants in various Orange County civil cases alleging fraud and breach of warranty , including a March 2000 case where he is accused of fraud , larceny , breach of contract and false pretenses .
Court documents in that case allege that Hilton and others solicited investments of hundreds of thousands of dollars from the plaintiff for the creation of collectible Super Bowl commemorative coins .
The complaint alleges that Hilton and others falsely told the plaintiff that the money would be used for the design and manufacture of the coins , and to pay for a National Football League license to produce them .
In fact , the complaint states , no such license was ever issued by the NFL .
Court documents show that the plaintiff obtained a 2001 judgment for $ 200,000 against Hilton , listing his aliases of Miodrag Dokovich and Midrag Ilia Dokovich .
Hilton also declared Chapter 13 bankruptcy twice during a 15 - month period .
He filed under his real name , citing the alias Miodrag A. Dokovich , in November 2002 , listing a Stanton , Calif. , home address and a Fountain Valley , Calif. , business address tied to the Belgrade Market Liquor and Deli .
In February 2004 , Hilton filed under his real name , citing the alias Miodrag Dokovich , and listing a Santa Ana , Calif . , home address .
He estimated his assets at less than $ 50,000 , and listed as creditors only a credit union and his landlord .
Both bankruptcy filings appear to have been intended to delay eviction proceedings against him .
Under federal bankruptcy law , tenants are generally protected from eviction while they reorganize their finances .
Anh Q.D. Nguyen , a Garden Grove attorney , said in an e-mail that he represented Hilton ’s landlord in an eviction case against Hilton that was filed in January 2004 .
Nguyen said that Hilton “ filed an eleventh - hour bankruptcy petition in which my office successfully obtained relief from the bankruptcy automatic stay , in order to reclaim possession of the rented premises . ”
Hilton had also been named as a defendant in July 2002 as part of separate eviction proceedings before his bankruptcy filing that year .
Hilton filed both bankruptcies without an attorney , paying less than $ 275 in filing fees for each .
Both petitions were dismissed by the court after Hilton failed to provide necessary documentation , including a financial reorganization plan .
Chapter 13 bankruptcies generally remain on personal credit histories for seven years , and show up on standard credit checks .
When asked on Wednesday about Hilton ’s business dealings before his involvement with APF , company spokeswoman Becky Shay said , “ That information is not going to be made available at this point . ”
“ That ’s his private business .
He is a man who distinguishes between private and business , between personal and corporate , ” she said .
Shay said she would check with Hilton for a comment about his DUI arrest , but did not provide further details .
She did not respond to an additional call made later Wednesday seeking more information about Hilton ’s other past legal problems .

Calif . jail entrepreneur has checkered past
By MATTHEW BROWN ( AP )
BILLINGS , Mont. — Michael Hilton pitched himself to officials in Hardin , Mont . as a military veteran turned private sector entrepreneur , a California defense contractor with extensive government contracts who promised to turn the rural city ’s empty jail into a cash cow .
Hardin ’s leaders were desperate to fill the $ 27 million jail , which has sat empty since its 2007 completion .
So when Hilton came to town last week — wearing a military - style uniform and offering three Mercedes SUVs for use by local law enforcement — he was greeted with hugs by some grateful residents .
The promise of more than 200 new jobs for a community struggling long before the recession hit had won them over .
But public documents and interviews with Hilton ’s associates and legal adversaries offer a different picture , that of a convicted felon with a number of aliases , a string of legal judgments against him , two bankruptcies and a decades - long reputation for deals gone bad .
American Police Force is the company Hilton formed in March to take over the Hardin jail .
“ Such schemes you cannot believe , ” said Joseph Carella , an Orange County , Calif .
doctor and co-defendant with Hilton in a real estate fraud case that resulted in a civil judgment against Hilton and several others .
“ The guy ’s brilliant .
If he had been able to do honest work , he probably would have been a gazillionaire , ” Carella said .
Court documents show Hilton has outstanding judgments against him in three civil cases totaling more than $ 1.1 million .
As for Hilton ’s military expertise , including his claim to have advised forces in Iraq and Afghanistan , those interviewed knew of no such feats .
Instead , Hilton was described alternately by those who know him as an arts dealer , cook , restaurant owner , land developer , loan broker and car salesman — always with a moneymaking scheme in the works .
Hilton did not return several calls seeking comment .
American Police Force attorney Maziar Mafi referred questions to company spokeswoman Becky Shay .
When asked about court records detailing Hilton ’s past , Shay replied , “ The documents speak for themselves .
If anyone has found public documents , the documents are what they are . ”
Shay declined comment on Hilton ’s military experience .
Al Peterson , vice president of Hardin ’s Two Rivers Authority , which built the jail , declined to comment on Hilton ’s legal troubles .
He refused to say if he knew about Hilton ’s past when the authority reached a 10 - year agreement with American Police Force last month .
The deal is worth more than $ 2.6 million a year , according to city leaders .
Hilton has also pledged to build a $ 17 million military and law enforcement training center .
And he ’s promised to dispatch security to patrol Hardin ’s streets , build an animal shelter and a homeless shelter and offer free health care to city resident ’s out of the jail ’s clinic .
Those additional promises were not included in the jail agreement , which remains in limbo because US Bank has so far declined to sign off on the contract .
The bank is the trustee for the bonds used to fund the jail .
A US Bank spokeswoman declined to comment , but Peterson was adamant the deal would be approved .
“ It ’s a solid deal .
That ’s all I ’ll say , ” he said .
But a representative of a corrections advocacy group that has been critical of Hardin ’s jail and has investigated Hilton ’s past said city leaders dropped the ball .
“ I ’m amazed that city officials did n’t do basic research that would have raised significant questions about American Private Police Force and Mr. Hilton ’s background , ” said Alex Friedmann , vice president of the Private Corrections Institute .
Hilton , 55 , uses the title “ captain ” when introducing himself and on his business cards .
But he acknowledged it was not a military rank .
He said he is naturalized U.S. citizen and native of Montenegro .
Aliases for Hilton that appear in court documents include Miodrag Dokovich , Michael Hamilton , Hristian Djokich and Michael Djokovich .
One attorney who dealt with Hilton in a fraud lawsuit referred to him as a “ chameleon ” and he has a reputation for winning people over with his charm .
His criminal record goes back to at least 1988 , when Hilton was arrested in Santa Ana , Calif . for writing bad checks .
Beginning in 1993 , Hilton spent six years in prison in California on a dozen counts of grand theft and other charges including illegal diversion of construction funds .
The charges included stealing $ 20,000 in a real estate swindle in which Hilton convinced an associate to give him a deed on property in Long Beach , Calif. , ostensibly as collateral on a loan .
Hilton turned around and sold the property to another party but was caught when the buyer contacted the original owner .
After his release , he got entangled in at least three civil lawsuits alleging fraud or misrepresentation .
Those included luring investors to sink money into gold and silver collectible coins ; posing as a fine arts dealer in Utah in order to convince a co uple to give him a $ 100,000 silver statue ; and , in the case involving co-defendant Carella , seeking investors for an assisted living complex in Southern California that was never built .
Carella said he was duped into becoming a partner in the development project and that Hilton used Carella ’s status as a physician to lure others into the scheme .
He was described in court testimony as a “ pawn ” used by Hilton to lure investors .
Those involved with Hilton say he is an accomplished cook with a flair for the extravagant — wining and dining potential partners , showing up at the Utah couple ’s house to negotiate for the silver statue in a chauffeur - driven Mercedes .
“ This is the way we got taken , ” said Carolyn Call of Provo , Utah , who said she gave Hilton her family ’s silver statue to sell on the open market .
According to court documents , Hilton turned around and gave the statue to an attorney to pay for his services .
Two California attorneys said Wednesday that after learning of Hilton ’s latest activities they planned to follow him to Montana to seek payment on the outstanding judgments against him .
“ Once I know that there is an asset or some sort of funds to go after , we ’ll go after it , ” said Call ’s attorney , Roger Naghash .

Is Michael Hilton this guy ’s real name ?

By MATTHEW BROWN Associated Press – Posted : Sunday , September 27 , 2009 6:45 am
HARDIN – After arriving in this rural city with three Mercedes SUVs marked with the logo of a nonexistent police department , representatives of an obscure California security company said preparations were under way to take over Hardin ’s never - used , $ 27 million jail .
Significant obstacles remain – including a lack of any prisoner contracts on the part of the company that wants to run the jail , American Police Force .
And on Friday came the revelation the company ’s operating agreement for the facility has yet to be validated – two weeks after city leaders first unveiled what they said was a signed agreement .
Still , some Hardin leaders said the deal to turn over the 464 - bed jail remained on track .
The agreement with American Police Force has been heavily promoted by members of the city ’s economic development branch , the Two Rivers Authority .
Authority vice president Albert Peterson on Friday repeated his claim to be “ 100 percent ” confident in the company .
The lead public figure for American Police Force , Michael Hilton , said more than 200 employees would be sought for the jail and a proposed military and law enforcement training center .
That would be a significant boost to Hardin , a struggling town of 3,500 located about 45 miles east of Billings .
An earlier announcement that a job fair would be held during the last week never came to fruition .
The bonds used to pay for the jail have been in default since May 2008 .
Hilton also said he planned a helicopter tour of the region in coming days to look at real estate for a planned tactical military training ground .
He said 5,000 to 10,000 acres were needed to complement the training center , a $ 17 million project .
But the company ’s flashy arrival stirred new questions .
The logo on the black Mercedes SUVs said “ City of Hardin Police Department . ”
Yet the city has not had a police force of its own for 30 years .
“ Pretty looking police car , ai n’t it ? ” Hardin resident Leroy Frickle , 67 , said as he eyed one of the vehicles parked in front of a bed and breakfast where Hilton and other company representatives were staying .
“ The things you hear about this American Police , I do n’t know what to think . ”
Hilton said the vehicles would be handed over to the city if it forms a police force of its own .
The city is now under the jurisdiction of the Big Horn County Sheriff ’s Office .
After meeting briefly with Hilton on Friday , Mayor Ron Adams said he wanted the police logos removed .
“ This helps , but it does n’t answer everything until the contract is signed , ” Adams said .
“ Talk is cheap . ”
Hilton said the company ’s arrival in Hardin would help allay such concerns .
And he promised that on Feb.
1 , 2010 , Hardin would receive its first check under a deal said to be worth more than $ 2.6 million annually .
Little has been revealed to date about American Police Force .
The company was incorporated in California in March , soon after Hardin ’s empty jail gained notoriety after city leaders suggested it could be used for the Guantanamo Bay terrorism detainees .
Members of Montana ’s congressional delegation say they have been closely monitoring the events in Hardin , but the city has largely been going it alone .
In the two years since the jail was built , city leaders have clashed repeatedly with the administration of Gov. Brian Schweitzer , who opposed efforts to bring in out - of - state prisoners .
After then - Attorney General Mike McGrath issued a 2007 opinion saying prisoners from other states were prohibited , Hardin successfully sued the state .
Despite the city ’s contention that the state has continued to foil its efforts to find prisoners , Montana Department of Corrections spokesman Bob Anez said his agency is no longer involved .
“ That ’s water under the bridge , ” Anez said .
On Friday , American Police Force announced its first local hire : a reporter for the Billings Gazette , Becky Shay , who has covered events surrounding the jail since its construction .
She will be the company ’s spokeswoman for $ 60,000 a year .
Shay said she intended to bring new transparency to the process , but declined to directly answer the first question posed to her :
Where is American Police Force getting the money to operate the jail and build the training center ?
“ I know enough about where the money is coming from to be confident signing on with them , ” she said .
Gazette editor Steve Prosinski said he was first informed about Shay ’s decision to leave the paper on Friday .
“ We were n’t aware that she was talking with them about employment , ” he said .
Hilton said he also had a job discussion with Kerri Smith , wife of Two Rivers Authority executive director Greg Smith , who helped craft the deal to bring American Police Force to Hardin .
Greg Smith was placed on unpaid leave two weeks ago for reasons that have not been explained .
Kerri Smith is one of two finalists in the city ’s mayoral race .
Hilton said he asked her to call him about possible employment if she did not win the race .
Smith could not be reached immediately for comment .
A message was left by the Associated Press at a theater owned by the Smith family .
Her home number is unlisted .

The Two Rivers Detention Center was promoted as the largest economic development project in decades in the small town of Hardin when the jail was built two years ago .
But it has been vacant ever since .
City officials have searched from Vermont to Alaska for inmate contracts to fill the jail , only to be turned down at every turn and see the bonds that financed its construction fall into default .
They even floated the idea of housing prisoners from Guantanamo Bay at the jail .
So when Hardin officials announced this week that they had signed a deal with a California company to fill the empty jail , it was naturally a cause for celebration .
Town officials talked about throwing a party to mark the occasion , their dreams of economic salvation a step closer to being realized .
But questions are emerging over the legitimacy of the company , American Police Force .
Government contract databases show no record of the company .
Security industry representatives and federal officials said they had never heard of it .
On its Web site , the company lists as its headquarters a building in Washington near the White House that holds “ virtual offices . ”
A spokeswoman for the building said American Police Force never completed its application to use the address .
And it ’s unclear where the company will get the inmates for the jail .
Montana says it ’s not sending inmates to the jail , and neither are federal officials in the state .
An attorney for American Police Force , Maziar Mafi , describes the Santa Ana , Calif. , company as a fledgling spin - off of a major security firm founded in 1984 .
But Mafi declined to name the parent firm or provide details on how the company will finance its jail operations .
“ It will gradually be more clear as things go along , ” said Mafi , a personal injury and medical malpractice lawyer in Santa Ana who was only hired by American Police Force a month ago .
“ The nature of this entity is private security and for security purposes , as well as for the interest of their clientele , that ’s why they prefer not to be upfront . ”
On its elaborate Web site and in interviews with company representatives , American Police Force claims to sell assault rifles and other weapons in Afghanistan on behalf of the U.S. military while providing security , investigative work and other services to clients “ in all 50 states and most countries . ”
The company also boasts to have “ rapid response units awaiting our orders worldwide ” and that it can field a battalion - sized team of special forces soldiers “ within 72 hours . ”
Representatives of American Police Force said the company presently employs at least 16 and as many as 28 people in the United States and 1,600 contractors worldwide .
“ APF plays a critical role in helping the U.S. government meet vital homeland security and national defense needs , ” the company says on its Web site .
“ Within the last 5 years the United States has been far and away our ” number 1 client .
However , an Associated Press search of two comprehensive federal government contractor databases turned up no record of American Police Force .
Representatives of security trade groups said they had never heard of American Police Force , although they added secrecy was prevalent in the industry and it was possible the company had avoided the public limelight .
“ They ’re really invisible , ” said Alan Chvotkin , executive vice president and counsel for the Professional Services Council .
The group ’s members include major security contractors Triple Canopy , DynCorp and Xe Services , formerly known as Blackwater Worldwide .
“ Even a single unclassified contract in the last couple of years should show up ” in the federal database , Chvotkin added .
Spokesmen for the State Department and Defense Department said they could not immediately find any records of contracts with the company .
The city has not released a copy of its agreement with American Police Force .
But the deal as announced would be a sweet one for Hardin , a depressed rural town of 3,500 about 45 miles east of Billings .
The company is pledging to fill the 464 - bed facility by early next year .
Hardin officials say the first payment on the contract is due Feb. 1 — regardless of whether any prisoners are in place .
The city ’s economic development authority would get enough money to pay off the bondholders and receive $ 5 per prison a day .
American Police
Force also is promising to invest $ 30 million in new projects for the city , including a military and law enforcement training center with a 250 - bed dormitory and an expansion of the jail to 2,000 beds .
The company says it will build a homeless shelter , offer free health care for city residents and even deliver meals to the needy .
Where the prisoners would come from is unclear .
City officials said California was the most likely possibility , but a spokesman for that state ’s corrections system said there was no truth to the claim .
Federal prisoners also were mentioned by both American Police Force and the city .
U.S. Marshal Dwight MacKay in Billings said he would have been notified if such a plan was pending .
“ There ’s skepticism over whether this is a real thing , ” MacKay said .
Hardin officials said they were approached by American Police Force about six months ago , soon after the city made international news in its quest to become “ America ’s Gitmo . ” American Police Force incorporated around the same time .
Albert Peterson , the city ’s school superintendent and vice president of the authority that built the jail , said the city was “ guaranteed ” the contract would be upheld .
“ There ’s never a question in my mind after I ’ve done my homework .
It ’s legit , ” Peterson said of American Police Force .
“ We believe in each other . ”
The contract was still being reviewed by the city attorney , he said .
Peterson refused to answer when asked if he knew the name of American Police Force ’s parent firm .
He said news coverage of the city ’s political tussles with the administration of Gov. Brian Schweitzer had left him suspicious of the press .
The administration brought a court challenge over whether Hardin could take out - of - state inmates at the jail .
“ If you ’re looking for the source of the money , you ’re not going to find it from me , ” Peterson said .
A member of the Texas consortium that developed the jail , Mike Harling , said he had “ every reason to believe they ’ll be successful . ”
Mafi , the American Police Force attorney , said his company intends to reverse Hardin ’s recent problems with the jail and give the town an economic boost .
In Santa Ana , American Police Force occupies a single suite on the second floor of a two - story office building .
During a visit to the location Thursday , a reporter for The Associated Press encountered a uniformed man behind a desk who would identify himself only as “ Captain Michael . ”
The man declined to discuss basic details about the company and referred the reporter to the company ’s Web site .
In a subsequent phone interview , he provided his surname but insisted it not be used because of security concerns .
The man said he was a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Montenegro with decades of experience in military and law enforcement operations .
The man said his boss is a retired U.S. Army colonel named Richard Culver who is currently overseas .
Culver ’s role with the company could not be immediately verified .
The company claim of a headquarters address is just up the street from the White House .
The K Street building houses “ virtual offices , ” where clients pay to use the prestigious Pennsylvania Avenue address and gain access to onsite conference rooms but have no permanent presence .
“ It lets small businesses get started up and have a professional front and not have a lot of a cash to do it , ” said Ashley Korner with Preferred Offices , which leases the location .
She said American Police Force ’s application to use the address was pending , but incomplete .
A new study uses advanced brain - scanning technology to cast light on a topic that psychologists have puzzled over for more than half a century : social conformity .
The study was based on a famous series of laboratory experiments from the 1950's by a social psychologist , Dr. Solomon Asch .
In those early studies , the subjects were shown two cards .
On the first was a vertical line .
On the second were three lines , one of them the same length as that on the first card .
Then the subjects were asked to say which two lines were alike , something that most 5 - year - olds could answer correctly .
