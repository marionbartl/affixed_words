Experts fear birds will carry the virus across borders
David Nabarro , who is charged with co-ordinating responses to bird flu , said a mutation of the virus affecting Asia could trigger new outbreaks .
" It 's like a combination of global warming and HIV / Aids 10 times faster than it 's running at the moment , " Dr Nabarro told the BBC .
But the World Health Organisation has distanced itself from the figure .
The WHO spokesman on influenza , Dick Thompson , told a news conference in Geneva that the WHO 's official estimate of the number of people who could die was between two million and 7.4 million .
QUICK GUIDE
Bird flu
" There is obvious confusion , and I think that has to be straightened out .
I do n't think you will hear Dr Nabarro say the same sort of thing again , " Mr Thompson said .
Bird flu has swept through poultry and wild birds in Asia since 2003 .
It has killed huge numbers of birds and led to more than 60 human deaths .
Prepared for worst
" The range of deaths could be anything between 5 m and 150 m , " the UN's new co-ordinator for avian and human influenza said in his BBC interview .
Dr Nabarro said he stood by the figure drawn from the work of epidemiologists around the world .
" My reason for giving the higher figure is simply that I want to be sure that when this next flu pandemic does come along , that we are prepared for the worst as well as for the mildest , " he said .
In an earlier interview with the BBC , he said the likelihood that the Asian virus could mutate and jump to humans was high .
" The consequences in terms of human life when the pandemic does start are going to be extraordinary and very damaging , " he said .
Because it has moved to wild migratory birds there is a possibility " that the first outbreak could happen even in Africa or in the Middle East " , he warned .
The comments came as agriculture ministers from the Association of South East Asian Nations ( Asean ) endorsed a three - year plan to combat the spread of the virus , and pledged $ 2 m to fund research and training .
H5N1 BIRD FLU VIRUS
Principally an avian disease , first seen in humans in Hong Kong , 1997 Almost all human cases thought to be contracted from birds Isolated cases of human - to - human transmission in Hong Kong and Vietnam , but none confirmed

" I believe that the work we 're doing over the next few months will make the difference between , for example , whether the next pandemic leads us in the direction of 150 or in the direction of five . "
The appointment of Dr Nabarro is an indication of how seriously the UN is taking the threat , the BBC's UN correspondent Suzannah Price says .
In his new role , he is meant to ensure the UN has a co-ordinated response to bird flu and that it helps global efforts to prepare for any human flu pandemic , our correspondent says .
America 's idea of what constituted torture " is not the same as ours and does n't appear to coincide with that of most civilised countries " , says judge
Three British residents detained at Guantánamo Bay were today given the go - ahead to seek a high court order requiring the foreign secretary , Jack Straw , to press the US for their release .
The three detainees involved in the case are not British citizens but were long - term residents in the UK before their detention at the US naval base in Cuba .
Mr Justice Collins , a high court judge in London , said that a factor in his ruling today was that there were allegations of torture at the detention facility .
The judge 's decision came after a day - long hearing during which he commented that America 's idea of what constituted torture " is not the same as ours and does n't appear to coincide with that of most civilised countries " .
Mr Justice Collins has a reputation for making controversial remarks and his pronouncements from the treatment of Gypsies to laws on terrorism and immigration have brought howls of disapproval from both Conservative and Labour politicians .
He said the men and their families living in the UK had an arguable case that the British government was under an obligation to act on their behalf .
However , the judge stressed his decision was " no guarantee " that the three men , Bisher al - Rawi , Jamil el - Banna and Omar Deghayes , and their families , would win their case .
There were formidable arguments against them , the judge said .
His remarks today coincided with a UN report which urged that the Guantánamo facility should be shut down and called on the US government to refrain from any practice " amounting to torture or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment " .
After the judge 's decision today , the full case against Mr Straw is expected to be heard in mid-March .
Nine British citizens who had been detained at Guantánamo Bay have all been flown back to the UK and released without charge .
The British government pushed Washington to secure the release of the Britons - and human rights groups have called for the same pressure to be exerted by the UK over long term UK residents .
Gareth Peirce , the solicitor for the three men , said after today 's hearing : " After so many years of such bitter disappointment , this is the first ray of light that we have had - the first ability to hope that this might be the beginning of the end for the ordeal of these three families . "
Earlier , Rabinder Singh QC , for the men and their families , had told the judge the case arose out of what had been described by a law lord as the " utter lawlessness at Guantánamo Bay " , where people were being detained indefinitely without trial .
Mr Rawi , 37 , an Iraqi national who had lived in Britain since 1985 , and his Jordanian business partner Mr Banna , who was granted refugee status in 2000 , were detained three years ago in Gambia - " far from any theatre of war " , said Mr Singh .
They were alleged to have been associated with al - Qaida through their connection with the radical Muslim cleric Abu Qatada .
Mr Singh said Mr Rawi's contact with Qatada was " expressly approved and encouraged by British intelligence " to whom he supplied information about the cleric .
The judge was told that intelligence operatives assured Mr Rawi that , should he run into trouble , they would intervene and assist him .
But the British government was subsequently unwilling to make material available to him when a hearing on his case was held at Guantánamo Bay , the QC said .
Mr Banna was said to have been in possession of " a homemade electronic device " at the time of his arrest .
It was , in fact , a battery charger bought from Argos and cleared by the UK authorities before he went to Gambia .
Mr Deghayes was detained in Pakistan .
His name was said to be on the FBI 's " most wanted " list .
But the photograph in his file was of a " totally different individual " , said Mr Singh .
Mr Justice Collins was told that Mr Deghayes had been rendered virtually blind in one eye by the use of pepper spray and the gouging of his eye during his detention , yet was still being constantly subjected to high light levels .
The government 's counsel , Philip Sales , said the foreign secretary had already decided to reconsider Mr Rawi 's case because of its particular circumstances .
His argument that permission should not be granted in the other cases because the detainees did not have British nationality was rejected by Mr Justice Collins .

Why is everyone is rushing to create the best walled garden for other peoples stuff ?
From their random musings , to their pictures and videos , it seems that everyone has bought into the idea that if you collect enough UGC ( Unlikely to Generate Cash ) a business will magically appear .
The alchemist running UGC sites would have us believe that they can harness the magical powers of the Long Tail and transform UGC lead into advertising gold .
While I ’m no expert in the properties of power law distributions , nothing I ’ve read about the Long Tail would indicate that a million audiences of one is the same as one audience of million .
Chief among these new age shamans is YouTube , the uber popular video sharing site where you can observe everything from on air flatulence by geriatric broadcasters to the incoherent gamblings of teenage girls in tight clothing ( the pyromaniacal antics of their male counterparts are also available if thats your preference ) .
As the reigning leader of UGC ( Unwatchable Generic Crud ) video aggregation , and the only one with stats available online , YouTube , provided an easy source of raw data , around which to do a bit of musing .
The fact that I want a signed copy of Chris Anderson ’s new book , which will be out in the US in 10 days , has absolutely nothing to do with the timing of this post .
My meticulous collection of data ( copy and paste job ) , biting analysis ( conjecture buried in verbosity ) and witty prose is my small ( very small ) contribution to the knowledge in the field .
And I really want a signed copy !
Heads , Bodies and Tails , oh my
I started off by gathering the rankings info ( excel version here ) for the “ Most Viewed ” videos on 7/1 and 7/3 at different times during the day .
I pulled two sets since it didnt occur to me that a daily ranking of popular files wouldnt be worth much when taken at 10 am .
I also didnt anticipate that my time and and YouTube ’s time would be different and that this might cause variances in the data but more on that later .
Anyway , with some usable ranking data in hand I then needed some total numbers to use as a benchmark .
YouTube claims that its daily viewership is 70 million , I ’ve also seen the numbers 52 million and 35 million daily views bandied about in the media so both of are in the spreadsheet .
I sent an email to the good folks at YouTube asking for the number of downloads since launch to compare against the All Time Top 100 ranking they have on the site but didnt hear back from them in time for this post .
I will add it to the Editgrid sheet if they send me that info .
If YouTube has 70 million daily views as it claims , then its tail is indeed very long .
The top 100 viewed video clips were watched just over 2 million times as of 10 am on 7/1 .
Thats 2 million out of 70 million leaving a tail 68 million views long .
The same is true on 7/3 just 1.93 million views of the top 100 clips , leaving a tail several multiples larger then the head .
Wag the dog indeed !
YouTube is currently serving 70 million videos per day to six million unique users daily , with more than 60,000 videos being uploaded per day .
- YouTube PR
With a tail as large as YouTubes , I wanted to know what traffic looked like as you moved from the top 100 clips in terms of popularity to the top 1,000 and beyond .
I called on Reggie Smith , to help answer this question .
Using powers of analysis and perception well beyond anything I posses , Reggie worked out how to apply of one of the many Power Law distributions to the data I collected which allowed me to put a viewership number on any rank along YouTubes long tail .
While all this play with Excel allowed me to chanel my deeply repressed inner MBA , the really useful insight to me is how very deep into the tail users are driven .
According to the model , even the 1,000,000th ranked video clip on YouTube would be able to gather a dedicated audience of 4 bored souls .
If you happen to be ranked the 59,998th video on the site dont fret you would still attract a whopping 40 viewers .
How do you effectivly talk to people venturing this far down the tail ?
From social involvement to consumption , how do you engage them in conversation thats meaningful and relavent ?
I ’m not a Hater I Just Read a Lot
This isnt a rant against the Long Tail , UGC ( Unnerving Grotesque Capers ) or even content aggregators ( ie middlemen Dinosaurs ) .
However , anyone that actually reads any of Chris Andersons musings on the Long Tail you ’ll note that he is talking about commerce , the buying and selling of stuff .
The observations , based on similar observations of many others , are about the increased efficiency that result when you start selling and buying online .
Despite the stories that tend to focus on the mass potential of YouTube , its real strength will never be its approximation of the broadcasting ’s large audiences and one - way messaging .
Smart marketers ready to experiment with matching advertising messages to profile info , keywords , tags , video content or even comments may be able to take advantage of YouTube ’s long tail .
The rest will ape the broadcast model in a non-broadcast medium and fail .
NOTES :
The Edit Grid model is still in development and there are two versions online .
This one will be the latest version and “ Editable ” version is left open for your ideas , contributions and corrections .

Google will have to turn over some of the data requested by the Department of Justice , according to a ruling just handed down by US District Judge James Ware .
The DoJ had subpoenaed search records from a one - week period covering 1 million random web addresses in an attempt to make its case for reviving the Child Online Protection Act , which was struck down in 2004 .
Google fought back , leading to today 's ruling .
US District Judge James
Ware ruled that Google will need to hand over a portion of the requested data to the DoJ , but has not yet specified the full scope of his ruling .
However , he indicated that he had significant reservations about requiring the search engine to comply with all of the terms of the subpoena due to the " perception by the public that this is subject to government scrutiny . "
Indeed , the entire case has brought the issue of how much privacy ( here 's a hint : very little ) Internet users can expect to have .
Google is not alone in keeping track of users ' queries and identifying information such as IP addresses and whether the searcher was signed into her Google account , to name a couple .
The ACLU had filed a brief supporting Google , citing possible violations of privacy .
For its part , Google wanted to keep the information confidential because it claimed that its release would disclose some of Google 's trade secrets and " proprietary systems . "
In addition , the company said that the government had failed to demonstrate that the data would lead to admissible evidence and that the subpoena imposed an expensive and unwarranted burden without sufficient justification .
It 's also likely that the company wants to demonstrate that it was committed to keeping data about its users out of the hands of the government during a time when it has come under scrutiny for its dealings with the People 's Republic of China .
Originally , the DoJ requested a month 's worth of search records , but later narrowed the timeframe down to a week .
In addition , it has promised to compensate Google for the costs of compliance .
By examining the data from Google and other search engines ( which apparently complied fully with the subpoena 's they received ) , the government hopes to demonstrate the ease with which filtering software designed to keep minors from viewing pornography and other content online can be circumvented .
Judge Ware expects to make the decision as to what extent Google will have to comply with the subpoena " very quickly . "
Chances are good that Google will appeal this ruling .
Absolute Powerpoint
Can a software package edit our thoughts
by Ian Parker
Before there were presentations , there were conversations , which were a little like presentations but used fewer bullet points , and no one had to dim the lights .
A woman we can call Sarah Wyndham , a defense - industry consultant living in Alexandria , Virginia , recently began to feel that her two daughters were n't listening when she asked them to clean their bedrooms and do their chores .
So , one morning , she sat down at her computer , opened Microsoft 's PowerPoint program , and typed :
Family Matters
An approach for positive change to the
Wyndham family team
On a new page , she wrote :
Lack of organization leads to confusion and frustration among all family members .
Disorganization is detrimental to grades and to your social life .
Disorganization leads to inefficiencies that impact the entire family .
Instead of pleading for domestic harmony , Sarah Wyndham was pitching for it .
Soon she had eighteen pages of large type , supplemented by a color photograph of a generic happy family riding bicycles , and , on the final page , a drawing key - the key to success .
The briefing was given only once , last fall .
The experience was so upsetting to her children that the threat of a second showing was enough to make one of the Wyndham girls burst into tears .
PowerPoint , which can be found on two hundred and fifty million computers around the world , is software you impose on other people .
It allows you to arrange text and graphics in a series of pages , which you can project , slide by slide , from a laptop computer onto a screen , or print as a booklet ( as Sarah Wyndham did ) .
The usual metaphor for everyday software is the tool , but that does n't seem to be right here .
PowerPoint is more like a suit of clothes , or a car , or plastic surgery .
You take it out with you .
You are judged by it - you insist on being judged by it .
It is by definition a social instrument , turning middle managers into bullet - point dandies .
But PowerPoint also has a private , interior influence .
It edits ideas .
It is , almost surreptitiously , a business manual as well as a business suit , with an opinion - an oddly pedantic , prescriptive opinion - about the way we should think .
It helps you make a case , but it also makes its own case : about how to organize information , how much information to organize , how to look at the world .
One feature of this is the AutoContent Wizard , which supplies templates - " Managing Organizational Change " or " Communicating Bad News , " say - that are so close to finished presentations you barely need to do more then add your company logo .
The " Motivating a Team " template , for example , includes a slide headed " Conduct a Creative Thinking Session " :
Ask :
In what ways can we ...?
- Assess the situation .
Get the facts .
- Generate possible solutions with green light , nonjudgmental thinking .
- Select the best solution .
The final injunction is " Have an inspirational close . "
It 's easy to avoid these extreme templates - many people do - as well as embellishments like clip art , animations , and sound effects .
But it 's hard to shake off AutoContent 's spirit : even the most easygoing PowerPoint template insists on a heading followed by bullet points , so that the user is shepherded toward a staccato , summarizing frame of mind , of the kind parodied , for example , in a PowerPoint Gettysburg Address posted on the Internet : " Dedicate portion of field - fitting ! "
Because PowerPoint can be an impressive antidote to fear - converting public - speaking dread into moviemaking pleasure - there seems to be no great impulse to fight this influence , as you might fight the unrelenting animated paperclip in Microsoft Word .
Rather , PowerPoint 's restraints seem to be soothing - so much so that where Microsoft has not written rules , businesses write them for themselves .
A leading U.S. computer manufacturer has distributed guidelines to its employees about PowerPoint presentations , insisting on something it calls the " Rules of Seven " : " Seven ( 7 ) bullets or lines per page , seven ( 7 ) words per line . "
Today , after Microsoft 's decade of dizzying growth , there are great tracts of corporate America where to appear at a meeting without PowerPoint would be unwelcome and vaguely pretentious , like wearing no shoes .
In darkened rooms at industrial plants and ad agencies , at sales pitches and conferences , this is how people are communicating : no paragraphs , no pronouns - the world condensed into a few upbeat slides , with seven or so words on a line , seven or so lines on a slide .
And now it 's happening during sermons and university lectures and family arguments , too .
A New Jersey PowerPoint user recently wrote in an online discussion , " Last week I caught myself planning out ( in my head ) the slides I would need to explain to my wife why we could n't afford a vacation this year . "
Somehow , a piece of software designed , fifteen years ago , to meet a simple business need has become a way of organizing thought at kindergarten show - and - tells .
" Oh , Lord , " one of the early developers said to me .
" What have we done ? "
Forty years ago , a workplace meeting was a discussion with your immediate colleagues .
Engineers would meet with other engineers and talk in the language of engineering .
A manager might make an appearance - acting as an interpreter , a bridge to the rest of the company - but no one from the marketing or production or sales department would be there .
Somebody might have gone to the trouble of cranking out mimeographs - that would be the person with purple fingers .
But the structure of American industry changed in the nineteen - sixties and seventies .
Clifford Nass , who teaches in the Department of Communication at Stanford , says , " Companies were n't discovering things in the laboratory and then trying to convince consumers to buy them .
They were discovering - or creating - consumer demand , figuring out what they can convince consumers they need , then going to the laboratory and saying , ' Build this ! '
People were saying , ' We can create demand .
Even if demand does n't exist , we know how to market this . '
SpaghettiOs is the great example .
The guy came up with the jingle first : ' The neat round spaghetti you can eat with a spoon . :
And he said , ' Hey !
Make spaghetti in the shape of small circles ! ' "
As Jerry Porras , a professor of organizational behavior and change at Stanford Graduate School of Business , says , " When technologies no longer just drove the product out but the customer sucked it out , then you had to know what the customer wanted , and that meant a lot more interaction inside the company . "
There are new conversations : Can we make this ?
How do we sell this if we make it ?
Can we do it in blue ?
America began to go to more meetings .
By the early nineteen - eighties , when the story of PowerPoint starts , employees had to find ways to talk to colleagues from other departments , colleagues who spoke a different language , brought together by SpaghettiOs and by the simple fact that technology was generating more information .
There was more to know and , as the notion of a job for life eroded , more reason to know it .
In this environment , visual aids were bound to thrive .
In 1975 , fifty thousand overhead projectors were sold in America .
By 1985 , that figure had increased to more than a hundred and twenty thousand .
Overheads , which were developed in the mid-forties for use by the police , and were then widely used in bowling alleys and schools , did not fully enter business life until the mid seventies , when a transparency film that could survive the heat of a photocopier became available .
Now anything on a sheet of paper could be transferred to an overhead slide .
Overheads were cheaper than the popular alternative , the 35 - mm slide ( which needed graphics professionals ) , and they were easier to use .
But they restricted you to your typewriter 's font - rather , your secretary 's typewriter 's font - or your skill with Letraset and a felt - tipped pen .
A businessman could n't generate a handsome , professional - looking font in his own office .
In 1980 , though , it was clear that a future of widespread personal computers - and laser printers and screens that showed the very thing you were about to print - was tantalizingly close .
In the Mountain View , California , laboratory of Bell - Northern Research , computer - research scientists had set up a great mainframe computer , a graphics workstation , a phototypesetter , and the earliest Canon laser printer , which was the size of a bathtub and took six men to carry into the building - together , a cumbersome approximation of what would later fit on a coffee table and cost a thousand dollars .
With much trial and error , and jogging from one room to another , you could use this collection of machines as a kind of word processor .
Whitfield Diffie had access to this equipment .
A mathematician , a former peacenik , and an enemy of exclusive government control of encryption systems , Diffie had secured a place for himself in computing legend in 1976 , when he and a colleague , Martin Hellman , announced the discovery of a new method of protecting secrets electronically - public - key cryptography .
At Bell - Northern , Diffie was researching the security of telephone systems .
In 1981 , preparing to give a presentation with 35 - mm. slides , he wrote a little program , tinkering with some graphics software designed by a B.N.R. colleague , that allowed you to draw a black frame on a piece of paper .
Diffie expanded it so that the page could show a number of frames , and text inside each frame , with space for commentary around them .
In other words , he produced a storyboard - a slide show on paper - that could be sent to the designers who made up the slides , and that would also serve as a script for his lecture .
( At this stage , he was n't photocopying what he had produced to make overhead transparencies , although scientists in other facilities were doing that . )
With a few days ' effort , Diffie had pointed the way to PowerPoint .
Diffie has long gray hair and likes to wear English suits .
Today , he works for Sun Microsystems , as an internal consultant on encryption matters .
I recently had lunch with him in Palo Alto , and for the first time he publicly acknowledged his presence at the birth of PowerPoint .
It was an odd piece of news : as if Lenin had invented the stapler .
Yes , he said , PowerPoint was " based on " his work at B.N.R .
This is not of great consequence to Diffie , whose reputation in his own field is so high that he is one of the few computer scientists to receive erotically charged fan mail .
He said he was " mildly miffed " to have made no money from the PowerPoint connection , but he has no interest in beginning a feud with an old friend .
" Bob was the one who had the vision to understand how important it was to the world , " he said .
" And I did n't . "
Bob is Bob Gaskins , the man who has to take final responsibility for the drawn blinds of high - rise offices around the world and the bullet points dashing across computer screens inside .
His account of PowerPoint 's parentage does not exactly match Diffie's , but he readily accepts his former colleague as " my inspiration . "
In the late nineteen - seventies and early eighties , Gaskins was B.N.R.'s head of computer - science research .
A former Berkeley Ph.D. student , he had a family background in industrial photographic supplies and grew up around overhead projectors and inks and gels .
In 1982 , he returned for a six - month overseas business trip and , with a vivid sense of the future impact of the Apple Macintosh and of Microsoft 's Windows ( both of which were in development ) , he wrote a list of fifty commercial possibilities - Arabic typesetting , menus , signs .
And then he looked around his own laboratory and realized what had happened while he was away : following Diffie 's lead , his colleagues were trying to make overheads to pitch their projects for funding , despite the difficulties of using the equipment .
( What you saw was not at all what you got . )
" Our mainframe was buckling under the load , " Gaskins says .
He now had his idea : a graphics program that would work with Windows and the Macintosh , and that would put together , and edit , a string of single pages , or " slides . "
In 1984 , he left B.N.R. , joined an ailing Silicon Valley software firm , Forethought , in exchange for a sizeable share of the company , and hired a software developer , Dennis Austin .
They began work on a program called Presenter .
After a trademark problem , and an epiphany Gaskins had in the shower , Presenter became PowerPoint .
Gaskins is a precise , bookish man who lives with his wife in a meticulously restored and furnished nineteenth - century house in the Fillmore district of San Francisco .
He has recently discovered an interest in antique concertinas .
When I visited him , he was persuaded to play a tune , and he gave me a copy of a forthcoming paper he had co-written : " A Wheatstone Twelve - Sided ' Edeophone ' Concertina with Pre-MacCann Chromatic Duet Fingering . "
Gaskins is skeptical about the product that PowerPoint has become - AutoContent and animated fades between slides - but he is devoted to the simpler thing that it was , and he led me through a well - preserved archive of PowerPoint memorabilia , including the souvenir program for the PowerPoint reunion party , in 1997 , which had a quiz filled with in - jokes about font size and programming languages .
He also found an old business plan from 1984 .
One phrase - the only one in italics - read , " Allows the content - originator to control the presentation . "
For Gaskins , that had always been the point : to get rid of the intermediaries - graphic designers - and never mind the consequences .
Whenever colleagues sought to restrict the design possibilities of the program ( to make a design disaster less likely ) , Gaskins would overrule them , quoting Thoreau : " I came into this world , not chiefly to make this a good place to live in , but to live in it , be it good or bad . "
PowerPoint 1.0 went on sale in April , 1987 - available only for the Macintosh , and only in black - and - white .
It generated text - and - graphics pages that a photocopier could turn into overhead transparencies .
( This was before laptop computers and portable projectors made PowerPoint a tool for live electronic presentations .
Gaskins thinks he may have been the first person to use the program in the modern way , in a Paris hotel in 1992 - which is like being the first person ever to tap a microphone and say , " Can you hear me at the back ? " )
The Macintosh market was small and specialized , but within this market PowerPoint - the first product of its kind - was a hit .
" I ca n't describe how wonderful it was , " Gaskins says .
" When we demonstrated at trade shows , we were mobbed . "
Shortly after the launch , Forethought accepted an acquisition offer of fourteen million dollars from Microsoft .
Microsoft paid cash and allowed Bob Gaskins and his colleagues to remain partly self - governing in Silicon Valley , far from the Microsoft campus , in Redmond , Washington .
Microsoft soon regretted the terms of the deal ; PowerPoint workers became known for a troublesome independence of spirit ( and for rewarding themselves , now and then , with beautifully staged parties - caviar , string quartets , Renaissance - period fancy dress ) .
PowerPoint had been created , in part , as a response to the new corporate world of interdepartmental communication .
Those involved with the program now experienced the phenomenon at first hand .
In 1990 , the first PowerPoint for Windows was launched , alongside Windows 3.0 .
And PowerPoint quickly became what Gaskins calls " a cog in the great machine . "
The PowerPoint programmers were forced to make unwelcome changes , partly because in 1990 Word , Excel , and PowerPoint began to be integrated into Microsoft Office - a strategy that would eventually make PowerPoint invincible - and partly in response to market research .
AutoContent was added in the mid-nineties , when Microsoft learned that some would - be presenters were uncomfortable with a blank PowerPoint page - it was hard to get started .
" We said , ' What we need is some automatic content ! ' " a former Microsoft developer recalls , laughing .
" ' Punch the button and you 'll have a presentation . ' "
The idea , he thought , was " crazy . "
And the name was meant as a joke .
But Microsoft took the idea and kept the name - a rare example of a product named in outright mockery of its target customers .
Gaskins left PowerPoint in 1992 , and many of his colleagues followed soon after .
Now rich from Microsoft stock , and beginning the concertina - collecting phase of their careers , they watched as their old product made its way into the heart of American business culture .
By 1993 , PowerPoint had a majority share of the presentation market .
In 1995 , the average user created four and a half presentations a month .
Three years later , the monthly average was nine .
PowerPoint began to appear in cartoon strips and everyday conversation .
A few years ago , Bob Gaskins was at a presentations - heavy conference in Britain .
The organizer brought the proceedings to a sudden stop , saying , " I 've just been told that the inventor of PowerPoint is in the audience - will he please identify himself so we can recognize his contribution to the advancement of science ? "
Gaskins stood up .
The audience laughed and applauded .
Cathleen Belleville , a former graphic designer who worked at PowerPoint as a product planner from 1989 to 1995 , was amazed to see a clip - art series she had created become modern business icons .
The images were androgynous silhouette stick figures ( she called them Screen Beans ) , modelled on a former college roommate : a little figure clicking its heels ; another with an inspirational light bulb above its head .
One Screen Bean .
the patron saint of PowerPoint - a figure that stands beneath a question mark , scratching its head in puzzlement - is so popular that a lawyer at a New York firm who has seen many PowerPoint presentations claims never to have seen one without the head - scratcher .
Belleville herself has seen her Beans all over the world , reprinted on baseball caps , blown up fifteen feet high in a Hamburg bank .
" I told my mom , ' You know , my artwork is in danger of being more famous than the " Mona Lisa . " ' "
Above the counter in a laundromat on Third Avenue in New York , a sign explains that no responsibility can be taken for deliveries to doorman buildings .
And there , next to the words , is the famous puzzled figure .
It is hard to understand the puzzlement .
Doorman ?
Delivery ?
But perhaps this is simply how a modern poster clears its throat :
Belleville has created the international sign for " sign . "
According to Microsoft estimates , at least thirty million PowerPoint presentations are made every day .
The program has about ninety - five per cent of the presentations - software market .
And so perhaps it was inevitable that it would migrate out of business and into other areas of our lives .
I recently spoke to Sew Meng Chung , a Malaysian research engineer living in Singapore who got married in 1999 .
He told me that , as his guests took their seats for a wedding party in the Goodwood Park Hotel , they were treated to a PowerPoint presentation : a hundred and thirty photographs - one fading into the next every four or five seconds , to musical accompaniment .
" They were baby photos , and courtship photos , and photos taken with our friends and family , " he told me .
I also spoke to Terry Taylor , who runs a Web site called eBibleTeacher.com , which supplies materials for churches that use electronic visual aids .
" Jesus was a storyteller , and he gave graphic images , " Taylor said .
" He would say , ' Consider the lilies of the field , how they grow , ' and all indications are that there were lilies in the field when he was talking , you know .
He used illustrations . "
Taylor estimates that fifteen per cent of American churches now have video projectors , and many use PowerPoint regularly for announcements , for song lyrics , and to accompany preaching .
( Taylor has seen more than one sermon featuring the head - scratching figure . )
Visitors to Taylor 's site can download photographs of locations in the Holy Land , as well as complete PowerPoint sermons - for example , " Making Your Marriage Great " :
Find out what you are doing to harm your marriage and heal it .
Financial irresponsibility
Temper
Pornography
Substance abuse
You name it !
When PowerPoint is used to flash hymn lyrics , or make a quick pitch to a new client , or produce an eye - catching laundromat poster , it 's easy to understand the enthusiasm of , say , Tony Kurz , the vice - president for sales and marketing of a New York - based Internet company , who told me , " I love PowerPoint .
It 's a brilliant application .
I can take you through at exactly the pace I want to take you . "
There are probably worse ways to transmit fifty or a hundred words of text , or information that is mainly visual - ways that involve more droning , more drifting .
And PowerPoint demands at least some rudimentary preparation : a PowerPoint presenter is , by definition , not thinking about his or her material for the very first time .
Steven Pinker , the author of " The Language Instinct " and a psychology professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , says that PowerPoint can give visual shape to an argument .
" Language is a linear medium : one damn word after another , " he says .
" But ideas are multidimensional ...
When properly employed , PowerPoint makes the logical structure of an argument more transparent .
Two channels sending the same information are better than one . "
Still , it 's hard to be perfectly comfortable with a product whose developers occasionally find themselves trying to suppress its use .
Jolene Rocchio , who is a product planner for Microsoft Office ( and is upbeat about PowerPoint in general , ) told me that , at a recent meeting of a nonprofit organization in San Francisco , she argued against a speaker 's using PowerPoint at a future conference .
" I said , ' I think we just need her to get up and speak . ' "
On an earlier occasion , Rocchio said , the same speaker had tried to use PowerPoint and the projector did n't work , " and everybody was , like , cheering .
They just wanted to hear this woman speak , and they wanted it to be from her heart .
And the PowerPoint almost alienated her audience . "
This is the most common complaint about PowerPoint .
Instead of human contact , we are given human display .
" I think that we as a people have become unaccustomed to having real conversations with each other , where actually give and take to arrive at a new answer .
We present to each other , instead of discussing , " Cathy Belleville says .
Tad Simons , the editor of the magazine " Presentations " ( whose second - grade son used PowerPoint for show - and - tell ) , is familiar with the sin of triple delivery , where precisely the same text is seen on the screen , spoken aloud , and printed on the handout in front of you ( the " leave - behind , " as it is known in some circles ) .
" The thing that makes my heart sing is when somebody pressed the ' B ' button and the screen goes black and you can actually talk to the person , " Simons told me .
In 1997 , Sun Microsystems ' chairman and C.E.O. , Scott McNealy , " banned " PowerPoint ( a ban widely disregarded by his staff ) .
The move might have been driven , in part , by Sun 's public - relations needs as a Microsoft rival , but , according to McNealy , there were genuine productivity issues .
" Why did we ban it ?
Let me put it this way :
If I want to tell my forty thousand employees to attack , the word ' attack ' in ASCII is forty - eight bits .
As a Microsoft Word document , it 's 90,112 bits .
Put that same word in a PowerPoint slide and it becomes 458,048 bits .
That 's a pig through the python when you try to send it over the Net . "
McNealy 's concern is shared by the American military .
Enormously elaborate PowerPoint files ( generated by presentation - obsessives -- so- called PowerPoint Rangers ) were said to be clogging up the military 's bandwidth .
Last year , to the delight of many under his command , General Henry H. Shelton , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , issued an order to U.S. bases around the world insisting on simpler presentations .
PowerPoint was developed to give public speakers control over design decisions .
But it 's possible that those speakers should be making other , more important decisions .
" In the past , I think we had an inefficient system , where executives passed all of their work to secretaries , " Cathy Belleville says .
" But now we 've got highly paid people sitting there formatting slides - spending hours formatting slides - because it 's more fun to do that than concentrate on what you 're going to say .
It would be much more efficient to offload that work onto someone who could do it in a tenth of the time , and be paid less .
Millions of executives around the world are sitting there going , ' Arial ?
Times Roman ?
Twenty - four point ?
Eighteen point ? ' "
In the glow of a PowerPoint show , the world is condensed , simplified , and smoothed over -- yet bright and hyperreal -- like the cityscape background in a PlayStation motor race .
PowerPoint is strangely adept at disguising the fragile foundations of a proposal , the emptiness of a business plan ; usually , the audience is respectfully still ( only venture capitalists dare to dictate the pace of someone else 's slide show ) , and , with the visual distraction of a dancing pie chart , a speaker can quickly move past the laughable flaw in his argument .
If anyone notices , it 's too late -- the narrative presses on .
Last year , three researchers at Arizona State University , including Robert Cialdini , a professor of psychology and the author of " Influence : Science and Practice , " conducted an experiment in which they presented three groups of volunteers with information about Andrew , a fictional high - school student under consideration for a university football scholarship .
One group was given Andrew 's football statistics typed on a piece of paper .
The second group was shown bar graphs .
Those in the third group were given a PowerPoint presentation , in which animated bar graphs grew before their eyes .
Given Andrew 's record , what kind of prospect was he ?
According to Cialdini , when Andrew was PowerPointed , viewers saw him as a greater potential asset to the football team .
The first group rated Andrew four and a half on a scale of one to seven ; the second rated him five ; and the PowerPoint group rated him six .
PowerPoint gave him power .
The experiment was repeated , with three groups of sports fans that were accustomed to digesting sports statistics ; this time , the first two groups gave Andrew the same rating .
But the group that saw the PowerPoint presentation still could n't resist it .
Again , Andrew got a six .
PowerPoint seems to be a way for organizations to turn expensive , expert decision - makers into novice decision - makers .
" It 's frightening , " Cialdini says .
He always preferred to use slides when he spoke to business groups , but one high - tech company recently hinted that his authority suffered as a result .
" They said , ' You know what , Bob ?
You 've got to get into PowerPoint , otherwise people are n't going to respond . '
So I made the transfer . "
Clifford Nass has an office overlooking the Oval lawn at Stanford , a university where the use of PowerPoint is so widespread that to refrain from using it is sometimes seen as a mark of seniority and privilege , like egg on one 's tie .
Nass once worked for Intel , and then got a Ph.D. in sociology , and now he writes about and lectures on the ways people think about computers .
But , before embarking on any of that , Professor Nass was a professional magician - Cliff Conjure - so he has some confidence in his abilities as a public performer .
According to Nass , who now gives PowerPoint lectures because his students asked him to , PowerPoint " lifts the floor " of public speaking : a lecture is less likely to be poor if the speaker is using the program .
" What PowerPoint does is very efficiently deliver content , " Nass told me .
" What students gain is a lot more information - not just facts but rules , ways of thinking , examples . "
At the same time , PowerPoint " lowers the ceiling , " Nass says .
" What you miss is the process .
The classes I remember most , the professors I remember most , were the ones where you could watch how they thought .
You do n't remember what they said , the details .
It was ' What an elegant way to wrap around a problem ! '
PowerPoint takes that away .
PowerPoint gives you the outcome , but it removes the process . "
" What I miss is , when I used to lecture without PowerPoint , every now and then I 'd get a cool idea , " he went on .
" I remember once it just hit me .
I 'm lecturing , and all of a sudden I go , ' God !
" The Wizard of Oz " !
The scene at the end of " The Wizard of Oz " ! ' "
Nass , telling this story , was almost shouting .
( The lecture , he later explained , was about definitions of " the human " applied to computers . )
" I just went for it -- twenty - five minutes .
And to this day students who were in that class remember it .
That could n't happen now : ' Where the hell is the slide ? ' "
PowerPoint could lead us to believe that information is all there is .
According to Nass , PowerPoint empowers the provider of simple content ( and that was the task Bob Gaskins originally set for it ) , but it risks squeezing out the provider of process -- that is to say , the rhetorician , the storyteller , the poet , the person whose thoughts cannot be arranged in the shape of an AutoContent slide .
" I hate to admit this , " Nass said , " but I actually removed a book from my syllabus last year because I could n't figure out how to PowerPoint it .
It 's a lovely book called ' Interface Culture , ' by Steven Johnson , but it 's very discursive ; the charm of it is the throwaways .
When I read this book , I thought , My head 's filled with ideas , and now I 've got to write out exactly what those ideas are , and - they 're not neat . "
He could n't get the book into bullet points ; every time he put something down , he realized that it was n't quite right .
Eventually , he abandoned the attempt , and instead of a lecture , he gave his students a recommendation .
He told them it was a good book , urged them to read it , and moved on to the next bullet point .
From the New Yorker - May 28 , 2001
Update ( March 2013 ) : C-REPL was a neat hack , but a more principled implementation of the same goal exists in Cling .
Many programming languages come with a REPL ( read - eval - print loop ) , which allows you to type in code line by line and see what it does .
This is quite useful for prototyping , experimentation , and debugging code .
Other programming languages , and especially C , use a " compile - run " model , and do n't provide a REPL .
Let 's fix that .
What you get
This approach is actually more of a read - eval loop , as c- repl does n't know much about the types and parse trees of the code it 's running .
But unlike other approaches to solving the " C interpreter " problem , c- repl works directly with unmodified libraries and system headers .
This means you can experiment with a new library without writing a test program or any bindings .
Or just use it as a simple calculator , content in knowing it is much faster than your neighbors using irb , like driving a Ferarri on city streets .
Some especially cute frosting features : - tab - completion of in - scope symbols - inspection of in - scope variables ( via the .t command )
Example Session
Here 's an example session demonstrating using c-repl :
% ./c-repl > int x = 3 > ++x > .p x int : 4 > printf ( " %d %p
" , x , &x ) 4 0xb7f1b53 c > .t fprintf fprintf ( FILE * const stream , char const * const format ) > # include < unistd.h > > getp< TAB > getpagesize getpass getpgid getpgrp getpid getppid > printf ( " %d
" , getpid ( ) ) 19094
How to get and use it
See GitHub , but c-repl is unmaintained and I do n't recommend you use it .

Disposable Personal Income as a % of GDP
On last night 's show , we discussed the vanishing savings rate ( Dismissed as unimportant by Jim Glassman ) and the Asset to Debt ratio -- which is reminscent of the same old argument in 1999 :
The asset then was equities , the asset today is real estate .
Lets now look at a different ratio :
U.S. Disposable Personal Income as a % of Gross Domestic Product ( Current $ )
Source : Mike Panzner
The total amount of money Americans have to spend after taxes relative to overall output of goods and services has hit the lowest level in 25 years .
Remember , Debts are forever , while Assets are subject to markets forces and variable pricing !

How has this Glassman guy become so famous ?
Did he tell people to get out of equities in 2000 ?
I have n't seen CNBC in a while but did n't Bernstein cohost this week or a few days this week ?
Even though he reduced his bond exposure and dumped that into stocks and cash , he 's still underweight stocks and likely upped his equity allocation because of pressure from management as so many indices are making cycle or all time highs .
Because his statements do n't jive with his actions .
He recently made the statement the earnings are the most cyclical based in 50 years and he thought we were at the earnings top .
No revelation of earnings top .
But quite a revelation in the cyclicality of the earnings .
That means earnings quality sucks and could also collapse instead of just tail off somewhat .
And the market PE is likely artificially inflated short term .
Throw in the unfunded pensions , options expensing and a few other pretty pictures including below average returns in pension investments over the next few years and you have a market that is n't so cheap .

Corrine came up with this test for psychos .
I
answered it correctly and I am NOT a psychopath ( No , I 'm not .
Shut up Joe ) .
Can you guess what my answer was ?
It 's at the bottom .
What 's your answer !
Psychopath Test
Read this question , come up with an answer and then scroll down to the bottom for the result .
This is not a trick question .
It is as it reads .
No one I know has got it right .
A woman , while at the funeral of her own mother , met a guy whom she did not know .
She thought this guy was amazing .
She believed him to be her dream guy so much , that she fell in love with him right there , But never asked for his number and could not find him .
A few days later she killed her sister .
Question :
What is her motive for killing her sister ?
[ Give this some thought before you answer , see answer below ]
Answer :
She was hoping the guy would appear at the funeral again .
If you answered this correctly , you think like a psychopath .
This was a test by a famous American Psychologist used to test if one has the same mentality as a killer .
Many arrested serial killers took part in the test and answered the question correctly .
If you did n't answer the question correctly , good for you .
If you got the answer correct , please let me know so I can take you off of my email list ...
My answer was ;
She is a psychopath .

Bush And Nixon Battle It Out ( Update )
Six months ago I graphed Bush and Nixon 's approval and disapproval ratings against each other .
With a new Gallup poll showing Bush 's approval rating at an all time low ( for Gallup ) of 34 % , I thought now would be a good time to do an update .
Note that while Bush 's approval rating is still a bit higher than Nixon 's at a comparable point in his presidency , Bush 's disapproval rating is almost exactly the same as Nixon 's just before he resigned .
In fact , at 63 % , Bush 's current disapproval rating was only exceeded by Nixon 's in two Gallup pollsÃ ƒÂ ¢ Ã¢â€ šÂ¬Ã¢â‚ ¬ÂMarch , 1974 ( 65 % ) and the final poll in July , 1974 just before Nixon left office ( 66 % ) .
For instance , in June , 1974 Nixon 's disapproval rating was only 58 % , noticeably lower than Bush 's is today .
I think this one is going down to the wire .
( All polls are Gallup . )
Could it be splitsville for Matthew McConaughey and Lance Armstrong , celebdom 's most visible new BFFs ?
A report today by New York Daily News ' Ben Widdicombe says that Jake Gyllenhaal has edged out Matt for the plum role of playing Lance in an upcoming film version of Armstrong 's life story , even though it 's been McConaughey who 's logged the most time with the cycling legend in recent weeks , as faithfully chronicled by TMZ .
The saga began in earnest last month at the Tour de France , where Lance and Jake ( himself an avid cyclist ) hung out together to watch the competition , fueling speculation that Gyllenhaal was preparing for a role in the Armstrong biopic being developed by Sony .
And then , in late July , the trio was spotted biking together in Malibu -- who knows how competitive that seemingly innocent ride must 've been , with Jake and Matt vying for Lance 's approval ?
Miami -- wine - shopping , clubbing , or having an intimate jog on the beach , in the rain .
Today , however , it seems that the seat of power has shifted . . . to Jake .
Where those driving directions really come from
On the ground with the modern mapmakers who tally , track and measure every road in America .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) - Mapquest said it would take 41 minutes for me to drive from Columbus Circle in Manhattan to Far Rockaway in Queens .
Google Maps estimated the trip at 39 minutes .
I looked at the route and figured it for an hour .
About an hour later , I was in Far Rockaway riding around with two of the people who create the raw material for driving directions like those spun out by Mapquest , Google and any number of portable navigation systems .
Navteq employees Christopher Arcari ( left ) and Jean Pierre Loize ( right ) with their specially equipped Ford Escape .
On a map inside the vehicle , a line of overlapping green arrows indicates our path .
Photo Gallery
See more photos Best Cars 2006    
Navteq supplies the raw map data that underlies those directions .
That data is n't as raw as you might think , though .
Unlike paper maps , Navteq 's digital maps have to include details about which roads are one way , which way , and things like whether left turns are illegal Monday through Friday , excluding holidays , from 7:00 a.m to 10:00 a.m. unless you 're driving a bus .
Users who rely on this data to guide them from one place to another expect an extremely high degree of accuracy .
People who use paper maps understand that their map may be old and that the map can't tell them which way they 're allowed to go at a given intersection .
People using computer programs just expect them to be right .
To check those sorts of details , Navteq relies on hundreds of Geographic Analysts like the two men I was with , Senior Geographic Analyst Christopher Arcari and Geographic Analyst I Jean Pierre Loize .
They spend about half their time driving around gathering data about every road , large and small , in their designated region of the country .
The other half of their time is spent sorting out all that data .
If you ever rely on a computer program to get you through Far Rockaway , you owe these men a good deal of thanks because , I 'll tell you , there was a lot wrong with Far Rockaway when we got there .
For starters , several blocks worth of streets were simply gone .
In what is doubtless a welcome sign of improvement for the otherwise blighted section of beachfront we were cruising through , several housing developments were going up .
Some were nearly completed and already had new streets with names like Auquatic Place and Beach Breeze Place .
Others were just fenced in plots of dirt .
Inside the white Ford Escape SUV , Arcari noted the " possible new streets " on an electronic writing pad .
As he wrote them , the words appeared overlaying a map on a computer screen attached to the vehicle 's dashboard .
Inside a locked metal box in the back of the SUV , all the changes were recorded in a laptop computer hooked up to the SUV .
The only unusual things visible from the outside of the SUV were a small white cone on top housing a high - powered satellite receiver and magnetic " Navteq " signs on the doors .
The signs could be removed to allow the SUV to travel in areas where commercial traffic is n't supposed to go .
The missing streets created a problem beyond simply making their current map inaccurate .
They also meant that the two main roads through the area were , in a routing sense , cut off from each other .
That could create a problem for you , the end user , at some point if you wanted to drive through that area .
All streets , you see , are classified by their speed limits and by a number between one and five corresponding to their suitability for long - distance driving .
A " 5 " would be a nice long stretch of interstate .
A " 1 " would be a rutted local road .
On the map displayed on the SUV 's computer screen , we could see two red roads running along for miles without connecting , then each veered off in its own direction .
That was a problem .
We had to find an appropriate road to " upgrade , " creating a link between those two roads , Rockaway Freeway and Beach Channel Drive .
We found a likely candidate in a place where the two roads veered close to one another .
Loize drove the Escape through the intersection going one way then another .
There were no signs telling us that was n't legal at any time , so there it was .
With a few pokes of his pen , Arcari upgraded the road from a " 2 " to a " 3 " .
It turned red on the map and a new bridge was created .
Then we cruised around some more , a trail of green arrows on the computer screen marking our path as we went .
A tiny video camera facing out the truck 's windshield snapped a wide - angle image every three seconds as we traveled .
The resulting images can be used to note street signs and double - check other features .
Along the way , Arcari noted road construction that needed to be checked on later .
There was a lot of road construction going on .
To do this kind of work , Loize explained to me , you have to think like a routing program .
Routing programs calculate a path based on speed limits , the suitability of roads and distance .
While Navteq supplies the raw data , the calculations are up to the routing company 's computer software .
They can't always take into account real - world traffic patterns , Arcari explained , which is one reason the results can sometimes seem a little screwy to people who drive the streets every day .
It 's also one reason my guess about how long it would take to reach Far Rockaway was so much closer than the Web sites ' estimates .
" There will always be local knowledge , " he said .
A nondescript grass discovered in the Oregon countryside is hardly an alien invasion .
Yet the plant – a genetically modified form of a grass commonly grown on golf courses – is worrying the US Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) enough that it is running its first full environmental impact assessment of a GM plant .
It is the first time a GM plant has escaped into the wild in the US , and it has managed it before securing USDA approval .
The plant , creeping bentgrass ( Agrostis stolonifera , carries a bacterial gene that makes it immune to the potent herbicide glyphosate , better known as Roundup . …
George C. Deutsch , the young presidential appointee at NASA who told public affairs workers to limit reporters ' access to a top climate scientist and told a Web designer to add the word " theory " at every mention of the Big Bang , resigned yesterday , agency officials said .
Mr. Deutsch 's resignation came on the same day that officials at Texas A&M University confirmed that he did not graduate from there , as his résumé on file at the agency asserted .
Officials at NASA headquarters declined to discuss the reason for the resignation .
" Under NASA policy , it is inappropriate to discuss personnel matters , " said Dean Acosta , the deputy assistant administrator for public affairs and Mr. Deutsch 's boss .
The resignation came as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was preparing to review its policies for communicating science to the public .
The review was ordered Friday by Michael D. Griffin , the NASA administrator , after a week in which many agency scientists and midlevel public affairs officials described to The New York Times instances in which they said political pressure was applied to limit or flavor discussions of topics uncomfortable to the Bush administration , particularly global warming .
Tact Filters
I came up with this idea several years ago in a conversation with a friend at MIT , who was regularly finding herself upset by other people who worked in her lab .
The analogy worked so well in helping her to understand her co-workers that I decided to write it up and put it on the web .
I 've gotten quite a few email messages since then from other people who have also found it helpful .
All people have a " tact filter " , which applies tact in one direction to everything that passes through it .
Most " normal people " have the tact filter positioned to apply tact in the outgoing direction .
Thus whatever normal people say gets the appropriate amount of tact applied to it before they say it .
This is because when they were growing up , their parents continually drilled into their heads statements like , " If you ca n't say something nice , do n't say anything at all ! "
" Nerds , " on the other hand , have their tact filter positioned to apply tact in the incoming direction .
Thus , whatever anyone says to them gets the appropriate amount of tact added when they hear it .
This is because when nerds were growing up , they continually got picked on , and their parents continually drilled into their heads statements like , " They 're just saying those mean things because they 're jealous .
They do n't really mean it . "
When normal people talk to each other , both people usually apply the appropriate amount of tact to everything they say , and no one 's feelings get hurt .
When nerds talk to each other , both people usually apply the appropriate amount of tact to everything they hear , and no one 's feelings get hurt .
However , when normal people talk to nerds , the nerds often get frustrated because the normal people seem to be dodging the real issues and not saying what they really mean .
Worse yet , when nerds talk to normal people , the normal people 's feelings often get hurt because the nerds do n't apply tact , assuming the normal person will take their blunt statements and apply whatever tact is necessary .
So , nerds need to understand that normal people have to apply tact to everything they say ; they become really uncomfortable if they can't do this .
Normal people need to understand that despite the fact that nerds are usually tactless , things they say are almost never meant personally and should n't be taken that way .
Both types of people need to be extra patient when dealing with someone whose tact filter is backwards relative to their own .
Reflections on this Essay after Ten Years
During the ten years since I wrote up the Tact Filter theory and put it on the ( then fledgeling ) web , I 've gotten quite a bit of fan mail about it .
I 've been tempted to make some minor edits ( such as substituting " geek " for " nerd " ) , but I think that 's better left to this addendum .

Amid all the brouhaha over whether I. Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , Karl Rove , or any number of Bush administration insiders had a hand in leaking the name of covert CIA agent Valerie Plame , the essential crime at the core of the investigation  and its probable starting point  often gets lost in the shuffle .
The “ outing ” of Plame was not an end in itself : the outers did n’t just one day decide that they were going to go after her and Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson , her husband , because they were in a vindictive mood .
They were out to get them because Wilson drew attention to the provenance of the infamous “ 16 words ” uttered by President Bush in his 2003 state of the union address , in which Bush claimed that Iraq had sought out uranium in “ an African country ” in order to make a nuclear bomb .
Perhaps without knowing it , Wilson  in taking an interest in this subject  was getting too close to the enormous fraud at the center of the War Party ’s propaganda campaign .
The African country Bush spoke of is Niger , where much of the world ’s uranium is mined under the watchful eye of a French consortium  and where it would be extremely difficult , if not close to impossible , for the Iraqis to walk off with the tons of uranium required to produce weapons - grade materials .
This accountability issue was no doubt a major reason for the skepticism the Niger uranium story engendered in Ambassador Wilson , who was sent to Niger by the CIA to check out the facts  and came back with a negative report .
Wilson was therefore shocked to hear the president reiterate a claim that had been previously and definitively debunked , and went public with his mission and its results  but not before the source of that claim had been brutally and publicly refuted by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
In early October 2002 , Italian journalist Elisabetta Burba , a writer for Italy ’s Panorama magazine , delivered some documents to the U.S. embassy in Rome : a cache of letters and other papers purporting to be correspondence between officials of the Niger government and the Iraqis relating to the acquisition of uranium “ yellowcake . ”
The documents soon found their way to Washington , D.C. , where key administration officials were quick to incorporate them into their “ talking points ” for war with Iraq  and into Bush ’s Jan. 28 , 2003 speech .
When the IAEA asked to see evidence of the administration ’s contentions , they were put off , until finally the Niger uranium documents were handed over .
It took IAEA scientists just a few hours to demonstrate that the documents were not only forgeries , but were particularly crude ones at that  an amateur could have debunked them using Google .
As the Washington Post reported , one administration official ’s response was “ We fell for it . “
And how !  but that was n’t the end of it , by any means .
After all , someone had deliberately set up the American government with false information and badly embarrassed George W. Bush , who had taken the Niger uranium canard and run with it in a very public way .
An investigation was launched just as Robert Novak ’s column outing Plame appeared  mid-July 2003 .
Whoever leaked Plame ’s name and CIA affiliation was trying to scare off any further inquiries into the whole Niger uranium funny business , underscoring the key question in all this : who was behind the Niger uranium forgeries ?
Even as the FBI was following the trail of the forgers , the Italians were looking into the matter from their end .
A parliamentary committee was charged with investigating , and they issued a heavily redacted report : now , I am told by a former CIA operations officer , the report has aroused some interest on this side of the Atlantic .
According to a source in the Italian embassy , Patrick J. “ Bulldog ” Fitzgerald asked for and “ has finally been given a full copy of the Italian parliamentary oversight report on the forged Niger uranium document , ” the former CIA officer tells me :
“ Previous versions of the report were redacted and had all the names removed , though it was possible to guess who was involved .
This version names Michael Ledeen as the conduit for the report and indicates that former CIA officers Duane Clarridge and Alan Wolf were the principal forgers .
All three had business interests with Chalabi . ”
Alan Wolf died about a year and a half ago of cancer .
He served as chief of the CIA ’s Near East Division as well as the European Division , and was also CIA chief of station in Rome after Clarridge .
According to my source , “ he and Clarridge and Ledeen were all very close and also close to Chalabi . ”
The former CIA officer says Wolf “ was Clarridge ’s Agency godfather .
Significantly , both Clarridge and Wolf also spent considerable time in the Africa division , so they both had the Africa and Rome connection and both were close to Ledeen , closing the loop . ”
A veteran of the Iran - Contra scandal , Ledeen played an important role in the “ arms for hostages ” scheme by setting up meetings between the American government and the Iranian arms dealer Manucher Ghorbanifar .
Not all that unexpected coming from a self - proclaimed advocate of Machiavelli ’s amoralism .
Today , Ledeen is among the most visible and radical neoconservative ideologues whose passion for a campaign of serial “ regime - change ” in the Middle East is undiminished by the Iraqi debacle .
Just as the Roman senator Cato the Elder finished his perorations with the command “ Carthage must be destroyed , ” so Michael “ Creative Destruction ” Ledeen closes his hopped - up warmongering essays with “ Faster , please ! , ” an exhortation presumably addressed to his confreres in the Bush administration .
Ledeen has kept the neocon faith  and the same friends  for all these years .
He ’s still buddies with Ghorbanifar .
In December 2001 , he had a meeting in Rome with Ghorbanifar in the company of the Pentagon ’s top Iran specialist , Larry Franklin , and Harold Rhode , assigned to the Office of Net Assessment , a Pentagon think tank .
Also at the Rome conclave : a number of Ghorbanifar ’s Iranian friends , including a former senior official of the Revolutionary Guard .
Rounding out the distinguished guest list , we have the Italian delegation , consisting of SISMI head honcho Nicolo Pollari , the head of Italy ’s military intelligence agency , and Italian Defense Minister Antonio Martino , a neocon favorite .
Once again , Ledeen plays the middleman  but what kind of a deal was he trying to negotiate ?
Franklin , we now know , was busy spying for Israel during this period , handing over classified information to AIPAC officials Steve Rosen and Keith Weissman : he has been indicted and has turned state ’s evidence : the trial is set to begin in January .
To this day , Franklin maintains he was just trying to get AIPAC ’s assistance in moving a more pro-Israel agenda in policymaking circles .
Rhode is an ideologue of a similar coloration .
Together with Franklin , Rhode helped set up the Defense Department ’s Office of Special Plans , which stove - piped phony “ intelligence ” provided by Ahmed Chalabi‘s Iraqi National Congress and hyped the case for war .
Rhode and Franklin worked hand in hand with Chalabi , and , as United Press International intelligence correspondent Richard Sale reports , they had certain interests in common :
“ According to one former senior U.S. intelligence official who maintained excellent contacts with serving U.S. intelligence officials in the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad , ‘ Rhode practically lived out of ( Ahmed ) Chalabi ’s office . ’
This same source quoted the intelligence official with the CPA as saying , ‘ Rhode was observed by CIA operatives as being constantly on his cell phone to Israel , ’ and that the information that the intelligence officials overheard him passing to Israel was ‘ mind - boggling , ’ this source said .
It dealt with U.S. plans , military deployments , political projects , discussion of Iraq assets , and a host of other sensitive topics , the former senior U.S. intelligence official said . ”
No wonder my source tells me that “ Fitzgerald asked the Italians if he could share the report with Paul McNulty , ” the prosecutor in the AIPAC case .
There are plenty of links between the two investigations : they are , in a sense , the same investigation , since many of the same people are involved .
McNulty is delving into a single aspect of the cabal ’s activities , while Fitzgerald seems to have broadened his probe to include not only the outing of Plame , but also the origin of the Niger uranium forgeries and other instances of classified information leakage via the vice president ’s office .
I am hardly the first to implicate Ledeen in connection with the Niger uranium forgeries .
Former CIA counterterrorism officials Vince Cannistraro and Larry Johnson have pointed the finger in Ledeen ’s direction .
As the latter put it :
“ Italy ’s SISME [ sic ] also reportedly had a hand in producing the forged documents delivered to the U.S. embassy in Rome in early October 2003 [ sic : should be 2002  Ed. ] that purported to show a deal with Iraq to buy uranium .
Many in the intelligence community are convinced that a prominent neocon with long - standing ties to SISME played a role in the forgery .
The truth of that proposition remains to be proven .
This much is certain , either SISME or someone with ties to SISME , helped forge and circulate those documents which some tried to use to bolster the case to go to war with Iraq . ”
Cannistraro , asked by an interviewer if Ledeen was involved with the forgers , said “ you ’d be very close . ”
The cast of characters involved in Niger - gate is like old home week in the government scandal sweepstakes .
Aside from Ledeen , whose storied ( or is that checkered ? ) history is well - known , we have Clarridge , first head of the Counterterrorism Center set up by Bill Casey under Reagan , who deserves a column all by himself .
His close relationship with Ledeen dates from his time as chief of station in Rome in the late 1970s .
Clarridge was indicted for lying to prosecutors during the Iran - Contra imbroglio , but given a presidential pardon .
His book , A Spy for All Seasons , was the first real “ tell - all ” book about the Agency .
During the Reagan administration , he purportedly was the intellectual author of the notorious “ Psychological Operations in Guerilla Warfare , ” a CIA how - to manual instructing the Nicaraguan contras in the fine art of terrorism , including bombings , assassinations , and violence directed at noncombatants .
It was Clarridge who came up with the bright idea of mining Nicaragua ’s harbors , which led to the unprecedented condemnation of the U.S. government ’s actions in the World Court .
He was reportedly slated to become a top counterterrorism official in the National Security Council , but was nixed .
He now lives in San Diego , Calif. , and pursues a number of business and ideological interests , including Dax Resources Corp. , which runs a 24 - hour Global Response Center and advertises its facility at kidnap prevention and counterterrorism , noting that “ we can also undertake special operations , including technical countermeasures . ”
The Niger uranium forgeries surely qualify as “ technical countermeasures , ” popping up as they did just as the administration ‘s assertions about Iraq ’s alleged nuclear ambitions and capability were being questioned .
As Seymour Hersh pointed out , CIA director George Tenet appeared at a crucial congressional briefing , on the eve of the vote on authorizing the war , and
“ Declared , as he had done before , that a shipment of high - strength aluminum tubes that was intercepted on its way to Iraq had been meant for the construction of centrifuges that could be used to produce enriched uranium .
The suitability of the tubes for that purpose had been disputed , but this time the argument that Iraq had a nuclear program under way was buttressed by a new and striking fact : the CIA had recently received intelligence showing that , between 1999 and 2001 , Iraq had attempted to buy five hundred tons of uranium oxide from Niger , one of the world ’s largest producers . ”
The story of how the Niger uranium forgeries got past all the safeguards , how the actual documents were never seen by the CIA until after the president ’s 2003 speech , and who was pushing to include a reference to Saddam ’s alleged efforts to procure uranium in “ an African nation ” as one of the president ’s major talking points  these are all subjects of interest to a prosecutor attempting to prove charges of conspiracy to lie us into war .
There must be a special law that covers government employees , including high officials , who transmit tainted information and poison the well of U.S. intelligence - gathering efforts .
I ’m sure Fitzgerald will have no trouble finding it .
Fitzgerald ’s reported interest in the Italian parliamentary report indicates just how his investigation is broadening .
The forgeries , the lies fed to us by Ahmed Chalabi and his fellow “ heroes in error , ” the leakage of vital U.S. secrets to the Iranians  all point to the existence of the conspiracy the prosecutor is tasked with uncovering .
In the course of their campaign of deception , the conspirators not only outed a CIA agent who was working in the vital area of nuclear proliferation , they also passed on classified information to foreign nationals , including the Israelis and the Iranians .
They committed forgery and God knows what other crimes .
Before Fitzgerald is done , we ’ll see the warlords of Washington hauled before a court of the people .
We ’ll hear the whole sordid story of how a band of exiles , at least two foreign intelligence agencies , and a cabal of neoconservatives inside the Pentagon and the vice president ’s office bamboozled Congress and the American people into going to war .
As the indictments come down , so will the elaborate narrative so carefully constructed by the War Party in the run-up to war be exposed as a tissue of fabrication , forgery , and fraud .
The 90 million - year - old dinosaur was excavated from a site in central Argentina
Enlarge Image
The 90 million - year - old reptile belongs to the same sickle - clawed group of dinosaurs as Velociraptor and feathered dinosaurs from China .
Buitreraptor gonzalezorum , from the Neuquén Basin in central Argentina may provide tantalising evidence that powered flight evolved twice .
Details of the discovery appear in the academic journal Nature .
One theory suggests the lineage of dinosaurs the new animal belonged to , the dromaeosaurs , originated in the Cretaceous Period ( 144 to 65 million years ago ) .
But this discovery suggests their lineage can be traced further back in time , to the Jurassic ( 206 to 144 million years ago ) , experts say .
Continental movement
It would mean dromaeosaurs were around when the present - day continents of Earth were organised into a single landmass .
This giant landmass later split into northern and southern parts , called Laurasia and Gondwana respectively .
The animal was about the size of a rooster
These include Giganotosaurus , a 13 - 14 m - long behemoth that is the largest known meat - eating dinosaur .
Until recently , the dinosaur group had only been found in Cretaceous rocks of Asia and North America , continents that were part of Laurasia .
The new discovery , named Buitreraptor , provides definitive evidence that dromaeosaurs also lived in South America - part of Gondwana .
They must have originated when all of the continents were still assembled in a single landmass - during the Jurassic .
When the landmass split in two , the dromaeosaurs diverged into northern and southern groups .
Family rift
Analysis by the authors of the Nature paper show Buitreraptor and Rahonavis , a fossil animal from Madagascar previously considered a primitive bird , form a southern branch of the dromaeosaur family tree .
This branch is distinct from Laurasian dromaeosaurids , including Velociraptor and some of the famous feathered dinosaurs from China .
Birds are commonly thought to have evolved from this group .
The authors say the discovery Rahonavis and Buitreraptor have long and wing - like forelimbs could imply that flight evolved twice , once in birds and once among this group of Gondwanan dromaeosaurs .
The specimen will be on show at the Chicago Field Museum 's Evolving Planet exhibition that opens in March .
This is Beirut is designed to give voice to the millions of Lebanese who are suffering while the world sits silently .
We are not interested in propagating hatred .
We want the world to witness through the eyes of Lebanese citizens the destruction and the suffering that has been brought on in the name of defense .

Local 75 officers failed city drug tests Cocaine use most prevalent , raising concern Since Boston police started annual drug testing in 1999 , 75 officers have failed the tests , and 26 of them flunked a second test and were fired , newly released statistics show .
Acting Police Commissioner Albert Goslin said an additional 20 of the officers who tested positive left the department on their own , which he said is because they could not handle the frequent follow - up checks .
Of the 75 officers , 61 tested positive for cocaine , 14 for marijuana , two for ecstasy , and one for heroin , according to the figures , obtained by the Globe through a public records request .
( Some officers had more than one drug in their system ) .
Some specialists and department observers said they were alarmed by the number of officers testing positive for a ``hard " drug such as cocaine and questioned the department 's policy that allows an officer to remain on the force after a positive drug test .
An officer is not fired until a second positive test .
`` It seems like it's a chronic problem , " said Darnell A. Williams , president and CEO of the Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts .
`` Here we 're trying to deal with the guns and the drugs on the street level , but we have a more strident problem inside the department when we have that many people testing positive for drugs , especially cocaine . "
The department 's drug testing policy is already under scrutiny , after reports that the alleged ringleader in a corruption case tested positive for cocaine in 1999 , yet kept his job under the rules that call only for suspensions and treatment even for positive tests for drugs such as cocaine and heroin .
Unlike Boston , the New York and Los Angeles police departments dismiss officers after a first positive drug test .
Eugene O'Donnell , a former New York City police officer who is now a professor of police studies at John Jay College of Criminal Justice , said he believes the Boston police may have an unusually high number of hard - drug users because of its two - strikes policy .
The New York Police Department has a very low drug test failure rate because of its zero tolerance policy , he said .
`` Once you establish that people are fired , it does change the complexion , " he said .
`` If an agency says you can use drugs . . . it stands to reason you 're going to have a higher rate of people using drugs . "
While 75 Boston officers failed drug tests out of a total force of about 2,000 sworn officers since 1999 , at the much larger Los Angeles Police Department , 14 officers have flunked the drug test since March 2000 .
It employs 9,354 officers , of whom about 3,000 are subjected to random urine tests each year .
A spokeswoman for the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration said that of the 150,000 federal employees who took random drug tests in 2004 , 0.4 percent failed .
In 1999 , when the most Boston officers failed drug tests , the rate was more than double that , about 1.1 percent .
Goslin said the testing policy and treatment have cut the number of positive tests since then .
Boston police test for cocaine , heroin , amphetamines , PCP , and marijuana -- the standard list recommended by the federal government for workplace testing .
Officers can also be tested for other drugs with reasonable suspicion .
Officers are tested before they join the force , again while on probationary duty , then annually within 30 days of their birthday .
They are also tested if they get promoted or assigned to a special unit such as narcotics or organized crime .
If they test positive for any drug , officers receive a 45 - day unpaid suspension and must get treatment .
Once they return to duty , they are subject to random testing for three years , in addition to regular testing .
Goslin said it is not fair to compare the department to other law enforcement agencies , which he said typically use a less sophisticated urinalysis test that does not detect drugs taken more than a few days before the test .
He said the Boston police method of testing officers ' hair is more reliable and can catch drug use dating back three months .
``I would expect our rate to be higher , " Goslin said in an interview .
Los Angeles police test urine for drugs , and New York police test hair .
Goslin also said that Boston police test every officer annually , which is more regularly than many police departments , where a smaller number of officers are tested at random each year .
Therefore , he said , all officers are n't screened consistently .
The annual testing began in 1999 after years of negotiating with the city 's powerful police unions , which had objected to the tests .
In exchange for salary and benefit increases , the unions agreed to a system that gives officers warning by scheduling tests within 30 days of their birthday .
The city 's hair - testing method has also been disputed .
Fifty - seven percent of officers who failed an initial drug test since 1999 were African - American , which troubles critics who believe blacks are more likely to get false positive results because of the texture of their hair .
Last year , seven former Boston police officers -- all African - Americans who lost their jobs because of what they say were false positives -- sued the department , alleging the hair test is biased .
The suit is pending .
Goslin defended the test .
`` The science is very good and can withstand any level of scrutiny , " he said .
Goslin said he is not surprised that the vast majority of officers who failed the tests had used cocaine .
`` In the '60s it would be marijuana ; now it seems to be cocaine , " he said .
But Mark A. de Bernardo , a labor lawyer in Virginia who is executive director of the Institute for a Drug - Free Workplace , said he is startled by the number of Boston officers who used cocaine .
He said that while no one tracks national numbers on law enforcement officers who test positive for drugs , it is unusual for so many of the positive results to be for cocaine .
`` In typical drug testing , the number of marijuana positives is going to be three , four , five times the number of cocaine positives , " he said .
`` That 's alarming that cocaine would seem to be the drug of choice for the drug abusers in the Boston Police Department . "
He said the number of drug - using officers might be higher than what the testing shows because of the predictability of Boston 's annual testing .
``Anybody who fails a drug test when they know a year advance within 30 days of when it 's going to be . . . is a person who I consider to be an addict , " he said .
``I 'd assume that this is just a percentage of those that actually engage in actual drug use because it 's not true random testing . "
He also said that by giving officers a second chance , Boston police are straying from the standard set by most other employees where workers are responsible for public safety .
However , the Urban League 's Williams said he believes the department is right to give officers a second chance , especially since in many cases it seems to work .
Of the 75 officers who tested positive since 1999 , only about a third failed a second test .
Goslin said after the initial wave of positive tests in 1999 , the policy has successfully cut drug use .
``People took the policy seriously and went to get help on their own , and that caused the numbers to drop drastically , " he said .
`` And it dropped every year the policy has been in existence . "

The US has not put in place measures to limit its emissions , and the Inuit are bearing the brunt
Donald Goldberg
The Inuit Circumpolar Conference ( ICC ) claims the US is failing to control emissions of greenhouse gases , damaging livelihoods in the Arctic .
Its petition to the Inter - American Commission on Human Rights demands that the US limits its emissions .
Temperatures in the Arctic are rising at about twice the global average .
The Arctic Climate Impact Assessment , a vast scientific study which took four years to compile , found that the region will warm by four to seven degrees Celsius by the end of the century , with summer sea ice disappearing within 60 years .
Anecdotal evidence suggests that impacts are already being felt , with seasonal melting leading to the collapse of buildings and a reduction in some fish stocks .
The petition , filed on behalf of the ICC by the Center for International Environmental Law ( CIEL ) , says US policies on greenhouse gas emissions are a major factor driving these changes .
" The United States is the world 's largest greenhouse gas emitter ; it has turned its back on the Kyoto Protocol and has not put in place measures to limit its emissions , " said CIEL 's senior attorney Donald Goldberg .
" The Inuit are bearing the brunt , " he told the BBC News website .
Violation of rights
The petition asks the Inter - American Commission on Human Rights to investigate the harm caused to Inuit by global warming , and to declare the US " ... in violation of rights affirmed in the 1948 American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man and other instruments of international law . "
If the Commission rules in favour of the Inuit , it could refer the US to the Inter - American Court of Human Rights for a legal judgement .
Both the Commission and the Court work within the framework of the American Convention on Human Rights .
As the US has not ratified the Convention , a ruling by the Commission would be largely symbolic ; but Donald Goldberg believes that does not make it worthless .
" If the Commission finds the US has violated human rights , it 's a serious matter , " he said .
" States do n't like to be classified as violators of human rights ; and in any case , there is a domestic legal mechanism called the Alien Torts Claims
Act which might allow us to use a Commission judgement in national litigation . "
The petition is the latest in a series of legal or quasi-legal cases filed against the US government and others over climate change .
The US is being asked to protect coral species threatened by climate change , Australian authorities have been forced to review procedures plans for approving coal - fired power stations , while an application in Germany would force the government to declare what greenhouse gas emissions are produced by projects supported by its export credit agency .
The biggest victory for legal campaigns on climate , co-ordinated by the group Climate Justice , came in November when a Nigerian court ordered oil companies to stop " gas flaring " - burning off gas from their oil wells .

Top court turns down Wal - Mart -- cities can ban big - box stores / Justices decline to take up appeal of Turlock ordinance

Top court turns down Wal - Mart -- cities can ban big - box stores / Justices decline to take up appeal of Turlock ordinance 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
The California Supreme Court rejected Wal - Mart 's appeal Wednesday of a ruling that allows cities and counties in the state to outlaw big - box superstores .
The April 5 ruling by the Court of Appeal in Fresno upheld an ordinance enacted in 2004 by Turlock ( Stanislaus County ) that was backed by neighborhood supermarkets and labor unions .
The court , setting a statewide precedent , said local governments can enact such restrictions to prevent the collapse of local businesses and resulting urban blight .
The state 's high court denied review Wednesday without comment .
It was Turlock 's second legal victory over Wal - Mart this month .
On July 3 , a federal judge in Fresno dismissed the company 's constitutional challenge to the ordinance , saying the city was not interfering with interstate commerce or discriminating illegally against one type of store .
Rick Jarvis , a lawyer for Turlock , said Wednesday 's state court action allows a city to " make its own land - use plans and decide for itself what 's good for the community . "
It will also " make it much more difficult for Wal - Mart to file expensive legal challenges against other jurisdictions that decide to adopt similar ordinances , " he said .
Wal - Mart spokesman John Simley said the company was disappointed but believed the effect of the Turlock law would be limited .
The appeals court ruling " is narrowly based on facts that are specific to Turlock , " he said .
He said Wal - Mart had not yet decided whether to appeal last week 's federal court ruling .
The Arkansas - based retail giant has been trying to establish a California network of discount supercenters -- stores that exceed 100,000 square feet and contain full - size grocery stores -- and has encountered resistance .
Wal - Mart estimates that 20 cities and counties in Northern California have passed ordinances seeking to limit or block the stores .
San Francisco , Oakland and Martinez have banned them .
A ban on supercenters in unincorporated areas of Contra Costa County was enacted by the Board of Supervisors in 2003 but repealed by voters in 2004 .
Alameda County supervisors then rescinded a similar ordinance , but adopted a more limited measure this March that requires big - box retailers to describe the effect of new stores on the local economy and give details of employees ' pay and benefits .
Turlock has a Wal - Mart store but responded to the company 's plans for a supercenter by passing the ordinance in 2004 .
Without mentioning Wal - Mart , the law prohibits any retail store larger than 100,000 feet that devotes more than 5 percent of its space to nontaxable items such as groceries .
The City Council said the purpose was to preserve neighborhood shopping centers .
In its April 5 ruling , the appeals court said the city 's motives were legal , even if its action hurt competition .
" While zoning ordinances may not legitimately be used to control economic competition , they may be used to address the urban / suburban decay " that can result from the entry of a large new business , the court said .
The case is Wal - Mart Stores vs. Turlock , S143488 .
A UK student is flogging pixels on a web page to help raise $ 1 m to fund his way through university .
Alex Tew , 21 , who will be reading Business Management , says people can buy the pixels to display an ad or a logo on his Million Dollar Homepage which in turn can create a link to their website .
The pixels are sold in squares of 100 to create a tiddly icon .
Larger groupings can also be bought to make logos stand out .
Tew told El Reg that the scheme was all " legit and completely above board " .
" I think this will mostly appeal to businesses and perhaps larger companies will buy up lots of pixels to have a more prominent position on the site , " he said .
Faced with the spiralling cost of tuition fees and beer , Tew said he would rather " not to be riddled with debt when I graduate , so I decided to think of a way to make money before I start " .
And if he ends up with any extra cash left after his studies he plans to plough that money into a business .
So far Tew has sold more than a 1,000 pixels , including 100 to a dating network , 100 to a marketing firm and 400 to his brother 's go - karting business .
Sheesh - what some people will do to raise a bit of cash .
Last year Bristol University student Rosie Reid raised £ 8,400 by auctioning her virginity online to help fund her education .
And there are plenty of people prepared to have logos tattooed on their bodies for some dosh , mostly from GoldenPalace.com . ®
Pablo Picasso , the first living artist to be featured in the Louvre , influenced the artistic world in a uniquely original way .
So why is he known for saying “ Good artists copy , great artists steal ” ?
It ’s true .
Picasso really said , “ Good artists copy , great artists steal . ”
Or at least , since his death in 1973 , everyone believes he said that .
But why ?
Why would someone as original as Picasso say something as ironic as that ?
And what did he mean ?
Google Picasso’s quote , and you ’ll find plenty of opinions and interpretations as to what he really meant .
My intent here , then , is to uncover one possible interpretation .
This interpretation involves three levels of design , each of which :
involves some aspect of copying or stealing , shows increasing design maturity , and adapts Picasso ’s quote to modern graphic design .
Three Levels of Design
To help you understand my reasoning , I ’ve segmented this interpretation into three levels .
Are these the only three levels of design ?
Of course not .
They ’re only a guide to help improve your design maturity as related to copying and stealing .
I ’ve included short case studies to effectively demonstrate the primary concept at each level — at least , that ’s the intent .
You be the judge as to whether or not they ’re effective examples .
Level 1 : Copy , Do n’t Create
I ’m all for being as original as possible , but a beginning Web designer ( or any designer , for that matter ) should start out by copying other well - created designs .
Gerry McGovern , Web copywriting guru , makes the same argument for writers :
One of the simplest tricks that professional writers learn can greatly ease the process of getting ready to write : look for a model of the kind of article you need to do , then dissect it , analyze it – and copy it .
. . .
Novice writers often make two mistakes : they think they need to be entirely original , and they think they need to wait for “ inspiration . ”
Take it from the pros : for most kinds of writing , originality and inspiration are overrated .
Replace the instances of “ writers ” and “ writing ” in Gerry ’s quote with “ designers ” and “ Web design ” and the message is the same : copy , do n’t create .
Surprisingly , there ’s a positive side effect to copying : conventionality .
Building on the same foundation as other sites — specifically , layout and information architecture — often leads to intuitiveness and familiarity for the end user .
By no mistake do BarnesAndNoble.com and Amazon.com have similar navigation structures .
Additionally , if your career is anything like mine , you hardly ever enjoy the luxury Michelangelo relished as he expended four long years completing the Sistine Chapel ceiling .
Often , we have only four months — more likely , four weeks .
So , in a commercial art environment such as Web design , copying is almost mandatory , given the time constraints and budget limitations we face .
Case Study
The source :
The result :
IDI ’s corporate Website , created over two years ago , exemplifies Level 1 design very appropriately .
Most of us working on the project at the time — including myself , the Art Director — had less than two years of Web design experience .
We needed a polished source to act as the foundation for the layout of our site .
After hours of searching , we found that Nike ’s Canada Website was the perfect fit .
The design style was technically appealing .
The layout architecture was simple , yet strong .
The only thing lacking was additional text to draw visitors in .
So we took Nike ’s design and ran with it .
You do n’t have to struggle to see the adapted result is close to the original source .
Level 2 : Steal From Yourself
Simply put , one of the best sources from which you can steal is yourself .
Think about it .
You probably have a folder on your hard drive that contains dozens of designs that were never used or completed .
You ’ve created designs that have been a success with clients .
And more importantly , your distinctive design style is probably a selling point for many of your clients .
Why not tap into some of the great work you ’ve created that was either unused or never fully completed ?
Or even better , reinvent some of your work that was highly successful in establishing your personal style ?
Case Study
The source :
The result :
The final design for the ARRAY Website was the result of discarded design usage .
The QuicksiteBuilder layout was created a few years ago , but never made it past the comping stage ( notice the filler text and Rubberball watermark on the comp graphic ) .
Instead of starting at ground zero with the ARRAY Website — which did make it to production — I chose to create the layout using elements from the unused QuicksiteBuilder comp design .
QuicksiteBuilder and ARRAY are similar products , making a ‘ steal ’ the ideal solution .
The style established by the photo of the woman , the headline and sub - headline , and the three column highlights were all a direct result of personal stealing .
Level 3 : Steal From Discrete Sources
A good design friend of mine , Jesse Bennett , adorns his signature on message board posts with a quote by Albert Einstein : “ The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources . ”
Perhaps the easiest way to ‘ hide ’ your sources is simply to use sources that are already hidden .
“ Picasso hardly meant that great artists steal popular designs whose original source is known to everyone , ” says Wes George , writer for The Mac Observer and financial Mac nut .
“ What Picasso did mean was that great artists rummage through the great junk heap of lost , bypassed , and forgotten ideas to find the rare jewels , and then incorporate such languishing gems into their own personal artistic legacy …
Picasso implied that great artists do n’t get caught stealing because what they appropriate they transform so thoroughly into their own persona , that everyone ends up thinking the great idea was theirs in the first place . ”
Level 3 entails the difficult process of searching through magazines , books , Websites , historical artifacts , cultural compositions and other rich design sources to locate those unused and forgotten ideas
Wes speaks of .
Case Study
The source :
The result :
Recently , I was asked to design the logo for a T - shirt to be offered to IDI ’s Quality Assurance ( QA ) department .
The design for the logo shown above was ‘ stolen ’ from MasterClips ’ vector clip art collection .
As I thumbed through the catalog , I somehow landed on the clip art shown in red .
Although created years ago , the looped design had a trendy Generation X feel to it — exactly what I was looking for , as the majority of the QA department were Gen X’ers .
The chances of someone else having used this particular piece of clip art were very slim .
And the chances of the intended audience — or anyone else for that matter — being familiar with such a piece were even slimmer .
Translation ?
A perfect source for stealing .
A Warning
This article would n’t be complete without a warning to be careful when copying well - known sources .
If I were to summarize this warning in one sentence , this would be my golden verbiage : copy the inspiration , not the outcome .
For example , since the introduction of the iMac , Apple ’s design has been inspired by a very liquid and visually tangible look and feel , coupled with a “ less is more ” attitude .
A beautifully rendered copy of the inspiration behind Apple ’s design leads to something like MailFrontier.com
At the opposite end of the spectrum , a horribly blatant copy of the outcome of Apple ’s design leads to something like uSight.com
In short , be careful what you copy , and how you copy .
Take the time to make the design your own , or you ’ll land a spot as the latest design thief on Pirated - Sites.com .

Health insurance costs rise 7.7 % , twice the rate of inflation Workers and employers wo n't find much comfort in the smallest increase in health insurance costs since 1999 .
The 7.7 % increase this year is still more than twice the rate of inflation .
And those rising costs have so far failed to boost the percentage of employers offering what are touted by some , including President Bush , as an answer to health care inflation : high - deductible insurance policies coupled with savings accounts .
Despite being the biggest buzz among benefit consultants , the Kaiser Family Foundation says only 7 % of employers offered such policies this year , unchanged from 2005 .
The results come from the non-profit foundation 's annual employer survey , released Tuesday .
SMALL BUSINESS CONNECTION :
In health insurance costs , small firms suffer again " This shows that the debate in the media and in Washington health policy circles is way out in front of the reality , " says Drew Altman , president of the non-profit research group in Menlo Park , Calif .
Other results from the survey : • Among all types of health insurance , what employers paid rose 7.7 % this year , smallest increase since 1999 , but still more than twice overall inflation .
•
The most common type of insurance , a preferred provider organization plan , averaged $ 11,765 for a family and $ 4,385 for single employees .
•
Employers did not substantially raise deductibles , premiums or co-payments that their employees pay .
The average percentage of the premium paid by workers was 27 % for family coverage and 16 % for single plans .
Still , workers are paying more because overall premiums rose .
" Working people are still feeling the pain , " says Altman , who says on average , what workers pay toward premiums has risen 84 % since 2000 , while wages are up 20 % and inflation 18 % .
The total premium increase is up 87 % since 2000 .
While high - deductible policies have always been sold , the new twist in the market came when Congress in late 2003 allowed certain policies to be coupled with tax - free " health savings accounts . "
Money in these accounts not used for deductibles and other medical care can roll over and be used in future years for medical care .
That 's a change from the flexible spending accounts many companies offer .
Proponents , including President Bush , say the policies will get patients to act more like savvy consumers and shop for medical care based on cost and quality .
Critics , including the Commonwealth Fund , say such policies benefit mainly the healthy and wealthy and will discourage preventive medical care .
The policies have annual deductibles of at least $ 1,050 for singles and $ 2,100 for families .
Another type of account , a health reimbursement account , is similar , except the worker generally cannot take any money left in the account with him or her when leaving the company .
The Kaiser survey found that the average annual deductible for the reimbursement accounts is $ 1,442 for individuals or $ 2,985 for families .
For health savings account plans offered by employers , the average annual deductible was $ 2,011 for singles and $ 4,008 for families .
Sixty three percent of employers contribute something toward the savings accounts .
While high - deductible accounts have lower premiums than other types of insurance , the Kaiser survey found that most employers do n't save any money compared with other types of insurance , once employer contributions to those savings accounts are added to premium costs .
Asset Resources , a 10 - employee debt collection firm in Minneapolis , switched to a high - deductible plan after several years of 17 % increases in health insurance premiums .
" The broker said we might be able to cut some costs for you and afford some employees an opportunity from a tax point of view , " says Mark Wallerius , vice president .
" It seemed a win - win at the time . "
So the company switched from insurance with a $ 500 annual deductible , a $ 15 co-pay at the doctor 's office and a 20 % coinsurance charge for hospital services to one with an annual deductible of $ 1,250 .
Some preventive care is fully covered at the doctor 's office , but employees had to pay the full cost of other visits until they reached the deductible .
" They were pretty disgruntled , " says Wallerius , who said the employees voted to go back to a lower - deductible plan this year .

I 've read Soros ' work .
I think things definitely would change if he owned CNN .
But it 's all speculation , is n't it ?
On the Zogby polls ( which I am happy to say I am a Progressive / Very liberal participant in ) if the Democrats do n't use this to push for impeachment hearings , it is yet another reason to clean our Congress of ineffectual panderers in '06 .
For anyone in Washington state , Mark Wilson is running against Maria Cantwell in here incumbent bid .
Wilson ( www.votemark.com) is ex-military and a member of Veterans for Peace .
I wish he was running as a Green , but in retrospect if he gets a lot of support from Democrats it will send a message to senators like Cantwell , who has repeatedly voted for war funding and against election investigation , that enough is enough .
If you are elected a Democrat , then act like and vote like one .
No more of this Lieberman bullshit .
It is likely that the GOP challenger will be Dino Rossi , the guy who lost out to Christine Gregoire in some questionable election bungling .
It is likely that the outcome of the governor 's race in '04 will have implications in Cantwell 's ' 06 campaign because a lot of folks here in WA think that Rossi got screwed and may be more likely to support him .
So Maria 's in the hot seat , and her push against ANWR legislation was good , but IMHO not good enough to make up for the crap that she has voted for .
Of course , Rossi is a punk and wo n't do anything good for our state , but it may send a message to Democrat incumbents in other states that they need to stand on the principles for which they were elected .
So bring on the hearings , Democrats , else you are worthless as the day is long !

I thought Soros ( safely ) swore that if he could be 100 % guaranteed of getting rid of * , he would give away every cent of his fortune .
What about his foundation ?
Nobody means that Soros ought to buy it to make money , but rather as one of his philanthropic pursuits .
No question Soros will push the wall to get * and Cheney impeached , but maybe I 'm dreamin ' to think he'd buy a mainstream tv network .
Seems to me what 's left of Big Labor could help get enough people behind forcing MSM and government on this subject , right away , by shutting down tons of businesses .
You get a big enough sector taking overt action in protest , and exponentially more overcome their reticence and join them .
Even though , it seems , Gore 's not going to stump for impeachment tomorrow , I 'm still thinking of it as the starting gun for the masses indicated in the Zogby to make themselves unmistakably SEEN .

Illegally spying on American citizens warrants impeachment proceedings .
However , the outing of a CIA operative , the uncaring incompetent handling of the victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita , misleading the Congress and the American people regarding the war in Iraq , the failure to capture Bin Laden , tax cuts to the rich and gutting programs to help the poor and elderly are all reasons to unseat this president .
The scandals of this Administration are too numerous to keep up with --- and all largely ignored by the mainstream media .
Bush has sealed his records for good reason .
The records need to be unsealed and he and Cheney must be held accountable for their high crimes and misdemeanors .
Tragically , it seems hopeless to expect that the republican - controlled House and Senate will seriously investigate anything the Bush Administration does .
With Alito soon taking a seat on the Supreme Court , the future of our democracy looks bleak and dark .

The problem with impeachment with Bush is not the concept nor the mechanism for doing it .
It is the majority in congress .
The house has to do the impeachment , and the senate follow up with conviction .
In the case of Clinton , the first part was done , but it failed in the senate .
There was no conviction .
As we stand today , there is no way this congress would impeach .
No way .
They will have to take a hit in November , get voted out , then the new congress with a different majority can be expected to consider the matter seriously .

Joan # 26 The House is the center of corruption right now .
The Senate is where Specter is conducting the hearings .
He laughed when the idea of impeachment came up and only discussed impeachment in the abstract .
I would like to be wrong on this issue , however , politics will fashion the debate .
And since corruption is the driving factor , cover ups and avoidances and ignoring will carry the day .
A good beating of the majority republican party at the polls in November will change all of that .
Nothing else will .

I think they 'll keep an eye on the polls , and on the e-mails from constituents .
If it does n't get any worse from here , there will be no impeachment attempt before November .
But if that 52 % number gets up around 60 % or higher , and Bush 's approval number gets down around 30 % ( it 's already back down to 39 % ) , then it would n't surprise me to see a gutsy Republican take the lead ... just to " explore " the question , of course .
I can see the strategy now , orchestrated by Rove with Bush 's approval .
Someone like Specter , with a legalistic manner , comes forward before the election with the explanation that " The Constitutional questions are too important not to examine them closely . "
Hearings are held , but key information can't be divulged else we 'll " warn the terrorists of what we 're doing . "
In the absence of convincing proof that Bush broke the law , no action is taken .
Republicans claim credit for taking up the issue , then take their " forward - looking " agenda to the electorate in November .

One problem with impeachment is that Congress passed the USA" PATRIOT "
Act overwhelmingly - an act which requires judges to issue warrants on phone taps and other surveillance when part of an ongoing criminal investigation ( which could be anything . )
And there are so many other dangerous , sham , and , frankly , treasonous elements to the " PATRIOT "
Act that I 'm sure they will be brought up as " we all knew the danger of terrorism . "
Not that I think impeachment should n't be pushed .
The above is just a comment on the issue .
I believe we have a responsibility as citizens to impeach the president and others for " treason , high crimes and misdemeanors " and that it is very important that the subject of impeachment snowball in the next few months up to the elections .
I was n't able to see Al Gore 's speech , but I understand he called for repeal of the " PATRIOT " Act ?
Is this true ?
If so , it 's a milestone - and something else that has to be followed up on in various ways .

A matter that was never mentioned during the entire confirmation hearing : On January 16 , 1984 Assistant Solicitor General Samuel Alito argued in " FCC v. League of Women Voters " that there should be a ban on editorializing on public air waves ( radio & television ) .
He lost the case and Justice Brennan wrote the decision : that it was unconstitutional ( First Amendment Right ) to ban free speech on public broadcasting .
Time is provided for counter arguments and there is no reason to ban editorializing on public broadcasting .
Therefore , we can say truthfully that Samuel Alito opposed " Free Speech " which is protected by the U. S. Constitution .
That ALONE should be reason enough to block his confirmation .
He argued that commercial broadcasting , however , has every right to editorialize .
Conclusion : another corporate shill being considered for the SCotUS .

I need to learn how to make links , but you can copy and paste this url to get to the Transition 2001 NSA report that does not constitute proof of any criminal activity , or even the desire to act criminally .
It acknowledges that its recommendations would require changing legislation to accommodate its use .
I guess there are witnesses / whistleblowers who can testify that the capabilities alluded to in this report almost immediately were put into play , without lawful authority , but this document does not constitute proof of any wrongdoing , or intent to do wrong .

Whether congress can deal with Bushco 's usurpation of our Constitution remains to be seen .
Given Rethuglican control of the House of Unrepentant and the Seenot it is doubtful .
I therefore have an idea for you :
We know that the NSA is conducting an illegal operation to spy on Americans using sophisticated " recognition " software to lock onto calls or emails containing certain key words .
Data mining .
The only way any citizen can combat an illegal program such as this is by civil disobedience , SO IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF ALL AMERICANS , COUNTRY - WIDE , BEGAN USING TRIGGER WORDS IN EVERY TELEPHONE CALL THEY MAKE OR RECEIVE ?
The system would soon be overwhelmed by far too many " hits " for them all ( or perhaps ANY ) of them to be further investigated , potentially destroying the usefulness of the illegal program .
So what if every liberal blog , or any others believing Bushco has gone too far , asked ALL THE VISITORS to their site to include certain trigger words IN EVERY CONVERSATION THEY HAVE WITH ANYONE .
You know , words like : Osama bin Laden , jihad , dirty bomb , nuclear material , anthrax , chemical weapons , Zarqawi , Allah akbar , infidels , Iran mullahs , and everything else the readers could come up with .
Perhaps even run a contest for your readers to add to the probable list that would " flag " their number for further investigation .
The sheer numbers , if we could pull this off , would render it impossible or impractical for the program to continue .
I am sick of our Imperial President and his constant violations of the law and the erosion of my civil rights .
It is time , in my opinion , to demonstrate to Bushco that this IS a government by , for , and of the People .
This could perhaps be engineered into the greatest single act of civil disobedience in history .
What do you think ?
Do we stand by and gripe , or do we take action ?

Less than one hour ago , Softbank Mobile ‘s charistmatic CEO , Masayoshi Son , just completed an unexpected ( 予想外 ) press conference at the New Ohtani .
Just as stippy.com reported last week , Mobile Number Portability ( MNP ) is starting this week in Japan and promises to upset the comfortable duopoly of DoCoMo and Au .
Stippy.com recevied a lot of email from readers suggesting that MNP would be a non-event , but it appears as though that is not the case .
Son-san wants to join these two giants in the big technological sand pit they call success .
Following on from his amusing 予想外 TV commercial series featured last week , Son-san has made an even more unexpected announcement today .
Anyone who signs up for Softbank ’s new “ Gold Plan ” will be entitled to a Yosogaiwari ( 予想外割 ) :
Free email ,
Free SMS ,
Free voice to other Softbank subscribers …
and as an extra teaser the first two months are completely free ( including the monthly fee ) .
Good - bye to hard to understand teigaku ( fixed price ) plans , the only thing that you will have to pay for are calls to non-Softbank subscribers and access to internet sites .
Better yet , the entire package will only cost you 2,880 yen per month .
Given that the average person spends about 7,000 yen per month on their phone bill , that could save you about 50,000 yen a year .
( Multiply that by a family of four !! )
So , you say ( As I would expect any cynical reader of stippy.com to ask ) , what is the fine print ?
Son mentioned in the press conference that this deal is only available until January 15 , 2007 .
Interestingly , Son claims that everyone who signs up between now and Jan 15 is entitled to the 2,880 yen / month plan for ever ( this guy is serious ) .
Clearly the other “ catches ” have to do with what is not free .
Son did n’t go into details about the pricing of calls to other carriers or the packet charge rate for accessing the internet , but absent of a large hidden price rise , this should be cheap too ( Softbank is well known to be the cheapest carrier in Japan ) .
Furthermore , Son made it very clear that it is his intention to win both the battle and the war .
If either DoCoMo or Au announce reactory price cuts , he ’s promised to respond with a similar package – only 200 yen per month cheaper – within 24 hours .
The only potential “ catch ” that we could think of was to do with area coverage / bandwidth .
After Willcom introduced unlimited free calls and email between Willcom users , their network suffered serious capacity issues and had to rapidly speed up their infrastructure expansion plans .
No doubt Softbank will suffer the same problem .
Son has promised to double Softbank ’s area coverage ( number of base stations ) by next March which should help stem some of the increased usage , but who knows if he will complete it in time ?
Eyes and ears are now focused on Au and DoCoMo to see how they will react to such a move .
Son made it very clear in his presentation tonight that he had no intention of letting DoCoMo and Au continue to earn their monopoly profits .
( Remember these companies made a total of 15 billion US dollars of profit between them last year !!)
And so , may the games begin !
That one place where your RSS list is created is called an RSS Reader , and it gathers all the headlines from all the websites and blogs you have subscribed to .
In a moment , I will describe how to get an RSS Reader .
Suppose you have 50 sites and blogs that you like to visit regularly .
Going to visit each website and blog everyday could take you hours .
With RSS , you can “ subscribe ” to a website or blog , and get “ fed ” all the new headlines from all of these 50 sites and blogs in one list , and see what ’s going on in minutes instead of hours .
What a time saver !
So , to make RSS much easier to understand , in Oprah speak , RSS stands for : I ’m “ Ready for Some Stories ” .
It is a way online for you to get a quick list of the latest story headlines from all your favorite websites and blogs all in one place .
How cool is that ?
( Click on image for larger view )
The Oprah definition
The technical acronym for RSS is “ Really Simple Syndication ” , an XML format that was created to syndicate news , and be a means to share content on the web .
Now , to geeks and techies that means something special , but to everyday folks like you and me , what comes to mind is , “ Uh , I do n’t get it ? ”
We all have busy lives with very little time .
Web surfing is fun but can take hours going to visit every single website and blog you enjoy .
Would n’t it be fabulous if you could just get all the headlines of the most current stories from all your favorite websites and blogs in one place ?
Subscribing to RSS feeds
But first , to “ subscribe ” to a website or blog ’s RSS feed simply means that you are telling that website or blog , “ Yes please .
Send me your story headlines . ”
It ’s like subscribing to a magazine or newsletter .
Instead of getting a magazine or email , you will just get a list of headlines sent to your RSS reader .
If the headline looks interesting to you , all you have to do is click on the headline and you ’ll be sent to the whole story .
In order to subscribe to a website or blog ’s RSS , all you have to do is click on an RSS symbol like one of those shown in the diagram above , or a text link of the words “ Subscribe to our RSS feed ” on the website or blog .
Typically , you can find these RSS symbols or text links in your browser window , on the sides of the website page , or on the bottom of the page .
The publishers of the websites and blogs really want people to subscribe to their RSS , so they will make it very easy for you to find the subscription links .
RSS Readers
Now , because nothing is ever standard on the web like dealing with different operating systems , Mac vs. PC , and different flavored browsers like Internet Explorer , AOL , Safari , and Firefox , the way to get an RSS reader will be dependent on what browser you like to use , and how accessible you ’d like your RSS list ( s ) to be .
Just like there are flavors of web browsers , you may see and hear of different flavors of RSS XML feeders like RSS 1.0 , RSS 2.0 , and Atom .
Again , the flavors are only important if you want to get techie .
If you stick to looking for an RSS symbol like I have shown you in the diagram , you will be just fine .
If you ’d like your RSS list to be accessible from any computer or mobile device you may have like a PDA , laptop , or cell phone , some popular RSS readers include ( and almost all are FREE ) :
MyYahoo
MyMSN
MyAOL
MyGoogle
Bloglines
FeedDemon ( this one costs money )
NewsGator ( there is a cost for mobile accessibility )
NetVibes
PageFlakes
Shrook ( For Mac users .
Free trial and then there 's a cost . )
Lektora
Attensa ( more for enterprise , and there 's a cost )
Update :
If there are any other good RSS readers I 've missed , please let me know and I will add them .
As you can see , there are a plethora of choices for you .
All are good RSS readers , so your choice will simply come down to the style that appeals most to you .
RSS as Live Bookmarks
Browsers like Safari and Firefox allow you to subscribe to RSS feeds through the browser , and it ’s called “ live bookmarking ” .
Currently , you can only do live bookmarking in Internet Explorer if you have IE7 which is still in Beta .
Oprah translation : Non-geeks cannot do live bookmarking in Internet Explorer because it ’s not done yet .
The limitation with using RSS in live bookmark form is that you only have access to your RSS list from the computer you created the bookmarks on .
If you want the flexibility of complete accessibility , then I recommend going the RSS Reader route .
Here ’s an example of an RSS live bookmark feed for the celebrity gossip site TMZ.com using the Firefox browser on a PC .
Here ’s an example of RSS live bookmark feed for the Yahoo Entertainment Celebrity page using the Mac Safari browser .
So there you have it .
Are you now Ready for Some Stories ?
Enjoy !

A Casualty of Globalization Death of the Unions
It used to be that industry could do little without first getting the support of the unions .
With the globalization of the labor market though , unions have lost their power -- and many of their members .
Organized labor is on life support .
Von Gabor Steingart
For three billion years , life on earth consisted of single - celled organisms like bacteria or algae .
Only 600 million years ago did evolution hit on a system for making multicellular organisms like animals and plants .
The key to the system is to give the cells that make up an organism a variety of different identities so that they can perform many different roles .
So even though all the cells carry the same genome , each type of cell must be granted access to only a few of the genes in the genome , with all the others permanently denied to it .
People , for instance , have at least 260 different types of cells , each specialized for a different tissue or organ , but presumably each type can activate only some of the 22,500 genes in the human genome .

今から20年ほど前，筆者が某大学の工学部に在籍していたとき，同学年に1000人ほどの学生がいました。しかし，私も含め女性はわずか8人でした。現在は1100人くらいに定員が増えていますが，そのうち80人くらいが女性だそうで，とても頼もしく思います。
けれども，IT業界で働く女性技術者がどんどん増えているという実感はありません。国際的に見ても，日本は相変わらず科学技術分野で働く女性の数はとても少ないようです。『男女共同参画白書
平成17年版』によれば，日本の研究者（技術者，大学教授など）に占める女性の割合は11.6％（図1）。欧米先進国と比較すると，アメリカの32.5％，フランスの27.5％，イギリスの26.0％，ドイツの15.5％よりも低い数字です（図2）。
企業に所属する女性技術者となると，さらに比率は下がります。大学等（短期大学，高等専門学校を含む）に所属する女性技術者は5万8000人いるのに対し，企業には3万3000人しか所属しておらず，全体に占める女性の割合はわずか6.6％にとどまります。
経済協力開発機構（OECD）が実施した学習到達度調査によると，日本の高校生の理科と数学の学習能力で男女間に有意の差は認められなかったといいます。にも関わらず，進学や職業を選ぶ段階で，女子生徒は理工系分野を選択する割合がOECD諸国の中で最も低い。要するに，日本の女性は理工系の職場に魅力を感じていないということでしょう。
女性技術者は大学に帰れ？
科学技術立国を標榜する日本の現状がこれでは，国際的な体面からしても，競争力の面からしてもよろしくない，というわけで，政府は様々な施策を打ち始めています。女性のライフスタイルに合わせ，「1.進学」「2.就職（採用）」「3.育成（スキルアップ）」「4.仕事と子育ての両立」というフェーズごとに施策を立て，女性の技術職場での活躍を支援しようというわけです。
まず「1.進学」。内閣府男女共同参画局は昨年，女子学生向けに理工系の大学や職業を紹介するWebサイト「 Challenge Campaign」を開設しました。ここでは，北海道大学の女子学生が道内各地を回って女子中高生と一緒に実験したり対話したりする「理系進学応援キャラバン」や，中央大学大学院理工学研究科がリコーなど4社の女性技術者を招いて講演してもらい，女子大生の理系就職を促すキャリアアップセミナーなどの情報が紹介されています。
「 3.育成（スキルアップ） 」と「4.仕事と子育ての両立」については，文部科学省が今年度から，非常勤研究員や任期付きポストドクターなど，出産・育児で研究を中断した研究者の復帰を支援するための特別研究員制度を設けました。博士の学位取得者もしくはそれに相当する能力のある人が対象で，大学院の研究室などを拠点に研究活動を行う場合，奨励金として月額36万4000円が支給されるほか，研究費が交付されます（2年間）。平成18年度は30人が採用され，来年度も新たに同数の採用を計画しています。
また，文部科学省は，女性研究者の子育て支援で優れた取り組みを行った大学，国立の研究機関を対象に，2000万円～5000万円を支援するモデル育成事業を始めました（予算総額5億円）。今年度はお茶の水女子大学，東京女子医科大学，京都大学など10機関が選ばれており，地域の女性教員懇話会や子育てグループ，同窓会を活用した保育やワークシェアなどの取り組みを支援しています。
こうした国の施策は大学や国立の研究機関が対象で，企業の現状が改善されるわけではありません。企業に女性の活用を促すものとしては，2000年12月に閣議決定された男女共同参画基本計画における積極的改善措置（ポジティブ・アクション）があります。これは，企業内に男女の参画機会に格差があるときに，女性の積極活用を自主的に進めよというもので，自治体などのように数値目標と実施を義務付けるものではありません。
企業の “ 自主的な取り組み ” は進んでいる か
実際に松下電器産業は，2001年に「女性かがやき本部（現在は多様性推進本部）」を設置。女性の管理職を増やすために数値目標を設定して，計画的な登用と育成を実施しています。日本IBMは，「1998年に女性の管理職比率が全世界のIBMの中で最下位だった」（同社技術理事の菅原香代子氏）ことから，全社を挙げて女性活用に取り組みました。女子学生を対象としたワークショップや女性幹部候補生を対象としたセミナーを開いて女性の採用や育成に力を注ぎ，同時に女性社員の子育て支援のためにフレックスタイムやe-ワーク（在宅勤務）などの制度を導入。この結果，5年間で女性の管理職比率は目標に大きく近付きました。
しかし，こうした取り組みがIT業界の隅々にまで行き渡っているとは言えないのが現状です。数百人の女性技術者で構成する日本女性技術者フォーラム（JWEF）は昨年，『女性技術者
就労環境とキャリア形成』という調査報告書をまとめました。これを見ると，いくら会社に仕事と家庭の両立を支援する制度や仕組みがあっても，結局はそれを運用する組織や人，直接的には職場の上司によって，女性が働き続けられるかどうかが決まってしまうという現実がよくわかります。
大手電機メーカーを退職し，現在は大学院の博士課程で学ぶある女性技術者は，調査報告書に収録された座談会の中で次のように語っています。
「6時15分に職場を走って出ないと間に合わないというときに，職場の人に『そんなに急いで帰ってどうするんだ。子供なんか別に放っぽり出されるわけじゃないだろう。保育園に10分15分遅れたって，良心があるから見てるだろう。子供の顔をそんなに早く見たいのか』と言われて，もう何を話してもむだだなと思いました」
これは特別なことではないでしょう。筆者も12年前，0歳児を保育園に迎えに行くのに6時に会社を出ようとしたら，当時の編集長に突然「6時半からの会議に出ろ」と言われて途方に暮れたことがあります。
毎日定時退社することに対して後ろめたさを感じ，一方で保育士に遅刻して迷惑をかけられないというプレッシャーから，必要がなくても走ってしまうのが母親の心理です。これが毎日，毎日，長い人は10年以上も続きます。この現実を理解できていたら，このような言葉が口から出ることはないでしょう。
出生率はずっと下がり続ける
子育てや家庭問題を抱える女性に対して，会社が本当になすべきことは，見かけだけ立派な制度を作ったり，女性活用を測る数値目標をいたずらに吊り上げることではありません。
まず，経営トップが，社員が子供を産み育てやすい環境を作るんだと，本気になることです。その意識が現場に伝わり，職場の意識が高まれば，一致協力して支援していく環境が生まれます。制度に魂を入れると言いますが，職場の意識変革なくしては，出産を機に退職する女性は減ることはない。真の意味での女性活用にはならないのです。
国が子育て支援の法制度を整えても，運用がうまくいっていない証左としては，いっこうに向上しない日本の出生率を見てもわかります。日本は1970年から2000年までの30年間，働く女性の比率はさして増えていないのに，出生率は下がり続けています。
しかし，世界の趨勢（すうせい）は違います。OECD24カ国（1人当たりGDP1万ドル以上）のデータによると，1970年時点では，女性の労働力率の高い国ほど出生率が低いという傾向にありました。それが30年後の2000年では，女性の労働力率が高い国ほど，出生率が高い。つまり，多くの女性が働く国ほど，多くの子供が産まれているのです。
これは30年の間に多くの先進国が，子育てと仕事の両立が可能な社会環境を整えることに努め，成果を上げていることにほかなりません。図3は主要先進国の年齢階級別の女性労働力率，図4は日本とオランダ，ノルウェー，アメリカの4カ国で，女性の労働力率と出生率を比較したものです。70年には，アメリカやノルウェーよりも，日本の女性の方が多く働いていました。しかし今や，アメリカやノルウェーは日本よりも女性の働く比率が高く，しかも80年代半ば以降，出生率も回復してきています。日本だけが取り残されている状況なのです。
IT業界は日本の課題が端的に現れている社会と言えます。子育て中の女性をタブー視する風潮を一掃しない限り，今後も出生率は下がり続けるでしょう。男性も含めた「働き方の柔軟性」や「多様なライフスタイル」を受け入れる徹底した意識変革を行い，それらを実現する職場環境を作っていくことが求められています。

Iran insists its nuclear programme is purely peaceful
Iran had suggested it might be allowed to enrich small quantities of uranium for research purposes while importing most of its nuclear fuel from Russia .
However , the US opposes allowing Iran to enrich any uranium .
Speaking in Washington , Russia 's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also rejected a deal .
Mr Lavrov said Moscow 's proposal for Iran to enrich uranium on Russian territory depended on Iran 's full compliance with the requirements of the UN nuclear agency .
The International Atomic Energy Agency wants Iran to suspend uranium enrichment altogether .
Its board is currently meeting in Vienna to consider Iran 's case .
It voted last month to report Iran to the UN Security Council for failing to disclose details of its nuclear activities .
' Proliferation risk '
Last week , Tehran suggested a compromise deal in which it would be allowed to enrich a small amount of uranium for research purposes , in return for accepting the Russian proposal .
However , US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the only deal she backed was the original Russian proposal .
There is no compromise to the Russian proposal
Sergei Lavrov
Russian foreign minister
Iran 's diplomatic escalator
" This is not an issue of Iran 's right to civil nuclear power , it is that there needs to be a way to provide for civil nuclear power that does not have a proliferation risk , " she said after talks with Mr Lavrov .
Mr Lavrov said there was " no compromise " to the Russian proposal .
Western powers believe Iran wants to develop nuclear arms , a claim it denies .
Tehran insists it has the right to develop its nuclear sector to produce energy for civilian purposes .
Three years of negotiations between Iran and the EU have brought no significant result , and Iran resumed enrichment in January after a two - year hiatus .
Compensation appeal
Earlier , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said the West should compensate Iran for its suspension of nuclear research , as a way of building trust .
However , he failed to mention that Iran 's suspension of uranium enrichment two years ago - the basis of his call for compensation - had been voluntary , the BBC's Frances Harrison reports from Tehran .
A senior military commander warned on Monday that the Iranian military would turn the country into a killing field for any enemy aggressor .
There is now more talk from Iranian officials of preparing people psychologically for confrontation with the West , our correspondent says .
But Iranian television has accused Western media of exaggerating the dispute over Iran 's nuclear ambitions , our correspondent says .
Stepping up its probe of allegedly improper campaigning by churches , the Internal Revenue Service on Friday ordered a liberal Pasadena parish to turn over all the documents and e-mails it produced during the 2004 election year with references to political candidates .
All Saints Episcopal Church and its rector , the Rev. Ed Bacon , have until Sept. 29 to present the sermons , newsletters and electronic communications .
The IRS investigation was triggered by an antiwar sermon delivered by its former rector , the Rev. George F. Regas , at the church two days before the 2004 presidential election .
The summons even requests utility bills to establish costs associated with hosting Regas ’ speech .
Bacon was ordered to testify before IRS officials Oct. 11 .
The tax code bars nonprofits , including churches , from endorsing or campaigning against candidates in an election .

Facing the possible loss of his church ’s tax - exempt status , Bacon said he plans to inform his roughly 3,500 active congregants about the investigation during Sunday ’s services .
Then he plans to seek their advice on whether to comply .
“ There is a lot at stake here , ” Bacon said in an interview .
“ If the IRS prevails , it will have a chilling effect on the practice of religion in America . ”
The congregants will have two choices : consent to the IRS request , or decline , which could result in the matter being referred to the Department of Justice and , possibly , U.S. District Court in Los Angeles , All Saints ’ lead attorney Marcus Owens said .
“ The congregation ’s decision will be clear on Sunday or a few days after that , ” Owens said .
“ My guess is they will be unlikely to respond demurely and acquiesce in the government ’s request at this stage .
The issues are too close to the quick of their fundamental religious beliefs . ”
Advertisement
Members of All Saints have a long history of social activism .
The sermon that attracted the IRS ’ attention was delivered by Regas , who was well - known for opposing the Vietnam War , championing female clergy and supporting gays and lesbians in the church .
The medieval - looking church , just east of City Hall , seems to embody staid , moneyed Old Pasadena , but the liberal outlook goes back decades .
During World War II , its rector spoke out against the internment of Japanese Americans .
Regas headed the church for 28 years before retiring in 1995 .
Exactly how the congregants will make their feelings known on the IRS issue is yet to be decided .
“ It may come via e-mail , or as a yea or nay on Sunday , or some other means , ” said Keith Holeman , a spokesman for the church .

IRS spokesman Frank Fotinatos declined to comment on the matter saying , “ We ca n’t confirm or deny any ongoing investigation . ”
Rep. Adam B. Schiff ( D - Burbank ) , who unsuccessfully tried to launch a Government Accountability Office investigation into the IRS ’ probes of churches nationwide last year , called the summons “ a very disturbing escalation ” of the agency ’s scrutiny of All Saints .
“ I do n’t want religious organizations to become arms of campaigns , ” he said .
“ But they should be able to talk about issues of war and peace without fear of losing tax - exempt status .
If they can ’t , they ’ll have little to say from the pulpit . ”
The view was echoed by the Rev. Bob Edgar , an ordained elder in the United Methodist Church and general secretary of the National Council of Churches USA .
“ I ’m outraged , ” he said .
“ Preachers ought to have the liberty to speak truth to power . ”

“ There is a lot more to be done about this , and it may include some actions of nonviolent civil disobedience , ” Edgar said .
“ Since 9/11 , the IRS , like the FBI , has been moving back to the 1950s and 1960s when a great deal of such activity was propagated against church leaders like Martin Luther King . ”
In July , the IRS warned 15,000 tax - exempt groups across the nation , including churches and nonprofit organizations , to stay neutral on politics .
At the time , IRS officials said the agency also began expediting investigations into charges of improper campaigning under a new enforcement program , the Political Activity Compliance Initiative .
Under it , the IRS will no longer wait for an annual tax return to be filed or for the tax year to end before investigating allegations of wrongful campaigning .
Since 2004 , the IRS has investigated more than 200 organizations nationwide .
Advertisement
Federal law prohibits the IRS from releasing the names of those under investigation , but the agency in July said it had 100 cases pending -- 40 of them churches .
Among them is the agency ’s case against the NAACP , which drew the IRS ’ attention in July 2004 , after the organization ’s chairman , Julian Bond , criticized the Bush administration ’s policies on civil rights .
All Saints came under IRS investigation shortly after Regas delivered a guest sermon that depicted Jesus in a mock debate with then - presidential candidates George W. Bush and John F. Kerry .
The sermon , which did not endorse or oppose any of the candidates , addressed the moral and religious implications of various social issues facing the nation at the time .
Advertisement
Regas ’ suggestion that Jesus would have told Bush his preemptive war strategy in Iraq “ has led to disaster ” prompted a letter from the agency in June 2005 stating that “ a reasonable belief exists that you may not be a tax - exempt church . ”
After nearly a year without communication with the agency , Bacon said he was “ quite surprised ” Friday when an IRS agent handed him the summons at his church .
In addition to seeking electronic communications , the summons requests “ a copy of all oral communications identifying candidates for public office delivered at All Saints Church or at events sponsored by All Saints Church between Jan. 1 , 2004 , and Nov. 2 , 2004 . ”
The summons also asks for various financial records .
“ Please provide an accounting of all expenditures associated with delivery of the sermon , including allocations of overhead . ”
All Saints officials take that to mean such things as the pay of church staff .
Advertisement
Bacon said the IRS ’ renewed investigation raises concerns that it may reflect an attempt to quash the church ’s discussions of “ fundamental religious issues with policy implications before the midterm elections , and in a way that intrudes into core religious practices . ”
“ Despite the drain on our finances and the time we will spend defending this attack on the freedoms of religion and speech , All Saints Church will continue without interruption or fear what has distinguished its mission for 125 years , ” Bacon said .

The Digital Journalist presents a selection from the 100 Photographs That Changed the World
A MultimediaProduction By
Photographs and Text

Editor : Robert Sullivan
Picture Editor : Barbara Baker Burrows
The Premise Behind These Pictures Photographs and History � Images That Interpret Our Past
by Patrick Cox , Ph.D
Let us first pose a question :
Is it folly to nominate 100 photographs as having been influential to world events , or is this a valid historic inquiry ?
LIFE will , here and in the following pages , put forth its argument .
You be the judge .
Having been in the business of presenting stirring , revelatory photography since 1936 , LIFE has a vested interest in claiming for photojournalism a place of high importance .
Given its preferences and an endless page count , LIFE would put forth a thousand and more photos of substance , each of them worth at least a thousand words .
Words .
Ever since chisel was taken to slate , it has been accepted that words can and do change the world .
Whether it be the Torah , the New Testament or the Koran , the Magna Carta or the Declaration of Independence , J’Accuse , Oliver Twist or Catch - 22 , Common Sense or Silent Spring , the effect of words can reach so many hearts and minds that it impacts the human condition and the course of mankind .
Speeches incite , editorials persuade , poems inspire .
Can photographs perform similarly ?
For several weeks in the spring of 2003 , LIFE solicited an - swers to that question on its own Web site ( www.LIFE.com) and that of the highly regarded Digital Journalist ( www.digitaljournalist.org), an online publication affiliated with the University of Texas .
We received many opinions , most of which supported our conceit that a photo could change the world — music to our ears — along with one detailed , intelligent rebuttal .
“ I really do not believe that photographs actually change anything , least of all the ‘ World , ’ ” wrote Joshua Haruni .
“ To suggest that photographs , like the written word , have had a profound effect on our lives is simply wrong .
Just imagine suggesting that Picture Post or Time or LIFE had as much impact on our lives as Das Kapital , Mein Kampf or the Bible . . .
Photographs can be very beautiful , informative , ugly or anything else the photographer chooses to show .
Photographs can definitely inspire us , but the written word has the ability to spark the imagination to greater depths than any photograph , whose content is limited to what exists in the frame . ”
Mr. Haruni is , by the way , a documentary photographer .
His argument forced us to once again confront our premise .
We compared Mr. Haruni ’s thoughts and those of other respondents and finally determined : A collection of pictures that “ changed the world ” is a thing worth contemplating , if only to arrive at some resolution about the influential nature of photography and whether it is limited , vast or in between .
We do not claim that LIFE ’s 100 are the 100 or the top 100 , but that they , and the other related landmark images presented here , argue on behalf of the power of pictures .
Not every iconic image will be found here .
Many nominated the 1937 crash of the Hindenburg .
We looked hard at the picture , the event and the aftermath , and decided against .
We may be remiss about the Hindenburg , and we may be wrong about excluding our friend Alfred Eisenstaedt ’s picture of the sailor kissing the nurse in Times Square .
Some of you will , no doubt , be disappointed by some choices and omissions .
But many who answered our query will be pleased to see their passions shared .
“ The lone Chinese demonstrator as he stops a column of advancing tanks in Beijing was a person of steel , ” wrote Maek Lester S. Cayabyab , a journalism student in Manila .
Jacob Meade , a “ photo fan ” from Amherst , N.H. , wo n’t find his Hindenburg , but he offered a compelling argument for “ the portrait of Anne Frank :
The poignancy of her gaze haunts the world to this day , pointing up the horror of Hitler ’s genocide and making us wonder how many brilliant young women such as herself were lost . ”
We took all nominations seriously , added our own , and then solicited the advice of some old LIFE hands .
Renowned photographers such as John Loengard and Gordon Parks , who writes the evocative introduction immediately following , contributed their expertise .
And then , just before we closed the book on this book , an E- mail came from Gary and Anita Fender of Celina , Ten. , that put the project in perspective .
Attached was a photo of their infant grandson , Caden Zane Brown , born March 16 , 2003 .
“ He ’s changed our world , ” the Fenders wrote , implying a truth that underlies every picture in these pages .
It is , in the end , a personal relationship between viewer and image .
The power of a picture is in the mind of the beholder .

Contributing : Source : USA TODAY analysis of data from the Alan Guttmacher Institute STATES COMPARED STATES COMPARED THE 'ROE ' RULING THE 'ROE ' RULING The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade in 1973 that a Texas law criminalizing most abortions violated a woman 's constitutional right of privacy , which the court said was implicit in the due- process clause of the 14th Amendment .
" Jane Roe " was an alias used to shield the identity of Norma McCorvey , who sued Dallas County District Attorney Henry Wade .
In the 7 - 2 decision , the court sought to balance a woman 's right to privacy with a state 's interest in regulating abortion .
Only a " compelling state interest " would justify restrictions , it concluded .
Legal challenges have limited the reach of Roe but not overturned it .
' Roe v. Wade ' :
The divided states of America COLUMBUS , Ohio  Two hours after South Dakota Gov. Mike Rounds signed an abortion ban last month , NARAL Pro-Choice America blasted an e-mail to its supporters : " Is your state next ? "
The South Dakota legislation and the abortion rights group 's warning are early skirmishes in a battle over what states would do if the landmark Roe v.
Wade decision were overturned — though both sides concede that may never happen .
If it does , a fight that for three decades has focused on nine members of the Supreme Court would be waged instead among more than 7,000 legislators in 50 state capitals .
" Now is the time to get moving on this in Ohio , " says Tom Brinkman , a state legislator who has introduced a bill to ban almost all abortions .
Meanwhile , Kellie Copeland of NARAL Pro-Choice
Ohio is braced .
" Our supporters feel the fight is coming back to the states , " she says .
What would states do ?
Ultimately , that would depend on factors ranging from who was governor to where public opinion stood .
Even so , there are clues from what state legislatures have chosen to do already and what they 're considering doing next .
For instance , four states have passed " trigger " bans on abortion that would go into effect immediately if Roe were reversed .
Six other states have passed laws that would automatically protect access to abortion .
Three states have enacted all 11 of the current restrictions on abortion tracked by the non-profit Alan Guttmacher Institute , from requiring waiting periods to limiting abortion coverage in insurance plans .
One state , Vermont , has n't passed any restriction .
USA TODAY used the Guttmacher data and other factors to calculate how states would be likely to respond if Roe were reversed .
The 1973 decision recognized access to abortion as part of a constitutional right to privacy and limited states ' ability to restrict it .
The conclusions : • Twenty - two state legislatures are likely to impose significant new restrictions on abortion .
They include nearly every state in the South and a swath of big states across the industrial Rust Belt , from Pennsylvania to Ohio and Michigan .
These states have enacted most of the abortion restrictions now allowed .
Nine states are considering bans similar to the one passed in South Dakota — it 's scheduled to go into effect July 1 — and four states are debating restrictions that would be triggered if the Supreme Court overturned Roe .
• Sixteen state legislatures are likely to continue current access to abortion .
They include every state on the West Coast and almost every state in the Northeast .
A half - dozen already have passed laws that specifically protect abortion rights .
Most of the states in this group have enacted fewer than half of the abortion restrictions now available to states .
• Twelve states fall into a middle ground between those two categories .
About half are in the Midwest , the rest scattered from Arizona to Rhode Island .
The result , according to this analysis , would be less a patchwork of laws than broad regional divisions that generally reinforce the nation 's political split .
All but three of the states likely to significantly restrict abortions voted for President Bush in 2004 .
All but four of the states likely to maintain access to abortion voted for Democrat John Kerry .
The 22 states likely to enact new restrictions include 50 % of the U.S. population and accounted for 37 % of the abortions performed in 2000 , the latest year for which complete data were available .
The 16 states likely to protect access to abortion include 35 % of the U.S. population and accounted for 48 % of the abortions performed .
Other factors to weigh
There are some factors that this analysis does n't take into account .
Among the states ranked as likely to enact new restrictions , Michigan and Wisconsin now have governors who support abortion rights and presumably would veto a ban if they were still in office .
Courts in Florida and Tennessee have ruled that their state constitutions protect abortion rights , limiting the impact of Roe 's reversal .
( That 's not necessarily an insurmountable hurdle , though : Florida voters amended the state constitution in 2004 to allow a law requiring minors seeking abortions to notify their parents , and Tennessee activists are pursuing a constitutional amendment to limit abortion rights there . )
The states ranked as likely to continue current access to abortion could be pre-empted if Congress passed laws that restricted or criminalized abortion nationwide .
And first things first : Reversing
Roe may be a more distant prospect than activists in both camps think .
It would require a change of heart or retirement by at least one of the five current Supreme Court justices who have endorsed it .
What 's more , while the confirmation of two new justices has heartened abortion foes , neither Chief Justice John Roberts nor Justice Samuel Alito has said clearly where he stands on Roe .
In Ohio , Brinkman , a three - term legislator and father of six , acknowledges that he may be rushing things with the bill he has submitted to ban all abortions in the state except those necessary to save the life of the woman .
But the 48 - year - old Republican , who owns a small printing firm in suburban Cincinnati , predicts it 's just a matter of time .
" It will happen , " he declares in an interview just off the floor of the ornate House chamber .
Copeland says Brinkman and other abortion opponents " feel emboldened " by the latest appointments to the U.S. Supreme Court .
" We 're going to be fighting more and more bills , " she says .
Going beyond current law Ohio already has done nearly all it can to restrict abortions .
The state requires women seeking abortions to be told about alternatives and then to wait at least 24 hours .
Hospitals and doctors can refuse to perform them .
Minors must get a parent 's consent .
A controversial late - term procedure that opponents call " partial - birth abortion " is barred .
Brinkman 's bill would go much further .
It would make performing an abortion or transporting a woman across state lines to have an abortion a felony .
Another proposal , sponsored by Rep. Michelle Schneider , also a Republican , would ban abortions at state - funded hospitals and by public employees except those needed to save the life of the mother or mandated by the federal Medicaid program .
It would declare that " the public policy of the state of Ohio ( is ) to prefer childbirth over abortion to the extent that is constitutionally permissible . "
" It 's not the golden ring that a lot of the anti-abortion people want , " concedes Schneider , who owns a nursing home and home health care business in the Cincinnati suburb of Madeira .
She supports Brinkman 's ban but says she worries that it " could take years and years " to test in the courts .
" My bill would take the state of Ohio out of the abortion business " right now , she says .
There 's no guarantee that the Legislature will vote on either measure this year .
Ohio Republicans already are navigating difficult waters .
Gov. Bob
Taft is retiring after being convicted of ethics charges .
U.S. Sen . Mike DeWine faces a tough re-election fight .
U.S. Rep. Bob Ney is enmeshed in the investigation into disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff , although Ney denies wrongdoing .
Some of his fellow Republican officials worry that a debate over abortion could provoke a backlash among moderate voters , Brinkman acknowledges .
John Green , a political scientist at the University of Akron , agrees .
" A lot of Republicans think there 's enough controversy on the table anyway , without having to add the abortion issue , " he says .
Still , Brinkman boasts that a hearing finally has been scheduled on his bill for early next month , and he notes that the Assembly plans a lame - duck session after the November elections .
If a Democrat is elected governor , the Republican - controlled Legislature might rush to enact legislation that Taft can sign before leaving office .
" We could have a substantial lame - duck session — more substantial if a Democrat governor got elected , " Brinkman says .
Either bill would have some prospect of passing .
House Democratic leader Joyce Beatty , 56 , a small - business owner from Columbus who has been a chief statehouse defender of abortion rights , says flatly : " If we voted on this tomorrow in this House , I would lose . "
She estimates that one - third of her fellow Democrats join nearly all Republican legislators in opposing abortion .
Promises , but no guarantees
In fact , 63 of the 99 members of the Ohio House are committed , if Roe is overturned , to support a state ban on abortions except those needed to save the life of the woman .
( Seven members add exceptions in cases of rape and incest . )
Their pledges are posted on the website of Ohio Right to Life , which conducted a candidates ' survey during the 2004 campaign .
Even that is no guarantee , says Denise Mackura , director of governmental relations for the anti-abortion group .
" What candidates say in their surveys sometimes does n't come to pass , " she says .
" People who said they were pro-life as a matter of expediency — I 'd like to think they 're not many , but that would be naïve . "
Both sides are now mustering volunteers for post - Roe battles .
NARAL Pro-Choice
Ohio works out of a cramped bay - window office in a historic neighborhood a mile from the state Capitol in the center of the city .
Ohio Right to Life fills a warren of offices on the second floor of a nondescript office building at the outskirts of town .
Mackura , 54 , a lawyer by training who has been working in the anti-abortion movement since her college days , says her group already has supporters lined up in every district , ready to hold state legislators to their campaign promises .
Copeland , 36 , a former organizer for the AFL - CIO , hopes the intense debate sure to be sparked if a state ban was a legal possibility , not a hypothetical question , would persuade some legislators to change their minds .
She notes that the Roe decision consistently commands majority support in public opinion surveys .
The USA TODAY / CNN / Gallup Poll in January found that Americans backed it by 66 % - 25 % .
In the survey , 53 % said they considered themselves " pro-choice " and 42 % said they were " pro-life , " a breakdown that has stayed about the same for a decade .
In a USA TODAY poll last month , six of 10 Americans opposed statewide bans on abortion ; 36 % supported them .
' A little bit of encouragement '
There was n't much difference on that issue by gender or age , but there was by political party .
A ban that would permit abortions only to save the life of the mother was supported by 54 % of Republicans but opposed by 66 % of Democrats and 70 % of independents .
That 's one reason some anti-abortion leaders are leery of moving too quickly to push broad restrictions .
" We still need to change the culture , " Mackura says , and she cautions against assuming that Roe is history .
Ohio Right to Life supports Brinkman 's goal but has n't endorsed his bill .
" Sometimes when you get a little bit of encouragement you get very excited and you think , ' This is the time to do it , ' " only to be disappointed , she says .
In contrast , groups on the other side of the issue are using the prospect of battles in state capitals to rouse those who support abortion rights but have n't seen the issue as a priority .
Nancy Keenan , president of NARAL Pro-Choice America , says half of the first 900 contributions from the South Dakota appeal came from people who had n't contributed to the group before .
Determining abortion restrictions state - by - state only makes sense to Dorothy Timbs , legislative counsel for the department of state legislation at National Right to Life .
" Obviously the issue would return back to the states to decide for themselves , " she says .
" We believe an issue as sensitive as abortion , that affects so many women and their children , should be up to their legislators who are accountable to the people . "
Nancy Northrup , president of the Center for Reproductive Rights , protests that overturning Roe would make access to a fundamental right dependent on geography .
She predicts it will inflame what is already one of the most divisive issues in American politics .
" It is going to make abortion the center of every local race for office , every state legislative race , of every state judicial race , of every state executive race , not to mention a battle for federal elections , " she says .
" It will be a never - ending battle . "

The Top 10 Intelligent Designs ( or Creation Myths )
Creationism and intelligent design are not science , whereas evolution is a solid scientific theory .
( Image credit : LiveScience )
Several parents won a lawsuit against a Pennsylvania school district in 2005 that had added the controversial theory of " intelligent design " to its curriculum .
Unlike the theory of evolution which is taught at most schools as a fact - based science , " intelligent design " -- as argued by the plaintiffs -- was nothing more than a philosophy predicated on the Judeo - Christian belief that the logical sequences found in nature are not random happenings or surprising mutations , but deftly managed events created by a greater omniscient and omnipresent intelligence with a specific plan .
In short , the work of God .
A federal judge thought otherwise .
But therein lies the rub :
Which god ?
When the founding fathers established the Constitution of the United States , they chose to include the separation of church and state .
This was to ensure that the state - sanctioned religious persecutions that plagued much of Europe during the 16th century would not despoil the young , yet grand experiment in democracy that was to become this Republic .
Scientific research has come a long way since Charles Darwin first posited the concept of " natural selection . "
In the intervening years , humanity has learned much about how we became the dominant species on the planet , how the Earth and the solar system were formed and the ever - changing development of the Universe .
Over that time , how we understand the theory of evolution has also changed .
Scientists now think that there is an intrinsic logic to our reality , that there are absolutes , laws of nature .
Much remains a mystery , and as one question is answered , many others arise .
The question that faced Pennsylvania 's Dover School District was whether or not the imposition of one creation belief on a multi-ethnic , secular student body is in keeping with the law that prohibits the creation of a state religion .
If they allow one belief system to be taught , surely they must also teach others ?
To help out with this dilemma , LiveScience presents a list of those Creation Myths that helped define civilizations both past and present ...
The Genesis of the Judeo - Christian and Islamic Faiths
Gifts from a Stranger : Adam and Eve , bears the following marking : ' Albrecht Durer of Nuremberg made this engraving in 1504 '
Genesis , the first book of the Jewish Torah and the Christian Bible , contains two origin stories , both of which are accepted as the creation of the world by today 's Jewish , Christian and Islamic faiths .
In the first , God says , " Let there be light , " and light appears .
In six days , he creates the sky , the land , plants , the sun and moon , animals , and all creatures , including humans .
To all he says , " Be fruitful and multiply , " which they do .
On the seventh day God rests , contemplates his handiwork , and gives himself a good evaluation .
In the second story , God creates the first man , Adam , from the earth .
He makes a garden in Eden for Adam , but forbids him to eat fruit from the " Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil . "
Adam names the animals but remains lonely .
God anesthetizes Adam and makes one of his ribs into the first woman , Eve .
A talking serpent persuades her to eat the forbidden fruit , and she convinces Adam to do likewise .
When God finds out , he drives them from the garden and makes man mortal .
They should have stuck with apricots !
The Greeks and the Titans
Dads , think twice about curfew : The Mutilation of Uranus by Cronus , by Vasari and Gherardi .

The early Greek poets posited various cosmogonies .
The best - preserved is Hesiod 's Theogony .
In this hymn , out of the primordial chaos came the earliest divinities , including Gaia ( mother earth ) .
Gaia created Uranus , the sky , to cover herself .
They spawned a bizarre menagerie of gods and monsters , including the Hecatonchires , monsters with 50 heads and a hundred hands , and the Cyclopes , the " wheel - eyed , " later forgers of Zeus 's thunderbolts .
Next came the gods known as the Titans , 6 sons and 6 daughters .
Uranus , despising his monstrous children , imprisoned them in Tartarus , the earth 's bowels .
Enraged , Gaia made an enormous sickle and gave it to her youngest son , Cronus , with instructions .
When next Uranus appeared to copulate with Gaia , Cronus sprang out and hacked off his father 's genitals !
Where Uranus 's blood and naughty bits fell , there sprang forth more monsters , the Giants and Furies .
From the sea foam churned up by the the holy testicles came the goddess Aphrodite .
Later , Cronus fathered the next generation of gods , Zeus and the Olympians .
And , boy , were they dysfunctional !
Hindu Cosmology 's Rendezvous with Brahma
The Other Trinity : Brahma , the creator , is pictured with four heads , though he used to have five .
( Image credit : public domain )
The Hindu cosmology contains many myths of creation , and the principal players have risen and fallen in importance over the centuries .
The earliest Vedic text , the Rig Veda , tells of a gigantic being , Purusha , possessing a thousand heads , eyes , and feet .
He enveloped the earth , extending beyond it by the space of ten fingers .
When the gods sacrificed Purusha , his body produced clarified butter , which engendered the birds and animals .
His body parts transformed into the world 's elements , and the gods Agni , Vayu , and Indra .
Also , the four castes of Hindu society were created from his body : the priests , warriors , general populace , and the servants .
Historically later , the trinity of Brahma ( the creator ) , Vishnu ( the preserver ) , and Shiva ( the destroyer ) gained prominence .
Brahma appears in a lotus sprouting from the navel of the sleeping Vishnu .
Brahma creates the universe , which lasts for one of his days , or 4.32 billion years .
Then Shiva destroys the universe and the cycle restarts .
Relax everybody , the current cycle has a couple billion years left .
Japan , this Island Earth
All in the Family : Izanagi and Izanami , the siblings that brought forth Japan and its inhabitants .
( Image credit : public domain )
The gods created two divine siblings , brother Izanagi and sister Izanami , who stood upon a floating bridge above the primordial ocean .
Using the jeweled spear of the gods , they churned up the first island , Onogoro .
Upon the island , Izanagi and Izanami married , and gave forth progeny that were malformed .
The gods blamed it upon a breach of protocol .
During the marriage ritual , Izanami , the woman , had spoken first .
Correctly reprising their marriage ritual , the two coupled and produced the islands of Japan and more deities .
However , in birthing Kagutsuchi - no - Kami , the fire god , Izanami died .
Traumatized , Izanagi followed her to Yomi , the land of the dead .
Izanami , having eaten the food of Yomi , could not return .
When Izanagi suddenly saw Izanami 's decomposing body , he was terrified and fled .
Izanami , enraged , pursued him , accompanied by hideous women .
Izanagi hurled personal items at them , which transformed into diversions .
Escaping the cavern entrance of Yomi , he blocked it with a boulder , thus permanently separating life from death .

Between a Rock and a Hard Place : Pan -gu separates the Earth from the Sky .
( Image credit : public domain )
A cosmic egg floated within the timeless void , containing the opposing forces of yin and yang .
After eons of incubation , the first being , Pan - gu emerged .
The heavy parts ( yin ) of the egg drifted downwards , forming the earth .
The lighter parts ( yang ) rose to form the sky .
Pan - gu , fearing the parts might re-form , stood upon the earth and held up the sky .
He grew 10 feet per day for 18,000 years , until the sky was 30,000 miles high .
His work completed , he died .
His parts transformed into elements of the universe , whether animals , weather phenomena , or celestial bodies .
Some say the fleas on him became humans , but there is another explanation .
The goddess Nuwa was lonely , so she fashioned men out of mud from the Yellow River .
These first humans delighted her , but took long to make , so she flung muddy droplets over the earth , each one becoming a new person .
These hastily - made people became the commoners , with the earlier ones being the nobles the first example of mass - production !
South of the Border , Down Mexico Way : The Aztecs
Mother !
Please ! :
Coatlicue was depicted as a woman with a skirt of snakes and a necklace of hearts torn from her victims .
( Image credit : Wikimedia commons user Luidger )
The earth mother of the Aztecs , Coatlicue ( " skirt of snakes , " ) is depicted in a fearsome way , wearing a necklace of human hearts and hands , and a skirt of snakes as her name suggests .
The story goes that Coatlicue was impregnated by an obsidian knife and gave birth to Coyolxauhqui , goddess of the moon , and to 400 sons , who became the stars of the southern sky .
Later , a ball of feathers fell from the sky which , upon Coatlicue finding it and placing it in her waistband , caused her to become pregnant again .
Coyolxauhqui and her brothers turned against their mother , whose unusual pregnancy shocked and outraged them , the origin being unknown .
However , the child inside Coatlique , Huitzilopochtli , the god of war and the sun god , sprang from his mother 's womb , fully - grown and armored ( talk about a C - section ! ) .
He attacked Coyolxauhqui , killing her with the aid of a fire serpent .
Cutting off her head , he flung it into the sky , where it became the moon .
That was supposed to comfort Coatlicue , his mother -- some comfort !
Spirits of Ancient Egypt
Ra-Horakhty and Atum .

The ancient Egyptians had several creation myths .
All begin with the swirling , chaotic waters of Nu ( or Nun ) .
Atum willed himself into being , and then created a hill , otherwise there 'd be no place for him to stand .
Atum was genderless and possessed an all - seeing eye .
He / she spat out a son , Shu , god of the air .
Atum then vomited up a daughter , Tefnut , goddess of moisture .
These two were charged with the task of creating order out of chaos .
Shu and Tefnut generated Geb , the earth , and Nut , the sky .
First they were entwined , but Geb lifted Nut above him .
Gradually the world 's order formed , but Shu and Tefnut became lost in the remaining darkness .
Atum removed his / her all - seeing eye and sent it in search of them .
( Just how all - seeing it was , and what did Atum do without , remains a mystery . )
When Shu and Tefnut returned , thanks to the eye , Atum wept with joy .
( Presumably he / she re-inserted the eye first . )
Where the tears struck the earth , men sprang up .
By the Rivers of Babylon
Marduk 's battle with Anzu .
Assyrian relief ( Image credit : public domain )
The Babylonian creation myth , the Enuma Elish , begins with the gods of water , Apsu ( fresh ) , and Tiamat ( salt ) , spawning several generations of gods , leading to Ea and his many brothers .
However , these younger gods made so much noise that Apsu and Tiamat could not sleep ( a complaint still common today amongst apartment - dwellers ) .
Apsu plotted to kill them , but Ea killed him first .
Tiamat vowed revenge and created many monsters , including the Mad Dog and Scorpion Man .
Ea and the goddess Damkina created Marduk , a giant god with four eyes and four ears , as their protector .
In tangling with Tiamat , Marduk , bearing the winds as weapons , hurled an evil wind down her gullet , incapacitating her , and then killed her with a single arrow to her heart .
He then split her body in half and used it to create the heavens and the earth .
Later he created man to do the drudge work that the gods refused to do , like farming , telemarketing and accounting .
( Marduk currently appears on Cartoon Network 's Sealab 2020 ! )
Zoroastrianism , the Religion of Ancient Persia

The Bundahishn of the Middle Persian era tells of the world created by the deity Ahura Mazda .
The great mountain , Alburz , grew for 800 years until it touched the sky .
From that point , rain fell , forming the Vourukasha sea and two great rivers .
The first animal , the white bull , lived on the bank of the river Veh Rod .
However , the evil spirit , Angra Mainyu , killed it .
Its seed was carried to the moon and purified , creating many animals and plants .
Across the river lived the first man , Gayomard , bright as the sun .
Angra Mainyu also killed him .
Ouch !
The sun purified his seed for forty years , which then sprouted a rhubarb plant .
This plant grew into Mashya and Mashyanag , the first mortals .
Instead of killing them , Angra Mainyu deceived them into worshipping him .
After 50 years they bore twins , but they ate the twins , owing to their sin .
After a very long time , two more twins were born , and from them came all humans ( but specifically Persians ) .
Hammer of the Gods : Norse Mythology
Mother 's Milk :
The giant cow Auehumla feeds Ymir with her milk .
( Image credit : public domain )
With its bounty of brawny , barrel - chested gods and buxom goddesses , the ancient Norse religion of the Scandinavian and Germanic countries is truly the creation myth for fans of both pro wrestling and heavy metal music .
According to Norse lore , before there was Earth ( Midgard ) , there was Muspell , a fiery land guarded by the fire sword - wielding Surt ; Ginnungagap , a great void , and Niflheim , a frozen ice - covered land .
When the cold of Niflheim touched the fires of Muspell , the giant Ymir and a behemothic cow , Auï¿½humla , emerged from the thaw .
Then , the cow licked the god Bor and his wife into being .
The couple gave birth to Buri , who fathered three sons , Odin , Vili , and Vï¿½ .
The sons rose up and killed Ymir and from his corpse created from his flesh , the Earth ; the mountains from his bones , trees with his hair and rivers , and the seas and lakes with his blood .
Within Ymir 's hollowed - out skull , the gods created the starry heavens .
What can we say : Pure metal magic !!

In Big Macs vs. The Naked Chef , Joel derides the least common denominator effect of formal methodologies :
Some things need talent to do really well .
It 's hard to scale talent .
One way people try to scale talent is by having the talent create rules for the untalented to follow .
The quality of the resulting product is very low .
You can see the exact same story playing out in IT consulting .
How many times have you heard this story ?
Mike was unhappy .
He had hired a huge company of IT consultants to build The System .
The IT consultants he hired were incompetents who kept talking about " The Methodology " and who spent millions of dollars and had failed to produce a single thing .
Luckily , Mike found a youthful programmer who was really smart and talented .
The youthful programmer built his whole system in one day for $ 20 and pizza .
Mike was overjoyed .
He recommended the youthful programmer to all his friends .
Youthful Programmer starts raking in the money .
Soon , he has more work than he can handle , so he hires a bunch of people to help him .
The good people want too many stock options , so he decides to hire even younger programmers right out of college and " train them " with a 6 week course .
The trouble is that the " training " does n't really produce consistent results , so Youthful Programmer starts creating rules and procedures that are meant to make more consistent results .
Over the years , the rule book grows and grows .
Soon it 's a six - volume manual called The Methodology .
After a few dozen years , Youthful Programmer is now a Huge Incompetent IT Consultant with a capital - M- methodology and a lot of people who blindly obey the Methodology , even when it does n't seem to be working , because they have no bloody idea whatsoever what else to do , and they 're not really talented programmers – they 're just well - meaning Poli Sci majors who attended the six - week course .
And Newly Huge Incompetent IT Consultant starts messing up .
Their customers are unhappy .
And another upstart talented programmer comes and takes away all their business , and the cycle begins anew .
What 's the moral of the story ?
Beware of Methodologies .
They are a great way to bring everyone up to a dismal , but passable , level of performance , but at the same time , [ Methodologies ] are aggravating to more talented people who chafe at the restrictions that are placed on them .
It 's pretty obvious to me that a talented chef is not going to be happy making burgers at McDonald 's , precisely because of McDonald 's rules .
So why do IT consultants brag so much about their methodologies ?
There 's a whole world of language features that we sometimes miss out on as Rubyists , such as pattern matching , S - expressions , and external domain - specific languages .
But the good news is that we can have them , too , as long as we 're not afraid to steal a few things first .

Creating DSLs with Ruby 3 comments by Jim Freeze , March 16 , 2006 , Broadly speaking , there are two ways to create a DSL .
One is to invent a syntax from scratch , and build an interpreter or compiler .
The other is to tailor an existing general - purpose language by adding or changing methods , operators , and default actions .
This article explores using the latter method to build a DSL on top of Ruby .

Are the Vulcans , as popularized by Commander Spock of Star Trek fame , really future Austrians in disguise ?
Here 's the scenario :
In about 100 years the last tiny group of fugitive Austrians come up with two brilliant plans .
The first is to escape the Earth using gravitic wave engines , and the second is to wear prosthetic wax ears and bad haircuts for the rest of time , to avoid being spotted by the rest of humanity when it eventually catches up with the Austrian Diaspora .
How do I know this scenario to be true ?
The clues are there .
All you have to do is examine Vulcan wisdom , via Spock 's own recorded quotations , sent back to us via a cunning time capsule process and inserted into the famous TV series to help us eventually escape the thrall of the state .
Let 's begin with an overview :
Being a Vulcan means to adopt a philosophy , a way of life which is logical and beneficial .
We cannot disregard that philosophy merely for personal gain , no matter how important that gain might be .
— Journey to Babel
Or in other words , if you want to understand the social sciences , adopt the praxeological method of a priori logic .
You need to have your theory straight before you begin to try to come to some clear understanding of how the world around you works .
In the long term some of us may die , but our children will succeed to inherit our decisions , good or bad .
So if you want your children and your neighbor 's children to prosper , always follow the Austrian method of logic .
Violence in reality is quite different from theory —

In other words , a coherent and orderly society cannot be imposed by force but rather results from agreeement and exchange .
Force results in consequences different from that anticipated .
Also , people get hurt .
You 'll notice that the warmongers among you never send themselves , or their children , or their friends ' children into battle .
There is a reason for this .
They are stupid but cleverer than they appear .
They are perfectly willing to use your children and your wealth to further their own material ends and their own power addiction needs .
Men of peace usually are brave —
The Savage Curtain
If you fail to stand up to attack , expect to be attacked .
You must defend your property if you are to retain it .
You must be brave to defend yourself .
But never break the first and only Vulcan commandment : the use of force is justified only in response to force , or a threat of force , directed against one 's property rights .
This is the way of peace .
Physical reality is consistent with universal laws .
Where the laws do not operate , there is no reality .
— Spectre of the Gun
Avoid the smoke and mirrors empiricism of the Chicago School , especially Coase .
( The Vulcans seem to have this intense bitterness towards the Chicago school , or the Romulans , as they themselves call them .
Romulans , they believe , are almost like Vulcans , leading to a confusion of the two distinct philosophies by outsiders .
By the way , the Vulcans have no problems with the Klingons , because at least these armored buffoons can be seen in daylight for what they truly are ; straightforward warmongering statists . )
Insufficient facts always invite danger — Space Seed
We can never have all the facts , so it is folly to attempt to draw broad conclusions only from what we can observe .
Without followers , evil cannot spread —
And The Children Shall Lead
The over mighty state always tries to make the impression that it is invulnerable for all of time ; witness the slogans of the Third Reich , the Soviet Union , and the Republican Party , but they always need the support of the people if they are to survive .
This is why they constantly bribe their indolent indentured intellectuals to propagandize on their behalf .
These intellectuals are the followers .
They are the ones who spread the evil .
Remove the influence of the followers and the evil will dissipate like mist in the wind .
Ok , it 's a lot to read into five words , but I think I 've caught the gist of it .
Humans do have an amazing capacity for believing what they choose ; and excluding that which is painful — And The Children Shall Lead
Your time preferences are amazingly high .
This is the route to decivilization .
Unhappiness is the state which occurs in the human when wants and desires are not fulfilled — I , Mudd
And it is this unhappiness which leads to the drive to Human Action , the basis of all sensible economics .
( By the way , I have a digital copy of the scholars edition in my tricorder .
Would you like to see it ? )
Superior ability breeds superior ambition — Space Seed
Freedom of association will lead naturally to inequality , and the formation of natural elites .
The trick is to prevent one of these families of nobles from usurping all the others with an appeal to the common people to create a monopoly on justice .
But if you can manage this trick , you will reach the same state of mutual tolerance as we have reached on Vulcan .
This troubled planet is a place of most violent contrasts ; those who receive the rewards are totally separated from those who shoulder the burdens .
It is not a wise leadership — The Cloud Minders
To avoid the welfare and warfare state , taxation must be removed or it , and its agents , will eventually destroy you .
Change is the essential process of all existence — Let That Be Your Last Battlefield
I also have a copy of Man , Economy , and State , with Power and Market , in the tricorder .
In every mutual trade exchange things improve , on both sides , for the better .
This is what drives the market .
This is what drives existence .
This is what sustains and improves existence .
The lessons are clear , the implications obvious .
Follow the one true way to Vulcanism .
Remove all forms of compulsory exchange .
Those who hate and fight must stop themselves ; otherwise it is not stopped — Day of the Dove
Follow the Jeffersonian path of peace and freedom , of free markets and defensive military isolationism .
Just as those who war with market forces produce chaos , one aggressive military intervention will always necessitate another , until eventually you will have troops in ever corner of the world .
The hatred this generates will eventually necessitate troops on every street corner of your own land .
So if you want peace , stop inflicting peace on other nations , otherwise you will enter a permanent Klingon realm of total war .
You humans find it easier to understand the death of one than the death of a million —
The Immunity Syndrome
Next time you see a politician weeping over the death of one child close to them , wonder if the price they paid for killing millions of children remote from them , which caused this single death , was really worth it .
And of course :
Live long and prosper
Follow the Austrian way of peace .
Adopt as a way of life social tolerance , laissez faire capitalism , and the avoidance of aggressive war , and you and your descendants will live long and prosper beyond the current possibilities of your wildest dreams .
In all seriousness , many science fiction writers in the 1950s and 1960s were deeply interested in the ideas of freedom and many may have read Ayn Rand 's Atlas Shrugged .
Perhaps some of those who contributed to Star Trek were fascinated enough by Rand 's promotion of Von Mises to investigate his economics in Human Action , which then helped them add a deeper philosophical quality to Commander Spock 's logic ?
We will never know and I am admittedly leaping in the dark , but some of quotes above ring too close to be coincidental .
For instance , let 's take a direct quote from Human Action :
We call contentment or satisfaction that state of a human being which does not and cannot result in any action .
Acting man is eager to substitute a more satisfactory state of affairs for a less satisfactory .
His mind imagines conditions which suit him better , and his action aims at bringing about this desired state .
The incentive that impels a man to act is always some uneasiness .
A man perfectly content with the state of his affairs would have no incentive to change things .
He would have neither wishes nor desires ; he would be perfectly happy .
He would not act ; he would simply live free from care .
If you had to paraphrase that , would the following quote from I , Mudd be a good summary ?
Unhappiness is the state which occurs in the human when wants and desires are not fulfilled .
I think it would .
So let 's just take that leap and say there is no doubt .
Spock was an Austro - libertarian .
We therefore must be the future Vulcans .
Does anyone have any wax ?

Tony Blair and George Bush at the White House
The spokesman said Mr Bush gave a " one- line " apology for the fact proper procedures had not been followed .
The two men held talks in the US on Friday over the Middle East crisis .
Some air traffic controllers at Prestwick , near Glasgow , have raised concerns about handling flights carrying bombs .
The result of an investigation into the Israeli - bound bomb cargo flights is expected to be made known on Monday .
As part of the introduction , the president said sorry there was a problem
Tony Blair 's spokesman
The Civil Aviation Authority has been conducting an inquiry into the landings , which the Foreign Office believes may have broken rules .
Briefing reporters after the discussions , Mr Blair 's official spokesman told reporters : " President Bush did apologise for the fact that proper procedures were not followed , but that was all .
" It was just one line .
As part of the introduction , the president said sorry there was a problem .
" It was a gracious thing to do . "
' Very uncomfortable '
BBC Scotland has learned that staff were unhappy about dealing with the US planes because flight plans appeared to mention that there were bombs on board .
Some of the 200 air traffic controllers said they were " very uncomfortable " handling certain aircraft .
Unions have considered an approach to the management as a result .
One air traffic controller , who did not want to be identified , said : " We usually do n't know the cargo that is on board but for some reason this one 's flight plan was brazenly advertising it was carrying bombs .
" People are very uncomfortable with that .
An inquiry will reveal whether the flights needed or had permissions
" We usually do n't have time to worry about what 's on board but there is a feeling that this is not good .
" We work with military aircraft all the time and people here are professional .
" They would never leave traffic that needs to be dealt with but there are people who feel uncomfortable working with certain aircraft . "
The Foreign Office 's concern is a matter of procedure because the cargo does not appear to have been notified as it should have been .
Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett has raised concerns with the US Government .
Following Mrs Beckett 's open display of displeasure over the flights issue , a White House spokesman said he was sure procedures were in order .
Immediate ceasefire
First Minister Jack McConnell is under pressure to prevent further arms shipments using Scottish soil .
His office said aviation and foreign policy were matters reserved to Westminster .
Backbenchers have urged Mr Blair to push for an immediate ceasefire between Israeli forces and Hezbollah .
A senior Scottish Labour MP said the prime minister must stop defying public opinion over the crisis in Lebanon .
Mohammed Sarwar , who is chair of the Scottish Affairs Committee at Westminster , said he was " really disappointed " in the government for refusing to call for a ceasefire .
The Glasgow Central MSP also said it is " totally unacceptable " that US planes used a Scottish airport while carrying bombs to Israel and said it must not happen again .
The Original Macintosh : 9 of 127 Reality Distortion Field Author : Andy Hertzfeld Date : February 1981 Characters : Steve Jobs , Bud Tribble Topics : Management , Personality , Reality Distortion Summary : Bud defines
Steve 's unique talent I officially started on the Mac project on a Thursday afternoon , and Bud Tribble , my new manager and the only other software person on the project , was out of town .
Bud was on leave of absence from an M.D. - Ph.D. program and he had to occasionally return to Seattle to keep up his standing in the program .
Bud usually did n't come into work until after lunch , so I met with him for the first time the following Monday afternoon .
We started talking about all the work that had to be done , which was pretty overwhelming .
He showed me the official schedule for developing the software that had us shipping in about ten months , in early January 1982 .
" Bud , that 's crazy ! " , I told him .
" We 've hardly even started yet .
There 's no way we can get it done by then . "
" I know , " he responded , in a low voice , almost a whisper .
" You know ?
If you know the schedule is off - base , why do n't you correct it ? "
" Well , it 's Steve .
Steve insists that we 're shipping in early 1982 , and wo n't accept answers to the contrary .
The best way to describe the situation is a term from Star Trek .
Steve has a reality distortion field . "
" A what ? "
" A reality distortion field .
In his presence , reality is malleable .
He can convince anyone of practically anything .
It wears off when he's not around , but it makes it hard to have realistic schedules .
And there 's a couple of other things you should know about working with Steve . "
" What else ? "
" Well , just because he tells you that something is awful or great , it does n't necessarily mean he 'll feel that way tomorrow .
You have to low - pass filter his input .
And then , he 's really funny about ideas .
If you tell him a new idea , he 'll usually tell you that he thinks it 's stupid .
But then , if he actually likes it , exactly one week later , he 'll come back to you and propose your idea to you , as if he thought of it . "
I thought Bud was surely exaggerating , until I observed Steve in action over the next few weeks .
The reality distortion field was a confounding melange of a charismatic rhetorical style , an indomitable will , and an eagerness to bend any fact to fit the purpose at hand .
If one line of argument failed to persuade , he would deftly switch to another .
Sometimes , he would throw you off balance by suddenly adopting your position as his own , without acknowledging that he ever thought differently .
Amazingly , the reality distortion field seemed to be effective even if you were acutely aware of it , although the effects would fade after Steve departed .
We would often discuss potential techniques for grounding it ( see Are You Gonna Do It ?

Migrants complain of ill treatment by Moroccan security forces
The incident sparked international criticism of how Spain and Morocco deal with immigrants trying to enter Europe .
Six people were killed on 6 October in a mass raid on the double razor - wired fence which separates the Spanish territory of Melilla from Morocco .
An inquiry by the Spanish civil guard has cleared its troops of involvement .
' Dumping ' denied
Now a report released by the Moroccan interior ministry says a spray of gunfire from Moroccan security forces killed four of the migrants , believed to be from West Africa .
The other two , says the report , died from multiple wounds .
It is not clear from the report whether they were also shot or died in a stampede which followed .
Moroccan Foreign Minister Mohammed Ben Aissa , described the incident as " regrettable " .
The Moroccan government continues to deny , however , that it has pursued a policy of dumping sub-Saharan Africans in the desert without food or water in an attempt to deal with unprecedented waves of illegal immigration across its soil this month .
However , Medecins Sans Frontieres and other humanitarian organisations have presented evidence to the contrary .
It has been behind some of the 20th century 's most famous images : the young Vietnamese girl running naked down a street , the American soldiers storming Omaha beach in the Normandy landings , and the point - blank execution of a Vietcong prisoner .
Leica cameras have also been used by the world 's most famous photographers , including Henri Cartier - Bresson , Robert Capa and the AP photographer Nick Ut .
But now the German product is on the brink of disappearing .
Next week its manufacturer is holding an extraordinary general meeting following a disastrous year which saw a record € 15.5 m ( £ 10.7 m ) loss for the company .
Amid a sales slump , Leica will ask its shareholders to approve a € 22 m recapitalisation plan to turn around its fortunes .
But if the plan fails the company , which single - handedly revolutionised photography in the 1920s and 1930s with its pioneering 35 mm camera , is likely to go under .
" We are in deep financial difficulties , " Gero Furchheim , a spokesman for the firm Leica Camera AG , said yesterday .
Analysts say the company 's woes are largely due to its failure to enter the digital camera market while demand for its expensive high - quality analogue equipment stagnated .
Sales of Leicas , which can cost as much as € 10,000 , have also suffered from the high euro and from the depressed economies of Germany and France .
Founded in 1849 by Ernst Leitz in the German town of Wetzlar , the firm first spe cialised in making microscopes and optical equipment .
In 1925 , however , it produced its first 35 mm camera .
The development freed users from the cumbersome large - format cameras and tripods .
Photographers such as Henri Cartier - Bresson , who acquired his first Leica in 1932 and called the camera " anextension of my eye " , were able to exploit photography 's new - found mobility .
Many of Cartier - Bresson 's most famous images were taken with a Leica .
They include the moustached , bowler hatted man caught peeping through the canvas surround at a sports event in Brussels in 1932 ; the female prisoner denouncing a Gestapo informer in 1945 ; a boyish Truman Capote in 1947 ; and children playing on the Berlin wall in 1962 .
Small , lightweight and unobtrusive , the Leica made it possible to capture the gritty realism of modern warfare .
When Capa took his grainy shots of allied troops landing on Omaha beach he did so with a Leica .
After the war , the Leica remained the camera of choice for Cartier - Bresson and Capa , two of the co-founders of the world 's most celebrated picture agency , Magnum .
Yesterday the German firm insisted that its products still had appeal , despite ferocious competition from cheaper Japanese and Chinese rivals .
" We can't be a market leader .
But we are optimistic we can still be a successful niche player , " Mr Furchheim told the Guardian , speaking from the factory in Solms , near Frankfurt , where most Leicas are still made .
He added : " If someone just wants to show a young boy throwing a stone in Ramallah they will use a digital camera .
If they want to shoot a whole story , explaining what is happening there and why the boy is doing it , they will use a Leica .
It 's a more intimate tool .
With a Leica you can develop your own style , your own handwriting .
The fact that we have been linked to reportage across the world is our great strength . "
The company , which has replaced its chief executive , appears to be pinning its hopes on its pioneering digital camera , the digital module R , which allows photographers to use the same camera body for digital and film pictures .
It is due to appear on the market " in the next few weeks or months " .
Researchers at the University of Toronto have created a laser that could help save the $ 200 - billion dollar computer chip industry from a looming crisis dubbed the " interconnect bottleneck . "
But this is n't a laser in the stereotypical sense -- no corded , clunky boxes projecting different coloured lights .
In fact , Professor Ted Sargent , of the Edward S. Rogers Sr. Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering , carries a small vial of the paint used to make this laser in his briefcase -- it looks like diluted ink .
Lasers that can produce coherent infrared light in the one to two nanometre wavelength range are essential in telecommunications , biomedical diagnosis and optical sensing .
The speed and density of computer chips has risen exponentially over the years , and within 15 to 20 years the industry is expected to reach a point where components can't get any faster .
But the interconnect bottleneck -- the point where microchips reach their capacity -- is expected sometime around 2010 .
To tackle this problem , Sargent , a Canada Research Chair in Nanotechnology , created the new laser using colloidal quantum dots -- nanometre - sized particles of semiconductor that are suspended in a solvent like the particles in paint .
" We 've made a laser that can be smeared onto another material , " says Sargent .
" This is the first paint - on semiconductor laser to produce the invisible colours of light needed to carry information through fiber - optics .
The infrared light could , in the future , be used to connect microprocessors on a silicon computer chip . "
A study describing the laser was published in the April 17 issue of the journal Optics Express .
According to Sjoerd Hoogland , a post - doctoral fellow and the first author of the paper , " this laser could help us to keep feeding the information - hungry Internet generation . "
The laser 's most remarkable feature was its simplicity .
" I made the laser by dipping a miniature glass tube in the paint and then drying it with a hairdryer , " he said .
" Once the right nanoparticles are made , the procedure takes about five minutes . "
The microchip industry is looking for components that exist on the scale of transistors and are made of semiconductors , which would produce light when exposed to electrical current .
With this development , it could be possible to use the electronics already found on microchips to power a laser that communicates within the chip itself .
" We crystallized precisely the size of the nanoparticles that would tune the colour of light coming from the laser .
We chose nanoparticle size , and thus colour , the way a guitarist chooses frets to select the pitch of the instrument , " Hoogland said .
" Optical data transfer relies on light in the infrared - - beams of light 1.5 micrometers in wavelength travel farthest in glass .
We made our particles just the right size to generate laser light at exactly this wavelength . "
Lionel C. Kimerling , Thomas Lord Professor of Materials Science and director of the Microphotonics Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , reviewed the work .
" The wavelength and the thermal budget of the Toronto laser are very appealing for applications in optical interconnects , " Kimerling says .
" The performance is excellent , particularly the temperature insensitivity of the output wavelength . "

The utopian dream of ubiquitous media access is on the verge of becoming a reality .
Consumers can watch TV on their iPods , download sports highlights to their cell phones , and take vast libraries of music with them wherever they go .
You would think that all of these new digital distribution systems would be a boon for consumers , but that is n’t necessarily the case .
There are signs that media companies are using the transition to digital distribution as an opportunity to redefine consumer expectations about the value of media products , while at the same time eliminating much of what is currently considered to be fair use .
When consumers buy digital music , movies , or television programs from iTunes , Amazon , and most other digital content sources , they are ultimately paying more , getting less , and being forced to make platform decisions with long term implications .
Here are nine reasons why most digital media products are a bad deal for consumers :
Digital media prices are too expensive when compared to traditional media products .
iTunes album prices are generally $ 2 to $ 3 below the price you would expect to pay for a discounted CD .
Amazon Unbox is actually charging the same price for many downloadable movies as they are for the DVD editions .
The price differential is negligible when you consider the risks and disadvantages associated with digital media .
Given the limitations imposed on digital media products , you would expect digital movies and music to be sold at a more substantial discount .
Consumers supply their own bandwidth and physical media .
If you burn your music to a CD , you provide the blank disks .
When you download a movie , you supply the bandwidth .
Media and bandwidth are roughly equivalent to what the entertainment industry calls “ manufacturing and distribution ” .
Those are costs that used to be fronted by media companies and built into the price of their products .
In the era of digital downloads consumers are now bearing the costs of manufacturing and distribution .
Meanwhile media companies are still including those costs in the price of their digital products .
You could argue that Apple and Amazon are providing bandwidth as well – and while that ’s certainly true , the media companies are still benefiting from the fact that someone else is paying for the transfer of bits .
In a future article we ’ll take a look at how media companies use digital media products to take advantage of their partners .
Packaging not included .
CD covers , jewel boxes , and liner notes are a thing of the past .
When you buy a digital media product physical artifacts are obviously not included .
In some instances you may get a PDF download from iTunes , but it ’s up to the consumer to foot the bill for printing ( color ink is n’t cheap ) .
Where the price of digital media products is lower than physical media products , the corresponding price differential is usually not enough to make up for the fact that the product does not include any of the traditional packaging .
Product extras are frequently missing .
While digital albums may provide bonus tracks , digital movies usually do n’t include the DVD extras .
Platform lock - in .
Thanks to proprietary and incompatible DRM systems almost all digital media products released by major studios require consumers to choose a platform and lock - in to the selected platform .
If you buy an iPod you ’ll be limiting yourself to iTunes .
If you buy a Zune , then you ’ll be limiting yourself to the Zune Marketplace .
Would you buy a DVD player if you could only buy movies from Best Buy ?
Or a CD player if you could only buy music from Tower Records ( if you did , you might be re-thinking your decision right about now ) .
When you buy a CD or DVD you expect it to work across a broad range of devices , and for a very long time .
There are no such guarantees in the digital realm .
Consumers who bought into Microsoft ’s PlaysForSure standard are about to be left behind when Zune is released .
Who stands to benefit from these changing standards ?
Everyone but the consumer .
Shorter product life - span .
Digital media products arguably have a much shorter product life - cycle and will require more frequent replacement than physical media products .
You might decide you want to change player platforms , which would require you repurchasing all of your DRM encrypted music , or maybe your hard disk dies and you have no backup .
There are all sorts of scenarios that could quickly wipe out your digital media collection .
Comparatively speaking it would take a much larger disaster to wipe out a physical CD or DVD collection .
No returns .
Ever try to return a song to iTunes ?
Ca n’t be done .
Sure , they might let you re-download the track if there was something wrong with the source file , but in general digital products cannot be returned in the same way physical media products can .
It should also be noted that media companies have traditionally budgeted for product returns .
It is assumed that a certain percentage of any given media product will be returned by retail outlets as unsold merchandise .
The costs associated with those returned items are built into the price you pay for CDs and DVDs .
You would expect the fact that digital products ca n’t be returned to be reflected by a lower price .
No resale value .
So you logged onto iTunes in a drunken haze and downloaded the complete works of A Flock of Seagulls .
What happens after the hangover has passed an you realize your mistake ?
In the good old days you could take your used CD ’s down to the nearest record store and sell them for cash or credit .
When you buy digital media products that ’s not an option .
The traditional Right of First Sale has been stripped away in the digital age .
Fair use restrictions .
Most digital media products come with a variety of limitations designed to restrict their usage .
Depending on the source , you may or may not have the ability to make a copy for personal use .
Likewise , DRM restrictions may prevent you from playing your media content on the device of your choice .
And do n’t even think about sharing with your friends .
Despite Microsoft ’s attempt to facilitate legal file sharing , digital media products ca n’t be shared in the same way physical media products can .
While it ’s perfectly legal to loan a DVD box set to your neighbor , you would likely have to break any number of federal laws to do the same with the digital equivalent of the same content .
When you add it all up digital distribution does n’t look like such a good deal for consumers .
At the very least media companies will need to adjust their pricing to reflect the reduced value of digital media products .

This spoof film will bring back memories for some and is always fun to watch again .
The message about choosing good organic food , from 2005 , is still valid today with the current list of Clean 15 & Dirty Dozen foods .
Nonprofits are still involved in helping to promote the benefits of buying and eating organic produce when you shop at grocery stores .
You can also buy organic produce at stores like brandless.com or Safeway .

I was reading the April 2006 issue of Business 2.0 , entitled “ Best Kept Secrets of the World ’s Best Companies ” .
What struck me was that the companies profiled are jumbo , mega - corporations ( immediately causing a frown and the question “ why are n’t there any small or medium sized companies ? ” .
I doubt that these are the company ’s best kept secrets , but the ideas are interesting if you remember they were designed for and implemented in large organizations ( which we seem to associate with success ) .
The ideas presented were :
Benchmarking – compare everything to the competition Lending library – have materials available that can provoke creativity Devil ’s advocacy - promote debate Physically put the boss in the day to day operations
Look for bad news and talk about it Use external consultants to promote ideas and research Creative equity arrangements for start - ups , new projects Everyone is the HR department Review and question strategy Peers chose their leaders Creative economic solution to avoid theft and loss Executive pay determined by results and collaboration Prediction markets Graffiti , promote communication outside “ normal ” channels
Use greed to motivate , sell and inspire Maintain work related contact with retirees Crowdsourcing and open - source advertising Use employees to watch trends and monitor the market Hire someone to watch shareholder interests , not the CEO 3 minute daily morning meeting Get board members out regularly with customers and front - line workers
Get executives out with customers and product / service users
Pay your people if they save you money
Take the “ hard sell ” out of your sales force Become a customer of your own company
First thought :
Is it practical or necessary for small and medium sized companies to embrace and implement these ideas and strategies ( In a large organization there are large problems , in a small organization there are small ones ) ?
Second thought :
Given the multi-tasking of all employees and executives in small and medium sized organizations , is it realistic to expect results that echo the large corporations if these ideas are implemented on a smaller level ?
If you believe that a large organization will be populated by specialists and in small organizations generalists are predominant , are the ideas presented applicable to both environments ( What ’s good for the goose may not be good for the gander ) ?
Third thought :
How much of the success attributed to the ideas and strategies are because employees feel part of a large important project that has purpose ( Everyone smiles during the parade ) ?
How much of the positive response is because workers feel that leadership is aware and concerned about them and their problems ( I am important , my contribution is important and they know it ) ?
How many of the 25 ideas are related to communication , strategy , customer feedback , cost savings , knowledge of the industry , knowledge of the customer , agility and flexibility …. are n’t all these factors inherent in a small business ?
In fact , without competence in these areas the small business fails quickly .
Perhaps a great idea , number 26 , for big corporations would be to take a look at the core competencies required by successful small business owners , and insure that these specialties and areas of expertise are well represented and disseminated throughout their large organization .

You do n't find new mammals that often , and to do so must be extraordinary
Callum Rankine
See the photos
WWF caught two images of the animal , which is bigger than a domestic cat , dark red , and has a long muscular tail .
Local people , the WWF says , had not seen the species before , and researchers say it looks to be new .
The WWF says there is an urgent need to conserve forests in south - east Asia which are under pressure from logging and the palm oil trade .
The creature , believed to be carnivorous , was spotted in the Kayan Mentarang National Park , which lies in Indonesian territory on Borneo .
The team which discovered it , led by biologist Stephan Wulffraat , is publishing full details in a new book on Borneo and its wildlife .
" You do n't find new mammals that often , and to do so must be extraordinary , " said Callum Rankine , head of the species programme at WWF - UK .
" We 've got camera traps there , which are passive devices relying on infra-red beams across forest paths , " he told the BBC News website .
" Lots of animals come past - it 's much easier than pushing through the forest itself - and when an animal cuts the beam , two cameras catch images from the front and back . "
Not a lemur
The find was made in Kayan Mentarang national park on Borneo
" The photos look most like a lemur , " he told the BBC News website .
" But there certainly should n't be lemurs in Borneo . "
These long - tailed primates are confined to the island of Madagascar .
" It 's more likely to be a viverrid - that 's the family which includes the mongoose and civets - which is a very poorly known group , " Dr Isaac said .
" One of the photos clearly shows the length of the tail and how muscly it is ; civets use their tails to balance in trees , so this new animal may spend chunks of its time up trees too . "
That could be one reason why it has not been spotted before .
Another could be that access to the heart of Borneo is becoming easier as population centres expand and roads are built .
The WWF says this is the heart of the issue .
It accuses the governments of Indonesia and Malaysia , which each own parts of Borneo , of encouraging the loss of native jungle by allowing the development of giant palm oil plantations .
Last week Pehin Sri Haji Abdul Taib Mahmud , chief minister of Sarawak , the larger Malaysian state on Borneo , said that such claims are unfounded and part of a smear campaign .
He told the BBC News website that palm oil plantations are mainly sited on land which had previously been cleared for cultivation or are in " secondary jungle " .
But the WWF says species like the new viverrid - if new viverrid it be - are threatened by such development .
It is concerned that other as yet unknown creatures may go extinct before their existence can be documented .
The group is planning to capture the new species in a live trap so it can be properly studied and described .
In the web development world , anyways .
So , in the grand scheme of things , maybe not a huge deal to anyone else .
Versioning is going to be one of the biggest problems and opportunities there is in web development , and it ’s going to take us at least five years to get it right .
Actually , let me admit up front that five years is a shot in the dark , and optimistic to boot .
If people keep hanging out with bondage and discipline languages like Java and C# that are still catching up to language and framework developments from the 90’s it ’ll take us more like ten years .
( Attention Lisp Weenies :
Yes , I know you solved every problem forty years ago for certain values of “ solved ” and “ problem ” while the rest of us were getting work done . )
Not only is versioning a difficult technical problem , it will be difficult to educate programmers in what it is , how it works , and why you ’ll wish you used about a year after you decided it was too much work .
I ’m writing to get help get the ball rolling on the process of solving this problem and publicizing it .
So maybe it ’s about time I go into what the problem is instead of just yammering on , eh ?
Because your website is served from your machines , you can update it every few days or hours .
This is almost pedantically obvious , but it ’s a big change from having to press CDs , ship them to a store , and wait for them to go home with customers — it ’s even a big change from posting a new version online for customers to download and install .
The web ’s faster pace means that updating , say , your database model to add or remove fields is a common occurence rather than something your InstallShield wizard does every 1 - 2 years .
It ’s vital that changes be streamlined and safeguarded .
What kind of defaults get set when you add fields ?
How do you save data when you lose fields ?
How does the programmer make sure the Right Thing happens ?
If you have the fields Name and Address and want to combine them into a simple MailingAddress field , you ’re not just deleting two columns and adding one .
Not only is it complex to change your schema , getting those changes into production are not easy .
The script that updates definitions and migrates data ( which we tested somewhere other than production , right ? ) needs to placate the multiple web and database servers used for load - balancing .
If you update the database server first , the application code on the web server should n’t break because it did n’t get the word about the new schema .
I see too many problems with trying to get multiple servers to update to a new version at the Exact Same Instant , I think schema changes are going to have to be a four - step process with a backwards - compatible first step applied to the database ( add columns , loosen restrictions ) , a code update ( with testing ! ) , a backwards - incompatible database change ( drop columns , tighten restrictions ) , and finally another code update to remove outdated usage .
Jakob Kaplan - Moss , one of the creators of Django , just opened the discussion of versioning in Django ( with links to prior art ) .
As a web framework with an object - relational mapper , versioning is an important feature .
In addition to databases , web APIs need versioning .
Adam Kelsey has opened that discussion , but so far the solutions are pretty rough and I do n’t have anything to add to the discussion .
If you ’d like to read more about how web development differs from other development , Steve Yegge wrote an excellent article titled It ’s Not Software coining the term “ servware ” to emphasize that web developers need to recognize the ways our code ends up so different .
( It ’s easy to turn this topic into rah - rah “ We ’re so special we do n’t have to learn from history ” bullshit , but nobody wants that . )
Diabetes Treatment Hope
A recent study reveals that islet cell transplantation may decrease the need of insulin injections for people with type 1 diabetes .
complication of diabetes in which people can no longer recognize early symptoms of low blood sugar .

Insulin independence did not persist indefinitely in most cases , and less than a third of the people who had been freed from insulin injections after one year remained so by two years .
However , individuals with functioning islets had improved control of their diabetes , even though they still needed to take insulin shots .
Further research will be needed to improve and prolong the beneficial effects of the procedure , the researchers say .
" Dr. Shapiro and the ITN research team have improved our understanding of the potential of islet transplantation for certain patients with Type 1 diabetes , " says NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci , M.D. " Ongoing studies will further define the clinical utility of this approach . "
" This really shows that islet transplantation can be tremendously successful in protecting against hypoglycemic unawareness , " says Dr. Shapiro .
The easy listening habits of Grantley Richards met with a large police response early yesterday , shutting several Manhattan blocks and causing a brief panic .
The chaos that unfolded on East 67th Street during the morning rush started with a stereo speaker that looked like a bomb .
Eventually , the drama ended up involving Slovakian diplomats , the Japanese ambassador to the United Nations and a robot that fires water projectiles .
When it was all over , Mr. Richards 's minivan , where he has listened to much jazz and some reggae , sat covered in police tape , with most of its windows blown out .
A law enforcement official said it was Mr. Richards 's love of bass that caused the problem .
The police gave this account : About 8 a.m. , Mr. Richards 's minivan , a Mercury Villager , was parked on East 67th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues , outside the residence of the Japanese ambassador to the United Nations .

If you ’re keen to learn more about mastering database management , you may find this recent article on MySQL of great interest .
Whether you want to build your own forum , publish the messages from a mailing list on your Website , or write your own cms : there will be a moment that you ’ll want to store hierarchical data in a database .
And , unless you ’re using a XML - like database , tables are n’t hierarchical ; they ’re just a flat list .
You ’ll have to find a way to translate the hierarchy in a flat file .
Storing trees is a common problem , with multiple solutions .
There are two major approaches : the adjacency list model , and the modified preorder tree traversal algorithm .
In this article , we ’ll explore these two methods of saving hierarchical data .
I ’ll use the tree from a fictional online food store as an example .
This food store organizes its food by category , by colour and by type .
The tree looks like this :
This article contains a number of code examples that show how to save and retrieve data .
Because I use that language myself , and many other people use or know that language too , I chose to write the examples in PHP .
You can probably easily translate them to your own language of choice .
The Adjacency List Model
The first , and most elegant , approach we ’ll try is called the ‘ adjacency list model ’ or the ‘ recursion method ’ .
It ’s an elegant approach because you ’ll need just one , simple function to iterate through your tree .
In our food store , the table for an adjacency list looks like this :
As you can see , in the adjacency list method , you save the ‘ parent ’ of each node .
We can see that ‘ Pear ’ is a child of ‘ Green ’ , which is a child of ‘ Fruit ’ and so on .
The root node , ‘ Food ’ , does n’t have a parent value .
For simplicity , I ’ve used the ‘ title ’ value to identify each node .
Of course , in a real database , you ’d use the numerical id of each node .
Give Me the Tree
Now that we ’ve inserted our tree in the database , it ’s time to write a display function .
This function will have to start at the root node — the node with no parent — and should then display all children of that node .
For each of these children , the function should retrieve and display all the child nodes of that child .
For these children , the function should again display all children , and so on .
As you might have noticed , there ’s a regular pattern in the description of this function .
We can simply write one function , which retrieves the children of a certain parent node .
That function should then start another instance of itself for each of these children , to display all their children .
This is the recursive mechanism that gives the ‘ recursion method ’ its name .
<? php
// $ parent is the parent of the children we want to see
// $ level is increased when we go deeper into the tree ,
// used to display a nice indented tree
function display_children ( $ parent , $ level ) {
// retrieve all children of $ parent
$ result = mysql_query ( ' SELECT title FROM tree '.
' WHERE parent= " '.$ parent . ' " ; ' ) ;
// display each child
while ( $row = mysql_fetch_array ( $ result ) ) {
// indent and display the title of this child
echo str_repeat ( ' ' , $ level ) . $row [ ' title ' ] . " n " ;
// call this function again to display this
// child 's children
display_children ( $row [ ' title ' ] , $ level +1 ) ;
}
}
?>
To display our whole tree , we ’ll run the function with an empty string as $ parent and $ level = 0 : display_children ( ' ',0 ) ;
For our food store tree , the function returns :
Food
Fruit
Red
Cherry
Yellow
Banana
Meat
Beef
Pork
Note that if you just want to see a subtree , you can tell the function to start with another node .
For example , to display the ‘ Fruit ’ subtree , you would run display_children ( ' Fruit ' , 0 ) ;
The Path to a Node
With almost the same function , it ’s possible to look up the path to a node if you only know the name or id of that node .
For instance , the path to ‘ Cherry ’ is ‘ Food ’ > ‘ Fruit ’ > ‘ Red ’ .
To get this path , our function will have to start at the deepest level : ‘ Cherry ’ .
It then looks up the parent of this node and adds this to the path .
In our example , this would be ‘ Red ’ .
If we know that ‘ Red ’ is the parent of ‘ Cherry ’ , we can calculate the path to ‘ Cherry ’ by using the path to ‘ Red ’ .
And that ’s given by the function we ’ve just used : by recursively looking up parents , we ’ll get the path to any node in the tree .
<? php
// $ node is the name of the node we want the path of
function get_path ( $ node ) {
// look up the parent of this node
$ result = mysql_query ( ' SELECT parent FROM tree '.
' WHERE title= " '.$ node . ' " ; ' ) ;
$ row = mysql_fetch_array ( $ result ) ;
// save the path in this array
$ path = array ( ) ;
// only continue if this $ node is n't the root node
// ( that 's the node with no parent )
if ( $row [ ' parent ' ] !='' ) {
// the last part of the path to $ node , is the name
// of the parent of $ node
$ path [ ] = $ row [ ' parent ' ] ;
// we should add the path to the parent of this node
// to the path
$ path = array_merge ( get_path ( $ row [ ' parent ' ] ) , $ path ) ;
}
// return the path
return $ path ;
}
?>
This function now returns the path to a given node .
It returns that path as an array , so to display the path we can use print_r ( get_path ( ' Cherry ' ) ) ;
If you do this for ‘ Cherry ’ , you ’ll see :
Array
(
[ 0 ] =>
Food
[ 1 ] => Fruit
[ 2 ] =>
Red
)
Disadvantages
As we ’ve just seen , this is a great method .
It ’s easy to understand , and the code we need is simple , too .
What then , are the downsides of the adjacency list model ?
In most programming languages , it ’s slow and inefficient .
This is mainly caused by the recursion .
We need one database query for each node in the tree .
As each query takes some time , this makes the function very slow when dealing with large trees .
The second reason this method is n’t that fast , is the programming language you ’ll probably use .
Unlike languages such as Lisp , most languages are n’t designed for recursive functions .
For each node , the function starts another instance of itself .
So , for a tree with four levels , you ’ll be running four instances of the function at the same time .
As each function occupies a slice of memory and takes some time to initiate , recursion is very slow when applied to large trees .

FOR the past three years , the most successful shows on American television have been “ American Idol ” and “ The Apprentice ” .
This spring , millions tuned in to watch Carrie Underwood , a 21 - year - old country - and - western singer from small - town Oklahoma , win the entertainment contest and to see Bill Rancic , who put himself through university by cleaning boats , land a six - figure salary as Donald Trump 's chosen sidekick .
The success of these shows in America testifies to the endurance and popularity of the American Dream — the idea that anything is possible if you work at it hard enough .
America 's founding document declares all men to be created equal .
From Benjamin Franklin , the 15th child of a candlemaker , to Bill Clinton , whose mother was widowed before he was born , the American creed proclaims that the ladder of success can be climbed by all .
A decline in social mobility would run counter to Americans ' deepest beliefs about their country .
Unfortunately , that is what seems to be happening .
Class is reappearing in a new form .
For the quarter - century after the second world war , income growth in America was fairly evenly spread .
According to a study by the Economic Policy Institute ( EPI ) , the poorest fifth of the population saw its income increase by as much as the next - poorest fifth , and so on in equal steps to the top .
But in the past quarter - century , the rich have been doing dramatically better than the less well off .
Since 1979 , median family incomes have risen by 18 % but the incomes of the top 1 % have gone up by 200 % .
In 1970 , according to the Census Bureau , the bottom fifth received 5.4 % of America 's total national income and the richest fifth got 40.9 % .
Twenty - five years later , the share of the bottom fifth had fallen to 4.4 % but that of the top fifth had risen to 46.5 % .
A harder climb
This makes America unusual .
Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez examined the incomes of the top 0.1 % of people in America , France and Britain from 1913 to 1998 .
The fortunes of the three countries ' super - rich kept fairly closely in step for most of the 20th century , until America began to diverge in the late 1970s .
Now the top 0.1 % of Americans earn two or three times as much as their peers in Britain and France ( see chart 6 ) .
If America is a ladder , the rungs have been moved further apart .
Perhaps Americans think the rich deserve their success .
They certainly work more than they used to .
In the 1970s , the top 10 % worked fewer hours than the bottom 10 % ; now the reverse is true .
Back in 1929 , 70 % of the income of the extremely rich ( the top 0.01 % ) came from capital ( dividends , rent and interest ) .
Now , 80 % comes from wages and stock options , which is earned income of a sort .
Or perhaps what really matters is how the poor are doing in absolute terms rather than in relation to the wealthy .
Americans ' average salaries have risen over the past 30 years , though admittedly not by much .
A far smaller share of the population lives in poverty now than in the supposedly golden age of equality in the 1950s ( 12 % compared with 22 % ) .
Moreover , a surge of immigrants on minimum wages tends to bring down the average : home - grown Americans are probably better off than the figures suggest .
The rich have not got richer at the expense of the poor .
The rising tide has lifted dinghies as well as yachts .
Anyway , what Americans seem to mind about most is equality of opportunity — and people do not feel there is any less of it now than there used to be .
Some 80 % ( a higher proportion than in the 1980s ) think it is possible to start out poor , work hard and become rich .
A poll for the New York Times found that twice as many Americans reckon that their chances of moving up a notch have improved over the past 30 years than think their chances have gone down .
Most Americans say their standard of living is higher than that of their parents , and that their children will do better than they are doing .
So , on the face of it , rising inequality is not affecting the optimism and ambition of average Americans , and these are what matter to the country 's entrepreneurial spirit and social cohesion .
But there are three big problems with this rosy view .
The first is that America has never been as socially mobile as Americans like to believe .
According to a long - term research project carried out at the University of Michigan , led by Gary Solon , America 's score on social mobility is not particularly high or low , but middling .
That does not sound too bad .
But it means that , if you are among the poorest 5 % of the population , your chances of achieving an average income are only one in six .
If you are among the poorest 1 % , they become very dim indeed .
Moreover — and this was the most surprising thing about the study — despite America 's more flexible labour markets , social mobility there is no longer greater than in supposedly class - ridden Europe , and if anything it seems to be declining .
A study by Katharine Bradbury and Jane Katz for the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston found that in the 1970s , 65 % of people changed their social position ( that is , moved out of the income bracket in which they had started the decade ) .
In the 1990s , only 60 % did .
Not a huge change , but consistent with Mr Solon 's study showing that the correlation between parents ' and children 's income is even closer now than it was in the 1980s .
The authors also found decreasing amounts of social mobility at the top and the bottom .
This is squeezing the middle class .
Americans may be sorting themselves into two more stable groups , haves and have - nots .
This is the same trend that geographical mobility has been encouraging .
Decreasing mobility may one day come to erode Americans ' faith in the fairness of their economy .
The second reason for pessimism is that mobility may continue to decline because it is rooted in fundamental changes to the economy .
These explain both the big rise in income inequality and the smaller shift in social mobility .
Over the past 25 years , globalisation has increased rewards for intellectual skills , pushing up the value of a degree .
The income gap between college graduates and those without university degrees doubled between 1979 and 1997 .
This has gone hand in hand with changes in the nature of work .
It used to be possible to start at the bottom of a big firm and work your way up .
But America 's corporate giants have got rid of their old hierarchies .
Lifetime employment is at an end , and managers hop from job to job .
That makes a degree essential .
In the 1930s and 1940s , only half of all American chief executives had a college degree .
Now almost all of them do , and 70 % also have a higher degree , such as an MBA .
People with a university degree are now more likely to move up an income bracket than those without .
This is a big change since the 1970s , when income rises were distributed equally across all educational levels .
America is becoming a stratified society based on education : a meritocracy .
But what if education itself becomes stratified ?
Historically , America 's education system has been the main avenue for upward mobility .
Mass secondary education supplied the workforce of the world 's most successful industrial economy in the late 19th century ; mass university education did the same for the period of American economic dominance after the second world war .
But now , worries Lawrence Summers , the president of Harvard University , what had been engines of social mobility risk becoming brakes .
At secondary - school level , American education is financed largely by local property taxes .
Naturally , places with big houses paying larger property taxes have schools with more resources .
At university level , the rise in the cost of education has taken Ivy League universities out of the reach of most middle - class and poor families .
The median income of families with children at Harvard is $ 150,000 .
The wealthy have always dominated elite schools , but their representation is rising .
Between 1976 and 1995 , according to one study , students from the richest quarter of the population increased their share of places at America 's elite universities from 39 % to 50 % .
Even outside elite schools , students from poor backgrounds are becoming rarer .
The budget squeeze on states in 2001 - 04 forced them to increase fees at state colleges , traditionally the places where the children of less wealthy parents went .
Those children also face increasing competition from richer kids squeezed out of the Ivy League .
As a result , a student from the top income quarter is six times more likely to get a BA than someone from the bottom quarter .
American schools seem to be reinforcing educational differences rather than reducing them .
The third reason for gloom is perhaps the most worrying .
It is the possibility that , as Isabel Sawhill of the Brookings Institution argues , your chances of a good education , good job and good prospects — in other words , of moving upwards — are partly determined by family behaviour .
On this view , the rich really are different , and not just because they have more money ; moreover , these differences are becoming embedded in the structure of the family itself .
Class stratification , in other words , is more than a matter of income or inherited wealth .
College graduates tend to marry college graduates .
Both go out to work , so in the households of the most educated the returns to a university education are doubled .
College - educated women are also postponing children for the sake of their careers .
On average , they have their first child at 30 , five years later than in the 1970s and eight years later than their contemporaries who have not been to college .
The trouble with being poor
At the bottom of the heap , you see the opposite : women have children younger , often out of wedlock and without a job .
True , out - of - wedlock births are falling and welfare reform has increased the chances of mothers holding down jobs , but the gap is still vast .
If , as Ms Sawhill argues , the key to upward mobility is finishing your education , having a job and getting and staying married , then the rich start with advantages beyond money .
This does not mean that America 's meritocracy is a fake , or that nothing can be done .
The country faced a similar rise in inequality in the early 20th century and rallied against it .
President Roosevelt sought to save American capitalism from its own excesses so that “ malefactors of great wealth ” would not become a hereditary aristocracy .
Today , policy changes , such as reforming the way schools are financed , or giving federal help to poorer college students , would lessen social inequality .
But for that to happen , American politicians and the public must first acknowledge that there is a problem .
At the moment , they do not .
All Things Pythonic
Web Framework Redux
by Guido van van Rossum
January 30 , 2006
Summary
This is an interim response to the discussion that followed my previous web frameworks blog .
I need to do much more research , but I have some quick thoughts .
Advertisement
Let me thank everybody for participating in the web frameworks discussion .
I have n't been able to digest all the comments yet , and I 've yet to download a single one of the many recommendations ( except for web.py , because it was only one file ) .
But I 've skimmed a lot of the discussion , and tried to follow a few tutorials ( many of which are unfinished , leaving me with an unsatisfied cliffhanger feeling ) .
So , while I educate myself more ( and take care of other duties ) , here are some thoughts that are bubbling through my head at this point .
Maybe the current crop of Python web frameworks ( as well as Rails BTW ) have it all wrong .
Maybe the WSGI folks are the only ones who are " getting " it .
ISTM that , contrary to what Rails and its many imitators seem to think , a framework should n't be an all - or - nothing proposition .
For example , in the case of my Google starter project , I need to roll my own solutions for authentication and persistence ( since these must hook into internal Google infrastructure ) , but I really need a better templating approach than % ( name ) s .
So I should be able to use Django 's templates , or Cheetah .
I really want to look into Cheetah -- the example I saw on web.py looks " right " .
( web.py itself OTOH gets an " F " , for undocumented code with too much magic behavior .
upvars ( ) , bah . )
Maybe we need more standardization efforts like WSGI , that let you plug in different animals , or roll your own , for various pieces of useful web functionality : for example URL dispatch , templates , persistence , authentication , sessions , forms , style sheets , i18n , and client - side scripting ( AJAX or not ) .
Not that I 'm particular keen on WSGI -- it reminds me of a trip to East Berlin in the mid ' 80s .
But its point is to provide a minimal interface between the web server and the typical web application , and to support most existing solutions on both side of the fence .
The former is the real point , of course , but the latter is extremely important for standardization efforts .
( Remember ISO networking ?
No ?
See , that proves my point . :-)
Here 's another point .
Or perhaps a set of chaotically related points .
Some frameworks emphasize that the effort of getting started is low .
But this is really only so to the extent that you 're trying to do something very similar to something that 's been done a 1000 times before , so that all the defaults in the framework and the setup utilities are all doing exactly what 's needed .
This ( and very fast typing ) is what makes the first Rails movie possible .
But what if you need to into an existing authentication framework ?
What if you need to hook into an existing database schema that maps to in - memory objects in a different way than the framework 's ORM tool ?
Or if your persistence approach is not based on a relational database at all ?
What if you want to write an AJAX application like Google Maps or Gmail ?
Etc. -- for every framework component there 's an alternative that you might want or need to use instead of the default .
I remember the time , before the web , when GUI apps were new .
We were all learning about event handling , scrolling regions , screen refresh , window placement , text editing , and so on .
Soon enough , frameworks emerged that took care of the repetitive stuff , leaving the application developer free to develop an application .
But IMO it did n't work all that well .
Perhaps it worked well for some apps , that really were very similar to the " ur- application " that the framework designers had in mind .
But usually the framework did n't do exactly what you wanted , and then you had to tell it to do things differently .
Perhaps you did n't want a horizontal scroll bar on that window .
Perhaps you did n't want to automatically change the cursor to an hourglass for certain operations .
Or perhaps you did n't want windows at all !
Let the whole screen be a canvas .
Etc. , etc .
For many applications , the choice was between either using a GUI framework and writing lots of overrides to fight ( some would say " extend " ) the framework ; or using a more simplistic , lower - level GUI toolkit and writing more low - level code but being more in control .
Which approach was the quicklest way to success was n't always clear , but here 's my take : personally , I 'd rather use a bottom - up approach , where I can start writing simple code that forms the core of my app , without relying on framework services .
Then as I find the need for templates , authentication , sessions , persistence and so on , libraries should be available to do the heavy lifting .
Perhaps frameworks could fit the role of " profiles " -- a set of libraries that is necessary and sufficient for a particular type of application .
For example , there could be a profile suitable for building social networking sites , one for setting up on - line stores , one for enterprise intranet applications , one for community websites and so on .
These would have different levels of sophistication , and different number of components , but there would be a considerable amount of overlap ( e.g. the on - line store profile and the enterprise intranet profile may both provide session management out of the box ) .
I 'm halfway through Joel Spolski's book , User Interface Design for Programmers .
It 's a great , light read ( and a great companion to Steve Krug 's Don't Make Me Think ) .
Joel notices a pendumum swing in UI design paradigms : from classic power - apps that give you an empty window and a loaded menu bar , to auto - content - creation wizards focused on specific likely activities that leave the expert frustrated , and back again to a more reasonable mid point .
Perhaps WSGI represents the " blank slate " approach ; Rails / Django represent the wizard approach ; I 'm still looking for the ideal mix - and - match solution .
From this perspective , Zope and Twisted are off the scale : they support the mix - and - match approach , offering several alternative solutions for many of the important issues ( templating , persistence , authentication , etc. ) .
But they only work if you drink lavish quantities of their particular flavor of kool - aid , and that 's not good enough for me .
I do n't want to depend on any particular flavor of interfaces , adaptation , serialization , discovery , etc .
I 'm looking for solutions that depend only on the Python standard library , and use accepted Python idioms and patterns .
Any takers ?

Apple today admitted that its new iPod Nano was subject to battery failure and scratched screens .
The electronics giant confirmed reports that the critically - acclaimed music player suffered from " unexpected failures " in its colour screen , and has offered a free replacement to all customers affected by faulty Nanos .
Apple refused to admit any problems with the small and sleek units after they were launched earlier this month , but an increasing number of complaints about the LCD screens forced today 's climbdown .
One disgruntled Nano owner , Matthew Peterson , was so frustrated with the problems that he set up the website flawedmusicplayer.com , on which he invited other Nano owners to share their experiences and posted pictures of cracked screens .
The Nano has proved so popular that the high street retailer Dixons is reportedly selling five every minute .
However , an investigation by BBC's Watchdog programme revealed that customers were not being told that the rechargeable batteries used in most of the portable music players had a limited life span .
Last night , Apple acknowledged there was a problem with one particular shipment of Nanos , offering customers either a full refund or a replacement .
However , the company has not disclosed how many of the units have been affected , saying it was only " a tiny fraction " of the amount already sold .
" The iPod Nano screen - cracking problem is a real but minor issue involving a vendor quality problem in a small number of units , " Phil Schiller , an Apple spokesman , said .
" It has affected less than one tenth of 1 % of the total iPod Nano units we have shipped so far . "
Apple says any customer with a defective screen should contact AppleCare and it will be replaced free of charge .
The cost of replacing faulty units normally falls to the retailer .
Mr Schiller said the Nano screen was made of the same material as Apple 's white fourth generation iPod , which had attracted no complaints about scratching .
" We have received very few calls from customers reporting this problem - we do not think this is a widespread issue , " he said .
" If customers are concerned about scratching , we suggest they use one of the many iPod Nano cases to protect their iPod . "
Mr Peterson this morning posted a response to Apple 's admission on his site .
" I am very delighted to see Apple take this issue seriously , " he said .
" It is sad that it took a website and a lot of publicity before they finally investigated , but at least future Nano users with the same problem I had will not be subjected to the same treatment that I was .
Thank you , Apple . "
The Nano resembles the iPod Shuffle , the small music player released earlier this year , but has a screen , weighs just 42g and comes in two different capacities .
The cheapest unit , which costs £ 140 , can store up to 500 songs .
The next model costs £ 180 and stores 1,000 songs or 25,000 photographs .
Steve Jobs , the head of Apple , launched the Nano during a press conference at the beginning of the month when he pulled a unit out of his pocket and said : " It 's impossibly small . "

I like to think of myself as an open - minded person , someone who is tolerant of those with different beliefs , however wacky they may seem to me .
Every rule has its exceptions , though .
Years ago while traveling in England , I met a woman who claimed her diet consisted solely of durian , the smelly tropical fruit that looks like a medieval weapon .
That was weird , but I was prepared to overlook it ; I ’ve heard of stranger things .
During the course of our discussion about food , however , the woman asked if I ’d heard of edible gold .
I cheerfully replied that I had , which was true — I ’d seen a TV show years earlier about chefs using gold leaf as a decorative but edible garnish on dishes in upscale restaurants .
I assumed that ’s what she was talking about .
But she seemed very surprised that I should know about this , and in a hushed , conspiratorial tone , began excitedly talking about how the ancient Egyptians had discovered that by eating powdered gold , one could become immortal .
Very clearly , she believed this too .
O…K . Right then and there , all my good intentions of open - mindedness went out the window — that was just way too strange for me to get my brain around .
Later , when I consulted a search engine to see if I could learn any more about this seemingly outrageous claim , I was shocked and dismayed to find there are tens of thousands of webpages describing , with great seriousness and credulity , a miraculous substance usually referred to as white powder ( or powdered ) gold .
I spent the better part of an afternoon trying to sort out all the bizarre and competing claims about this stuff — a futile exercise that left me scratching my head .
While I ca n’t claim the slightest expertise in this , ahem , esoteric field , I thought I ’d make an attempt to distill , in my alchemical way , the essence of some of these claims for your consideration .
All That Glitters
Let ’s begin on some solid footing : culinary gold .
You can easily find , often for less than US $ 10 , a box of gold leaf ( sheets , flakes , or sprinkles ) manufactured expressly to enable you to impress your friends at your next dinner party .
These unbelievably thin pieces of nearly pure gold add an impressive touch to chocolates , soups , sushi , and just about anything else you can think of .
Because the quantity of gold is so small , the price is not unreasonable ; yet these gold highlights make a meal appear to be extravagant and give restaurants an excuse to charge exorbitant prices .
And yes : it ’s safe to eat ( if not particularly flavorful ) .
Metallic gold is biologically inert ; that ’s why dentists can use it for fillings , caps , and crowns .
( Gold salts , on the other hand , such as auric chloride , can have toxic effects over time . )
Some purveyors of herbs and mineral supplements sell a gold colloid : that is , a suspension of extremely tiny particles of metallic gold in water or another liquid — or solid pills made from such a suspension .
In a gold colloid , each particle contains ( according to one source , at least ) a mere nine atoms or so of gold .
A daily dose of colloidal gold ranging from a few drops to a few teaspoonfuls is supposedly enough to provide a wide range of health benefits .
Here , at least , there is a wee bit of scientific support .
A few studies performed at the behest ( and expense ) of a gold colloid manufacturer found their product to be effective in managing rheumatoid arthritis and also , intriguingly , increasing I.Q. scores in their test subjects .
I ’d have greater confidence in independent testing , but the claims are at least plausible .
Fool ’s Gold
Our next step , however , is one decidedly outside the realm of scientific certainty .
David Radius Hudson , a farmer living in Arizona , was trying to extract gold and silver from the tailings of an abandoned mine in the mid-1970s .
In the process , he found a mysterious substance that defied analysis , despite years of experimentation by reputable laboratories , undertaken at great personal expense .
Here the details get very fuzzy , but it seems that Hudson eventually concluded the white powder he ’d found was gold in a monatomic ( or , as he called it , monoatomic ) state , in which each atom was physically separate from all others , rather than being joined in molecular groups as is more common .
( There are some good reasons to doubt that Hudson ’s gold truly was monatomic , but that ’s neither here nor there . )
He also , somehow , developed a process for creating ( or separating ) this special form of gold from ordinary metallic gold — though how he managed to figure this out without any scientific training is unclear .
In any case , this white powder gold , according to Hudson , has some rather amazing properties : it is allegedly a high - temperature superconductor and , when heated in just the right way , weighs less than nothing — it can levitate .
And , of course , it has a long list of incredible health benefits .
Hudson received patents in Britain and Australia ( though not , interestingly , in the U.S. ) for this special form of gold and 10 other elements , which he referred to collectively as Orbitally Rearranged Monoatomic Elements ( ORMEs ) .
( I should interject that the awarding of a patent does not mean that a government agency has successfully reproduced the invention in question , or even that they have validated it as being scientifically sound . )
Then Hudson began reading about alchemy , and he became convinced that his white powder gold was the stuff of legend — well , many legends , in fact .
He equated it with “ manna , ” “ the philosopher ’s stone , ” “ the food of the gods , ” and “ the elixir of life , ” among other things .
Hudson believed he had rediscovered an ancient alchemical formula .
He began promoting this belief in New Age and mystical circles , which eagerly latched onto it and have been proclaiming it as truth ever since .
And , naturally , numerous companies sell solid or liquid forms of “ white powder gold ” supposedly created using variants of Hudson ’s recipe .
Hard to Swallow
Needless to say , consumers have to take the composition of this substance on faith .
Maybe it really is monatomic gold , maybe not .
But if it is , so what ?
That does n’t make it magical … and it certainly does n’t make it the philosopher ’s stone .
You ’d think claims of room - temperature superconductivity could be tested readily enough , and that if true , they would be headline news .
You ’d think a substance that possesses anti-gravity capabilities would attract some scientific attention .
And you ’d think that if this substance had any meaningful health benefits — let alone the promise of an indefinite lifespan — researchers would be tripping over themselves trying to demonstrate this in objective studies , the better to sell more of the stuff and benefit all of humanity .
Curiously , none of this appears to be the case .
Hudson himself , meanwhile , has reportedly halted his research , partly due to heart disease — an ailment apparently beyond the healing capabilities of his magical elixir — and partly due financial troubles as the result of actions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that he considered harassment .
Whatever else can be said about white powder gold , I can testify that it has the magical power to give me a headache — merely by reading about it .

XPath 1.0 in JavaScript
Here is an implementation of XPath 1.0 in JavaScript .
It 's not completely tested but it seems to work with the few tests I 've been doing .
It is released under a Creative Commons Licence .
Please let me know if there are any bugs .
There is a mailing list for discussing the library .
You can subscribe by going to the list information page .
The archives are also available .
A simple example of how to use it :
// Create a new parser object var parser = new XPathParser ( ) ; //
Parse the XPath expression var xpath = parser.parse ( " count(//svg:rect ) " ) ; // Create a context for the XPath to be evaluated in var context = new XPathContext ( ) ; context.expressionContextNode = document.documentElement ; // Evaluate the XPath expression var result = xpath.evaluate ( context ) ; // Display the result window.alert ( " There " + ( result == 1 ? " is " : " are " ) + result +
" SVG rect elements in the document . " ) ;
The XPathContext constructor takes three arguments : a VariableResolver , a NamespaceResolver and a FunctionResolver .
If these are not specified then default objects will be used .
The default VariableResolver will not resolve any variables .
The default NamespaceResolver will resolve namespaces based on the expression 's context node .
The default FunctionResolver resolves only the core XPath functions .
Here is an example using custom resolvers :
// MyVariableResolver MyVariableResolver.prototype = new VariableResolver ( ) ; MyVariableResolver.prototype.constructor = MyVariableResolver ; MyVariableResolver.superclass = VariableResolver.prototype ; function MyVariableResolver ( ) { } MyVariableResolver.prototype.getVariableWithName = function ( ns , ln , c ) { if ( ns == null && ln == " doc " ) { //
Make the $ doc variable return a nodeset containing the // document element .
var ns = new XNodeSet ( ) ; ns.add(c.contextNode.ownerDocument.documentElement ) ; return ns ; } return null ; } ; // MyNamespaceResolver MyNamespaceResolver.prototype = new NamespaceResolver ( ) ; MyNamespaceResolver.prototype.constructor = MyNamespaceResolver ; MyNamespaceResolver.superclass = NamespaceResolver.prototype ; function MyNamespaceResolver ( ) { } MyNamespaceResolver.prototype.getNamespace = function ( prefix , n ) { //
Always resolve the prefix " ex " . if ( prefix == " ex " ) { return " http://example.org/functions " ; } return this.superclass.getNamespace( prefix , n ) ; } ; // Extension function var doubleString = function ( ) { //
Extension functions always have the XPathContext as the first // argument . var c = arguments [ 0 ] ; if ( arguments.length !=
2 ) { throw new Error ( " Function ex:double - string expects ( string ) " ) ; } //
We take the first real argument to the extension function , // evaluate it , and get its string value .
var s = arguments [ 1].evaluate(c).stringValue ( ) ; //
Then we return a new string object for the doubled string .
return new XString(s + s ) ; } ; var varRes = new MyVariableResolver ( ) ; var nsRes = new MyNamespaceResolver ( ) ; var funRes = new FunctionResolver ( ) ; funRes.addFunction ( " http://example.org/functions " , " double - string " , doubleString ) ; var parser = new XPathParser ( ) ; var context = new XPathContext ( varRes , nsRes , funRes ) ; var xpath = new XPath ( " ex:double-string ( $doc / @width ) " ) ; var result = xpath.evaluate( context ) ;
Evaluating an XPath expression will return an object of class XBoolean , XNumber , XString or XNodeSet .
All four of these classes have methods called booleanValue , numberValue and stringValue to convert them to JavaScript types .
The XNodeSet class has a toArray method which will return an array containing the DOM nodes in that nodeset .
Because the XPath data model treats adjacent text nodes and CDATA sections as a single text node , expressions working on documents which have such adjacent text nodes may not evaluate correctly .
There is a utility function included to coalesce all adjacent text nodes in a document to avoid this problem .
Utilities.coalesceText( document ) ;
Since revision 18 , the script includes DOM 3 XPath support .
Including the script will attempt to install the XPathEvaluator functions on the current document ( the one named by the global ' document ' variable ) , if XPath support is not already available .
This is not guaranteed to work in all DOM implementations , since the document object is a host object , and host objects need not store any extra properties .
However , it works at least in Internet Explorer , Opera and Mozilla ( though Mozilla already has DOM 3 XPath support ) .
The DOM 3 XPath support can be installed on any document object , with a call to the installDOM3XPathSupport function :
installDOM3XPathSupport ( myDoc , new XPathParser ( ) ) ;
The function must be given an XPathParser object that will be used for all XPath parsing .

The use of controversial new security powers intended to protect Parliament to prosecute a peace campaigner has been condemned in the Commons today .
Maya Anne Evans , a 25 - year - old cook , became the first person to be prosecuted under the law which bans unauthorised demonstrations within one kilometre of Westminster after reciting the names of British soldiers killed in Iraq outside the gates of Downing Street .
David Heath , for Liberal Democrats , demanded an urgent debate on the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 after its use to convict Miss Evans yesterday .
Commons Leader Geoff
Hoon said the legislation was widely supported by MPs and had worked " remarkably well " since coming into effect last summer .
He added that challenges to such laws were a key part of the democratic tradition but often resulted in criminal penalties .
Miss Evans , 25 , received a criminal conviction for defying the new law .
She was found guilty of breaching Section 132 of the Act , given a conditional discharge and ordered to pay £ 100 towards costs .
The vegan cook from Hastings , Sussex , was arrested on October 25 as she stood next to the Cenotaph , outside Downing Street , reading out the names of 97 British soldiers killed in Iraq .
Her fellow campaigner Milan Rai , 40 , was reading out the names of dead Iraqi civilians and was also arrested .
Bow Street Magistrates ' Court in London heard that the pair conducted a peaceful " remembrance ceremony " and had intended ring a bell for each name read out .
During exchanges on future business today , Mr Heath said of the Act : " ( It ) was sold to us on the basis that it was to prevent terrorist acts against this House and has now been used to convict a young lady , Maya Evans , for reading out a list of British soldiers killed in action in Iraq by the Cenotaph . "
His comments were greeted with a shouts of " disgraceful " from Tories .
Could Wilmer Valderrama 's unlikely charms be at work on yet another unsuspecting young Hollywood starlet ?
And just whose hand is it that 's draped slinkily around Wilmer 's neck ?
More on the hand in a minute .
The former sitcom star was seen cavorting in the Hamptons with none other than 21 - year - old Scarlett Johansson at his side .
TMZ spies spotted the pair on Monday night early on at Stereo House , and then later at celeb - boite Star Room , where Wilmer was hosting the 10th anniversary of a party called , somewhat dubiously , " Back Door Bambi . "
Though TMZ 's eyes and ears did n't notice any canoodling between Valderrama and Johansson , the pair did seem to stay very close to one another most of the evening , and were noticeably camera - and query - shy .
Nonetheless , the ex-Fez , who 's had well - publicized ( and fondly - remembered ) dalliances with Lindsay Lohan , Mandy Moore , and others , appears to have a diverse array of beauties within his reach : a natural blonde ( Scarlett ) , a darker brunette , and another brunette , whose presence Scarlett does n't seem to sanction enthusiastically .

It ’s sad to say but many recent events ( Google Search Subpoena , AOL ’s BIG Mistake , etc ) make it very clear that online your privates are not private anymore .
I mean , do you really want people to know your secret love of fairies ?
Or worse ?
As disturbing , funny , and nutty some of those searches are one thing is pretty clear — people ran them in private .
Or thought they did anyway .
More disturbing is that the entire web is now reading about them , blogging them , doing news stories on them .
So much for privacy .
Luckily , you can go a long way to keeping your secret searches safe .
Here ’s a few tools that will help :
Lost In The Crowd
This site allows you to search your favorite engines while automatically mixing your searches with a large number of other searches essentially creating “ search noise ” .
The idea is that that your sexy / sneaky / sick searches will be harder to find and appear less prominent if they are found .
Nice that it works with any browser and all major engines .
TrackMeNot FireFox Extention
This extention does pretty much the same thing as Lost In The Crowd .
One bit that TrackMeNot has over Lost In The Crowd is that you can add your own list of keywords for the autogenerated searches to be created from which should add a little more safety .
Tor
Creates a network of onion proxies allowing all data ( not just searches ) to flow through what is essentially an anonymous peer to peer network .
I ’m not the most techy guy in the world so if that description does n’t do it for you here ’s a great overview of how Tor works ( scroll down a bit to the pics ) .
Appears to be the most robust solution , but a bit complicated for people like me .
FoxyProxy FireFox Extention
This extention can be configured to use a multiple proxies to help keep everything you do online ( including your searches ) do anonymous .
Works with Tor out of the box .
Do n’t Leave Traces FireFox / Greasemonkey Extention
This new one is similar to FoxyProxy although a little more simplistic since it uses only one proxy and works for searches only .
Easy add though if you already use Greasemonkey .
Use a Web - Based Proxy
There are 100s of free proxies out there that you can use to surf the web .
Most should give you some level of anonymity and work in any browser , but be careful since you never know who is running the proxy !
Ok , I said 6 but you should give the tool that Bob recommends to delete your search history a try or check out our post on clearing your search history too !
Hopefully these tools will help you improve your level of privacy online .
Now you can go fairy hunting in peace
Did I miss any good tools ?
Got a tip for using any of the above ?
Add it to the comments of this post and I ’ll update as needed .
A friend of mine called me yesterday to ask for my opinions on the fact that Meebo just got a few million dollars in funding .
For those not in the know , Meebo is an AJAX version of Trillian .
And what is Trillian ?
It 's an instant messaging client that supports AIM , ICQ , MSN , Yahoo Messenger , and IRC .
In his post How Much Did Meebo Get ?
Om Malik asks
Here is the rub :
Since the company basically aggregates all four major IM networks in a browser , all the four major IM owners - AMYG are out of the acquisition game .
One of them buys the company , the others shut down access to their respective networks .
The very quality that makes Meebo attractive to end - users will make it difficult for them to be acquired .
But there is one option : eBay .
When all fails , you know who to call .
Skype did .
Interactive Corp is another long shot , but they are bargain hunters not premium payers .
Regarding acquisitions , there are three reasons why one of the major players would buy a company ; users , technology and people .
Unless the start up is in a brand new market that the major player is n't playing in , buying a company for its users is usually not the case .
This is because big players like Google , Yahoo ! and Microsoft usually either have orders of magnitude more users than the average ' popular ' startup or could get just as many or more users when they ship a rival service .
The more common reason for a big player like Microsoft or Yahoo !
buying a company is for exclusive technology / IP and for the development team .
Yahoo !
buying del.icio.us or Flickr is n't about getting access to the 250,000 - 300,000 users of these services given that they have less users than the least popular services on Yahoo ! 's network .
Instead it 's about getting people like Joshua Schachter , Caterina Fake and Stewart Butterfield building the next generation of Yahoo ! 's products .
Don Dodge covers this in slightly more detail in his post Microsoft will acquire my company .
Let 's talk about Meebo specifically .
The user base is too small to be a factor so the interesting things are the technology and the people .
First we should look at the technology .
An AJAX instant messaging client is n't novel and companies like Microsoft have been providing one for years .
A framework built on reverse engineering IM protocols is cool but not useful .
As Om Malik points out , the major players tolerate activities like companies like Meebo & Trillian because it is counterproductive for [ example ] AOL suing a tiny company like Trillian for misusing its network .
On the other hand , they would n't tolerate it from a major player like Microsoft primarily because that becomes a significant amount of traffic on their network and licensing access becomes a valid revenue generating scenario .
Thus , the technology is probably not worth a great deal to one of the big players .
That leaves the people , according to the Meebo team page there are three people ; a server dev , a DHTML / AJAX dev and a business guy ( likely to be useless overhead in an acquisition ) .
The question then is how many million dollars would Google , Yahoo ! or Microsoft think is worth for the skills of both [ most likely excellent ] developers ?
Then you have to factor in the markup because the company got VC funding ...
You can probably tell that I agree with Om Malik that it is unlikely that this company would be of interest to any of the four major IM players .
If you are building a Web startup with the intention of flipping it to one of the majors , only three things matter ; technology / IP , users and
the quality of your technical team .
Repeatedly ask yourself : would Microsoft want our users ?
would Google want our technology ?
would Yahoo ! want our people ?
It 's as simple as that .
But I forgot why , about a decade ago , I came to hate vast wealth in the first place .
I 'll get to the explanation some other day .
At any rate , though , I was reminded two weeks ago .
Like so many other people , I was disgusted to see that the poorest and neediest of New Orleans ' residents were
Here 's one tale of horror :
Denise said she thought she was in hell .
they were there for 2 days , with no water , no food .
no shelter .
Denise , her mother ( 63 years old ) , her niece ( 21 years old ) , and 2 - year - old grandniece .
when they arrived , there were already thousands of people there .
they were told that buses were coming .
police drove by , windows rolled up , thumbs up signs .
national guard trucks rolled by , completely empty , soldiers with guns cocked and aimed at them .
nobody stopped to drop off water .
a helicopter dropped a load of water , but all the bottles exploded on impact due to the height of the helicopter .
the first day ( Wednesday ) 4 people died next to her .
the second day ( Thursday ) 6 people died next to her .
Denise told me the people around her all thought they had been sent there to die .
again , nobody stopped .
the only buses that came were full ; they dropped off more and more people , but nobody was being picked up and taken away .
they found out that those being dropped off had been rescued from rooftops and attics ; they got off the buses delirious from lack of water and food .
completely dehydrated .
the crowd tried to keep them all in one area ; Denise said the new arrivals had mostly lost their minds .
they had gone crazy .
inside the convention center , the place was one huge bathroom .
in order to shit , you had to stand in other people 's shit .
the floors were black and slick with shit .
most people stayed outside because the smell was so bad .
but outside was n't much better : between the heat , the humidity , the lack of water , the old and very young dying from dehydration ... and there was no place to lay down , not even room on the sidewalk .
they slept outside Wednesday night , under an overpass .
Denise said yes , there were young men with guns there .
but they organized the crowd .
they went to Canal Street and " looted , " and brought back food and water for the old people and the babies , because nobody had eaten in days .
when the police rolled down windows and yelled out " the buses are coming , " the young men with guns organized the crowd in order : old people in front , women and children next , men in the back .
just so that when the buses came , there would be priorities of who got out first .
Denise said the fights she saw between the young men with guns were fist fights .
she saw them put their guns down and fight rather than shoot up the crowd .
but she said that there were a handful of people shot in the convention center ; their bodies were left inside , along with other dead babies and old people .
Denise said the people thought there were being sent there to die .
lots of people being dropped off , nobody being picked up .
cops passing by , speeding off .
national guard rolling by with guns aimed at them .
and yes , a few men shot at the police , because at a certain point all the people thought the cops were coming to hurt them , to kill them all .
she saw a young man who had stolen a car speed past , cops in pursuit ; he crashed the car , got out and ran , and the cops shot him in the back .
in front of the whole crowd .
she saw many groups of people decide that they were going to walk across the bridge to the west bank , and those same groups would return , saying that they were met at the top of the bridge by armed police ordering them to turn around , that they were n't allowed to leave .
I have class issues .
I 've never been comfortable with wealthy people and the notion of wealth .
I recently told someone that my feelings are a result of my hatred of the relentless pursuit of material wealth - - a soulless endeavor which I believe does not cause happiness , despite society 's claims .
I explained that the lifestyles of the rich and famous first create envy .
This is followed by the empty pursuit of wealth .
The conclusion of this sad quest is frustration and unhappiness .
But I forgot why , about a decade ago , I came to hate vast wealth in the first place .
I 'll get to the explanation some other day .
At any rate , though , I was reminded two weeks ago .
Like so many other people , I was disgusted to see that the poorest and neediest of New Orleans ' residents were left behind to fend for themselves when Hurricane Katrina came ashore .
We live in a nation in which some people can afford a $ 1390 handbag from Prada ; we live in a nation in which certain wealthy people feel no qualms spending thousands on shoes ; we live in a nation in which many are expected to spend exorbitant amounts of money on weddings .
Yet we live in a nation that treats its most vulnerable citizens like sewer rats .
This is morally reprehensible .
It simply can not be defended .
Here 's one tale of horror :
The amount of money Americans have donated in the wake of the hurricane to organizations such as the Red Cross is staggering .
Their commendable generosity will undoubtedly help the victims of Katrina .
However , these people have been victimized by society for years and nothing has been done .
Think about it : While New Orleans 's destitute were suffering , a wealthy American was probably shopping for a $ 55,000 Hummer .
This person was able to frivolously waste money on a vehicle that will waste a colossal amount of fuel while poor New Orleans residents without cars were stuck in a soon - to - be war zone .
How can this be ?
How can we treat them so callously ?
Consider the following graph :
Source : Arthur B. Kennickell , " A Rolling Tide : Changes in the Distribution of Wealth in the U.S. , 1989 - 2001 "
This massive concentration of wealth at the very top fuels much of our economy .
Because they are the captains of the economic ship , the wealthy are treated best .
If we do n't treat them exceptionally , they argue that they will become disenchanted and our economy will suffer .
They are given absurd tax cuts and their corporations benefit from legislation that harms the general welfare of this nation .
Therefore , the barons of industry are living the high life while many are struggling .
So what if the bottom 50 % struggles ?
They own less than three percent of the wealth , making their economic impact miniscule .
Of course , the captains still need passengers on their ship .
These are the people who drive the consumer economy .
Consider the following graphs :
Source : Washington Post
The people in the top fifth and , to a lesser extent , the fourth fifth , have always occupied more seats on the boat .
As the wages of the top fifth continue to dramatically rise , these people become increasingly valuable in the eyes of the marketplace .
Meanwhile , as the bottom fifth 's wages become proportionally smaller , they are worth less in the eyes of the marketplace .
Because America worships at the altar of the marketplace , the poor , therefore , are considered worthless people .
Allow me to use a different metaphor .
The economic train will continue to run as long as enough people have an increasing supply of disposable income to fuel the train .
The conductor does n't care if the bottom fifth has no gas .
He 's getting plenty of fuel from the top two - fifths .
This information is no big secret .
It 's just that no one is paying attention .
In fact , shortly before Katrina hit , while many Americans were still following the story of some inconsequential teenager in Aruba , the Wall Street Journal reported the following :
Although the U.S. economy grew robustly last year , the income of the median household slipped a bit , wages of full - time workers fell , the number of Americans living below the poverty line rose and more Americans went without health insurance , the Census Bureau said .
I know you must be thinking that I 'm some kind of communist , advocating for an equal distribution of wealth .
I 'm not .
I 'm a fan of capitalism , and I believe a capitalistic system will inevitably cause wealth inequality .
However , a civilized society must keep that under control .
I do n't know what the answer is , although I can tell you that abolishing the estate tax is not the answer .
Today on NPR , a fellow from the Brookings Institution offered a suggestion .
It may be a start .
I wanted to include this quote from Franklin Roosevelt , but forgot :
The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much .
It is whether we provide enough for those who have little .

爪が厚くなっており、濁っている、爪の表面がぼろぼろになって綺麗に生えてこなくて筋のようなものがたくさんできる、爪の周りに炎症ができてしまう靴などを履くときに痛みを感じるなど爪の変形がある場合、爪水虫を疑う必要があります。
この爪の変形を引き起こす水虫は、足水虫と同様の白癬菌に感染した状態です。
白癬菌が爪の中まで感染することによってこのような症状が引き起こされます。
多くの場合親指が感染しているため、親指に異変があれば白癬菌に感染している可能性があると考えた方がよいとされています。
爪水虫の厄介さは体のさまざまな部分に広がり、他の人に感染しやすいことです。
周囲の人への影響を与えてしまうことがあるため。
できるだけ早く治療することをおすすめします。
この爪の変形を引き起こす原因はさまざまありますが、ネイルのオシャレをしている人はとくに注意が必要です。
爪を例に整えることのできるジェルネイルや付け爪ですが、時間とともに硬化したジェエルやスカルプチェアが爪から浮いた状態になってしまいます。
そのまま浮いた状態にしていると隙間に緑膿菌や白癬菌などが入り込んで増殖してグリーンネイルや爪水虫となってしまうのです。
また、水虫になっているとネイルサロンでのケアを受けることができないとされています。
治療したいという場合には、病院での治療を行なう必要があります。
市販の薬での治療は難しいとされており、きちんと治すためには医師に処方された薬を服用する必要があります。
爪へのオシャレを楽しむ人はたくさんいますが、爪の健康に関しては無関心な人が多いのが現状です。
オシャレを楽しむためには健康な爪であることが前提のため、水虫の予防や治療をきちんと行なうことが大切です。
Mr Injaz wanted asylum in the UK
Nadim Injaz , 28 , from Ramallah in the West Bank , had threatened to kill himself on live television if he did not get asylum .
Mr Injaz is a Palestinian and is reported to have been an informant .
He was chased down an alleyway by officers , held and taken off the compound , the BBC's Paul Adams said .
Our correspondent said there were no shots fired and no injuries .
He said it was believed food given to Mr Injaz may have contained a sedative to slow down his reactions .
Someone should come and help me .
No one wants to help me
Nadim Injaz
Mr Injaz was reported to have been armed with a pistol , but this was later found to have been a toy gun , police told Israel 's Channel 10 TV , news agency Reuters reported .
The man , who entered the compound several hours earlier , had reportedly told another Israeli broadcaster , Channel 2 : " Someone should come and help me .
No one wants to help me . "
Mr Injaz is said to have feared he may have been killed by Palestinian militants , and that Israeli authorities refused to help him .
It is thought he scaled a fence to enter the compound .
The UK Foreign Office said the Israeli police took action after British authorities asked for help dealing with the situation .
Embassy spokeswoman Karen Kaufman said : " As far as the embassy is concerned , the event is over . "
BBC Jerusalem correspondent Nick
Thorpe says the British embassy is a secure modern building near the seafront in Tel Aviv , with a high metal fence and security barriers .
Visitors to the embassy are normally screened by guards at the gate .
Why Do n’t Americans Suck at the Tour de France ?
The U.S. national soccer team recently embarassed itself in the World Cup .
During the Olympics , U.S. athletes regularly get beat in certain sports that , like soccer , are taken much more seriously in other countries than in ours .
So why have Americans done so well in the Tour de France ?
American cyclists have won 10 of the past 20 TdF’s — well , two American cyclists : Greg Lemond ( 1986 , 1989 , 1990 ) and Lance Armstrong ( 1999 -2005 ) .
And Floyd Landis , after a mind - blowing ride yesterday , may win this year ’s .
( Landis , btw , is a fascinating guy , who ’s been riding with a degenerative hip ; see Daniel Coyle ’s recent profile and , even better , read Coyle ’s book Lance Armstrong ’s War . )
And other American riders have been finishing very well in the TdF in recent years .
Why ?
A cynic may well answer that we have better doctors .
There has been so much doping among elite cyclists that it ’s hard for some people to imagine that American cyclists are n’t also doping .
That is a really interesting can of worms that I wo n’t open here .
But how is it that cycling , which is about as popular in the U.S. as the biathlon or the luge , is different ?
Why are American cyclists so much better than American soccer players , e.g.?
There ’s an article in today ’s Wall Street Journal ( no link , sorry ) that tries to answer this question .
American cyclists claim that they train harder , more experimentally , and more scientifically than their European peers .
It ’s true that Armstrong was a techno - junkie , in love with innovative equipment , procedure , and strategy .
But it ’s also true that Armstrong pretty much spent his whole year working toward the TdF , riding the course repeatedly in training , whereas the European cyclists take other races just as seriously ( if not more so : for an Italian cyclist , the Giro D’Italia is pretty big stuff ) .
And it ’s probably a lot easier to produce a few stellar athletes like LeMond and Armstong ( who , by the way , hate each other ) than an entire cohesive team like you need to win some World Cup soccer games .
Still , it is amazing to me that Americans do so well in a sport whose profile here is very , very minor .
At least the TdF manages to help sell some bicycles in the U.S .

American football protective equipment ( " football gear " ) consists of equipment worn by football players for the protection of the body during the course of football games .
Basic equipments worn by almost all football players include a helmet , shoulder pads , gloves , shoes , and thigh and knee pads .
Neck rolls , elbow pads , mouth guards , hip pads , tailbone pads , rib pads , and other equipments may be worn in addition to the aforementioned basics .
Football protective equipment is made of synthetic materials : foam rubbers , elastics , and durable , shock - resistant , molded plastic .
Football protective equipment has remained consistent in use for decades with some slight modifications made over the years in design and materials .
The assignment and maintenance of football gear belongs to the team equipment manager .
The professional football helmet consists of several distinct parts : the shell , jaw pads and air bladders , face mask , chin strap , and mouth guard .
The shell is constructed of hard plastic with thick padding on the inside , a face mask made of one or more metal bars , and a chinstrap used to secure the helmet .
Helmets are a requirement at all levels of organized football , except for non-tackle variations such as flag football .
Although they are protective , players can and do still suffer head injuries such as concussion .
Each position has a different type of face mask to balance protection and visibility .
There are at least 15 different facemask styles .
New design for the helmet includes an integrated faceguard featuring shock absorbing " Energy Wedges " that reduce the force of impacts to the faceguard .
The NFL allowed dummy communication in regular - season games in 1994 .
Rather than coaches calling a time - out in order to give a play to a quarterback , many of today 's teams are opting for radios inside their quarterback 's helmet .
The helmets are set up with a small speaker in each ear hole .
Quarterback coaches or offensive coordinators on the sidelines talk to the quarterback with a radio , giving him specific plays and options .
Players from the " old school " might argue that this creates an unfair advantage , but proponents say that the radio helmets make for clear coach - to people communication , even in large , noisy games like the Super Bowl .
NFL rules state that all helmets with a headset in them must have a visible green dot on the back .
Since only the quarterback can have a wired helmet , it stops other players using the quarterback 's helmet .
A few times in 2006 the holder on the field goal attempt was told to pull up and throw or run at the last second because of a change the coaches saw on the field .
This gave teams an " unfair advantage " in the eyes of the NFL .
The new rules let each team know who is wearing a headset and who is hearing the plays being called .
According to a press interview held with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers , the quality of the sound is good , but crowd noise factors in .
“ It ’s about like what you ’d hear over a loudspeaker , ” said Bucs QB Shaun King .
“ It can be hard to hear when there ’s a lot of noise on the outside , but it ’s pretty cool . "
A more recent addition to the football helmet is a visor or eyeshield , traditionally used to protect players from eye injuries or glare .
Former Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon was the first to wear a visor / shield .
The visors started out as clear or smoked , but now come in colors ranging from blue , gold , black , rainbow , silver , or amber .
The visor / shield is used at the player 's discretion .
The helmet fitting process starts by measuring the player 's head with calipers .
Based on measurements taken , a helmet shell of the appropriate size and style is chosen
Then , padding is added to ensure that the helmet fits the player 's head .
Padding consists of both foam rubber pads and inflatable ( air ) pads .
Both the top and side padding include inflatable bladders that customize the fit .
Once the helmet is in place on the player 's head , the inflator bulb is applied to two points on the outside of the helmet .
The jaw pads are fitted to ensure that the lower part of the helmet is snug against the player 's face .
The helmets that most NFL teams use are remarkably light , and once the pads are in place , there is no movement or shifting on the player 's head .
Football helmets are painted in team colors and bear team insignia decals .
There are several styles of face masks and chin straps available .
The selection is left to the player , with quarterbacks generally selecting more open masks with maximum visibility .
Off the gridiron , football helmets figure in the masculine decorative schemes seen in home dens , bars , and rec rooms , for example .
Antique and vintage leather football helmets are collectibles and most are really expensive .

TurboGears got its first public display at the first Michigan Python Users Group meeting in September 2005 .
Last night , at the end of the latest michipug meeting , I flipped the switch to release TurboGears 1.0b1 .
Here is the announcement email that went out :
I am pleased to announce TurboGears 1.0b1 , which now supersedes the 0.8.9 release as the preferred TurboGears release .
Many people have been using the TurboGears 0.9 x releases for several months now and have been very happy with the results .
The 1.0 APIs are stable and weâ€™re focused on bugs and docs for the final 1.0 release .
This is a bugfix release over 0.9a9 .
What is TurboGears ?
TurboGears is a popular rapid web development megaframework , built from a number of great Python projects and with a bunch of high - level features built within the TurboGears project .
TurboGears is a front - to - back framework helping you on the front end ( the MochiKit JavaScript library ) , templates for the view ( Kid ) , the controller in the middle ( based on CherryPy ) and an object - relational mapper for your database ( SQLObject ) .
To that mix of projects , TG adds :
Widgets : Python objects that bundle JavaScript , CSS , HTML and server - side validation to make form creation and powerful JavaScript features easy .
Internationalization : Tools and APIs to help you localize the strings in your application .
Identity : Authentication and authorization made easy
Toolbox : a web - based GUI to help you work on your project ( write your own as well ! )
Includes CatWalk to help you work with your database data and Model Designer to help you design your database graphically .
tg - admin : command line tool that gives you a quick start to your project , helps you set up your database and more !
Easy Ajax : flexible template support allows you to choose a different template engine ( output HTML , JSON , plain text , etc. all from one method )
Built - in database transactions : keeps your database ( and you ! ) sane .
Transactions are committed or rolled back based on the success or failure of your controller code .
flexibility as needed : though Kid and SQLObject are the standards , we already support many other template engines ( Cheetah , Markup , Django ) and the powerful SQLAlchemy object - relational mapper .
community : last but definitely not least â€ ” more than 2,000 users on the main mailing list , and others on non-English mailing lists
In short , there are lots of tools to help you get the job done quickly .
Whatâ€™s New Since 0.8
Nearly everything .
All of the projects that TG uses have had significant upgrades , and nearly all of the features that have been built by TurboGears contributors are new .

You 've heard , I hope , about NASA climate scientist James Hansen , who the Bush administration tried to silence when he called for reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases .
Cosmology , as it turns out , is not exempt from the radical anti-science agenda .
The New York Times , via Atrios :
In October , for example , George Deutsch , a presidential appointee in NASA headquarters , told a Web designer working for the agency to add the word " theory " after every mention of the Big Bang , according to an e-mail message from Mr. Deutsch that another NASA employee forwarded to The Times .
... The Big Bang memo came from Mr. Deutsch , a 24 - year - old presidential appointee in the press office at NASA headquarters whose resume says he was an intern in the " war room " of the 2004 Bush - Cheney re-election campaign .
A 2003 journalism graduate of Texas A&M , he was also the public - affairs officer who sought more control over Dr. Hansen 's public statements .
In October 2005 , Mr. Deutsch sent an e-mail message to Flint Wild , a NASA contractor working on a set of Web presentations about Einstein for middle - school students .
The message said the word " theory " needed to be added after every mention of the Big Bang .
The Big Bang is " not proven fact ; it is opinion , " Mr. Deutsch wrote , adding , " It is not NASA 's place , nor should it be to make a declaration such as this about the existence of the universe that discounts intelligent design by a creator . "
It continued : " This is more than a science issue , it is a religious issue .
And I would hate to think that young people would only be getting one - half of this debate from NASA .
That would mean we had failed to properly educate the very people who rely on us for factual information the most . "

Spinner dolphins work hard to earn their name .
In one astounding leap into the air , they can spin around up to seven times .
With underwater movie footage and a mathematical model , scientists can now explain just how dolphins manage the acrobatic feat .
Before takeoff , the animal begins its spin underwater .
Using its flippers like wings , it starts a gentle barrel roll .
The movement is slow because the dolphin's fin and flippers drag against the water , which adds a lot of resistance .
Try this at home
Mystery Monday Each Monday , LiveScience will step back from the news and explore an amazing aspect of the natural world .
This is the inaugural installment of Mystery Monday .
As always , we 'd love to hear what you think .
Contact LiveScience .
It 's like having your hand in the bathtub , says West Chester University physicist Anthony Nicastro .
" You can feel resistance , due to all that water you 're pushing around , " Nicastro explained .
" The dolphin has flippers , a dorsal fin , and other surfaces dragging water .
Underwater , they generate 1 or 2 spins per second . "
Once a dolphin breaks the surface , everything changes .
As it enters the air , the dolphin sheds all of the resistant forces that slowed it down in the water .
And that 's when things really get dizzy .
Airborne , the spinner dolphin can make up to seven revolutions in as little as a second .
Previous studies suggested that a dolphin generated the spins by the way it twisted its body , once it broke the surface .
" You 're not going to spin much at all from a flat jump .
It just does n't make sense in a real world model , " says biologist Frank Fish , also from West Chester University .
By using calculus , the mathematical model that Nicastro came up with correctly describes how the spin works .
The results were published in the January 2006 issue of the Journal of Experimental Biology .
But why ?
Nobody knows for sure why spinner dolphins spin .
There could be all kinds of reasons : to display dominance , to communicate their location , to hunt , or just for fun .
It could also be an easy way to shake off fish taking a free ride .
Remoras , fish with dorsal fins that acts like suction cups , stick to sharks and whales .
The suckers add extra drag to a dolphin's streamlining , says Fish the biologist .
Curious to learn what it felt like to have a remora suck him , Fish stuck one on his back .
" They went into my skin — it hurt ! " he says .
Dolphins have sensitive skin with lots of nerve endings , so remoras may be an irritant to the animals , Fish figures .
When a dolphin jumps into the air and spins , remoras flail out .
And when the dolphin lands on the surface , with a huge splash , it will knock off the pesky pisces .
" If the dolphin were n't spinning , the remoras would stay on .
The spinning action is what knocks off the remora , " Nicastro said .
Radical Danish imams have deliberately incited hatred against Denmark , the country that had hospitably welcomed them in .
To this end , while on a visit to Arab countries last month , they added three false , extremely offensive Muhammad “ cartoons ” to the twelve relatively mild ones published by Jyllands - Posten last September [ see the latter here , halfway down the page ] .
One of the three additional cartoons [ we linked to them in this article ] , which the imams distributed on a faxed image of appalling quality , was said to be a depiction of Muhammad with a pigsnout .
When the Danish press discovered the three false so - called Danish cartoons , the imams refused to say where they had got them .
They claimed , however , that the false cartoons were genuinely Danish and had been added to “ give an insight in how hateful the atmosphere in Denmark is towards Muslims . ”
The Brussels Journal has always doubted whether the cartoons added by the imams were genuine .
Whenever we mentioned them we explicitly wondered whether they were not “ of the imam ’s own making . ”
Certain Western mainstream media , however , such as the Australian network SBS and the British BBC authoritatively declared that the pigsnout was one of Jyllands - Posten ’s cartoons .
Yesterday an American blogger discovered where the “ pigsnout Muhammad ” comes from .
It has no relation to Muhammad whatsoever , it is not even a cartoon , but a fax image of a photo of a French clown performing at a pig festival .
Denmark is being punished at the instigation of radical imams because twelve cartoonists have depicted Muhammad .
However , these imams created their own three Muhammad images .
They have even presented a French clown as being Muhammad .
Because the twelve JP cartoonists are not Muslims , the Muslim blasphemy laws do not apply to them .
But these laws do apply to the imams .
Consequently , these imams deserve death .
They – and no - one else – depicted the prophet as a pig – the highest imaginable insult in Islam .
In his letter of “ apology ” Jyllands - Posten editor Carsten Juste wrote :
“ In our opinion the 12 cartoons were moderate and not intended to be insulting .
They did not go against Danish laws , but have evidently offended many Muslims , for which we apologize .
Meanwhile a couple of offending cartoons have circulated in the Muslim world which were never published in Jyllands - Posten and which we would never have published if they had been offered to us .
We would have dismissed them on the grounds that they breached our ethical limits . ”
Indeed , the three cartoons breaching the paper ’s ethical limits have been made by fanatical Muslim clerics themselves in order to set the world ablaze and provoke a religious war with the West .
Even under Western law the Danish radical imams belong in jail .
Their hate crime must be punished .
The imams are the hate preachers who are responsible for the destruction and the fatalities that resulted from their lies and their blasphemy .
One of these lying imams is Ahmed Abdel Rahman Abu Laban .
He works as a translator and distributor of an al - Qaeda related publication .
Western papers and blogs that published the twelve cartoons were right to do so .
If they had not published , no - one would have been able to ascertain that the pigsnout was not among them .
If they had not published , the cheating , blasphemous imams would have got away with their lies .
The public is served by information , never harmed by it .
Let this be a lesson to the cowards of The Guardian , SBS , the BBC and the British and American mainstream media , who “ out of respect ” for Islam would have allowed blasphemous imams to get away with their gross insult of the prophet , with slander and libel , and with the violent acts which they instigated .
Meanwhile , Muslim moderates have established a website to apologize to Denmark and Norway ( though in our opinion the Norwegian government does not deserve it ) .
They write :
In the middle of all the mayhem surrounding the Danish cartoons controversy , a group of Arab and Muslim youth have set up this website to express their honest opinion , as a small attempt to show the world that the images shown of Arab and Muslim anger around the world are not representative of the opinions of all Arabs .
We whole - heartedly apologize to the people of Denmark , Norway and all the European Union over the actions of a few , and we completely condemn all forms of vandalism and incitement to violence that the Arab and Muslim world have witnessed .
We hope that this sad episode will not tarnish the great friendship that our peoples have fostered over decades .
Meanwhile , too , an American blogger is currently updating his “ Country Report Card ” on how the various governments and nations react to the cartoon scandal .
He has given an A to the governments of Denmark , France and Germany ; and an F to those of Norway , Britain and Poland .
The U.S. government got a D. Governments that got grades below C should be ashamed of themselves .

Keith checks the pH of the waste oil .
NOTE
: Beginners should avoid poor - quality oil like this for their first test - batches with used oil .
Find a source of oil that titrates at about 2.5 ml of 0.1 % NaOH solution or less , not more than 3.5 ml .
Leave overcooked oils with higher titration levels for later when you have more experience .
Try to get a selection of used oils from different restaurants -- if you 're friendly and polite and tell them what it 's for they usually wo n't mind giving you a couple of litres .
Find out what kind of oil they use .
( This might not be the best time to suggest collecting large amounts of oil for full - scale production , leave that for later , unless they suggest it first . )
Start by titrating the samples .
Use low - titration oil for your first used oil test batches , move on to higher titration levels and different kinds of oil as you gain experience .
If you have difficulties at first , it could be due to the kind of oil you 're using -- see above , Which oil is best ?
If not , then see What should you do if your fuel does n't pass the wash - test ? and How to use the quality tests , as with new oil .
Test batches with used oil
Make small , one - litre test batches .
Use the same procedure as with new oil , see above .
Measure out the lye and mix it with the methanol to make sodium methoxide or potassium methoxide -- it will get slightly hotter and take a little longer to mix as there 's more lye this time .
Make sure the lye is completely dissolved in the methanol .
( See above , Mixing the methoxide . )
Carefully add the methoxide to the warmed oil while stirring , and mix for an hour .
Settle for 12 - 24 hours , then syphon off or decant the biodiesel .
Check the quality of your biodiesel with these quality tests .
The first five times we did this , using 10 litres of waste oil each time , we got biodiesel ( a bit darker than the new oil product ) and glycerine three times , and twice we got jelly .
The answer is to be more careful with the titration : do it two or three times at first , until you 've had more practice and perfected your technique .
With poor - quality oils that have high titration levels do bracket tests as well .
Do everything you can to improve the accuracy of your measurements so you get consistent results .
Read on , and you 'll learn how to make high - quality biodiesel every time , without fail .
( It 's a LONG time since we made jelly ! )
The production rate with our first batches was less than with new oil , ending with 8 - 9 litres of biodiesel instead of 10 .
With care and experience the production rate improves .
Moving on to bigger things
When you 're confident that you can get good results every time , even using oil from different sources , then it 's time to scale up the process to provide your fuel needs .
Now that you have a feel for the process and know what to expect , you 'll have a much better idea of what sort of processor you want than if you 'd started off building the processor ( as many do ) rather than learning the process first .
" Understanding of the process is vital to operate the plant . " -- Prof. P.V. Pannir Selvam , Technology Center , Department of Chemical Engineering , Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte ( UFRN ) , Brazil , Biofuel mailing list , 15 Apr 2007
See Biodiesel processors .
However , one - litre test batches are not just something for beginners .
It 's a basic technique you 'll always use .
Many experienced biodiesel makers do test batches with each batch of oil .
Many not only titrate the oil every time to calculate the right amount of lye to use , they also do " bracket " tests in sequence , followed by wash tests .
You learn a lot that way , your fuel gets better , life gets easier .
In fact life is already easier -- people who start off making 40 - gallon batches often never learn the accuracy and discipline that comes from making one - litre test batches first .
Their fuel quality suffers for it , and when they encounter that inevitable " problem batch " , they suffer for it too .
But if you 've followed the instructions here carefully , you 'll be familiar with all the variables , you 'll have good methodology , and you 'll be in a much better position to trouble - shoot a problem batch successfully .
Keep a Biodiesel Journal -- make notes , keep records .
Get some small glass jars and keep samples of all your batches , clearly labelled and cross-referenced to the notes in your journal .
You wo n't regret it .
When scaling up from small test - batches to a full - sized processor , be aware that the process will probably need some adjusting .
All the various processing methods use averages and approximations because processors and conditions vary so widely .
Blenders especially agitate much faster than any full - scale processor , a real processor will probably take longer to achieve the same result .
Use the fuel quality tests to fine - tune the process to your particular processor .
See Scaling up .
Removing the water
Water in the oil interferes with the lye catalyst , especially if you use too much lye , and you can end up with a batch of jelly .
Test first for water content -- heat half a litre or so of the oil in a saucepan on the stove and monitor the temperature with a thermometer .
If there 's water in it it will start to " snap , crackle and pop " by 50 deg C ( 120 deg F ) or so .
If it 's still not crackling by 60 - 65 deg C ( 140 - 149 deg F ) there should be no need to dewater it .
See Mike Pelly 's recommendations : Removing the water .
Here 's another way , from Aleks Kac -- it uses less energy and does n't risk forming more Free Fatty Acids ( see below ) by overheating .
Heat the oil to 60 deg C ( 140 deg F ) , maintain the temperature for 15 minutes and then pour the oil into a settling tank .
Let it settle for at least 24 hours ( or for a week or two ) .
Pump the oil out from the top , leave the bottom 90 % for removal later and re-settling .
Here 's what Biofuel mailing list member Dale Scroggins says about water removal :
Water in vegetable oil can exist as free water , which will eventually settle to the bottom of a vessel ; as suspended droplets , which may settle if the oil is heated , or the droplets are coalesced ; and as water in solution with other impurities in the oil .
Free water is the easiest to remove .
The droplets are removed most efficiently by coalescing and draining .
Suspended droplets that cannot be coalesced and water in solution are more problematic .
Boiling off the water is more difficult than it appears on the surface .
Colligative properties of solutions ( and some mixtures ) can make removal of the last traces of water almost impossible .
Water mixed with oil will not boil at the same temperature and pressure as pure water .
As water is removed , more heat or lower pressure will be required to remove more water .
If the oil contains salts or semi- soluble fatty acids , distillation is even more difficult .
As the percentage of water in the solution decreases ( its molar fraction ) its vapor pressure will continue to drop .
Lowering pressure in the system alone may be insufficient to sustain vaporization when the solution becomes concentrated ( the molar fraction of the solute greatly exceeds that of the solvent ) .
Results will vary depending upon the nature of the water - soluble impurities in the oil .
Few solutions are ideal , in terms of Raoult 's law , and in used vegetable oil , there is no way to know what solutes are in the oil .
The important thing is how well - used , or overused , the oil is .
Titration will tell you that .
The higher the titration result and the more acidic the oil , the more water it 's likely to contain , and the more difficult it will probably be to remove the water .
Biofuel list member Joe Street adds :
Although Dale 's points about unknown solutes in waste vegetable oil and their ability to lock up water are true I have found that practically speaking oil ( even terrible oil ) can be reliably dried to the point of being reacted without problems by the process of heat and vacuum .
Heating the oil to reaction temperature ( I use 58 deg C , 136 deg F ) and pulling a vacuum to 27 inches of mercury immediately before the reaction has allowed me to remove water beyond what falls out by heating alone .
I estimate that oil at 55 - 60 deg C can contain as much as 10,000 PPM ( that 's 1 % ) water .
I have experimented with some extremely saturated oils ( titrations up to 11 ml with 0.1 % KOH ) which require ridiculous amounts of catalyst when attempting base - only conversions .
Although I cannot get complete conversions in these cases , drying the oil by heating and vacuum has allowed me to do this and still avoid problems with soap formation .
( I am also very careful with my caustic and methanol . )
Using a known temperature and a vacuum gauge is a very repeatable way of drying oil .
( See : Joe Street 's processor )
Short of vacuum , start with heating the oil to 60 deg C and settling it , as Aleks Kac recommends , and if that does n't give satisfactory results , try boiling the water off , as Mike Pelly recommends .
Then try a small 1 - litre test batch first .
If you still have difficulties , try to find a source of better - quality oil .
Or try using a glycerine pre-wash to lower the Free Fatty Acid level and dry the oil ( see below , Glycerine pre-wash ) .
Or try this : Deacidifying WVO .
Filtering WVO
Many people filter their WVO before making biodiesel , but filtering takes time and energy , and there 's really no need to filter it .
Settling the oil works just as well or better , and if it contains any water the water will settle out too .
If it 's poor quality oil with a high titration level , heat it first , as in de-watering ( above ) , and then let it settle .
If you do n't have time to wait for the oil to settle , usually 1 - 2 weeks , it could be worth increasing the WVO supply and reserves to make the time .
If in collection you keep ahead of your processing rate , oil has a chance to settle .
I have found that oil that has been sitting for several weeks is very dry if carefully decanted .
Settling also results usually in oil which is spectacularly clear when observed in a glass container ( you can read fine print through it ) which means it is quite clean , perhaps cleaner than filtering may give you .
-- Joe Street , Biofuel mailing list , July 2006
I recently helped someone get off the ground making biodiesel .
He 's a tinkerer , and came up with an elaborate filtering / dewatering system .
I repeatedly suggested that he trust gravity .
He was away for about 10 days and when he came back he called to tell me that he could n't distinguish the oil from the top half of an unfiltered cubie from his filtered oil .
Getting rid of his filtering setup has made room for a settling tank .
-- Tom Kelly , Biofuel mailing list , April 2006
This is how Tom does it :
I allow the WVO to settle in cubies for a week .
( A cubie is the 4.5 gal ( 17.7L ) plastic container that veg oil is delivered to restaurants in . )
I then pour the top 80 % of each cubie into a 55 gal drum and consolidate the bottom 20 % of 5 cubies into 1 .
Most of this will be ready for the barrel the next week .
I have 4 WVO barrels .
One is settled , two are settling , and one is being filled .
I pump WVO out of the settled barrel from the top 3 / 4 .
This oil is very clear and requires very little drying .
We do it much the same way , settling the WVO first in the 18 - litre metal cans it 's supplied in here , then pouring it from the top .
What 's left at the bottom is re-settled .
We use a 55 - gal ( 200 - litre ) steel drum for storage , but we do n't pump the WVO out from the top .
The drum has a bottom drain fitted with a 6 " - high 3/4 " standpipe ( 15 cm - high x 1.9 cm ) , which leaves any sediment on the bottom of the drum undisturbed .
Every now and then we drain the drum to the top of the standpipe , then remove the standpipe and drain the drum completely , sediment and all .
The " bottoms " are resettled the same way , first in 18 - litre metal cans .
The final sediment can be used as fire - starter , or added to the compost pile .
Simple gravity settling works well with oils titrating up to 3.5 ml NaOH solution and more .
The higher the titration level , the more water , impurities and suspensions the oil is likely to contain and the longer it will take to settle .
For higher titration levels , heat the oil to 60 deg C ( 140 deg F ) , maintain the temperature for 15 minutes , then allow to cool , and let it settle .
Filtering biodiesel
There 's no need to filter your biodiesel before using it either .
If you make the biodiesel properly , everything that a filter might remove will be in the by - product layer , not the biodiesel .
The biodiesel should be ready for instant consumption if it 's clear and bright and without sediments .
-- Jan Warnqvist , Biofuel mailing list , Aug 2005
If the WVO has been filtered or settled to clear , any solid particles that get as far as the processor are small and wo n't affect the processing .
During processing and settling , all unfiltered solids drop out into the glycerine by - product layer .
Settle it properly , separate the by - product carefully , wash , dry , and use .
No need to filter it .
Badly processed biodiesel with poor conversion and too much soap might contain sediments in suspension , but if it 's properly made it will be without sediments .
Keep your processing fine - tuned by making test batches and using the quality tests .
People often want to " speed up " the process in the hopes of making it more efficient , and that often means taking short - cuts with settling times .
Do n't do it -- life is easier with longer settling times , for the WVO , for the by - product to separate after processing , and for the wash - water to separate , especially after the final wash .
Actually what people speeding up the process usually want is n't more efficiency , it 's more production .
Probably they need a bigger processor , or two processors in parallel , rather than trying to make gravity hurry .
Extra washing and settling tanks also help .
Centrifuges
We do n't have much time for centrifuges either , for similar reasons .
Again , people want to " speed up " the process by using a centrifuge instead of settling ( or instead of washing , in some cases ) .
We 've had a number of reports that centrifuges give poor results compared with normal settling , and especially compared with washing -- washing centrifuged fuel has yielded very soapy wash - water , so obviously the centrifuging did n't work very well .
We have laboratory test results of " finished " biodiesel made here in Japan in a $ 70,000 commercial processor .
The finished fuel was washed and dried , and then it was centrifuged , and then samples were sent to the lab for testing .
But the centrifuged fuel did n't come close to the standards requirements .
Our biodiesel surpasses the standards requirements though , made in a $ 100 homebuilt processor , with no need for a centrifuge .
You do n't need a centrifuge .
As with filtering , if you want more production get a bigger processor , or run two processors in parallel , add more settling and washing tanks .
Glycerine pre-wash
From Biofuel mailing list member Chris Tan : " Good use for your glycerine cocktail " , 6 Oct 2007 :
Here 's a good use for your glycerine cocktail before finally giving it away .
My father came up with the idea that you can use the glycerine cocktail to dry your waste vegetable oil .
And it works .
Glycerine is hygroscopic enough to pull moisture out as it settles down so you do n't have to heat or boil the oil to dry it .
And as a bonus , most of the catalyst ends up in the glycerine cocktail so it neutralizes the Free Fatty Acids ( FFAs ) in the waste oil .
What we do is use at least 10/90 weight ratio : 10kg of glycerine for 90kg of waste oil .
It is possible to bring the FFA level to zero if you use large amounts of glycerine ( if you happen to have accumulated large amounts ) .
We use an ordinary 1 / 2 hp clear water pump with two inlet pipes to suck in glycerine and wvo .
I adjust the inlet openings to regulate the mixing .
We let it settle in a dedicated separate tank for about the same time as you would settle glycerine from biodiesel , though longer is better because of the viscosity of wvo .
We pump both glycerine cocktail and oil at the same time into a separate container .
The glycerine will flow at a lower rate and the the inlet opening should be adjusted so that it finishes at the same time as the oil .
You can also mix it in the processor ( just make sure to drain the water - rich glycerine and soap residue afterwards ) .
Cycle the glycerine cocktail and oil mixture twice .
The time it takes will depend on the gallons per minute rate of your pump , which is not the same for viscous oil , so measure and compute the time required for one or two cycles .
If the weather is cold , warming the oil first helps for mixing as well as settling : pre-heat to about 30 deg C ( 86 deg F ) .

Washing
Biodiesel must be washed before use to remove soaps , excess methanol , residual lye , free glycerine and other contaminants .
Some people ( fewer and fewer of them ) say washing is n't necessary , arguing that the small amounts of contaminants cause no engine damage .

The " energy " does you no good if your particular thermodynamic cycle can't take advantage of it .
What is the cetane rating of methanol ?
-- Ken Provost , Biofuel mailing list , " Re : washing ? "
Quite so .
The cetane rating of methanol is only 3 , very low .
Low cetane - number fuel in a diesel causes ignition delay and makes the engine knock .
The high - speed diesel engines in cars and trucks are designed to use fuels with cetane numbers of about 50 .
The US biodiesel standard specifies a cetane number higher than 47 , the EU standard specifies higher than 51 .
The methanol in unwashed biodiesel does n't " make a great fuel anyway " .
It 's also very corrosive .
The EU biodiesel standard specifies less than 0.2 % methanol content .
Quality biodiesel is well - washed biodiesel .
Filtering it is no use , and letting it settle for a few weeks wo n't help much either .
Anyway washing the fuel is easy .
See Washing
Using biodiesel
You do n't have to convert the engine to run it on biodiesel , but you might need to make some adjustments and you should check a few things .
Petroleum diesel leaves a lot of dirt in the tank and the fuel system .
Biodiesel is a good solvent -- it tends to free the dirt and clean it out .
Be sure to check the fuel filters regularly at first .
Start off with a new fuel filter .
If a car has been left standing for a long time with petroleum diesel fuel in the tank the inside of the tank may have rusted ( water content is a common problem with petro - diesel fuel ) .
Biodiesel will free up the rust , and it could clog the particle filter inside the tank .
At worst the car simply stops , starved of fuel .
It 's not a very common problem , but it happens .
See : Biodiesel and your vehicle -- Compatability : Filters .
A common warning is that biodiesel , especially 100 % biodiesel , will rot any natural or butyl rubber parts in the fuel system , whether fuel lines or injector pump seals , and that they must first be replaced with resistant parts made of Viton .
But rubber parts in diesel engine fuel systems have been rare or non-existent since the early 1980s -- it seldom happens , and when it does happen it's not catastrophic , you have plenty of warning and it 's easily fixed .
See : Biodiesel and your vehicle -- Compatability : Rubber .

Safety
Please read this whole section right to the end .
Wear proper protective gloves , apron , and eye protection and do not inhale any vapours .
Methanol can cause blindness and death .
Sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide can cause severe burns and death .
Mixed with methanol they form methoxide .
This is an extremely caustic chemical .
These are dangerous chemicals -- treat them with respect !
Gloves should be chemical - proof with cuffs that can be pulled up over long sleeves -- no shorts or sandals .
Always have running water handy .
Have a bottle of vinegar handy to neutralise any lye or methoxide you may get on your skin -- rinse it off with vinegar , then rinse thoroughly with water .
( If you do n't have any vinegar handy , just use lots of water . )
The workspace must be thoroughly ventilated .
No children or pets allowed .
Organic vapor cartridge respirators are more or less useless against methanol vapors .
Professional advice is not to use organic vapor cartridges for longer than a few hours maximum , or not to use them at all .
Only a supplied - air system will do ( SCBA -- Self - Contained Breathing Apparatus ) .
The best advice is not to expose yourself to the fumes in the first place .
The main danger is when the methanol is hot -- when it 's cold or at " room temperature " it fumes very little if at all and it 's easily avoided , just keep it at arm 's length whenever you open the container .
Do n't use " open " reactors -- biodiesel processors should be closed to the atmosphere , with no fumes escaping .
All methanol containers should be kept tightly closed anyway to prevent water absorption from the air .
We transfer methanol from its container to the methoxide mixing container by pumping it , with no exposure .
This is easily arranged , and an ordinary small aquarium air - pump will do .
The methoxide is mixed like this -- Methoxide the easy way , which also happens to be the safe way .
The mixture gets quite hot at first , but the container is kept closed and no fumes escape .
When mixed , the methoxide is again pumped into the ( closed ) biodiesel processor with the aquarium air - pump -- there 's no exposure to fumes , and it 's added slowly , which is optimal for the process and also for safety .
See Adding the methoxide .
Once again , making biodiesel is safe if you 're careful and sensible -- nothing about life is safe if you 're not careful and sensible !
" Sensible " also mean not over - reacting , as some people do : " I 'd like to make biodiesel but I 'm frightened of all those terrible poisons . "
In fact they 're common enough household chemicals .
Lye is sold in supermarkets and hardware stores as a drain - cleaner , there 's probably a can of it under the sink in most households .
Methanol is the main or only ingredient in barbecue fuel or fondue fuel , sold in supermarkets and chain stores as " stove fuel " and used at the dinner table .
It 's also the main ingredient in the fuel kids use in their model aero engines .
So get it in perspective : be careful with these chemicals -- be careful with ALL chemicals -- but there 's no need to be frightened of them .

People have complained about the price of recorded music for decades .
It 's always seemed a little fishy that there was no price competition between the labels , and that CDs have always remained more expensive than cassettes , even though the discs are now dirt cheap to make .
When music went digital , why did we see so few price points for individual tracks ?
Today , why are all the major labels simultaneously making noise about wanting Apple to offer variable pricing ?
The whole situation fueled paranoid claims about industry collusion and price - fixing that later turned out to be totally justified .
You may remember that the industry was busted for off - line price - fixing a few years back .
It was also outed ( again ) for a major payola scandal last year .
This year , the industry is under the microscope for its pricing practices related to digital music .
The feds have already launched an investigation and New York Attorney General Elliot Spitzer is making his own inquiries .
Like a shark smelling blood in the water , the latest round of investigations has attracted the lawyers .
Prominent California attorney William Lerach has now launched a class action suit against the labels on behalf of consumers who have allegedly been overcharged for music .
This in itself is not particularly surprising given the ongoing federal investigation into the same topic , but the lawsuit does contain some interesting tidbits .
For instance , the suit claims that the music labels fought tooth and nail against the arrival of online music stores , and that they did so by launching their own poorly - conceived ( on purpose ) online ventures .
The suit also alleges that the record labels sought to shut down online music pioneer Napster at the same time they were introducing their own joint ventures to sell online music .
MusicNet and pressplay " were not serious commercial ventures , but rather attempts to occupy the market with frustrating and ineffectual services in order to head off viable Online Music competitors from forming and gaining popularity after Napster 's demise , " according to the suit .
If this lawsuit gains any traction , it could be a major headache for the music industry , because similar suits could wind up being filed in countries all over the world .
Given that many of the price - fixing allegations center on Apple 's iTunes Music Store , the labels could find themselves in trouble in more than twenty countries .
After all , intense dislike of getting screwed is not just an American phenomenon .

Wages and weekly earnings of Arab and Muslim men living in the US fell by 10 per cent following 9/11 , a new study shows .
In addition , the adverse effects of the terror attacks on wages were greater in areas that reported high rates of hate crime related to religious , ethnic or country of origin bias , according to the upcoming study in the Journal of Human Resources .
" I was surprised , " Robert Kaestner , study co-author and University of Illinois at Chicago professor of economics , said of the findings .
" We see an immediate and significant connection between personal prejudice and economic harm . "
Evidence suggests the terrorists ' attacks reduced intrastate migration , making Arab and Muslim men more reluctant to seek better opportunities in new destinations due to the uncertainty of their reception .
The study measured changes in wages of first - and second - generation immigrants from countries with predominantly Arab or Muslim populations between September 1997 and September 2005 and compared them to changes in wages of first - and second - generation immigrants with similar skills from other countries .
Abstract : COSA is a reactive , signal - based software construction and execution environment .
A COSA program is inherently concurrent and ideally suited for fine - grained parallel processing .
The two main goals of Project COSA is to enable the creation of bug - free software applications and to improve software productivity by several orders of magnitude .
COSA is based on the premise that unreliability is not an essential characteristic of complex software systems .
The primary reason that computer programs are unreliable is the age - old practice of using the algorithm as the basis of software construction .
Switch to a synchronous , signal - based model and the problem will disappear ( see The Silver Bullet page for more information on this topic ) .
Join the Project COSA Discussion Forum .
The software industry is in trouble .
Several decades of process improvements and innovations in testing procedures have failed to tame the twin beasts of unreliability and low productivity .
The widely perceived severity of the problem is justified by a legitimate concern over human safety and the risk of economic loss , security breaches , liability lawsuits and other misfortunes .
As the world becomes more and more dependent on computers and as the complexity of software systems continues to rise , the crisis can only get worse .
It is particularly severe in vital segments of the economy such as the health and financial services , and the transportation , manufacturing , communication , power generation , and defense industries .
The expensive custom systems used by these sectors account for more than 85 percent of the software market .
Their failure rate , i.e. , the percentage of projects that are started but are never deployed , is reported to be over 50 percent , a staggering figure considering the high cost of software development .
The main reason for the crisis is the lack of a sound software construction methodology with which to manage the high complexity of modern applications .
There are those who blame engineering incompetence and lack of discipline for the problem .
They are not seeing the whole picture .
The truth is that software engineering is bad mainly because the development tools and operating systems are bad .
The tools are bad because there is something wrong with the way we construct and run our software , something that no amount of quality assurance measures can ever cure .
Software is unreliable because of the practice of using the algorithm as the basis of software construction .
This is not to say that there is anything wrong with the algorithm .
It just should not be the basis of software .
See the Silver Bullet page for more on this .
We must abandon the algorithmic model and embrace a new paradigm .
Objects in the real world behave synchronously and causally .
Why should software objects be any different ?
Algorithmic Model COSA Model Implicitly Sequential Explicitly Sequential Explicitly Parallel Implicitly Parallel Procedural Reactive ( signal - based ) Latency Immediacy Function calling Message passing Asynchronous processes Synchronous processes Monolithic Compositional Chaotic Systematic Textual Graphical Hard to predict Causally ordered / deterministic Hand- coded Automated
The list above shows characteristics of both models for comparison .
The solution will require a strong commitment to deterministic causal principles .
It can only be done by adopting a software model based on reactive concurrency .
However , the required discipline and the commitment to these principles should not be the responsibility of the application developer but that of the operating system and tool vendor .
Unless we can create tools and systems that automatically enforce the new model painlessly and transparently , the world will continue to pay a heavy price for unreliable software .
Note : Synchronous processing is not the same as synchronous messaging .
Synchronous processing means that all elementary operations in a system have equal durations and are synchronized to a master clock .
Deterministic timing is a must for reliability .
The COSA model supports asynchronous messaging and signaling .
It also supports fine - grain parallelism .
Currently there exist hundreds of programming languages , operating systems and development tools competing against one another , not counting custom proprietary technologies .
A veritable tower of Babel .
Worse , the complexity of many of the tools is often greater than that of the applications .
Becoming proficient in their use often requires years of training and experience .
This is a sign of the chronic immaturity of the software industry .
Software engineering will not come of age until a single software construction and execution model is universally adopted .
Even computer processors must eventually be redesigned to support the new software model .
This is part of the motivation behind Project COSA .
COSA stands for Complementary Objects for Software Applications .
It is a reactive , signal - based software construction and execution environment .
The word ' Cosa ' means ' thing ' in several languages .
It is a fitting label for a software model in which the computer is viewed , not as a machine for the execution of instruction sequences , but as a collection of synchronously interacting objects or things .
An object in COSA is a simple virtual software entity that resides in computer memory , waits for a signal to perform an elementary operation , and then emits an output signal .
Software creation consists of connecting elementary objects ( cells ) together using a graphical software composition environment .
Cells can be combined into high - level , plug - compatible components and / or applications .
There are no procedures , no subroutines and no compile / run cycles .
Best of all , there is no programming language to learn .
One of the ideas behind COSA is that software should not be radically different than hardware .
Software should be an extension of hardware .
It should emulate the functionality of hardware and add only what is lacking : flexibility , random data access and ease of modification .
COSA is guided by the following principles :
Complementarity First and foremost , every object or concept in COSA has a complement or opposite .
Examples of complementary pairs are : sensor / effector , cause / effect , departure / arrival , start / stop , input / output , male / female , source / destination , mouse - up / mouse - down , component / constituent , etc ...
Complementarity is the single most powerful organizing principle in existence .
Any system , regardless of complexity , can be effectively and efficiently managed by applying this principle at every level of abstraction .
This can be argued on the basis of natural evidence ranging from the elementary particles and antiparticles of physics to the complementary base pairs of DNA .
Change - Driven
All COSA objects are concurrent and synchronous .
That is to say , they are always active , in the sense that a neuron is always active and ready to fire upon receiving a signal .
A signal - driven system is a change - driven system .
This means that no action or operation can take place unless something has changed .
A change ( aka event ) can be anything from a key press to a change in a data variable .
The primary advantage of this approach is that causes and effects are clearly identified .
Temporal Consistency Strict temporal determinacy is crucial to long - term reliability .
The relative temporal order of every action must be guaranteed to always be consistent .
Nothing must be allowed to happen before or after its time .
COSA guarantees that a software component will have a deterministic temporal behavior during its entire life cycle regardless of the environment in which it is used .
This is a natural consequence of the synchronous nature of COSA objects .
Passive and Active Objects
The old object - oriented philosophy of looking at every software object as an encapsulation of methods and data is flawed , in my opinion .
Every operation ( method ) should be viewed as an object in its own right : it waits for a signal to perform an action and emits an output signal immediately afterwards .
The principle of complementarity forces us to classify software objects into active ( e.g. , sensors and effectors ) and passive ( properties , data variables ) categories .
Even data should be classified into complementary types ( e.g. , positive and negative numbers , true and false values , etc . . ) .
The right metaphor draws a clear distinction between behaving entities ( active objects ) and their environment or domain ( passive objects ) .
Cells and Components
In COSA , an active object is called a cell and a cell can be either a sensor or an effector .
A passive object is just a data operand , i.e. , a variable property or a constant .
A group of passive objects is called a domain or territory .
A component is analogous to a country .
It encapsulates the active objects and their territory .
Passive objects can be shared among several active objects belonging to the same territory but are never shared across territories , except when passing messages .
This is described in detail in the Software Composition page .
Extreme Simplicity
If it is not simple , it is wrong .
Simplicity is a natural consequence of applying the principle of complementarity .
Every object or concept in COSA is stripped of unnecessary complexity .
No algorithmic construct ( e.g. , IF / THEN / ELSE , WHILE , GOSUB , GOTO , DO WHILE , DO UNTIL , etc… ) is allowed .
COSA Program Active Objects Passive Objects Sensors Effectors Data Operands
As seen above , a COSA program or component is just a collection of active objects ( sensors and effectors ) on the one hand , and the environment ( data or passive objects ) on the other .
Nothing more and nothing less .
As will be seen later in the discussion of the COSA operating system , these objects are represented graphically with a minimum number of icons .
An active object 's type ( sensor or effector ) is immediately recognizable .
This , in effect , does away with a major part of the " essential complexity " of software that Dr. Brooks alluded to in his " No Silver Bullet " paper .
Causality
One of the strengths of hardware logic is the clear distinction it makes between cause and effect , i.e. , between events and reactions .
The same distinction must exist in software .
The essence of software is this : a computer program is a reactive entity that detects changes in its environment and acts on it .
This makes it easy for the developer to determine which actions are taken and why .
The upshot is high program comprehensibility .
Total Vision Unresolved dependencies are the leading cause of software failures in complex systems :
A critical property or variable is changed by one part of a program , unbeknownst to the other parts .
Blind code is the bane of programmers and managers who are given the task of maintaining complex legacy algorithmic systems .
Even a minor modification is likely to introduce one or more unforeseen side effects .
By contrast , a COSA system has what I call ' total vision . '
It is a mechanism based on complementarity that automatically resolves all data dependencies , leaving nothing to chance .
The identification and resolution of dependencies must be effected both at the cell level ( in - memory data ) and at the component level ( mass storage data ) .
Total vision makes it possible to eliminate unwanted side effects and opens the way to the creation of extremely complex yet robust systems .
Visual Software Construction COSA supports the notion that software should be composed from a few simple , visually - depicted objects as opposed to being written in a syntactic language .
Developers should concentrate on application design and requirements and should not have to worry about syntax and spelling .
They certainly should not have to learn to decipher keywords based on a language ( usually English ) that may not be their native language .
Software construction should consist almost entirely of using a small number of simple graphical icons to connect objects together to form higher level components .
Pre - built , plug - compatible components can be effortlessly selected from a repository and joined together to form larger applications .
Just click , drag and drop .
Automating a large part of programming is guaranteed to do wonders for both productivity and reliability .
Programming by Design Software development traditionally goes through several phases such as requirement analysis , design , programming ( including compiling ) and testing .
Project COSA proposes to combine all phases into one .
Good software design under COSA means bug - free code that fulfills requirements from the start .
When the design is finished , i.e. , when all requirements are met , the application is ready for deployment .
There is no distinction between the application development tool and the application design tool .
In addition , a COSA application under development is always " running . "
Most additions and modifications can be tested instantly without the need to recompile and re-launch the application .
The promise of the COSA software model is as simple as it is revolutionary .
A COSA program is guaranteed to be completely free of internal defects regardless of its complexity .
I call it the COSA Reliability Principle or CRP .
The principle is based primarily on the knowledge that a COSA program works essentially like a logic circuit .
More details on the CRP can be found in the COSA operating system page .
Slower Performance
The main disadvantage of COSA will be slightly slower performance than pure assembly or compiled code .
This is because the objects are interpreted .
But this is not such a big problem nowadays , as the performance of processors continues to obey Moore 's law .
For now , the COSA model must use an interpreter but only because current CPUs are optimized for conventional algorithmic software .
Eventually , when the COSA model becomes widely adopted by the computer software industry ( hopefully the software reliability crisis will make sure of that ) , chip manufacturers will have to follow suit by designing their CPUs to embrace the new paradigm .
As an added bonus , only the COSA model makes it possible to design a fine - grain multicore CPU in an MIMD execution environment .
See How to Design a Fine - Grain , Self - Balancing , Multicore CPU .
It is possible to create a COSA compiler that generates fast optimized compiled code to be run as a standalone embedded program or as an application to be run in an existing OS .
Performance would be at least on a par with if not better than hand - written code .
This is fine for embedded systems and as a bridge solution for legacy systems but it is inadequate for a full - blown operating system which will have to run multiple synchronous applications concurrently .
Note that the COSA execution kernel described in the next page will be no slower than other code interpreters .
FORTH is a case in point .
FORTH interpreters have certainly proven their performance adequacy for all sorts of real time applications , especially in embedded and robotic systems .
Dedicated FORTH processors also exist that can execute FORTH code directly , resulting in unparalleled increases in performance .
My hope is that the same thing will happen with COSA .
Unfamiliarity Another disadvantage of COSA is unfamiliarity .
COSA is a radically different environment than what most people ( with the exception of hardware designers ) are used to .
Most programmers are trained to use traditional programming languages and may have a hard time switching to a development system that discards all the familiar algorithmic constructs .
There is also the problem of programmer prejudice .
Many wrongly feel that visual development systems can never be powerful enough to suit their needs .
The other side of the coin is that non-programmers will have no problem learning COSA .
Legacy Systems
The ideal environment is one in which everything , from the operating system components to the applications , works according to COSA principles .
Unfortunately , the world has already invested trillions of dollars and countless man-hours in legacy systems .
There is a huge algorithmic infrastructure already in place , one which will not go away overnight .
Regardless of how great the advantages of the new paradigm are , it will take much time and effort to displace the old systems .
Fortunately , standalone COSA applications can easily be made to work within an existing OS .
These applications can migrate to pure COSA environments at a later date , when these become common place .
Chicago - ON Aug. 5 , Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain announced his intention to carry out a series of new antiterrorism measures , including deporting foreign nationals who justify the use of " violence to further a person 's beliefs " ; authorizing the denaturalization of British citizens who engage in " extremism " ; and legislating a new " offense of condoning or glorifying terrorism . "
After the July 7 bombings in London , it is understandable that the Mr. Blair would want to deal firmly with those who incite violence .
Although the loss of life and property caused by the Sept. 11 attacks far exceeded that in London , the United States was at least spared the constitutional dilemma of having to deal with a situation in which people in the United States encouraged American citizens to take part in the violence .
But suppose that had been the case on Sept. 11 , or suppose such a situation were to arise in the future .
Would we respond any differently than the British ?
The United States has a long and unfortunate history of overreacting to the fears and anxieties of wartime and excessively restricting the freedom of speech .
This was so , for example , in 1798 , when the United States was on the verge of war with France , and during the First World War .
In both instances , the United States made it unlawful for any person to criticize the president , Congress or the government .
Of course , Mr. Blair is not calling for such a far - reaching ban on seditious utterance .
Rather , he is targeting only speech that glorifies or justifies acts of terrorism .
On its face , this seems sensible .
But as Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter noted in 1951 , speech that extols political violence is often " coupled " with sharp " criticism of defects in our society . "
For that reason , Justice Frankfurter said , there is an important public interest " in granting freedom to speak their minds " even to those who advocate the use of force to bring about political change .
A democratic society must protect itself against violent attack , but it cannot do so by preventing its citizens from hearing even sinister criticism that defends the use of violence .
AMERICANS justify their country 's comparatively high social inequality by emphasising its equality of opportunity .
The implication is that it is talent and hard work , not inherited privilege , which separate the rich from the poor .
The linchpin of such a meritocratic perspective is the educational system , which effectively allows access to the top of the socioeconomic ladder through the process of university admissions .
America 's big three universities ( Harvard , Yale and Princeton ) have for centuries created and reproduced the national elite , and have long sworn fealty to the principle of egalitarian opportunity .
But in “ The Chosen ” , an encyclopedic and engaging account of their admissions over the last century , Jerome Karabel , a professor of sociology at the University of California , Berkeley , demolishes their historical claim to be bastions of meritocracy .
More provocatively , he questions the whole idea of whether you can define merit objectively , and instead uses painstaking archival research to prove that , over the years , the Ivy League universities have defined and redefined merit according to their shifting institutional priorities .
“ The Chosen ” highlights two critical turning points : the birth in the 1920s of selective admissions that introduced subjective non-academic merit as a criteria for acceptance , and the universities ' dramatic shift in the direction of socioeconomic inclusivity in the 1960s , when they re-tooled the concept of merit to open their doors to racial minorities and women .
When Mr Karabel picks up the story shortly after 1900 , the colleges were becoming increasingly concerned about the number of Jews who were passing the entrance exams .
Since the Protestant upper classes who paid tuition bills had deserted other universities , notably Columbia , where “ Hebrew ” enrolments were deemed excessive , administrators regarded the increased Jewish presence as both a cultural insult and a threat to their institutional viability .
As a result , the colleges limited the size of their classes and began to reject students by creating a definition of merit that was expressly designed to justify quotas on Jewish applicants .
Academic achievement would play second fiddle to the character and manliness thought to be inculcated by prestigious boarding schools .
Jews ( limited to 15 % of the class at Harvard and 10 % at Yale ) were deemed lacking in these attributes .
In the words of a former Harvard dean of admissions , Wilbur Bender , Jews were “ effeminates , the precious and affected , the unstable ” , while private school boys were “ virile , masculine , red - blooded he - men ” .
The three universities continued to find character almost exclusively in wealthy Protestant boys until the 1960s , when external social upheaval changed their institutional priorities .
The student takeovers of university buildings and the violent race riots of that era caused administrators to fear for campus security , and they sought to avoid such disturbances by admitting ( and , implicitly , co-opting ) more black students .
Since few black applicants had high test scores , the admissions definition of merit again had to be turned upside down .
Character suddenly stemmed from socioeconomic adversity rather than privilege .
Once the principle of diversity as merit was established , all - male Yale and Princeton were hardly in a position to reject the demands of the feminist movement for co-education , which they implemented around 1970 .
The central thesis that Mr Karabel draws from this history is that the universities have always determined their merit criteria according to the admissions outcomes that would suit their institutional interests , rather than the other way around .
Although he credits the three universities with becoming more accessible to the underprivileged , he notes that even today , the wealthy are still vastly overrepresented among their student bodies .
This is partly due to the donation - friendly admissions preferences still given to athletes and children of alumni , which he concludes should be abolished .
But eliminating these practices wo n't turn these institutions into a meritocratic mecca because , as Mr Karabel argues , the concept of meritocracy itself is strategic and flexible , and often in outright conflict with egalitarian aims .
“ Those who are able to define ‘ merit ' , ” he writes , “ will almost invariably possess more of it , and those with greater resources — cultural , economic , and social — will generally be able to ensure that the educational system will deem their children more meritorious . ”
Even today , efforts at Harvard to place more emphasis on the sciences ( potentially replacing some wealthier white students with nerdy Asian - Americans ) have attracted criticism that they might make the student body too one - dimensional instead of iconoclastic and well - rounded — exactly the same style of disparaging argument used to justify the Jewish quotas of yesteryear .
As the book concludes , the unsettling lesson to be learned from a century of purported Ivy League meritocracy is that “ the ideal of a meritocracy ... is inherently unattainable . ”

Was fehlt | Zeichen und Wunder Wer verkehrt verkehrt Als Riesenmaschine - Leserin Maria Jähne uns auf den Magic Roundabout aufmerksam machte , glaubten wir zunächst , sie hätte uns die technische Zeichnung eines australischen Kühlwassersystems geschickt , das auch die antipodische Abflussstrudelrichtung auf der Südhalbkugel miteinbezieht .
( Dieses Bild wurde vorsichtshalber entfernt und taucht wieder auf , sobald sich die Autorin oder der Autor um die Klärung der Bildrechte gekümmert hat . )
Zumindest mit Australien lagen wir nicht vollkommen falsch , denn es handelt sich um einen Kreisverkehrkreisverkehr in England , wo die Leute links fahren wie auch in Japan , Australien und auf dem Mars .
Der Magic Roundabout ist ein aus fünf kleinen Kreisverkehren zusammengesetzer Überkreisverkehr , führt die fünf verkehrsreichsten Strassen in Swindon zusammen und soll angeblich die Unfallgefahr gesenkt haben , obwohl immer wieder von weinenden Touristen berichtet wird , die ihren Wagen am Strassenrand abgestellt haben und auf Godot warten , der ihnen dort durchhelfen könnte .
Es kann Euer Ernst nicht sein .

Nun ist Nationalismus eine der verabscheungswürdigsten Eigenschaften überhaupt , es handelt sich dabei im Prinzip um Kinderfickerei auf Staatsebene , nämlich eigene Interessen ohne Rücksicht auf Schwächere durchzusetzen .
Trotzdem ist es richtig und notwendig , über die Schwächen anderer Völker ab einer gewissen Grenze nicht hinwegzusehen , sondern darauf aufmerksam zu machen .
Das kann passieren , indem man sagt : " Liebe Polen , ihr habt mit 54,04 % einen Staatspräsidenten gewählt , der die Todesstrafe wieder einführen will und extrem homophobe Politik macht , seid ihr gestört ?
Dringende Bitte um Korrektur ! "
Das kann aber auch passieren , indem man die Engländer im Allgemeinen und die Swindoner im Besonderen für ihren Magic Roundabout auslacht , am besten mit den Worten " Hitler wäre stolz auf Euren Grosskreisverkehr ! "
Dieses Lachen hat dann eben nichts mit Nationalismus zu tun , sondern mit einer
Art globalem Zivilisationsausgleich .
Nebenbei gesagt wäre ich sehr froh , wenn Deutschland endlich mal für seine erbärmlich mut - und linienlose Innenpolitik ausgelacht würde .
Sascha Lobo | Dauerhafter Link | Kommentare ( 4 ) Kommentar # 1 von MartinMustermann : Dem Swindon Magic Roundabout hat auch Jasper Fforde in einem der Thursday - Next - Bücher ein Denkmal geschrieben .

When the contest was held last October , none of the eight entrants made it all the way up the ribbon .
But Mr. Jones 's Snowstar machine traveled farthest , all of 20 feet .
The hexagonal array of solar cells , powering two pairs of rollers that shimmied up the ribbon , was judged Most Likely to Win in the 2006 challenge , set for August .
The prize has been increased to $ 250,000 this year , from $ 50,000 .
To win , the climbers must make it up the ribbon in less than a minute .
So far , 19 teams have signed up , nearly twice as many as in 2005 .
Another well - known high - tech contest , the Darpa Grand Challenge , also had disappointing results when it started in 2004 .
The all - robot off - road rally , sponsored by the Pentagon 's fringe science arm , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , or Darpa , attracted dozens of competitors .
But none of the vehicles made it past the seventh mile of the 150 - mile course , largely because of navigation problems .
A year later , five unmanned cars crossed the finish line .
That included robots from leading universities like Stanford and Carnegie Mellon as well as one from the Gray Insurance Company , which had no experience in robotics but whose owners had a personal interest in the competition .
The Gray team was one of the last to enter the contest , and it had a major setback when Hurricane Katrina wrecked its New Orleans workshop .
Nevertheless , it beat out vehicles built by leading computer - science researchers and backed by defense contractors .
It did so well that it has pulled some employees from the insurance side of the business , allowing them to focus on the company 's new venture : robotic cars for the military and other entities .
" I never thought I 'd work in defense , " said Paul Trepagnier , a software development manager at Gray .
" I 'm a Tom Clancy fan .
But that 's the extent .
I mean , I 'm just a programmer in an insurance company . "
Many of NASA 's contests also center on robotics .
The Telerobotic Construction Challenge , scheduled for August 2007 , requires a team of machines to assemble items with minimal human supervision .
The idea is to let robots , instead of astronauts , build shelters and machinery on the moon and Mars .
In the Regolith Excavation Challenge , set for May 2007 , an autonomous machine will have to dig through 24 square meters of simulated moon rock .
A separate Regolith Oxygen competition , scheduled for 2008 , will be held for robots that can extract oxygen from the stones .
Some contests will be held annually ; others will be one - time events .
NASA funds robotics research through conventional contracts too , and it uses Small Business Innovation Research grants to back companies outside the industry 's mainstream .
But the paperwork involved in the innovation research grants , called S.B.I.R.'s , can be intimidating .
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Friday 24 April 2009
The article below , in which Erwin James recounted his experiences in the Foreign Legion , contains information which is untrue .
James was in the Foreign Legion for a time but his claim to have served with one of its regiments in Beirut in the summer of 1982 was false and a paragraph , which purported to describe his experiences there , was fiction .
He did not join the Foreign Legion until the end of 1982 , by which time his regiment had returned from Beirut .
The article also suggested that James accompanied his regiment on missions to Djibouti and the Central African Republic .
While these were regular regiment duties , James did not go there .
He did , as he said in the piece , go to Chad .
In a more recent article James said he joined the Foreign Legion in 1981 .
That was also untrue .
In both articles , we should have made clear that names and / or nationalities of some individuals had been changed so that they could not be identified ( Legion of honour , 13 January 2006 , page 8 , G2 , and ' God help anyone who weakened ' : my life in the French Foreign Legion , 25 February 2009 , page 2 , G2 ) .
The readers ' editor will write about this in her weekly column on 27 April 2009 ) .
" Being a legionnaire is easy , " said the captain , " and being a civilian is easy .
It is the change from being a civilian to becoming a legionnaire that some find difficult . "
It was a month since I had walked into the recruitment office of the Légion Etrangère in the heart of the Citadelle in Lille , northern France .
The night before , I 'd got drunk on cheap wine and fallen asleep in an alley .
A kind soul had thrown a piece of old carpet over me which had protected me from the heavy January frost and probably kept me alive .
Grimy and bedraggled , I limped out on to the main thoroughfare to enlist in my new life .
I had spent most of my last few borrowed pounds on a ferry ticket from Dover to Calais and then jumped a train to Lille before blowing the little money I had left on the wine .
After leaving behind a trail of devastation , and the prospect of many years in prison in Britain , I had come to France to join the Foreign Legion .
Reading the reports last week about " flabby " British recruits being put to shame in the Legion by battle - hardened eastern Europeans , I had a sharp pang of nostalgia .
For I remember how grateful I was as a young man , many years ago , when the Legion offered me the chance of a way out of deep trouble .
I had led a reckless and undisciplined life , and was in very poor physical and mental condition .
Most of what I had heard or read about the Legion had left me feeling that it was a place where only desperate men would go .
Well , I was certainly desperate .
It was 5.30 am and still dark as the captain , flanked by a sergeant and three scowling corporals , continued his welcoming address .
He had already given our sleepy - eyed group , his latest batch of " engagé voluntaires " , the same speech in French , Spanish and German , his native tongue .
We learned later that he was fluent in nine languages .
My section , 40 - strong , had arrived at the Legion 's basic training camp in Castelnaudary , close to the Spanish border , from the selection centre in Aubagne in Provence the day before .
Potential recruits are shipped from recruitment posts around France to Aubagne every day .
Three weeks of rigorous physical and psychological assessments follow , including interrogations by members of the Legion 's secret police , the Deuxième Bureau , hunting for criminals on behalf of Interpol .
We were told that only one in 12 applicants made it to basic training .
Before leaving Aubagne we had each been given new equipment .
On that first morning at Castel we were ordered to lay out our kit neatly in front of us on groundsheets , ready , we thought , for the captain 's inspection .
" We are going to help you make the change , " the captain continued , " but you will have to work very hard . "
Without warning the corporals began kicking our shiny new kit in all directions .
Soon , mess tins , uniforms , bars of soap and boots were all mangled and mixed up together in unruly piles .
A Chilean recruit named Garcia , with whom I 'd become friendly at the recruitment station in Lille , swore in Spanish .
Two of the corporals raced at him and began screaming into his face .
" Seulement français !
Seulement français ! "
They pushed him to the ground and screamed again , " Allez ! Pompez ! "
Garcia was made to do push - ups while we gathered our stuff together .
Then we were ordered back to our billet to change into PE kit for the first of what were to become regular dawn runs .
Garcia was still struggling with his push - ups when we returned , exhausted , an hour later .
Our first lesson : on no account were we allowed to speak anything other than French , even when we swore .
Our instruction was to last for four months .
The men in my section were in various states of fitness when we started out .
Several had had some previous military experience .
One , a Frenchman who joined claiming to be Swiss ( apart from the officer class , French citizens are barred from the Legion and join in disguise ) , was rumoured to be the disgraced son of a French regular army colonel .
His discipline and informed understanding of military ways indicated that there might be some truth in it .
On the whole we were a motley crew : some tall , some skinny , many flabby , a few who were quite fit .
Around half the section were French .
There were a number of Germans , a man from Iceland , another from Sri Lanka and one other Brit .
I made some friends : Garcia , who sang and played the guitar he'd brought with him from Chile ; Max , a bankrupt Austrian dentist who spoke flawless English ; and Henni , a former marathon runner from Morocco .
We formed strong bonds as we marched through the foothills of the Pyrenees , shot at targets on the rifle ranges with our Famas 5.56s , and broke the ice for weekly swims in the local reservoir - relentlessly urged on by the corporals , one of whom , a big Tahitian , had only one eye but could shoot his rifle more accurately than anyone else in the regiment .
We were taught about Camarone , a celebrated battle where 60 legionnaires fought to the last man against several thousand Mexicans in 1863 .
We were punched and kicked , made to dig holes and then fill them in for no discernible reason , and regularly dragged out of our bunks in the early hours and made to march and sing around the quadrangle under floodlights .
( Singing while marching is a great tradition of the Legion - and an ingenious way of learning French . )
And we undertook the " képi march " , the hardest task of all .
The trek lasts for four days and nights , through the Pyrenean foothills , during which we stopped only for brief moments of respite and sporadic bouts of sleep .
When it was over , we lit a huge bonfire and drank wine and sang our Legion songs until it was time for our captain to present each of us with our képi , the famous Legion white cap .
" You must wear it with honour and fidélité , " he instructed .
" A vos ordres , mon capitaine ! " we replied in chorus .
By then , the differences in our backgrounds , or the condition we'd been in before , had little relevance .
Those of us with the will ( in my case , the desperation ) to succeed had been taken in , revitalised , reprogrammed and finally regurgitated as fully fledged legionnaires .
There were 28 of us left in the section at the end of the four months ( nine had deserted and three were hospitalised and medically discharged ) .
Those of us who remained were fitter and healthier than we had ever been in our lives , and as close as a family , an ideal that the Legion deliberately sets out to achieve - " Legio Patria Nostra " is one of many Legion mottos , which roughly translates as " the Legion is our homeland " .
We had been turned from a band of straggling strangers into a tight unit of formidable soldiers , brothers in arms basking in our reputation as fearless and feared warriors , and eager for whatever adventures lay ahead .
Yet many of us cried at the station as our captain bade us farewell and " Bonne chance " on the platform at Castelnaudary station .
From Castel we were dispersed to regiments around the world : Djibouti , French Guiana , Tahiti ... some went to regiments in mainland France .
Max went to work in the Legion 's administration dept in Aubagne ; Garcia , Henni and I were dispatched to Corsica to join the 2ème Régiment étranger de parachutistes - the Legion 's only parachute regiment .
We took the ferry from Marseille to Ajaccio , proud to be mixing with passengers in our khaki summer uniforms , our new kepis gleaming in the May sunshine .
We had learned about the 2nd REP during basic training .
It was a regiment with a glorious history , renowned for operations in Algeria , Chad , Somalia and many other trouble spots across the world .
We joined the promo ( the parachute training class ) , where seven others who had arrived the week before us were waiting along with two corporals and a Polish sergeant , a Kolwezi veteran , who would be our instructors for the next three weeks .
Our new teachers were fiercer and even less forgiving than those at Castel .
Getting us out of bed in the early hours to don parachutes and jump off bedside lockers was a favourite jape .
" Allez ! Saut ! "
Loading our Bergens with rocks for the " sac à dos " , the 8 km run with full pack , was another .
" Vite ! Vite ! " they screamed .
It was a relief when the time came for us to jump for real from a Transall C160 transport plane .
Henni twisted his back on only his second jump ; he was sent to the mainland , after which we were told he was medically discharged .
Every other member of our promo graduated as parachutists and were awarded silver wings to wear on our breast pockets , complementing the rest of the " guidy guidy " ( regimental badges and lanyard . )
We celebrated with wine and songs and Garcia and I were allocated to the 1er Compagnie Commando .
Two months later , in summer 1982 , we were in Beirut , helping to keep the peace .
I had heard that before the 1982 invasion Beirut had been known as the Paris of the Middle East .
It could still be imagined , though its wide boulevards and once beautiful buildings were now pockmarked with rocket craters and holes drilled by heavy machine gun and small arms fire .
Our section was based in the west of the city , bunkered in an old brandy warehouse .
We met American marines and Italian infantrymen , and talked weaponry .
We had no politics .
Our only allegiance was to the Legion .
But it was hard not to feel for the plight of the civilian population .
We stood by as open - backed land cruisers , heaving with laughing , keffiyeh - wearing Arab soldiers firing Kalashnikovs , hurtled through the streets to their evacuation .
Many of us had never heard gunfire before that was not our own , but nobody gave any indication that they were afraid .
The eternal sunshine and clear blue sky seemed to shed an incongruous light on this battle - scarred city .
The mission in Beirut complete , we returned to Calvi to be presented with our Médaille d'Outre - Mer ( overseas medal ) and Médaille Défense National .
We were " bluebeats " ( novices ) no longer .
From then on we spent our time training - endlessly .
The regime was full and rigorous , with every type of sport or hobby available , but living in constant anticipation of a mission d'outre - mer could also be tedious .
Drinking cold beer by the case was a favourite pastime .
Some people got bored and got drunk ; others got bored and deserted .
A 25 - strong contingent of Brits , known to the rest as " le mafia anglais " , dominated the Foyer ( regiment bar ) at weekends .
Whenever there was a bordel ( violent occurrence ) , invariably members of the British mafia would be involved .
Patrol missions to the former French territories of Djibouti and the Central African Republic were regular duties of the regiment .
Tours of duty lasted four months and were routine .
Occasional border incidents , attempted incursions or territorial disagreements provided moments of excitement , but otherwise our purpose was simply to provide reassurance that France would always ensure stability in the region .
A bonus was that , for the period in which we were in Africa , our pay almost doubled .
When the tours were over we returned to Corsica to enjoy three weeks of leave , before settling back into a life of constant preparation and training .
I found that being a legionnaire presented an ordered way of life that offered the possibility of redemption from past sins and failures .
For me , it was the family I had never had .
When , in 1983 , the orders came for us to go to Chad to support the Chadian government against Libyan - backed rebels , we expected real conflict .
" C'est la guerre " echoed through the camp , a mixture of excitement and anticipation of serious conflict .
It turned out not to be the case exactly - there was a war , it just was n't our war .
We spent weeks travelling through the desert in Willis jeeps and French camions , stopping every few days .
When most of a platoon of French regular soldiers were killed after disturbing a booby - trapped tank , our section cleared up afterwards .
But we loved being legionnaires in the desert .
For young men like me , who did n't really belong anywhere else , it was like being given a home .
After a few weeks in Chad , during which I spent my time mounting desert patrols and escorting PoWs , trouble flared in neighbouring Cameroon .
My section spent the night sitting , back to back , on the runway of the capital Ndjamena , another once beautiful French colonial city , weighed down with arms and ammunition waiting for the order to jump on rebels who had taken Cameroon 's airport .
Our captain told us it was likely few of us would return .
To a man we were willing to give our lives to the Legion .
But that did n't stop the wave of relief when the order never came .
They say your past has a way of catching up with you .
I used to wonder if it would .
Four months later , on my last day of a week 's leave in Paris , I heard a banging on the window of a restaurant as I passed by .
It was Garcia , who had been sent home after being wounded in a firefight in Chad .
He was still bandaged and in pain , but grinning broadly .
" Hombre ! " he shouted .
It was good to see my friend .
That night we drank beer and Garcia played his guitar .
Four days later I was arrested and never saw any of my comrades again .
But I never forgot what I gained from my Legion experience .
It got me through the difficult times that were waiting .
If Brits are failing in basic training now , it 's not because they are not in good condition .
It 's because they do n't need to be there badly enough .
Playing With Fire America and the Dollar Illusion
The dollar is still the world 's reserve currency , even though it has n't deserved this status for a long time .
The devaluation of the dollar can't be stopped -- it can only be deferred .
The result could be a world economic crisis .

THE NOBLE TALE OF SIR NEVILLE DE FLYNN & THE SERPENTES ON THE VESSEL
maad yn to Englysshe from the Frensshe bokes by Sir Frank Malory
chapter the ist
Hit befelle uppon a day that SIR SEAN de JEHANNE , who was a yonge knight and a gentil , dide wander as adventures wolde gyde hym nere to the fayre citee of Honolulle .
He lepede on his hors from manye an heigh hille yn slowe mocioun yn the maner of a goode knighte and a valyaunte .
And whan it was nyghe none , Sir Sean cam to a grete bridge that was made of oold by the Romayns , and from that bridge did hange doun - ward an eremyte whos visage was ful hewn and bledde and al his clothes and the place aboute weren bloode red .
And Sir Sean askede hym what he did ther and wherefor he was hanged and who had so grievousli him woundede ; ‘ Fle from this place , Sir Knight , ’ he seyde , ‘ For the man cometh who did thes woundes to me and he is a grete kynge but a felon and a traytour and hys name is KYNGE EDICHIM and he hath doon this to me by cause ich haue stood ayeinst hys grete outrages and felonies . ’
Then Sir Sean did see manye knightes comynge to that place and so he hid hymself among the bushes .
And Kyng Edichim ycam wyth his knightes and dide kille the eremyte .
And Sir Sean made to fle but his bootes made a sounde and the knightes spyede hym and gave hym chase .
And thogh he scapede from hem , thei sawe wher he rode and knew of his lodging .
Therwithal Kyng Edichim sente thre of his knightes to Sir Seanes lodging for to slayen hym for he had sene hys foule deede .
And thus cam aftir vespers Sir Stuntman Number Oon and Sir Stuntman Number Two , son of Expendable Extra who had done manye deedes in the dayes of Uther Pendragon , and wyth hem Sir Stuntman Number Thre .
And so the miscreant knightes wolde break ope the doore of Sir Seanes room and slaye him foullie , but that SIR NEVILLE DE FLYNN cam and seyde to Sir Sean , ‘ Sir Knight , if thou shalt do my biddynge than thou shalt scape wyth thy lyf , ’ and bad Sir Sean to hye hym from that place .
And then Sir Neville made hym redy , wyth one spere he smote hem downe al thre over ther horses croups .
This kynde of thynge was ful yn his style , for hys verye wallet hath ‘ bad motherswyvere ’ on it ywrit .
chapter the iinde
Then Sir Neville told Sir Sean that they must cross the see to the court of the grete King Arthur , for Arthures puissance coud bringe Kynd Eidichim to justise .
For Sir Neville was yn the Feudal Bureau of Investigacioun .
And so the two knightes cam to the coost of the see and ther thei sawe a rich vessel hilled over with red silk and thei cam to yt .
‘ Master mariners , ’ seyde Sir Neville , ‘ We muste make passage yn yower firste - classe section , for I bringe a witnesse to the courte of Kynge Arthur . ’
And the mariners and the maydes on the boate assentede , thogh manye a rich burgois dide grucchen much at levynge first classe for coache .
And thus the mariners made hem redye to sayle across the grete see .
In first classe Sir Neville and Sir Sean talkede of matirs of prowesse and knighthode , and doun in coache , manye a stereotype did sitte and make conversacioun .
Ther was a PRIORESSE , who lovede hir smalle dog , and also a SQUIRE , who mad manye songes of rappe and had TWO FAT KNIGHTES wyth him , and also a WOMAN WYTH A BABYE AND AN ACCENTE , who coud muche of plesaunte folke remedyes and TWO FOUNDLINGES who travelid all al oon , and an ANTISOCIALE ENGLISHMAN and also a gret manye EXPENDABLES .
And Kyng Edichim bethoghte hymself how Sir Neville was a man of muche power and coud nat be bestede by knightes ; and so Edichim turnede hym to trecherie and sorcerie .
Withinne the hulle of the shipe he had privilye yputte manye a caske fulle of serpentes and wormes and foul addres , and therto he put aboute the boate a philtre ycleped Far - Amoun by the Arabes , the which maketh serpentes to freke the helle oute and starte juste bitinge eny oon thei see .
And wyth alchemy he sette the lockes of the caskes for to bursten whan the boate was yn the middel of the see .
And yn this wise nat oon of the securitee gardes did knowe of the ambusshe of the serpentes that was to be , even thogh thei did make al the passengers remove her toothpickes and lettre - openeres and especiallye ther jarres of oyntmentz and sportes - drinkes .
And thus the vessel departed wyth the serpentes hidden vpon it .
chapter the iiirde
So whan the ship had on the ocean saylede for two houres and was on the rollinge wawes of the see , anon the lockes of the caskes breste forth and the snakes weren loosed .
Right so the hoolde of the shippe was fulle of al maner of serpentes that hisse and crawl vpon the erthe , such as amphisbanae and aspides , vipers the which aren sum tyme called berardes , and bosk - addres and cheldires whos bite causeth shakynge and sodein deeth , egges - wermes and water - naddres , slow - wormes and ophites and manye othir thinges that movede serpentli .
And syn thei had brethede depe of the Far - Amoun , thei were wood as if thei weren on cracke .
Thus cam the snakes in the coache seccioun of the vessel , and ther was much noyse and screminge and manye EXPENDABLES weren eten and in the naughtye partes ybitten .
The ANTISOCIALE ENGLISHMAN dide throwe the dogge of the PRIORESSE to the serpentes for to make hem delaye , and yet he too was eten by a grete wyrm .
And the SQUIRE did showe that for all of his bling he was but a cowarde .
And the WOMAN WYTH A BABYE AND AN ACCENT dide scape wyth her babye and her accent .
Sir Sean herde the noyse and fayne wolde haue gon doun to the coache seccioun .
For neyther he nor Sir Neville had sene the snakes , but herde onnlie the cryes from below and knew nat what happede .
And so Sir Sean got hym up to move but Sir Neville seyde , ‘ Sir Knight , whan first we met ich toolde thee that if thou sholdst do my biddynge , thou wolde lyue , and in ower aventurez it hath happede thus that thou hast no reson to distruste me .
Thou must bringe thy witnesse to Kyng Arthurez court , and thus stay thee heere the while ich figure out what the helle the noyse ys aboute .
Mesemeth peraventure that the in - shippe filme ys Failure to Launch and alle folke do screme in terror at the mismatchede romantique payringe of Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew “ Nat Luke nor Owen ” McConaughey . ’
And so Sir Sean stayede put while Sir Neville went doun to ward the noyse .
chapter the ivthe
Sir Neville cam to wher the folke of the shippe wyth the snakes yfought , and he sawe the bodyes of the dede and the sight grieved hym sore , for the battel had waxed passinge hard and the folke had little wherewithal to defend hemselves .
And Sir Neville then fared wood as a lion and with his swerd he cutte in twayne the snakes that at him lept .
‘ Builde a walle for to kepen out the serpentes ’ he seyde , and the folk obeyed hym and piled up her luggage , the whiche did stop the onslaught of the serpentes as an othir walle had long agoon ystopped the onslaught of the Scottes .
And the WOMAN WYTH A BABYE AND AN ACCENT coud sum thyng of leechcraft and so put salues and poulticez on thos who had been bitten and yet had nat perisshed .
And oon of the FOUNDLINGES was bite and hys arm was sore sore .
And the SQUIRE was loosinge yt and seyd ‘ O Jesu , defend us from death and horrible maims !
For I see well we be in grete peril of death , for ther aren snakes on ower shippe and thei are angrie at sum thyng . ’
And Sir Neville seyde to him , ‘ Yes , I marvel how thei cam vnto this ship wythout wittynge of us alle .
Yet nowe ther beth litel hope but to fighte hem . ’
And Sir Neville and the SQUIRE and al men on the shippe alive who coud weapnes hold dide marche ayeinst the serpentes and do grete bataille and long war .
But the snakes were full of ire and of venym and were still passinge y- riled - uppe and thus gave grete assaut in returne .
And thus the battel stood wyth manye dede on eyther syde .
chapter the vthe and finale
Then Sir Neville and the men who with him fought did drawe togedir and Sir Neville seyde , ‘ Litel it availeth us to fighte wyth thes snakes .
By cause thei do not jouste as knightes do , nor do thei make fayre parlay whan thei aren captured , but rather in the nature of beestes thei bite the helle ovte of vs the whole tyme . ’
And thus thei made retreat to behinde the walle .
Then ther was a crashinge grete and terribil , and the sound of the sayles droppinge on to the decke .
In the winde the ship did founder .
Vp staires , Sir Sean did checke wyth the mariners and finde hem all y - slawe by the snakes , and the snakes had occupyed the wheel of the shippe and the mappe of navigacioun .
And Sir Sean cam doun and toold Sir Neville and Sir Neville was passinge wroth and seyde , ‘ That ys ynogh .
I haue hadde it wyth thes cursed by Seynt George snakes on this cursed by Seynt George shippe !’
‘ What haue ye seyde ? ’ askede the PRIORESSE then .
‘ I did curse the snakes , ’ seyde Sir Neville , ‘ and therwith the shippe , in the name of Seynt George who ys a patron of valour and chivalrie . ’
‘ Ywis , ’ seyde the PRIORESSE , ‘ yower cursinge hath borne good fruyt , for methinkede whan I herde ye speke thus that the arme of man , eek even of a mighti man swich as yowerself , is but a litel thinge compared to the grete power of God the which is dispensed thorow the mediacioun of the seyntez .
And thes serpentes the which do make werre ayeinst us aren figuraciouns of the sinne of ower firste parentes who weren by a serpent deceyved , and thus thei signifien that we sholde seke nat strengthe in knighthede but in prayere and devocioun .
For syn we face thes foule serpentes , mesemeth we must seeke succour and aide from the gret seynt who is the enemy ysworn of al maner of serpentes . ’
‘ Dang , babye , ’ seyde Sir Neville , ‘ ye speke gret wisdam . ’
And alle the crewe prayed to Seynt Patrick and thorow hys mercy the serpentes were slayne every oon of hem and the shippe came safelye to shore .
Good Lord saue us alle yn swich a maner as thou hast saved Danyhel in the liones den and Jonah in the wales bellye and saue us especiallye from Snakes on the See , in the name of Jesu ower Lord and Seynte Patrick
Complex decisions are best left to your unconscious mind to work out , according to a new study , and over - thinking a problem could lead to expensive mistakes .
The research suggests the conscious mind should be trusted only with simple decisions , such as selecting a brand of oven glove .
Sleeping on a big decision , such as buying a car or house , is more likely to produce a result people remain happy with than consciously weighing up the pros and cons of the problem , the researchers say .
Thinking hard about a complex decision that rests on multiple factors appears to bamboozle the conscious mind so that people only consider a subset of information , which they weight inappropriately , resulting in an unsatisfactory choice .
In contrast , the unconscious mind appears able to ponder over all the information and produce a decision that most people remain satisfied with
Ap Dijksterhuis at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands , and colleagues recruited 80 people for a series of lab - based and “ real - world ” tests .
The participants were provided with information and asked to make decisions about simple and complex purchases , ranging from shampoos to furniture to cars .

Snap decisions
In one of the tests , half of the participants were asked to ponder on the information they were given and then decide which among similar products to buy .
The other half were shown the information but then made to perform a series of puzzles including anagrams and simple arithmetic .
At the end of the puzzle session , the participants were asked to make a snap decision about the products .
“ We found that when the choice was for something simple , such as purchasing oven gloves or shampoo , people made better decisions – ones that they remained happy with – if they consciously deliberated over the information , ” says Dijksterhuis .
“ But once the decision was more complex such as for a house , too much thinking about it led people to make the wrong choice .
Whereas , if their conscious mind was fully occupied on solving puzzles , their unconscious could freely consider all the information and they reached better decisions . ”
Expectation counts
However , the unconscious mind appears to need some instruction .
“ It was only when people were told before the puzzles that they would need to reach a decision that they were able to come up with the right one , ” Dijksterhuis told New Scientist .
If they were told that none of what they had been shown was important before being given the puzzles , they failed to make satisfactory choices .
“ At some point in our evolution , we started to make decisions consciously , and we ’re not very good at it .
We should learn to let our unconscious handle the complicated things , ” Dijksterhuis says .

That was the question being asked today after French police said that three masked raiders who kidnapped the daughter - in - law and grandchildren of an arms warehouse manager in Nimes , were probably from the group .
The trio consisted of two men and one woman .
The abductors forced the female manager to open up the warehouse on Tuesday and took away around 350 pistols .
" Everything leads us to believe that it was Eta , " Nimes public prosecutor Robert Gelli said .
He cited " the mode of operation , the presence of a woman , the foreign accent of the individuals ... and of course , the nature of the objects stolen . "
After loading up the weapons into their vehicle , the robbers tied the manager up .
She escaped hours later , Gelli said .
The manager 's daughter - in - law and two grandchildren - one aged seven and one aged nine months - were held overnight in a car in a nearby village .
They broke free early the next day .
Spanish media reported that handcuffs taken off two French police officers by pistol - wielding Eta members in March had been used in the attack .
If confirmed , the robbery would be the first such act by Eta since it called the ceasefire on March 22 .
The group , which has historically only carried out attacks in Spain , has killed more than 800 people over the past four decades .
Over the past five years , however , police action both in Spain and France - where its command and logistics structure are traditionally based - has weakened it considerably .
Many saw its truce declaration as an attempt to negotiate a dignified exit from violence after more than two years in which , despite its efforts , it failed to kill anyone at all .
Most Spanish Basques , and most Spaniards , had hoped the ceasefire meant violent attempts to create a separate Basque were over .
The robbery comes as the Basque peace process was already going through a sticky patch .
Some 40 leading members of Batasuna , a banned separatist political party which is heavily involved in the process , and other separatist groups were formally accused with being Eta members on Tuesday .
Police acting on the orders of the supreme court began registering dozens of separatist social clubs and bars on Monday in San Sebastián , Bilbao , Vitoria , Durango and elsewhere .
The bars are also considered to be involved with Batasuna .
Outside one such bar in Bilbao , around 50 protesters gathered carrying placards with slogans such as " You will not stop us " , or " Get out of here and leave us alone . "
The socialist prime minister , José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero , has repeatedly warned that the peace process will be long and difficult .
He received unexpected support from Tony Blair during a visit to Madrid earlier this month .
" My experience of this is that sometimes there appears to be a blockage or you get diverted from the path you want to take , " Mr Blair said .
" But on the other hand , if the will is there and people apply the right type of what I call patient determination , in other words , understanding , if you are always doing the best , it does happen , " he added .
Unlike the Northern Irish peace process , however , there is no cross-party support for Mr Zapatero .
He is having to go ahead with the peace process without the backing of the opposition conservative People 's party , which accuses him of selling out to murderers .
Unconfirmed newspaper reports suggest that socialist government representatives and Eta leaders have been meeting secretly in Norway over recent weeks .
Mr Zapatero has suggested to Batasuna that it might , in effect , become legal again if its members founded a new party .
That was rejected by Batasuna , however , which wants to be able to stand again at elections with its old name .
For the process to advance , proposed talks on the Basque region 's future - bringing together pro-independence parties and mainstream ones favouring the status quo - must begin right away , the banned party said in a statement last week .
" Everything else are exercises in distraction and diversion , " the statement said .
Batasuna made no mention , however , of denouncing Eta 's violence as a condition for regaining legal status and taking part in the all - party talks , as demanded by Mr Zapatero .
Tuesday 's robbery now opens the possibility that Eta is rearming , and that it has run out of patience with peace .
What happened to her ass ?
It disappeared .

It only benefits her if her grandparents on her mothers side are taking care of her while her parents are out .

CAMBRIDGE , Mass. , Aug. 11 , 2006 --
A new type of microscopy invented by Xiaowei Zhuang and colleagues at Harvard University and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute delivers spatial resolution more than 10 times better than that of conventional optical microscopes , putting scientists tantalizingly close to the first crisp , ultra-resolution , real - time imaging of living biomolecules and cells .
The new technique can currently resolve objects as small as 20 nanometers , or 20 billionths of a meter , a resolution Zhuang says could be pushed , with further improvements , to molecular scale .
Zhuang , along with Michael J. Rust and Mark Bates at Harvard , describes stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy , or STORM , in the Aug. 9 online edition of the journal Nature Methods .
" We believe this technique has the potential to transform molecular and cellular imaging in biology , " says Zhuang , an HHMI investigator and professor of chemistry and chemical biology in Harvard 's Faculty of Arts and Sciences .
" High - resolution bio-imaging is now accomplished using electron microscopy , which requires a ' dead ' sample .
The scientific community has long hoped for a technique offering STORM 's attributes : touchless , gentle , real - time imaging of live biological samples at the molecular scale . "
At the heart of STORM 's success are fluorophores , glowing molecules that can be driven between a fluorescent and a dark state hundreds of times with repeated exposure to light with different colors .
Zhuang , Bates , and colleague Tim Blosser discovered such a fluorophore and described it in Physical Review Letters in 2005 .
" Scientists have long known that individual fluorophores can be localized to nanometer accuracy , " Zhuang said .
" However , light from fluorophores that are close to each other cannot easily be separated , making it very difficult to resolve these objects .
After we discovered this wonderful switchable fluorophore , we realized that it offers one solution to this problem . "
Their solution , described this week in Nature Methods , is to only activate a small fraction of the fluorophores at a time , imaging them and determining their location to nanometer resolution .
Rust and Bates attached fluorophores to antibodies , which can be engineered to attach in turn to many types of biomolecules .
Exposure of a fluorophore - bound biological sample to successive flashes of light of varying wavelengths activates different subsets of fluorophores , revealing their locations .
After many such still images are taken , they are merged into a single image -- a sea of glowing fluorophores clearly resolvable , for instance , along a strand of DNA or protein filament .
" The whole STORM imaging process currently takes several minutes to create a crisp imaging of a biological sample , " Zhuang said , " but we are fairly confident that we can ramp up the speed to virtually real - time .
Our next step is a molecular resolution , multi-color , real - time STORM for live object imaging . "

On Monday , August 14 , more than 125,000 students in northeastern Texas will head back to school .
And sadly , not one of them will be wearing a diamond - encrusted grill .
That 's because four districts in the region have taken the " pre-emptive " measure of barring students from wearing mouth jewelry of any kind , depressing thousands of gangstas - in - training and no doubt putting a serious dent in grill - master — and Houston native — Paul Wall 's business plans ( see " Newlywed Paul Wall Grilling With ' Girls , ' Wants To Chop And Screw Biggie " ) .
The ban , which was passed by the boards of trustees in the Arlington , Irving , Grand Prairie and DeSoto districts , aims to eliminate grills because they are , as one board member put it , " a major distraction issue . "
" It was starting to become a thing of , ' Who can come to school with the biggest grill ? ' " Arlington School Board President Sherri Wade said .
" And that 's not what school is supposed to be about .
I mean , those things are expensive — you can put diamonds in them , they 're gaudy — so let 's leave them in the videos or in the shopping malls . "
Wade , herself a teacher in a neighboring district , said there really has n't been an issue with grills in schools yet , but when the board of trustees met on June 15 to discuss Arlington 's dress code , banning them became a major priority .
" We have n't had any real problems with them now , and I'm of the belief that kids should be able to wear anything they want within reason , " she said .
" But having been in education for 16 years now , I 've seen plenty of trends come and go , and grills really appear to be on the rise .
So we decided to do some forward thinking and catch them before they really caught on . "
In the past , American schools have blocked students from wearing T - shirts bearing specific messages , baseball caps , baggy pants and camouflage clothing ( see " School Bans Camouflage Clothing To Defuse Immigration Debate " ) , citing health , security and concentration concerns .
And while grills might have gotten the kibosh in Texas , they certainly were n't the only body accoutrement that came under scrutiny .
The Arlington board also decided to prohibit students from wearing earlobe - stretching " gauges , " citing a concern for student safety .
" The athletes in the district are n't supposed to wear jewelry because it can get caught on a helmet or something like that , " Wade said .
" So we decided to ban [ gauges ] too , because imagine if two students passed in the halls and got their earlobes tangled . "
And Wade is quick to point out that she and the other members of the Arlington board of trustees are n't against students ' rights to express themselves .
After all , they were all high school students at one point too .
" I was in high school in the '70s , and we wore the same things then that kids wear now , so there 's not a lot that can shock me , " she laughed .
" I just wish the whole baggy thing would go away .
And I do n't want to see any [ breasts or rear ends ] .
Other than that , I think I leave it up to the kids to decide what to wear .
" It 's a judgment call , " she concluded .
" Feel free to wear your grills when you 're not in school , just take them out when you walk through these doors . "
NYT : Six - year , $ 4.7 b effort to slash Colombia 's coca crop has left price , quality , availability of cocaine on US streets unchanged RAW STORY
Published : Friday August 18 , 2006 Print This Email
This A six - year , $ 4.7 billion effort to slash Colombia 's coca crop has done little , according to an article slated for Saturday 's New York Times , RAW STORY has learned .
" The latest chapter in Americas long war on drugs  a six - year , $ 4.7 billion effort to slash Colombias coca crop  has left the price , quality and availability of cocaine on American streets virtually unchanged , " reports Juan Forero for The Times .
" The effort , begun in 2000 and known as Plan Colombia , had a specific goal of halving this countrys coca crop in five years , " the article continues .
" That has not happened , " Forero writes .
" Instead , drug policy experts say , coca , the essential ingredient for cocaine , has been redistributed to smaller and harder - to - reach plots , adding to the cost and difficulty of the drug war . "
Excerpts from article : # Bush administration officials say that coca farmers are on the run , and that the leftist guerrillas and right - wing paramilitaries who feed on drug profits are weaker than ever .
That has made Colombia , Washingtons closest ally in a tumultuous region , more stable , they say .
They argue that the plan has scored important successes , like a spike in the price of cocaine last year .
But that claim was disputed by a wide range of drug policy experts , and some politicians are questioning the drug wars results as well as its assumptions .
....
" If we were to evaluate Plan Colombia by its initial overriding criteria , the results of the drug war have been dubious at best , " said Russell Crandall , a former adviser to the White House and the author of  Driven by Drugs ,  a book on the drug war in the Andes .
" We can switch metaphors  saying it is first and 10 , second and 4 , light at the end of the tunnel  but whats left are often discouraging results on reducing the amount of drugs and cocaine in the United States , " he added .

WASHINGTON , Oct. 12 - Straining to meet President Bush 's mid-October deadline to clear out shelters , the federal government has moved hundreds of thousands of evacuees from Hurricane Katrina into hotel rooms at a cost of about $ 11 million a night , a strategy local officials and some members of Congress criticize as incoherent and wasteful .
The number of people in hotels has grown by 60 percent in the past two weeks as some shelters closed , reaching nearly 600,000 as of Tuesday .
Even so , relief officials say they cannot meet the deadline , as more than 22,000 people were still in shelters in 14 states on Wednesday .
The reliance on hotels has been necessary , housing advocates say , because the Federal Emergency and Management Agency has had problems installing mobile homes and travel trailers for evacuees and has been slow to place victims in apartments that real estate executives say are available throughout the southeast .
Hotel costs are expected to grow to as much as $ 425 million by Oct. 24 , a large expense never anticipated by the FEMA , which is footing the bill .
While the agency cannot say how that number will affect overall spending for storm relief , critics point out that hotel rooms , at an average cost of $ 59 a night , are significantly more expensive than apartments and are not suitable for months - long stays .
" I was completely astonished by the beauty of nature , " he said , laying a slightly gnarled finger alongside his nose , his longish white hair swept back from his temples and the crown of his head .
He said any natural scientist who was not a mystic was not a real natural scientist .
" Outside is pure energy and colorless substance , " he said .
" All of the rest happens through the mechanism of our senses .
Our eyes see just a small fraction of the light in the world .
It is a trick to make a colored world , which does not exist outside of human beings . "
He became particularly fascinated by the mechanisms through which plants turn sunlight into the building blocks for our own bodies .
" Everything comes from the sun via the plant kingdom , " he said .
MR. HOFMANN studied chemistry and took a job with the Swiss pharmaceutical company Sandoz Laboratories , because it had started a program to identify and synthesize the active compounds of medically important plants .
He soon began work on the poisonous ergot fungus that grows in grains of rye .
Midwives had used it for centuries to precipitate childbirths , but chemists had never succeeded in isolating the chemical that produced the pharmacological effect .
Finally , chemists in the United States identified the active component as lysergic acid , and Mr. Hofmann began combining other molecules with the unstable chemical in search of pharmacologically useful compounds .
His work on ergot produced several important drugs , including a compound still in use to prevent hemorrhaging after childbirth .
But it was the 25th compound that he synthesized , lysergic acid diethylamide , that was to have the greatest impact .
When he first created it in 1938 , the drug yielded no significant pharmacological results .
But when his work on ergot was completed , he decided to go back to LSD - 25 , hoping that improved tests could detect the stimulating effect on the body 's circulatory system that he had expected from it .
It was as he was synthesizing the drug on a Friday afternoon in April 1943 that he first experienced the altered state of consciousness for which it became famous .
" Immediately , I recognized it as the same experience I had had as a child , " he said .
" I did n't know what caused it , but I knew that it was important . "
When he returned to his lab the next Monday , he tried to identify the source of his experience , believing first that it had come from the fumes of a chloroform - like solvent he had been using .
Inhaling the fumes produced no effect , though , and he realized he must have somehow ingested a trace of LSD .
" LSD spoke to me , " Mr. Hofmann said with an amused , animated smile .
" He came to me and said , ' You must find me . '
He told me , ' Do n't give me to the pharmacologist , he wo n't find anything . ' "

The traditional face of protest : Activists on John Prescott 's roof
Stop Climate Chaos brings traditional environmental groups such as Greenpeace together with Christian development agencies like Christian Aid .
It is asking the government to cut Britain 's greenhouse gas emissions , and to ensure that overseas aid money is invested in clean technologies .
The group plans to expand its reach to include faiths other than Christianity .
Christians should be involved with the whole of God 's creation
Andy Atkins , Tearfund
" It brings together voices from across the development and environmental sectors to ask for definitive action on climate change . "
Its key demands are :
the UK government must deliver substantial annual reductions in UK greenhouse gas emissions , meet its target of cutting CO2 emissions by 20 % by 2010 and commit to an EU - wide greenhouse gas reduction target of 30 % by 2020
the UK government must make climate change a top international priority so that global warming is capped at a temperature rise of 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels .
This will require global emissions to have peaked and be irreversibly declining by 2015
the government must ensure that its policies on combating global poverty include investing in low - carbon technologies and clean energy and providing significantly more assistance to the developing world to adapt to climate change
Moral imperative
Climate change will have massive impacts on the poor ; that 's a moral issue
Ashok Sinha , Stop Climate Chaos
" As a development organisation , we can't ignore climate change , " said Tearfund 's advocacy director , Andy Atkins .
" But in addition , as a Christian organisation , Tearfund has in its operating principles that Christians should be involved with the whole of God 's creation , not just people .
" We have a good biblical mandate to be involved in climate change . "
The idea that Christians have a duty to campaign on climate change is already well established in the US , where organisations such as the National Association of Evangelicals ( NAE ) lobby on Capitol Hill and in their networks of churches across the country .
" We are creation care advocates , " said NAE 's vice - president for governmental affairs , Richard Cizik , " and it comes straight from scripture , straight from God , who in his words said in Genesis , for example , that we are stewards of what he has created ; we are to watch over and care for it .
" And the mere fact that evangelical Christians , who compose 40 % of the Republican party 's base , are beginning to say that this is an important issue , believe me has got the attention of people in the White House . "
Prayers for the planet
In the UK , the Church of Scotland has taken a lead in the field though its Society , Religion and Technology Project , which has produced a special liturgy on climate change , and took part in a silent protest outside July 's G8 summit in Gleneagles , where leaders concluded a climate agreement which has been widely derided by environmental groups .
Climate change may bring floods to poor countries like Bangladesh
Generally , though , religious groups in Britain have confined themselves to pointing up the problem and urging individuals to change lifestyle , through initiatives such as Operation Noah and Eco-congregation , rather than stepping into the hurly - burly roughhouse of political lobbying .
Ashok Sinha believes the decision of religious organisations to sign up to Stop Climate Chaos is an indication that things are changing .
" What it demonstrates is that this is a cross-cutting issue of our time ; it 's not just an environmental issue , " he said .
" It will have massive impacts , including on the world 's poor .
That 's a moral question , so it 's not surprising that religious organisations will want to be involved . "
Broad church
The initial line - up of Stop Climate Chaos includes no organisations linked to faiths other than Christianity , but that may change .
Tony Blair : Applause for views , opprobrium for rising UK emissions
" It 's early days , and we hope that they will get involved . "
Potentially , the involvement of faith groups will give Stop Climate Chaos a new route into 10 Downing Street , where resides one of the most overtly Christian British prime ministers of modern times .
" We 're certainly keen to discuss with Mr Blair how it affects his thinking on climate change , " said Andy Atkins .
" We 're not sure whether it will give us any extra access ; but he is already convinced , we think , of the need to do something , although actions and policies have n't gone as far as we would want him to go . "

Each gold particle is just 16 billionths of a metre across
UK researchers are employing tiny gold " nanoparticles " , 1/5000th the thickness of a human hair , to deliver the chemical compound directly into cancer cells , tearing them apart instantly .
The common dye found in blue jeans and ballpoint pens is called phthalocyanine and is a light - activated , or photosensitive , agent with cell - destroying properties .
This has been known for at least 15 years but , until now , scientists have not been able to successfully deliver it into cells ; hence there 's no harm in wearing blue jeans .
The University of East Anglia ( UEA ) team used the gold particles as " trojan horses " .
Their small size enables them to easily enter cells , and the phthalocyanine is taken up along with them .
When pulsed with laser light , the compound produces a highly reactive form of oxygen which causes the cancer cells to commit suicide .
Cancer cells are too greedy for their own good
Dr David Russell
" We have shown using nanotechnology that we can get phthalocyanine into the cancer cells where it binds and , on activation , causes substantial cell death , " he told the British Association 's Science Festival .
Red ' trigger '
Healthy cells will also internalise the drug - coated nanoparticles , but unlike cancer cells they will excrete the phthalocyanine .
" Cancer cells are too greedy for their own good , " said Dr Russell .
" They are growing so fast that they take in and retain everything - not just nutrients needed for growth . "
Nanoparticles guide the dye into cancer cells
Of these all are water soluble and are used largely to treat skin cancer as they naturally accumulate in the surface of the skin where they are more easily activated by light .
For some reason , phthalocyanine does not get into the skin - making it more suitable for treating solid tumours within the body .
" Best of all , " added Dr Russell , " this compound is optimised for activation by red light and produces far more of the deadly oxygen than the currently available photodynamic therapies .
" In addition , because it does n't go into the skin there is no need for the patient to stay out of the sun which can trigger side - effects with the other drugs . "
No escape
Traditional cancer chemotherapies rely on the patient being able to process the drug .
In some people , their genetic differences mean this does not happen and for others , their cells become resistant to the effects of the drug .
Photodynamic therapy bypasses this issue because it does not rely on the body to activate the drug - rather a pulse of , rather ordinary , red light .
Dr Mark Wainwright , a senior lecturer in medicinal chemistry at the Liverpool John Moores University says that an improved drug design such as this should have significant advantages over the currently available photosensitive agents .
He adds : " Red light can only travel through 5 - 6 mm tissue , but activating the nanoparticles in tumours inside the body , such as in the gut , could be done by using a fibre optic cable to shine the laser on the cancer target . "
So far , Dr Russell 's research , recently published in Photochemical and Photobiological Sciences , has only been conducted on human cervical cells in the laboratory .
But his team 's collaborators in Italy have just begun testing the approach in animal models of cancer .
If all goes to plan , phthalocyanine nanoparticles could be available for human trials within five years and will be administered either by injection into the bloodstream or directly into a tumour .
Rick Strahl ( ASP.NET MVP ) has a great article called Past the AJAX Hype – Some things to think about .
It ’s about the applicability of AJAX in web - based business applications .
“ AJAX is hot and people are falling all over themselves to be associated with this technology .
As happens so often in this field , some new technological feature ( in this case not even new ) gets hyped way out of proportion and the press goes wild .
Oh and the trendy developers and IT guys go right along . ”
Yep .
And the big “ AJAX Manifesto ” if you will was written by , a user experience company !
Even Jesse James Garrett , who penned the AJAX term , says :
“ If anything about current interaction design can be called “ glamorous , ” it ’s creating Web applications . ”
But how , especially if you ’re building business applications , do you use AJAX effectively ?
Rick points to a contest Tim Haines started that basically asks what part AJAX should play in business applications ( the example is an online store , which Rick also sells one of , but it ’s applicability to corporate developers is also interesting ) .
One problem is that AJAX might not be considered “ primary technology ” yet :
“ There are too many old browsers out there for one thing .
XmlHttp is relatively new for Mozilla style browsers and Opera is just now getting it .
Older browsers are going to be left out .
In addition , AJAX of course relies on JavaScript and if that ’s turned off you are also locked out .
In IE the XmlHttp object is an ActiveX object which is probably more serious because many IT departments lock out ActiveX usage on browsers completely . ”
Another issue , not a problem , is what does AJAX really add ?
Most people say “ to avoid postbacks . ”
Like Rick , I think that :
“ POST back speed is not a huge issue .
But then I try to use old school efficiency in my apps and not do everything the Asp.NET brute force way which often results in humongous pages with ViewState out of control .
Yup – believe it or not , but using traditional Web application development constructs like plain links , non-ViewStated grids actually result in better responding applications than all the crap ASP.
NET often piles on by default . ”
So a properly constructed web application has less use for AJAX than maybe most people currently believe .
There are some good reasons to use the technology , but much AJAX now is just “ hey look what I can do ” not what I should do to help the user .
Data validation is a good example .
Validating a zip code corresponds to the state entered would be a nice touch , especially if you can get a response back to the user that they accidentally typed in the wrong number .
But these are small things which , although nice , do n’t merit the revolutionary hype we ’re seeing .
Rick also writes a pretty good argument against trying to recreate a rich - client application in the browser .

A " Jenny " biplane over Ontario , Canada , c. 1918
Today , the term ‘ flying circus ’ most often brings to mind dead parrots , cheese shops , and the Knights Who Say ‘ Ni ’.
Before the Python guys came along , however , there was a different sort of flying circus – quite a literal one – in the U.S. and Canada in the early days of aviation .
After the First World War , the American government found itself with a large surplus of Curtiss JN - 4 biplanes ( known as ‘ Jennys ’ ) .
Flying was not yet regulated by laws and licenses , and so the planes were simply sold to anyone who wanted them .
The Jennys were known to go for as little as $ 200 , which , although a lot more money in those days , was a fraction of the original $ 5,000 production cost .
Many of the buyers were former pilots in the war who wanted to keep flying , but quite a few of the others who purchased planes had never actually flown before .
In fact , this would be the first major form of civil aviation .
Quickly , this new influx of planes among civilians lent itself to entertainment .
Airspace was open to any plane at this stage , and so at first pilots simply made money by going from town to town and offering ten - minute rides to the locals .
This worked for a while , until planes became widespread enough for basic flight to become largely unremarkable .
At this point , people began to do flashier things in the air – namely , all sorts of creative and crazy stunts right on top of the wings of the planes .
It is not clear how the term ‘ barnstorming ’ emerged .
One theory holds that it was named for earlier groups of travelling actors who had put on plays in barns .
Another , more plausible , argues that it was based on the usual way in which the shows were announced to the local townspeople .
Pilots would fly over a town to make themselves noticed , and then land at a nearby farm and ask the farmer for the temporary use of the fields as a runway .
Then , often the planes were met by rural towns with tremendous excitement in anticipation of the show .
The phenomenon was a team effort throughout ; the barnstormers consisted of both pilots and stuntpeople .
They followed the example of brief flying exhibitions put on by the Wright brothers and Glen Curtiss in the first decade of the 20th century , but took it much further .
Aerialists performed ‘ wing - walking ’ , sometimes in costume .
They transferred planes in mid-air , often via a small , secured post in the centre of the wing .
And it got more elaborate than that .
Barnstormer Al Wilson shot golf balls .
Mabel Cody danced .
Gladys
Ingle shot arrows at a target ( although did n’t necessarily hit it ) .
Ivan Unger and Gladys Roy played tennis – complete with a tiny net stretched across the wing directly above the cockpit .
Jack Shack hung from a trapeze – by his teeth .
Eddie Angel did what was effectively a free - fall , for thousands of feet , holding a pair of flashlights .
As in most modern airshows , sometimes the impressive aspect of the stunts came from the pilots .
Occasionally , for example , objects were passed from a person on the ground to one hanging from a plane – undoubtedly a delicate maneuver .
Other times it was the sheer endurance displayed that was the impressive aspect of the show ; Pilot “ Speed ” Holman once flew 1,093 consecutive loops .
One notable aspect of barnstorming was that , in spite of its time , a substantial number of women and African - Americans took part .
This was partially due to the tendency for larger groups ( including some families ) to work together for a barnstorming show .
These performances , which were eventually labelled ‘ flying circuses ’ , usually involved several planes and many stuntpeople .
They were better - organized than the smaller teams , and even notified towns ahead of time to schedule their shows .
Probably the most well - travelled was the Ivan Gates Flying Circus , which went to every state that existed at the time , as well as to several international locations .
Often barnstorming was quite lucrative , in part because it still offered rides to civilians .
It was notable also for its role in training pilots ; historian Don Dwiggins points out the widespread belief that , during the height of barnstorming ’s popularity , the Gates Flying Circus trained more than the Army and Navy put together .
The notorious Charles Lindbergh was among the pilots who started out in barnstorming .
A wingwalker
Barnstorming had its problems , though .
For one thing , it was difficult in the early days of flight to be on such long trips .
Pilots risked running out of fuel or spare parts , and it was exhausting for everyone involved .
The stuntpeople sometimes even had to sleep on the wing of the plane .
Obviously , it was also a dangerous pursuit .
As barnstorming ’s popularity grew , the performances became increasingly elaborate and risky .
In 1924 , stuntperson Rosalie Gordon ’s parachute was tangled in the landing gear of a plane ; she was rescued by fellow barnstormer Clyde “ Upside - Down ” Pangborn from the Gates Flying Circus .
Most barnstorming accidents , however , ended less happily .
Although it is unclear just how many barnstormers were killed or injured while performing , the negative publicity started to dampen the huge appeal that barnstorming had had .
It might still have continued for a while , however , if it had n’t been for two things the American government did in the later half of the decade .
First , it stopped selling Jennys to the public ; the existing ones were in decay , and there was no other inexpensive source of aircraft that could keep barnstorming as common as it had been .
Second , in 1927 major new restrictions on the uses of aircraft and airspace were put into effect .
While they did n’t make barnstorming per se illegal , so many of the tricks were outlawed that barnstorming lost nearly all of its appeal .
After this , the phenomenon died out almost overnight .
A few barnstormers continued performing through the century – perhaps most notably extreme free - faller Joseph Kittinger – but barnstorming clearly could never see the popularity it once had .
It was featured in a couple of films and one 1982 Atari video game , but little else .
These days , some people use the term ‘ barnstorming ’ as a synonym for mere ‘ stunt flying ’ , and the only popular flying circus afterwards was Monty Python ’s , which kept its foot on the ground ( if only in a literal sense ) .
But barnstorming certainly has its place in history , and in entertainment .
Among other things , it serves as a stark reminder that extreme sports were around long before the 1980s and 90s .
Mike Wilkerson posted a commendably frank article about " hot tar " on his GTD superhighway .
I congratulate him on his honesty and willingness to share what I think a lot of us face daily - the more we do , the more we leave undone .
Looking back on past times in my career ( verb - to veer erratically in an uncontrolled fashion ) I can hardly understand how I made some tasks fill the time that they did .
But better organisation and focus seem to have come at the price of higher expectations and an increasingly feeble grip on how long things will actually take to do .
Predicting how much can be done in a day , a week or a month is more political than scientific , and we repeatedly sell things to ourselves in the same way and for the same reasons that a project manager sells dreams to senior management .
The inescapable practical details that Mike describes are the leaden boots that turn the vision of a sprint into the reality of crawling on all fours .
It 's easy to indulge in thinking that you are under - performing and everyone else is doing better .
Systems like GTD ( or Covey , or RPM , or many more ) offer the promise of a change to a higher level of accomplishment through a systematic approach .
Without any doubt , there are people who use these systems who are very successful .
But whether they are successful because of their system is debatable .
If anything , it seems probable to me that successful people are attracted to systems that reflect their preferences , and begin the race from a different starting point .
For the rest of us , lasting benefit only occurs if we can actually do the one thing that is alien , distasteful and nigh - on impossible - change our habits , and change as a person .
For most people , habits that constrain performance are a comfortable framework that we love to hate and cannot tear ourselves away from .
By adopting habits that have a predictable outcome , we have exercised a choice , and we prefer predictability over uncertainty .
Even if we continually say we want to change and will change , only one or two members of the committee in our heads is actually convinced , and the silent majority still exercise their veto .
This is perhaps the reason that changes in habit and approach arise from life - changing traumas and events - it takes something of that magnitude to actually enforce a change .
Since adopting GTD , I have learned to live with a to - do list that could keep me occupied for the next two to five years .
I luxuriate in thinking that this is a bad thing and that I am failing to make significant progress each week , but in reality it 's not like that .
By taking action , I am taking decisions - deciding to do one task in a hundred and leave the other 99 unattended .
Instead of beating myself up for failing to also complete the other 99 actions , I can tell myself that I chose not to do them .
If they were truly important , I would have done them .
Actions speak louder than words .
The existence of the list gives you a baseline to evaluate whether it was better to do that one thing than to not do 99 others .
Without the list as an anchor , you will just go wherever the wind takes you .

The scientists ´ scheme for detecting macroscopic entanglement : two laser pulses reflect off two identical oscillators , exciting a vibrational mode which generates optical sideband modes .
After a beam splitter mixes the " Stokes " modes ( red ) , detectors perform measurements which turn the optomechanical entanglement into mechanical entanglement .
Credit : Stefano Pirandola , et al .
Building upon recent studies on optomechanical entanglement with lasers and mirrors , a group of scientists has developed a theoretical model using entanglement swapping in order to entangle two micromechanical oscillators .
This ability could lead to advances in information processing , as well as other applications that use micromechanical resonators , such as electrometers , displacement detectors , and radio frequency signal processors , wrote scientists Stefano Pirandola et al. in a recent Physical Review Letters .
" Until now , entanglement has been observed only for optical modes , i.e. , photons ( which are massless particles ) , " Pirandola told PhysOrg.com .
" The significance of purely mechanical entanglement would be that it involves massive objects like mechanical oscillators ( small vibrations on a mirror ) .
Even though the oscillators must be small -- their mass should be on the order of micrograms and their length around the micrometer -- these sizes are ' macroscopic ' for a quantum mechanical object . "
The two entangled oscillators in Pirandola et al 's proposed model are the mechanical components of two separate micro-opto - mechanical systems .
Instead of entangling the oscillators directly , the scientists suggested entangling the optical parts of the systems -- the reflected laser beams -- and then used entanglement swapping to correlate the two oscillators .
In entanglement swapping , two objects that have correlated properties never meet directly ; instead , a third party acts as a messenger between the two , swapping their properties as accurately as if they had directly interacted .
One potential use for entanglement swapping is in quantum repeaters for future quantum computers , which would amp up the signal over long distances to prevent it from being buried by noise and dying out .
Earlier studies on optomechanical entanglement ( extensively performed by the Univ. of Camerino group ) demonstrated that radiation pressure from an intense laser beam shining on an oscillator could excite the oscillator 's vibrational mode and yield two optical sideband modes induced by the vibrations .
In the current scheme , when the two oscillators are positioned in such a way that their generated optical modes meet after reflecting , the beams could be mixed with a beam splitter .
Next , a " middleman " detection device would detect and mix the optical modes , and also perform measurements such as joined Homodyne detections , which are standard optical measurements for detecting radiation .
When the detector performs these measurements , it can pass on the outcomes of the measurements to both the oscillators .
Through this swapping , the entanglement changes from optomechanical to purely mechanical .
In addition to opening the doors to future applications , mechanical macroscopic entanglement would also demonstrate that mechanical systems made of atoms can exhibit quantum behaviour .
Pirandola et al 's calculations for quantum entanglement on a macroscopic scale , in a purely mechanical state , suggest that quantum phenomenon may not be as limited to the quantum world as scientists once thought .
" Would this theoretical scheme diminish the differences between the macroscopic and quantum worlds ?
This is a fundamental question of quantum mechanics , " said Pirandola .
" Whether or not there is a maximum size for oscillators that demonstrate entanglement is an open question right now .
We do n't know if there is some limit for the sizes of the objects to be entangled .
Optimists think that it is only a matter of advances in quantum technologies . "

Scars

In general , I think entrepreneurs and VCs who lived through the last bubble and its burst are better off because of it .
We ’ve seen what can go wrong and what happens when it does go wrong .
I think it has made us all better at what we do .
But there are some scars that may not be all healthy .
For example , in 1999 we stepped on the gas and made something like 20 investments at Flatiron .
Many of them worked out well and we booked a bunch of profits in 1999 and 2000 from those deals .
Of course a good number of the 1999 investments we did n’t get out of before the bubble burst went bust or went through painful recaps which are actually now paying huge dividends .
Fast forward to 2006 and Union Square Ventures is going to make maybe 5 investments this year .
We made 4 last year .
We are taking a cautious measured approach to our investment pace .
That was one of the lessons we learned from the last bubble .
Stepping on the gas before the crash is a good way to get hurt .
But there are VCs who are stepping on the gas right now and are getting rewarded for it .
Are we being too cautious because of the scars we carry on our back from the last bubble ?
It ’s impossible to know .
But hindsight will tell us the answer in a few years .
I was in a board meeting recently and the founder , who ran a different company during the bubble , was talking about his team .
He said the team was getting a bit uneasy about all the new hires that the company is making .
It reminds them of the time they bulked up in the last bubble .
And that bulking up caused a lot of pain when the market broke .
Pattern recognition is human nature .
When you ’ve seen the movie before , you know how it ends .
And so all of us who carry the scars from the last bubble are going to think twice before we make the same moves again .
But what if the same moves we made last time are the right moves to make this time ?
Then we are going to sub-optimize this current market opportunity .
We are going to be too defensive .
And someone else is going to step on the gas and pass us at the next turn .
It ’s a challenge that we have to face .
We cannot forget the lessons from that last bubble .
But we can not fight the last war either .
As much as things look similar to the last time , they are not identical .
This will play out differently .
I am not sure how differently but I know that it wo n’t be the same .
So carrying those scars is both good and bad .
Probably more good than bad , but not all good either .
And it ’s important to recognize that .

He also wears his socks inside - out , and will flip the fuck out and walk strangely if he is forced to wear them properly , because it drives him crazy .
All of his socks must be laundered right side in and then turned inside out before they are returned to him .
He gave specific instructions about handling his food , and not allowing his vegetables to touch any other food item on the plate .
His utensils must be steamed over boiling water .
He will not eat soup which has n't been boiled within the past 20 minutes or which he has not prepared himself .
If any of these rules are violated , he flies into a rage , turns beet red , and will not eat a single thing .
He has his personal attendants confirm over and over that the food is as he likes it .
He also shaves his forearms and hands because he can't stand the idea of body hair on his arms .
He demands that his bedsheets are bleach white and changed fresh every night and he sleeps in a separate bed in a big , tight , body - length nylon sleeve , with a fan blowing over him at full power .
He is terrified of animals which have fur or hair longer than one inch , and will not go near curly hair of any kind , even on people .
At one time he ran from his office and demanded that someone look under everything for a rodent which did not and could not exist , then he had the entire place wiped down with disinfectant and vacuumed twice .
While this was done he could n't even bear to look at the door , or come within 20 feet of his office .
He was in hysterics .
President Bush , when dining at the white - house , does not eat any item of food which has not been first sniffed by a trained dog before being prepared .
Think about that .
Word among the staff is that Cheney was drunk when he shot that lawyer , and secluded himself for a day to sober up and avoid felony firearms charges .
I do n't have any direct information on this because the guys with him at the time are not talking .
This is totally unconfirmed , but I think it is plausible .
Dick Cheney has chronic gum problems and his breath smells like shit as a result .
He is also a CLOSE TALKER .
He keeps a small bottle of diluted hydrogen peroxide which he rinses with every hour on the hour , and he swallows it instead of spitting .
He also picks his nose vigorously ( violently ) and hums loudly and tunelessly to himself while taking shits .
There is a sealed room in the whitehouse which once held a half - ton block of cheese for about 30 years .
The White house is planting its own men among the press agents at press conferences .
The white house lawn is mowed every other day by the same man humming the same tune .
Despite all of this craziness , there is nothing strange whatsoever about Condoleeza Rice .
She is completely balanced and normal , if slightly robotic in her personal demeanor .
She smells very nice at all times .
She does , however , constantly check her investments online from her office when she thinks that nobody is looking , and she has slept at her desk on multiple occasions .
There is an administrative law judge who sits in an office in a building near the white - house , earns around 200 k per year and has a secretary , and he does nothing except sit , read , and listen to classical music all day .
His secretary likewise does nothing .
He gets meals taken to him from the White - house kitchen , and is so lonely that he latches on to whoever gets sent and talks to them for hours about the korean war .
His family is all dead and his secretary hates him .
In a drawer in his desk he has an old revolver , which he got in there somehow despite that he should n't have been able to bring it in .
I think he will shoot himself one day .
The " undisclosed location " is usually a local police officer training ground or state trooper college .
Shh .

Despite the popular conception , I have never , ever , ever seen President Bush give anyone around him a nickname when it was n't for public effect to make him seem home - towney .
He also has a thing where his accent gets more pronounced when there is a camera on him .
Go figure .

Me and my friends joked about him having to be wasted but I did n't know it could be true .
Because of some kind of medical condition , he gets incredibly hammered on very tiny amounts of alcohol .
However , he also loves the taste of hard liquor .
He has a little spit glass that he uses to taste whiskey in his office .
Between the hydrogen and the whiskey , he is a fucking loathsome man to have proximate .

I do n't know if Tom Ridge really is that OCD , but I believe every word about Cheney .
For some reason it did n't surprise me at all .
Tom Ridge brushes his teeth like 3 times per day religiously , but he can't stand looking at someone brushing their teeth .
He contorts as in agony , as if he is actually experiencing pain .
He can't watch himself brush his teeth , and even describing the process of brushing teeth drives him up a wall .
If you joke around near Rumsfeld , he will stare at you intensely as if you just killed his mother for about 10 seconds , which will be unnerving because you think you 've offended him , then he will begin to laugh a little bit , a bit more , until he is in hysterics .
He has a chest condition called Pleurisy that causes this ; breathing deeply is painful to him as is laughing with gusto , so he tries very hard to control himself before losing it .
It really unnerves people who are trying to be sociable .
This is the reason for his creepy shallow laugh in public .

How can I get a 200k / yr job with the Feds where I just sit on my ass ?
How much would it cost me ?
Be a war hero and also good friends with Ronald Regean while he was president , and also specialize in an area of law which is heavily federally regulated .
Become an administrative law judge , then make sure the industry for the specific appeals board you sit on has suddenly done a great job of self - regulating so nothing ever makes it to you .
Stroke your old revolver and have sad , sad lonely eyes .
The man is possibly the most sad , forgotten , wretched creature I have ever met , yet somehow I feel a deep well of sympathy for him .
He was once incredibly relevant , now he simply sits and does nothing in the hopes that he will never be noticed ever again .
As for condi sleeping in her office , I 'm almost convinced she has narcolepsy .
She 'll work like crazy , and then BAM she 's asleep on her desk for 15 minutes in the middle of the day , utterly insensible to anything , before suddenly jerking back up and animating as if driven by hidden clockwork gears .

You have to tell us more about that giant block of cheese .
What the fuck where they thinking ?
Why was it removed ?
Did you ever eat any of it ?
This is actually the least believable anecdote , but it is recorded historical fact , and I encourage anyone who is interested to research it and discover its truth for themselves .
Back in the very beginning , on an anniversary of the states were joining the union , they 'd send gifts .
Philledelphia or Vermont , or one of those states , gave a gigantic , wagon - sized wheel of cheese .
It was kept in a room and whenever there was a social event , they 'd run in there , cut off the disgusting rancid mold , and start serving the still - good undercheese .
After they had mined the thing and pockmarked it enough that cutting off the rancid portions was really difficult , they wheeled it out and rolled it down a hill into the river .
The room has been remodelled several times but still people complain about the odor , so it is seldom used , not even for storage .
I personally can't smell anything in there , so I think a lot of it is just a placebo effect .

It is a little unfair to be picking on these people because they 're all old men , and their bodies are falling apart , but oh well .
Rumsfeld lets out really disgusting , wet farts , and then unbelievably denies the act .
All staff on hand knows he does it , but nobody calls him on it , because he is Donald Rumsfeld .
If he is really concentrating , he also reads letters and reports people write to him out loud in a weird squeaky voice .
It sounds like some kind of crazy dramatic reading for a very very boring play .
The strangest thing about Wolfowitz was that he kept 4 pair of identical shoes in his office that he never , ever wore .
He had some personal pictures on his shelf that he would violently snap down if he was in a bad mood , especially while on the phone .
Also he is a frequent bathroom - user , but given the age of the men involved here , just assume that they all excuse themselves to piss all the goddamn time .
Also , another quirk about Cheney 's hydrogen peroxide habit .
He basically whips out a hip flask and takes a mouthful , and rinces for about two minutes , then swallows .
Then , without fail , he tells everyone around him that he is using hydrogen peroxide , that it is great for your teeth , and that they too should rinse with it as he does .
I think he 's worried people will misunderstand what he is doing and think he 's a lush .
Edit :
Now that I 'm talking about Rumsfeld 's legendary farts , I realize that I 'm pretty much tapped out .
I do n't have anything interesting left to say which would n't expose me .
Thanks for letting me get this off my chest .

I have a hard time believing that someone of your strange , excellent caliber could find a job in the White House , MR .
Here 's how the WH is populated .
The secret service and other support staff are all exceedingly normal , competent , and excellent .
They have families and careers and what - not .
The people they 're supporting come in two breeds : Ultra - competent semi-robotic A+ Harvard individuals with no personal life like Condi , or C - Harvard super - connected but barely contained balls of psychotic neurosis like Tom Ridge .
It is as if these people spend so much of their mental energy trying to be normal , that all the strangenes manifests in their personal lives in a magnified and spectacular fashion .
Both are necessary to form an administration ; the robots can't win a campaign and the psychotic schmoozers can't run things .
Of course , people like Tom Ridge can only exist in a super - insulated environment or be destroyed by news of his eccentricities .
One news story about the head of homeland security rolling around in his office , screaming about rats and attacking his own legs with an Iowa paperweight , if believed , will end a career .
Chertoff is a robot and is not as entertaining .

Because it is based upon a naive and incorrect conception of how Washington functions these days , that the crime , if reported , would actually be corrected .
The box car thing is one of a stupendous number of sham operations going on right now in the Federal government .
I 've thought about doing what he 's suggested , but it wo n't do any good in the end .
The entire system will perpetuate itself until a cataclysm of public opinion sweeps through the country .
The other , not as obvious sham is the following , which happens every single day here .
A lobbyist will say that their startup company 's new weapons system can fly from a plane and hit any target within 3 inches , regardless of weather conditions , by the way , wink wink , we are ( or are owned by , or know ) a major campaign donor .
Of course , the weapons system does n't perform as advertised , or perhaps fails in the design stages , or maybe never even gets researched , and this is just a sham to get contributions .

At the risk of summoning some sort of D&D nuclear assault , what is the attitude towards peak oil around the White House ?
Does anybody know or care ?
It 's a combination of not knowing and not caring .
It 's filed in our collective consciousness as a potential political bone , but not as an actual problem which needs discussing or solving .
In a way , nobody cares whether it is true or false .
Like everything else , we only care about its potential to affect the administration or its tactical value in a campaign .
If it becomes important , we 'll all act like it is true or false , depending upon our particular strategy , determined by a combination of public sentiment and how much money comes from which people .
If it pleases enough people and is possible , the issue will be addressed indirectly in a way which satisfies both money and sentiment .
This is why there is a lot of smoke about green energy technology , because it makes peak oil crazies happy and re-assures our supporting interests that we are n't taking any negative action .
Edit :
And I say " peak oil crazies " not because they are crazy for believing in peak oil , but because they are crazy about it at this particular time .

Is there a " gallows humor " amongst the higher ups ?
I always thought being a politician who has to comment on things like bombings , genocides , assassinations and the like would end up having pretty dark senses of humor .
Are there any references to popular myths floating around as well ?
( " Hey Random shape up or we 'll do ya like we did JFK chick chick " )
New comers and low - midlevel people have this kind of thing going on , but , like forums catchphrases , these things are not done by people who Matter .
It 's a LOT like forums catchphrases .
People who make these jokes are obviously new blood , to whom their positioning is a novel and thus joke - worthy circumstance .
It marks them as new , inexperienced , and unconnected , so they learn to shut the fuck up .
Either that or they are retarded , like most FBI I 've ever met .
The FBI is full of the stupidest , most moronic rejects from society , and they only ever get anything done because they 're so massive .
They 're either idiot aggrandized cops or corrupt political appointees , or they 're ancient and awesome .
The latter is a dying breed .
Most of the goons hanging around the white house in various staff positions try to be funny , but are too indoctrinated , stupid , or submerged in their particular brand of administrative culture to make jokes which are sensible to me .
As for gallows humor like joking horribly about the current political snap , it depends on the man .
Rumsfeld will crack jokes about electrodes and testicals , and exclaim about horrendous things , but this is mostly because he does a lot of contemplation outloud in his loud , squeaky , unnerving thinking - voice , and he contemplates a lot of horrendous things .
He does n't joke with people much because it hurts him to laugh .
Wolfowitz makes no jokes that I have seen , the closest he has gone is subtle , straight faced statements of irony at which he does not laugh .
He kind of smiles very slightly and has a quizzical expression after issuing these statements , which is the only hint that he 's trying to be funny .
Cheney , I think , has some kind of reptile brain that operates on a level of humor which is so basic and ponderous that sometimes his jokes sound like regular ( or particularly stupid ) comments , and slip under everyone 's radar .
There are certain types of humor that takes several levels of comprehension to understand ;
Cheney has not expressed any facility in this .
His gags are base humor , and usually made at incredibly inappropriate times too , like making a finger fucking gesture when he really should NOT be making a finger fucking gesture .
Cheney 's jokes are like your father or mother , who is not funny or with it , trying to make a joke .

Everyone here is loathsome in one way or another .
Even people who are squeaky clean become loathsome for that reason , because anyone here who is squeaky clean is only so by virtue of a psyche too insane or disconnected from reality for smut to stick .
True cleanliness is squeezed out or quashed before it can take root .
In order to embed within the system here in Washington , you have to have a duplicitous corruption of spirit , and the ability to , deep down , deceive yourself into believing that lies are truth , and to have utter conviction about it .
For this reason many of the people here are n't alltogether human , in my eyes .
People around here who are disconnected from the machine are still decent .
Thus , there is nobody here I truly like except for the extreme low - level support staff like the cooks and maids , and collateral administrative officials like that isolated wretch of a Judge I mentioned .
Some people in independent administrative agencies are great , because they are independent , non-partisan , and usually more passionate about their work than they are about the position .

What 's the general take on the religious right inside the White House ?
Is it one of those things where it 's worked in the past and these people vote so lets throw some smoke up their asses and keep them voting .
Or is there genuine support and care for the interests of this particular voting block ?
Also , is Bush a religious man ?
You have to separate the people that constitute the Religious Right from the Religious Right itself , which is an interest .
Asking whether a politician genuinely supports or cares about an interest is like asking whether a stockbroker supports and cares for Coca Cola .
There has to be professional detachment .
It depends on the market , and if he actually cares and acts according to some sort of sentimental feeling about Coca Cola which is n't totally a function of market conditions , he 's a bad stock broker , cut from the herd , and eaten by bears .
There has to be an emotional separation .
" The Religious Right " is actually just a voting bloc , a collection of issues , influential people , and interested voters , so you can't care about it .
You use it , like a hammer or a microphone .
As for the people within the religious right ... well , it 's hard to tell even for an insider whether they actually give a shit about the people .
These individuals are the greatest in the nation at generating a phoney appearance of concern .
Sometimes they will make coarse , off - camera remarks about smelly old ladies or flood victims , but who knows if this indicates their true feelings over general frustration .

I do n't think Bush quite knows the answer to this himself .
If you asked him , he 'd say yes , as if he believes it , and I think he 's convinced himself of this .
However , he uses religion as a tool so much in dealing with just about everyone that anyone in his position , even the genuinely religious , would be confused about whether or not their faith is true .

Democracy as a government relies upon the ability of factions to compromise on divisive issues through rational debate instead of violence .
The current political power brokers have figured out how to short circuit this process by focusing national attention on issues which are based on differences of non-negotiable , irrational moral sentiment , and are thus not subject to resolution through rational reconciliation .
They 've broken democracy .

Higher - ups do strategic positioning of the administration and determine which is the most painless stance to take on any given issue .
Each stance has its benefits and drawbacks .
The strategic positioning is delivered down to him and his , and they figure out how to articulate it in such a way as to emphasize the benefits and spin or ignore the draw - backs .
The emphasis and spin is his department , the strategic positioning is above him .

The joke was that they did n't want people hanging themselves as there was some bad news coming down the pipeline , but it actually turned out to be some retarded fire - hazard thing .
I looked over some of the " documentary " and read some of the spin online about it .
The set up is very familiar , just like a lot of things I 've seen prepared ; cobble together a series of evidentiary documents and statements , proposals which sound sinister but which are actually just the everyday papertrail of this institution .
If a plan is possible , no matter how evil - sounding , it is written down , considered , and chucked or saved .
< Someone > could probably , if wanted to , find a document proposing the assassination of the president of france which is of no vintage later than 20 years old .
It means nothing , because many people here are busily trying to think outside the box in their action proposals , and the first thing most newbies think outside the box about is stuff beyond the pale like butchering babies or assassinating people .
It 's edgy !
Look at me !
Here 's my take on it .
The conspiracy it describes is too huge to stay secret .
I wo n't go forward with information about blenders in the desert , but I am not so depraved that I would stand by as civillians are killed for petty political reasons .
I 'd like to think that I am no different from anyone else around here in that regard .
The massive actions described in the documentary rely on a chain of human beings , and it would be extraordinary to find a chain of individuals so dedicated that they would not leak this info .
I do n't want to bother going through it and finding specific things to refute , but given the way I 've seen things operate around here , there is absolutely no way that this would go on and not be exposed within a matter of months .

Homeland security has been a compelete failure .
Homeland security started as a really awesome idea to revolutionize the huge structure of administrative agencies within a centralized cabinet .
It was really really awesome at the time and everyone was excited about it , even people like me who usually have nothing to do with this crap .
It got bogged down because there was a shortage of good talent to design and put into it at that given moment , and people who felt they were owed political favors would resent being passed over for positions .
The result is a horrible mess which is exacerbated by the fact that the resulting organizational structure was never refined or even properly DEfined .
Instead of a slick cock - like penisular totem pole of speed , you have a horrible turf - war of budgetary battles , ship - jumping , and intra-administration head - hunting .
There was a string board at the beginning , showing links between various organizational units , and when the Homeland Security was getting proposed , it looked like a thing of beauty .
Everyone was jazzed .
Then compromises happened and it turned into a horrible tangled mess , and just by looking at it on the board I could tell that no good would come from it .

I 'm sorry if these have been asked before , but have you ever met other world leaders such as Putin when they come over ?
Anything quirky about other nation 's leaders ?
World leaders are carefully insulated and exposed to an incredibly refined process designed to give them only what intelligence exposures we want them to have .
For this reason , I 've not had very many " chance " encounters with them , but I did , in fact , encounter Putin .
He had some extremely bizarre notions about our export policies , like to the point where I think he believed that our government actually controls which products we do and do not export to his country , and what quality those products are .
I 'm not sure if he was trying to make everyone uncomfortable or if he actually believed that the US Government goes through chicken bones and horseshoes or whatever the fuck they buy , chooses the shitty ones , and crates them up to go to Russia .
It caused me to be a little worried about what is going on in that country , but I try not to think about that stuff .

Oh yeah , I meant the other way around .
If Hillary runs , Condi will run .
Otherwise she will not run .
Hillary will not run , I think .
She has " taint . "
The first thing that will happen if she runs is that a lot of nutjob hatchetmen will come out of the woodwork , claiming that she sexually molested children , she takes prozac for breakfast , she had a secret operation to remove her facial hair in mexico , she took money from lobbiests , she threw her vietnam war medals over the gate of the white house , etc .
She 's tainted , so a lot of this stuff might stick , or it will leave enough residual slime that for some reason that most americans can't put their finger on , she seems sleazy , even if they can't figure out what particular thing she 's done .
It 's sinister and effective , because it takes advantage of the sloppy way our minds work .

Is there anything that you mention about opinions from the white house staff / admins on real world issues that are currently going on right now ?
Everything from Katrina to the middle east and terrorism ?
I like to steer away from really current stuff because people here might remember particular encounters they had with me when they are more recent .
To be frank , I have no idea how the fuck we dodged the Katrina bullet .
They have this thing where they assemble a lot of raw information and organize it , combine it with media coverate summaries , and then show it to various people here for an assessment , and we look guilty as fuck .
I can't even begin to explain how the media has not destroyed us utterly , and instead we are on just a nice , slow decline .

As in people in the administration , or people such as yourself ?
Jailings are pretty fucking random , but they can be somewhat predicted by who the first people to run to the investigatory committee or prosecutor are .
They are usually the people who are not jailed .
Thus , when it seems like the investigation will hit paydirt , there will be a huge stampede of disclosures by everyone , myself included , except for the really reallyreallyreallyreally guilty .
It 's like a bank rush , only disgusting , perverted , and with more fear .
This is the disclosure calculus .
If there is an actual prosecution which proceeds past the preliminary stages , like to an indictment , nobody will blame you for leaking .
If you run too soon , you 're outed as a leaker and you 're finished .
If you run too late , you stand a good chance of going to jail .
If you leak and then the investigation stalls and then fails , you are really fucking double dog finished with your buddies .
Find a new line of work , or lecture at some colleges or something .
Also , there will be containment strategies which governs who squeals and who goes on a vacation of silence .
This is handled by somebody within the party .
If you violate the containment strategy then people get very very angry and you are finished in this town , buddy .
The prosecutor 's game in these situations is to freak people out enough , or cause them enough personal grief , that they violate the containment strategy and cause the house of cards to fall .

Is this going to be a huge scandal in the future ?
I used to be able to predict which scandals would hit hard and which would roll off our back , but my spider sense is off recently .
Stuff I predicted would hit hard has fizzled and stuff that I did n't see coming really whacked us .
I 'm beginning to get creeped out , because it feels as though there is an X factor messing with stuff , like some kind of press - conspiracy .
For this reason I can't comfortably predict which scandals will take hold .
Sorry .
I think that the Kataryna scandal still has legs left in it , but if those fuckers down in the big easy keep being all corrupt and evil , they 'll take the limelight away from where it belongs , which is right here .

No contact with John Kerry except for long range surveilance while he does his thing .

Did the press pretty much get Katrina right , or could you tell us some stuff that was worse than the delays and unpreparedness that was reported ?
This is the one thing I can't talk about , because all of our sphincters are clenched about it still , and we are all genuinely perplexed about why the shittastrophe has not swept through the hill .
I did n't see any of the press coverage when the thing hit because I was incredibly busy with something , but I did check the clippers .
I think that somehow , the existence of the hurricane was so interesting and easy to report that they totally gave up on exposing our evil negligence .

So as a member of the House , I could see that a vote to go with Intel instead of AMD for all future government computer contracts will pass , so I invest accordingly ?
Yes , exactly .
You can even trade based upon your own personal vote .
But if a lobbyist for intel tells you a company secret in order to sway your vote , you can not trade on it .
There 's a big evil secret scandal going on right now with the following practice .
Before you meet with a lobbyist , buy a shitload of lowball stock options predicting the price of stock in that company .
Have a system worked out with your stockbroker with a pre-arranged signal unrelated to the stock options .
If he tells you good news , do not call .
If he tells you bad news , have a friend call and buy or sell an unrelated portion of stock .
The people doing this think they are so goddamned slick , but I know they 'll get busted for it .

Do you see yourself as ' loathsome ' ?

Do you feel that you 've had to compromise yourself for your job / position ?
Part of my job is producing justifications for things , so , just like everyone else here who wants to preserve a shred of their humanity , I think up justifications for my place in a system which , for a large part , visits a lot of evil upon innocents .
I try to think of the notion that it is not a government that does good , but a government which is stable that is of the most benefit to the people .
I also contemplate the notion of aggregate good ; that a few evil acts here and there from a necessarily flawed system is the best and only way of doing things .
I 'm sure that my co-workers think I 'm as loathsome to them as they are to me , but this is n't because I fuck children on the job .
As we compromise and are complicit with evil , we view others as having the same taint we perceive in ourselves .
I 'm sure that my co-workers see in me whatever brand of evil they empower through their own work .
This is why the squeaky clean individuals are so disturbing to all of us , because they must be completely disjointed and insane .

What a fucking psycho .
We 've speculated that he did that scooting as a toddler because of a throwback mongoloid mental defect that caused him to be unable to balance on his hind feet .
The fact that he is inhuman in his mannerisms supports this theory and I endorse it with my full backing .

The guy is like a heat seeking missile sometimes , I think he has a time allotted in his schedule book to HUNT people down and regail them with anecdotes from his empty life .

After reading about Tom Ridge 's OCD , I 've come to the conclusion that Tom Ridge = Adam West .
Many of us have made this comparison , and I 'm sure we did n't help his descent into madness at all .
Some people working around him would do stuff like whisper inaudibly and then deny doing anything at all , or subtly slip nonsensical words into their discussions .
We all WANTED to see him freak out , if only because none of us would get blamed .
After the rat incident people wanted to put like toupees and other hairy objects in his desk drawers but he had a personal assistant watching his office at all times to guard against this , so nothing was ever successfully planted .
I 'm glad for this , because I think he might have put himself in the hospital if he grabbed anything bulkier to beat his own legs with , and there 's no telling what he would have done a second time .
He also had this weird thing where he always wanted there to be a lot of blankets , no matter what he was planning , he demanded many many blankets , both for himself , and as supplies for his people .

We can stalk her , we can secretly trail behind to smell her , we can even go up to chairs she 's used and inhale deeply , but asking her this is beyond the bounds of decency and I will have none of it .

By people - moving , I mean the way they control the flow of individuals through the white house , segregating them from eachother and preventing collisions of staff , public , and visiting dignitaries .

Force Directed Graphs are self - organizing , visually appealing tools for representing relational data .
The look is organic , because algorithms simulate the way charged particles arrange in space .
They work great in user interfaces because the user has access to data nodes while the graph is being organized .
Take a look ( go ahead and play , they 're interactive ) :
Show Example
So , what am I using these for ?
Recently , I 've been considering alternatives to the traditional list and tree views used in search result user interfaces .
I 'm looking for display tools that can show relationships among results , rather than simply ranking them by score .
Force Directed Graphs looked promising , so I started writing this library to determine if a client - resident implementation in Javascript is a viable option .
Initial Findings
Performance :
As currently implemented , the graphing engine consumes a lot of processing power , even after the graph has settled .
An entropy - based throttle would help .
Scaling :
The layout algorithm has a complexity of On 2 :( .
It just does n't scale very well .
Next Steps
I need to produce some functional user interfaces .
Lists make very efficient use of space .
Users greatly benefit from lengthy titles , annotations , urls , and even thumbnail images in results .
It 'll certainly be a challenge to incorporate large amounts of text in a user interface based on force directed graphs .
Please please please leave a comment if you 've seen examples in the wild or have some suggestions .
I 'll be publishing the results here , so be sure to check back .

Pageflakes – bester Online - Desktop 2006
Die Produktpalette der Online Desktops ( Webbasierte persönliche Startseiten ) ist sehr schnell in den letzten Monaten gewachsen und Pageflakes ist eine der neusten und besten offenen Plattformen in diesem Bereich .
Andere Onlien Dektops , basierend auf der Ajax Technologie , wie Netvibes , Microsofts Live.com , Favoor , oder Google IG sind schon eine Weile auf dem Markt , und Pageflakes scheint , von vielen ihrer Fehler gelernt zu haben .
Die beste neue Eigenschaft , ist die Unterstützung von Multi Page Desktops , also Mehrfachseiten , dieses Feature bietet bisher noch kein anderer Ajax Schreibtisch .
Netvibes arbeitet schon länger an der gleichen Funktion , doch Pageflakes scheint die schnellsten Entwicklungs - Fortschritte zu machen .
Dies zeigt sich auch darin , das Pageflakes nicht nur eine geniale Plattform für Informationen via RSS Feed ist , zusätzlich kann eine Vielzahl von Extra - Funktionen ( Flakes ) per " drag and drop " auf einer beliebigen Seite des Online Desktops hinzugefügt werden .
Dies Umfasst auch Extra -Funktionen die andere Ajax Desktops nicht bieten , wie z.B. Adressbuch , Wörterbuch oder Todo Listen .
Pageflakes erweitert den Nutzen der Plattform durch sehr nützliche Flake - Module wie " Alexa Traffic " Diagramme , Flickr , Delicious , Gmail , Film - Finder , oder auch ein Preisvergleich und ein aktuelles TV - Serien - Programm .
( Preisvergleich und TV - Serien beziehen sich z.Z. aber nur auf amerikanische Services ) .
Aber die wirklich große Stärke von Pageflakes ist , wie bei allen guten Web 2,0 Services , die Möglichkeit seine eigenen Module für Pageflakes zu entwickeln und diese auch mit andere zu teilen .
Dadurch gibt es , obwohl Pageflakes erst gerade zur freien Nutzung freigegeben wurde , fast täglich neue innovative Module .
Dies ist ein entscheidender Vorteil für den Online Dektop Pageflakes , jeder kann seinen Desktop je nach belieben erweitern und weiterentwickeln .
Pageflakes läuft auch auf älteren Computern ziemlich schnell sowie alle gängigen Browser werden unterstützt , Firefox , Intenet Explorer und Opera .
( Mac Browser konnte ich leider nicht testen . )
Fast alle Module laufen schon sehr gut , und die Entwickler von Pageflakes sind wirklich schnell im Support sowie der Weiterentwicklung und Optimierung ihres Services .
Der Firmensitz von Pageflakes ist zwar in Deutschland aber das Gründer - Team ist sehr international .
Die deutsche Beteiligung lässt auf eine eine bessere deutsche Sprachunterstützung in naher Zukunft hoffen .
Pageflakes wurde mit dem bald erscheinenden " Atlas Framework für Ajax " von Microsoft entwickelt .
Als einziger Wärmutstropfen bleibt mir bisher die fehlende OPML Im - und Export Unterstüzung , damit ich alle meine gesammelten Feeds von Netvibes und News Alloy in bestehender Struktur auf einmal importieren kann .
Wie mir Ole Brandenburg , deutscher Mitgründer von Pageflakes , mitteilte , ist der OPML Import in der Entwicklung , und wird in den nächsten Tagen zur Verfügung stehen .
Bis dahin werde ich mich schon mal auf den Umzug von Netvibes zu Pageflakes vorbereiten .
Für die Nutzung von Pageflakes ist keine Anmeldung erforderlich .

def view ( request ) :
# you make changes to your objects , calling obj.save ( ) on them as normal
# when you commit , all changes to all objects will be commited to your database
transaction.commit ( )
# an excellent idea would be to wrap in a try / except block
try :
# do your stuff
except :
transaction.rollback ( )
else :

The trial is being seen as a first step to performing surgery in space .
The doctors removed a benign tumour from the arm of a volunteer as their plane made a series of swoops to mimic a reduced - gravity environment .
The medics and patient were strapped down for the procedure which was done inside a hygienic plastic tent .
Specially designed instruments were fitted with magnets to attach them to the metal operating table .
' Feasibility test '
The three - hour flight above south - west France used a modified Airbus A300 known as " Zero - G " , which flies parabolic curves that give its passengers 20 - second periods of weightlessness .
Now we know that a human being can be operated on in space without too many difficulties
Dominique Martin
Chief surgeon
The operation took no more than 11 minutes , with 31 weightless sequences .
Both patient and medical team were trained to cope with this free - fall environment in machines similar to those used by astronauts .
It is the first time such an operation has been carried out on a human being .
The Zero - G A300 flight gives 20 - second periods of weightlessness
" We were n't trying to perform technical feats but to carry out a feasibility test , " he said , quoted by AFP news agency .
" Now we know that a human being can be operated on in space without too many difficulties . "
With two hours of continuous weightlessness , surgeons could perform an appendectomy , Mr Martin added .
Earlier this year , the team mended an artery in a rat 's tail .
The next phase of the programme will be to carry out an operation using a robot controlled from the ground by satellite .
This experiment should take place within a year , Mr Martin explained .
Earthly spin-offs
The trials are part of a long - term project to study the possibility of carrying out surgery during long - distance space flights .
The patient ( L ) was administered a local anaesthetic before the flight
" When we are out of Earth 's gravitational attraction , it takes several days , at least , to come back .
So it will be necessary to organise tele - medicine and tele - surgery to be able to take care of astronaut health . "
The researchers say there could also be spin - offs for remote medicine on Earth .
The equipment could be used for emergencies in confined locations such as caves or in buildings toppled by earthquakes .
» Current justices | Chief justice duties | Court appointments | Special Chief Justice Rehnquist has died SPECIAL REPORT YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Supreme Court William H. Rehnquist or or Create Your Own WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Chief Justice William Rehnquist , who quietly advanced the conservative ideology of the Supreme Court under his leadership , died Saturday evening .
He was 80 .
The justice , diagnosed with thyroid cancer , had a tracheotomy and received chemotherapy and radiation as part of his treatment .
Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said Rehnquist had " continued to perform his duties on the Court until a precipitous decline in his health the last couple of days . "
Then with his three children beside him , the justice died at his suburban Virginia home , a court spokeswoman said .
Rehnquist had become increasingly frail after his cancer diagnosis last October , but his office had refused to characterize the seriousness of his illness .
Meanwhile , he 'd worked from home for several months and missed oral arguments in a number of cases .
President Bush learned of the death shortly before 11 p.m. ET Saturday , the White House said .
" The president and Mrs. Bush are deeply saddened by the passing of the chief justice , " according to a written statement .
It said Bush planned to make a statement Sunday morning .
End of term , end of speculation Rehnquist adjourned the court in late June and ended speculation about his resignation .
Hours after leaving the hospital in July following treatment for fever , he made a decree : " I want to put to rest the speculation and unfounded rumors of my imminent retirement , " he said in a written statement .
" I am not about to announce my retirement .
I will continue to perform my duties as chief justice as long as my health permits . "
He went to work the next day .
Four months earlier , when Rehnquist joined the other justices for the first time after a break , he showed no emotion , paid sharp attention to arguments and asked eight or nine technical questions .
Despite the tracheotomy tube in his throat to help him breathe , his voice was fairly strong .
A junior justice President Nixon appointed Rehnquist to the Supreme Court in 1972 , and in 1986 , President Reagan tapped him as chief justice to replace Warren Burger .
In that role , he led the closed - door conferences where justices discuss and vote on cases ; assigned who wrote the majority rulings ; managed the docket ; controlled open court arguments ; and supervised the 300 or so court employees , including clerks , secretaries , police and support staff .
Rehnquist , who belonged to a loose , 5 - 4 conservative majority , was the second - oldest man to preside over the nation 's highest court .
Early in his tenure , he often was the lone dissenter , despite the presence of two other Republican appointees .
David Yalof , a constitutional law professor at the University of Connecticut , credited Rehnquist with moving the court in a consistent , conservative direction .
" He was able , over time , to gather colleagues together cordially , manage tension , build a majority and turn them over to his point of view , " Yalof said .
Rehnquist followed the legal philosophy of judicial restraint , which interprets the U.S. Constitution narrowly .
He believed the only rights the Constitution protects are those the document names specifically , and justices should consider the framers ' original intent when making rulings .
Shortly after Nixon named him as an associate justice , Rehnquist and Justice Byron
White were the only dissenters in the landmark Roe v. Wade case ( 1973 ) , which established that a woman 's right to an abortion was protected under a woman 's right to privacy .
" To reach its result , the court necessarily has had to find within the scope of the 14th Amendment a right that was apparently completely unknown to the drafters of the amendment , " Rehnquist wrote in his dissent .
Making a mark
In 1999 , Rehnquist became the second chief justice in U.S. history to preside over a presidential impeachment -- that of President Bill Clinton , who was acquitted .
Having already sat on the court for 14 years , Rehnquist quickly matured in the role of chief justice .
He cut the number of cases the court agreed to hear , streamlined conferences and sought clearer , strongly reasoned opinions .
Jay Jorgensen , a former clerk for the chief justice , said it was the little things Rehnquist did that built personal trust , loyalty and respect among justices who were often sharply divided ideologically .
" He set up a system during conferences where every justice , one by one , in order of seniority , is allowed to weigh in on a case , " Jorgensen said .
" There is no free - for - all debate , the chief justice does not allow bickering . "
Saturday night , Ruth Wedgwood , a constitutional lawyer and close friend of Rehnquist , said , " He was an interesting man .
He had an interesting life .
Over time , I think he became a much more unifying figure in the court . "
His death , she said , puts a " great burden " on the Senate , which will be responsible for confirming a replacement .

Murray Rothbard once wrote that even the most brutal dictator ultimately bases his power on the opinions that are held by a majority of the population that is under his rule .
After all , even dictators with large armies tend to be vastly outnumbered by the populations they rule over , and revolution is always on the dictator ’s mind .
That ’s probably how he gained power himself in the first place — the previous dictator was , well , too dictatorial and created the conditions for his own overthrow .
Democratic regimes also base their legitimacy on their ability to claim that their rule is “ the will of the people . ”
They believe in democracy with all their will , they tell us , so much so that generations of American politicians have believed that it was legitimate to wage war on other nations and to kill thousands of their citizens to impose “ democracy ” on them .
Lincoln ’s armies killed some 300,000 fellow citizens and maimed for life an even greater number , supposedly so that “ government of the people , by the people , for the people , ” i.e. , democracy , shall not perish from the earth .
This of course was pure B.S. : Had the South seceded peacefully , democracy would have still existed in the U.S. , the Confederate States of America , Canada , England , France , etc. , etc .
Nevertheless , that was an official purpose of the war , and of numerous other American wars .
Woodrow Wilson brought America into World War I to supposedly “ make the world safe for democracy . ”
We are now supposedly bringing democracy to Iraq at bayonet point with numerous other Middle East countries in our sights .
But America was not founded as a democracy .
It was a constitutional republic .
The whole purpose of the Constitution , James Madison wrote in Federalist # 10 , was to control “ the violence of faction , ” by which he meant democracy .
That ’s why , until the Lincolnian “ Civil War Amendments ” were added to it , every part of the Constitution was a prohibition of some kind of governmental power or activity .
Democracy was made into a “ civil religion ” by Lincoln and subsequent generations of Lincolnites who have successfully overthrown the constitutional republic of the founding fathers .
These constitutional prohibitions or limitations are all but ignored today , of course .
The Constitution does not provide for the central government to get involved in education , let alone sending a man — and untold millions or billions of dollars — to Mars .
There are no longer any constitutional limitations on the central government .
Washington politicians laugh and sneer at libertarian think tank employees who occasionally appear before their committees to oppose this or that government program on constitutional grounds .
They laugh and say to them , “ we ’ve got the power to do it , and we ’re going to do it . ”
I ’ve seen it with my own eyes on C - SPAN .
President Clinton ’s Surgeon General , Joycelyn Elders , went so far as to assert that the constitution allowed for a federal masturbation education program .
Even Bill Clinton thought that went a little too far and fired the good doctor .
The Republican Party today stands for an explosive growth of the welfare state and is spending money on such programs as fast as Lyndon Johnson ever did .
The Democrats are as bad or worse .
On foreign policy the Republican Party is dominated by crazed Wilsonians who want to involve the U.S. military in perpetual global warfare “ to spread democracy . ”
As with all such imperialistic ventures , this would eventually bankrupt the country and create countless enemies who would like nothing better than to destroy us by the millions with nuclear weapons or poison .
The Democrats are as bad or worse .
Both political parties are competing to grant amnesty to all illegal aliens , as the first step along the way to allowing completely open borders .
Combining open borders with an explosively growing welfare state will invite all the deadbeats of the world to come to America , with all their extended family members in tow , to “ celebrate democracy ” by voting themselves more and more of the hard - earned dollars of those of us who work for a living in this country .
This would cause the welfare state to eventually eat up a huge portion of national income , probably half or more .
American taxpayers would be nothing but docile slaves to the Washington , D.C. plantation .
The government schools long ago gave up teaching anything significant about the founding fathers , the Constitution , and the philosophy of limited government — other than to trash and demean them .
In a democracy it is not in the state ’s best interest to educate its own citizens about the virtues of limited government , and ours does n’t .
And it certainly will never make any attempt to do so with the hordes of new immigrants it hopes to attract ( and register to vote ) .
Belief in the Constitution is essentially a lost cause .
That ’s why it is unpatriotic to vote .
Being patriotic in America means being devoted to the Constitution , if not the natural rights philosophy that motivated much of it .
Since neither of the major political parties has any interest whatsoever in enforcing the constitutional limitations on the state , they are all traitors to the Constitution ( with one lone exception , Congressman Ron Paul ) .
Anyone who supports them is also behaving in a traitorous manner .
That is , anyone who votes for any of them .
Voting only allows these traitors to the Constitution to proclaim that “ the people have spoken ” and “ I am your president , ” or congressman , senator , governor , or whatever .
Their legitimacy rests solely on their ability to make this claim .
Imagine what a patriotic thrill you would receive if , in the next presidential election , a mere 10 percent of the electorate , instead of the usual 50 percent or so , voted .
The unconstitutional regime in Washington would be de-legitimized .
The upside is that it might just be possible that some politicians in Washington would get the message and start behaving more like a George Washington or Thomas Jefferson than a Tony Soprano or Vito Corleone ( with apologies to all the distinguished Italian - Americans out there ) .
The downside is that they will keep on behaving as they do now — with complete contempt for the Constitution and the population it is supposed to benefit .
So be patriotic : Do n’t vote .
The Best of Thomas DiLorenzo
Citing parking problems and a supposed strain on public services , the Riverside , New Jersey township committee unanimously passed a Hazleton - style anti-immigrant ordinance in July to punish those who hire or rent housing to undocumented immigrants .
Now the struggling business district of the town of 8,000 , near Camden , is seeing a “ devastating impact ” from the law , reports the Courier - Post :
Franco Ordonez , a native of Ecuador who runs the King Chicken restaurant on Scott Street , says five Latino - owned businesses have closed in recent weeks as the township has stepped up its efforts to crack down on illegal immigrants .
Ordonez said he expects two or three more to close within a month .
“ People are scared of what ’s being done , ” he said .
“ Almost the entire population is gone . ”
Meanwhile older , more traditional businesses have also suffered .
Dave Ercolani , owner of Foster ’s Hardware , figures his business is down by one - third .
“ I ’m going to be out of here in three months , ” said Ercolani , 64 , who hastened to add that he planned to retire “ long before this happened . ”
According to a Latino business group , the Riverside Coalition of Business Persons and Landlords , “ sales at about 25 commercial establishments have fallen 50 percent ” due to the ordinance .
In Hazleton , Pennsylvania itself — where just one year ago the mayor cited immigrants as having revitalized the city ’s economy — one business area has gone from bustling to boarded - up in just three weeks .
Nevertheless , on Wednesday Riverside ’s council voted to bolster its ordinance .
More anti-immigrant ordinances are being introduced in Arcadia , Wisconsin ; Altoona , Pennsylvania ; and Wilkes - Barre , Pennsylvania .
In Forty Fort , Pennsylvania – where a “ pre-emptive ” ordinance ultimately failed to pass last week – somebody is anonymously putting up fliers warning of the supposed threat from immigrants and issuing a “ wake - up call to Americans to become active in defense of our nation ’s rule of law . ”

NAME
Acme:: EyeDrops - Visual Programming in Perl
SYNOPSIS
use Acme: : EyeDrops qw( sightly ) ; print sightly ( { Shape => ' camel ' , SourceFile => ' eyesore.pl ' } ) ;
DESCRIPTION
Acme :: EyeDrops converts a Perl program into an equivalent one , but without all those unsightly letters and numbers .
In a Visual Programming breakthrough , EyeDrops allows you to pour the generated program into various shapes , such as UML diagrams , enabling you to instantly understand how the program works just by glancing at its new and improved visual representation .
Unlike Acme :: Bleach and Acme:: Buffy , the generated program runs without requiring that Acme : : EyeDrops be installed on the target system .
EXAMPLES
Getting Started
Suppose you have a program , helloworld.pl , consisting of :
print " hello world
" ;
To convert this little program into an equivalent camel - shaped one , create cvt.pl as follows :
# cvt.pl .
Convert helloworld.pl into a camel shape .
use Acme: : EyeDrops qw( sightly ) ; print sightly ( { Shape => ' camel ' , SourceFile => ' helloworld.pl ' , Regex => 1 } ) ;
Then run it like this :
perl cvt.pl >new.pl
After inspecting the newly created program , new.pl , to verify that it does indeed resemble a camel , run it :
perl new.pl
to confirm it behaves identically to the original helloworld .pl .
Instead of using the API , as shown above , you may find it more convenient to use the sightly .
pl command in the demo directory :
sightly .pl -h ( for help ) sightly .
pl -s camel -f helloworld.pl -r 1 > new.pl cat new.pl ( should look like a camel ) perl new.pl ( should print " hello world " as before )
Notice that the shape ' camel ' is just the file camel.eye in the EyeDrops sub - directory underneath where EyeDrops.pm is located , so you are free to add your own new shapes as required .
For the meaning of Regex => 1 above , see the Just another Perl hacker section below .
Making Your Programs Easier to Understand
If your boss demands a UML diagram describing your program , you can give him this :
print sightly ( { Shape => 'uml ' , SourceFile => ' helloworld.pl ' , Regex => 1 } ) ;
If it is a Windows program , you can indicate that too , by combining shapes :
print sightly ( { Shape => 'uml , window ' , Gap => 1 , SourceFile => ' helloworld.pl ' , Regex => 1 } ) ;
producing this improved visual representation :
''=~ ('( '.'?'.'{'.('` ' | ' % ' ) . ( '[ '^ '-' ) . ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ' ` ' ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) |'!' ) . ( ' ` ' | ' , ' ) . ' " '. ('[ '^ ( ( ( ( ( '+ ' ) ) ) ) ) ) . (' [ ' ^ ' ) ' ) . ( '` ' | ' ) ' ) . ( '` '| '. ' ) . ( ( ' [ ' ) ^ ( ( ( ( ' / ' ) ) ) ) ) . ('{'^'[ ' ) .'\\'. ( ' " ' ) . ( ' ` ' | ' ( ' ) . ( '` ' | ' % ' ) . ( '` ' | " \ , " ) . ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ' ` ' ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) | " \ , " ) . ( ' ` '| ' /' ) . ('{'^ ' [ ' ) . ( ' [ ' ^ " \ , " ) . ( '` '| ' /' ) . ( ' [ ' ^ ' ) ' ) . ( ' ` ' | ' , ' ) . ( '` ' | ' $ ' ) .'\\'.'\\' .('`'| '.') .'\\'.'" '.';'.('!'^'+') .' " '.'}'. " \ ) " ) ; $ :='.'^'~' ;$ ~='@'| '( ' ; $ ^= ' ) ' ^ '[ ' ; $ /='` ' | " \. " ; $ , = " \ ( " ^ ( ( ' } ' ) ) ; ( $ \ ) =( ' ` ' ) | " \! " ; $ : =' ) '^ " \} " ; $ ~ ='* '| " \` " ; $ ^ ='+ '^ " \_ " ; $/ ='& '| " \@ " ; $ , =' [ '& " \~ " ; $ \ =' , '^ " \| " ; $ : ='. '^ " \~ " ; $ ~ ='@ '| " \ ( " ; $ ^ =' ) '^ '[ ' ; $ /='`'| '. ' ;$ , ='( ' ^'} ' ; $ \='` '| ' !' ;$ :=' ) ' ^'} ' ; ( $ ~ ) = ( ( '*' ) ) |'` ' ; $ ^ ='+'^ " \_ " ; $/ ='& '| " \@ " ; $ , =' [ '& " \~ " ; $ \ =' , '^ " \| " ; $ : ='. '^ " \~ " ; $ ~ ='@ '| " \ ( " ; $ ^ =' ) ' ^ " \ [ " ; $/ ='` '| " \. " ; $ , ='( '^ " \} " ; $ \ ='` '| '!' ; $ :=' ) ' ^'} ';$ ~='*'|'` ' ; $ ^='+'^'_' ; $ /='&' |'@ ' ; $ , ='[ '& '~ ' ; $ \= ' , ' ^'| ' ; $ :='.'^'~' ;$ ~='@ ' | " \ ( " ; $^= ' ) ' ^ '[ ' ; $ /='`'| '. ' ;$ , ='( ' ^'} ' ; $ \='` '| ' !'; $ :=' ) ' ;
This is a Visual Programming breakthrough in that you can tell it is a Windows program and see its UML structure too , just by glancing at the code .
For Linux only , you can apply its /usr / games / banner command to the program 's source text :
print sightly ( { Shape => ' srcbanner ' , Width => 70 , SourceFile => ' helloworld.pl ' , Regex => 1 } ) ;
The generated program is easier to understand than the original because its characters are bigger and easier to read .
An Abbreviated History of Perl 6
Here is a summary of the Perl 6 development effort so far :
print sightly ( { Shape => ' jon , larry , damian , simon , parrot , ' . ' buffy3, autrijus ' , Gap => 3 , Regex => 1 , Print => 1 , Indent => 1 , SourceString => <<' END_HAIKU ' } ) ;

Just another Perl hacker
Let 's get more ambitious and create a big self - printing JAPH .
my $ src = <<' FLAMING_OSTRICHES ' ; open 0 ; $/ = undef ; $x = < 0 > ; close 0 ; $ x =~ tr/!-~/#/; print $ x ; FLAMING_OSTRICHES
print sightly ( { Shape => ' japh ' , SourceString => $ src , Regex => 1 } ) ;
This works .
However , if we change :
$x =~ tr/!-~/#/;
to :
$x =~ s/\S/#/g ;
the generated program malfunctions in strange ways because it is running inside a regular expression and Perl 's regex engine is not reentrant .
In this case , we must resort to :
print sightly ( { Shape => ' japh ' , SourceString => $ src , Regex => 0 } ) ;
which runs the generated sightly program via eval instead .
If you want to use Regex => 1 ( to eliminate all alphanumerics ) , ensure the program to be converted is careful with its use of regular expressions and $ _ .
To produce a JAPH that resembles the original Just another Perl hacker , aka Randal L Schwartz , try this :
print sightly ( { Shape => ' merlyn ' , SourceString => ' Just another Perl hacker , ' , Regex => 1 , Print => 1 } ) ;
producing :
''=~ ('('.'?'.'{'.('[ ' ^'+ ' ) . ( ' [ ' ^ ' ) ' ) . ( '` ' | ' ) ' ) . ( ' ` '| '. ' ) . ('[ '^'/') .' " '.('` '^ '*' ) .('[ ' ^'. ' ) .('[ ' ^'( ' ) . ('[ ' ^' /' ) .('{'^ ' [ ' ) . ( " \` " | '!

' ;( $ : ) =( ' ) ' ) ^ ( '} ' ) ; ( $ ~ ) = '*' |'` ' ; ( ( ( $ ^ ) ) ) = ( ( ( '+' ) ) ) ^ ( ( ( ' _' ) ) ) ; ( ( ( $/ ) ) ) = ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ' & ' ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) |'@ ' ; ( ( ( ( ( ( ( $ , ) ) ) ) ) ) ) = ( (( (( ( ( ( ( ( (( ( ( ( ( '[ ' ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) & ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ' ~ ' ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
Buffy Looking in the Mirror
Because the sightly encoding is not very compact , you sometimes find yourself playing a surreal form of Perl Golf , where the winner is the one with the smallest f.tmp in :
sightly.pl -r 1 -f program_to_be_converted > f.tmp
Apart from reducing the ( key - ) stroke count , you must avoid regexes and strive to replace alphanumeric characters with sightly ones , which do not require sightly encoding .
To illustrate , consider the intriguing problem of creating Buffy looking in the mirror .
Let 's start with k.pl :
open $ [ ; chop , ( $==y===c ) > $ - &&( $ -=$=) for@ : = <0 > ; print $ " x-(y ---c-$-) .reverse.$ / for@ :
Notice that EyeDrops - generated programs , by default , contain no trailing spaces , which complicates the above program .
Buffy looking in the mirror can now be created with :
sightly.pl -r 1 -f k.pl -s buffy2 > b.pl cat b.pl ( should show Buffy 's face ) perl b.pl ( should show Buffy looking in the mirror )
Drat .
This requires two buffy2 shapes .
What to do ?
Well , you could use the TrailingSpaces attribute ( - T switch to sightly . pl ) to append the required number of trailing spaces to each line , allowing you to write a briefer kk.pl :
open $ %;chop , print+reverse.$/for<0 >
and finally produce Buffy looking in the mirror with :
sightly.pl - T -r 1 -f kk.pl -s buffy2 > bb.pl
Alternatively , the Compact attribute ( -m switch to sightly .
pl ) could be used to produce a solution free of any trailing spaces :
sightly.pl -m -r 1 -f k.pl -s buffy2 > buffy.pl cat buffy.pl ( should show Buffy 's face ) perl buffy.pl ( should show Buffy looking in the mirror )
producing buffy.pl :
''=~ ( '( ?{'. ( ' ` ' | ' % ' ) . ( '[ '^ '-' ) . ( '` '| ' ! ' ) . ( ' ` ' | ' , ' ).+ ( ' " ' ) . ( ( ' ` ' ) |+ ( '/' ) ) . ( ' [ ' ^(( ( '+ ' ) ) ) ) . ( ' ` ' | (( ' % ' ) ) ) .
( ' ` ' | (( '.' ) ) ).+ ( (( (( ( ( (( ( (( ( ( ( (( ( (( ( '\\ ' ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) .'$ [ ; ' . ( ( ( (( ( ( ( ( ( (( ( ( (( ( ( ( ( ( '` ' ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) | ( ( ( ( (( ' # ' ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ( ( '` ' ) | ( ' ( ' ) ) . ( ' ` '| ' /' ) . ( ' [ '^ '+' ) .', ( \\$ ' .'=='. (' [ ' ^' " ' ) . '==='.+( ' ` ' | '# ' ) . ' ) ' . '>\\$ -' .'& &( \\$ - =\\ ' . '$ = ) ' . ( ' ` ' |'&' ) . ( ' `' | ( ' / ' ) ) . ( ' [ ' ^ ' ) ' ) .'\\' . '@ :=<' . ( ' ^ '^ ( ( '` ' ) | " \. " ) ) . ( '>' ) . (' ; ' ) . ( '!'^'+' ) .('[ '^'+' ) . ( ' [ ' ^ ' ) ' ) . ( '` '| ' ) ' ) . ( " \` " | " \. " ) . ( ( ( ' [ ' ) ) ^ " \ / " ) .'\\$ \\ " ' . ( ( " \ [ " ) ^ ( ( ( ( " \ # " ) ) ) ) ) . ( ( ' - ' ) ) . ( ( ( ( ' ( ' ) ) ) ) . ( ( ( ' [ ' ) ) ^ ( ( ' " ' ) ) ) .'--' . '-'. ( ( ( '` ' ) ) | ' # ' ) . ( ( ( ( ' - ' ) ) ) ) .
( ( ( ( ( '\\ ' ) ) ) ) ) . ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ' $ ' ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) .'-).'. ('[ '^ ( ( ( ' ) ' ) ) ) ) . ('` ' | ' % ' ) . ('[ '^'-' ) . ('` ' | ' % ' ) . ( ( ' [ ' ) ^ ( ( ' ) ' ) ) ) . ('[ '^ '( ' ) . ( '` ' | ' % ' ) .'.\\$ /'. ('` ' | '& ' ) . ( ( ( '` ' ) ) | ' /' ) . ( ' [ ' ^ ' ) ' ) .'\\@ :'.('!'^'+' ) . ' " } ) ' ) ; $ := ( ( '. ' ) ) ^'~' ;$ ~='@'| '( ' ; $ ^= ' ) ' ^ '[ ' ; $ /='`'| '. ' ;$ , ='(' ;
This is perhaps a cleaner solution , though some people find the plain sightly encoding more pleasing to the eye .
Showing the face upside down , rather than reflected , is more easily solved with :
open $ %;print+reverse<0 >
and easier still for a self - printing shape :
open $ %; print <0 > # self printing open $ %; print+map{y ;!-~;# ;;$ _}<0 > # replace sightly with '# '
A Somersaulting Camel
Let 's extend the Buffy example of the previous section to produce a camel - shaped program capable of somersaulting across the screen when run .
We start with a generator program , gencamel.pl :
print sightly ( { Regex => 1 , Compact => 1 , RemoveNewlines => 1 , Indent => 1 , BorderGapRight => 1 , Shape => ' camel ' , SourceString => <<' END_SRC_STR ' } ) ; $ ~ =pop | | ''; open $ % ; y , !-~ , # , , s , ( . ) . , $+ , gs , $ ~&&( $_=reverse) for@~=grep$ | --,('') x18,<0 > ; @ ;=map~~reverse,reverse@~ ; map{system$^O=~Win?CLS :'clear ' ; ( $ - =$ _%3 ) | | ( -- $| , map$_=reverse , @~ , @ ; ) ; print $ " x ( $ =/ 3* abs $ | * 2-$ -) , $ _ , $ / for$ -&1?@ ; :@~ ; sleep !
$ %} $ %..11 END_SRC_STR
Note the use of the Compact and RemoveNewlines attributes , necessary here to squeeze the above program into a single camel shape .
Running this program :
perl gencamel.pl >camel.pl
produces camel.pl :

You can run camel.pl like this :
perl camel.pl normal forward somersaulting camel perl camel.pl b camel somersaults backwards perl camel.pl please do a backward somersault same thing
You are free to add a leading #!/usr / bin/perl -w line to camel.pl , so long as you also add a blank line after this header line .
Twelve Thousand and Thirty Two Camels
In a similar way to the somersaulting camel described above , we create a camel - shaped program capable of emitting twelve thousand and thirty two different camels when run .
As usual , we start with a generator program , gencamel.pl :
print sightly ( { Regex => 1 , Compact => 1 , RemoveNewlines => 1 , BorderGap => 1 , Shape => ' camel ' , SourceString => <<' END_SRC_STR ' } ) ; $ ~ =uc shift ; $ : =pop | | '#'; open $ % ;chop( @~= <0 > ) ;$ ~=~R&& ( @~=map{$-=$_+$_;join '' , map/.{$-}(. )/, @~}$ %..33 ) ; $ |-- &$ ~=~H&&next , $~!~Q&&eval "y , , \Q$ : \E , c " , $ ~= ~ I && eval "y , \ Q$ : \E , \Q$ : \E , " , $ ~=~M&&( $_=reverse ) , print$ ~=~V ?/(. ).?/g:$_,$/for$~=~U?reverse@~:@~
END_SRC_STR
Running this program :
perl gencamel.pl >camel.pl
produces camel.pl , which you can run like this :
perl camel.pl normal camel perl camel.pl q quine ( program prints itself ) perl camel.pl m mirror ( camel looking in the mirror ) perl camel.pl i inverted camel perl camel.pl u upside - down camel perl camel.pl r rotated camel perl camel.pl h horizontally - squashed camel perl camel.pl v vertically - squashed camel
And can further combine the above options , each combination producing a different camel , for example :
perl camel.pl uri
produces a large , bearded camel with a pony - tail , glasses , and a tie - dyed T - shirt . :)
camel.pl also accepts an optional second argument , specifying the character to fill the camel with ( default # ) .
For example :
perl camel.pl hv small camel filled with # perl camel.pl hv " $ " small camel filled with $
Why 12,032 camels ?
Combining the main options q , m , i , u , r , h , v can produce 128 different camels .
And there are 94 printable characters available for the second argument , making a total of 128 * 94 = 12,032 camels .
Naked Arm Wrestling
The final auction at Y:: E 2002 in Munich featured an epic athletic contest which you can remember with :
use Acme: : EyeDrops qw( sightly ) ; my $s = sightly ( { Regex => 1 , Shape => ' naw ' , Indent => 1 , SourceString => <<' NAKED_ARM_WRESTLING ' } ) ; $ /=''; open $ % ; $x= <0 > ; $y= <0 > ; substr ( $y , 428 , $ % ) ='

$s =~ s/ +$ //m ; print $s ;

Running this program :
print sightly ( { Shape => ' baghdad ' , Regex => 1 , Compact => 1 , RemoveNewlines => 1 , BorderGap => 1 , BorderWidthLeft => 3 , BorderWidthRight => 3 , BorderWidthTop => 2 , BorderWidthBottom => 8 , SourceString => <<' FAMOUS_COMICAL_ALI_QUOTES ' } ) ; warn + (

99 Bottles of Beer
The web site http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net/
features programs to display the lyrics of the famous 99 bottles of beer song in over 700 different computer languages .
Over the years , many different Perl solutions have been proposed .
On December 25 1998 , for instance , Damian Conway suggested using his Lingua : : EN : : Inflect module :
use Lingua:: EN :: Inflect ' inflect ' ; $ n=shift||99 ; print inflect << BURP while $ n ; NO ( bottle of beer , $n ) on the wall , NO ( bottle of beer , $n ) !
Take one down , pass it around , NO ( bottle of beer , @{ [ - - $ n]} ) on the wall .
BURP
During May 2003 , the two leading Perl golfers of that era , Ton Hospel and Mtv Europe , produced the shortest known Perl solution :
sub b{[@b=( abs||No , bottle ."s " x !!++$_, of , beer ) , on , the , wall ] }print " @{+b} ,
@b ,
Take one down , pass it around ,
@{+b} .
" for - pop | | - 99 ..- 1
Some years later I noticed that this program can be further shortened by changing " s " to 's ' and embedding the sub inside the first @{} block like so :
@{sub b{[@b=(abs||No,bottle.'s'x !!++$_, of , beer ) , on , the , wall ] }b}
This saves a stroke because the first +b in the original is replaced by a bald b .
Elegant though this solution is , they may have felt a little gobsmacked when the world 's leading HQ9 + golfer , Casey West , uncorked a one stroke solution ( 9 ) in that surreal programming language .
To produce a solution shaped like a row of beer bottles , run this :
use Acme: : EyeDrops qw( sightly get_eye_string hjoin_shapes ) ; my $ ninety_nine = <<' BURP ' ; $ ==pop
||99 ;--$=; sub _{($ ;=( $=||No ) . " bottle " . " s " x !!--$=. " of beer " ) . " on the wall "} print+_ , " , $ ; !
Take one down , pass it around , " , _ , " ! " while ++$= BURP chop ( $ ninety_nine ) ; $ ninety_nine =~ s/
print / print / ; print sightly ( { Regex => 1 , Compact => 1 , ShapeString => hjoin_shapes ( 2 , ( get_eye_string ( ' bottle2 ' ) ) x6 ) , SourceString => $ ninety_nine } ) ;
producing :

A larger single beer bottle shape can be produced with :
print sightly ( { Regex => 1 , Compact => 1 , Shape => ' bottle ' , SourceString => $ ninety_nine } ) ;
while the canonical solution , shaped like 99 bottles of beer , can be generated with :
print sightly ( { Regex => 1 , ShapeString => join ( "
" , ( hjoin_shapes ( 3 , ( get_eye_string ( ' bottle2 ' ) ) x3) ) x33 ) , SourceString => $ ninety_nine } ) ;
Sierpinski Triangles
A simple and concise Sierpinski triangle generator , siertri.pl , is :
#! perl -l $ x =2 ** pop ; print $ " x -- $x , map$x &$ _ ? $ " x2 : " / \\ " ,0..$y++ while$x
which was posted by Mtv Europe to golf@perl.org on 14 - sep - 2002 as a one stroke improvement on Adam Antonik 's original program .
Running :
perl siertri.pl 4
displays a Sierpinski triangle with 2 ** 4 lines .
Proclaiming Mtv's program as the shortest ( in Acme : : EyeDrops 1.13 ) only served to provoke Adam Antonik and Eugene van der Pijll into shortening it by exploiting a hard $ ^F , as shown in some of the examples below :
- l print $ " x -- $x , map$x &$ _ ? $ " x2 : " / \\ " , 0..$ _- 1 for 1..( $x =2**pop ) -l $ x =2 * * pop ; print $ " x -- $x , map$x &$ _ ? $ " x2 : " / \\ " ,0..$y++ while$x -l $ ^ F ** =pop ; print $ " x --$ ^F , map$ ^F&$_ ? $ " x2 : " / \\ " ,0..$y++ while$ ^F - lX061 print$ " x --$ / , map$ /&$_? $ " x2 : " / \\ " , 0..$y++ while$ /<< =pop - l print $ " x --$ ^F , map$ ^F&$_ ? $ " x2 : " / \\ " ,0..$y++ while $ ^F*=2**pop -l $ _= $ " x2 ** pop ; $_= " $ '/ \\ " , print , s / ( ?< =\\ ) ../$ &^KI^D5/egwhile /^ /
An interesting obfuscated Sierpinski triangle generator is :
#!/usr/bin/perl -l s--@{[( gE^Ge ) =~/[ ^g^e ] / g ]}[g^e ] x ((!!+~~g^e^g^e ) << pop ) .!
gE-ge , s - [ ^ge^ge ] -s , , , , s, @{ [ ( g^ ' ; ' ) . ( e^ ' ? ' ) ] } , ( G^ ' / ' ) . ( E^ '| ' )
^Ge , ge , print , s , ( ?<=/[ ^g^e ] ) [ ^g^e ] [ ^g^e ] , $& ^( G^ ' / ' ) . ( E^ '| ' )
^gE, ge-ge
As an alternative obfu , you can produce a Sierpinski triangle - shaped Sierpinski triangle generator based on Mtv 's program like this :
print sightly ( { Regex => 1 , Compact => 1 , RemoveNewlines => 1 , Indent => 1 , BorderGap => 1 , BorderWidth => 2 , # For ' siertri ' built - in shape , Width= > 5 means : # height is 2 ** 5 lines # width is 2 * 2** 5 characters Width => 5 , Shape => ' siertri ' , SourceString => <<' END_SRC_STR ' } ) ; $ -=!$ %<< ( pop | |4 ) ; print $ " x $ -, map ( $ - &$ _ ? ' ':'/\\' , $ %..$.++ ) , $/ while $ --- END_SRC_STR
producing :

Dueling Dingos
During the TPR02 Perl Golf tournament , `/ anick composed a poem describing his experience , entitled Dueling Dingos .
You can produce a program that emits his moving poem like this :

To generate a shorter program summarising ` / anick 's TPR02 anguish :
print sightly ( { Shape => ' yanick , eye , mosquito , coffee ' , Gap => 3 , Regex => 1 , Print => 1 , SourceString => <<' END_SUFFERING ' } ) ;

Error Handling
The sightly function returns a properly shaped program string ; there is no error return .
If something is badly wrong , die is called .
So if you are calling sightly in an environment where it 's unacceptable to die , be sure to wrap the sightly call in an eval block .
For example :
eval { $ prog = sightly ( { Shape => ' invalid- shape ' , SourceFile => ' eyesore.pl ' , InformHandler => sub {} } ) ; } ; if ( $@ ) { warn " sightly died : $@
" }
EyeDropping EyeDrops.pm
To illustrate EyeDropping a non-trivial module , we convert EyeDrops.pm itself into a bunch o' camels , via the following generator program , mkeye.pl :
use Acme: : EyeDrops qw( sightly ) ; # Slurp EyeDrops.pm into $ orig string .
my $ orig = Acme:: EyeDrops::slurp_yerself ( ) ; # Split $ orig into the source ( $src ) and the pod ( $ doc ) .
my ( $ src , $ doc ) = split ( /
1 ;
/ , $orig , 2 ) ; # Remove the line containing $ eye_dir = __FILE__ ... # because this line confuses eval .
$ src =~ s/^( my \ $eye_dir\b .*) $ // m ; # Generate the new sightly version of EyeDrops.pm. print $ 1 , sightly ( { Regex => 0 , Compact => 1 , TrapEvalDie => 1 , FillerVar => '; # ' , Shape => ' camel ' , Gap => 1 , SourceString => $ src } ) , " ;
1 ;
" , $ doc ;
Running this program :
perl mkeye.pl >m.tmp
produces m.tmp , which can be copied over the top of the original EyeDrops.pm in the Acme directory .
Though the new bunch o' camels version passes the regression test suite , it 's about 4 times slower than the original .
Notice that we used Regex => 0 ( since EyeDrops.pm uses many regular expressions ) , TrapEvalDie => 1 ( since EyeDrops.pm calls the die function ) and FillerVar => '; # ' ( to avoid possible warnings due to unused variables ) .
Notice too that the only known eval - hostile line in EyeDrops.pm :
my $ eye_dir = __FILE__ ; ...
was extracted and inserted at the top of the new file .
Encoding Binary Files
But wait , there 's more .
You can encode binary files too .
print sightly ( { Shape => ' camel , mongers ' , SourceFile => ' some_binary_file ' , Binary => 1 , Print => 1 , Gap => 3 } ) ;
This is prettier than uuencode / uudecode .
To encode :
sightly .pl - g3 - bps camel , mongers -f some_binary_file > eyesore
To decode :
perl eyesore > f.tmp
To verify it worked :
cmp f.tmp some_binary_file

On 15 August 2003 , Perl / Parrot Euro - hacker and modern artist Leon Brocard ( pictured above ) marched into a secluded aranciate - blessed , orange - walled room at MoMA and tossed a black Victoria 's Secret bra ( pictured below ) into the air , thereby creating a brilliant contemporary site - specific art exhibit .

The bra , donated by Elaine - HFB - Ashton , was bought by the artist expressly for this artwork at the YAPC :: Europe 2003 auction .
An interpretation of Brocard 's modern masterpiece is given below :
Victoria Bra , Secret Tango ( 2003 ) L. Brocard 1976 -
This , the third work in Brocard 's acclaimed " Naranja " sequence , explodes the theme of semantic [ a ] chromatic aspects of aranciata visual perception , first explored in his celebrated " Buffy " series , and fully explores the concept of supporting relationships , which were touched on in his earlier works .
The site 's central artifact is a stark reminder of the lack of support in contemporary relationships , with the jumbled juxtaposition of its two cups , indicative of being discarded in a hurry , symbolizing the excessive rapidity and tautness of modern life .
As always with Brocard , it is vital to consider the intertextuality of the title of the work , in order to deconstruct the surface meaning of the work itself and penetrate , as it were , to the kernel of the work 's " meaning " , if such a concept is still relevant in the present context .
Consider , for example , the word " Victoria " : does it express the moniker of the bra's former occupant or merely the state or district in which she was born ?
And what of " Secret Tango " ?
Is it , in the context of the universe that is the present work , merely indicative of the site 's location and visual perception , or does it suggest the bra's former resident once furtively enjoyed a rhythmic dance of long gliding steps and sudden pauses with the artist ?
The viewer will no doubt at this point recall that the word " tango " rhymes with " mango " and thereby grasp the semantic thrust of the work 's title .
However , the installation itself has even more to reveal when the particularly observant viewer speculates on the site 's central device being strapped to its current owner 's chiseled torso .
This work is extremely fragile .
Please do not touch .

My Dark Tunnels teammate
Taffy is devoted to , and firmly believes in , a love calculator web site where you type in two names and it reports your love compatibility .
Accordingly , the love compatibility of our entire team was calculated , and found to be disappointingly low , with one notable exception .
Taffy and Muss recorded an astonishingly high love compatibility of ninety nine percent , the highest ever recorded !
As a tribute to their affectionate and touching bromance , I wrote this program :
use Acme: : EyeDrops qw( sightly get_eye_string hjoin_shapes ) ; print sightly ( { ShapeString => hjoin_shapes ( 3 , ( get_eye_string ( ' heart2 ' ) ) x2 ) , SourceString =>
" Muss and Taffy have 99 % Love Compatibility
" , Regex => 1 , Print => 1 } ) ;
to generate :

By the way , this is the same heart shape that Perl Monk Falkkin used to successfully propose to his girlfriend Kristen in August 2004 .
Buffy Goes to the Cricket
Buffy fans might like to rotate her letters :
print sightly ( { Shape => ' buffy ' , Rotate => 0 , # try 270 , 90 and 180 RotateType => 1 , # try 0 , 1 , 2 SourceFile => ' helloworld.pl ' , Regex => 1 } ) ;
or have her ride a pony :
print sightly ( { Shape => ' buffy3, buffy4, riding , a,pony ' , SourceString =>
" This is how Catherine the " .

" , Gap => 2 , Regex => 1 , Print => 1 } ) ;
while cricket fans might create a reduced , inverted shape with :
print sightly ( { Shape => ' cricket ' , Reduce => 1 , Invert => 1 , BorderWidth => 1 , SourceFile => ' helloworld.pl ' , Regex => 1 } ) ;

Snowflakes
The Text and TextFiller attributes ( -t / -u switches to sightly .
pl ) are handy when you simply want to pour some unsightly text into a shape .
To illustrate , consider an entry in the Cam.pm 2002 Christmas programming contest , snowing .
pl :
$ _=q~vZvZ& % ( '$ & " ' " &( & " & $ & " ' " &$ Z$ # $ $ $ # $ %$ & " ' " &( & # %$ & " ' " & # Z # $ $ $ # % # %$ % $ % $ %( %%%# %$ %$ % # Z " %*# $ %$ % $ %$ %(%%%# %$ %$ % # Z " % , ( $ % $ % $ % ( % % %# %$ %$ % # Z " % * % " % $ % $ %$ %(% %%# %$ %$ %#Z# %% " # %# % $ % $ %$ %$ # #&# % $ % $ %$ %# Z$ & " " $ % " & $ % $ % $ % # % " % " & % % $ %$ %#Z %& %&# % " ' " ' " ' # ## % * ' " ' " ' " ZT % ?ZT %?

The rules of this contest state that the program source code must fit precisely into the provided snowflake shape .
To comply , you can pour the above program into the required shape with :
sightly .pl -s snow -f snowing .
pl -t -u# -n1 >snowflake.pl
or equivalently ( using the API instead of sightly . pl ) :
print sightly ( { Shape => ' snow ' , SourceFile => ' snowing.pl ' , Text => 1 , TextFiller => '# ' , Indent => 1 } ) ;
producing a valid entry , snowflake.pl :

REFERENCE
Sightly Encoding
There are 32 characters in the sightly character set :
! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / ( 33 - 47 ) : ; < = > ? @ ( 58 - 64 ) [ \ ] ^ _ ` ( 91 - 96 ) { | } ~ ( 123 -126 )
A sightly string consists only of characters drawn from this set .
The ascii_to_sightly function converts an ASCII string ( 0 - 255 ) to a sightly string ; the sightly_to_ascii function does the reverse .

make_siertri WIDTH
Returns a Sierpinski triangle shaped string containing 2**WIDTH lines .
make_banner WIDTH STRING
Linux only .

invert_shape SHAPESTRING
Invert a shape .
reflect_shape SHAPESTRING
Reflect a shape .
reduce_shape SHAPESTRING FACT
Reduce the size of a shape by a factor of FACT .
expand_shape SHAPESTRING FACT
Expand the size of a shape by a factor of FACT .
rotate_shape SHAPESTRING DEGREES RTYPE FLIP
Rotate a shape clockwise thru 90 , 180 or 270 degrees .
RTYPE=0 big rotated shape , RTYPE=1 small rotated shape , RTYPE=2 squashed rotated shape .
FLIP=1 to flip ( reflect ) shape in addition to rotating it .
RTYPE and FLIP do not apply to 180 degrees .
hjoin_shapes GAP SHAPESTRINGLIST
Join the shapes specified by SHAPESTRINGLIST horizontally with GAP spaces between each shape .
pour_text SHAPESTRING TEXTSTRING GAP FILLTEXT
Given a shape string SHAPESTRING , a string TEXTSTRING , and a GAP between successive shapes , returns a properly shaped string .
That is , pour TEXTSTRING into SHAPESTRING .
FILLTEXT ( typically ' # ' ) is text to be used as a filler for any leftover part of the shape ( if not set , do n't fill in leftovers ) .
pour_sightly SHAPESTRING PROGSTRING GAP RFILLVAR COMPACT IH
Given a shape string SHAPESTRING , a sightly - encoded program string PROGSTRING , and a GAP between successive shapes , returns a properly shaped program string .
That is , pour PROGSTRING into SHAPESTRING .
RFILLVAR is either a reference to an array of filler variables or , alternatively , a string to fill the leftover of the last shape with .
Common filler strings are '' for no filler at all , or ' # ' or ' ; ' or ' ; # ' .
A filler variable is a valid Perl variable consisting of two characters : $ and a punctuation character .
For example , RFILLVAR = [ '$ :' , ' $ ^ ' , '$ ~ ' ] .
Do not use $ ; or $ " or $ _ as filler variables .
If COMPACT is 1 , use compact sightly encoding , if 0 use plain sightly encoding .
If IH ( inform handler ) is undef , prints status of what it is doing to STDERR ; you can override this by providing a subroutine reference taking a single inform string argument .
To shut it up , set IH to sub {} .
sightly HASHREF Given a hash reference , HASHREF , describing various attributes , returns a properly shaped program string .
There is no error return ; if something is badly wrong , die is called -- so wrap the call to sightly in an eval block if you can't afford to die .
The attributes that HASHREF may contain are : Shape Describes the shape you want .
First , a built - in shape is looked for .
Next , a ' eye ' shape ( . eye file in the get_eye_dir ( ) directory unless overridden by the EyeDir attribute ) is looked for .
Finally , a file name is looked for .
ShapeString Describes the shape you want .
This time you specify a shape string .
SourceFile
The source file name to convert .
SourceHandle Specify a file handle instead of a file name .
SourceString Specify a string instead of a file name .
BannerString String to use with built - in Shape ' banner ' .
Regex Regex can take the following values : 0 : do not embed source program in a regex
If Regex is positive , embed the program in a regex and : 1 : add a leading " use re ' eval ' ; " for Perl 5.18 + only 2 : do not add a leading " use re ' eval ' ; " 3 : add a leading " use re ' eval ' ; "
Do not set this flag when converting complex programs .
Compact Boolean .
If set , use compact sightly encoding .
Print Boolean .
If set , use a print statement instead of the default eval statement .
Set this flag when converting text files ( not programs ) .
Binary Boolean .
Set if encoding a binary file .
Text Boolean .
Set if pouring unsightly text .
TextFiller Filler string used with Text attribute .
For example , TextFiller => ' # '.
Gap
The number of lines between successive shapes .
Rotate Rotate the shape clockwise 90 , 180 or 270 degrees .
RotateType 0 = big rotated shape , 1 = small rotated shape , 2 = squashed rotated shape .
RotateFlip Boolean .
Set if want to flip ( reflect ) the shape in addition to rotating it .
Reflect Boolean .
Reflect the shape .
Reduce Reduce the size of the shape .
Expand Expand the size of the shape .
Invert Boolean .
Invert the shape .
Indent Indent the shape .
The number of spaces to indent .
TrailingSpaces Boolean .
Ensure all lines of the shape are of equal length , adding trailing spaces if required .
RemoveNewlines Boolean .
Remove all newlines from the source before conversion .
BorderGap
Put a border around the shape .
Gap between border and the shape .
BorderGapLeft,BorderGapRight , BorderGapTop, BorderGapBottom
You can override BorderGap with one or more from the above .
BorderWidth
Put a border around the shape .
Width of border .
BorderWidthLeft,BorderWidthRight , BorderWidthTop, BorderWidthBottom
You can override BorderWidth with one or more from the above .
Width Ignored for .eye file shapes .
For built - in shapes , interpreted appropriately for the shape , typically the shape width in characters .
If no shape is specified , a rectangular block of Width characters is generated .
EyeDir Normally .eye files are got from the EyeDrops directory underneath where EyeDrops.pm is located .
You can override that by specifying a directory containing the .eye shape files .
InformHandler
By default , sightly prints status of what it is doing to STDERR ; you can override this by providing a subroutine reference taking a single inform string argument .
To shut it up , set to sub {} .
TrapEvalDie Boolean .
Add closing ' die $ @ if $ @ ' to generated program .
When an eval code block calls the die function , the program does not die ; instead the die string is returned to eval in $ @ .
Using this flag allows you to convert programs that call die .
TrapWarn Boolean .
Add leading ' local $ SIG{__WARN__}=sub{} ; ' to generated program .
This shuts up some warnings .
Use this option if generated program emits ' No such signal : SIGHUP at ...' when run with warnings enabled .
FillerVar Reference to a list of ' filler variables ' .
A filler variable is a Perl variable consisting of two characters : $ and a punctuation character .
For example , FillerVar => [ '$ :' , ' $ ^ ' ] .
Do not use $ ; or $ " or $ _ as filler variables .
Alternatively , you may set this to '' if you do n't want any filler , or to a string ( e.g. ' # ' or ' ; ' or ' ; # ' ) to use instead of filler variables to fill the leftover part of the last shape with .
Specifying a Shape
When you specify a shape like this :
sightly ( { Shape => ' fred ' ...
first a built - in fred shape is looked for , then EyeDrops looks for the file fred .
eye in the get_eye_dir directory .
If you specify a ' / ' or '. ' in the Shape attribute , a file with that name is looked for instead , for example :
sightly ( { Shape => '/tmp/fred.eye' ...
Finally , you may specify a shape with a string , for example :
my $ shapestr = <<' FLAMING_OSTRICHES '; ##### #######################
FLAMING_OSTRICHES sightly ( { ShapeString => $ shapestr ...
If you specify a shape without a source file :
print sightly ( { Shape => ' camel ' } ) ;
a no -op filler is used to fill the shape .
If you specify a source file without a shape :
print sightly ( { SourceFile => ' helloworld.pl ' } ) ;
a shapeless sightly string without any spaces or newlines is generated .
You can break this string into fixed width lines via the Width attribute :
print sightly ( { SourceFile => ' helloworld.pl ' , Width => 40 } ) ;
Generally , you should specify the Width attribute of built - in shapes .
Notice that the Width attribute is ignored for .eye file shapes .
Shape Reference
The built - in shapes are :
banner Linux banner command ( / usr / games / banner -w Width ) of text in BannerString attribute srcbanner Linux banner command ( / usr / games / banner -w Width ) of source text siertri A Sierpinski triangle ( 2** Width lines ) triangle A triangle ( width Width characters ) all A shape consisting of all .eye shapes joined together ( Width blank lines between each shape )

It is easy to create your own shapes .
For some ideas on shapes , point your search engine at Ascii Art or Clip Art .
If you generate some nice shapes , please send them in so they can be included in future versions of EyeDrops .
Shape Properties
All the .eye shape files have a corresponding .eyp shape property file , specifying the shape 's properties .
Currently , the allowed shape properties are :
name nick description cpanid author authorcpanid source keywords
where valid keywords are :
face person perlhacker animal object planet map flag sport underwear hbanner vbanner logo debian opera
To give an example of how shape properties might be used , to find all shapes that depict just the faces of perl hackers :
use Acme:: EyeDrops qw( find_eye_shapes ) ; my @perlhackers = find_eye_shapes ( ' face ' , ' person ' , ' perlhacker ' ) ;
Note that there is an implicit AND between each keyword ; that is , the above code finds all shapes with face AND person AND perlhacker keywords .
Additionally , you may use OR in any argument , for example :
my @perlhackers = find_eye_shapes ( ' face ' , ' person OR animal ' , ' perlhacker ' ) ;
finds all shapes matching face AND ( person OR animal ) AND perlhacker .
Instead of using the API , as shown above , you may also use the findshapes.pl command in the demo directory :
findshapes.pl -h ( for help ) findshapes.pl - v face person perlhacker
The last example displays the faces and properties of all perl hackers .
Please note that these shape properties are experimental and may change in future A : : E releases .
BUGS
A really diabolical shape with lots of single character lines will defeat the shape - pouring algorithm .
You can eliminate all alphanumerics ( via Regex => 1 ) only if the program to be converted is careful with its use of regular expressions and $ _ .
To convert complex programs , you must use Regex => 0 , which emits a leading unsightly double eval .
The code generated by non-zero Regex requires Perl 5.005 or higher in order to run ; when run on earlier versions , you will likely see the error message : Sequence ( ?{...) not recognized .
If using Perl 5.18 + , the generated file needs a leading " use re ' eval ' " when a postive value for Regex is used .
The converted program runs inside an eval which may cause problems for non-trivial programs .
A die statement or an INIT block , for instance , may cause trouble .
If desperate , give the TrapEvalDie and TrapWarn attributes a go , and see if they fix the problem .
If the program to be converted uses the Perl format variables $ : , $ ~ or $ ^ you may need to explicitly set the FillerVar attribute to a Perl variable /s not used by the program .
Linux /usr / games / banner does not support the following characters :
\ [ ] { } < > ^ _ | ~
When the CPAN Text : : Banner module is enhanced , it will be used in place of the Linux banner command .

Manufacturing Reality Jan 17 , 2006 The Omarosa Experiment
I met Omarosa before she was Omarosa .
It was a brief encounter in October 2003 on the stoop of a brownstone in Brooklyn .
NBC’s
The Apprentice was being filmed in the apartment above mine , and I was heading up the stairs to complain about the noise and disruption .
Omarosa passed me going the other direction , almost skipping down the steps , oblivious to my existence .
“ Are you the producer ? ” I asked .
Her quick glance , a withering , beauty queen smirk , packed more disdain pound for pound than anything I ’ve experienced since high school .
“ No , ” she mocked , “ I am not the producer . ”
By the time I found the producer , my boiling anger was intensified by several degrees ; Omarosa had helped catalyze an emotional reaction that made for combustible drama .
Five months later , The Apprentice was a ratings hit and Omarosa Manigault - Stallworth ( known , like Cher , Beck , Prince , and Madonna , by her first name ) was a reality TV phenomenon , a person who transcended individual personality to become that holy grail of entertainment — a break - out character .
Along with 20 million other television viewers , I could n’t help but watch the show , occasionally entertained while also feeling cynical about the “ reality of it all . ”
In my mind , reality TV was guilty of distorting human personality by putting people together in artificial situations to produce explosive social dynamics , and , when that failed , drastically editing scenes , dialogue , and situations to get the desired results .
I was surprised , however , to see how closely the woman I now knew as Omarosa adhered to my brief experience of her in real life .
She had been “ in character ” even off camera with me on the stoop .
Rather than distorting her personality , it was as though reality TV had captured it in pure form .
How the hell did it manage that ?
Sam I Am
When I spoke with Omarosa on the telephone for this article , two and a half years later , I developed a more nuanced impression of her , one that I ’ll describe before this story is through .
I told Omarosa that I was interested in how reality television chooses its contestants .
What is the process people go through to get on a show ?
How had producers discovered her , arguably the most well - known reality TV contestant of all time ?
Did the producers distort people ’s characters to get what they wanted ?
Though Omarosa agreed there was a very interesting story to be told , she was n’t free to go into the details .
She ’d signed a three - year non-disclosure agreement that was in effect for another seven months .
“ Mark Burnett [ producer of The Apprentice ] scrutinizes everything I say and do in the press , ” she told me .
We could talk , but I ’d have to rely on others to get any inside information on how people were selected .
Omarosa was one of 16 candidates chosen out of a reported 250,000 applicants for the first season of The Apprentice .
Sam Solovey was another .
We talked on the phone about his experience ; he was less worried about the non-disclosure agreement .
The day The Apprentice did an open casting call in Washington , D.C. , Solovey decided to audition .
Though he believed the contestants were often hired actors , he was intrigued enough by the contest to roll out of bed and give it a shot .
The casting call billed the show as Survivor set in the Manhattan business world .
Solovey , who had been making money in various business ventures since his teens and had the drive and energy of a salesman , figured he would do well in the competition .
According to Solovey , the audition line stretched around the corner of the building and down the block .
Sweating in the sun , most of the hopefuls wore suits and looked very serious about their business credentials .
Solovey had n’t even shaved but he figured that anyone who was willing to wait in line that long to get on a show geared toward business success did n’t have much going on .
If he went to the back of the line , it would be hours before his turn came .
Aiming to distinguish himself one way or the other , Solovey waltzed to the front and offered a guy $ 50 to let him walk into the casting with him .
Ten minutes later , Solovey was sitting around a table with a group of applicants fielding questions from the casting people .
The first topic of discussion was business ethics .
Solovey put up his hand .
“ Here ’s one for you .
I just paid this guy 50 bucks to walk in .
You ’ve all been waiting for four hours .
Is that ethical ? ”
The other applicants were furious , but Solovey was called back for the next round of auditions .
Over the ensuing weeks , as the casting process winnowed 250,000 applicants to 50 finalists secluded in a San Francisco hotel , Solovey went from having no interest in reality TV to being consumed by it .
“ I ’d do anything to be on the show , ” he said .
“ That ’s my personality .
If something engages me , I go 150 percent . ”
When he reached the final cut , the producers said he was n’t going to make it ; they could n’t type - cast him easily enough .
As Solovey recalls it , Burnett , who ’d already created the mega - hit Survivor , demanded , “ Why should I hire you ? ” Solovey let it all out .
“ You have all these beautiful women with fake chests .
You have all these men who are big athletes , and you ’ve got me .
Sam I am . ”
He got in Burnett ’s face .
“ Sam I fucking am . ”
He got the job .
Enter the Maze
Once applicants make it to the round of finalists , the exact process by which they are selected for a reality show gets murky .
As Omarosa indicated , contestants sign hefty non-disclosure agreements limiting what they can talk about .
In addition , it also seems as though the applicants themselves are deliberately left in the dark about what is actually going on .
Secluded in hotel rooms , they are told not to talk to anyone .
Contestants are n’t sure what stage of the application process they have reached or who else is in the running .
From a competition standpoint , this has some merit , since it ’s important that contestants have no information about each other before meeting on the show .
But the isolation and uncertainty are also a taste of what ’s to come ; reality is being manufactured for them and their lives are no longer under their own control .
They ’ve become lab rats in a television production maze .
They know they are being watched , and that they have to be in character and at high voltage — all the time .
“ These are the people who can go on TV and be publicly humiliated and see it as a good thing . ”
To get on Hell ’s Kitchen , Ralph Pagano did his first round of casting at Twins Talent , a New York - based casting agency , filming a two - minute piece about why he’d be well suited for the show .
As a tough - talking , wise - cracking New York Italian who wore gaudy clothes and happened to be a professional chef , Pagano knew he filled a certain niche .
He later told the producers , “ If you ’re typecasting for the Italian American , I ’m in .
I ’ll give you what you want . ”
After a round of phone interviews with other casting producers , he and 49 other finalists were flown to Los Angeles and sequestered in a hotel .
Over the next three days , Pagano says , he met with the producers for repeated interviews .
In between , he filled out questionnaires , met with doctors , got his blood taken , had his past probed , and spent an hour with a psychiatrist who tried to get inside his head .
“ They want to know if you ’re crazy , ” Pagano says , “ and if you are crazy , what kind — homicidal or just fun ? ”
Burton Roberts applied for the third season of Survivor after a friend suggested he submit an audition tape .
He never heard back .
A year later , at a party , he ran into a casting agent who asked if he’d be interested in trying out for Survivor : Pearl Islands .
As a former Eagle Scout , an MBA who had worked in start - up companies , and an experienced adventurer who ’d already competed on the 2002 Eco - Challenge in Fiji , Roberts was a Tarzan waiting for a loin cloth .
This time his audition was successful .
The producers called him back for further interviews , and he found himself in the final 50 .
For Roberts , there was a lot of luck in getting chosen — after all , he was only one applicant of many who filled a very common “ single , white , athletic male ” demographic .
But there was no mystery to how he got selected ; he just had to be himself and hope that the self he presented was more interesting than his competition .
“ If you try to B.S. your way through , you ’re going to get caught up in a lie , especially when you get to the personality testing . ”
The producers are looking for that authenticity because they believe it ’s impossible to fake who you are on camera during the course of a shoot , and they want to know exactly what they ’re getting before they let you on their show .
Omarosa likens the candidate - selection process to sausage - making — you enjoy the end product but you probably do n’t want to know what goes into the grinder .
“ If people knew how scientific it was , ” she says , “ so much so that they had three psychologists , not one , examine us , test us , scrutinize us .
Then we had a full - blown physical examination .
Let me repeat , ” she emphasizes , “ a full - blown physical examination . ”
The scrutiny also entailed a full - blown background check , which included her third - grade teacher and current employer .
“ They knew with great accuracy how a person was going to react in certain situations , ” Omarosa states .
“ They knew from my psychological evaluation that I had a problem with authority .
I do n’t bow down to anyone .
I ’m a natural leader , and I do n’t defer to anyone else ’s leadership .
So in a situation like The Apprentice , where every week a different person was project leader , they knew I would have no respect for that authority figure .
They anticipated how I would react with great accuracy . ”
The Doctor Will See You Now
The responsibility for determining how candidates will react and whether they are “ homicidal crazy or just fun crazy ” rests with psychologists .
For Survivor : Pearl Islands , Roberts was interviewed by two psychologists : Dr. Richard Levak and Dr. Liza Siegel .
The same two doctors also interviewed Omarosa and Solovey for The Apprentice .
Omarosa credits Levak with lobbying the producers to get her on the show .
“ From what I understand , he said to them that I had one of the most unique psychological profiles he ’d ever seen . ”
According to what Omarosa says Levak told her privately , this profile was an unusual combination of high intelligence and high social skills and a balanced mix of feminine and masculine qualities , elegance and poise countered by a ruthless , competitive drive .
Solovey was also fascinated by his personality assessment .
“ Levak nailed me right on the dot .
I remember him saying that I am the kind of person who will go all the way to the edge , and I have to be careful that I do n’t go over the edge . ”
Solovey acknowledges that while this tendency to go to extremes got him selected for the show , it ’s also why he lost .
And in the end , he believes it may be why the reality TV experience was so tough on him .
Levak is a psychologist and personality expert with a private practice in Del Mar , Calif .
Although he has recently stopped consulting for reality TV shows , Levak has been instrumental in reality TV casting over the last six years , working on every season of Survivor , The Amazing Race and The Apprentice in addition to The Contender ; three seasons of Big Brother ; and a number of smaller shows , including Cupid , Mister Romance , and the Fox presidential election show , The Candidate .
When he left Survivor after six seasons , he says , Mark Burnett awarded him the “ immunity idol ” as a parting gift .
Levak was asked to help cast the first Survivor because , he says , the producers were concerned about the possibility one of their contestants might commit suicide .
They had good reason to be wary : Survivor is the licensed American version of a 1997 Swedish reality TV show called Expedition Robinson .
Two months before that show premiered on television , the first contestant booted from the competition , 34 - year - old Sinisa Savija , stepped in front of a train .
His family claimed he was distraught over the intense experience of being rejected .
Levak ’s role in Survivor and the other shows was to screen the final group of applicants and make recommendations .
“ Together with another psychologist , I would meet the finalists in a secret location and they would be given a battery of tests — personality , [ standard ] intelligence , emotional intelligence , and so on — that would then allow me to give feedback to the producers about who are the interesting personalities , what are their make - ups , and how they are likely to behave on TV . ”
In other words , Levak identified those applicants who might be vulnerable to the contest and those who had “ big ” personalities , while making some basic predictions about how people would act on the show .
Levak formulates all of his assessment conclusions in layman ’s language in order to help the producers understand the dramatic possibilities in bringing certain people together on TV .
For contractual reasons , he ca n’t use specific examples from the reality TV shows he has worked on , but he offers theoretical samples .
“ Classic psychological mumbo jumbo might describe you as a passive - aggressive , oral , dependent personality .
But if I say that you ’re a person who ’s very preoccupied with how people see you and that you may go out of your way to please others , even at your own expense , the producers can see you as a peacemaker and conflict avoider , with a strong desire to avoid disapproval . ”
“ In my experience , ” Levak said , “ producers want the reality to speak for itself .
They do n’t want distortions .
They may choose to edit to highlight the personality , but if you ’re a quiet , withdrawn type , the producers wo n’t try to create something that is n’t there . ”
If you put 16 conflict - avoiders together on an island , Levak says , you wo n’t end up with very interesting TV .
On the other hand , if you compose a group entirely with aggressive , extroverted , Type A personalities , you may produce some fireworks , but it ’s unlikely you ’ll sustain an audience ’s attention over weeks .
Instead , the most compelling viewing comes when people with different yet recognizable personalities evolve over time in relation to those around them while dealing with competition and trying circumstances — crisis meeting characters to create drama .
While reality TV may not be Shakespeare , it ’s at its best when viewers are drawn in by the contestants ’ personalities and become invested in what will happen to them .
Levak defines the dramatic goal of reality TV as “ an interesting evolution of human dynamics that is entertaining but not dangerous or exploitive . ”
The possibility of reality TV ’s being exploitative gave him pause when he first considered working in the genre . “ When I told colleagues that I was going to be working on that kind of TV show [ Survivor ] , they thought I was crazy .
Yet I found it fascinating because I saw it as a social - psych experiment , something that ’s almost impossible to do now because the experiments might cause people emotional strife or discord .
I was given the chance to look at people ’s personalities and make predictions about their behavior and perhaps do some good in protecting someone from being put on the show who should n’t be . ”
Dr. Siegel , Levak ’s colleague , joined Survivor in the third season and has also worked on The Apprentice since its debut .
In addition to helping assess contestants ’ personalities before the competition , Siegel goes on - site to see to their mental well - being after they have been kicked out of the game .
Her two roles require different hats .
“ In the casting , I ’m screening them , scrutinizing them , and telling everything they tell me to the producers , ” she said .
“ [ The contestants are ] very aware of that , so there ’s no confidentiality issues .
But then , once I get there , I ’m in a very supportive role .
Suddenly , I ’m not thinking like a producer anymore , I ’m just thinking how I can best help these people who made it onto the show . ”
On both shows , after contestants are voted off or fired , they meet with Siegel on a regular basis while still quarantined .
According to Siegel , plenty of contestants have had extremely positive experiences and no regrets other than the fact that they did not win , but some have difficulty dealing with failure .
“ People can be very disappointed and hard on themselves , ” Siegel says .
“ They ’re looking for what went wrong , and kind of obsess about it for a while . ”
The two shows have some important differences in that regard .
On Survivor , the contestants experience what Siegel describes as “ social wounds ” because they feel hurt and betrayed by their fellow contestants .
In the debriefing sessions , booted contestants tend to talk at length about their relationships with family , close friends , and spouses , while also reflecting on changes they want to make in their lives .
On The Apprentice the wounds are more professional and public .
It ’s a blow to the ego to be fired by Donald Trump .
“ These are people who are passionate about business .
It ’s tough for them when it does n’t work out , and a lot of them thought this would propel them to a new level .
So they feel disappointed because they thought it would be huge . ”
As go - getters , they ’re ready for the next challenge , but they ’re concerned that it wo n’t be as exciting or opportunity - rich as the one they just went through .
Siegel believes that the contestants who are selected for the shows have an innate ability to be resilient about setbacks and a strong tendency to find positive outcomes after a difficult challenge .
“ Richard calls them super - normals , ” Siegel says .
Levak explains , “ I coined the term super - normal for a group of people who do not seem to cry over spilled milk . ”
Super - normals , he says , bounce back quickly and do n’t take slights personally .
They ’re resilient and capable of dealing with stress .
They ’re willing to put everything on the line but can overturn even great disappointment with relentless optimism .
As Levak puts it , “ These are the people who can go on TV and be publicly humiliated and see it as a good thing . ”
Siegel sometimes talks with contestants after the show is broadcast .
“ As the show airs , I watch it , and if I see something that looks like it ’s going to be hurtful , they ’ll call me or I ’ll reach out to them and say , ‘ How are you doing ? ’
I ’ll even do follow - up way after the show .
That ’s the part I love the most because they almost all come out with amazing opportunities . ”
She gave me a number of anecdotal examples of people on the various seasons of The Apprentice and Survivor who dealt with the adversity that arose from appearing on the show and turned it into a positive life change .
For the contestants I talked to , whether reality TV was a positive or negative experience had an awful lot to do with how fairly each felt he or she was used .
The Distortionists
The extensive testing and checking that goes into contestant selection reinforces the possibility that reality TV captures authentic character .
Yet people complain about distortion .
Recently , for example , a contestant “ fired ” from the 2005 season of The Apprentice sued Mark Burnett and NBC for the way he was portrayed on the show .
I asked Richard Levak if reality TV shows were n’t highly manufactured soap operas .
“ In my experience , ” Levak said , “ producers want the reality to speak for itself .
They do n’t want distortions .
They may choose to edit to highlight the personality , but if you ’re a quiet , withdrawn type , the producers wo n’t try to create something that is n’t there . ”
The contestants I talked to acknowledged trepidation .
Pagano went onto
Hell ’s Kitchen with the risk of distortion in mind but determined to let the chips fall where they would .
“ When the camera ’s on 24 hours a day … you tend to forget or let your guard down . ”
Though he says negative personal emails and comments in chat rooms angered him , in the end , he feels the show was accurate and fair .
He also finished second place , gained fame in the Hamptons , where he runs his catering business , and recently shot a pilot for The Food Network .
“ Distortion is one of the risks you take , ” Roberts says .
“ These shows have hundreds of hours of footage that get boiled down .
I might be the funniest guy in the world , but if it does n’t impact the game it may not make sense to show it . ”
While Roberts feels that editing showed a more narrow band of his personality than normal , it also managed to capture that part of him .
“ My strategy in the first week was to lay low , to not stand out , and to try not to be a leader under any circumstances .
That lasted a whole six hours . ”
Though most of the contestants were new to roughing it , Roberts had highly developed survival skills and he found it impossible to watch someone struggle to build a fire and not step in to help .
This behavior got labeled arrogant and even misogynist by fellow contestants and viewers commenting in chat rooms .
“ At the end of the day , you ’re pretty much who you are , and that will come out , ” he says .
For Roberts , like Pagano , the experience was a highly positive one .
In addition to having the time of his life on the show , he reassessed his career path and capitalized on his B - level fame by establishing a travel company that tries to recreate the experience of Survivor .
“ Where you get pushed over the edge is not during the show , it ’s afterwards .
You do n’t know what you ’re getting into .
I would not have done this if I had known what would happen afterwards . ”
Omarosa ’s view of her own experience is telling .
“ I ’ve never hidden my feelings about the show , ” she laughs .
“ I ’m very honored to have been selected and it changed my life .
However , there is a reality behind reality television , and that reality is that it ’s not real … .
I can tell you that what I watched and what I lived through are two different things . ”
While she wo n’t go into specifics , Omarosa fingers the editing process as the means by which this distortion was created .
“ If I taped you over three days and I had the discretion of choosing whatever I wanted , I could paint you in any light I wanted . ”
At the same time , however , Omarosa says her cold and calculating behavior on the show was coldly calculated , a comment that brings to mind Levak ’s reported description of her as charming but ruthless .
Omarosa states , “ I made a conscious decision not to establish relationships with [ my fellow contestants ] during the taping … because I thought it would cloud my judgment .
I looked at The Apprentice as an FCC - regulated game show , and I went into it looking at it as a game . ”
She knew she could n’t get attached to someone personally and then hesitate to eliminate them in competition .
“ I genuinely like [ fellow contestant ] Kristi Frank but I took her out in the boardroom in probably the worst firing you ’ll ever see .
I devoured her in the boardroom .
I genuinely liked her , and I was genuinely sad when she left the suite .
The suite was very empty without her , but what are you going to do ?
It ’s a competitive show .
If it was n’t her , it would be me . ”
During the shooting , she says , she was surprised that the others did n’t behave this way and instead internalized the interpersonal friction of competition .
When I mention that she seemed better able to compartmentalize than most people , she acknowledges misgivings .
“ I paid a very dear price for that .
On the show I came across as very cold and distant . ”
Although she admits to being cold and distant as a strategy , she still objects to the way the producers portrayed that as being her entire personality .
“ There ’s so many different levels to all of us .
We have a business side and a personal side .
We have a side that we ’re like with our families and a side that we ’re like with our college buddies , and they only showed one side of me .
Yes , I ’m very competitive .
But I ’m only competitive in competitive environments .
Take me out of that and I ’m a little puddy cat . ”
Perhaps not a puddy cat , but I felt she had a point .
The Omarosa I talked to was n’t haughty , cold , and disdainful like the one who ’d walked my stoop as if it were a red carpet .
She was polite , friendly , generous with her thoughts and feelings , articulate , and insightful — with a cutting intelligence , some reflexive contrarian tendencies , lots of easy poise , and an immense self - confidence lurking below the humble surface .
She was n’t the infamous bitch that she ’d been portrayed as on TV , but I had no illusions that she ’d be a pushover in a friendly tennis match or Monopoly game .
Describing her fame - driven life post - Apprentice , she still seemed imperial , a pop-culture diva of marketing and self - promotion — but so what ?
These crimes hardly warranted so much notoriety and a public - spoofing on Saturday Night Live .
I felt for her in the sense that she ’d been branded so thoroughly .
But it also seemed as though she ’d given reality TV all the fuel it needed to ignite the flames and had taken her brand and marketed it to the hilt — trademarking her name , appearing on Fear Factor and the Battle of the Reality All - Stars , and pitching a tell - all book .
Omarosa described herself as going through three distinct emotional phases after The Apprentice aired .
The first phase was shock at the distortion of how she ’d been edited .
“ I could n’t believe I could say one comment and it would be followed with another [ comment made much later that reinforced the impression . ] ”
The second phase was acceptance .
“ OK , ” she found herself realizing , “ this is the reality America knows .
It ’s not what I lived through , but 30 million people now believe this to be true , so I have to react to how they presented it , not what actually happened . ”
And the third phase , in the parlance of motivational self - help , was action .
“ Now that I ’ve been characterized as the biggest villain in reality TV history , what do you do about that , how do you market it , how do you capitalize on it , how do you exploit it ?
So I sprang into action .
OK , you want to see naughty girl , I ’ll give you naughty girl .
And America and Hollywood loves a bad girl .
When I go into meetings and if I ’m not in bad girl mode , in character , they ’re disappointed .
They ’re like , ‘ Ah , man .
She ’s nice .
It ’s boring . ’“
Showing no regrets , Omarosa adds , “ If [ reality TV ] ended tomorrow , I will tell you very honestly that I did it to the fullest and rode the wave more than anybody . ”
Super - normal , indeed .
After the Fall
Even someone as resilient as Omarosa had difficulties adjusting to post - reality - TV life .
“ There was paranoia , ” she says .
“ When I walk into rooms , I check for cameras .
I wonder if there ’s a listening device .
I do n’t think I had any traumatic psychological consequences , but there have been people who have , and that ’s the other side of it .
During the height of The Apprentice , we were the it kids .
We could go where we wanted to go .
People are interested in you , and then they move on .
I ’ve talked to people who have problems with that .
It ’s almost like surviving a tornado and going back and picking up the pieces of your life . ”
If there was a range of positive and negative experiences I encountered , Sam Solovey ’s was the low end .
In our conversation , he was just as intelligent , articulate , and thoughtful as Omarosa , but he was also deeply candid about the emotional tolls .
Solovey was fired from The Apprentice on the third episode .
He describes the experience of competing on the show as a disaster .
“ It was very stressful .
I was n’t sleeping .
I was n’t eating .
They did n’t want you sleeping and eating because they want the extremes of your personality to come out . ”
Famously , Solovey fell asleep during one scene waiting for his teammates to complete a task .
Some of Solovey ’s behavior seemed bizarre to the other contestants , Donald Trump , and the viewers , though he says it made sense to him at the time .
Returning from the board room on the second episode , he became upset that none of his teammates greeted his return , so he sat outside the door of the room for an hour and would not enter until someone came over to him .
“ I was making a point that no one cared about me , everyone was so consumed with themselves . ”
Brought back for the final episode , Solovey tried to buy a job from Trump , offering to pay him a half million dollars .
Trump turned him down .
Levak ’s predictions about Solovey had come true .
He was capable of going over the edge .
Solovey says , “ People accused me of playing to the cameras , but I do n’t think I did .
I think the cameras draw the extremes of your personality out .
If you ’re shy , the cameras make you more shy .
If you ’re someone who loves an audience , they push you in that direction . ”
The pressure Solovey felt on the show was very real .
“ I do believe I was one of the most intense people there .
I forgot where I was .
I forgot I was even in New York City .
I ’d call my girlfriend at odd hours and she did n’t know what I was talking about , like I was delusional .
They were taping the conversations .
I would try to talk in code and I ’d say these off - the - wall things and she thought I ’d lost my mind .
Troy , my roommate , would try to calm me down . ”
But if this was difficult for Solovey , it made for great TV .
Unfortunately the most trying part of the competition came later , after the cameras had stopped rolling .
“ Where you get pushed over the edge is not during the show , it ’s afterwards .
You do n’t know what you ’re getting into .
I would not have done this if I had known what would happen afterwards .
They do n’t tell you how it ’s going to affect you psychologically after the show .
The down .
I do n’t even know if they know . ”
Solovey was the first break - out character on The Apprentice to be fired .
After the show aired , his life changed .
“ I remember how bizarre it was when I went with my friend to get breakfast the next morning , people coming up and shaking my hand .
I had no concept of what it was like to be recognized .
It ’s very strange and you do n’t know what it ’s going to be like until it happens . ”
He got swept up in the fame and publicity , participating eagerly even as he felt it taking control .
He asked his girlfriend to marry him on The Today Show .
He appeared on Oprah .
The opportunities to appear on TV and before groups of people were seductive and even addictive , always leaving him craving the next big high .
But even while it paid off financially and provided tantalizing chances for more fame , he came to believe that “ really , you ’re basically a product of NBC and Mark Burnett , promoting the show . ”
For someone exposing such vulnerability , Solovey did n’t sound bitter .
Rather , he seemed dry-eyed and almost curious about the impact fame had on him , even if he was pained by the costs .
“ I had no issue with the way I was portrayed , never made any excuses .
I laughed with it .
I did n’t care about the negative comments made about me ; there were a lot of positive ones , too .
My negatives were n’t about that .
It was about how the whole experience has affected me afterwards . ”
He parted ways with his business partner .
He began to experience difficult mood swings .
“ It ’s changed my orientation about the purpose of my life .
I have n’t really been satisfied professionally since the day I went on that show .
I have fears that I never will be .
I used to be motivated by the opportunities that wealth brought , and I ’m now kind of disgusted by it .
There was so much I discovered through the fame thing .
How empty it is . ”
When I mentioned to Omarosa that Solovey expressed such misgivings , and felt as though he had been turned into a commodity by the producers , she was moved by his troubles but countered : “ I would n’t empower someone to treat me like a commodity .
Sure , Mark Burnett did the editing , and America saw what it saw , but I marketed and packaged the character that ’s become Omarosa .
I would n’t hand that ownership over to Mark Burnett .
With Sam , it ’s true , they used him for what he was worth , and like any commodity , it has a certain value at a certain time , and you buy low and sell high .
But for me , I had to take what they presented and mold and shape it .
There ’s a saying , good girls go to heaven , bad girls go absolutely everywhere , and I ’m going everywhere .
That ’s not determined by NBC , Mark Burnett , or Donald Trump , that ’s going to be determined by me . ”
Solovey , on the other hand , cites Omarosa as someone who is still in character , long after the show has ended , because her personality has become her marketable brand .
“ I do n’t know if she chose it or it chose her , because it ’s a sickness .
What is she going to do now to get that kind of attention , even though it ’s negative ?
She is content building this character she manufactured that is essentially as people saw her on the show .
She ’s still on the drug , and nothing she ’s doing is going to be like The Apprentice .
She ’s slowly , slowly coming down . ”
Reality Bites
Given the line - ups at casting calls and the popularity of the shows , it seems as though contestants will continue to go on reality TV eagerly .
Once they make it to the round of finalists , they willingly sign hefty contracts absolving the production companies of liabilities and submit to background checks , physical tests , grueling interviews , and psychological probing .
Many , apparently , have a positive experience .
Meanwhile , the producers , if only out of self - interest , take great pains to keep vulnerable people from participating .
But they are also in the business of forcing contestants into risky situations .
No matter how optimistic or resilient people might seem at the outset , the consequences of such risks may not always be predictable .
Sometimes those risks are physical .
In September 2004 , 38 - year - old Australian Nigel Aylott died when a fallen boulder struck his head while he was competing in Subaru Primal Quest , a kind of extreme Eco - Challenge for professional adventurers that , though not a reality show itself , was later broadcast on CBS ; in September 2005 , there were reports of a serious injury to a contestant on a reality TV show pilot called The Ultimate Ultimate Challenge .
Billed as a brutal combination of Survivor , Fear Factor , and Eco-Challenge , the show was produced by Kevin Blatt — the pornographer most famous for releasing the Paris Hilton sex video — but has yet to air or be picked up by a network .
In other cases , the risks are more psychological .
On Feb. 14 , 2005 , 22 - year - old Philadelphia boxer Najai “ Nitro ” Turpin , a contestant on NBC ’s boxing show The Contender , hosted by Sylvester Stallone and produced by Mark Burnett , shot himself in the head .
In May 2005 , a 17 - year - old British girl , Carina Stephenson , killed herself six months after she and her family participated as contestants in The Colony , a History Channel production filmed in Australia ; her family did n’t publicly blame the show .
In August 2005 , Danny Bonaduce , childhood star of the Partridge Family , slit his wrists , distraught over the emotional pressures he felt undergoing public marriage counseling on VH1 ’s reality TV show , Breaking Bonaduce ; he survived .
And in September 2005 , the sister of an Extreme Makeover hopeful took her life with a mix of pills and alcohol , the family attributing her suicide to bad feelings stemming from the show .
Dr. Levak was involved in screening for The Contender .
Turpin ’s suicide almost a year later upset Levak deeply .
Although he did n’t want to speculate in - depth , he did surmise that the fact that Turpin killed himself on Valentine ’s Day in front of his girlfriend suggests his emotional troubles could not be attributed solely to his participation on a reality TV show .
Should the screening process have unearthed this potential vulnerability ?
Levak found professional boxers as a breed to be a surprisingly introverted and passive group .
“ I thought they ’d be aggressive pit bulls , but they were very disciplined and insular and self - contained …
Many of them had very difficult stories , and they ’ve done amazing things with their lives .
So if you were trying to choose 12 or 16 who are the picture of mental health , you just would n’t find any .
They all had issues , but they were all remarkable people . ”
The assessment of an individual ’s character does not allow the producers to make perfect predictions about how they will react to the circumstances of the show .
As Siegel puts it , “ We just white - knuckle it until the show is over .
It ’s harder for Richard than me because I ’m here [ on site ] and I know that I ’m doing everything I can for them , so I feel OK about that .
If I was just casting them and turning them over , I would feel more nervous . ”
In fact , both Omarosa and Solovey mentioned that the help Siegel provided them in dealing with their experiences was very valuable .
Emotional breakdowns , physical injuries , and suicides occur in the real world , of course .
But when these traumas happen in the context of an “ FCC - regulated game , ” they are more difficult to accept .
Maybe , as Solovey believes , the producers are not as aware of the downturn that occurs after the show is over .
As Omarosa puts it , “ When a person leaves that controlled environment and they have to go home and cope with what they ’ve experienced , the producers have no more control . ”
She likens the experience of competing on reality TV to the infamous Stanford Prison Experiment conducted in 1971 .
“ It ’s really stunning , ” she says , “ how many similarities there are between that experiment and the Burnett shows . ”
Of course , Philip Zimbardo ’s experiment , in which 21 normal college students were randomly assigned to be prisoners or guards in a mock prison , was stopped after only six days because the abuse and trauma generated by the situation got out of hand so quickly .
Despite the precautions producers take today , no reality show can be perfectly safe , because reality can never be fully controlled .
Still , the algorithm of ratings holds a cold logic .
If reality television is a kind of social psychology experiment conducted for our entertainment , then as the stakes grow and shows continue to push the envelope , greater risks will be taken and contestants will be put into more emotionally combustible or physically challenging situations .
Zimbardo ’s experiment taught us how something like Abu Ghraib could happen today .
What is reality TV teaching us now ?

Failing to give babies cuddles and affection subtly changes how their brains develop , and in later life can leave them anxious and poor at forming relationships .
Love and affection from parents and carers are vital to developing the brain " pathways " involved in dealing with stress and forming social bonds , according to a study published yesterday .
Seth Pollak , a psychologist at the University of Wisconsin , led a research team that compared the progress of children raised by their biological parents with children who had come from crowded orphanages in Russia and Romania and had been adopted by parents in the US .

Simplified Language for Embedded Compilation
1. Introduction
In the development of embedded systems , there is a need to understand multiple CPU architectures and to be able to use dedicated development environments .
This situation gives rise to concerns that long term maintenance , including maintenance of the development environment itself , could become very difficult as the environment evolves over time .
In fact , such maintenance problems have already been observed .
For example , finding compatible CPU ’s for ten year old FA systems is very difficult .
Reconstruction of the environment to generate the same object code has become almost impossible .
In cross development , it is foreseen that reconstruction of older development environments will become increasingly more difficult because manufacturers continually update integrated environments and operating systems as improvements are made in them .
In addressing these concerns , I have developed a technique to embed compilers into systems equipped with microprocessors .
This will provide for minimum maintenance in the long term when effecting repairs or functional enhancements .
Photo 1 : Example Implementation of the ForCy
2. Virtualization of CPU Architectures
CPU ’s implemented with intermediate code interpreters can be operated as virtual stack machines .
One CPU can easily be replaced by another CPU equipped with the same interpreter .
With the increased processing power of recent low - end microcontrollers , some decrease in processing efficiency may be acceptable for many applications .
Figure 1 : Built - in Compiler and Virtual Stack Machine
3. Embedded Language Processors
Microcomputers embedded with source programs and language processors require only text editors and a user interface in order to repair or replace code .
Source code is internally encoded into intermediate code during the transfer from the host PC .
Alternately , the source code can be embedded into the compiling device before compilation .
The intermediate code is stored in programmable flash memory or EEPROM’s .
Abstract of the ForCy system ( pdf 191KB )
4. Reducing the Overall Bulk of Compilers
The language specification has been written to reduce the code bulk of the compiler .
It is reduced to be compatible with the limited amount of memory ( in the range of several kilobytes ) available to low - end microcomputers .
In addition , the language offers low implementation cost and high scalability through modifications and simplification allowing improved program flow .
ForCy is a programming language in a postfix notation similar to the C language with PostScript syntax .
It generates intermediate code for virtual stack machines .
This compiler can handle three data types , such as 16 - bit unsigned integers , arrays and strings .
Pointer operations are prohibited , and tail callings are optimized to reduce stack consumption .
The main process of code generation is identification of words and assignment of byte codes in virtually one - to - one correspondence .
A parser counts the length of { } blocks and generates code to be disregarded .
Due to the small RAM capacity , the one - pass processing is designed to compile into self - programmable flash memory while receiving source text through a serial communications interface .

’ %c // CR - LF ++ =y } do .
: multiply 1 > { dup -- self * } if : factorial
List 1 : Example of ForCy Program Code
The interpreter sequentially calls processes depending on intermediate codes to operate the data stack and the return stack .
The compiler itself is also encoded into intermediate codes and operates on the interpreter .
The entire language processors including compilers and interpreters can be implemented in 4 to 6 kilobytes of code .
Figure 2 : Memory usage of PIC16F88
5. Implementation
This simplified language was implemented using a Microchip PIC16F88 ( 4 K word ROM and 368 byte RAM ) .
It sequentially compiles program text transmitted through a RS - 232C interface .
It then writes the results into a flash memory area and interprets it .
Although the PIC architecture is not adequate for a stack machine , it can calculate the first 100 digits of the value of Pi in 8 seconds using a 20 MHZ clock .
This language is also implemented with a PIC12F683 , R8C / Tiny and ATmega88 .
An interrupt mechanism is available in R8C / Tiny and ATmega88 .
Thus it can easily activate tasks at regular intervals and process multiple tasks in quasi- parallel fashion .

American troops in Baghdad yesterday blasted their way into the home of an Iraqi journalist working for the Guardian and Channel 4 , firing bullets into the bedroom where he was sleeping with his wife and children .
Ali Fadhil , who two months ago won the Foreign Press Association young journalist of the year award , was hooded and taken for questioning .
He was released hours later .
Dr Fadhil is working with Guardian Films on an investigation for Channel 4's Dispatches programme into claims that tens of millions of dollars worth of Iraqi funds held by the Americans and British have been misused or misappropriated .
The troops told Dr Fadhil that they were looking for an Iraqi insurgent and seized video tapes he had shot for the programme .
These have not yet been returned .
The director of the film , Callum Macrae , said yesterday : " The timing and nature of this raid is extremely disturbing .
It is only a few days since we first approached the US authorities and told them Ali was doing this investigation , and asked them then to grant him an interview about our findings .
" We need a convincing assurance from the American authorities that this terrifying experience was not harassment and a crude attempt to discourage Ali's investigation . "
Dr Fadhil was asleep with his wife , their three - year - old daughter , Sarah , and seven - month - old son , Adam , when the troops forced their way in .
" They fired into the bedroom where we were sleeping , then three soldiers came in .
They rolled me on to the floor and tied my hands .
When I tried to ask them what they were looking for they just told me to shut up , " he said .
Blogs are sometimes shut down altogether , temporarily or permanently .
But the authorities do not yet seem to have an answer to the proliferation of public opinion in this form .
The new wave of blogging took off earlier this year .
In the past , a few pioneers of the form stood out , but now huge communities of bloggers are springing up around the country , with many of them promoting one another 's online offerings , books , music or , as in Mu Mu's case , a running , highly ironic commentary about sexuality , intellect and political identity .
" The new bloggers are talking back to authority , but in a humorous way , " said Xiao Qiang , director of the China Internet Project at the University of California , Berkeley .
" People have often said you can say anything you want in China around the dinner table , but not in public .
Now the blogs have become the dinner table , and that is new .
" The content is often political , but not directly political , in the sense that you are not advocating anything , but at the same time you are undermining the ideological basis of power . "
A fresh example was served up last week with the announcement by China of five cartoonlike mascot figures for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing .
They were lavishly praised in the press -- and widely ridiculed in blogs that seemed to accurately express public sentiment toward them .
" It 's not difficult to create a mascot that 's silly and ugly , " wrote one blogger .
" The difficulty is in creating five mascots , each sillier and uglier than the one before it . "
A leading practitioner of the sly , satirical style that is emerging here as an influential form of political and social commentary is a 38 - year - old Beijing entertainment journalist named Wang Xiaofeng .
Mr. Wang , who runs a site called Massage Milk , is better known to bloggers by his nickname , Dai San Ge Biao , which means Wears Three Watches .

In his 1850 Disquisition on Government , John C. Calhoun argued that a written constitution would never be sufficient to contain the plundering proclivities of a central government .
Some mechanisms for assuring consensus among the citizens of the states regarding " federal " laws would be necessary .
Consequently , Calhoun proposed giving citizens of the states veto power over federal laws that they believed were unconstitutional ( the " concurrent majority " ) .
He also championed the Jeffersonian idea of nullification .
To Calhoun ( and Jefferson ) , states ’ rights meant that the citizens of the states were sovereign over the central government that they created as their agent , and could only be so if such mechanisms — including the right of secession — existed .
Without these political mechanisms the forces of nationalism , mercantilism , and political plunder would relentlessly reshape the Constitution with their rhetoric , and their efforts would eventually overwhelm the strict constructionists .
At that point the Constitution would become a dead letter .
In his new book , The Constitution in Exile , Judge Andrew Napolitano explains in very clear language just how prescient Calhoun was .
The biggest special - interest group of all — the federal government itself — has " seized power by rewriting the supreme law of the land , " as Judge Napolitano says in the subtitle to his book .
Just as Calhoun predicted .
The purpose of the book , says the judge , is to tell " the unhappy story of liberty lost , federalism trampled , and Big Government run amok . "
How did we get to the point , he asks , of where the " federal " ( i.e. , central ) government defines for us the drinking age for alcohol , how much wheat farmers can grow , the ability of terminally ill cancer patients to medicate themselves with marijuana , the amount of sugar that can be used in ketchup , and even the size of toilets ?
Unlike the neocons who surround Judge Napolitano in his appearances on the FOX News Channel , he understands that freedom comes " from God and is inherent to our humanity . . . " " Freedom " is not derived from military adventurism under the guise of phony humanitarianism , as the David Horowitz / William Kristol / Rush Limbaugh / crowd would have us believe .
( For an amusing rendition of this fascistic theory take a look at the web site of the " David Horowitz Freedom Center " ) .
Judge Napolitano is one libertarian who is not intimidated by the forces of political correctness , a defining feature of so many " beltway libertarians . "
Consequently , he is not afraid to recognize the truth about the American founding : " The states were sovereign entities that the Continental Congress could not directly control .
Essentially , there was no binding central government "
Even better , " Congress could not tax the people of the United states ( Ah , the good old days ! ) "
Advocates of centralized governmental power have long falsely associated statements about states ’ rights with racism and slavery , which has intimidated most beltway libertarians , but not Judge Napolitano .
After a lucid explanation of each section of the Constitution the judge discusses how the nationalist / mercantilist coalition , led by Alexander Hamilton and his accomplice Judge John Marshall , conspired to effectively rewrite ( and undermine ) the Constitution almost as soon as he ink was dry on the original copy .
The " Federalists " ( who would eventually morph into the Whigs , and then the Republicans ) never accepted their defeat in the Constitutional convention ( which created a federal , not a national government ) .
Nor did they accept Jefferson ’s election as president .
Thus , two days before his term ended the Federalist President John Adams appointed dozens of " midnight federal judges " and appointed John Marshall to the Supreme Court on March 3 , 1801 , one day before he would leave office .
Marshall " spent the remainder of his career finding clearly disingenuous , historically inaccurate , and highly questionable justifications for ruling that federal power is not limited , " writes Judge Napolitano .
In his most famous decision , Marbury vs. Madison , Marshall gave the federal judiciary the power to rule on the constitutionality of both statutory law and the behavior of the executive branch .
" [ T ] his means that the Supreme Court granted itself the authority to declare the will of the people . . . null and void . . . "
This of course has caused endless mischief and tyranny .
This principle of a monopoly in reviewing constitutionality was not widely accepted , however , until after Lincoln ’s war of 1861 — 1865 destroyed state sovereignty once and for all .
Until that point , many Americans believed that the citizens of the states , as well as the president and Congress , should have equally legitimate claims on interpreting the Constitution .
As President Andrew Jackson famously said , " John Marshall has made his decision , now let him enforce it if he can . "
Marshall and his fellow Federalists , such as Justice Story , also paved the way for the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution .
This clause only grants " supremacy " to the central government on the seventeen specific functions of the central government that are delineated in Article I , Section 8 , period , many of which have to do with waging war and foreign policy .
This power has been grossly abused by implying that the central government is somehow " supreme " in anything and everything vis -à - vis the citizens of the states .
This of course is a perfect recipe for tyranny .
Judge Napolitano recognized that it was Federalists like Joseph Story and John Marshall , and later Whig politicians like Daniel Webster and Abraham Lincoln , who would tell The Big Lie that the Constitution was ratified by " the whole people " and not as it actually was — by the citizens of the sovereign states , with their representatives assembled in state conventions .
" That was both historically incorrect and intellectually dishonest , " says Judge Napolitano .
According to this false view of the American founding the central government was always the master , not the servant , of the people .
This , too , is a perfect recipe for tyranny that has been made by tyrants everywhere ( Hitler even invoked this argument in Mein Kampf to make his case for destroying state sovereignty in Germany ) .
In McCulloch vs. Maryland Marshall enshrined into law Hamilton ’s dangerous ( to liberty ) notion that there were supposedly " implied powers " in the Constitution .
He did this in order to justify a central bank , which is mentioned nowhere in the Constitution under actual powers .
This created the situation where the powers of the central government were only to be limited by the imaginations of federal politicians .
Judge Napolitano proceeds to describe myriad examples of this , from the PATRIOT Act ( " a lawless law because it allows the federal government to obtain information without a warrant , thus violating the Fourth Amendment " ) to census snooping , television regulation , and hundreds of other major and minor power grabs .
By far the most brilliant chapter of The Constitution in Exile is chapter four , entitled " Dishonest Abe : The Lincoln You Did n’t Know . "
Here the judge recounts how , " In order to increase his federalist vision of centralized power , u2018 Honest ’
Abe misled the nation into an unnecessary war . "
And , " with very little regard for honesty , Lincoln increased federal power and assaulted the Constitution .
His actions were unconstitutional , and he knew it . "
Moreover , " Lincoln ’s view was a far departure from the approach of Thomas Jefferson , who recognized states ’ rights above those of the Union . "
He goes on to present chapter and verse of the abuse of the constitution and the consolidation of political power in Washington that took place during and after the Lincoln regime .
" Lincoln increased the power of the federal government at the expense of the rights of the states and civil liberties .
This opened the door to more unconstitutional acts by the government in the 1900s through to today . "
The judge also recognizes that all other countries in the world ended slavery peacefully , which could have happened in the U.S had the slaves not simply been used as political pawns by the neo- federalist Republican Party to achieve its main goal , the consolidation of political power in Washington and the destruction of citizen sovereignty .
" The next time you see Lincoln ’s portrait on a five - dollar bill , " writes Judge Napolitano , " remember how many civil liberties he took away from you ! "
Thanks to the final victory of the Federalist / Whig / Republican cabal continued to enhance governmental power and diminish liberty by perverting the Commerce Clause of the Constitution in the post - war years in ways quite familiar to many LRC readers .
By the late nineteenth century , the monopolistic federal judiciary began attacking capitalism in the name of regulation that supposedly served " the common good . "
The judge is wise enough to understand that capitalism itself serves the common good , and that regulation more often than not is the result of special - interest politics .
These attacks intensified during the New Deal , which " codified socialism , evaded the Constitution , disregarded the Natural Law , and put individualism on the path to extinction . "
And here ’s a shocker : " Between 1937 and 1995 , not a single federal law was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court .
Not one piece of legislation was seen as exceeding the scope of Congress ’s commerce power . "
( Emphasis added ) .
So much for the phony argument that " judicial review " by the federal courts acts to protect liberty .
Instead , it does the opposite :
It expands the size and scope of government at the expense of liberty .
This sad story is told over the course of several of the latter chapters of The Constitution in Exile .
The back cover of Judge Napolitano ’s book has blurbs from such high profile neocons as Bill O’Reilly , Sean Hannity , and Rush Limbaugh ( as well as civil libertarian Nat Hentoff and liberal commentator Alan Colmes ) .
I doubt that the neocons on this list ever read the book , however .
In a chapter entitled " After 9/11 " the judge writes that " The PATRIOT Act and its progeny are the most abominable , unconstitutional governmental assaults on personal freedom since the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 " and " the most unpatriotic of the things that the Bush administration and this [ Republican controlled ]
Congress could have visited upon us . "
( These " most unpatriotic of things " are what O’Reilly , Hannity , and Limbaugh have spent hundreds , if not thousands , of hours defending on their respective television and radio shows . )
And it is indeed unpatriotic and traitorous to the Constitution to support current policy , which is that " federal agents and local police can write their own search warrants , serve them on American financial institutions without the intervention of a judge , and obtain information about you without you even knowing it ! "
The PATRIOT Act " has allowed the government to circumvent completely the Fourth Amendment " and " makes it a crime — punishable by five years in jail — for the recipient of a self - written search warrant to tell anyone that he or she has received the search warrant . "
These rats know that they are rats .
It gets worse .
" The government can now . . . break into your house . . . steal your checkbook , put an electronic bug under your kitchen table , and make it look like it was a house burglary .
It can even leave and not tell you or the local police what has happened . "
Dub - Yuh is recognized as the tyrant and dunce that he is : " President Bush does not recognize the constitutional limitations imposed on his office .
His only concern is with victory over u2018 the enemy , ’ whoever that may be . "
So what can be done ?
Among Judge Napolitano ’s common sense recommendations are abolition of the income tax ( " the Sixteenth Amendment . . . should be abolished outright " ) ; same for the Seventeenth Amendment which called for the direct election of U.S. senators and a return to the system of appointing them by state legislatures ; and the recognition that the federal government will never check its own power .
" Thus , I would clarify the right of the states to secede from the Union , " writes the judge from New Jersey , " losing all the benefits that come from membership [ in the union ] , but regaining all the freedom membership has taken away .
The U.S. government is now characterized by dictatorial power , abuse of every kind of personal liberty , confiscatory taxation , economic fascism , dangerous militarism , and imperialism .
Every American who is concerned about this Nazification of the American government needs to own a copy of The Constitution in Exile .
The Best of Thomas DiLorenzo
Employers have long worried about workers who call in sick so they can surf or watch TV .
Now some experts say companies should pay attention to the flip side of that problem : employees who show up feverish and sneezing .
They even have a word for this behavior , which can hurt productivity just as absenteeism does : “ presenteeism . ”
Though the worry is n’t new , it has gained momentum with fears of a bird - flu pandemic .
Should the disease mutate into a strain that passes from person to person , public health officials say , it could thrive in offices .
“ I wish employers would make it possible for sick employees to stay home , ” said Dr. Jonathan Fielding , public health director for Los Angeles County .
“ Certainly from a public health standpoint that makes sense . ”
Advertisement
Yeah , right , many workers say .
In the real world , calling in sick is often not an option .
“ We ’re in an environment where they just need the bodies to keep things going , ” said Candace Greene , 35 , who oversees substitute teachers for the Los Angeles Unified School District .
And if you do take a sick day , “ you pay for it in attitude when you come back the next day . ”
Even highly paid employees may not get any slack , precisely because they are highly paid , said Dana Cephas , a Los Angeles labor and employment lawyer .
“ A partner ca n’t call a client and say , ‘ I ca n’t get what you want today , because my key attorney is sick , ’ ” he said .
“ Employers say , ‘ We ’re paying you $ 100,000 or $ 200,000 -- you do n’t get sick . ’ ”
Advertisement
But many workers cannot afford to call in sick .
The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 42 % of all workers in private industry are not entitled to sick time .
Even if they do have paid leave , low - wage workers may not want to take it .
Cephas said his father , a janitor , never took a sick day -- because he was paid for his unused leave at the end of the year and “ we needed the money . ”
Recent surveys suggest many employees feel the same .
Ninety percent of workers polled last year by LifeCare , a Connecticut firm that provides counseling and information services to employees , said they had come to work sick .
Most said they showed up because they felt it was “ too risky to be absent ” or worried they would fall behind in their job , according to the study .

Another recent survey found that employers are increasingly aware of the problem .
CCH Inc. , the Illinois - based human resources information firm that conducted the poll , said 48 % of employers last summer said presenteeism was a problem in their companies -- up from 39 % in 2004 .
But some employers fear that workers will slack off if it ’s too easy to stay home .
“ We do n’t want you to come to work when you ’re sick , ” said Carol Dyer , human resources director of West Los Angeles - based Public Communications Services , an 80 - person company that installs and maintains telephones in prisons .
“ But , on the other hand , we expect you to come to work .
If it ’s a mild cold -- well , it ’s like , tough it out . ”
Advertisement
Employers may be encouraging presenteeism by cutting back on sick pay .
Although exact figures are unavailable , some human resources experts believe companies are reducing the number of sick days they provide , with five a year becoming more common .
Moreover , a growing number of employers block workers from accumulating unused sick days from one year to the next .
This may explain rising presenteeism rates because a bad cold combined with a child ’s bout of bronchitis can quickly drain an employee ’s sick - leave account , said CCH analyst Tulay Turan .
“ If you have five days of sick leave and on the sixth day disciplinary action is taken , people do n’t want to take that chance , ” she said .
Advertisement
But many employers are beginning to recognize that they must find ways to make sure workers not only come to work when they ’re well but also stay home when they ’re sick .
“ There are two different kinds of employees -- some people take advantage every time they ’re sick .
There are others who come in and infect the whole place , ” said Marilyn Sherman , human resources director for Otis College of Art and Design in Los Angeles .
“ We encourage people to get the flu shot -- and to stay home if they get it , ” she said .
One answer to the problem of presenteeism may be improving office morale -- so workers are happy to show up when they ’re well , but not afraid to stay home if they ’re not .
Advertisement
Turan said that companies CCH surveyed where employees rated the workplace morale as “ poor ” or “ fair ” have experienced more problems with both presenteeism and absenteeism .
Another may be to encourage telecommuting for workers who must be on the job even if they ’re contagious .
The threat of bird flu could even trigger “ a sea change ” in employer attitudes toward the practice , said John Challenger , chief executive of outplacement firm Challenger , Gray & Christmas .
“ I could see myself choosing that option , ” Challenger said .
“ It would be wrong to infect my co-workers , but I can get work done at home . ”
Advertisement
UCLA business school professor David Lewin thinks cutting presenteeism will depend on the example that employers themselves set by staying home when they are sick .
“ Eventually employers have to ask : Do I want people here who are sick ? ” he said .
“ If they think it through , the answer is going to be more no than yes . ”
Aha - there 's my keys ....
A solar - powered handbag designed by a student from Brunel University promises to make finding keys and other items at the bottom of a bag easier .
The handbag , dubbed Sun Trap , uses a solar cell attached to the outside of the bag to trap energy from sunlight .
The energy is stored in an internal battery which lights up the lining .
The lining is made from an electroluminescent material similar to that found in mobile phones and is lit up by the bag 's zip which acts as a switch .
The bag goes dark when the zip is closed or after 15 seconds if it is accidentally left open .
Safe and useful
A secondary use of the portable battery is as an emergency charger for mobile phones and other wireless devices .
Safety and usefulness were uppermost in Rosanna Kilfedder 's mind when she came up with the design .
" I had the idea for Sun Trap handbag after seeing so many friends frantically searching their bags for house keys , usually on a dark doorstep , " said Ms Kilfedder .
" I also noticed friends using their mobile phones like torches to examine the contents of their bag , which gave me the idea of lighting up the bag , " she said .
The battery should not need conventional charging as it will be topped up every time the bag is outside , but it does have the facility to be charged from the mains as a back - up .
Ms Kilfedder 's bag design has already won a competition held at Brunel University aimed at finding a new generation of entrepreneurs .
Brunel Enterprise Centre , an organisation set up to help students develop their ideas commercially , is helping her apply for a patent and eventually get the bag on the High Street .
新宿ロフトプラスワン岡田斗司夫独演会。
５分前になんとか到着。場内テーブル席は満席だったので演壇上手のボックス席から。初めて座ったけどなかなか落ち着いて見れて面白かった。しかし同じボックスに座った奴がチェーンスモーカーで死んでしまえばいいのに！と思ったよ。
いつものごとくロフトの斉藤さん*1の前説のあと岡田氏登場。
もともとは適当なゲストを呼んで最近のオタクはけしからんなーというヌルいイベントにするつもりだったけど、２日前に進行表を作ったら燃えちゃってせっかくのゲストを断り一人語りで３時間というイベントになったそうな。
第 １部はオタクの現状について。
まずは最近のオタクに対する違和感。
ＴＶチャンピオンのアキバ王選手権の審査員になって、どんな濃いオタクが来るかと期待していたら、出演者が出してきたお宝は単に買ったものだし、好きな声優を応援したいというのに自分がイベントを主催しようとは思いもしなかったという薄いオタクだったこと。真剣１０代しゃべり場で、オタクを差別するなと主張する専門学校生が出たけど、本人はまわりに全然それを言ったことがなくて、まわりがポカーンとしていた話。
それから「萌え」という言葉は実はオタク層には日常的にほとんど使われていないけど、それが便利に使われてしまっていることなど。岡田氏は萌えは解らないでもないけど、それについて評論出来るほど深くはわからないそうな。
以前は○○のファンの符丁が他のジャンルのファンにわからないのは当然だし、それを押しつけたりはしなかったのに、「萌え」がわからないからオタクじゃない、と言われる現状はおかしいのではないか、と疑問を呈する岡田氏。モーオタの萌えとエロゲーマーの萌えは同じじゃないだろうと。
はてな とWikipediaのオタクの項について語ったあと、いよいよ岡田氏が今まで慎重に避けてきたオタクの定義について語る。
「 好きなものを自分で決められる知性と偏見に屈しない精神力を持っている人たち」
だそうで、これは昔から変わっていないとのこと。
それからオタクの世代論。ざっと分けてヤマト・ガンダムの４０代の第１世代、エヴァの３０代の第２世代、ノーブームで好きなジャンルのみの２０代の第３世代。
さらにオタク内オタクの定義について。森川嘉一郎の「ダメを志向するのがオタク」、斎藤環の「２次元に欲情するのがオタク」。どちらもある程度は合ってるけど、どちらも部分を見て全体を語ろうとする定義なので結局しっくりこない。
女性オタクからの定義がないのは、女性がオタクの中心概念を持たず、ジャンルについて他人との差異ばかりに向いているから定義が出てこないという。
やっとここ１０年で海外のオタクが紹介されてオタクがオモシロ系の人として認知されてきたり、知的なイメージがついたりしてきたのに、バベルの塔が崩れたのように、人々の言葉が通じなくなってしまった。
というところで第１部終了。
休憩時間もしゃべる岡田氏。
会場からのアンケートを読んだあと、ゲド戦記の監督を宮崎悟朗が引き受けるまでの話を鈴木Ｐのブログの記事＋ジブリスタジオについての岡田情報でおもしろおかしくお伝え。岡田話芸炸裂で正直ここが一番ウケてた。去年の１２月２６日に家族会議をして以来、親子で一言も話をしてないそうですよ！

第 ２部はオタクの死について。
そもそも第１世代のときの「おたく」は他人から与えられた差別用語で強制収容所のようなものだった。それを第２世代になって「オタク」と書き換えたときから収容所の敷居は下がり、いろんな民族が集まる合衆国になった。
ここで７０年代のＳＦ同人誌に載ってたあるＳＦファンのサークル活動史を紹介。ＳＦの普及のために奮闘するも、どんなに冒険しても上の世代を越えられず、ファン活動はやがてマンネリ化して解体していく、というのは今のオタク文化と同じなのではないか。という。
第１世代は貴族であり、求道的な性格とノブレスオブリージュがあって、生まれながらにして特別なのだからなんでも知らねばならず、世間から蔑まれようと気にしなかった。
第２世代はエリートであり、自らの好きなものの良さは学べば誰にでもわかるはず、というスタンスで、アカデミズムに傾倒する。
しかし第３世代にとって、オタク文化は他人と自分を差別化するアイデンティティであり、第１・第２世代とは共通概念たりえなくなってしまっているという。本田透が女とはリージョンコードが違うというようなもの。
かつてＳＦを知るためには何百というＳＦ小説を読まなければならなかったが、スターウォーズがビジュアルでその魅力を伝えてしまってからは、本を何百冊も読んだり、原語版に当たったり、という苦労は誰もしない。同じＳＦのセンスオブワンダーであっても、一度絵という判りやすいものが出来ると、それ以降は堅い小説のような難しいものは受け入れられないし、その流れは止めようがない。ファンは増えたけど、ＳＦファン以前とは違う人々になってしまった。
同じようにオタク文化においては「萌え」という言葉がオタクを判りやすく伝え、仲間は増えたけど同じようにオタクは以前とは違う人々になってしまった。オタク文化を守ろうと思ったら在日文化のようにその文化を規律で固めていくしかないが、もはやそんなことは不可能なのだ。
オタクは死んだのである。
第 ３部はオタク復活祭。
お客さんにイヤな気持ちで帰ってもらうのはなんなので、これからどうすればよいか？ということをサービスとして語るつもりの岡田氏。
しかし壇上 で 「オタクは死にました。みなさんの言葉を広く伝える評論家もこれからはいません……」と語っているうちに、感極まって壇上で言葉を何度も詰まらせる。
「好きなものの素晴らしさを、これからは個々で発信して他の人に伝えよう」という自ら提唱するプチクリの概念を話し、これを締めとするつもりだったのかもしれないが、自らグダグダになっちゃってごめんなさいと語るとおり、その良さをうまく伝えられないまま予定を１５分ほど早く終了。
実は岡田氏の主張は近著のプチクリでも処女出版の「僕たちの洗脳社会」でも変わっていなかったりするし、それだけ筋が通った話ではある。
こういうステージでは芸人か講師に徹する岡田氏が、第３部でオタクの死について声を詰まらせながら語るのは驚いたが、しかし気持ちはわかる気がする。「国」となぞらえたものが沈むさまを黙って見ているしかないとしたら。これからはお互い暗い海を漂いながら、自ら声を上げて仲間を探し続けるしかないのだ。そして
岡田斗司夫 オタキング であり、自らの国が滅ぶのを自ら認めてしまったのだ。
それにしても今日テレコを忘れちゃったのが心底悔やまれるなあ。
今日のイベントトークをそのまま起こして本にしてくれたら買っちゃうよ。
おつかれさまでした……。

As we walked through the southern suburb of Beirut known as the Dahiya , a chubby , bearded man in the black uniform and tin helmet of Hizbullah , wearing webbing and carrying an AK - 47 , shouted at us from behind .
" Yah , Haj , you can't go there , " he said .
" The MK are flying above .
Go round to the other street . "
The " MK " are what the Lebanese call the unmanned drones Israel has been sending to attack targets in Lebanon over the past week and a half , nicknamed for the initials on their casing .
The Dahiya 's warren of streets has been fortified in the past 10 days with barricades made from construction sand and rubble .
Why do you have all these fortifications , I asked the bearded fighter .
Do you expect the Israelis to invade ?
" God willing , " he said .
" I hope so .
We have been waiting and preparing for this for such a long time now .
The Israelis have n't forgotten their defeat in 2000 [ when they withdrew from Lebanon ] .
We will turn Dahiya into their graveyard . "
Driving around this part of Beirut , the only people you see are fighters , some dressed in black military uniforms , some wearing green camouflaged trousers and black T - shirts , most with green webbing loaded with magazines and grenades and AK - 47s , some only with radios .
They travel mainly on scooters , always in pairs , whizzing through the streets .
But a number of the Hizbullah fighters remaining in Beirut are too young , too old , or too incapacitated from previous clashes with Israel for the battle in south Lebanon .
They are reserves , a sort of Hizbullah Dad's Army , left to guard the home front .
Abu Mostafa is one of these .
He lives in a flat in a five - storey concrete building 10 minutes from the airport .
When I first went to his house , early in the bombing campaign , smoke from the airport 's destroyed fuel depots was still drifting through the air , along with the smell of dead animals from a farm that had been hit a day earlier .
Everywhere , people were fleeing the destruction .
Nearby an elevated highway had collapsed next to a crater that had filled with water .
The whole area smelled of burned plastic and gunpowder .
" I am not leaving my home even if it is flattened with the ground , " Abu Mostafa told me then as he sat in the entrance to his building next to his small grocery shop .
" I have been displaced so many times , I am not going to leave . "
Abu Mostafa is a Shia from the south , originally from a small village close to the city of Tyre .
He and his family were first displaced after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1978 , and then again in the second Israeli invasion in 1982 .
As the war wound down he moved with his family to Beirut 's southern suburbs , a mesh of illegally built concrete buildings on the edge of the airport inhabited mainly by Shia refugees from the south and which became a Hizbullah stronghold .
Abu Mostafa walks with a limp .
One of his legs is shorter than the other because it was hit by a piece of shrapnel .
He was injured seven times when he was a Hizbullah fighter during Lebanon 's civil war in the 80s .
As I visited him almost every day in the week that followed , the landscape around him was changing quickly .
Each day a different building had been reduced to rubble .
Soon a huge area , once home to perhaps a half a million inhabitants , was a ghost town .
Between the nervous fighters , suspicious of any stranger who might be an Israeli spotter or a spy , and the sound of the drones and jets in the sky , Abu Mostafa 's tours got shorter and shorter .
The area of Haret Hreik , where the Hizbullah leadership is supposed to live and from where the group 's TV station , al - Manar , is transmitting , was the worst hit .
Israeli F - 16s and shells fired from warships off the coast razed more than 40 buildings .
" Those sons of dogs are not letting me sleep , " Abu Mostafa told me one morning after a heavy night of bombardment .
The bombing was getting closer but Abu Mostafa refused to move .
" When these events started , my son packed his bag and went down to the south .
He is a fighter with Hizbullah .
He is very religious and a committed young man .
" He has been training for years now , but even I and his mother do n't know what he does when he goes to the training courses , we only see him pack his bags and disappear for a couple of weeks .
They are very secretive and this is why they are successful . "
The next day as we drove around Abu Mostafa made a phone call .
" Yah , Haj , how are you ? " he said into the mobile .
" No , I am staying in Dahiya ... no I wo n't leave .
" Listen , Haj , I just wanted to ask about my son .
He went to the south a week ago .
Any news ? "
There was a pause , and then he said quietly : " There is no God but Allah . "
He rang off and turned to me .
" He told me to consider my son a martyr , " Abu Mostafa said , his eyes fixed on the middle distance .
" He was very strong , " he said .
" For Sayed Hassan [ Nasrallah , the Hizbullah leader ] , nothing is valuable . "
His voice was dry and his eyes began to flicker .
On Thursday , after eight days of bombardment , the Hizbullah press spokesman gave dozens of journalists a guided tour of the ruins of the Dahiya , telling them about the resilience and strength of the Islamic resistance .
Meanwhile , Abu Mostafa , perhaps one of the last inhabitants of the area , was packing his wife and four children and their belongings into a car .
Warning
( Added 2015 ) Some of the documents that we previously received through FOIA suggested that all major manufacturers of color laser printers entered a secret agreement with governments to ensure that the output of those printers is forensically traceable .
Although we still do n't know if this is correct , or how subsequent generations of forensic tracking technologies might work , it is probably safest to assume that all modern color laser printers do include some form of tracking information that associates documents with the printer 's serial number .
( If any manufacturer wishes to go on record with a statement to the contrary , we 'll be happy to publish that here . )
( Added 2017 ) REMINDER : IT APPEARS LIKELY THAT ALL RECENT COMMERCIAL COLOR LASER PRINTERS PRINT SOME KIND OF FORENSIC TRACKING CODES , NOT NECESSARILY USING YELLOW DOTS .
THIS IS TRUE WHETHER OR NOT THOSE CODES ARE VISIBLE TO THE EYE AND WHETHER OR NOT THE PRINTER MODELS ARE LISTED HERE .
THIS ALSO INCLUDES THE PRINTERS THAT ARE LISTED HERE AS NOT PRODUCING YELLOW DOTS .
This list is no longer being updated .
Forensic investigations of the source of documents produced with other printing technologies are also possible , but , as far as we know , printers other than color laser and similar technologies do not deliberately encode their serial numbers in their output .
Introduction
This is a list of color laser printer models that do or do not print yellow tracking dots on their output .
We tried to interpret the information conveyed by these dots as part of our Machine Identification Code Technology Project .
Limitations of this information
A " no " simply means that we could n't see yellow dots ; it does not prove that there is no forensic watermarking present .
( For example , the HP Color LaserJET 8500 series does not include any yellow tracking dots that we can see , but it may still include some kind of forensic marking , since the majority of other Color LaserJET models do .
Other forensic marking techniques have been invented , and we do not yet know how to determine whether these techniques are used by a particular printer . )
A " yes " simply means that we ( or another source , as noted ) saw yellow dots that appeared anomalous to us .
Until we decipher the marking schemes or receive other confirmation , this does not constitute proof that any particular kind of information is represented by these dots .
In a very few cases , for example , they might be the result of a dithering technique , rather than a forensic mark , or they could be the result of a poorly calibrated printer .
In most cases , we are confident that the arrangement of dots is intentional and is intended to track users .
Sources of information
We have employed three sources of information .
We looked at printer output under a blue light and / or a computer microscope ; we consulted press reports about printers ( e.g. at Druckerchannel ) ; we relied on printer manuals and other manufacturer statements .
We welcome additional statements by manufacturers , resellers , or technicians .
Thanks to our friends at software firms and symphonies , public schools and physics labs , semiconductor fabs and ice cream parlors , in about a dozen countries around the world .

紹介 - Introduction
CLOS というのは 、Common Lisp Object System の頭文字をとったもので 、Lispでオブジェクト指向プログラミングを行う人のため、Common Lispに拡張された標準的なセットです。Scheme とは知ってのとおり、Lispの方言で、Common Lispの文法より単純で一貫性のある文法になってます。Tiny CLOS は、Scheme用の CLOS で、1992年に Gregor Kiczales によって書かれました。構文的には CLOS と違いますが、基本的 なOOP へのアプローチは CLOS のそれと一緒です 。
CLOS , an acronym for Common Lisp Object System , is a standard set of extensions to the Common Lisp language to help people do object - oriented programming in Lisp .
Scheme , as you know , is a dialect of Lisp with a simpler , more consistent syntax than Common Lisp's .
Tiny CLOS is a Scheme version of CLOS written in 1992 by Gregor Kiczales .
It differs from CLOS syntactically , but the basic approach to OOP is the same as in CLOS .
どうやっ て Tiny CLOS を使うか - How to Use Tiny CLOS
Tiny CLOS は Scheme で書かれています。ソースコードは、本当に見たいんだったら、tiny-clos.scm
というファイルにあります。ですが、オブジェクトやクラスシステムのためのブートストラップのために、えらい複雑です。理解するのが楽なバージョンは（関数型じゃないんだけど）、tiny-rpp.text
にあります。他の便利なサポートコードは同じディレクトリにあります。
Tiny CLOS is written in Scheme .
The source code , if you really want to look at it , is in the file tiny - clos.scm , but it has a lot of complications due to the need to bootstrap the object and class system ; an easier to understand ( but not functional ) version is in tiny - rpp.text .
Other useful support code is in the rest of this directory .
しかし、ソースコードなんて要りません。もっと便利なのは、tclos
コマンドを使うことです。これは、単純なシェルスクリプトで、
MIT Scheme を
Tiny CLOS をロードした状態のメモリイメージとともに起動するものです。これらの意味がわからなかったら、無視してください。ただ、tclos ってのを使えばいいんですよ 。
However , you do n't need to use the source code : much more convenient is to use the command tclos , a simple shell script that runs MIT Scheme with a memory image that has Tiny CLOS already loaded .
If you do n't know what all that means , ignore it ; just use the command tclos .
CLOS vs. 他 のOOP のアプローチ - CLOS vs. other approaches to OOP
今日、もっとも人気のあるオブジェクト指向言語（例えば
C++ とか Java）は、多くの構文や考え方を共有してます。CLOS
や Tiny CLOS は Lispっぽい構文で、上述した言語のような、ブロック構造の構文とは全然違います。これらはランタイムでの多態(polymorphism )
という考え方（すなわち、関数はいくつか異なる方法で動くけど、それは適用されるオブジェクトの種類に依存してるってこと）とか、継承とか、色々と基本的な全てのほかのOOな言語と共有してます。また、ほとんどのOOな言語のように、CLOSやTiny CLOS はすべてのオブジェクトはクラス（ひとつ以上のスーパークラスによって書かれているんでしょう）の要素であると考えます。
The most popular object - oriented languages today ( e.g. C++ and Java ) share much of their syntax and much of their philosophy .
CLOS and Tiny CLOS have a Lisp - like syntax , very different from the block - structured syntax of the other languages mentioned above .
They share the notions of run-time polymorphism ( i.e. a function that works in several different ways depending on the kinds of objects to which it is applied ) , inheritance , etc. with essentially all other OO languages .
And like most OO languages , CLOS and Tiny CLOS consider every " object " to be an element of a " class " , which may be written in terms of one or more " superclasses " .
CLOSと上述した他の言語との一番顕著な違いは CLOS （ や Tiny CLOS ）では、多態関数は普通の関数、クラスのオブジェクトに縛られていないもののように見え、そのように振舞うことです。反対に、すべてのC++やJavaの多態関数はどれかひとつのクラスに属しており、そのクラスのインスタンスにあった（訳注：メソッドが）起動されます。たとえば、dial という名前のクラスと、多態関数 turn があったとして 、ThisDial という dial （訳注：クラスのインスタンス）を 200 にセットして turn したいとします 。C++ プログラマはこんなふうに書きます。
The most significant difference between CLOS and the other languages mentioned above is that in CLOS ( and Tiny CLOS ) , a polymorphic function looks and behaves like an ordinary function , not tied to any one class of objects .
By contrast , every polymorphic function in C++ , Java , et al ``belongs ' ' to one particular class , and must be invoked in conjunction with an instance of that class .
For example , suppose there were a class named dial and a polymorphic function named turn , and we wished to turn the dial ThisDial to setting 200 .
A C++ programmer would write
This Dial.turn ( 200 ) ;
一方 、CLOS プログラマはこう書きます。
while a CLOS programmer would write
( turn ThisDial 200 )
違いは単に構文的なものではありません。C++
では、複数のオブジェクトを伴う動作は、パラメータの残りとしてそれらの中の一つのオブジェクトに属していなければなりません。別の例で言うと、2つのクラス、LightBulb（電球）とsocket（ソケット）（訳注：クラス名が大文字じゃないって違和感ある。rubyに毒されてるなぁ）があったとします。そして、（その中でも）電球をソケットに付けるような多態関数を書きたかったとします。C++（やJavaとか）では、プログラマが電球にメソッドをつけて、ソケットをパラメータとして受け取るようにするか、その逆（ソケットにメソッドをつけて（訳注：韻を踏んでるなぁ）、電球をパラメータとしてとるよう）にするか選ばなくちゃいけません。
The distinction is not merely syntactic : in C++ , an action that involves multiple objects must " belong " to one of them , with the rest as parameters .
For another example , suppose there are two classes named LightBulb and socket , and we wish to write a polymorphic function that ( among other things ) puts a light bulb into a socket .
In C++ ( or Java or ... ) , the programmer must choose whether to write a method for light bulbs , taking a socket as a parameter , or a method for sockets , taking a light bulb as a parameter :
ThisBulb .
PutIn ( ThatSocket ) ; ThatSocket .
PutIn ( ThisBulb ) ;
それに対して 、CLOS プログラマは単純にこう書きます。
whereas the CLOS programmer simply writes
( PutIn ThisBulb ThatSocket )
結局、多態関数 （CLOS 用語では総称関数( generic function ) という）はいくつかの定義がある普通の関数で、実行時に自動的に引数のクラスに一番ぴったりくる定義が選ばれます。どのクラスのオブジェクトにそのメソッドを適用するかは誰も言及せず、また
C++ が作った friend が少し必要になります。これは、他のクラスであるにも関わらず、そのクラスの private な情報にアクセスすることです 。
In effect , a polymorphic function ( called a " generic function " in CLOS terminology ) is an ordinary function with multiple definitions , which automatically chooses the most appropriate definition at run time based on the classes of its arguments .
No one argument is singled out as " the object " to which the method applies , and there is little need for the C++ construct called a " friend " , a function applied to an object of one class which nonetheless has access to the private information of objects of another class .
この選択は上記で指摘したいくつかの利点があります。また、不利な点もあります。メソッドはある一つのクラスに属すわけではなく、いくつかのクラスの組み合わせに属します。これではメソッドの可視性をコントロールするのが難しく、C++
でいう public / protected / private 識別子をあてはめることができません。この欠点が利点を上回っているかどうかは個人的な、殆ど宗教的な判定でしょう。この点に関するこれ以上の議論については
OOP FAQ part 1 , item 1.19 を参照してください 。
This choice has several advantages , as pointed out above .
It also has disadvantages : since a method belongs not to one specific class but to a combination of classes , it is much more difficult to control the visibility of methods , and the public / protected / private distinction in C++ cannot be applied to methods .
Whether you consider these disadvantages to outweigh the advantages is a personal , almost religious , decision .
For more discussion of this issue , see the OOP FAQ part 1 , item 1.19 .
CLOS のクラスとオブジェクト - Classes and Objects in CLOS
CLOSでは、ほとんどのオブジェクト指向言語のように、すべての オブジェクト( object ) は一つ以上のクラスの要素で、その定義は基底クラス(superclasses)から派生したものです。このオブジェクトの挙動はそのクラスにより決定されます。挙動
というのは次の点に言及します。
In CLOS , as in most object - oriented languages , every " object " is an element of one or more " classes " , whose definitions may be derived from the definitions of other " superclasses " .
The behavior of an object is determined by its class ( es ) : here " behavior " refers to
インスタンス変数、すなわちそのクラスのオブジェクトに関する情報
メソッド、すなわちそのクラスでオブジェクトに適用されたとき、どれくらいいろんな関数が実装されているか
そしてあるいは他の事柄、たとえば？？？
instance variables , i.e. information associated with each object in the class
methods , i.e. how various functions are implemented when applied to objects in the class
and possibly other things like class or pool variables which we sha ' n't discuss at this point
慣例により、クラスの名前は山形括弧で囲みます。たとえば < object > とか < person > とか。（訳注 ：Scheme とか Lisp って、関数名などのシンボルにいろんな記号使えます。使えない記号のほうが少ないです）
By convention , class names in CLOS are surrounded in angle - brackets , e.g. < object > , < person > .
インスタンスの生成 - Creating instances
あるクラスのインスタンスを作るには、make 関数を使います。
To create a new instance of an existing class , use the make function :
( define sam ( make < person > ) )
これは、 < person > クラスのインスタンスを作って、Scheme の変数 sam でそれ（訳注：作ったインスタンス）と束縛します（訳注：Schemeなので、代入じゃないです）。いくつかのクラスは次のように定義されます（以下の初期化を見てください）。新しいインスタンスの属性を設定するための追加の引数が指定できます（そのインスタンス変数を初期化するとか）。たとえば、<person>クラスは次のように定義します。
creates a new instance of the < person > class and binds the Scheme variable sam to it .
Some classes are defined in such a way ( see the initialize function below ) that additional arguments can be provided to the make function to determine properties of the new instance , e.g. to initialize its instance variables .
For example , one might define the < person > class in such a manner that
( define sam ( make < person > ' age 38 ) )
これは新しい < person > のインスタンス変数 age を 38 で初期化します 。
would initialize an instance variable named age of the new < person > to 38 .
クラスの作成 - Creating classes
新しいクラスの作成は、単純にすでに定義したクラス（<class>）のインスタンスを作ることです。たとえば、
Creating a new class can be seen as simply creating a new instance of the predefined class < class > , e.g .
( define < person > ( make < class > ' direct - supers ( list < object > ) ' direct - slots ( list ' name ' age ) ) )
これは、新しいクラスを作り、直接の基底クラスのリストとして1要素のリスト ( < object > ) と、直接のスロットのリスト とし て( name age ) で初期化します。しかし、新しいクラスの作成というのは、そういう一般的な操作で、 make - class 関数として提供されています。二つの引数、( i ) 直接の基底クラス（とくに多重継承をしないなら一つだけ）と ( ii ) スロット、またはインスタンス変数の名前のリストをとります。すべてのScheme の変数のように、これらの変数は型付けされていません。つまり、数 38 やシンボル ' bluebird やリスト ( red green blue ) や、他の Scheme （または Tiny CLOS ）のオブジェクトを関連付けることができます。だから、もっと一般的な 上で述べた < person >
クラスの作り方は次のようになります。
creates a new class , initializing its " list of direct superclasses " to the one - element list ( < object > ) and its " list of direct slots " to ( name age ) .
However , creating a new class is such a common operation that they 've provided a special make - class function to do the job .
It takes two arguments : the list of direct superclasses ( typically only one , until you start playing with multiple inheritance ) and the list of names of " slots " , or instance variables .
Like all Scheme variables , these variables are untyped : you can equally well plug in the number 38 , the symbol bluebird , the list ( red green blue ) , or any other Scheme ( or Tiny CLOS ) object .
So the more common way to create the < person > class above would be
( define < person > ( make - class ( list < object > ) ( list ' name ' age ) ) )
インスタンス変数 - Instance Variables
OOP ではふつう、インスタンス変数という、クラスのインスタンスにそれぞれ関連付けられている変数というのがあります。上の例では、name と age は < person >
のインスタンス変数です。なぜなら、人にはそれぞれ自分の（できるかぎり別々の）名前と歳があるからです。インスタンス変数は、PascalのレコードやCの構造体のフィールドより大きく、よりよいバージョンに見えるでしょう。CLOS用語では、インスタンス変数は スロット( slot ) と言います 。
In OOP in general , an " instance variable " is a variable associated with each individual instance of a class .
In the above example , name and age are instance variables of the class < person > because each person has its own ( possibly distinct ) name and age .
Instance variables may be viewed as a bigger , better version of the fields in a Pascal record or a C struct .
The CLOS word for instance variable is " slot " .
特定のオブジェクトの特定のスロットの値を得るためには slot - ref 関数を使います。これは、二つの引数、つまり問題のオブジェクトとスロットの名前を取り、そのスロットの値を返します。
To get the value of a specified slot in a specified object , use the slot - ref function , which takes two parameters -- the object in question , and the name of the slot -- and returns the value of the slot :
( slot - ref sam ' age ) 38
特定のオブジェクトの特定のスロットについて、その値を変えたい場合は slot -set !
関数を使います。関数名の最後のビックリマークに注目してください。これは（殆どの
Scheme 関数とは違って）これはその引数を実際に変更することを示しています。これは三つのパラメータ、オブジェクト、スロット名、そして新しい値をとります。もし
Sam の誕生日だったらこう書くわけです。
To change the value of a specified slot in a specified object , use the slot - set ! function .
Notice the exclamation point at the end of the function name , indicating that ( unlike most Scheme functions ) this one actually changes its arguments .
It takes three parameters : an object , a slot name , and the new value .
So if it were Sam 's birthday , we might write
( slot - set ! sam ' age (+ 1 ( slot - ref sam ' age ) ) )
スロット名を実装として扱うことは、インターフェースとして扱うよりも、通常よいプログラミングの習慣だと考えられています。なので、あなたの作ったオブジェクトクラスのユーザは、そのオブジェクト内部のスロットに直接アクセスしません。これは、二つの理由によります。(1 ) もしユーザが特定の名前のスロットに依存しはじめると、インスタンス変数の名前の変更や削除の自由がなくなります。(2) また、オブジェクトはいくつかの関連した変更すべきでない情報を保持するだろうが、原則的に、見てないうちにユーザにそのどれかの変更をしようとするのをやめさせる方法はありません。だから、殆どの
CLOS クラスは アクセス関 数( access function ) を用意します。これは、どのようにその情報が格納されているかを知る必要なく（スロットの名前や、どんなのがスロットに格納されているかということ）引き出すことができます。他の種類のアクセス関数は、オブジェクトについての正しい情報の変更を、繰り返しますがどのように情報が格納されているかということ知る事なしに可能にします。さてと・・・。
It is generally considered good programming practice to treat slot names as implementation , rather than interface , so users of your object class do n't access slots in your objects directly .
This is for two reasons : first , if users start relying on your objects to contain slots with specific names , you lose the freedom to change the implementation by renaming or even eliminating some of those instance variables ; and second , an object may contain several pieces of related information that must be kept consistent , an essentially impossible task if users can change one piece of information at a time behind your back .
Accordingly , most CLOS classes are provided with " access functions " whose purpose is simply to give the user certain information about the object , without the user ever knowing how that information is stored ( the slot name , or even whether it is stored in a slot at all ) .
Another kind of access function allows the user to change certain information about an object , again without knowing how that information is stored .
Which brings us to ...
総称関数とメソッド - Generic functions and methods
多態は総称関数と呼ばれている何かで実現されています。これは、（潜在的に）いくつか違った定義（メソッド）をそなえており、実行時にその引数によってひとつ選択されます。
Polymorphism is provided in CLOS by something called a generic function : a function with ( potentially ) several different definitions ( methods ) , one of which is chosen at run -time based on the classes of the arguments .
総称関数の作成 - Creating generic functions
CLOS では make - generic 関数によって新しい総称関数を作ることができます。これは引数をとりません。
You can create a new generic function in CLOS with the make - generic function , which takes no arguments :
( define turn ( make - generic ) )
add - method によって、メソッドを総称関数に追加することができます。こちらのほうが利用頻度は高いでしょう。実際、まだ総称関数として make - generic で定義してない総称関数に add - method を呼んだ場合、それを定義するため、 make - generic は結局必要ではありません 。
You 'll probably use the function add - method , which adds a method to an existing generic , much more often .
Indeed , if you apply add - method to a generic that has n't already been defined with make - generic , it 'll define it for you , so you actually never need make - generic at all .
( add - method turn this - method )
メソッドの作成と追加 - Creating and attaching methods
さて、make - generic か add - method によって総称関数が作れるようになりました。また、（後者では）新しいメソッド( method ) をそれに追加することができます。しかし、メソッドってなんでしょう？ 早い話、メソッドは普通 の
Scheme 関数定義に、どのメソッドを適用すればいいかを知るための、どのクラスがどの引数になければならないかという情報を加えたものです。メソッドは make - method という関数で作られます 。make - method は二つの引数をとります。ひとつはクラスのリスト、もうひとつは関数（例によって lambda式で）です。例です 。
OK , so you can use make - generic or add - method to create a generic function , and ( in the latter case ) attach a new " method " to it .
But what is a " method " ?
In a nutshell , a method is an ordinary Scheme function definition , together with information indicating what classes which arguments have to belong to in order for this method to be applicable .
Methods are constructed by a function named make - method , which takes two arguments , a list of classes and a function ( typically presented as a lambda - form ) .
For example ,
( define this - method ( make - method ( list < dial > < number > ) ( lambda ( cnm dial setting ) ( while (< ( position - of dial ) setting ) ( turn - up dial ) ) ) ) )
ここで、このメソッドは最初の引数のクラスが < dial > で、次が < number > である場合に呼ばれます。本体は lambda 式で、二つの引数 dial と setting を取り、希望の設定になるかそれをこえるまでダイアルを回します（事前に position - of と turn - up はどこかに書いてあるものとします）。（訳注：turn - up ってどう訳すんだろう） 。
Here we 've defined a method which applies whenever the first argument is a < dial > and the second is a number .
Its body is the lambda - form that takes two arguments named , dial and setting , and repeatedly turns up the dial until its position matches or exceeds the desired setting .
( I assume that position - of and turn - up are already written somewhere . )
多分、説明していない cnm という、上の lambda式で出てきたパラメータが気になるでしょう。殆どのオブジェクト指向言語では、スーパークラスとほとんど同じだけど、それに少し前処理や後処理を加えたりすることが（普通）できます。CLOS
ではスーパークラスのメソッドを書き直す必要がないように、スーパークラスのメソッドを呼び出す方法があります。Tiny CLOS の実装では、メソッドが呼ばれたときには最初のパラメータに call - next - method というものが渡され、単純にそれを呼び出すことで同じ generic の基底クラスのメソッドを呼び出すことができる（訳注：いい加減）。不幸なことに、call-next-method 機能を利用しようとは思わなくても、各メソッドはこのように余分な最初の引数を持たなければなりません。どのように使うかは後述します。
You have no doubt noticed the unexplained " cnm " parameter to the lambda - form above .
In most object - oriented languages , it is possible ( and common ) for a method to do almost the same thing as the corresponding method for a superclass , but with a little extra work before or after .
To avoid having to rewrite all the code from the superclass 's method , CLOS provides a way to invoke the superclass 's method for the same generic .
The Tiny CLOS implementation of this is , whenever a method is invoked , to give it a function named " call - next - method " as its first parameter , so that if it wishes to invoke the superclass 's method for the same generic , it can do so by simply calling call - next - method .
It is perhaps unfortunate that , even if you do n't intend to use the call - next - method mechanism , every method must take an extra first parameter just in case .
We 'll discuss how to use this mechanism later .
練習で、このメソッドを総称関数 turn に追加で悩むことはないでしょう。こうやります。
In practice , you probably would n't bother defining this - method and then adding it to the generic turn ; instead , you would probably do both in one step :
( add - method turn ( make - method ( list < dial > < number > ) ( lambda ( cnm dial setting ) ( while (< ( position - of dial ) setting ) ( turn - up dial ) ) ) ) )
総称の初期化 -
The initialize generic
たくさんのオブジェクト指向システムではたくさんの既に定義されたクラスとメソッドがついており、ユーザが必要に応じてそれらのサブクラスを作ってメソッドをオーバーライドすることを期待します。一つの例として、generic
の初期化、つまりクラスのインスタンスが生成されたときに自動的に呼ばれるものがあります。初期化の最初の引数は生成中のオブジェクトで、2番目は作成時に与えられた残りの引数です。（訳注：最初の引数は cnm じゃん。だから一個ずつずれる ）
Many object - oriented systems come with a variety of classes and methods already defined , and expect the user to create subclasses and override those methods as need be .
One example is the initialize generic , which is called automatically whenever make creates a new instance of a class .
The first argument to initialize is the object being created , and the second is a list of any extra arguments that were given to make .
混乱しますね。ここに例があります。上記のような < person > クラスを作るとしましょう。そして、<person>オブジェクト作成と同時に人の名前（と、任意で歳）を与えることにしましょう。こう書きます。
I know that 's a little confusing ; here 's an example that may help .
Suppose we 've defined the < person > class as above , and we want to provide a person 's name ( and , optionally , age ) at the same time we create a < person > object .
We might write
( add - method initialize ( make - method ( list < person > ) ( lambda ( cnm obj initargs ) ( slot - set ! obj ' name ( car initargs ) ) ( unless ( null ( cdr initargs ) ) ( slot - set ! obj 'age ( cadr initargs ) ) ) ) ) )
ここで、こう書くと " Sam " という人が作れます 。
Now we can create a person named " Sam " by typing
( define friend1 ( make < person > " Sam " ) )
そして、別 の25 歳の " Jeff " をこう書けば作れます 。
and another , 25 - year - old , person named " Jeff " by typing
( define friend2 ( make < person > " Jeff " 25 ) )
初期化のための initialize という名前の slot の generic はよく使うため、 < object > クラスのサブクラス < init - object >
を作りました。これは、初期化メソッドがスロット名と値のリストをとります。initargs.scm
で（このとても単純な）ソースを見てください。典型的な使い方は次のようになります。
Since a fairly common use of the initialize generic is simply to initialize named slots , I 've written a subclass of < object > named < init - object > whose initialize method accepts a list of slot names and values ; see initargs.scm for the ( fairly simple ) source code .
A typical use would be
( define < person > ( make - class ( list < init - object > ) ( list ' name ' age ) ) ) ( define pal ( make < person > ' name " Jane " ' age 46 ) )
これはユーザはslot名を知らないべきであるという原則に違反しています。<init-object >
クラスは、単に解説する例を作るのを便利にするためのものです。
This violates the principle that users should n't know the names of slots ; the < init - object > class is just a convenience for constructing illustrative examples quickly .
例 - An example
さあ、完璧な例を試してみましょう。ロボットアームにダイアルを回すよう伝える仮の関数なんて必要ないような例でね。取り組む問題は、ニューヨークの仮の大学（訳注：この記事はAdelphi Universityの授業用らしいです）の、学生がどのコースを登録したかを把握するというものです。この問題の説明には2つの明らかなオブジェクト、student と course があるので、それらのクラスを作りましょう。初期化を簡単にするために、< init-object >
のサブクラスとします。実際、<person>クラスはすでに<init-class >
のサブクラスで、name と age をもってます。 < student > を < person > クラスのサブクラスとして、まだ < person > クラスにない情報とメソッドを足して作りましょう。
Let 's try a more complete example , one that does n't require hypothetical functions to tell a robot arm to turn a dial .
The problem at hand is to keep track of a collection of students , each of whom is registered for various courses at a hypothetical University in New York .
The two most obvious objects in the problem description are " student " and " course " , so let 's create classes for them .
For ease of initialization , let 's just make them subclasses of < init - object > .
In fact , since a < person > is already a subclass of < init - object > and already has a name and an age , let 's make < student > a subclass of < person > , with only the additional information and methods that are n't already in the < person > class .
( define < student > ( make - class ( list < person > ) ( list ' credits ' course - list ) ) ) ( define < course > ( make - class ( list < init - object > ) ( list ' name ' room ' time ' prof ' student - list ) ) )
スロットの名前をユーザに知られたくないから、アクセス関数を定義しましょう。
Since we do n't want users of these objects to know the slot names , we 'll define some access functions :
( add - method get - name ( make - method ( list < student > ) ( lambda ( cnm student ) ( slot - ref student ' name ) ) ) ) ( add - method get - courses ( make - method ( list < student > ) ( lambda ( cnm student ) ( slot - ref student ' course - list ) ) ) ) ( add - method get - class ( make - method ( list < student > ) ( lambda ( cnm student ) ( let ( ( credits ( slot - ref student ' credits ) ) ) ( cond ( ( < credits 30 ) ' freshman ) ( (< credits 60 ) ' sophomore ) ( (< credits 90 ) ' junior ) ( else ' senior ) ) ) ) ) ) ( add - method get - name ( make - method ( list < course > ) ( lambda ( cnm course ) ( slot - ref course ' name ) ) ) ) ( add - method get - room ( make - method ( list < course > ) ( lambda ( cnm course ) ( slot - ref course ' room ) ) ) ) ( add - method get - time ( make - method ( list < course > ) ( lambda ( cnm course ) ( slot - ref course ' time ) ) ) ) ( add - method get - prof - name ( make - method ( list < course > ) ( lambda ( cnm course ) ( slot - ref course ' prof ) ) ) ) ( add - method get - roster ( make - method ( list < course > ) ( lambda ( cnm course ) ( slot - ref course ' student - list ) ) ) )
ほとんどのアクセス関数は単純にスロットの参照を呼ぶだけですが、そうである必要がないことに注意してください。もしユーザが同様に学生クラスを作ろうとしたとき、？？？
Notice that , although most of these access functions are simply calls to slot - ref , there 's no reason they need be : if users are likely to want a student 's class standing , yet the implementer decides to store the number of credits the student has completed , an " access function " like get - class may do significant work of its own .
Recall that we made < student > and < course > subclasses of < init - object > to allow easy initialization .
However , let 's insist that all students are created with no courses , and all courses are created with no students .
We can do this by overriding their initialize methods :
( add - method initialize ( make - method ( list < student > ) ( lambda ( call - next - method student initargs ) ( call - next - method ) ( slot - set ! student ' course - list ( ) ) ) ) ) ( add - method initialize ( make - method ( list < course > ) ( lambda ( call - next - method course initargs ) ( call - next - method ) ( slot - set ! course ' student - list ( ) ) ) ) )
In other words , even if some user does try to provide a course list or student list as an argument to make , they 'll be set back to the empty list afterwards .
Of course , the main reason for keeping track of students and courses is for the former to take the latter .
So we 'd like to write two functions add and drop , each taking a student and a course : ( add sam csc272 ) registers Sam for CSC 272 , both adding Sam to the course roster for CSC 272 and adding CSC 272 to Sam 's schedule , while ( drop sam csc272 ) removes Sam from the course roster and CSC 272 from Sam 's schedule .
Of course , things might go wrong .
Sam might try to add a course for which he 's already registered , or to drop a course for which he 's not already registered , or to add a course that conflicts with another course he 's already taking , etc .
So we may need these functions to return some kind of error indication if they do n't work .
If they do work , let 's have them return #f so the result can be tested easily , e.g. ( if ( add sam csc272 ) ...)
( add - method add ( make - method ( list < student > < course > ) ( lambda ( cnm student course ) ( cond ( ( memv student ( get - roster course ) ) " Error : student already in course roster " ) ( ( memv course ( get- courses student ) )
" Error : course already in student 's list of courses " ) ( else ( add - student student course ) ( add - course course student ) # f ) ) ) ) ) ( add - method drop ( make - method ( list < student > < course > ) ( lambda ( cnm student course ) ( cond ( ( not ( memv student ( get - roster course ) ) )
" Error : student not in course roster " ) ( ( not ( memv course ( get- courses student ) ) )
" Error : course not in student 's list of courses " ) ( else ( remove - student student course ) ( remove - course course student ) # f ) ) ) ) )
These functions take care of the error - checking , but rely on four more ( as yet unwritten ) functions named add - student , add - course , remove - student , and remove - course to do the actual change .
Since these four functions have to modify the internal state of < student > and < course > objects , we 'll make them part of the interface to these classes :
( add - method add - student ( make - method ( list < student > < course > ) ( lambda ( cnm student course ) ( slot - set ! course ' student - list ( cons student ( get- roster course ) ) ) ) ) ) ( add - method add - course ( make - method ( list < course > < student > ) ( lambda ( cnm course student ) ( slot - set ! student ' course - list ( cons course ( get- courses student ) ) ) ) ) ) ( add - method remove - student ( make - method ( list < student > < course > ) ( lambda ( cnm student course ) ( slot - set ! course ' student - list ( delv student ( get- roster course ) ) ) ) ) ) ( add - method remove - course ( make - method ( list < course > < student > ) ( lambda ( cnm course student ) ( slot - set ! student ' course - list ( delv course ( get- courses student ) ) ) ) ) )

Some of the biggest names in documentary filmmaking have denounced a recent agreement between the Smithsonian Institution and Showtime Networks Inc. that they say restricts makers of films and television shows using Smithsonian materials from offering their work to public television or other non-Showtime broadcast outlets .
Ken Burns , whose documentaries " The Civil War " and " Baseball " have become classics of the form , said in an interview yesterday that he believed that such an arrangement would have prohibited him from making some of his recent works , like the musical history " Jazz , " available to public television because they relied heavily on Smithsonian collections and curators .
" I find this deal terrifying , " Mr. Burns said in a telephone interview from San Francisco , where he is filming interviews for a documentary on the history of the national parks .
" It feels like the Smithsonian has essentially optioned America 's attic to one company , and to have access to that attic , we would have to be signed off with , and perhaps co-opted by , that entity . "
On March 9 , Showtime and the Smithsonian announced the creation of Smithsonian Networks , a joint venture to develop television programming .
Under the agreement , the joint venture has the right of first refusal to commercial documentaries that rely heavily on Smithsonian collections or staff .
Those works would first have to be offered to Smithsonian on Demand , the cable channel that is expected to be the venture 's first programming service .
Bubbly is no secret to science .
When you pop a Champagne cork , yeasts ferment sugars and form carbon dioxide gas .
But only recently has a solution to spirit's mysterious gas " trains " — the tiny beads of rising air that gives champagne its sparkle — bubbled to the surface .
Scientists at the University of Reims , France have discovered that tiny gas pockets and fibers stuck on the inside of a glass — from dust or a towel used for drying — influence the timing of the bubble trains .
" Fibers entrap a tiny air pocket when Champagne is poured , " said physicist Gerard Liger - Belair .
" Then , this tiny air pocket literally sucks the [ dissolved ] carbon dioxide . "
The gas bubbles grow inside the fibers , detaching from them once they reach the tip of a fiber .
Filming bubbles in a lab setting with high - speed cameras , Liger - Belair observed that as the concentration of carbon dioxide decreases in the Champagne , the distance between bubbles can suddenly change .
That 's why your celebratory beverage bubbles at different rates as you sip .
" This tiny bubbling system is the smallest bubbling system presenting such instabilities ever observed , " Liger - Belair told LiveScience .
" And what a beguiling place to discover it ! "
The findings are published in the Oct. 4 issue of the journal Agriculture and Food Chemistry .
The discovery suggests an experiment you can try at home .
To add more fizz to a flute , wipe a glass with zeal to leave behind extra fibers .
Or if you prefer a calmer toast , air - dry glasses upside down .

Mystery Monday : Each Monday , this LiveScience series explores an amazing aspect of the world around you .
Previous Mystery Monday articles :
There are many situations in the world of photography where you will have to decide how you want to capture a moving subject .
Whether it is an athlete running down the field or a bird swooping over the water there are many different photo outcomes possible .
You could end up with everything in the scene perfectly displayed without any blur or you could end up with the subject in focus while the background is blurred from panning .
In this article we will discuss the different techniques you could use in order to end up with different results .
Freezing the Motion
If you would like to freeze the motion of the subject along with the motion of the background , you should use a very high shutter speed .
I would use a shutter speed of at least 1/300th of a second in order to make sure that you freeze everything .
But there are other subjects you might find that will be moving unusually fast such as cars or thrown objects .
If you would like to freeze a faster moving object you will probably need to use a shutter speed closer to 1/1000th of a second or faster .
This should n’t be a problem now because the new cameras are coming out with shutter speeds of up to 1/8000th of a second .
Motion Blur of the Whole Scene
If you are trying to blur everything in the photo to convey how fast everything is moving to the viewer , then you should try a slower shutter speed .
Anything below 1/100th of a second should do the trick .
I have used this for more artistic photos of passing motorcycles or cars as well as running animals .
This technique is best used when the scene you are taking a photo of is full of bright colors .
In this type of photo the subject is blurred so it is not often used , people are n’t used to seeing this kind of work .
And because people are n’t used to this kind of work , I have seen many excellent photos like this sell for a lot of money .
This type of photo also works very well with patterns in nature .
Such as colorful trees waving in the breeze or flowing water with colorful reflections .
This combination of blur with a lot of color can create a photo that looks more like a painting .
Panning
This is a more difficult technique that requires a lot of practice and skill .
In this type of exposure the photographer uses a somewhat slower shutter speed and moves the camera at the same rate as the moving subject .
When done correctly , the subject is clearly in focus without blur while the background is blurred ; giving the viewer the appearance of rapid motion .
This is the most common method used by nature photographers and sports photographers when they want to show their subjects moving across a scene rapidly .
Some of my favorite photos that I have taken involved using this technique with speeding dirt bikers and soaring birds with trees and flowers blurred in the background .
Many photographers work very hard to master the skill of panning .
I myself have practiced following the movement of sports players with a slower shutter speed to try to follow the movement of their faces .
Occasionally I would get it right and have their face clearly exposed while some of their limbs and the background blurred behind them from the slow shutter speed .
These are most commonly the kinds of photos that win awards in a sports photography contest .
Motion Blur of Just the Subject ( Tripod is a Must )
If you would like to have a clear scene while your subject blurs past with speed , you will have to figure out a way to keep the camera steady enough to capture the background clearly while your shutter stays open an extended amount of time .
This method can obtain some amazing photos and is commonly used at night with cars and headlights .
I ’m sure you have seen photos of a freeway at night with the headlights of cars making lines through the exposure .
This definitely required some sort of tripod and a very long shutter speed ; a shutter speed probably multiple seconds long .
When I use this method I usually set my camera up on a tripod of some sort and simply set the self - timer so I do n’t have to hold the shutter button down and risk moving the camera .
By setting the self - timer the camera automatically takes the photo after somewhere around 10 seconds so you do n’t have to hold it .
The best night photos I have taken involved using this technique while some cars or trains sped through the scene leaving their trail .

As a leader , manager or executive , what is your driving force in business ?
Think about it for a second .
What gets you out of bed in the morning and makes you take that drive to work ?
What is behind the choices you make ?
How do you set your goals and ambitions ?
There are many possible answers .
Ask a thousand people and you ’ll get a thousand different answers .
Money would probably show up quite often .
So would power , influence , getting ahead , recognition , security and success .
But I believe that there is one underappreciated driving force in business .
One force that spurs people on to stellar results , wise decisions and strong business relationships .
One strong force that , when harnessed in your work life , will make you more efficient and let you enjoy work more .
One that all business leaders everywhere need to know about and build into their businesses at the most fundamental level .
Curious yet ?
Here it is :
The strongest driving force in business is happiness !
Yes , happiness at work .
I know that work is often seen as a desolate wasteland , a thoroughly unpleasant experience you endure to make a living .
Work is tough , darnit , and it should be !
If people were enjoying themselves it would n’t be work !
But that ’s simply wrong .
I know , and studies back this up , that people do their best work only when they enjoy what they do .
It does n’t mean we have to love every single aspect of our jobs , but when we like work more than we hate it , we are much more efficient and productive .
There are three major areas where you as a leader can harness this force and use happiness to drive your business and your career .
1 : Make your employees happy
Studies consistently show that employees who like their jobs take fewer sick days , stay in their jobs longer , are more productive , give better customer service and do work of a higher quality .
In fact , happy employees consistently outperform unhappy employees in every single area you can come up with .
Take a closer look at most business success stories and you ’ll find at the root of them a group of people who went to work thinking “ MAN , this is great – I cannot believe how much fun it is to work with this team on this project ! ”
And that ’s why all employers and leaders must focus on their people first and make sure they are happy at work .
But does n’t the customer come first ?
Sure .
And when the company puts the employees first , the employees put the customers first , because happy people naturally give great customer service .
Think about it :
Who would you rather be served by in a restaurant :
The surly waiter who hates his boss and his co-workers or the happy waitress who loves working there ?
2 : Make your customers happy
What is your goal :
To sell as much as possible ?
To maximize the numbers and meet your sales budget ?
To upsell every time ?
Or is it to make your customers happy ?
The latter option is the one that will gain you committed fans for life .
Customers who know that you have their best interests at heart and genuinely want what ’s good for them will keep coming back for more .
You may do a little less business right now , but you ’ll do a lot more business in the long run .
Businesses who choose this approach also have the satisfaction of knowing that they ’re helping people .
3 : Make yourself happy at work
What about you ?
Do you enjoy your work ?
Do you whistle happily going to work and going home ?
Are you doing the things you enjoy doing ?
Do you like and trust the people around you ?
You yourself , as a business leader , need to be happy at work for one simple reason :
If you hate your job , it ’s going to rub off on every single person there .
As a leader you set the tone and people will notice whatever you do .
Set an example and make youself happy at work .
And when you do this you will also become more successful .
A recent study showed that while success does make people happy , the link is much stronger the other way , meaning that happy people are much more likely to become successful and wealthy .
This is not surprising when you think about it , because happy people are more optimistic , energetic , likeable and creative  all essential qualities in business .
The real choice
And this is what some of the best and most profitable companies arounnd the world have realized :
That it ’s not about sacrificing your business goals and your profits in order to be happy .
That in reality , making happiness your driving force in business will make you more profitable .
You do n’t have to choose between happiness at work and success  the real choice is this :
Do you want your business to be happy and more successful ?
Or unhappy and less successful ?
Tough choice , huh :o )
The question is of course :
What can I do about it ?
How can I make myself and other happy at work ?
Check back tomorrow for a challenge to all leaders – a simple way to create the fundamentals for happiness at work for yourself and your people .

Whenever I 'm on a box that I manage , I tend to succumb to a nervous habit of checking the load average of the system frequently with `w` or `uptime` .
A few years ago , getting tired of having to keep an eye on it that way , I pondered the possibility of having the current load average visible in my shell prompt .
It would be even better , I thought , if the prompt would also change color to reflect the level of load .
In fact , being able to stick dynamic data of any kind into the prompt would open the door to a myriad of ideas , but how does one go about it ?
I had always been aware of the substitution escape sequences available in most shells including standard prompt elements like \u for user , \h for hostname , etc .
But what I wanted to know was can you get arbitrary data , the output of programs or scripts , into the prompt ?
It turns out you can , and it's not very difficult , at least with GNU bash .
If you look at the man page , the following shell variable is listed ,
... PROMPT_COMMAND
If set , the value is executed as a command prior to issuing each primary prompt .
...
As stated , when this variable is set , the shell will execute the command it contains prior to each output of the prompt .
With it , we can reset the contents of the prompt each time it is displayed , like so ,
PROMPT_COMMAND ='PS1 =" `date` " '
In this example , just before the prompt is displayed , the value of PS1 ( bash 's primary prompt format variable ) will be set to the output of the date command , followed by a space .
It looks like this ,
Thu Oct 19 15:30:27 EDT 2006 uname -m x86_64 Thu Oct 19 15:30:29 EDT 2006
See how the time changes ?
I admit that this example is not incredibly useful or attractive , but it suffices as a simple illustration .
The point is that by manipulating PS1 in PROMPT_COMMAND , you can insert the output of any program or bash function into your prompt , each time the prompt is redisplayed .
Armed with this knowledge , it was pretty easy to get the load average , nicely colored , into the prompt .
Consider the following ruby script ,
#!/usr/bin/ruby # uptime.rb load_avg = IO.read ( " / proc/loadavg " , 4 ) .to_f mail = Dir.entries ( " /home/cody /Maildir/new " ) .
length <= 2 ? " " : " + " if load_avg <= 0.05 printf " %0.2 f %s " , load_avg , mail elsif load_avg <= 0.25 printf " \\ [ \033 [ 32 m \ \ ] % 0.2f %s\\[ \033[00 m\\ ] " , load_avg , mail elsif load_avg <= 0.50 printf " \\[ \033 [ 33 m \ \ ] % 0.2f %s\\[ \033[00 m\\ ] " , load_avg , mail else printf " \\ [ \033 [ 31 m \ \ ] % 0.2f %s\\[ \033[00 m\\ ] " , load_avg , mail end
The script reads the first four bytes of / proc / loadavg , which should contain the load average for the past sixty seconds , and prints it to stdout wrapped in shell escape sequences that color the value based on how high it is .
Load averages will be displayed in red if above 50 % , orange if above 25 % but below 50 % , and so on .
As an added bonus , it also checks my maildir and , if I 've got new mail , adds an indicating character to the prompt .
Below is the required PROMPT_COMMAND and a few examples of what the prompt looks like .
PROMPT_COMMAND ='PS1=" \u@\h(`~/bin/uptime.rb` ) % " ' cody@gypsy ( 0.02 ) % cody@gypsy ( 0.77 ) % cody@gypsy ( 0.21 + ) %
One last tweak I find useful is to display the number of currently backgrounded jobs , as it prevents me from backgrounding emacs or other interactive programs and then forgetting about them .
bash includes the ' \j ' escape for this purpose , but I 'd only like to see the number in my prompt if there 's at least one backgrounded job .
It 's simple enough to whip up a bash function to get us there .
Here 's the script , the updated PROMPT_COMMAND and the new prompt in action ,
get_jobs ( ) { num_jobs=`jobs | wc - l` if [ $ num_jobs - ne " 1 " ] then let " num_jobs -= 1 " echo -n " / ${num_jobs} " fi } PROMPT_COMMAND=' PS1=" \u@\h(`~/bin/uptime ; get_jobs` ) % " ' cody@gypsy ( 0.09 ) % cat & [ 1 ] 12165 [ 1 ] +
Stopped cat cody@gypsy ( 0.08/1 ) % cat & [ 2 ]
12171 [ 2 ] +
Stopped cat cody@gypsy ( 0.08/2 ) %
I 've found this technique to be very handy .
While there is certainly a limit to the amount of junk you can cram into your prompt before it becomes unwieldy , I think the combination of user , host , load average , mail , and jobs results in something that is pretty useful but still pleasant to look at .
Not , of course , that there 's any trouble in paradise or anything , but it looks like Guy Ritchie was n't altogether comfortable watching Madonna dance with Lenny Kravitz .
He stormed over , pulled the pair apart and " growled " " time to go home . "
The suggestion is that he was jealous seeing his wife slow - dancing with her ex , but he may well have just been intervening before they pair hatched plans to record a duet .
In which case , we should give that man five pounds from parish funds .
Meanwhile , this morning 's Sun reports more worrying news for Madonna :
MADONNA may have to fill her kettle from a STANDPIPE after a water main burst outside her £ 6 million mansion in Marble Arch , West London .
We can picture the scene :
Guy :
It says here you might have to fill your kettle from a standpipe , love
Madonna :
What the hell is one of those ?
Guy :
It 's a type of temporary tap they use during water emergencies
Madonna :
No , no - the other thing ... what 's a keckle ?
Reporters and Parrots
Real Reporter
Parrot Can you tell the difference ?
In high school , my teacher Ms. Sargon imagined that I could be a science editor at the New York Times .
My career took a different path , but I 'm grateful for the time I spent on the high school newspaper ( it gave me many lessons on how to write ) and I always thought that journalism would have been a good alternative .
Lately , however , I 've been appalled by several instances of shoddy reporting .
I realize that there have always been good and bad reporters , as there are in any profession , but I think that the profession as a whole has become too lax in accepting thew following four flaws :
Parroting :
The reporter 's job is to do research to find the facts .
But too often they seem to parrot back whatever is fed to them by press releases , politicians , or other news reports .
My friend Joe C. calls this the stenographic approach to reporting .
Deception : Public figures lie ( Martha Stewart , Kenneth Lay ) , and reporters do not know who to trust .
Reporters lie , either to advance their career ( Jayson Blair ) or to serve the interests of their corporate sponsors .
Sometimes the deception is self - deception : reporters ( and others ) believe what they want to believe .
Innumeracy : Prof. John McCarthy has touted the slogan
He who refuses to do arithmetic is doomed to talk nonsense , and John Allen Paulos wrote a book on Innumeracy .
Perhaps the budding reporters with an ability for arithmetic end up in other fields ( like me ) , but it does seem that reporters repeatedly show they are not capable of simple multiplication and division .
Equal Time : Perhaps influenced by the sports pages , reporters tend to see issues as a competition with two sides , which must both be covered equally .
Sometimes this is true , but sometimes one side has a preponderance of evidence .
Reporters should do enough research to determine who is right and say so .
They are too easily manipulated by those who have few facts on their side , but get equal press time anyways just by talking loudly .
Here are some examples of the four problems .
Parroting and Innumeracy in Financial Reporting
Google has almost twice as many search ad clickthroughs as runner - up Yahoo .
In December , Google had 16.5 trillion ad clickthrough , compared with Yahoo's 9 trillion , according to Nielsen / NetRatings .
To me , 16.5 trillion ad clicks in a month is obviously an error , and I thought that anyone with a sixth - grade education could immediately see that .
Fortunately , I have a sixth - grader in my house , so I asked her .
" No way , Dad ; none of my friends click on the ads " she said .
I pointed out that somebody must click on them ; they did bring in $ 6 billion this year .
She pondered that and asked " How many people in the world ? "
I told her about 6 billion , and she was able to estimate that maybe a third of them had computers and half of those clicked on the ads , leaving 1 billion people to generate 16.5 trillion clicks , which makes 16,500 clicks per user in December .
" That is so not happening , Dad " she concluded , thereby demonstrating a minimum requirement for reporting : the ability to ask the right question ( " How many people in the world ? " ) , do some simple arithmetic , and follow through to a conclusion .
Another way to come to that conclusion would be to estimate how much revenue those 16.5 trillion clicks generate .
A quick look at the Google AdWords FAQ shows that the minimum price for an ad is $ 0.01 , so these clicks would produce at least $ 165 billion in revenue .
But the very next paragraph of the InformationWeek article says :
Google earned $ 3.64 billion from U.S. online ad revenues in 2005 , representing 69 % of all paid search advertising , according to eMarketer .
How could they make more than $ 165 billion in December , but only $ 3.64 billion for the year ?
Yet another way to see this is to do one more minute of research .
If you search for [ what is the GDP of the USA ] you see the answer $ 11,750,000,000,000 .
Now search for [ Google " the average cost - per - click is " ] and you 'll see a wide variety of estimates , mostly from $ 0.10 to $ 1.00 .
A front - page article in the Wall Street Journal on 18 Jan. 2006 estimates Google 's average cost - per - click as $ 0.50 .
With that estimate the 16.5 trillion clicks in December translate to $ 8.25 trillion , more than 70 % of the US GDP for the whole year .
That can't be right .
Finally , another report on Nielsen / NetRatings says that " The activity at more than 60 search sites makes up the total search volume upon which percentages are based -- 5.1 billion searches in this month . "
Of these , Google gets a 46.3 % share of the searches .
46.3 % of 5.1 billion is 2.4 billion , so Nielsen / NetRatings ( as quoted by these two reporters ) is saying that each Google search results in 7,000 clicks .
Exercise for the reader : is the Nielsen / NetRatings estimate of 2.4 billion Google searches per month ( which translates to 80 million per day ) accurate ?
Consider research such as [ " million google searches per day " ] and note the year those estimates were made .
[ Addendum , 2008 : ]
This article was originally written in 2006 , but a good example came up in 2008 .
As the United States was debating a $ 700 billion " bailout " plan , we saw many dozens of stories discussing the $ 700 million bailout " .
Factors of 1000 matter !
Why am I making such a big deal about one or two bad numbers ?
To point out that it is so easy to correct these mistakes before they are published if you are willing to do a little thinking rather than just parroting .
Deception in Consumer Marketing and Reporting
The disturbing part about the article is when Atkin says
Riedel 's sales pitch was given independent corroboration last year when Kari Russell , a food science student at the University of Tennessee , published some research into wine glasses .
Her test was comparatively simple .
She poured samples of Merlot into three different shaped glasses ( champagne flute , a Y - shaped martini glass and a broad , but tapered Bordeaux glass ) .
As she did so , she noticed that the concentration of one particular phenol , gallic acid , increased in all three .
Twenty minutes later it had dropped significantly in the Bordeaux glass , producing a rounder wine .
( emphasis mine -- PN )
Was this corroboration ?
Russell showed that gallic acid content changes , but if Atkins had taken the trouble to actually read Russell 's research ( or had talked to her ) , he would have found that her research actually concluded that this change had no measurable effect on taste :
In the second phase of her study , Russell asked a sensory panel , made mostly of students , to sample wine that had been held in different shaped glasses .
While the majority of panelists did n't notice any difference in taste , a professor did seem to be able to taste a difference .
So only one subject ( it does n't say out of how many , but to have any chance at significance you 'd want at least 10 subjects in your study ) claimed he could taste a difference .
But instead of calling the metaphorical wine glass 90 % empty , Atkin ( and several other reporters ) concluded that there was a difference in taste , when they should have concluded that there was not .
This story was cited in Seth Godin 's new book All Marketers Are Liars .
I accept Godin 's premise , but I hope that reporters could be truth - tellers , rather than dupes of the liars .
Unfortunately , it seems that Atkin wanted to believe that he could have a better wine - drinking experience , so he deceived himself into believing Riedel 's pitch and misrepresenting Russell 's research .
Innumeracy in Science Reporting
Shortly thereafter I read another Globe article about an inventor who said it was important to be creative and spontaneous , and that therefore he always started each day by shaving a different side of his face first .
I wrote again to point out that , assuming he has only two sides to his face , that this was no more spontaneous than shaving the same side first every day .
( I did n't know about Kolmogorov complexity at the time , but I had the right idea . )
The Globe ignored me again .
Around 2000 , there was a news report that stated that most men should not be ashamed about the length of their penis , because a scientific study had shown that 95 % of men were within the range of average .
This result was presented as a finding about penis size ( thereby making it newsworthy material ) but in fact it had nothing at all to do with penises , and was merely a restating of the statistical definition that 95 % of data points on a bell curve fall within two standard deviations of the mean .
But I suppose you would n't attract as many readers with the headline " 95 % of data points within two s.d. of mean ! "
( Note : I apologize that I do n't have a link to this news article , but as anyone with any familiarity with the Internet knows , there are a lot of pages mentioning " penis " , and I could n't find the article . )
In a positive development , President Bush stressed math and science education in his 2006 State of the Union address .
Ironically , the Forbes coverage of the speech says that :
Bush proposes to spend $ 5.9 billion in fiscal 2007 on a plan the White House has dubbed the " American Competitiveness Initiative . "
Two - thirds of the money - $ 4.6 billion - would be used to pay for tax credits ...
These examples annoyed me , but I admit they may not be particularly important .
The next example , however , is clearly of great importance to international public policy .
Equal Time in Science Reporting
You 'd always go out and find the two sides of the story .
So never mind there were nine hundred environmentalists -- experts -- who believed in global warming , to every two who did n't .
In a story of four minutes , it almost looked like it was fifty - fifty : " There 's a debate over whether there 's global warming . "
But journalists , in an attempt not to come down on one side , would portray to the audience : " There 's this raging battle over global warming . "
Well , how many [ U.S. ] newspapers even have a science section , other than the New York Times ?
Even if they have a science reporter , they do n't give the reporter much space .
Then there 's this concept of balance that 's framed in such a way as to really enable intellectual superficiality .
Give a quote from each side .
Then you can do the " he said -- she said . "
There 's no sense that it 's the journalist 's job to dig and see if either side has more merit .
At least provide some context .
You can't get that from the media .
The consensus among climate researchers is outlined by the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change :
Human activities ... are modifying the concentration of atmospheric constituents ... that absorb or scatter radiant energy .
Most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations .
The scientists at the briefing said global warming is not as controversial as sometimes portrayed by skeptics .
Those who study the issue agree that human industrial activity is having an impact on climate , they said , and policy makers need to understand the depth of scientific consensus on key issues .
But before calling the game , let 's consider some criticism of Oreskes and its coverage in the press .
In a letter to Science , Social anthropologist Benny Peiser claimed that when he attempted to replicate Oreskes ' study , he found 34 articles that " reject or doubt " the consensus , thereby falsifying Oreskes ' results .
Science chose not to publish the letter , and Peiser claimed bias on the part of Science , and was the subject of sympathetic articles in The Telgraph ( 1 May 2005 ) and CNSNews.com ( 7 Dec. 2004 ) .
Certainly nobody wants to stifle legitimate scientific debate , so was Science wrong to reject the letter ?
Were the Telegraph and CNSNews right to publish these articles ?
My feeling is that it hinges not on whether Peiser is complaining , but on whether he has a legitimate complaint .
It should be the reporter 's job to determine this .
Any reporter could do this with about two hours of work .
That 's what I did : I looked at the evidence myself ( see my separate web page for details ) .
I read 59 scientific article abstracts , and classified them into the categories Oreskes used .
My analysis was consistent with the Oreskes article .
I found that only two of the 34 papers Peiser cites as rejecting the consensus actually do reject it , and that these were both opinion pieces rather than scientific articles ; that 's why they were not included in Oreskes ' study .
Therefore I conclude Science was right to reject Peiser 's letter , and the Telegraph and CNSNews were wrong to print articles on Peiser without critical evaluation .
Update ( June 2007 ) : Peiser has backed off his claims , and now says there is actually only one out of the 34 papers actually rejects the consensus , and that one is an editorial , not a scientific paper .
You might also want to check out another case of " scurrilous parroting " ( their phrase , not mine ) on global warming .

“ Why is New Media becoming popular ? ”
After being introduced to a friend of a friend as a ‘ full time blogger ’ the other night at a pub I was asked the above question by the friend of a friend .
He accepted that ‘ New Media ’ is popular – but was at a bit of a loss as to the reasons for WHY it was .
I answered his question by reflecting upon a number of the things I see happening at present in wider culture and talked about how blogging and other forms of new media seem to be tapping into some of these 9 factors ( I ’m sure there are more than 9 – but these are what came to mind ) .
Just a warning – this is a longish and slightly philosophical post – if you do n’t have time to read it you might like to bookmark it to ponder later .
Also note that much of this comes from a variety of reading I ’ve done on post - modernism and culture , particularly in my reading around new forms of spirituality and why they are emerging :
1. Participation
For many years the way we ’ve interacted with news and knowledge has been in a very one way form .
Our society has had professional experts and news reporters who seek news and knowledge on our behalf and who present it to us for our consumption .
The experts do the work and in a sense the rest of us are quite passive in the process .
This is not cutting it for many these days who not only want to know the latest news or knowledge but instead now want to interact with it and even participate in it .
Expertise and Knowledge is still valued but there seems to be a move towards an understanding that true expertise lies in the collective rather than the individual .
As a result conversation and a sense of belonging is central in many forms of new media .
People want to interact with news and with the rise of technology they want an opportunity to even take part in it ’s creation and reporting .
We see this through blogs , podcasts , the rise in the camera phone in many news stories ( remember the images from the London bombing ? ) etc .
The line between reporters and consumers of news and information has blurred as people participate in media more and more .
2. Suspicion of Institution
Government , Church , Business and other institutions have had an increasingly tough time in recent decades .
Whereas in days gone by ‘ Big ’ was respected and looked to as legitimizing something – I ’m sensing a change and the beginning of a return to the micro .
I ’ve seen this on many levels in recent times ranging from a decline here in Australia of people ’s opinion of the church ( perhaps partly a result of various scandals and failings over the years ) through to a rise of the ‘ inner city village ’ which seems to be happening more and more in different parts of our city as people intentionally decide to shop locally , put their money in community banks and seek alternative lifestyles .
I do n’t have figures to back it up but anecdotal evidence among my friendship groups seems to indicate a growing sense of disillusionment and suspicion of mainstream media outlets also .
Here in Australia most of our media is controlled by a small number of players and there is a lot of talk in the circles that I hang around in about alternatives sources of news – many of them online .
3. Playfulness
Excuse my language but Australians love to ‘ take the piss ’ out of people .
I ’m not sure how that translates into other settings but there is a certain irreverence and playfulness that exists in the way that people interact with one another in daily life .
Childhood seems to extend well into adulthood for many also as they seek to find ways of escaping ‘ the grind ’ and enjoy life .
Video games are played more by adult males than children and gadgets seem to be more about entertainment than productivity or a couple of examples of this .
New media has a playfulness about it in many instances also .
Irreverence , humor and ‘ taking the piss ’ ( especially of institutions ) are all givens in blogging and pod-casting efforts – to the point where almost anything goes .
4. Relationality
( I may have just made up a word ) Perhaps this is just an extension of ‘ participation ’ but I ’ve noticed in the last decade or so ( especially in younger generations ) a change in the air when it comes to individualism .
While there is still a big focus upon looking out for your own best interests ( selfishness frustrates me and I see it everywhere ) there are plenty of indications around that people are thirsting to connect with one another .
Of course the way we connect and have relationships is changing with the rise in different technologies that allow cheap and easy connections across vast distances – but the desire to belong to communities of like minded people remains ( and is perhaps growing ) .
As I ’ve said above – new media is at its best when it involves conversations , collective learning and being a part of things that are bigger than just yourself .
This is one of the main reasons I got into blogging three years ago – the day I discovered blogs I was sucked into the conversations I saw happening on topics that meant something to me – I ’ve never looked back .
5. Holism
The world used to split life in segments .
We had work lives , home lives , sex lives , spiritual lives , social lives , dating lives etc etc etc .
In recent years there has been a return to a more holistic and integrated lifestyle .
Rather than compartmentalizing there is a desire among many to integrate and connect these once fractured aspects of our existence .
New Media can buy into this compartmentalized world view but I wonder with the advent of tools like news aggregators whether we ’re starting to see people controlling and integrating their different interests into the one place .
ie now in the same tool I can get the latest gadget news , read a soap gossip column , check out the latest Bollywood news , get news of my football club ’s latest fundraiser , hear about a great new way to cook biscotti from an Italian chef and find out tips on how to get rid of that annoying rash !
While Web 2.0 gets a lot of criticism – many of the tools being developed in it at present will take this holistic / integrated thing a lot further as we see the convergence of aspects of life that we ’d never would have dreamed of .
6. Juxtaposition
Perhaps this is a generational thing ( I suspect it ’s not ) or maybe it ’s just me growing up ( it had to happen eventually ) – but does n’t the world seem a lot less black and white ?
While I used to want ‘ the answer ’ or ‘ the information ’ and did n’t want to hear different opinions or ideas that might clash with one another – these days I seek out juxtaposition and paradox in my life .
People seem increasingly comfortable with hearing diverse opinions and living with contradiction .
I see this in many of my friends ( and if I ’m honest my own life ) where people hold strong values that quite often contradict the decisions that they make ( perhaps a better word is hypocrisy ? ) .
I met one person who embodied this a few months ago .
She told me that she was grappling with the fact that she was really passionate about social justice and advocating for the poor ( she does ALOT of volunteer work for different organizations ) yet she has just bought herself a $ 15,000 fridge .
She could n’t make sense of her decision but had this strange sense of being ok with it even though it did n’t quite seem to fit .
As New Media and Web 2.0 moves towards convergence and integration ( see last point on holism ) I guess we will increasingly see a juxtaposition of ideas side by side .
7. DIY
I was in a hardware shop the other day and noticed an area that was set up with around 50 chairs all set up like a meeting was about to happen .
I asked what was going on and was told that it was their ‘ learning centre ’ where they ran classes on how to do various maintenance jobs around the house .
They ran over 30 classes a week and were booked out for at least a month .
‘ Do it Yourself ’ TV shows and magazines are pretty massive here in Australia ( almost to the point where a year or so back it felt like there was little else on TV ) .
People increasingly seem to be feeling empowered to do things that they ’d previously have paid an expert to do for them .
It ’s not wonder that thousands of people around the world are looking at what they see on TV , radio , magazines and newspapers and are deciding that they could do that themselves .
I heard of one Melbourne teenager who was listening to dance music one day a few years ago and decided that he could produce similar kinds of sounds on his PC .
He ’d never really done anything like that before but after looking at some websites that told him what to do and after downloading some software he put together a number of tracks that he promptly posted on a music website .
Six months later he was being played in London clubs .
He was just a kid messing around in his bedroom one day and what everyone thought was the coolest artist the next .
New Media is making kids ( sometimes grown up ones ) famous ( in their niches ) all over the world .
8. Immediacy
Last week I was in a food court and saw a woman completely loose it because the McDonalds staff were not able to get her a cheese burger and fries in the 60 seconds that she wanted it in .
She was told there ’d be a three minute wait and she threw a tantrum as a result .
I laughed at the situation at the time but when I came home and my laptop took a few seconds longer to start up than normal and I began to wonder if it was time for an upgrade I realized that we ’re all much the same .
We want ‘ stuff ’ now !
Waiting is not part of the equation any more .
Now I ’m not saying that this need for everything to be immediate is a good thing ( I think we need to slow down ) but one of the reasons I think new media is appealing to people is that it ’s very fast .
This hit home to me when I was online the day that the London bombings happened last year and when I saw read first hand reports and saw pictures from within the subway within minutes of the incidents happening .
Just yesterday Steve Rubel proudly proclaimed that bloggers had the story of Gmail being down before the press did .
New Media is light footed , nimble and quick – so much so that many mainstream news sources just cannot compete any more .
I notice this most with a couple of Monthly magazines and periodicals that I subscribe to – I do n’t remember the last time when they broke a story to me that I ’d not read about within hours of the announcements being made .

But last week it was reported that China 's richest billionaire is now a woman - 49 - year - old Zhang Yin is worth a cool $ 3.4bn ( £ 1.8 bn ) .
The tycoon is the world 's richest self - made woman , having built China 's largest paper recycling business , Nine Dragons Paper , which was floated on the Hong Kong stock market just six months ago .
She seems an eloquent symbol of the new China ; a capitalist whose success and wealth was unthinkable before Deng Xiaoping freed China from the embrace of Maoism in 1978 .
It is capitalists such as her who are proof that paradoxically it is communist China that is home to the globe 's most vigorous capitalism .
And she is a woman .
In China , though , beware .
Nothing is quite what it seems .
Zhang
Yin owes her success both to pro-market Deng Xiaoping and ardent communist Mao .
As the eldest daughter of a family with eight children , her expectation before the communist revolution would have been to grow up illiterate before becoming her husband 's chattel .
Mao 's radical egalitarianism may have given China the murderous mayhem of the Cultural Revolution .
But he also transformed the role , expectations and education of women .
In 1949 female illiteracy in rural China was 99 per cent .
In 1976 when Mao died it was 45 per cent and today it is 13 per cent .
One of Mao's first acts was to give women the same rights in divorce as men , and for all his other barbarism he consistently championed the equality of women .
China is still a sexist society , but compared with the rest of Asia it is light years ahead .
Female illiteracy in rural India , for example , is still 55 per cent .
The change has gone deep into the marrow of Chinese society .
One survey recently revealed that Chinese girls between 16 and 19 name becoming president , chief executive or senior manager of a company as their top career choices ; Japanese girls between 16 and 19 say they want to become housewives , flight attendants or child - care workers .
One of China 's most formidable economic and social resources has become its women .
As the daughter of an officer in the People 's Liberation Army , Zhang Yin also understands the corrupt and controlling pathology of Chinese communism well - and has understood the imperative to keep ownership and direction of her company as distant as possible from Beijing .
In China the party controls , or has the capacity to control , everything ; the number of companies forced into decline or even bankruptcy because they were compelled to support party aims - bailing out an endemically loss - making company to protect jobs or buying a state - owned company at an astronomic price to feather the nest of a senior official - is beyond counting .
Indigenous Chinese capitalism is a form of hit - and - run guerrilla economic warfare in a constant battle with the world 's greediest and most corrupt officialdom .
Survival depends upon paying tribute .
It is no accident that two thirds of China 's six million private businesses are owned and run by ex-communist officials .
Almost every private businessperson in China is either a party member or applying to join .
Zhang has avoided much of that - courtesy of Hong Kong , a Taiwanese husband and managing to get out of China in the months after Tiananmen Square when repression was at its height and the prospects for any kind of private enterprise seemed nil .
Her cleverest moves were her first ; incorporating her company in Hong Kong in 1985 and then marrying a Taiwanese with a non Chinese passport .
In exile in Los Angeles in 1990 the pair founded America Chung Nam - a company specialising in scrap paper brokerage as she had been doing in Hong Kong .
Scrap paper is one of the few industries the party considers non-strategic and which it indulges - another smart choice for an ambitious woman .
In December 1991 the Soviet Union collapsed , and in January 1992 the ageing Deng Xiaoping declared in a tour of Guangdong , China 's most pro-capitalist province , that as international communism was dead the only way for Chinese communism to survive was to embrace pro-market reform .
In particular it should welcome inward investment from foreign companies with know - how and technology .
It was glorious , he said , to be rich .
There was an avalanche of inward investment , including America Chung Nam building a paper and board mill in the very same Guangdong - a foreign investor even if owned by a Chinese living abroad .
After all , China 's booming exports would need to be wrapped in paper and paperboard .
Guangdong 's exports have grown phenomenally ; so have sales of paper and board .
And six months ago Zhang Yin and her husband cashed in - floating their shares not in one of China 's stock markets on the mainland , but in Hong Kong .
Here a private company can keep its distance from the party ; if there is a dispute with the communists it gets settled in Hong Kong 's still independent legal system - legacy of the British - and not in one of the mainland 's rigged courts .
The extent of China 's reform , and its subsequent growth , is stunning .
It is also true that Ms Zhang could not have made her money if China had not opened to the world .
But nobody should believe that somehow her fortune means that China has made the full transition to capitalism .
Rather she has exploited the system 's fault lines .
This remains a one - party state , in which every institution - from the media to its companies - is constructed to sustain its monopoly of power .
Entrepreneurs such as Zhang
Yin only succeed if they find ways around the system ; they can only push the economy so far .
One day the party will have to let go properly .
The issues are only how and when .

My flip flops are the dirtiest things I ’ve ever worn continuously .
My barefoot lifestyle has left its mark–literally , in the form of a large , foot - shaped print ( complete with toes ! ) –on the shoes from when I slip them on after , say , walking through Boston barefoot or wandering around a party for six hours .
But really , it ’s not all my fault –I wanted black ones , but they only had white ones , and 5.99 - emergency - flipflop - buyers ca n’t be choosers , I guess .
But that ’s not what I ’m talking about in the title .
A few days ago , AOL publicly released all of its users ’ search data .
Yeowch .
Everyone immediately jumped on this and sad BAD , BAD , BAD , BAD idea AOL !
How dare you violate the privacy of your users in such a careless way , who will trust you again , and OH GOD THOSE POOR PEOPLE !
AOL , of course , took it down quickly and started pointing fingers like there ’s no tomorrow , and all of the very valid statements above only get stronger in the aftermath of the issue …
Oh yeah , except that “ those poor people ” part .
Within two days , while still calling AOL foolish and irresponsible , those who were quick enough to download the search data have put it back up online .
In several places , in fact .
Wait wait wait wait WAIT .
What happened to privacy concerns ?
Privacy rights ?
AOL tries to clean up its act , and then YOU guys continue the wrong ?
And really , I think it ’s even worse than AOL did .
For example , one of the mirror sites for the data includes the comment “ User # ## is a perv ! ” on its front page .
How is this any more morally right or even mature than a middle school bully stealing an embarrassing note and reading it to the class ?
Internet community , are we really no better than this ?
The worst part , the part that inspired me to blog about this , is the fact that there is no outrage over this second round of privacy violations .
None .
In fact , people seem to think it ’s completely okay and maybe even CREATIVE to exploit the information .
Check THIS out : this writer posts an excerpt on his blog and invites speculation .
He even touches on the decency of his action , and then comes to a really sound conclusion …
“ It ’s doubtful user ## ## ever intended these queries for publication .
But AOL ’s decision to make the data available , despite subsequently removing the files , seems to render the issue of privacy moot .
The files remain available online at sites like dontdelete.com .
Having looked over the entries and found nothing really damning or invasive , I feel comfortable republishing this one user ’s queries . ”
WHAAAT ?
Excuse me ?
Because AOL messed up , it means no one else is responsible and the issue of privacy is moot ?
That ’s like saying everyone can pollute because some guy threw the first gum wrapper .
Also , his reassurance that he found “ nothing really damning or invasive ” is naive and patronizing .
How is that different from someone reassuring you that yes , he may have found your crime record and put it online , but it ’s okay because he did n’t find any major felonies ?
What is or is not damning or invasive should be up to the person , and an invader making that judgment call is completely hypocritical .
That is n’t it , though .
Look at the reports from Wired .
Two very different things happen on the same page .
First , “ This is a blatant violation of users ’ privacy . ”
Then , further down on the page , “ Whoever wrote that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned had clearly never experienced the Internet .
For a three - month period , AOL user #### , apparently a resident of the greater Boston area , was searching for little else . ”
Bwa ?
Did we just decide that decency was n’t worth combing through the searches and finding people with sad lives to make fun of ?
So anyway , here ’s my request .
Reporters , stop using the “ there is SO much you can find with this dangerous dangerous data , and to prove it we ’re going to give you a bunch of really entertaining examples ” excuse to exploit the data .
Even if no one in the general public figures out the precise identity of the person , it makes it embarrassing for them , it could get them in trouble with people they are close to , and POSTING THE LINKS on which the mirrors are located just encourages more people to go have fun with people ’s privacy .
Blogs and news aggregators : please STOP posting the links to the mirrored sites and stop encouraging people to dig up interesting stories .
Mirror sites :
Take that shit down .
Even AOHELL had the decency to .
Summary :
AOL : Put up the data
Blogosphere : Put up the data ( in multiple places , after it was taken down ) , mocked the users in them , wrote up cute little embarrassing reports for some of the data , all while insulting AOL .
Flip - flopping on important stuff like privacy concerns : Priceless .
P.S. What the hell does “ whoever wrote that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned … a resident of the greater Boston area was searching for little else ” mean ANYWAY ?
Israeli governmentÂ public relations encountered a significant challenge today when the IDFÂ killed dozens of children in the same location that they killed more than a hundred civilians a decade ago .
Â Â
The fact that both attacks occurred in Qana , Lebanon is the sort of thing that might make even a newspaper correspondent look into Israel ’s prior history of wreaking carnage on the Lebanese .
( The discussion of Qana from my 2003 Terrorism & Tyranny is posted below ) .
One point that few people are making : Â George W. Bush and the U.S. Congress bear some of the responsiblity for the 500 +
Lebanese civilians who have thus far been killed by the Israeli Defense Force .
Â
The House voted 411 to 8 to cheer on Israel after the IDF ’s attacks began , and congressmen sneered at efforts to get any substantive complaint about civilian casualties in the pro-Israel resolution .
Â
And Bush gave his blessings to the IDF even after the Israeli Justice Minister Haim Ramon announced on Israeli Army radio last Wednesday that â€ œAll those now in south Lebanon are terrorists who are related in some way to Hezbollah . ” Â Â
When you see the photos of corpses of youngÂ children being dragged from the Qana rubble , remember : Â
These are not human beings .
Â
These are terrorists .
Â
And Israel announced ahead of time that , because they were in south Lebanon , they were legitimate targets .
Â Â
From Terrorism & Tyranny ( 2003 ) :
On April 18 , 1996 the IDF artillery shelled a United Nations compound near Qana that was overflowing with 800 Lebanese civilians â€ œwho had fled from their villages on IDF orders.â€ 
The barrage killed 102 refugees and wounded hundreds of others .
Hezbollah guerillas had fired Katyusha rockets a few hundred yards from the compound .
A spokesman for United Nations forces in Lebanon quickly denounced the attack as a â€œmassacre.â€  Maj .
Gen . Dan Harel , the commander of the Israeli offensive , insisted that the shelling of the camp could not possibly have been deliberate because â€ œthat thing cannot happen in a democratic country like Israel.â€ 
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres declared that â€ œthe sole guilty party , still on the ground , is Hezbollah .
. . .
We are dealing here with a horrible , cynical and irresponsible organization .
Hezbollahâ€™s grand strategy all along has been to hide behind the backs of civilians .
â€ 
A United Nations investigation concluded that â€œit is unlikely that the shelling of the United Nations compound was the result of gross technical and / or procedural errors.â€ 
The IDF insisted that it was unaware that the camp was chock full of refugees ; the UN report retorted : â€ œContrary to repeated denials , two Israeli helicopters
and a remotely piloted vehicle [ drone ] were present in the Qana area at the timeÂ of the shelling .
â€ 
An Amnesty International report concluded that the IDF â€œintentionally
attacked the UN compound .â€ 
A few weeks after the attack , two of the Israeli gunners involved in the shelling were interviewed by a Jerusalem newsweekly .
One of the gunners commented : â€ œIn a war , these things happen .
. . .
Itâ€™s just a bunch of Arabs.â€ 
A second gunner said that , after bombarding the refugee camp , a commander told the gunners that â€œwe were shooting well and to continue this way and that Arabs , you know , there are millions of them .â€
Haaretz columnist Ari Shavit , who had fought at Qana 18 years earlier while serving in the IDF , observed : â€ œAn Israeli massacre can be distinguished in most respects from an Arab massacre in that it is not malicious , not carried out on orders from High Above and does not serve any strategic purpose .
. . .
An Israeli massacre usually occurs after we sanction an unjustifiable degree of violence so that at some point we lose the ability to control that violence .
Thus , in most cases , an Israeli massacre is a kind of work accident.â€ 
[ As I noted in my first blog on this subject , Hezbollah is also guilty ofÂ murder for its missile attacks on Israeli civilians .
Â
Neither side in this conflict is exonerated by the other side ’s methods or goals . ]

Social Phishing Harald Taglinger
Die dunklen Möglichkeiten der Social Software - ein Szenario
Nur einmal angenommen : die Web 2.0 - Welle schwappt nachhaltig über den grossen Teich .
Und angenommen , die „ Wisdom of crowd “ baut auch weiterhin auf dem Vertrauen auf , dass jeder von uns allezeit seinen Namen in Social Networks und Swarming Tools kontrollieren kann .
Dann verdichten sich das Profil eines Users und seine soialen Zeichen im Netz .
Angenommen das reizt einzelne zum Spiel und Misbrauch , denn diese Kontrolle ist ein Irrglaube .
Wie sähe es aus , in das soziale Gefüge eines ausgesuchten Opfers einzudringen ?
In einem Redaktionsbüro des BURDA Verlages war 1995 viel Spaß mit AOL - Accounts zu haben .
Die Redakteure drangen im Rudel in einen Chatraum des eben neu auf den Markt gekommenen Datendienstes ein und blödelten einen harmlosen User an .
Na endlich , das sei doch der Schweinehund , der der Schwester ein Kind gemacht habe – was dieser online bestritt .
Genau , und bei einer anderen habe er das auch versucht – auch das wurde bestritten .
Und wahrscheinlich sei er gerade in diesem Chatraum wieder auf der Jagd - der wehrlose AOL - User verschwand .
Dass sich fünf in einem Raum unter verschiedenen Accounts angemeldet hatten und die soziale Glaubwürdigkeit eines anderen untergruben , konnte man damals in die Rubrik „ pubertäre Fingerübungen mit einem neuen Medium “ einordnen .
Chaträume gelten und galten zudem als Spielwiese , die sich auch ohne Gegenwehr als Interviewplatz misbrauchen liessen .
Heute sind wir zehn Jahre weiter .
Social Pishing , so das Gedankenexperiment würde ein wenig mehr Vorbereitung brauchen , aber die Effekte wären durchschlagender .
Denn soziale Duftmarken im Netz zu hinterlassen , ist weitaus anerkannter als noch Mitte der 90er .
Damit auch glaubwürdiger .
Nehmen wir einfach an , dass eines schönen
Tages einer beschliesst , die ewigen Mails über Gates , der wieder einmal sein Vermögen verschenkt , seien ein wenig langweilig geworden .
Nehmen wir weiterhin an , dass ihm ein wenig Zeit zur Verfügung steht und er über Web Two Point Oh einen geeigneten Namen und eine Fake - Website aufbaut , die offiziell eine Beta dieser Web 2.0 - Anwendung anbietet .
Darauf ist zu lesen , dass diese wunderbare Applikation bald live sein wird .
Man solle sich hier anmelden , dann bekomme man einen der wenigen Accounts zu diesem sensationellen Tool .
Mail und Passwort reichen .
Also das unseriöse
Me too von Marketing - Innovationen , wie sie das Haus Google gerne in die Welt setzt .
Er lässt ein paar Wochen verstreichen und sammelt die hereinkommenden Bewerbungen .
Wenn er sehr viel Mühe verwenden will , dann setzt er so noch weitere Sites auf ( und die werden später einfach wieder verschwinden ) .
Der Anteil derer , die sich bei vielen solcher aufsprießenden Projekte mit immer dem gleichen Account und den gleichen Passwörtern anmelden , wird sicher nicht 100 % sein , aber ein paar heillos Gutgläubige werden sich finden lassen .
Und ein einfacher Blick in die Datenbank , ein Test bei bekannteren Anwendungen wie z.B.
Flickr wird zeigen , ob es sich bei den Kandidaten um solche handelt , die gerne immer wieder die gleichen Zugangscodes nutzen .
Bei den vielen Gelegenheiten zu Accounts und personalisierten Contents denkt sich doch nicht jeder immer neue Passwörter aus .
Nach weiteren Tagen des Testens finden sich ein halbes Dutzend Gutgläubiger , die auch in anderen Anwendungen gleiche Zugangsdaten nutzen und nicht wissen , dass ein Pisher sich testweise bereits Zugang zu verschiedenen Shared Contents des Opfers besorgt hat .
An einem Wochenende schlägt er zu und ändert , verdeckt an zuerst unauffälligen Stellen , die Inhalte und Angaben , die sich auf diversen Servern befinden .
Nach und nach wandelt sich so das Bild eines lustigen Hobbyfotografen und Bloggers in das eines Spinners mit zweifelhaften Vorlieben .
Weil das Opfer auch noch über das Netz von seinem kommenden Urlaub gesprochen hat , merkt es sicher in den nächsten Wochen nichts vom Missbrauch und kann nicht glauben , wie sich bestehende Inhalte nach seiner Rückkehr verändert haben .
Schnell versucht er , den alten Zustand wieder herzustellen .
Aber das Passwort hat sich verändert und verweigert den Zugang .
Neue Inhalte unter seinem Namen tauchen auf .
Google crawled diese Contents , und weil die Suchmaschine laut Aussage von Marissa Mayer , President Search Products & User Experience , Google auf den DLD06 nicht einzelne User und deren Contents aus dem Cache löscht , ist dieser nun gebranntmarkt .
Eine Anzeige wegen faschistischer und pornografischer Inhalte geht ein und bringt polizeiliche Recherche , auch auf dem PC beim Arbeitgeber , in Gang .
Die Familie wird Zeuge eines sich verzweifelt wehrenden Ehemanns , der – JA – die Strandfotos auf Flickr veröffentlicht hatte , aber doch nicht unter dem gleichen Account diese Schweinereien .
Das soziale Ansehen in seinem Umfeld kippt , wer glaubt ihm jetzt ?
Die Geschichte lässt sich weiter spinnen .
Sie ist übertrieben .
Aber sie ist nicht unmöglich .
Abgesehen von eher suboptimalen Versuchen durch Passport ( Microsoft ) hat es wenige Initiativen gegeben , Passwörter klar an die reale Identität zu binden .
Und andere Authentifizierungsmechanismen wird es dank der Verspätung von modernen Betriebssystemen für den Markt auch lange nicht geben .
Aber kaum eine Web 2.0 - Anwendung kommt ohne Anmeldung von Accounts aus und baut damit diese Lücke im täglichen Umgang ein .
Umsichtig vorgehende
User werden sich mit diversen Angeben zu Tode verwalten , statt amüsieren .
Schlamper laufen Gefahr , in ein solches Szenario zu geraten , das hier nur durchdacht , aber bisher noch nicht in der Breite zur Anwendung kam .
Was auf den ersten Blick so unrealistisch scheint , hat die gleichen Motive wie ein Virus , der einen gesamten Datenbestand vernichten kann .
Lust am Machbaren .
Distanz zu den Opfern , Hacker - Ästhetik .
Neu ist dabei , dass solche Szenarien dank weiter Verbreitung von Social Software nun auch Peer to Peer möglich sind und nicht mehr einen übermächtigen Staat brauchen , der das Leben eines Bürgers binnen 12 Stunden zur Hölle macht .
Ein kleiner Scherzkeks mit der entsprechenden Motivation Daten - Stalking zu betreiben reicht .
Theoretisch .
( Harald Taglinger )
The explosive growth of wireless technologies in recent years has brought the IT world to a new , cableless era , where people can walk around their office and from one business location to another , without loosing connectivity to their network .
The same goes for home users : they can now roam around their house with their laptop and surf the web in all liberty .
The increasing popularity of wireless APs is rapidly saturating the air with RF signals , and this brings a new question to life :
Should we be concerned about the effect of RFs on our health ?
Up to now , the safe limit of exposition to radio frequencies for human beings remains pretty much unknown .
The studies have shown that there is no evidence that these signals present a hazard to people .
" Research on the possible health effects of exposure to radiofrequency ( RF ) energy dates back more than 60 years and will continue for the foreseeable future .
As research adds to the extensive scientific knowledge in this important area , we believe it will further strengthen the basis for public confidence in the safety of current and future wireless communications technologies . "
One thing that I know for sure is that these signals gives awful headaches when you work in a wireless lab where three or four access points are broadcasting at the same time on different channels .
I 've also heard many stories about people who had their desk located directly under a broadcasting antenna and whom had terrible migraines at the end each day .
Here are a few recommendations to follow if you want remain on the safe side :
Do n't stand in close proximity to any antenna that is transmitting .
Those that are only made to receive signals are perfectly safe .
If an antenna is a directional one , it is safe for you to stay in the back or on the side of it .
Do n't move a device that is transmitting .
Do n't touch any powered antenna .
To comply with FCC RF exposure limits , dipole antennas ( rubber ducky ones , like on most home wireless routers ) should always be located at least 8 inches from any person .
When using a laptop with a PCMCIA or integrated wireless NIC , the adaptor 's integrated antenna should always be at more then 2 inches from the body of the operator .
If you want to learn more about this interesting subject , I would strongly suggest that you visit the radio frequency safety section of the FCC website .

The US and the tiny island nation of Antigua have been fighting it out in the WTO over online gambling laws for quite some time .
It started years ago , with the US trying to go after someone for setting up an online gambling operation in Antigua .
The US government , of course , is no fan of online gambling -- even though it 's legal in large parts of the world .
Things got ugly three years ago , when Antigua went to the WTO to protest the US 's actions , noting that it appeared to violate a fair - trade agreement both countries had signed -- especially since the US does allow some forms of domestic online gambling .
The WTO agreed with Antigua that the US was violating the agreement -- a decision we noted the US was likely to ignore completely .
Indeed , that 's exactly what they did , so Antigua went back to the WTO , who once again ruled in favor of Antigua ... though , amusingly , the US still claimed victory and then proceeded to ignore the ruling anyway .
According to the ruling , the US had until today to change its laws to reflect a more fair outcome -- something the US said it would do , but which it has shown no signs of actually following through on .
So , what 's a small country like Antigua to do ?
Normally , they could place trade sanctions on the US -- but that 's likely to hurt Antigua a lot more than the US .
Another option that 's being discussed , apparently , is that Antigua would stop enforcing US trademarks and patents , allowing manufacturers in that country to start making knockoff goods .
It 's definitely an interesting retaliation strategy , but Jerry Brito takes the argument one step further , suggesting that an even more compelling move might be to allow the creation of online music services that have been banned in the US , such as the original Napster or my .
MP3.com .
Or , at the very least , an online music store like AllofMP3.com that currently exists in a legal gray area over in Russia .
That , clearly , could get the attention of politicians in the US , since they seem so tuned into the " concerns " of the entertainment industry these days .
No matter what , though , it seems like this could be an interesting strategy for any country involved in a trade dispute with the US .
In the past , we 've seen Brazil use intellectual property enforcement as a weapon in trade disputes .
However , using it as an offensive weapon to allow such products ( especially digital ones ) back into the US could be seen as a very powerful tool in such disputes and could lead to some challenges for the entertainment industry .
Imagine every country that has a trade dispute with the US simply setting up servers upon servers of downloadable music and movies .
Of course , if the industry learned how to embrace file sharing with alternative business models , this entire " threat " could disappear overnight .
Somehow , that seems unlikely -- and , instead , we'd be subjected to commercials warning everyone that downloading from such sites helped our enemies .

Galapagos species inspired Darwin's theory of evolution
Despite inspections of incoming ships and planes , local people recently found an iguana and a turtle which probably came from mainland South America .
Invasive foreign species are one of the main threats to the islands ' wildlife .
This includes giant tortoises , marine iguanas and finches which enchanted naturalist Charles Darwin and helped him develop his theory of evolution .
It is the isolation of the Galapagos Islands which makes their ecology unique .
Stranded 1,000 km ( 620 miles ) off the Ecuadorean coast , animals adapted to the conditions in their particular part of the archipelago without external influences .
Development challenge
Now , though , the isolation of the Galapagos is threatened by foreign species .
The archipelago is home to fishermen , a booming tourist industry and a growing number of migrants from the mainland .
Development has gone hand - in - hand with the arrival of foreign tortoises , turtles and even a monkey .
Officials are particularly worried about the newly discovered iguana which is probably a type which breeds rapidly and could compete with the indigenous varieties .
It almost certainly arrived in cargo and was missed by inspectors .
Other foreign animals in the Galapagos were introduced deliberately , only for their disastrous impact to be appreciated too late .
Naturalists are working to eradicate thousands of feral goats which are a direct threat to the habitat of the Galapagos ' giant tortoises .

One like this :
As early as May 2003 , France 's famed antiterrorist investigating judge , Jean - Louis Bruguière , warned that European terrorist networks were trying to recruit Caucasian women to handle terrorist logistics because they would be less likely to raise suspicion .
He said then that it was only a matter of time before the women moved on to more violent acts .
Ms. Degauque was born in the small suburb of Charleroi , a gritty coal and steel town where her father operated a crane at the sprawling smelter , according to neighbors and friends .
She grew up doted on by her mother , Liliane , who worked as a cleaner and monitor at the local elementary school .
" Her mother spoiled her , " said Jeannine Beghin , who has known Ms. Degauque 's mother since childhood .
Ms. Beghin recalled that Ms. Degauque 's mother rented out a hall and gave a catered party with music and dancing to celebrate the daughter 's first communion .
" Muriel had the prettiest dress of all the girls , " Ms. Beghin said .
Her teachers remember her as a well - dressed , well - behaved young woman , even if she was a middling student .
" Muriel was more literary than scientific , " said Rita Detraux , a retired high school teacher .
Still , Ms. Degauque seemed adrift by the time she took an apprenticeship as a sales clerk at a bakery in Charleroi after her third year of high school .
The local press has quoted her former boss as saying that Ms. Degauque would disappear at lunchtime , and that he soon learned she was using drugs .
Talk that Ms. Degauque had fallen into the wrong crowd soon circulated in the neighborhood .
The Belgian Police say she became known as a drug user , though she was never arrested .
In her late teens , she followed her older brother in joining a local motorcycle club , the Apaches , and neighbors saw her come and go in a black leather jacket on the back of a boyfriend 's motorcycle .
By most accounts , Ms. Degauque 's wayward streak took a decisive turn when her brother was killed in a motorcycle accident when she was 20 .
He had always been the more popular of the two , people who know the family say .
One neighbor , Andrea Dorange , has told local newspapers that Ms. Degauque said she should have died instead of her brother .

The " goto " module was an April Fool 's joke , published on 1st April 2004 .
Yes , it works , but it 's a joke nevertheless .
Please do n't use it in real code !
goto for Python
Adds the ' goto ' and ' comefrom ' keywords to Python .
The ' goto ' and ' comefrom ' keywords add flexibility to Python 's control flow mechanisms , and allow Python programmers to use many common control flow idioms that were previously denied to them .
Some examples are given below .
To enable the new keywords , add the following line to the top of your code :
from goto import goto , comefrom , label
goto
' goto ' jumps the program execution directly to another line of code .
The target line must be identified using a ' label ' statement .
Labels are defined using the ' label ' keyword , and have names which are arbitrary Python identifiers prefixed with a single dot , like this :
label .
myLabel
To jump to a label , use the ' goto ' keyword like this :
goto .
myLabel
Computed goto
You can use a computed goto by assigning the name of the label to a variable at runtime and referencing it using an asterisk like this :
x = calculateLabelName ( ) goto * x
The value of ' x ' should not include the leading dot .
See Example 5 below for a full example .
comefrom
' comefrom ' is the opposite of ' goto ' .
It allows a piece of code to say " Whenever label X is reached , jump to here instead . "
For example :
# ... code 1 ... label .
somewhere # ... code 2 ... comefrom .
somewhere
Here , " code 2 " will not run - execution will jump directly from the " label .somewhere " line to the " comefrom .somewhere " line .
' comefrom ' is typically used as a debugging aid - its use in production code is discouraged since it can lead to surprising behaviour .
Restrictions
There are some classes of goto and comefrom which would be unpythonic , and hence there are some restrictions on where jumps can go :
No jumping between modules or functions
No jumping into the middle of a loop or a ' finally ' clause
No jumping onto an ' except ' line ( because there is no exception )
Examples
Here are some examples of how goto and comefrom can be used :
# Example 1 : Breaking out from a deeply nested loop : from goto import goto , label for i in range ( 1 , 10 ) : for j in range ( 1 , 20 ) : for k in range ( 1 , 30 ) : print i , j , k if k == 3 : goto .
end label .
end print " Finished
" # Example 2 : Restarting a loop : from goto import goto , label label .
start for i in range ( 1 , 4 ) : print i if i == 2 : try : output = message except NameError : print " Oops - forgot to define ' message ' !
Start again . " message = " Hello world " goto .
start print output , "
" # Example 3 : Cleaning up after something fails : from goto import goto , label # Imagine that these are real worker functions .
def setUp ( ) : print " setUp " def doFirstTask ( ) : print 1 ; return True def doSecondTask ( ) : print 2 ; return True def doThirdTask ( ) : print 3 ; return False #
This one pretends to fail .
def doFourthTask ( ) : print 4 ; return True def cleanUp ( ) : print " cleanUp " #
This prints " setUp , 1 , 2 , 3 , cleanUp " - no " 4 " because doThirdTask fails .
def bigFunction1 ( ) : setUp ( ) if not doFirstTask ( ) : goto .
cleanup if not doSecondTask ( ) : goto .
cleanup if not doThirdTask ( ) : goto .
cleanup if not doFourthTask ( ) : goto .
cleanup label .
cleanup cleanUp ( ) bigFunction1 ( ) print " bigFunction1 done
" # Example 4 : Using comefrom to let the cleanup code take control itself .
from goto import comefrom , label def bigFunction2 ( ) : setUp ( ) if not doFirstTask ( ) : label .
failed if not doSecondTask ( ) : label .
failed if not doThirdTask ( ) : label .
failed if not doFourthTask ( ) : label .
failed comefrom .
failed cleanUp ( ) bigFunction2 ( ) print " bigFunction2 done
" # Example 5 : Using a computed goto : from goto import goto , label label .
getinput i = raw_input ( " Enter either ' a ' , ' b ' or ' c ' , or any other letter to quit : " ) if i in ( ' a ' , ' b ' , ' c ' ) : goto * i else : goto .
quit label .
a print " You typed ' a ' " goto .
getinput label .
b print " You typed ' b ' " goto .
getinput label .
c print " You typed ' c ' " goto .
getinput label .
quit print " Finished
" # Example 6 : What happens when a label is missing : from goto import goto , label label .
real goto .
unreal # Raises a MissingLabelError exception .

SA 2004 - 09 - 16 : hi salvatore - in case you have n't been following the concatenative mail group , there 's a general call out for short articles on the different cl's .
manfred posted the following note this morning :
If you can read this , Salvatore , would you be interested to write a contribution to the joint paper about concatenative languages that we are writing ?
Your implementation seems to be significantly different from others , and your contribution to the paper would be most welcome .

SS 2004 -02 - 10 : I used the last weekend to implement Joy in Tcl .
It 's not very fast of course , and still not complete , but does tail call optimization , has first class continuations , and is stackless ( The interpreter never call itself ) , so it 's simple to transfer an entire running program from an interpreter to another one .
Changelog
2004-02-11
Now the implementation is a superset of Joy , that I called ' Apathy ' .
It 's basically Joy with locals designed to do n't break the Joy semantics .
Now Joy primitives are implemented in Apathy and there are more primitives .
Too big to put it here on the Wiki , so download it from http://www.hping.org/tclsbignum/joy.tcl if you are interested .
Run it with
tclsh joy.tcl
to use the interactive mode , or pass an file name to execute a program written in Joy .
As stated , it 's still not finished .
Many primitives are missing , but can easily implemented in Joy itself .
Also note that currently the ' set ' data type is missing .
Btw it is able to run this ( From the Joy tutorial ) :
DEFINE permlist == [ small ] [ unitlist ] [ uncons ] [ swap [ swons [ small ] [ unitlist ] [ dup unswons [ uncons ] dip swons ] [ swap [ swons ] cons map cons ] linrec ] cons map [ null ] [ ] [ uncons ] [ concat ] linrec ] linrec . [ 1 2 3 4 5 ] permlist
Use the help command to print a list of the defined words .
Currently the following are defined :
{} != * + - . / < <= = > >= and at auxpop auxpush body branch callcc character concat cons continue dip dup dupd exit first float help i ifte integer intern linrec list local map newstack not null or pairlist pairstring pop popd pred primrec put putchars rem rest ret rolldown rollup rotate second size small stack stacktrace step string succ swap swapd swons tailrec tclrepr third times truth uncons uncons2 unconsd unitlist unitstring unpair unstack unswons unswons2 while xor y
I plan to have a fully compatible interpreter in some day .

George Lucas has been working on the fourth Indiana Jones
He told BBC Radio 1 the writing team would soon be meeting to start on the project , which would begin filming in 2008 and be ready the same year .
" Hopefully if we can make it work and everybody 's excited and watches it we will keep on going , " said McCallum .
The series will be set between episodes three and four of the film saga .
It would cover the 20 years in the life of Luke Skywalker growing up that remains a mystery to most film - goers .
McCallum said there would be " a whole bunch of new characters " and the series would be " much more dramatic and darker " .
Huge franchise
He added that it was unlikely any of the stars of the movies would be involved in the TV series .
Star Wars creator George Lucas has just completed writing the script for the next Indiana Jones film and will then begin work on Red Tails , about African - American pilots in World War II .
Following completion of that film , work will begin on the Star Wars TV series .
There has already been a Star Wars series spin-off in the shape of the animated Clone Wars , which began as three - minute episodes before they were expanded to 30 - minute shows .
Episode III : Revenge of the Sith , released in 2005 , marked the end of the end of the Star Wars saga on the big screen .
It became the biggest film franchise in history , with the final film alone taking £ 500 m at the box office outside of the US .

Thousands of acres would become “ the most extensive and beautiful [ park ] in the world ” .
He planned to power the city using hydroelectric dams on a new 11 - kilometer canal between the upper and lower Niagara Rivers .
Within a year , however , Love ’s plans failed , and would quickly have been forgotten if it were n’t for one problem .
The one part of Love ’s city that had been built was a kilometer - long pit that would have been a part of the canal .
After a few decades , this pit was purchased by the City of Niagara Falls , which had decided that it would make an ideal location for a needed chemical - dumping site .
After the pit was filled with waste , a neighborhood was built directly on top of it .
By the 1970s , the Love Canal became the site of one of the worst environmental disasters in American history .
Back in 1892 , it seemed inconceivable that Love ’s plans would fall apart so dramatically .
He was a driven and charismatic man , who filled his brochures with wild promises and other hyperbole .
The idea of a new city “ among the greatest manufacturing cities in the United States ” drew many supporters and investors ; the following year saw construction begin on the canal .
Then Love ’s ideas were quashed fairly quickly by a combination of factors .
The fluctuations of the economy scared off the investors ; the discovery of how electricity could be efficiently transmitted over long distances made Love ’s canal seem unnecessary ; and local politicians prohibited the diversion of the rivers ’ water altogether .
And thus Love ’s ambitions evaporated almost overnight .
Abandoned homes along the Love Canal
The pit remained , filling with rainwater and becoming a local recreation area : swimming in the summer , skating in the winter .
In 1920 the land was sold to nearby Niagara Falls , a growing industrial town that immediately started using the pit as a dumping ground for chemical wastes .
This continued for more than twenty years , after which the Hooker Chemical and Plastics Corporation ( now a part of Occidental Petroleum or OxyChem ) purchased the land for their own chemical disposal .
By 1953 , the company had buried nearly 22,000 tons of waste , and the pit was virtually full .
At that time , the dangers of chemical wastes were almost entirely unknown .
Far from being alarmed or even wary of living next to a major chemical producer , the city ’s residents were delighted at the medical and other developments that the chemical industry was bringing in .
No one thought that the same companies could engage in any potentially dangerous activities .
The Love Canal was lined with clay and covered with dirt to supposedly seal it , and Hooker Chemical ’s experts declared it safe .
Only the occasional scientist recognized the dangers of chemical waste in the 1940s .
One , a Dr. Robert Mobbs , had explored the link between insecticides and cancer ; he would later strongly denounce Hooker Chemical as not just careless but also aware of the potential for danger in its dumping ground .
It is not certain whether Hooker suspected the potential effects of its waste products .
However , the fact that the company sold the Love Canal land for a single dollar is suspicious .
So is the carefully - worded disclaimer that Hooker included with the sale , disclaiming any responsibility for side - effects from chemical exposure .
Either way , these subtle warnings were not the red flag they should have been .
The Niagara Falls Board of Education , which was in urgent need of more classroom space , eagerly purchased the land and began constructing a new elementary school .
In 1955 , four hundred children began attending the school , as about 100 homes were built in the surrounding areas .
Although most of the residents of Niagara Falls knew what the land had been previously used for , they were not cautioned about living on it .
Unsurprisingly , the direct effects of the pit ’s contents were soon felt .
Strange odors and substances were reported by residents , especially those with basements .
Pieces of phosphorus made their way to the surface ; children in the schoolyard were burned by toxic waste .
Local officials were alerted , but took no action .
In 1976 , water from heavy rains and a record - breaking blizzard caused a significant amount of chemical waste to migrate to the surface , where it contaminated the entire neighborhood .
In the following years the area was stricken with higher than normal rates of stillborn births and miscarriages , and many babies were born with birth defects .
Informal studies at this time noted the frightening trend .
One , by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry , observed more than 400 types of chemicals in the air , water , and soil , with some of them – such as benzene – already known to be carcinogenic .
One particular family that was affected was that of local mother Lois Gibbs .
After reading about the history of the Love Canal in a local publication , she realized that her young son Michael had been constantly ill since starting at the new school .
Gibbs asked for her son to be transferred ; when this failed , she went from door to door in her neighborhood with a petition to close the school .
The situation turned out to be even worse than she had thought ; her rounds made it clear that the entire neighborhood was ill .
Gibbs went on to lead the campaign to call attention to the neighborhood ; she was joined by many other local parents as well as the editors of the Niagara Falls Gazette .
Finally , in the spring of 1978 , state health commissioner Dr. Robert P. Whalen declared the area around the Love Canal hazardous .
The school closed , the land was sectioned off , and more than 200 families in the immediate area were evacuated .
By August of that year , the hazardous site was receiving national attention .
On 7 August , President Jimmy Carter called upon the Federal Disaster Assistance Agency for its help .
In September , Dr. Whalen released an intensive report on the disaster , which read in part :
The profound and devastating effects of the Love Canal tragedy , in terms of human health and suffering and environmental damage , cannot and probably will never be fully measured … [ w]e cannot undo the damage that has been wrought at Love Canal but we can take appropriate preventive measures so that we are better able to anticipate and hopefully prevent future events of this kind .
Lawsuits were quick to arrive , and Hooker Chemical found itself being sued for more than $ 11 billion .
The corporation denied its involvement through this series , even when faced by the Federal Justice Department in 1979 and New York State in 1989 .
Still , a great deal of damage had been done , and eventually more than 1,000 families had to be moved out of the Love Canal area .
An EPA study revealed that of the thirty - six people tested , eleven had chromosomal damage ; and that of fifteen Love Canal babies born between January 1979 and January 1980 , only two were healthy .
Agencies at the state and federal levels spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to clean up the pollution .
Of that , Hooker Chemical has eventually been persuaded to contribute about $ 130 million .
One good thing that came out of the disaster was the creation of the Comprehensive Environmental Response , Compensation , and Liability Act , more commonly known as the ‘ Superfund ’ law .
Its aim is to collects taxes from gas and chemical corporations to be used directly to clean up any sites similar to the Love Canal .
OxyChem now lists ‘ making chemical plants safer and more environmentally sound ’ as one of its goals .
Houses in the area today .
There is a sad irony in the fact that the site of William T. Love ’s “ most perfect city in existence ” became home to such a disaster .
In the last fifteen years , however , there has been some gradual resettlement of the Love Canal site .
In the early 1990s parts of the area were declared safe again , and now make up a neighborhood known as Black Creek Village .
The area was taken off the Superfund list in September 2004 at the announcement that certain clean - up goals had been reached .
Much of the Canal itself , however , remains sectioned off by a chain - link fence , which to any local passersby must serve as a poignant reminder of the whole catastrophe .
Update :
If you believe that you have been personally affected by the pollution at Love Canal , you can call the EPA hotline or fill out the violation report form on the EPA website .
The Daily Show is playing it safe , as they do n't think the message has been entirely saturated by the public mind .
Thus , they felt the need to trot out Resident Expert Sir John Hodgman to remind folks yet again this important message from Senator Ted Stevens ( R - AK ) .
This message again can help you to differentiate a " big truck " from the " internet . "
Although we 're sure you already know this , we wanted to make sure you heard it not only from us ( on both occassions ) , but also from a true Resident Expert .
Thus , we bring you the talented Sir John .
Sir John , take it away .
With natural gas prices climbing as well , wind turbines have become attractive to Indian business .
The Essar Group of Mumbai , a big industrial conglomerate active in shipping , steel and construction , is now working on plans for a wind farm near Chennai , formerly Madras , after concluding that regulatory changes in India have made it financially attractive .
“ The mechanisms did n’t used to be there ; now they are , ” said Jose Numpeli , vice president for operations at Essar Power .
The electricity boards “ know how to cost it , they know how to pay for it . ”
Roughly 70 percent of the demand for wind turbines in India comes from industrial users seeking alternatives to relying on the grid , said Tulsi R. Tanti , Suzlon ’s managing director .
The rest of the purchases are made by a small group of wealthy families in India , for whom the tax breaks for wind turbines are attractive .
Wind will remain competitive as long as the price of crude oil remains above $ 40 a barrel , Mr. Tanti estimated .
To remain cost - effective below $ 40 a barrel , wind energy may require subsidies , or possibly carbon - based taxes on oil and other fossil fuels .
Mr. Tanti and his three younger brothers were running a textile business in Gujarat , in northwestern India , when they purchased a German wind turbine — only to find that they could not keep it running .
So they decided to build and maintain turbines themselves , starting Suzlon in 1995 and later leaving the textile business .
To minimize land costs , wind farms are typically in rural areas , chosen for the strength of the wind there as well as low prices for land .
But that can mean culture shock .
“ There were no big changes until the turbines came , ” Mr. Patil said , pausing from plowing here with his father in this remote , hilly , tribal area 200 miles northeast of Mumbai , where oxen remain at the center of farm life and motorized vehicles are uncommon .

July 2004
( This essay is derived from a talk at Oscon 2004 . )
A few months ago I finished a new book , and in reviews I keep noticing words like " provocative ' ' and " controversial . ''
To say nothing of " idiotic . ''
I did n't mean to make the book controversial .
I was trying to make it efficient .
I did n't want to waste people 's time telling them things they already knew .
It 's more efficient just to give them the diffs .
But I suppose that 's bound to yield an alarming book .
Edisons
There 's no controversy about which idea is most controversial : the suggestion that variation in wealth might not be as big a problem as we think .
I did n't say in the book that variation in wealth was in itself a good thing .
I said in some situations it might be a sign of good things .
A throbbing headache is not a good thing , but it can be a sign of a good thing -- for example , that you 're recovering consciousness after being hit on the head .
Variation in wealth can be a sign of variation in productivity .
( In a society of one , they 're identical . )
And that is almost certainly a good thing : if your society has no variation in productivity , it 's probably not because everyone is Thomas Edison .
It 's probably because you have no Thomas Edisons .
In a low - tech society you do n't see much variation in productivity .
If you have a tribe of nomads collecting sticks for a fire , how much more productive is the best stick gatherer going to be than the worst ?
A factor of two ?
Whereas when you hand people a complex tool like a computer , the variation in what they can do with it is enormous .
That 's not a new idea .
Fred Brooks wrote about it in 1974 , and the study he quoted was published in 1968 .
But I think he underestimated the variation between programmers .
He wrote about productivity in lines of code : the best programmers can solve a given problem in a tenth the time .
But what if the problem is n't given ?
In programming , as in many fields , the hard part is n't solving problems , but deciding what problems to solve .
Imagination is hard to measure , but in practice it dominates the kind of productivity that 's measured in lines of code .
Productivity varies in any field , but there are few in which it varies so much .
The variation between programmers is so great that it becomes a difference in kind .
I do n't think this is something intrinsic to programming , though .
In every field , technology magnifies differences in productivity .
I think what 's happening in programming is just that we have a lot of technological leverage .
But in every field the lever is getting longer , so the variation we see is something that more and more fields will see as time goes on .
And the success of companies , and countries , will depend increasingly on how they deal with it .
If variation in productivity increases with technology , then the contribution of the most productive individuals will not only be disproportionately large , but will actually grow with time .
When you reach the point where 90 % of a group 's output is created by 1 % of its members , you lose big if something ( whether Viking raids , or central planning ) drags their productivity down to the average .
If we want to get the most out of them , we need to understand these especially productive people .
What motivates them ?
What do they need to do their jobs ?
How do you recognize them ?
How do you get them to come and work for you ?
And then of course there 's the question , how do you become one ?
More than Money
I know a handful of super - hackers , so I sat down and thought about what they have in common .
Their defining quality is probably that they really love to program .
Ordinary programmers write code to pay the bills .
Great hackers think of it as something they do for fun , and which they 're delighted to find people will pay them for .
Great programmers are sometimes said to be indifferent to money .
This is n't quite true .
It is true that all they really care about is doing interesting work .
But if you make enough money , you get to work on whatever you want , and for that reason hackers are attracted by the idea of making really large amounts of money .
But as long as they still have to show up for work every day , they care more about what they do there than how much they get paid for it .
Economically , this is a fact of the greatest importance , because it means you do n't have to pay great hackers anything like what they 're worth .
A great programmer might be ten or a hundred times as productive as an ordinary one , but he 'll consider himself lucky to get paid three times as much .
As I 'll explain later , this is partly because great hackers do n't know how good they are .
But it 's also because money is not the main thing they want .
What do hackers want ?
Like all craftsmen , hackers like good tools .
In fact , that 's an understatement .
Good hackers find it unbearable to use bad tools .
They 'll simply refuse to work on projects with the wrong infrastructure .
At a startup I once worked for , one of the things pinned up on our bulletin board was an ad from IBM .
It was a picture of an AS400 , and the headline read , I think , " hackers despise it . ' ' [ 1 ]
When you decide what infrastructure to use for a project , you 're not just making a technical decision .
You 're also making a social decision , and this may be the more important of the two .
For example , if your company wants to write some software , it might seem a prudent choice to write it in Java .
But when you choose a language , you 're also choosing a community .
The programmers you 'll be able to hire to work on a Java project wo n't be as smart as the ones you could get to work on a project written in Python .
And the quality of your hackers probably matters more than the language you choose .
Though , frankly , the fact that good hackers prefer Python to Java should tell you something about the relative merits of those languages .
Business types prefer the most popular languages because they view languages as standards .
They do n't want to bet the company on Betamax .
The thing about languages , though , is that they 're not just standards .
If you have to move bits over a network , by all means use TCP / IP .
But a programming language is n't just a format .
A programming language is a medium of expression .
I 've read that Java has just overtaken Cobol as the most popular language .
As a standard , you could n't wish for more .
But as a medium of expression , you could do a lot better .
Of all the great programmers I can think of , I know of only one who would voluntarily program in Java .
And of all the great programmers I can think of who do n't work for Sun , on Java , I know of zero .
Great hackers also generally insist on using open source software .
Not just because it 's better , but because it gives them more control .
Good hackers insist on control .
This is part of what makes them good hackers : when something 's broken , they need to fix it .
You want them to feel this way about the software they 're writing for you .
You should n't be surprised when they feel the same way about the operating system .
A couple years ago a venture capitalist friend told me about a new startup he was involved with .
It sounded promising .
But the next time I talked to him , he said they 'd decided to build their software on Windows NT , and had just hired a very experienced NT developer to be their chief technical officer .
When I heard this , I thought , these guys are doomed .
One , the CTO could n't be a first rate hacker , because to become an eminent NT developer he would have had to use NT voluntarily , multiple times , and I could n't imagine a great hacker doing that ; and two , even if he was good , he'd have a hard time hiring anyone good to work for him if the project had to be built on NT . [ 2 ]
The Final Frontier
After software , the most important tool to a hacker is probably his office .
Big companies think the function of office space is to express rank .
But hackers use their offices for more than that : they use their office as a place to think in .
And if you 're a technology company , their thoughts are your product .
So making hackers work in a noisy , distracting environment is like having a paint factory where the air is full of soot .
The cartoon strip Dilbert has a lot to say about cubicles , and with good reason .
All the hackers I know despise them .
The mere prospect of being interrupted is enough to prevent hackers from working on hard problems .
If you want to get real work done in an office with cubicles , you have two options : work at home , or come in early or late or on a weekend , when no one else is there .
Do n't companies realize this is a sign that something is broken ?
An office environment is supposed to be something that helps you work , not something you work despite .
Companies like Cisco are proud that everyone there has a cubicle , even the CEO .
But they 're not so advanced as they think ; obviously they still view office space as a badge of rank .
Note too that Cisco is famous for doing very little product development in house .
They get new technology by buying the startups that created it -- where presumably the hackers did have somewhere quiet to work .
One big company that understands what hackers need is Microsoft .
I once saw a recruiting ad for Microsoft with a big picture of a door .
Work for us , the premise was , and we 'll give you a place to work where you can actually get work done .
And you know , Microsoft is remarkable among big companies in that they are able to develop software in house .
Not well , perhaps , but well enough .
If companies want hackers to be productive , they should look at what they do at home .
At home , hackers can arrange things themselves so they can get the most done .
And when they work at home , hackers do n't work in noisy , open spaces ; they work in rooms with doors .
They work in cosy , neighborhoody places with people around and somewhere to walk when they need to mull something over , instead of in glass boxes set in acres of parking lots .
They have a sofa they can take a nap on when they feel tired , instead of sitting in a coma at their desk , pretending to work .
There 's no crew of people with vacuum cleaners that roars through every evening during the prime hacking hours .
There are no meetings or , God forbid , corporate retreats or team - building exercises .
And when you look at what they 're doing on that computer , you 'll find it reinforces what I said earlier about tools .
They may have to use Java and Windows at work , but at home , where they can choose for themselves , you 're more likely to find them using Perl and Linux .
Indeed , these statistics about Cobol or Java being the most popular language can be misleading .
What we ought to look at , if we want to know what tools are best , is what hackers choose when they can choose freely -- that is , in projects of their own .
When you ask that question , you find that open source operating systems already have a dominant market share , and the number one language is probably Perl .
Interesting
Along with good tools , hackers want interesting projects .
What makes a project interesting ?
Well , obviously overtly sexy applications like stealth planes or special effects software would be interesting to work on .
But any application can be interesting if it poses novel technical challenges .
So it 's hard to predict which problems hackers will like , because some become interesting only when the people working on them discover a new kind of solution .
Before ITA ( who wrote the software inside Orbitz ) , the people working on airline fare searches probably thought it was one of the most boring applications imaginable .
But ITA made it interesting by redefining the problem in a more ambitious way .
I think the same thing happened at Google .
When Google was founded , the conventional wisdom among the so - called portals was that search was boring and unimportant .
But the guys at Google did n't think search was boring , and that 's why they do it so well .
This is an area where managers can make a difference .
Like a parent saying to a child , I bet you can't clean up your whole room in ten minutes , a good manager can sometimes redefine a problem as a more interesting one .
Steve Jobs seems to be particularly good at this , in part simply by having high standards .
There were a lot of small , inexpensive computers before the Mac .
He redefined the problem as : make one that 's beautiful .
And that probably drove the developers harder than any carrot or stick could .
They certainly delivered .
When the Mac first appeared , you did n't even have to turn it on to know it would be good ; you could tell from the case .
A few weeks ago I was walking along the street in Cambridge , and in someone 's trash I saw what appeared to be a Mac carrying case .
I looked inside , and there was a Mac SE .
I carried it home and plugged it in , and it booted .
The happy Macintosh face , and then the finder .
My God , it was so simple .
It was just like ... Google .
Hackers like to work for people with high standards .
But it 's not enough just to be exacting .
You have to insist on the right things .
Which usually means that you have to be a hacker yourself .
I 've seen occasional articles about how to manage programmers .
Really there should be two articles : one about what to do if you are yourself a programmer , and one about what to do if you 're not .
And the second could probably be condensed into two words : give up .
The problem is not so much the day to day management .
Really good hackers are practically self - managing .
The problem is , if you 're not a hacker , you can't tell who the good hackers are .
A similar problem explains why American cars are so ugly .
I call it the design paradox .
You might think that you could make your products beautiful just by hiring a great designer to design them .
But if you yourself do n't have good taste , how are you going to recognize a good designer ?
By definition you can't tell from his portfolio .
And you can't go by the awards he 's won or the jobs he's had , because in design , as in most fields , those tend to be driven by fashion and schmoozing , with actual ability a distant third .
There 's no way around it : you can't manage a process intended to produce beautiful things without knowing what beautiful is .
American cars are ugly because American car companies are run by people with bad taste .
Many people in this country think of taste as something elusive , or even frivolous .
It is neither .
To drive design , a manager must be the most demanding user of a company 's products .
And if you have really good taste , you can , as Steve Jobs does , make satisfying you the kind of problem that good people like to work on .
Nasty Little Problems
It 's pretty easy to say what kinds of problems are not interesting : those where instead of solving a few big , clear , problems , you have to solve a lot of nasty little ones .
One of the worst kinds of projects is writing an interface to a piece of software that 's full of bugs .
Another is when you have to customize something for an individual client 's complex and ill - defined needs .
To hackers these kinds of projects are the death of a thousand cuts .
The distinguishing feature of nasty little problems is that you do n't learn anything from them .
Writing a compiler is interesting because it teaches you what a compiler is .
But writing an interface to a buggy piece of software does n't teach you anything , because the bugs are random . [ 3 ]
So it 's not just fastidiousness that makes good hackers avoid nasty little problems .
It 's more a question of self - preservation .
Working on nasty little problems makes you stupid .
Good hackers avoid it for the same reason models avoid cheeseburgers .
Of course some problems inherently have this character .
And because of supply and demand , they pay especially well .
So a company that found a way to get great hackers to work on tedious problems would be very successful .
How would you do it ?
One place this happens is in startups .
At our startup we had Robert Morris working as a system administrator .
That 's like having the Rolling Stones play at a bar mitzvah .
You can't hire that kind of talent .
But people will do any amount of drudgery for companies of which they 're the founders . [ 4 ]
Bigger companies solve the problem by partitioning the company .
They get smart people to work for them by establishing a separate R&D department where employees do n't have to work directly on customers ' nasty little problems . [ 5 ]
In this model , the research department functions like a mine .
They produce new ideas ; maybe the rest of the company will be able to use them .
You may not have to go to this extreme .
Bottom - up programming suggests another way to partition the company : have the smart people work as toolmakers .
If your company makes software to do x , have one group that builds tools for writing software of that type , and another that uses these tools to write the applications .
This way you might be able to get smart people to write 99 % of your code , but still keep them almost as insulated from users as they would be in a traditional research department .
The toolmakers would have users , but they 'd only be the company 's own developers . [ 6 ]
If Microsoft used this approach , their software would n't be so full of security holes , because the less smart people writing the actual applications would n't be doing low - level stuff like allocating memory .
Instead of writing Word directly in C , they'd be plugging together big Lego blocks of Word - language .
( Duplo , I believe , is the technical term . )
Clumping
Along with interesting problems , what good hackers like is other good hackers .
Great hackers tend to clump together -- sometimes spectacularly so , as at Xerox Parc .
So you wo n't attract good hackers in linear proportion to how good an environment you create for them .
The tendency to clump means it 's more like the square of the environment .
So it 's winner take all .
At any given time , there are only about ten or twenty places where hackers most want to work , and if you are n't one of them , you wo n't just have fewer great hackers , you 'll have zero .
Having great hackers is not , by itself , enough to make a company successful .
It works well for Google and ITA , which are two of the hot spots right now , but it did n't help Thinking Machines or Xerox .
Sun had a good run for a while , but their business model is a down elevator .
In that situation , even the best hackers can't save you .
I think , though , that all other things being equal , a company that can attract great hackers will have a huge advantage .
There are people who would disagree with this .
When we were making the rounds of venture capital firms in the 1990s , several told us that software companies did n't win by writing great software , but through brand , and dominating channels , and doing the right deals .
They really seemed to believe this , and I think I know why .
I think what a lot of VCs are looking for , at least unconsciously , is the next Microsoft .
And of course if Microsoft is your model , you should n't be looking for companies that hope to win by writing great software .
But VCs are mistaken to look for the next Microsoft , because no startup can be the next Microsoft unless some other company is prepared to bend over at just the right moment and be the next IBM .
It 's a mistake to use Microsoft as a model , because their whole culture derives from that one lucky break .
Microsoft is a bad data point .
If you throw them out , you find that good products do tend to win in the market .
What VCs should be looking for is the next Apple , or the next Google .
I think Bill Gates knows this .
What worries him about Google is not the power of their brand , but the fact that they have better hackers . [ 7 ]
Recognition
So who are the great hackers ?
How do you know when you meet one ?
That turns out to be very hard .
Even hackers can't tell .
I 'm pretty sure now that my friend Trevor Blackwell is a great hacker .
You may have read on Slashdot how he made his own Segway .
The remarkable thing about this project was that he wrote all the software in one day ( in Python , incidentally ) .
For Trevor , that 's par for the course .
But when I first met him , I thought he was a complete idiot .
He was standing in Robert Morris 's office babbling at him about something or other , and I remember standing behind him making frantic gestures at Robert to shoo this nut out of his office so we could go to lunch .
Robert says he misjudged Trevor at first too .
Apparently when Robert first met him , Trevor had just begun a new scheme that involved writing down everything about every aspect of his life on a stack of index cards , which he carried with him everywhere .
He 'd also just arrived from Canada , and had a strong Canadian accent and a mullet .
The problem is compounded by the fact that hackers , despite their reputation for social obliviousness , sometimes put a good deal of effort into seeming smart .
When I was in grad school I used to hang around the MIT AI Lab occasionally .
It was kind of intimidating at first .
Everyone there spoke so fast .
But after a while I learned the trick of speaking fast .
You do n't have to think any faster ; just use twice as many words to say everything .
With this amount of noise in the signal , it 's hard to tell good hackers when you meet them .
I can't tell , even now .
You also can't tell from their resumes .
It seems like the only way to judge a hacker is to work with him on something .
And this is the reason that high - tech areas only happen around universities .
The active ingredient here is not so much the professors as the students .
Startups grow up around universities because universities bring together promising young people and make them work on the same projects .
The smart ones learn who the other smart ones are , and together they cook up new projects of their own .
Because you can't tell a great hacker except by working with him , hackers themselves can't tell how good they are .
This is true to a degree in most fields .
I 've found that people who are great at something are not so much convinced of their own greatness as mystified at why everyone else seems so incompetent .
But it 's particularly hard for hackers to know how good they are , because it 's hard to compare their work .
This is easier in most other fields .
In the hundred meters , you know in 10 seconds who 's fastest .
Even in math there seems to be a general consensus about which problems are hard to solve , and what constitutes a good solution .
But hacking is like writing .
Who can say which of two novels is better ?
Certainly not the authors .
With hackers , at least , other hackers can tell .
That 's because , unlike novelists , hackers collaborate on projects .
When you get to hit a few difficult problems over the net at someone , you learn pretty quickly how hard they hit them back .
But hackers can't watch themselves at work .
So if you ask a great hacker how good he is , he 's almost certain to reply , I do n't know .
He 's not just being modest .
He really does n't know .
And none of us know , except about people we 've actually worked with .
Which puts us in a weird situation : we do n't know who our heroes should be .
The hackers who become famous tend to become famous by random accidents of PR .
Occasionally I need to give an example of a great hacker , and I never know who to use .
The first names that come to mind always tend to be people I know personally , but it seems lame to use them .
So , I think , maybe I should say Richard Stallman , or Linus Torvalds , or Alan Kay , or someone famous like that .
But I have no idea if these guys are great hackers .
I 've never worked with them on anything .
If there is a Michael Jordan of hacking , no one knows , including him .

Finally , the question the hackers have all been wondering about : how do you become a great hacker ?
I do n't know if it 's possible to make yourself into one .
But it 's certainly possible to do things that make you stupid , and if you can make yourself stupid , you can probably make yourself smart too .
The key to being a good hacker may be to work on what you like .
When I think about the great hackers I know , one thing they have in common is the extreme difficulty of making them work on anything they do n't want to .
I do n't know if this is cause or effect ; it may be both .
To do something well you have to love it .
So to the extent you can preserve hacking as something you love , you 're likely to do it well .
Try to keep the sense of wonder you had about programming at age 14 .
If you 're worried that your current job is rotting your brain , it probably is .
The best hackers tend to be smart , of course , but that 's true in a lot of fields .
Is there some quality that 's unique to hackers ?
I asked some friends , and the number one thing they mentioned was curiosity .
I 'd always supposed that all smart people were curious -- that curiosity was simply the first derivative of knowledge .
But apparently hackers are particularly curious , especially about how things work .
That makes sense , because programs are in effect giant descriptions of how things work .
Several friends mentioned hackers ' ability to concentrate -- their ability , as one put it , to " tune out everything outside their own heads . ''
I 've certainly noticed this .
And I 've heard several hackers say that after drinking even half a beer they can't program at all .
So maybe hacking does require some special ability to focus .
Perhaps great hackers can load a large amount of context into their head , so that when they look at a line of code , they see not just that line but the whole program around it .
John McPhee wrote that Bill Bradley 's success as a basketball player was due partly to his extraordinary peripheral vision .
" Perfect ' ' eyesight means about 47 degrees of vertical peripheral vision .
Bill Bradley had 70 ; he could see the basket when he was looking at the floor .
Maybe great hackers have some similar inborn ability .
( I cheat by using a very dense language , which shrinks the court . )
This could explain the disconnect over cubicles .
Maybe the people in charge of facilities , not having any concentration to shatter , have no idea that working in a cubicle feels to a hacker like having one 's brain in a blender .
( Whereas Bill , if the rumors of autism are true , knows all too well . )
One difference I 've noticed between great hackers and smart people in general is that hackers are more politically incorrect .
To the extent there is a secret handshake among good hackers , it 's when they know one another well enough to express opinions that would get them stoned to death by the general public .
And I can see why political incorrectness would be a useful quality in programming .
Programs are very complex and , at least in the hands of good programmers , very fluid .
In such situations it 's helpful to have a habit of questioning assumptions .
Can you cultivate these qualities ?
I do n't know .
But you can at least not repress them .
So here is my best shot at a recipe .
If it is possible to make yourself into a great hacker , the way to do it may be to make the following deal with yourself : you never have to work on boring projects ( unless your family will starve otherwise ) , and in return , you 'll never allow yourself to do a half - assed job .
All the great hackers I know seem to have made that deal , though perhaps none of them had any choice in the matter .
Notes
[ 1 ]
In fairness , I have to say that IBM makes decent hardware .
I wrote this on an IBM laptop .
[ 2 ]
They did turn out to be doomed .
They shut down a few months later .
[ 3 ]
I think this is what people mean when they talk about the " meaning of life . "
On the face of it , this seems an odd idea .
Life is n't an expression ; how could it have meaning ?
But it can have a quality that feels a lot like meaning .
In a project like a compiler , you have to solve a lot of problems , but the problems all fall into a pattern , as in a signal .
Whereas when the problems you have to solve are random , they seem like noise .
[ 4 ]
Einstein at one point worked designing refrigerators .
( He had equity . )
[ 5 ]
It 's hard to say exactly what constitutes research in the computer world , but as a first approximation , it 's software that does n't have users .
I do n't think it 's publication that makes the best hackers want to work in research departments .
I think it 's mainly not having to have a three hour meeting with a product manager about problems integrating the Korean version of Word 13.27 with the talking paperclip .
[ 6 ]
Something similar has been happening for a long time in the construction industry .
When you had a house built a couple hundred years ago , the local builders built everything in it .
But increasingly what builders do is assemble components designed and manufactured by someone else .
This has , like the arrival of desktop publishing , given people the freedom to experiment in disastrous ways , but it is certainly more efficient .
[ 7 ]
Google is much more dangerous to Microsoft than Netscape was .
Probably more dangerous than any other company has ever been .
Not least because they 're determined to fight .
On their job listing page , they say that one of their " core values ' ' is " Do n't be evil . ''
From a company selling soybean oil or mining equipment , such a statement would merely be eccentric .
But I think all of us in the computer world recognize who that is a declaration of war on .

Digg 's Kevin Rose on Recent Indiggnation : Fact vs. Fiction
We ( Jason , Evan and John ) had a conference call with Kevin Rose ( President ) and Jay Adelson ( CEO ) of Digg to give them an opportunity to respond to speculation from Evan and others about how a small number of users are controlling placement of stories on Digg 's home page .
Jay and Kevin said they could n't explicitly detail how Digg 's ranking algorithm works because it would be used by those who want to game the system ( the aiding the enemy defense is popular these days ) , but they gave enough information to understand the basics of how Digg 's version of a democracy works .
Just because a story gets a lot of diggs does n't mean it 's home page bound .
Who is digging ( and his or her reputation ) is also very important .
Digg factors in the length of time that a person has been a digger as well as the amount of their activity , so stories boosted by old - time frequent diggers will rise above stories that are dugg by newbies to the site .
Digg users have to participate for an unspecified " short " period of time before their diggs will carry the full weight .
So the most senior diggers ( including the editors ) do have more influence , but according to Jay ( per a follow - up email ) " there is general sense of a maximum " weight that the most senior diggers can carry .
The algorithm does not care about who submits a story , but the quality of the headline as well as the number of images and external links on the article page also matters .
So while our democracy ( electoral college aside ) does n't care how long or often you vote , your history matters to Digg .
This makes it a challenge for participants who have joined recently to have a say in the new sections such as sports or entertainment .
( Jay said Digg uses a different algorithm for each section ) .
Other factors that influence a story 's chance of getting on the home page include time of day , day of the week that the articles are submitted and the number of times it was buried .
Kevin said that explains why some popular stories that made it to the home page are sometimes removed .
The names of people who bury stories are not disclosed because " we do n't want to start flame wars .
"
When asked why his name appeared several times on stories that were dugg sequentially dugg by the same people , Kevin said he was using the DiggUpdate tool to track users , two of whom turned out to be people who were gaming the system and were subsequently banned .
( Could he really have been that naive ? ) Kevin and Jay said the intention has never been to allow " gangs " of users to game the system , and while Digg has always looked for patterns of groups who consistently digg the same stories , Digg will soon update its algorithm to further prevent gang activity .
Kevin said that while friends who track each others diggs should n't be discriminated against , " 20 people who always vote together need to be treated as one mind " by the algorithm .
( Jay said today 's outage at Digg was for a software update , but he said he did n't know all of the features that were being added ) .
So just as new websites are " sandboxed " by search engines that lower their rankings until they have been established , new digg users must become active participants and wait a while until they count as much as other users .
This is good business practice for Digg ( it motivates people to come back often , thereby building traffic ) , but it is a disincentive for users looking for instant gratification .
No democracy is perfect , but Digg promises to continually update its algorithm so that users will be the primary weighting factor determing how articles get promoted on the site .
And bloggers are correct to make sure that they are doing their job well .
( 19 ) Thoughts on Digg 's Kevin Rose on Recent Indiggnation : Fact vs. Fiction
why can't the algorithm be as simple as " The article that is most dugg " by unique user be on the top ?
I say , if digg start to add too much of the enginuity , they will screw it up and piss off many people ....
Comments by impu : Thursday , September 07 , 2006 at 06:39 PM
" And bloggers are correct to make sure that they are doing their job well . "
Exactly .
Some people have been saying , " Quit your complaining ! " .
It 's not complaining , it 's just helping out a system we all love .
If you never say anything ( or blog about it ) nothing ever changes .
Comments by Sean : Thursday , September 07 , 2006 at 06:41 PM
JUST HIDE THE FUCKING NAME OF THE USER UNTIL HIS STORY HITS THE FRONT PAGE .
It 's not that hard .
Comments by asd : Thursday , September 07 , 2006 at 06:48 PM
Even simpler : never display the name of the submitter .
Then there is no ego gratification to reward people for submitting stories nor is there any complaints by people recognizing patterns of submissions .
Problem Solved .
Comments by panique : Thursday , September 07 , 2006 at 06:56 PM
That does n't prevent a user IMing the story title to another user with instructions to digg it up .
Hiding the name does little to blunt the efforts of a group if they are at all determined .
Comments by hap : Thursday , September 07 , 2006 at 06:58 PM
^ Then they'd have to remove the friends tracking system where you can find your friend 's dugg stories .
Also people could email their friends about the title / link of the story and have them digg it .
Comments by Daniel : Thursday , September 07 , 2006 at 07:08 PM
I do n't really see a problem with groups of friends digging the same content .
Howevever , if the senior digg users are using their " power " for evil by setting up multiple digg accounts for themselves to digg the same story then they should be blocked .
Good luck identifying that ...
Comments by Andy : Thursday , September 07 , 2006 at 09:04 PM
It sounds like Digg is doing all the right things ; yet , the Digg Ranking Algorithm is still perceived to be unfair by many .
Comments by webmetricsguru : Thursday , September 07 , 2006 at 10:28 PM
Digg is good , but sometimes inaccurate stories get dugg to the top ... which we have to look out for .
Comments by Gdog : Thursday , September 07 , 2006 at 11:09 PM
Is n't the point of digg to get information out to people , not who is submitting the story .
If Joe Blow wants to spend his entire day digging stories and what not , he should be getting to the top page .
And as for this part of the article
" So while our democracy ( electoral college aside ) does n't care how long or often you vote , your history matters to Digg . "
The United States is a Republic , not a democracy .
Comments by Greg : Thursday , September 07 , 2006 at 11:21 PM
Digg is not a democracy .
Democracies and Republics for that matter do not give more voting leverage to older members of the society .
Otherwise the older members of the society would vote to send the younger members of society off to fight wars for them and essentially enslave them to the system .
Uh , wait , maybe Digg is a Republic or Democracy , sounds all too real .
Glad I turn 40 in a few years - never said that before .

Like all extremely popular new concepts , it takes time and patience to optimize and tweak to perfection .
But even factoring in any imperfections , the I.T. world is certainly better off because DIGG was created
There are many top users who get to homepage stories and are completely honest

Comments by Search Engines : Friday , September 08 , 2006 at 01:14 AM
I think too many people are seeing this as taking a hammer to the algorithm , when it is more likely a small tap or tweak .
More or less " weight " is also a relative term since we have no idea of specific numbers in the algorithm .
Also , for those of you out there who think " what the hell ... why not just let the most dugg stories go to the front , regardless " , can look under American History : The Federalist Papers , arguably the most insightful documents to the founding of the U.S.
Think of gangs who promote stories for whatever their motivation is , to be known as " Tyranny of the minority " .
Comments by xray : Friday , September 08 , 2006 at 02:06 AM
I think that Diggs algorithm should be applied to general voting systems .
I think that more and more people ar e not voting , especially here in the UK .
Maybe if you earned your vote you 'd appreciate how hard it was won and value the power it has .
And that taking a more active part in any democratic state can only be agood thing for all .
Comments by Car 54 : Thursday , September 14 , 2006 at 05:35 PM
I 'm a newbie to digg and feel that Kevin and his crew should be given a chance to perfect the digg format .
I like digg because I get to see things I normally would n't see just cruising the net alone .
We need a free exchange of ideas , especially in technology .
I miss the old TechTV and am glad there is a new technology forum .
GO FOR IT !!!!
Comments by popp1999 : Wednesday , September 20 , 2006 at 01:45 PM
There ’s a site out there called DiggHelper.com that helps promote your digg articles if you ’re looking to generate more traffic from digg .
It ’s main purpose is to help businesses who use digg.com to promote themselves .

I still like Reddit , a much better algorithm and the system is very simple and powerful .
It leads to alot of abuse but the users are starting to filter it out themselves .
Its a great system , but the users need to learn how to use it .
So instead of creating all of the boundaries like Digg is doing , the users on Reddit are learning social news site etiquette .
Comments by Jody brewster : Monday , February 05 , 2007 at 10:34 PM
User self - policing is still the best way to go , as no matter what algorithm changes Digg makes , it will be gamed at some point .
Empowering users , with some kind of visible metrics of Digg activity , and disempowering senior diggers sounds like a way to achieve " transparency . "
Comments by Larry : Sunday , December 07 , 2008 at 11:07 PM
The best articles should rise to the home page .
Put up the article on a preview page .
Ask for willing voters , configure a panel of 50 members none of whom should be friends of the authors .
The provide preliminary rating .
For all readers who are not friends of the writer allow rating .
This business is seniority appears to be part of creating attachment and a hierarchy within Digg .
It has nothing to do with the quality of writing .

Post a Comment
TO hear some people in the real estate industry tell it , one of the biggest problems with the housing market is what is being said about it in the news media .
Agents and industry executives say reporters , editors and news anchors are making a cooling market sound worse than it is .
While the number of sales may have dropped from 2005 ( which was a record - setting year , the end of a five - year run ) and more homes stay on the market longer , real estate professionals note that sale prices in much of the country are still higher than they were a year ago .
Richard A. Smith , vice chairman and president of the Realogy Corporation , the nation ’s largest residential real estate broker , said there was a “ constant flood of media that is so negative ” that it was discouraging many potential buyers and sellers .
“ Nobody wants to be foolish in this kind of market , ” he said .
“ No one wants to sell too low or buy too high . ”
Digg In Damage Control Mode
Digg seems to be caught between a rock and a hard place .
Following the recent controversy where their top users were virtually tarred and feathered , they promptly issued a statement that they are planning to make changes which will serve to maintain a level playing field for all users .
This statement caused many of Digg ’s top users to feel alienated , as it seemed to validate the witch - hunt which has been parading through their discussion threads since Thursday of last week .
Many of Digg ’s top users have thrown their hands in the air in response to this .
They have removed their avatars in a display of solidarity and many have stopped submitting content altogether .
The ones who continue to submit stories are faced with frequent flaming in discussion threads and hordes of users who are burying their submissions just because of who submits them ( as if that is some form of justice ) .
Now , it seems that Digg ’s staff has taken notice and has engaged in a bit of a juggling act .
They ’re taking on the task of making sure their top users do not feel alienated while at the same time maintaining that they will level the playing field .
Recently , Jay Adelson , Digg ’s CEO , replied to a comment advocating that top diggers ’ submissions be buried en masse with this :
I ’d prefer you let the content rule .
Digg what is good .
Bury what you do n’t like .
He then went on to defend the top diggers in another recent discussion thread :
What some users of digg are not getting , and it ’s our mistake for not making it clearer , is that we did NOT intend to associate our algorithm change with the top submitters !
These guys are hard working , honest , amazing contributors to digg , and frankly are being unfairly treated by a few bad apples .
Please , for goodness sake , stop with the targeted burying .
Digg stories you like .
Bury stories you do n’t .
Do n’t make this personal .
If there is abuse , trust us to deal with it , that is all I can ask .
He followed that up with another similar comment :
The mistake we made was not being clearer that we were not associating the algorithm change with the top submitters .
These guys are hard working , honest contributors to digg and are being unfairly scapegoated .
Please stop with the targeted burying …
Digg what you like , bury what you do n’t .
We ’ll take care of the abusers .
I agree 100 % with what Jay is saying and I just wanted to add that the fastest way to ruin Digg is to stop considering the merit of the content .
If you suspect that another user is breaking the Terms of Use or gaming Digg , you should email abuse@digg.com .
Do n’t bury content based on who submits it .
And now Kevin Rose has joined the fray and come to the defense of top diggers as well with a new blog post :
The intention of the post absolutely was n’t to point a finger at any individual or group .
It was intended to openly highlight some of the things we ’re doing to keep digg as useful , democratic , and devoid of misuse as possible .
I ’m convinced that Digg did not mean to validate the witch hunt that has been going on and that it was just poor timing on their part .
This is a good start on their part to help mend the divide that has been growing in their community .
More will need to be done though .
With 10 - of - 11 teams ranked in the USA Today / InterMat / NWCA top 25 , thereâÄôs no such thing as an easy weekend in Big Ten wrestling , but thereâÄôs no need to remind the Minnesota wrestling team âÄ ì especially because the Gophers are already quite familiar with who theyâÄôll line up against this weekend .
ItâÄôs a weekend of rematches for the No. 10 Gophers as they travel to State College , Penn . and Columbus , Ohio for duals against Penn State and Ohio State .
TonightâÄôs 6 p.m. matchup against the 16th - ranked Nittany Lions will be a repeat of the consolation semifinal at the National Duals , which Minnesota won 21 - 18 .
The Gophers met the No. 5 Buckeyes at the National Duals as well , falling 12 - 25 in the fifth place dual .
TheyâÄôll have a chance to avenge the loss Sunday at 10 a.m .
Though itâÄôs been a mere three weeks since Minnesota saw both teams , head coach J Robinson said there have been a litany of changes made by various Gophers wrestlers .
âÄúWeâÄôre trying to get some of the guys to understand that you have to change , âÄ ù he said .
âÄú If youâÄôre doing the same things you did two months ago and youâÄôre not winning you have to change something .
âÄúAs you start going up and down the lineup , thereâÄôs a lot of [ changes ] that are going on so we can be not only ready for the Big Ten season but [ beyond ] .
âÄù
Even the likes of two - time All American Jayson Ness , currently ranked 5th at 133 , and No. 8 Mike Thorn ( 141 ) are making meaningful adjustments , Robinson said .
But when heâÄôs discussing the men making major strides , Robinson keeps coming back to sophomore heavyweight Ben Berhow .
âÄúThereâÄôs a difference between the way Berhow wrestled two months ago and the way heâÄôs wrestling today , âÄ ù Robsinson said .
âÄú [ HeâÄôs learned ] if he wrestles a certain way heâÄôs going to have success .
âÄ ù
But that certain way isnâÄôt unique to Berhow .
âÄúA lot of heavyweights like to tie up and sit there and have maybe one or two explosive moves in the match , âÄ ù Berhow said .
âÄúBut thatâÄôs not our style at Minnesota ; we want to dominate opponents .
âÄ ù
In his last two duals , the 20th - ranked Berhow has done just that .
Thanks to his newly developed aggressive style , he recorded a pair of major decisions last weekend against Arizona State and Michigan State and will look to build off that success against Penn StateâÄôs Cameron Wade and Ohio StateâÄôs No. 17 Corey Morrison .
Berhow and Morrison met in early December in the quarterfinals of the Las Vegas Invitational , where Morrison prevailed 9 - 4 .
This weekend , rematches are the rule , not the exception .
And a number of the rematches are sure to provide some fireworks .
For the second straight Sunday , Ness will face the top - ranked wrestler at 133 .
The BuckeyesâÄô Reece Humphrey is 19 - 0 and edged Ness 5 - 4 at the National Duals , but Ness will try to build off last weekendâÄôs 6 - 5 decision over then - No. 1 Franklin Gomez of Michigan State and knock Humprhey off his post .
Thorn meanwhile will get a third shot at defending national champion J Jaggers at 141 .
TheyâÄôve split their first two matchups this season , with Thorn edging Jaggers 5 - 3 at the Las Vegas Invite and Jaggers returning the favor with a 7 - 2 decision at the National Duals .

American adults are liars , at least when it comes to washing their hands .
In a recent telephone survey , 91 percent of the subjects claimed they always washed their hands after using public restrooms .
But , when researchers observed people leaving public restrooms , only 83 percent actually did so .
Only 75 percent of men washed their hands compared to 90 percent of women , the observations revealed .
The telephone survey also turned up several other results – some surprising , some not .
While 83 percent said they washed their hands after using a home bathroom , 73 percent washed their hands after changing a diaper .
In contrast , low percentages of people wash their hands after petting a cat or dog ( 43 percent ) , after handling money ( 21 percent ) , after sneezing or coughing ( 32 percent ) .
" Only 24 percent of men and 39 percent of women say they always wash their hands after coughing or sneezing , " said Brian Sansoni of the Soap and Detergent Association ( SDA ) .
" We have to do a better job here in stopping the spread of the germs that make us sick . "
These results were released by the American Society for Microbiology ( ASM ) and the SDA to highlight National Clean Hands Week , which runs from Sept. 18 through the 24 .
" Although many Americans are beginning to recognize the importance of washing their hands , we still need to reach many others , " said Judy Daly , Secretary of the ASM .
" Our message is clear : one of the most effective tools in preventing the spread of infection is literally at our fingertips . "
Bacteria and viruses for the common cold and influenza spread much more often through hand contact than by airborne transmission through coughing or sneezing .
Fifteen seconds of scrubbing with soap and water or a good rubbing with a hand sanitizer greatly reduce the amount of infective crud on your hands .
The study , done in four American cities , was carried out in August by Harris Interactive .
The results were announced today .
Observers were stationed at Turner Field in Atlanta , the Museum of Science and Industry and the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago , Grand Central Station and Penn Station in New York , and the Ferry Terminal Farmers Market in San Francisco .
They observed 3,206 men and 3,310 women .
Here 's some of what they saw :
Sports fans at Turner Field , particularly the guys , had the worst hand hygiene habits –only 74 percent of all patrons washed their hands ( 84 percent of the women and 63 percent of the men ) .
Results from the New York train stations provided the biggest gender split – 92 percent of the women washed their hands compared to only 64 percent of the men .
San Francisco turned out to be the most hygiene - conscious city in the study – 88 percent of the market goers washed their hands after using the facilities .
You might be wondering how the observations were handled .
The observers were instructed to spend time combing their hair or putting on makeup and to rotate bathrooms every hour or so , and were only allowed to wash their hands 10 percent of the time .

Feynman on Hawking
Several conversations that Feynman and I had involved the remarkable abilities of other physicists .
In one of these conversations , I remarked to Feynman that I was impressed by Steven Hawking 's ability to do path integration in his head .
Ahh , that 's not so great , Feynman replied .
It 's much more interesting to come up with the technique like I did , rather than to be able to do the mechanics in your head .
Feynman was n't being immodest , he was quite right .
The true secret to genius is in creativity , not in technical mechanics .
Back to the top
Murray and Richard
Once I made the mistake of inviting both Feynman and Murray Gell - Mann over for dinner with a couple of other guests .
Almost the entire evening was spent with the two of them sparing back and forth , You do n't have to say that , I already know that .
Then the other one would say something , and again , You do n't have to say that , I already know that .
Back and forth it went .
My wife Laura turned to Gweneth Feynman , and said , Why do they even bother ?
Gweneth responded ,
We try to keep them apart as much as possible .
Later that evening , we were all sitting around the table talking when someone said something and Murray Gell - Mann remarked , Oh , that 's a pleonasm .
Everyone went , What ?
It 's a sentence with a triple redundancy , Gell - Mann stated .
Gell - Mann is well known among his associates for his pedantic knowledge of language and facts .
Feynman and I sneaked into my library where we looked it up in the dictionary .
Gell - Mann was right .
Feynman hit his fist on the table , and exclaimed , DAMN IT !
He 's always GODDAMNED right , always !
Let 's see if we can catch him tonight , I replied .
Later in the evening , the subject of antiquarian books on witchcraft came up and Gell - Mann said , Do you know the Malleus Maleficarum written by James I in 1623 ?
No , Murray , the Malleus Maleficarum was written by Sprenger and Kramer in 1486 , James I wrote the Demonology in 1597 , I said authoritatively .
Gell - Mann , looking very astonished , turned and said , WHAT ?
At that moment there was the great beginnings of a smile on Dick 's face , but it had n't been proved yet .
Gell - Mann again said , WHAT ?
I pulled out my Encyclopedia on Witchcraft and verified the titles , authors , and dates .
Feynman slid under the table laughing , and roaring , Let the trumpets roar and the angles sing !
I 'll never let you forget this , Murray !
I knew it was an act all along !
Back to the top
Surely You 're Joking , Mr. Gell - Mann !
This took place just after the publication of Surely You 're Joking , Mr. Feynman .
We were all sitting together at lunch talking about the success of the book , when one of the other graduate students remarked that they had not seen Murray Gell - Mann lately .
I thought he had gone and started writing his own book of anecdotes .
The other student remarked , Yeah , and I know what he is going to call it too , ' Damn it Murray , You 're right again ! '
At this remark , Feynman lost it , and slid under the table laughing .
There was another lunch conversation that involved Gell - Mann that took place right after the publication of Surely You 're Joking .
Gell - Mann , who I was quite friendly with too , confided to me that he was very upset with Feynman 's written account of their joint discovery of the theory of beta decay .
He felt that Feynman had not reported the account accurately and was giving himself undue credit .
At lunch the mood was jovial , and I took the occasion to pass along Gell - Mann 's feelings about the controversial passage .
Feynman 's smile immediately disappeared .
He looked rather sad and hurt .
This was the first time he had heard Gell - Mann 's reaction to the book .
You know , I tried extra hard , very hard in fact , in the passages I wrote about Murray .
I was especially careful .
Apparently , Gell - Mann was indeed upset , and there are published accounts of various explosions on the fourth floor of the physics building where they had offices close together .
Feynman did indeed change the passage to suit Gell - Mann 's wishes .

The Amazing Randi Meets The Chief
Back in 1984 Feynman attended a lecture at Caltech given by James Amazing Randi , a well known magician and debunker of psychics .
At this lecture , Randi performed a very good mental trick involving a newspaper and a prediction contained in an envelope pasted to the blackboard .
The next evening , Randi and Feynman were at my house for dinner .
It was a delightful and fun evening with lots of jokes and laughter all around .
At about 1:30 a.m. , Feynman and Randi still going strong , Feynman decided to figure out how Randi did his mental trick .
Oh , no .
You can't solve that trick .
You do n't have enough information !
Randi exclaimed .
What do you mean ?
Physicists never have enough information , Feynman responded .
Feynman began to stare off into space with Randi muttering on how he would not be able to solve it .
Step by step , Feynman went through the process out loud and told Randi how the trick must have been done .
Randi literally fell backwards over his chair and exclaimed , You did n't fall off no apple cart !
You did n't get that Swedish Prize for nothing !
Feynman roared with laughter .
Later , on another visit to Caltech , Randi once again joined us for lunch .
He did another trick for Feynman , this time a card trick .
I DELIBERATELY misled you this time !
Randi stated .
Feynman paid him no attention .
In less than three minutes , Feynman solved the trick .
I 'm never going to show you another trick again !
declared a frustrated Randi .

The Supernatural Clock
Once we were talking about the supernatural and the following anecdote involving his first wife Arline came up .
Arline had tuberculosis and was confined to a hospital while Feynman was at Los Alamos .
Next to her bed was an old clock .
Arline told Feynman that the clock was a symbol of the time that they had together and that he should always remember that .
Always look at the clock to remember the time we have together , she said .
The day that Arline died in the hospital , Feynman was given a note from the nurse that indicated the time of death .
Feynman noted that the clock had stopped at exactly that time .
It was as the clock , which had been a symbol of their time together , had stopped at the moment of her death .
Did you make a connection ?
I asked NO !
NOT FOR A SECOND !
I immediately began to think how this could have happened .
And I realized that the clock was old and was always breaking .
That the clock probably stopped some time before and the nurse coming in to the room to record the time of death would have looked at the clock and jotted down the time from that .
I never made any supernatural connection , not even for a second .
I just wanted to figure out how it happened .

Gossip
One evening Feynman and I arrived early at a lecture at Caltech .
We were sitting in the seats and gossiping about things of really no consequence whatever , when he heard these students come in and whisper , Hey , look it 's Feynman !
I bet they are discussing something really important !

Because I Am Richard Feynman
Feynman and I would sometimes go camping together .
On these occasions he would drive his van , which had Feynman diagrams painted all over it and a license plate that said Quantum .
( Murray Gell - Mann had a license plate that said Quarks . )
I asked Feynman if anyone ever recognized the diagrams .
Yes .
Once we were driving in the midwest and we pulled into a McDonald's .
Someone came up to me and asked me why I have Feynman diagrams all over my van .
I replied , ' Because I AM Feynman !
The young man went " Ahhhhh ..... "

A Visit to Penn and Teller
Penn and Teller are well known as The Bad Boys of Magic and are among today 's most popular magicians appearing on many light night TV shows , acts in Las Vegas , and so forth .
There was a time , however , when they were still unknown and they had a little known stage show in Los Angeles .
I thought they were really funny and clever .
They had a hard time getting people to come to their show and , being friends with them , they would call me up and tell me to bring my friends .
I convinced Feynman , Al Hibbs , and Tom Van Sant ( Feynman 's artist friend ) to accompany me to the show .
The show was excellent and we all had a good time .
I tried to get Penn to understand who Feynman was and that he should pay him some attention , but Penn did n't realize who I had brought at that time , so there was not much interaction .
This was too bad , as Feynman really enjoyed the show .
After the show , we went out to a nearby cafe and all of us tried to figure out the tricks .
There was one that involved a cutting of a rose 's shadow that had everyone going for some time , but this time , the solution was not arrived at .

A Kooky Phone Call
On another occasion I was with both Gell - Mann and Feynman and the subject of kooky letters and phone calls came up .
Feynman started relating the story of how one crazy woman called the office about some ridiculous theory of magnetic fields .
He just could not get her off the phone .
Gell - Mann responded , Oh , I remember that woman .
I got her off the phone in less than a minute .
How'd you do that ?
Feynman asked .
I told her to call you .
That you were the resident expert in the topic !

A Bump on the Head
In the beginning part of 1984 , Feynman was teaching a course on computing at Caltech .
The course was also co-jointly taught by Gerald Sussman from MIT .
On one occasion Feynman was lecturing at the blackboard , but this time Sussman kept coming up and correcting him .
Later that week Feynman was supposed to come over for dinner .
On the night in question , Feynman 's wife Gweneth called to say that Feynman was in the hospital and that they would not be able to come over .
She told me not to tell anyone , as she did n't want the word to get around .
Apparently Feynman in his excitement to purchase a new computer tripped on the sidewalk curb and hit his head .
This caused some internal complications and bleeding .
In a week or so , Feynman was back on his feet and returned to class .
At lunch Feynman related what had happened .
After bumping his head , he paid little or no attention to it .
He was bleeding when he entered the computer store .
What was interesting is that he gradually began to loose his sense of what was happening around him without internally realizing it .
First , he could n't locate his car .
Then he had a very strange session with one of his artistic models .
And on another day , he told his secretary Helen Tuck that he was going home , and proceeded to undress and lie down in his office .
He forgot that he was to give a lecture at Hughs aircraft , and so on ...
Everything was just rationalized away .
But you know , he said , NO ONE told me I was going crazy .
Now why not ?
I said , Come on .
You are always doing weird stuff .
Besides there such a fine line between genius and madness that it sometimes difficult to tell !
Listen , ape , the next time I go crazy around here , you be sure to tell me !

The Johnny Carson Show
After Surely
You 're Joking became a best - seller , Feynman was invited to do an appearance on the well - known Johnny Carson show .
A number of us were sitting around at dinner when the topic of the invitation came up .
Feynman stated that was unfamiliar with the show and was debating whether or not he should go on .
Everyone there started putting on the hard sell .
Al Hibbs discussed the excellence of the show and that he had appeared on it several times discussing various space exploration missions by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
Carson is a science buff , he exclaimed .
Others joined in the choir of approval .
I turned to Feynman and said , Watch it first .
Watch it before you make any sort of commitment .
He turned to me and said , That 's the first wise thing I have heard on this topic .
A few days later Feynman spotted me walking across the campus and demanded I come over .
What ?
YOU WERE RIGHT !
I watched that show and it was the most idiotic program I have ever seen .
I would have walked off it in the middle .

Penrose and Feynman
Not long ago I gave a lecture at Oxford University .
While I was there I had the good fortune to have a long lunch with physicist / mathematician Roger Penrose , who is responsible for much of our understanding of black holes .
The topic of Feynman came up and Penrose related the following story : A while back he was visiting Caltech with Steven Hawking .
Hawking asked Penrose if there was anyone at Caltech that he wanted to meet .
The choice obviously came down to either Feynman or Gell - Mann .
Penrose decided they should try to get a hold of Feynman .
Hawking called up the office , but Feynman was n't in .
He was on vacation .
It turns out , however , he was vacationing at his home .
Hawking called Feynman at home and Feynman reluctantly agreed to come over the next day .
The subject of quantum gravity came up and Penrose and Feynman got into a heated argument .
Penrose said , Feynman was so quick , he was usually about five steps ahead of me at any given point .
Sometimes he did n't listen to what I was saying .
The whole thing was mentally exhausting .
I was completely drained at the end of the session .
I have never encountered anyone so quick before .
What Penrose and many other physicists did n't realize was the reason that accounted for Feynman 's quickness on many matters in physics .
Feynman thought about some of these areas in great depth and for long periods of time .
A topic like quantum gravity would be one that Feynman had spent countless hours thinking about .
It was n't all off the cuff .

Few species on Earth communicate as frequently and effectively as human beings , and none so majestically or ubiquitously as whales .
Immersed in an environment rich in sound but poor in light , whales and dolphins developed complex communication systems that they use to mate , feed , socialize , and navigate .
The “ vocabulary ” of some types of whales such as the beluga and humpback is expansive , and rivals most non-humans creatures .
Others can communicate over vast distances across the abyss .
And , while not strictly communication , many dolphin and whale species use advanced echolocation to hunt and navigate .
The means and ends of these communications are most astounding to humans perhaps because we are accustomed to viewing communication as a sign of intelligence , and probably most people believe that humans are the only truly intelligent species on this planet .
One way scientists attempt to quantify the intelligence of a species is to measure the ratio between brain size and body mass and compare it to that of a human .
While no species matches human brain proportionately , some whale species come very close .
Scientists do not agree on the exact level of intelligence of whales , but there are some truly astounding examples of whale communication that provide strong evidence in their favor .
Many species of whales hunt prey in groups called pods , and communication plays a vital role in their success .
Some pods of humpback whales , including those from the Chatham Strait in Glacier Bay , Alaska , use a fascinating technique called bubble net hunting .
When one member of the pod detects a school of prey fish it emits a feeding call that both the fish and the whale pod members respond to .
The fish shy away from the feeding call while the pod members position themselves underneath the school .
Using enormous gulps of air from the surface , the pod circles the school blowing streams of bubbles that form a curtain around the fish .
The curtain confuses the fish and they become trapped inside it .
Communicating acoustically the entire time , members of the pod take turns swimming vertically through the center of the bubble curtain and swallowing hundreds of fish before surfacing , sometimes spectacularly .
Long before the internet and television , before Bell summoned Watson in that first telephone call , even before Marconi invented the radio and Morse the telegraph , whales were calling each other literally from opposite ends of the oceans .
This amazing discovery was made using the US Navy ’s Sound Surveillance System ( SOSUS ) that was installed to track and monitor Soviet subs during the Cold War .
It turns out that SOSUS can track whales just as well as it can submarines .
SOSUS data showed that a single whale in the Atlantic Ocean could call to others across nearly the entire ocean .
Long - term records have also showed that this distance has decreased over time as shipping traffic has increased .
Scientists estimate that doubling shipping traffic has nearly halved the distance over which whales can effectively communicate .
Researchers suspect that prior to propeller - powered shipping , whales could call across entire oceans and even from one ocean basin to another .
These long - distance communications are carried along a natural underwater network of acoustic waveguides .
Sound traveling deep in the ocean is bent by changes in the speed of sound , just as light is bent when it enters the water .
The speed of sound in the ocean depends on varying conditions such as temperature , pressure , and salinity .
At certain depths and locations , sound waves travel along channels called “ acoustic waveguides ” because sounds waves attempting to radiate away from the channel are bent back toward it by changes in the sound speed around the waveguide .
SOSUS relies on these waveguides to detect Russian submarines , and whales rely on them for communication and navigation .
Like most natural systems on the Earth , waveguides are constantly evolving and are affected by the Earth ’s climate , so communication may have been very different during the last ice age than it is today .
Most whale communications are brief and simple , but in 1971 researchers Roger Payne and Scott McVay realized that the song of the humpback whales was something altogether different .
In one of nature ’s most impressive migrations , each year humpback whales travel from the rich summer feeding grounds of the Arctic seas to the warmer , safer waters of the West Indies and Hawaiian Islands to mate and breed during the winter .
There the males sink to a depth of several hundred feet , position themselves with their fins rigidly pointed forward , and begin to sing .
The whales sing across nearly the entire range of human hearing with a vocal range no human could match .
They lack vocal chords , so they probably create the sounds by circulating air through their respiratory systems .
But during their singing they do not move their mouths , and no air leaves their blowholes either .
Nevertheless , the whales ’ remarkable musical instrument can be heard as much as 20 miles away .
Their songs are organized in a “ Russian doll ” hierarchy beginning with single units or notes that are grouped in sub-phrases that last approximately ten seconds long .
Two sub-phrases comprise a phrase that is repeated for several minutes as a single theme .
When one theme is complete , the whales will sing another , and another , continuing for about thirty minutes .
This collection of themes makes up a whale song that the male repeats frequently for hours or even days .
Researchers do not know the precise reason for the humpback whale song , but it is suspected to simultaneously attract females and ward off competitor males .
What they do know is that these songs do not remain constant throughout the season .
The males listen to each other and adjust their songs over the course of the mating season and throughout the years .
New songs form gradually , and while they may contain themes from previous songs , the old songs will not be repeated .
Whales from different areas sing in different “ dialects ” that may reflect the local conditions of each population , and the unique evolution of their songs .
Whale songs became a popular cultural icon in the 1970s as albums of recorded songs were best - sellers in record stores , and the two Voyager spacecraft were launched carrying gold - plated records with recorded whale songs .
Many younger folks , like myself , may have been first exposed to humpback whale songs by Star Trek IV : The Voyage Home .
The popularity of humpback whale songs ( and others , such as a type of Indian Ocean blue whale ) created a great deal of popular support for the “ Save the Whales ” campaign .
Proponents ( and the Star Trek writers ) claimed the songs implied that the whales were fellow intelligent creatures , while scientists in whaling nations have played down these notions and equated them with the mooing of a terrestrial cow .
Either way , they must be heard to be fully appreciated .

Indian prisons are overcrowded ( Pic : Prashant Ravi ]
Under the Indian Penal Code , these offences can lead to a maximum sentence of one year in prison or a $ 45 fine or both .
But Yadav , now in his 70s , has been languishing on remand in the state for more than 20 years .
An amendment to existing prison laws , however , promises to come to his help .
Under the provision , inmates must be released if they have served time on remand equal to half the maximum prison tariff for the offence they are to be tried for .
The measure , which came into effect last weekend , does not apply to those charged with offences for which the death sentence is a possible punishment .
Authorities and human rights activists reckon that the law will help speed up justice and free up India 's overcrowded prisons .
Jaldhar Yadav is not alone in his misery - 87 % of prisoners in Bihar 's prisons are on remand awaiting trial .
In the central prison in the town of Bhagalpur , where Yadav is being held , there are some 15 remand prisoners , all above 70 years of age .
Yadav 's plight exemplifies the fate of seven out of 10 Indian prisoners - nearly 70 % of 322,000 inmates in India 's 1,135 prisons are awaiting trial .
This is higher than South Asian neighbours , Bangladesh ( 67 % ) , Pakistan ( 66 % ) and Sri Lanka ( 49.3 % ) .
India jails 31 people per 100,000 of population , compared with a figure of 145 per 100,000 in England and Wales .
But only 17.3 % of inmates in England and Wales are on remand .
Shortage of judges
Machang Lalung spent more than half a century in prison without trial
Most of Bihar 's 55 jails , for example , simply do not have enough prison vans to transport prisoners to the courts .
Trials also drag on because of a shortage of judges - India has only 10.5 judges per million people .
Since 1987 , the government has been talking about increasing the ratio to 50 judges per million , but it has not happened .
India 's National Police Commission has said 60 % of arrests are either unnecessary or unjustified as police see imprisonment as an easy solution to check spiralling crime .
According to one human rights group , the majority of court hearings are also ineffective .
INDIA'S PRISONS
There are 322,000 inmates in 1,135 prisons in India India 's prisons officially have capacity for 237,000 223,000 of inmates are on remand
The absence of witnesses impeded another 15 % of hearings , while the absence of the accused a further 10 % .
No wonder then that India is rife with sorry tales of remand prisoners being released after wasting away their entire lives in jails .
In February , Jagjivan Ram Yadav , detained without trial for 38 years in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh , was freed on bail by the country 's Supreme Court .
Yadav , arrested for allegedly killing a neighbour 's wife in 1968 , was never charged .
Police admitted to losing the case records .
Grey area
In January , 70 - year - old Machang Lalung , a villager in north - eastern Assam state , was released from prison after spending more than half a century behind bars without trial .
Many prisoners suffer from serious diseases ( Pic : Prashant Ravi ]
It is difficult to predict how big an effect the new law might have on India 's congested prisons .
The chief of prisons in the eastern state of West Bengal , BD Sharma , reckons that " five to 10 % of the inmates " might be released .
" There are some grey areas which need to be checked - like most of the time , an accused has different cases under separate sections slapped on him .
" If you add all the potential sentences up , and then you halve that , it may still be a long time before an under - trial can be released , " he says .
But the new law is at least a glimmer of hope for people like Jaldhar Yadav , Charitra Mondal , Sheikh Samshul and Maksudan Sah - ageing prisoners who have spent over two decades in India 's prisons without ever being convicted .
The road to Dover .
In 1968 , the US Supreme Court unanimously ruled that an Arkansas law banning the teaching of evolution violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution .
The Court ruled that the Arkansas law had a religious purpose — namely , to oppose teachings perceived to conflict with the biblical story of creation .
Following this defeat , opponents of evolution adopted two strategies .
First , they advocated the teaching of creationism as an alternative scientific explanation , along with evolution .
Second , they began to adopt scientific jargon to give creationism a veneer of science .
Two states , Arkansas and Louisiana , passed laws mandating this “ balanced ” treatment of evolution and creationism .
This set the stage for the Arkansas trial of 1982 ( McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education ) , which was almost entirely focused on the question “ Is creationism science ? ” Judge William R. Overton stated in his opinion ( 6 ) that creationism fails to be a science because it fails to satisfy the following requirements : “ ( a ) it is guided by natural law ; ( b ) it has to be explanatory by reference to natural law ; ( c ) it is testable against the empirical world ; ( d ) its conclusions are tentative , i.e. are not necessarily the final word ; and ( e ) it is falsifiable . ”
The issue returned to the Supreme Court in 1986 – 1987 .
The Court ruled 7 – 2 in Edwards v. Aguillard that Louisiana ’s law calling for the balanced treatment of evolution ( “ evolution - science ” and “ creation - science ” ) violated the First Amendment “ because it lacks a clear secular purpose ” and it “ impermissibly endorses religion by advancing the religious belief that a supernatural being created humankind ” ( 7 ) .
The creationists once again mutated and adapted .
After the Edwards ruling , they set about removing references to God and creationism from their tracts .
For example , as revealed at the Dover trial ( 8 ) , the authors of the intelligent design ( ID ) text Of pandas and people : the central question of biological origins stripped the direct mentions of creationism present in early drafts of the text and systematically substituted the novel term “ intelligent design ” ( 9 ) .
The evolution of creationism .
ID is the contemporary version of an argument that has a long history .
It was given a succinct formulation by William Paley in the early 19th century .
Modern defenders of the design argument contend that living things are too complex to have evolved by the process of natural selection ; rather , their “ irreducible complexity ” is convincing evidence of the hand of an intelligent designer .
ID theory ’s contemporary advocates , who include Lehigh University biochemistry professor Michael Behe , cite complex systems such as the blood - clotting cascade , the flagellar motor , and the human eye to argue that because these systems would be nonfunctional if even a single component part were excised , they could not have evolved by mutation / natural selection and therefore must have been “ intelligently designed . ”
The argument can be boiled down to this : complexity is itself evidence of a designer .
In its current version , ID conveniently omits mention of God .
However , ID is not a scientific theory .
The premise for the arguments of Behe and other ID proponents is deeply flawed , scientifically and philosophically .
Behe assumes that the component parts of irreducibly complex systems never had other functions in older organisms .
This is contradicted by scientific evidence .
The Dover trial transcripts are illuminating ( see “ The Dover trial ” ) ( 8 ) .
Under oath , Behe was forced to concede that there are organisms that lack some of the mammalian clotting proteins .
Proteins that are present in the flagellar motor have orthologs that are involved in unrelated functions .
A recent elegant example of proteins acquiring a new function within a complex system can be seen in a structure that functioned in respiration in fish and later evolved to be part of the mammalian inner ear ( 10 ) .
ID makes no testable predictions .
There is nothing in this concept that allows for scientific investigation of the “ designer . ”
It is simply an argument by default ; the failure to explain something is said to lend credence to a supernatural explanation .
The attempt to promote this as science is deeply misguided .
In spite of uncounted hundreds of thousands of scientific studies published in the last 50 years , there are still demonstrable gaps in what we know about the evolution of life on this planet .
However , those studies tell us a great deal about how life came to be as it is and now form the foundation of modern biology .
ID , by contrast , has produced nothing .
The Discovery Institute .
The engine behind the ID movement is the Discovery Institute , founded in 1990 by Bruce K. Chapman .
Today , the institute receives more than $ 4 million per year from numerous foundations , most with religious missions .
The center ’s objectives are outlined in its “ Wedge Strategy , ” which was leaked and posted on the Internet ( 11 ) .
The document states that the Discovery Institute “ seeks nothing less than the overthrow of materialism and its cultural legacies ” and “ to replace materialistic explanations with theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God . ”
Its goals are to see ID theory as the dominant perspective in science ; to see design theory applied in specific fields , including molecular biology , biochemistry , paleontology , physics , and cosmology in the natural sciences and ethics , politics , theology , and philosophy in the humanities ; to see its influence in the fine arts ; and to see design theory permeate our religious , cultural , moral , and political life .
The Dover decision .
In Dover , Pennsylvania , 2005 , 11 parents sued to reverse a school board requirement that the following statement be read to students : “ because Darwin ’s
Theory is a theory , it continues to be tested as new evidence is discovered .
The Theory is not a fact .
Gaps in the Theory exist for which there is no evidence .
A theory is defined as a well - tested explanation that unifies a broad range of observations ” ( Kitzmiller et al. v. Dover Area School District ) ( 12 ) .
The required statement referred only to evolution .
The third paragraph in the statement read : “ Intelligent design is an explanation of the origin of life that differs from Darwin ’s view .
The reference book , Of pandas and people ( 9 ) , is available for students who might be interested in gaining an understanding of what intelligent design actually involves . ”
In his decision , Judge John E. Jones stated that ID is essentially Paley ’s argument for the existence of God , with God left unmentioned .
In short , ID is a religious doctrine .
He noted that Behe “ claims that the plausibility argument for ID depends upon the extent to which one believes in the existence of God ” ; thus , “ ID is a religious and not a scientific proposition . ”
He characterized ID as “ nothing less than the progeny of creationism . ”
Jones stated that the Dover school statement forces a “ false duality ” on students by making them choose between God / ID and atheism / science and “ singles out the theory of evolution for special treatment , misrepresents its status in the scientific community , causes students to doubt its validity without scientific justification , presents students with a religious alternative masquerading as a scientific theory , directs them to consult a creationist text as though it were a science resource , and instructs students to forego scientific inquiry in the public school classroom and instead to seek out religious instruction elsewhere . ”
The Dover case was an important victory for science education .
Judge Jones wrote a strongly worded , carefully crafted opinion that should guide future litigation ( 12 ) .
The transcripts of the Dover trial constitute an excellent educational resource , rich in testimony about the nature of science , the evidence for evolution , and the history of deceit in the creationism / ID movement .
Virus writers have developed a worm that spoofs the behaviour of internet search engine Google , varying the results displayed to suit the requirements of hackers .
P2 Load - A modifies the HOSTS file on infected PCs by replacing the original with a file downloaded from a remote website under the control of hackers .
When users run a search , the results are normally shown correctly - but sponsored links are different .
For some searches , other links appear which have been specified by the creator of this malware , resulting in increased traffic to these websites .
The changes in behaviour happen because users are not getting their results from Google but from a hacker - controlled website based in Germany .
P2 Load - A also modifies a user 's start page .
Spanish anti-virus firm Panda reports the page is an almost exact copy of Google , which supports the 17 languages of Google and redirects users even if they make a mistake when entering the address , such as ' wwwgoogle.com ' .
" Its [ P2 Load 's ] aims are none other than to increase visits to the pages linked by the creator of this malware or earn an income from companies that want to appear in the first few results in computer where the identity of Google has been spoofed , " said Luis Corrons , director of PandaLabs .
" In both cases , the motivation of the author of this malware is purely financial . "
The worm spreads across file trading networks , targeting users of the Shareaza and Imesh P2P programs .
P2 Load - A copies itself to the shared directory of these programs as an executable file called Knights of the Old Republic 2 , a reference to a well - known computer game related to the Star Wars saga .
If this file is run , it displays an error message informing the user that a file does not exist and offering to download it .
Meanwhile , unknown to its user , their Windows PC will have become infected .
PandaLabs has warned both the ISP hosting the page and Google in order to take measures and neutralise the attack .
P2 Load - A uses techniques for fooling users into visiting untrusted web sites more commonly seen in pharming attacks against DNS servers .
Although it is rare for malware to change the HOSTS file of infected PCs the tactic is not unprecedented and has generated alerts from Australian consumer security firm PC Tools and others since the start of the year .
Florida county plans to vaporize landfill trash FORT PIERCE , Fla . ( AP )  A Florida county has grand plans to ditch its dump , generate electricity and help build roads — all by vaporizing garbage at temperatures hotter than the sun .
The $ 425 million facility expected to be built in St. Lucie County will use lightning - like plasma arcs to turn trash into gas and rock - like material .
It will be the first such plant in the nation operating on such a massive scale and the largest in the world .
Supporters say the process is cleaner than traditional trash incineration , though skeptics question whether the technology can meet the lofty expectations .
The 100,000 - square - foot plant , slated to be operational in two years , is expected to vaporize 3,000 tons of garbage a day .
County officials estimate their entire landfill — 4.3 million tons of trash collected since 1978 — will be gone in 18 years .
No byproduct will go unused , according to Geoplasma , the Atlanta - based company building and paying for the plant .
Synthetic , combustible gas produced in the process will be used to run turbines to create about 120 megawatts of electricity that will be sold back to the grid .
The facility will operate on about a third of the power it generates , free from outside electricity .
About 80,000 pounds of steam per day will be sold to a neighboring Tropicana Products Inc. facility to power the juice plant 's turbines .
Sludge from the county 's wastewater treatment plant will be vaporized , and a material created from melted organic matter — up to 600 tons a day — will be hardened into slag , and sold for use in road and construction projects .
" This is sustainability in its truest and finest form , " said Hilburn Hillestad , president of Geoplasma , a subsidiary of Jacoby Development Inc .
For years , some waste - management facilities have been converting methane — created by rotting trash in landfills — to power .
Others also burn trash to produce electricity .
But experts say population growth will limit space available for future landfills .
" We 've only got the size of the planet , " said Richard Tedder , program administrator for the Florida Department of Environmental Protection 's solid waste division .
" Because of all of the pressures of development , people do n't want landfills .
It 's going to be harder and harder to site new landfills , and it 's going to be harder for existing landfills to continue to expand . "
The plasma-arc gasification facility in St. Lucie County , on central Florida 's Atlantic Coast , aims to solve that problem by eliminating the need for a landfill .
Only two similar facilities are operating in the world — both in Japan — but are gasifying garbage on a much smaller scale .
Up to eight plasma arc - equipped cupolas will vaporize trash year - round , non-stop .
Garbage will be brought in on conveyor belts and dumped into the cylindrical cupolas where it falls into a zone of heat more than 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit .
" We did n't want to do it like everybody else , " said Leo Cordeiro , the county 's solid waste director .
" We knew there were better ways . "
No emissions are released during the closed - loop gasification , Geoplasma says .
The only emissions will come from the synthetic gas - powered turbines that create electricity .
Even that will be cleaner than burning coal or natural gas , experts say .
Few other toxins will be generated , if any at all , Geoplasma says .
But critics disagree .
" We 've found projects similar to this being misrepresented all over the country , " said Monica Wilson of the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives .
Wilson said there are n't enough studies yet to prove the company 's claims that emissions will likely be less than from a standard natural - gas power plant .
She also said other companies have tried to produce such results and failed .
She cited two similar facilities run by different companies in Australia and Germany that closed after failing to meet emissions standards .
" I think this is the time for the residents of this county to start asking some tough questions , " Wilson said .
Bruce Parker , president and CEO of the Washington , D.C. - based National Solid Wastes Management Association , scoffs at the notion that plasma technology will eliminate the need for landfills .
" We do know that plasma arc is a legitimate technology , but let 's see first how this thing works for St. Lucie County , " Parker said .
" It 's too soon for people to make wild claims that we wo n't need landfills . "
Louis Circeo , director of Georgia
Tech 's plasma research division , said that as energy prices soar and landfill fees increase , plasma -arc technology will become more affordable .
" Municipal solid waste is perhaps the largest renewable energy resource that is available to us , " Circeo said , adding that the process " could not only solve the garbage and landfill problems in the United States and elsewhere , but it could significantly alleviate the current energy crisis . "
He said that if large plasma facilities were put to use nationwide to vaporize trash , they could theoretically generate electricity equivalent to about 25 nuclear power plants .
Americans generated 236 million tons of garbage in 2003 , about 4.5 pounds per person , per day , according to the latest figures from the Environmental Protection Agency .
Roughly 130 million tons went to landfills — enough to cover a football field 703 miles high with garbage .
Circeo said criticism of the technology is based on a lack of understanding .
" We are going to put emissions out , but the emissions are much lower than virtually any other process , especially a combustion process in an incinerator , " he said .
Circeo said that both plants operating in Japan , where emissions standards are more stringent than in the U.S. , are producing far less pollution than regulations require .
" For the amount of energy produced , you get significantly less of certain pollutants like sulfur dioxide and particulate matter , " said Rick Brandes , chief of the Environmental Protection Agency 's waste minimization division .
Geoplasma expects to recoup its $ 425 million investment , funded by bonds , within 20 years through the sale of electricity and slag .
" That 's the silver lining , " said Hillestad , adding that St. Lucie County wo n't pay a dime .
The company has assumed full responsibility for interest on the bonds .
County Commissioner Chris Craft said the plasma process " is bigger than just the disposal of waste for St. Lucie County . "
" It addresses two of the world 's largest problems — how to deal with solid waste and the energy needs of our communities , " Craft said .
" This is the end of the rainbow .
It will change the world . "

January 19 , 2006 — jao
… but not simpler .
Einstein ’s ( attributed ) quotation has become an aphorism , taken for granted by every mathematician or physicist i’ve ever met ( to mention two kinds of people i’ve been frequently involved with ) .
One would expect the same attitude from a community that invented the term ‘ no silver bullet ’ , and yet , since i got into computer science , first for fun and later on for a living , i’ve found lots of people with , er , a different viewpoint .
Take for instance this excerpt from Lisp is sin , a widely cited and commented article by Sriram Krisnan :
In Visual Studio , we look at 3 distinct categories of programmers .
We call them Mort , Elvis and Einstein – the 3 personas we take into consideration whenever we create any developer technology .
What is difficult for some of us geeks to comprehend sometimes is – all 3 of them are equally important .
When you look at technology like Windows Workflow Foundation , one of the driving forces was to let non-geeks build software .
Not everyone needs to be a Raymond Chen or a Dave Cutler .
Not everyone needs to understand the difference between the various GC algorithms .
However , everyone needs the ability to be productive .
And everyone needs to be able to get software working without needing a CS degree .
We cannot afford to restrict software development only to those who know Windows kernel internals or those who can understand what a continuation is .
It ’s not that other people are not smart – they just have better things to do .
That ’s the key piece of understanding I find missing sometimes .
Nonsense , if you ask me .
And yet , i’ve been hearing this same argument , in different dressings , once and again since i got into computer science .
Let ’s apply the same line of reasoning to other disciplines , and see how well it fares :
Hey Albert , your General Relativity is awesome but , you know , with all that jazz about differential geometry and curved spacetimes , it ’s too hard ; we ’re not as smart as you , pal , so we ’d better use Newtonian or Aristotelian mechanics to calculate those GPS satellite orbits and get going with other important things we need to do .
Hope you understand , Albert .
Well Santiago , your ideas about neurons and surgery sound pretty deep and mystifying , but please , think of the Galens among us : we do n’t have the time to investigate every new fad , and , anyway , we would n’t understand it if we did .
Know what ?
We ’ll keep using our old good cures and stay away from untrodden venues .
Our healing parchments are a bit of a hack , but they get the work done … most of the time , that is .
Does it make any sense ?
Now , maybe you think that i am exaggerating , and that the comparisons above are stretching the point a bit too far .
If so , take a second to look back to the people that made your nice computing environment possible .
Take a look at Charles Babagge visions ; read about Alan Turing and Alonzo Church or John von Neumann ; admire the elegance of McCarthy ’s original LISP ( 1960 ) ; prepare to be surprised with the things the people in Dough Engelbart ’s Augmentation Research Center were doing during the sixties ; try to find a modern drawing program that matches Sketchpad ‘s algorithms ( or see it in action in this presentation by Alan Kay ) ; follow the fascinating development of the overlapping windows interface , hand in hand with Smalltalk history back at Xerox PARC , and do it from the horse ’s mouth ; feel the thrill of the people that went beyond Xerox ’s big wigs ’ shortsightedness and on to making a dent in the universe : it was 1984 , that same year the lisp machine wars culminated in the creation of the GNU project , which was all about ideals , about empowering people , about freedom .
When you ’re done , tell me whether i’m going overboard when making parallelisms between computer science and physics or medicine !
All those people had a vision , a dream , and pursued it with an amazing display of hard work , stubbornness and intelligence .
They took no prisoners , and by the late eighties had pushed that new thing called , for want of a better name , Computer Science to its modern standards .
Then winter came .
Not just the AI winter .
Compare the swift pace of CS developments during the 1960 - 80 period with the subsequent advancements in the field .
We ’re using the same metaphors , the same kind of systems that we inherited from those guys and gals .
Why , we even envy the power of Lisp Machines these days .
It ’s been a long , cold winter for CS .
And the main reason was the appearance of the mentality that i’m criticising in this post , what Alan Kay aptly calls , in a recent interview , a pop culture of computers :
Perhaps it was commercialization in the 1980s that killed off the next expected new thing [ … ]
But a variety of different things conspired together , and that next generation actually did n’t show up .
One could actually argue — as I sometimes do — that the success of commercial personal computing and operating systems has actually led to a considerable retrogression in many , many respects .
You could think of it as putting a low - pass filter on some of the good ideas from the ’60s and ’ 70s , as computing spread out much , much faster than educating unsophisticated people can happen .
In the last 25 years or so , we actually got something like a pop culture , similar to what happened when television came on the scene and some of its inventors thought it would be a way of getting Shakespeare to the masses .
But they forgot that you have to be more sophisticated and have more perspective to understand Shakespeare .
What television was able to do was to capture people as they were .
So I think the lack of a real computer science today , and the lack of real software engineering today , is partly due to this pop culture .
Dead on , i say .
People advocating about making programming simpler than possible are the hallmark of this pop culture .
And when corporate and economic interests enter the picture , things get even worse .
The Lisp is sin essay goes on to say :
I frequently see on Slashdot “ Windows is designed for stupid users ” .
That is quite insulting to the millions of moms and dads , teachers and laywers and people from other walks of life who use Windows or even the Mac .
If we mandated that every new user understand Windows ’ command line syntax or Emacs , we would have failed as an industry – we would have locked out the rest of the world .
In my opinion , this totally misses the point .
There ’s nothing wrong in making computers simpler to users .
On the contrary , that ’s probably what this endeavour is all about .
Alan Kay saw it , Apple took head with its computer for the rest of us mantra .
But it does not follow that there must be a CS for the rest of us .
Making all this amazing technology possible takes effort , and needs a high level of sophistication .
Alan did n’t try to create systems usable by children inventing PHP .
He created Smalltalk striving to improve Lisp , he studied Piaget and Papert , he has degrees in maths and biology .
And he needed all that , and then more .
The ( trivial ) point i’m trying to make is that not everybody has what it takes to be a programmer .
Just as not everybody can be a singer or a painter ( as an aside , i tend to agree with the opinions that link programming and art ) .
As a matter of fact , good programmers are rare and need a quite peculiar combination of skills and talents .
Donald Knuth has put it far better than i could in the essay Theory and Practice , II ( from his Selected Papers on Computer Science ) :
The most important lesson [ after developing TeX ] , for me , was that software is hard ; and it takes a long time .
From now on I shall have significantly greater respect for every successful software tool that I encounter . [… ]
Software creation not only takes time , it ’s also much more difficult that I thought it would be .
Why is this so ?
I think the main reason is that a longer attention span is needed when working on a large computer program than when doing other intellectual tasks .
A great deal of technical information must be kept in one ’s head , all at once , in high - speed random - access memory somewhere in the brain .
We do n’t solve the painter ’s problem by complaining that perspective is hard to grasp and people should better use flat icons .
In the same way , we should n’t be claiming for a trivialisation of CS both in academia and in the industry .
The we would have failed in the industry bit in the Sriram quote above is really sad : we ’re sacrificing an admirable legacy in the name of industry and corporate profit .
The most remarkable feat of our current industry leaders is to have convinced the rest of the world that having software systems that eat incredible amounts of resources and explode without reason every now and then is part of an acceptable , even top - notch , technology .
Fortunately , other disciplines show far more respect for the people that , ultimately , is paying their wages .
If you ’ve got this far , you already have one of the qualities needed to become a programmer : stamina .
You ’ll need more .
Be prepared to study hard , to learn maths , to live in abstract worlds .
If you feel that you have “ more important things to do ” , well , that ’s all very well , but do n’t ask the rest of us to dumb down the subject so that everybody can be a programmer .
Lisp is not a sin .
The sin would be to betray the dreams , ideals and hard work of the people that have taken us this far .
We owe that to them , and to ourselves .
To end this never - ending diatribe , let me add a couple of things : first , i should apologize for taking Sriram as the scapegoat to a long honed rage : his essay contains many good points worth reading and mulling on ; second , i hope you ’re not thinking this is just an arrogant rant by an old fart : i’m not that old .

A Tiny Revolution : Let The Thinly - Sourced Rumor - Mongering Begin ! :
Would it be irresponsible to link to a Capitol Blue story simply because it bolsters my belief system , even though Capitol Blue has been egregiously wrong in the past ?
It would be irresponsible not to :
An uncivil war rages inside the walls of the West Wing of the White House , a bitter , acrimonious war driven by a failed agenda , destroyed credibility , dwindling public support and a President who lapses into Alzheimer - like periods of incoherent babbling ...
The war erupted into full - blown shout fests at Camp David this past weekend where decorum broke down in staff meetings and longtime aides threatened to quit unless Rove goes ...
White House staff members say the White House is " like a wartime bunker " where shell - shocked aides hide from those who disagree with their actions and office pools speculate on how long certain senior aides will last .
Bush , whose obscenity - laced temper tantrums increase with each new setback and scandal , abruptly ended one Camp David meeting by telling everyone in the room to " go f--- yourselves " before he stalked out of the room .
Senior aides describe Bush as increasingly " edgy " or " nervous " or " unfocused . "
They say the President goes from apparent coherent thought one moment to aimless rambles about political enemies and those who are " out to get me . "
" It 's worse than the days when Ronald Reagan 's Alzheimer 's began setting in , " one longtime GOP operative told me privately this week .
" You do n't know if he 's going to be coherent from one moment to the next .
What scares me is if he lapses into one of those fogs during a public appearance . "

Human rights abuses in Iraq are now as bad as they were under Saddam Hussein and are even in danger of eclipsing his record , according to the country 's first Prime Minister after the fall of Saddam 's regime .
' People are doing the same as [ in ] Saddam 's time and worse , ' Ayad Allawi told The Observer .
' It is an appropriate comparison .
People are remembering the days of Saddam .
These were the precise reasons that we fought Saddam and now we are seeing the same things . '
In a damning and wide - ranging indictment of Iraq 's escalating human rights catastrophe , Allawi accused fellow Shias in the government of being responsible for death squads and secret torture centres .
The brutality of elements in the new security forces rivals that of Saddam 's secret police , he said .
Allawi , who was a strong ally of the US - led coalition forces and was prime minister until this April , made his remarks as further hints emerged yesterday that President George Bush is planning to withdraw up to 40,000 US troops from the country next year , when Iraqi forces will be capable of taking over .
Allawi's bleak assessment is likely to undermine any attempt to suggest that conditions in Iraq are markedly improving .
' We are hearing about secret police , secret bunkers where people are being interrogated , ' he added .
' A lot of Iraqis are being tortured or killed in the course of interrogations .
We are even witnessing Sharia courts based on Islamic law that are trying people and executing them . '
He said that immediate action was needed to dismantle militias that continue to operate with impunity .
If nothing is done , ' the disease infecting [ the Ministry of the Interior ] will become contagious and spread to all ministries and structures of Iraq 's government ' , he said .
In a chilling warning to the West over the danger of leaving behind a disintegrating Iraq , Allawi added : ' Iraq is the centrepiece of this region .
If things go wrong , neither Europe nor the US will be safe . '
His uncompromising comments came on the eve of Saddam 's latest court appearance on charges of crimes against humanity .
They seem certain to fuel the growing sense of crisis over Iraq , both in the country itself and in the US , where political support for the occupation continues to plummet .
Allawi was selected to serve as prime minister of the first interim government , before last January 's first national elections .
Admired in both Downing Street and the White House as a non-sectarian politician committed to strong centralised government representing all Iraqis , Allawi 's supporters struggled in last January 's elections , where they were eclipsed by Shia religious parties , some of which have been implicated in the violence .
Recently , however , his reputation has enjoyed a resurgence as he has tried to build alliances with Sunni political groups ahead of next month 's national elections .
His comments come as a blow to those hoping that Iraq was moving towards normalisation under the new government .
In a speech on Wednesday , Bush is expected to hail the improved readiness of Iraqi troops , which he has identified as the key condition for withdrawing US forces .
But the proximity of the latest round of elections appears to have only intensified political murders and intimidations , including members of Allawi's own list , who have been killed and attacked by political rivals .
Despite denials of wrongdoing by the Ministry of the Interior , which has been implicated in much of the abuse , a series of damaging disclosures , including the discovery of a secret detention centre run by the ministry , has heaped embarrassment on the Iraqi government and its foreign supporters .
The intervention by one of Iraq 's most prominent political figures promises to turn human rights abuses into a key election issue .
Allawi's scathing assessment of the collapse of human rights in Iraq under the country 's first democratically elected government came amid an angry denunciation of the involvement of the Iraq government 's institutions in widespread disappearances , torture and assassinations .
He added that he now had so little faith in the rule of law that he had instructed his own bodyguards to fire on any police car that attempted to approach his headquarters without prior notice , following the implication of police units in many of the abuses .
Allawi saved his strongest condemnation for the Ministry of the Interior , whose personnel have been accused of being behind much of the abuse : ' The Ministry of the Interior is at the heart of the matter .
I am not blaming the minister [ Bayan Jabr ] himself , but the rank and file are behind the secret dungeons and some of the executions that are taking place . '
Responding to the former prime minister 's comments , Sir Menzies Campbell , the Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman , said : ' It is inconceivable in the higher reaches of the command of the multinational forces that there was not an awareness of what is being done by some Iraqis to their own countrymen .
' The assertions by Mr Allawi simply underline the catastrophic failure to have a proper strategy in place for the post - war period in Iraq . '
Nuclear devices are often tested underground to prevent radioactive material released in the explosion reaching the surface and contaminating the environment .
This method also ensures a degree of secrecy .
The release of radiation from an underground nuclear explosion - an effect known as " venting " - would give away clues to the technical composition and size of a country 's device , and therefore its nuclear capability .
STAGES OF AN UNDERGROUND NUCLEAR TEST 1 .
Preparation : a hole is drilled , the device set and then the tunnel plugged .
2 . Detonation : the device is detonated from the control room .
3 . Aftermath : the gas cools and the chamber collapses producing a crater .
BACK {current} of {total} NEXT Preparation
The test site is carefully geologically surveyed to ensure suitability .
Such tests usually take place well away from population centres .
The nuclear device is placed into a drilled hole or tunnel usually between 200 - 800 m ( 650 - 2,600 ft ) below the surface , and several metres wide .
A lead - lined canister containing monitoring equipment is lowered into the shaft above the chamber .
The hole is then plugged with gravel , sand , gypsum and other fine materials to contain the explosion and fallout underground .
The test Seismic shockwaves from the latest test were recorded in South Korea
The device is remotely detonated from a surface control bunker .
The nuclear explosion vaporises subterranean rock , creating an underground chamber filled with superheated radioactive gas .
As this cools , a pool of molten rock collects at the bottom of the chamber .
Minutes or hours later , as pressure falls , the chamber collapses in on itself causing subsidence and a crater to appear on the surface .
North Korea North Korea is believed to have tested nuclear devices in 2006 and 2009 at a site called P'unggye - yok in a remote area in the east of the country , near Kilju .
Satellite images appear to show a number of buildings and earthworks in keeping with other nuclear test sites .

Names are being bandied about for the 2007 Pirelli calendar set to be released in November .
Sophia Loren is lined up to be on the cover ( apparently ) , but her publicist insists that while the 71 year old screen legend is going to be in the calendar , she will not be appearing nude .
Actresses from Naomi Watts , to Penelope Cruz and Hilary Swank are also tipped to feature in the exclusive calendar – exclusive because it ’s only given as a corporate gift to Pirelli customers and various VIPs .
Dutch photographers Inez van Lamsweerde and Winoodh Matadin have been lined up to shoot it .
TO THE anti-globalisers , the corporation is a devilish instrument of environmental destruction , class oppression and imperial conquest .
But is it also pathologically insane ?
That is the provocative conclusion of an award - winning documentary film , called “ The Corporation ” , coming soon to a cinema near you .
People on both sides of the globalisation debate should pay attention .
Unlike much of the soggy thinking peddled by too many anti-globalisers , “ The Corporation ” is a surprisingly rational and coherent attack on capitalism 's most important institution .
It begins with a potted history of the company 's legal form in America , noting the key 19th - century legal innovation that led to treating companies as persons under law .
By bestowing on them the rights and protections that people enjoy , this legal innovation gave the company the freedom to flourish .
So if the corporation is a person , ask the film 's three Canadian co-creators , Mark Achbar , Joel Bakan and Jennifer Abbott , what sort of person is it ?
The answer , elicited over two - and - a - half hours of interviews with left - wing intellectuals , right - wing captains of industry , economists , psychologists and philosophers , is that the corporation is a psychopath .
Like all psychopaths , the firm is singularly self - interested : its purpose is to create wealth for its shareholders .
And , like all psychopaths , the firm is irresponsible , because it puts others at risk to satisfy its profit - maximising goal , harming employees and customers , and damaging the environment .
The corporation manipulates everything .
It is grandiose , always insisting that it is the best , or number one .
It has no empathy , refuses to accept responsibility for its actions and feels no remorse .
It relates to others only superficially , via make - believe versions of itself manufactured by public - relations consultants and marketing men .
In short , if the metaphor of the firm as person is a valid one , then the corporation is clinically insane .
There is a tendency among anti-globalisers to demonise captains of industry .
But according to “ The Corporation ” , the problem with companies does not lie with the people who run them .
Sir Mark Moody - Stuart , a former boss of Shell , comes across in the film as a sympathetic and human character .
At one point , he and his wife greet protesters camped on the front lawn of their English cottage with offers of a cup of tea and apologies for the lack of soya milk for the vegans among them .
The film gives Sam Gibara , boss of Goodyear , time to air his opinions , which are given a reasonably neutral edit .
Ray Anderson , boss of Interface ( which claims , with psychopathic grandiosity , to be the world 's largest commercial carpetmaker ) is given the hero treatment .
Having experienced an “ epiphany ” about the destructive and unsustainable nature of modern capitalism , Mr Anderson has donned the preacher 's cloth to spread the religion of environmental sustainability among his peers .
The main message of the film is that , through their psychopathic pursuit of profit , firms make good people do bad things .
Lucy Hughes of Initiative Media , an advertising consultancy , is shown musing about the ethics of designing marketing strategies that exploit the tendency of children to nag parents to buy things , before comforting herself with the thought that she is merely performing her proper role in society .
Mark Barry , a “ competitive intelligence professional ” , disguises himself as a headhunter to extract information for his corporate clients from rivals , while telling the camera that he would never behave so deceitfully in his private life .
Human values and morality survive the onslaught of corporate pathology only via a carefully cultivated schizophrenia : the tobacco boss goes home , hugs his kids and feels a little less bad about spreading cancer .
Company executives and foot soldiers alike will identify instantly with this analysis , because it is accurate .
But it is also incomplete .
The greater insanity
Although the moviemakers claim ownership of the company - as - psychopath idea , it predates them by a century , and rightfully belongs , in its full form , to Max Weber , the German sociologist .
For Weber , the key form of social organisation defining the modern age was bureaucracy .
Bureaucracies have flourished because their efficient and rational division and application of labour is powerful .
But a cost attends this power .
As cogs in a larger , purposeful machine , people become alienated from the traditional morals that guide human relationships as they pursue the goal of the collective organisation .
There is , in Weber 's famous phrase , a “ parcelling - out of the soul ” .
For Weber , the greater potential tyranny lay not with the economic bureaucracies of capitalism , but the state bureaucracies of socialism .
The psychopathic national socialism of Nazi Germany , communism of Stalinist Soviet rule and fascism of imperial Japan ( whose oppressive bureaucratic machinery has survived well into the modern era ) surely bear Weber out .
Infinitely more powerful than firms and far less accountable for its actions , the modern state has the capacity to behave even in evolved western democracies as a more dangerous psychopath than any corporation can ever hope to become : witness the environmental destruction wreaked by Japan 's construction ministry .
The makers of “ The Corporation ” counter that the state was not the subject of their film .
Fair point .
But they have done more than produce a thought - provoking account of the firm .
Their film also invites its audience to weigh up the benefits of privatisation versus public ownership .
It dwells on the familiar problem of the corporate corruption of politics and regulatory agencies that weakens public oversight of privately owned firms charged with delivering public goods .
But that is only half the story .
The film has nothing to say about the immense damage that can also flow from state ownership .
Instead , there is a misty - eyed alignment of the state with the public interest .
Run that one past the people of , say , North Korea .
Valentine 's Day Security
Last Friday , the Wall Street Journal ran an article ( unfortunately , the link is only for paid subscribers ) about how Valentine ’s Day is the day when cheating spouses are most likely to trip up :
Valentine ’s
Day is the biggest single 24 - hour period for florists , a huge event for greeting - card companies and a boon for candy makers .
But it ’s also a major crisis day for anyone who is having an affair .
After all , Valentine ’s Day is the one holiday when everyone is expected to do something romantic for their spouse or lover — and if someone has both , it ’s a serious problem .
So , of course , private detectives work overtime .
“ If anything is going on , it will be happening on that day , ” says Irene Smith , who says business at her Discreet Investigations detective agency in Golden , Colo . , as much as doubles — to as many as 12 cases some years — on Valentine ’s Day .
Private detectives are expensive — about $ 100 per hour , according to the article — and might not be worth it .
The article suggests some surveillance tools you can buy at home : a real - time GPS tracking system you can hide in your spouse ’s car , a Home Evidence Collection Kit you can use to analyze stains on “ clothing , car seats or elsewhere , ” Internet spying software , a telephone recorder , and a really cool buttonhole camera .
But even that stuff may be overkill :
Ruth Houston , author of a book called Is He Cheating on You ? — 829 Telltale Signs , says she generally recommends against spending money on private detectives to catch cheaters because the indications are so easy to read .
( Sign No. 3 under “ Gifts ” : He tries to convince you he bought expensive chocolates for himself . )
I hope I do n’t need to remind you that cheaters should also be reading that book , familiarizing themselves with the 829 telltale signs they should avoid making .
The article has several interesting personal stories , and warns that “ planning a ‘ business trip ’ that falls over Valentine ’s Day is a typical mistake cheaters make . ”
So now I ’m wondering why the RSA Conference is being held over Valentine ’s Day .
EDITED TO ADD ( 2/14 ) : Today ’s Washington Post has a similar story .

How to be depressed
October 10 , 2004
Evolution has given human beings an amazing intellectual faculty coupled with an incredible ability to adapt to any environment .
These talents allow us to make the best of perilous situations , to turn adversity into triumph and to survive even when all the odds suggest otherwise .
But the magic does n't stop there .
These very same talents can be converted into a weapon against ourselves , allowing us to transform any situation into a reason to feel like crap , to put ourselves down , and to drink deeply from the bitter well of despair .
The trick is to apply negative transformations to all of your experiences , and to apply these negative transformations so often that they become automatic .
This way madness lies ...
Let 's look at self - destructive thoughts in detail .
Here are some particular thought - patterns that have had brilliant results in helping millions of people feel worthless , since time immemorial :
Everything is pass / fail I can read minds !
I can read the future , and see the whole world !
Let 's apply a label !
If I feel bad , I am bad I should do this , I should do that !
I 'm responsible for everything Bad things are worth extra points
Good things are worth less points
Good things are actually bad things
These thought patterns are classic cases of " cognitive distortions " and I 've based them on the work of two doctors , David D. Burns and Aaron T. Beck .
You can read an excellent book by David D. Burns called ' Feeling Good ' , but it may actually stop you from being depressed .
It will probably even have long - term benefits .
Burns and Beck were remarkable doctors who directly helped thousands of people to overcome depression , and through their pioneering work on ' Cognitive Therapy ' they saved millions of people from depression .
Now on the surface you may think it sounds like Burns and Beck were good people .
And you may be a little cheered up to think that such good exists in this world .
But no .
I intend to teach you about depression .
And we 're going to start our depressing lessons by applying the most depressing rule of all , rule number 10 : Good things are actually bad things .
So let 's use this fabulous ' reverse alchemy ' to turn Burns and Beck from heroes into villains .
While their work appears to have had a net positive gain for all of humanity , we happen to live in a complicated universe where every act has both good and bad consequences .
By curing people of depression without using traditional anti-depressants , the ' good '
Doctors must have caused some measurable financial short falls within pharmaceutical companies .
This would in turn have caused some employees to either lose their jobs or have their pay reduced .
And this must have caused financial hardship for the former employees and their families .
It 's possible that some of these unemployed workers felt despondent and started to drink more alcohol than they had previously .
And this may have caused them to beat their wives , who may have ended up depressed themselves , and even turned to harder drugs , such as heroin , in a futile attempt to cope with their violent home life .
In a short time , a heroin dependency may have led to homelessness and a life of prostitution and petty crime .
So before we go patting Doctors Burns and Beck on the back , let 's remember that they were fundamentally wife - beating alcoholic junky - pimp criminals who left a trail of misery and despair in their wake !
Thank you rule number 10 !
This ' reverse alchemy ' stuff is really very simple .
But rule 10 is the ultimate , and the trickiest cognitive distortion of all .
Let 's go back and look at some of the simpler techniques for feeling blue .
1. Everything is pass / fail .
While writing this article I think to myself :
Hmmm , I hope that a few people read it and enjoy it .
Hmmm , I hope that a few people read it and enjoy it .
But no , that is n't quite a pass / fail statement , so let me revise it a little :
Unless five hundred people read this article , I have failed .
Unless thirty people leave comments , I have failed .
Unless it is linked to by forty other blogs , I have failed .
Unless it is still being linked to by other blogs in six months ' time , I have failed .
Unless it is so brilliant that I am spontaneously contacted by Penguin publishing , who beg me to convert the article into a short and satirical self - help book that goes on to sell six million copies , then I have failed .
And failed bitterly .
I really suck .
I do .

I really suck .
I do .
Like all ten distortions , this pass / fail attitude serves only to help you become depressed .
It has no positive side - effects whatsoever .
So go ahead and incorporate it into your life : I guarantee you will feel sorry !
2. I can read minds .
Yesterday I was talking to a friend on the telephone whom I had n't spoken to in a while .
I do n't really know what he 's been up to or what he 's thinking , but if I intend to be depressed I should have a stab at reading his thoughts .
So here goes !
He must be thinking :
Why is this idiot calling me all of a sudden ?
What does he want ?
He was annoying last time I spoke to him !
He thinks his jokes are so damn funny !
He 's just a jerk !
I 've got better things to do than talk to him .
I do n't really need to waste my time with this loser !

He thinks his jokes are so damn funny !
He 's just a jerk !
I 've got better things to do than talk to him .
I do n't really need to waste my time with this loser !
It 's a good thing that the power of depression allows me to read minds .
Because if I was to instead evaluate the conversation at face value , I would probably notice a lot of undepressing thoughts that I was thinking such as :
He sure sounded happy to hear from me , and though I felt a little anxious , it was very easy to talk to him .
No wonder we 've been good friends for years .
He sure sounded happy to hear from me , and though I felt a little anxious , it was very easy to talk to him .
No wonder we 've been good friends for years .
3 . I can read the future and see the whole world .
The mathematical theory of chaos , and the phenomenon of ' sensitive dependence on initial conditions ' demonstrate how truly impossible it is to read the future .
But do n't let hard science or common - sense stand in the way of predictions of catastrophe , doom and horror .
For example , when you have a few moments of despair you must quickly extrapolate them into a lifetime of agony .
If you feel down for ten minutes , learn to automatically tell yourself :
Well , that 's it for me .
I 'll be depressed forever now .
Everything is hopeless .
The fog will never lift .
Well , that 's it for me .
I 'll be depressed forever now .
Everything is hopeless .
The fog will never lift .
If one person does one negative thing to you , translate this into a lifetime of persecution in a cruel world of terror and hatred .
For example , if the bus driver seems gruff when he hands you change for your bus ticket , say to yourself :
Typical .
He can see I 'm a bad person .
In a world of bad people .
No one likes helping anyone .
This world is filled with hate .
Typical .
He can see I 'm a bad person .
In a world of bad people .
No one likes helping anyone .
This world is filled with hate .
4 . Let 's apply a label !
Labels can stop common - sense in its tracks !
They 're perhaps the most powerful tool in our depression - pack , and oh - so versatile .
We can apply them to people around us , and for added sadness we can apply them to ourselves as well !
When I kick my toe against a chair I can label myself a " clumsy fool " .
Of course , by doing this I am ignoring the millions of time I have failed to kick my toe against a chair .
I am selecting that one slip up , giving it special treatment and using it to transform my entire image of my self .
It 's unfair , but it 's good at making me sad .
When someone cuts me off in traffic , I can label them an " utter prick " .
Never mind that I know nothing else about them .
That they probably do n't spend all of their waking lives cutting people off in traffic .
If I succeed in labelling them a prick , then I 've proven my ability to apply pass / fail principles to the things around me , and you just wait and see how easy it will be for me to feel frustrated and upset with life itself !
My desk is messy -- therefore I 'm a messy person .
There 's a speck of dirt on the floor .
Therefore the house is a pigsty and I 'm crap at housework .
5 . If I feel bad , I am bad !
This is also known as emotional reasoning and relies on the sort of logical flaw that Lewis Carrol packed into ' Alice in Wonderland ' .
A classic emotional statement is " I feel guilty therefore I am guilty . "
Keep following that line of thought and you 'll invent something to feel guilty about .
6. I " should " do this , I " should " do that !
Not feeling exhausted and despondent ?
You really should !
Turn up the pressure !
Aim too high !
You 'll soon be surrounded by a sticky fog of inadequacy .
Consider using this popular phrase , as a powerful depressant :
But I should be happy the entire time .
But Ibe happy thetime .
Here 's a great ' should ' statement that could make even the most successful people feel like they 've achieved nothing :
By age thirty , Alexander the Great had taken control of the entire world .
What have I done ?
Nothing !
I should 've achieved something great by now .
By age thirty , Alexander the Great had taken control of the entire world .
What have I done ?
Nothing !
I should 've achieved something great by now .
These unfair comparisons are a never ending source of sad .
Try combining a lot of them together .
For example :
I wish I had the intelligence of Einstein , the spirituality of Gandhi , the leadership skills of Nelson Mandela , the strength of Arnold Schwarzenagger , the comedic skills of Woody Allen , the artistic talent of Michelangelo , the creativity of Leonardo DaVinci , the funk - power of James Brown , the sex appeal of Danny Devito ...

You can use this string of improbable desires to build into one truly impossible desire !
Get Down !
7 . I 'm responsible for everything
Imagine that two friends of yours just got a divorce .
In case it never occurred to you , let me tell you now : that 's actually your fault .
Okay , common sense might tell you that they are adults , in control of their own lives .
At best you 've got no more than a very tiny ability to influence them at all .
But according to rule number 7 , you are responsible for everything .
Everything bad , anyway .
You forced them apart .
You let them down .
If you had only been there a little more often , if you 'd only said the right thing at the right time , then they'd have made it through .
It 's your fault !
And yours alone !
8 . Bad things are worth extra points
Imagine you are playing a game of football against a fairly strong team .
You 're playing hard , and fairly well matched , but there is one little difference .
Every time they score against you , you do n't give them just one point .
You give them ten points .
Or a hundred points .
Or a thousand points .
Try defeating that team , loser !
And so it is , if you want your bad thoughts to defeat you .
Every bad thing that happens can be multiplied by a factor of at least one thousand .
It 's possible effects on your life are very high indeed .
The universe has some innate way of knowing which incidents are bad , and can guarantee that they will occur again and again and again .
In fact , it 's only the bad things that are real .
If you want to , you can dwell on the negative events .
Replay them in your mind over and over .
And conversely ...
9 . Good things are worth less points
Good things must be attenuated down until they are almost non-existent .
Okay , someone said something nice about you .
Quickly respond with ' it was nothing really ' , or ' never mind , that 's okay ' .
Tell yourself ' they 're just saying that . '
Do n't give yourself a pat on the back for a job well done .
Crush the positive .
Cherish the negative .
10 .
Good things are actually bad things
And yes , the strongest alchemy of all is the ability to turn the positive right around and make it negative .
It 's a simple trick and anyone can master it .
Your friend won a million dollars ?
That 's bad , because now they wo n't need you anymore .
And you feel jealous about it , which proves you are a bad person .
What 's good is bad and what 's bad is bad .
Maybe you 've already got some naturally ability at the above things without me telling you how .
If so , I am impressed !
But do n't get too smug , fathead .
When you 've succeeded at becoming depressed , do n't think that your work is done .
If you stop thinking distorted negative thoughts , your depression could lift quite suddenly .
If you seek help , you could be surprised to find that modern therapy has startling capabilities of reducing and overcoming depression .
Remember to keep telling yourself : " I am that one rare individual who is beyond help . "
This statement , though obviously ludicrous when written down or said out loud , can be very easy to believe if you just let it rattle around inside your brain for long enough .
Regular exercise , such as a little walk in the morning , can help clear your mind of negative thoughts .
So stay inside and mope by all means .
Do n't even get out of bed .
By recognising the negative things you tell yourself , and particularly by writing them down , you can learn to control them or even stop them .
Be warned : this alone may trigger an immediate and lasting easing of your depression .
But if you encourage negative distortions , if you let them continue and if you do nothing to stop them , these negative thoughts will almost definitely succeed in ruling your every action .
Such is the self - fulfilling power of negativity .
By applying the principles outlined above , you can look forward to a long life of sadness and despair .
Best of luck !

The feeling of overcoming it , however , is damn sweet .
If you tend to feel blue at times , please take some little steps to help yourself .
I guarantee you that it 's worth it .
That you are worth it .
If you can't see that right now , that 's cool .
