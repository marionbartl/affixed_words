Music producer Phil Spector was found guilty Monday of second - degree murder in the February 2003 shooting death of actress Lana Clarkson .
Jurors also found Spector personally used the firearm while committing the crime at his Alhambra mansion .
Sentencing has been set for May 29 .
Second - degree murder carries a penalty of 15 years to life in prison .
The firearm enhancement adds three , four or 10 years in prison , according to the district attorney 's office .
The judge denied bail and Spector , wearing a fire - engine red tie and pocket square , was taken into custody after the verdict was announced .
He also wore a " Barack Obama Rocks " button on his left suit lapel .
Spector and his wife entered the courtroom at about 2 p.m. , and the verdict was read at about 15 minutes later .
His son and daughter were seated next to him at the counsel 's table .
Spector 's wife , Rachelle , cried as the decision was announced .
Spector showed no reaction as his attorney rubbed his client 's left shoulder .
Members of the Clarkson family , including her mother and sister , also were in the courtroom .
" This is why we do this job , " said prosecutor Alan Jackson .
" If there 's a wrong , we can attempt to try to right it .
Today is when the Clarkson family gets their justice . "
As of Monday morning , the jury had spent about 30 hours discussing the case over eight days since March 26 .
Spector , 69 , was charged with murder in the Feb.
3 , 2003 , shooting death of the 40 - year - old actress and House of Blues VIP hostess at his mansion in Alhambra .
He claims she shot herself with his gun .
" We thought the case was about what the scientific and physical evidence showed , " said Spector 's attorney , Doron Weinberg .
" We thought it showed he did not commit the crime .
We thought that should have been sufficient . "
Weinberg said he believed the case was swayed by the judge 's erroneous rulings , particularly one that allowed five women from Spector 's past to testify .
He said it would be the basis for appeal and a request for a new trial .
Still , he added that Spector took the verdict " very stoically .
He wanted to know what is next . "
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler told jurors that they could consider convicting Spector of involuntary manslaughter instead of second - degree murder .
The option of involuntary manslaughter was not given in Spector 's first trial .
That jury deadlocked 10 - 2 on the second - degree murder charge in September 2007 , with the majority voting in favor of convicting him .
" This entire jury took this so seriously , " the forewoman said in an interview room after the verdict was read .
" I do n't think there could have been another set of people who would listen to everything , review everything .
It is a painful decision .
Until somebody is in our shoes , you have no idea .
It 's tough to be on a jury .
You 're talking about another human being .
We all have people we love .
You try to evaluate another human being and it's difficult . "
She said there was not a single piece of evidence that convinced the jury of Spector 's guilt .
" Everybody was completely neutral , " she said , until they went through the evidence " piece , by piece , by piece . "
Spector , renowned in music circles for the " Wall of Sound " technique he invented in the 1960s and used in his work with the Beatles and other groups , had been free on $ 1 million bail posted shortly after his arrest .
Clarkson , who was best known for her starring role in the 1985 Roger Corman cult hit " Barbarian Queen , " had bit parts on dozens of television shows and in a few well - known movies , such as 1982's " Fast Times at Ridgemont High . "
Case Timeline
Spector had long lived in seclusion at his suburban Alhambra " castle . "
He was out on the town in Hollywood when he met Clarkson on Feb. 3 , 2003 , at the House of Blues .
The tall , blond actress , recently turned 40 and unable to find acting work , had taken a job as a hostess .
When the club closed in the wee hours , she accepted a chauffeured ride to Spector 's home for a drink .
Three hours later , she was dead .
Spector 's chauffeur , the key witness , said he heard a gunshot , then saw Spector emerge holding a gun and heard him say : " I think I killed somebody . "
Defense attorney Doron Weinberg disputed whether the chauffeur remembered the words accurately .
In closing arguments , Weinberg listed 14 points of forensic evidence including blood spatter , gunshot residue and DNA , which he said were proof of a self - inflicted wound .
" It 's very difficult to put a gun in somebody 's mouth , " he said .
" Every single fact says this is a self - inflicted gunshot wound , " Weinberg argued .
" How do you ignore it ?
How do you say this could have been a homicide ? "
But prosecutors portrayed Spector as a dangerous man who became a " demonic maniac " when he drank and had a history of threatening women with guns .
They also contended blood spatter evidence proved that Clarkson could not have shot herself .
As in the first trial , they presented testimony from five women who told of being threatened by a drunken Spector , even held hostage in his home , with a gun pointed at them and threats of death if they tried to leave .
The parallels with the night Clarkson died were chilling even if the stories were very old -- 31 years in one instance .
Clarkson 's mother and sister sat through both trials and Spector 's young wife sat across the courtroom from them .
Hazel Blears , the gutsy Communities Secretary , supports a tough approach .
But she is being undermined repeatedly by the Muslim advisers who surround her and who have a major stake in ensuring the new strategy goes in a different direction .
Let us be clear : Contest 2 is about ensuring Britain 's security , uprooting terrorism and creating a proud , pluralist nation at home with liberal , secular democracy .
It is about shifting the current lethargic thinking that surrounds Islamist extremism .
It is not about appeasing activist Muslim men who lobby for Hamas .
The Contest 2 White Paper must be more courageous than what we have seen from this Government to date .
It should disregard the findings of focus groups , the self - serving advice of " community experts " , and name the monster that we face : Islamist extremism .

In 2000 , legislation to restore the Everglades created a partnership between the US federal government and the state of Florida to undertake the largest environmental project in US history called the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan ( CERP ) .
Â
Under this agreement , saving the Everglades would take 30 years , and the burden of cost ( estimated at $ 10 billion ) would be split equally between the partners .
Â
Unfortunately , the federal government has not been forthcoming with the funding for restoration until now .
Image by stig nygaard
In 2000 , Congress allocated $ 1.4 billion in federal funds as a down payment on the Everglades restoration project .
Â
Under the Bush administration , funding was not forthcoming .
Â
In fact , Bush vetoed a $ 21 billion federal water preservation bill which included almost $ 2 billion for Everglades restoration .
Â Furthermore , Bush ’s U.S. Department of the Interior pressured the United Nations ’ World Heritage Committee to remove the Everglades from the endangered list .
Fortunately for the “ River of Grass ” , the Obama administration has not forgotten the Everglades .
Â $ 96 million of the $ 4.6 billion federal stimulus package earmarked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers civil works projects will go towards Everglades restoration .
Â Additional funding of $ 183 million will come from the Congressional spending bill that passed last month .
Â
Specifically , the money will be used for :
Construction of a reservoir to improve the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge
Restoration of 55,000 acres of the Picayune Strand wetlands in Southwest Florida
Upgrading of the Tamiami Trail
Restoration of the Kissimmee River
Restoration the Big Cypress National Preserve
Removal of invasive plants
Repairs on Lake Okeechobee ’s dike
Various pilot projects and studies
Environmentalists are applauding Obama for funding Everglades restoration , as the Palm Beach Post explains :
The Everglades ’ stimulus money is a tiny fraction of the billions of dollars that Congress promised in 2000 – and so far , has failed to provide – for its half of a $ 10.9 billion state - federal restoration plan .
Still , Everglades advocates cheered .
After eight years of stalling by the Bush administration , the Everglades may finally be on the restoration path again . Â
Thus far , the state of Florida has outspent the federal government six to one on Everglades restoration .
Â
The $ 279 million dedicated by Obama for CERP marks the single - largest amount that Congress and the White House have allocated since the project was created in 2000 .
In the aftermath of the Pirate Bay verdict the controversy surrounding judge Tomas Norström grows bigger and bigger .
Most recently , defense lawyer Per E Samuelsson sent a letter to the Appeal Court in which he explains that the younger generation has lost faith in the legal system because of the shady selection procedure .
Unlike other criminal trials in Sweden , the judge in the Pirate Bay trial was n’t selected at random .
Instead , he was chosen because of his expertise with copyright related issues .
Indeed , as a member of various pro-copyright organizations , Norström is very involved in the issue .
However , the ties to these lobby groups might also cloud his judgment and thus the verdict , some claim .
It is therefore highly dubious that Norström was handpicked and not randomly assigned as is normal procedure in cases like this .
Defense lawyer Per E Samuelsson has now sent a letter to the Court of Appeal where he addresses the issue and seems to confirm earlier rumors he shared with the press .
“ The young generation ’s trust in the judicial system is at stake here , ” he told the Swedish news agency ( TT ) in a comment .
“ I do n’t want to say that the randomness of judge selection has been fixed , but the case has been handed to Norström mainly because he is considered an expert on copyright .
That raises questions since this is a criminal case .
A large majority of the young generation believes that what is going on here is a farce , ” Samuelsson added .
Tomas Norström at his best
According to Samuelsson , there is no doubt that all the suspicious connections to pro-copyright groups indicate that Norström had preconceived ideas on the issues addressed during the Pirate Bay trial .
“ I have a hard time to let go of the thought that he kept quiet about this because he had the intention of using his opinions in the case .
I do n’t hesitate for a moment when saying that this is bias , ” he said .
Henrik Pontén , lawyer at the anti-piracy bureau did n’t want to comment on Samuelsson ’s letter to the Appeal Court , and said he will await the court ’s decision due to be announced a few weeks from now .
The Pirate Bay ’s Peter Sunde told TorrentFreak that the current developments amount to yet another plot twist in the tragicomedy that their trial has turned into .
“ We will win in the end , ” he said , promising a happy ending .
Not to be outdone by David Letterman 's EV love - fest , Jay Leno has posted his review of the Aptera 2e to JayLenosGarage.com .
Clearly , now is the time for all late night hosts to come to the aid of electric cars .
Next up : Jon Stewart invites Sarah Vowell to help him take on the RORMaxx Formula AE .
( We hope . )
In the clip , Leno and Aptera 's low - key front man , Greg Wilbur , discuss the finer points of the 2e - - notably , its look .
Leno seems pretty well smitten on that front , saying that it's " an exciting looking automobile " .
Also exciting ( at least for the folks at Aptera ) : someone with the star status and car cred of Jay Leno endorsing such an outside - the - box vehicle .
Of course , as funky looking as the 2e is , no review would be complete without putting it through its paces , and Leno does just that .
Hurtling down the freeway , he praises its " George Jetson feel " and insists that it 's fun to drive .
The three - wheeled Aptera 's only shortcoming ?
Dodging road hazards : " If you see a pothole in the road , you 're gonna hit it with something . "
There are two other great moments in the clip -- the first being Leno 's market analysis .
He bemoans the high cost of EVs like the Tesla Roadster and says that " if they can bring [ the Aptera 2e ] in for under forty [ thousand ] , I think it 'll be , uh , ... very , very exciting . "
It 's the " uh " that kills us -- as in , " it 'll be , uh ... very exciting ... for the people who buy one , but I will not be in that number . "
The second moment : when Leno half - jokingly encourages Aptera owners to save all the money they would 've spent on gas and buy a private jet .
Which would be possible , perhaps , but is n't part of the point of the 2e to cut down on air pollution -- you know , like the air pollution caused by jet planes ?
Fifteen minutes in the air , and hell , you might as well buy a Hummer .
( Assuming Hummer 's still around , of course . )

Just a few days ago , we pointed out that ASCAP is arguing in federal court that every time your musical ringtone rings in public , you 're violating copyright law by " publicly performing " it without a license .
Now ASCAP has fired up its spin control machinery and issued a statement to Billboard , including this talking point , doubtless meant to be reassuring :
To be completely clear , ASCAP ’s approach has always been to license these businesses – not to charge listeners / end-users .
This is an archetypal example of copyright doublespeak .
What ASCAP should be saying is : " It 's not infringing when your ringtone goes off in public . "
That 's because the Copyright Act specifically provides in Section 110 ( 4 ) that public performances " without any purpose of direct or indirect commercial advantage " are " not infringements of copyright . "
Instead , ASCAP 's statement essentially amounts to " you 're all pirates , but do n't fret , we 'd never sue you for it , just every company that provides you with services . "
We 've seen similar statements from others in the copyright industries : the RIAA , for example , still has never admitted that ripping a CD you own for use on your own iPod is a noninfringing fair use .
Instead , they say " we have no objection to that " or " we 'd never sue you for that . "
Statements like this provide no certainty to consumers , nor to the innovators who are trying to build businesses ( whether delivering VCRs , ringtones or iPods ) helping consumers enjoy copyrighted works in every conceivable way that does not infringe the limited rights granted to copyright owners .
So , reporters , next time you get this copyright doublespeak from an ASCAP representative , remember to ask the next question : " If I have a musical ringtone , and it rings in a public place , are you saying that I 've infringed the copyrights of your members ? "

We havenâ€™t reached a point where corporations own swathes of cultivated fields that produce a semi-annual crop worth billions of dollars .
A crop that can be taxed by the government on tobacco rates ( 18 - 24 % ) , that could create spin - off industries , and can be grown in two separate methods , one for recreational / medicinal use , and the other as industrial .
George Washington and Thomas Jefferson grew hemp , so if the founding fathers found it okay , whatâ€™s our problem ?
We are talking about pot , and the topic at hand is the legalization of the drug for taxation purposes .
Leave it to good old Uncle Sam to find away to collect more taxes .
A cynic would say that if youâ€ ™re going to tax one drug , tax them all .
And there are very powerful arguments for decriminalization of almost all drugs .
There would be lower costs in imprisoning people , and higher taxes going into the government coffer .
There would also be methods to control the content of the drugs , creating cottage industries .
But letâ€™s table that for a moment .
To the first time smoker , tobacco has almost the same effect as marijuana .
Many closet cigarette smokers only do so when drinking because it â€œhelpsâ€ the buzz .
Cigarette smoking is an accepted industry because of its history , but also because the marketing machine that is the Tobacco Industry worked very hard in the 40â€™s and 50 â€™s to criminalize marijuana .
If you havenâ€™t seen the film , REEFER MADNESS , youâ€ ™re missing out on one of the best propaganda promotions in history .
Powerful tobacco lobbies criminalized pot , and Americans went along with it .
The problem may be education .
The voting public today grew up under the â€œJust Say No.â€ policy .
Again , great marketing campaigns turned the mind of the population .
Who can forget â€ œThis is your brain on drugs.â€ 
Itâ€™s a powerful message and no one wants scrambled brains for breakfast .
Psychologists and sociologists shout that pot is a gateway drug that will lead to higher tendencies to move to harder drugs .
They also publish reports that state people who smoke cigarettes have a tendency to move to harder drugs , but no one is screaming that tobacco is a gateway drug .
Maybe they should .
The anti-marijuana crowd is great with statistics that tell you how bad pot is and what it costs society .
Trot those numbers next to alcohol related incidents and you find a difference of almost unbelievable proportions .
There are 181,000 pot related traffic accidents each year .
There are 1,810,000 alcohol related traffic accidents each year .
Yet alcohol is legal .
With the country in the economic turmoil itâ€™s facing now , maybe pot is the answer .
Alcohol was demonized during Prohibition by a group of conservative hard liners who blamed all of societyâ€™s problems on it .
Sure , why blame yourself or weak character when a scapegoat is so easily found .
So hooch went underground and ushered in an era of gangsters , bootleggers and a bigger government to fight the war on booze .
( It also led to the creation of NASCAR . )
Prohibition put the elements in place that led to a decline in societal values , instead of improving them , as the prohibitionist would have you hope .
Marijuana faces these same camps .
On one side you have the anti-drug crowd who blame pot for everything from Al - Queda to overactive teenage sexuality .
On the other side you have the pro-pot supporters talking about the benefits of the drug , such as pain management and mood enhancement .
Then there are those of us in the middle who recognize that pot is the exact same category as cigarettes and alcohol , and that those two drugs kill more people than pot ever has .
We in the middle hope pot is legalized , regulated and taxed .
Not only would it be a big boost in the economic arm of America , but much needed public funds for education and emergency services could be created .
As more and more government entities are shuttering their doors due to lack of money , maybe pot is the answer to turning our tax kettleâ€™s black .
So how would we play pot if it gets legalized ?
Follow the tobacco companies that will plant thousands of acres of the quick growing cash crop , and the mid-level retail giants that will add the shops to their folds .
You wonâ€™t find the stores in the mall , but maybe strip malls .
Internet trade will boom , so bet on any tech platforms that can support it .
If Yahoo or another portal gets a jumpstart on the market they can dominate it .
EBay would be a definite consideration as the auction site would explode with â€ œHow toâ€ and Home grown manuals .
If pot is legalized , you could turn a great play on your portfolio and as America rakes in tax dollars , you could rake in profits .
Sometimes just when you think the industry can't get any weirder ... it does .
Take , for instance , two news items that crossed our desk in sequence today .
First , Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal area reporting French carmaker Renault and its partner Nissan have apparently joined former race driver and current car dealer Roger Penske in bidding for the network of about 400 Saturn dealers that General Motors will sell or close by the end of the year .
Second , at its annual shareholder meeting in Paris this morning , Renault unveiled a close - to - production model of its small electric delivery van , called the Kangoo be bop Z.E. ( Yes , really . )
So we got to wondering .
We already know that GM will hang onto the Plug - In Two - Mode Hybrid technology that was previously going to be launched in a version of the Saturn Vue Two - Mode Hybrid , itself now canceled .
If Saturn survives , then , it will need some kind of " green " image vehicle to replace the slow - selling 2009 Saturn Aura Hybrid and 2009 Saturn Vue Hybrid ( nee Green Line ) .
How does Saturn Kangoo Be Bop sound to YOU , then ?
Hmmmm .
Yeah .
We thought so too .
Two thirds of teenagers do n't believe in God
Teenagers even say family , friends , money , music and even reality television are more important than religion .
It also emerged six out of ten 10 children ( 59 per cent ) believe that religion " has a negative influence on the world " .
The survey also shows that half of teenagers have never prayed and 16 per cent have never been to church .
The study of 1,000 teenagers aged 13 to 18 was carried out by Penguin to mark this week 's publication of controversial novel ' Killing God ' by Kevin Brooks .
The book is about a 15 - year - old girl who questions the existence of God.
Kevin Brooks , the author , said : " I ca n't say I am surprised by the teenagers ' responses .
" Part of the reason that I wrote Killing God was that I wanted to explore the personal attitudes of young people today , especially those with troubled lives , towards organised religion and the traditional concept of God .
" How can the moralities of an ancient religion relate to the tragedies and disorders of today 's broken world ?
And why do some people turn to God for help while others take comfort in drugs and alcohol ?
" These are just some of the questions I wanted to consider ...
And I was n't looking for answers .
"
The research also found 55 per cent of young people are not bothered about religion and 60 per cent only go to church for a wedding or christening .
Only three out of 10 teenagers believe in an afterlife and 41 per cent believe that nothing happens to your body when you die , but one in 10 reckon they come back as an animal or another human being .
A Church of England spokesman said : " Many teenagers are n't sure what they believe at that stage of their lives , as is clear from the number who said they do n't know whether they believe in God .
"
On the other hand many of these results point to the great spirituality of young people today that the Church is seeking to respond to through new forms of worship alongside tradition ones .
" Hanne Stinson , chief executive of The British Humanist Association , said : " It confirms that young people - like adults - do not need a religion to have positive values .
" The ' golden rule ' , which is often claimed by religions as a religious value , is in reality a shared human value - shared by all the major religions and the non-religious and almost every culture - that predates all the major world religions . "
GOT overwrite ?
" GOT overwrite " という、( ここでは特 にLinux の ) プログラムに対する攻撃方法があります。攻撃が成功すると、そのプロセスの権限での任意コード実行等、深刻な被害を受けます。最近のGNU ld(リンカ )のオプションを用いると、この攻撃から身を守ることができるそうですので、紹介します。
最初にまとめ （こまかいことはあとで ）
GOT overwrite から身を守るには、gccでプログラムをリンクするときに、
- Wl , -z , now , -z , relro をつけるだけです。起動時間が遅くなるというトレードオフがありますが、GOTがreadonlyになります。GOTがreadonlyなら、GOT
overwrite attack を受けたときに、プロセス がSEGV してくれますので、安全性が高まります。プロセスのメモリマップを確認すると、きちんと
w が落ちています。 % gcc - Wl , -z , now , -z , relro foo .c % readelf - S a.out | grep .got [ 20 ] .got PROGBITS 08049fd8 000fd8 000028 04 WA 0 0 4 % ./a.out & [ 32304 ] % cat / proc/32304 / maps | grep 08049 08049000-0804a000 r--p 00000000 08:02 6391415 /home/yupo/tmp/a.out ( ^ 普通のバイナリと違っ てGOTにw ( =書き込み許可 ) が無い ) GOT は libhoge .
so も個々に持っていますので、それら共有ライブラリを作成する際にも同じオプションを使うと良いでしょう*1。最近のglibcは最初から

PLT / GOT 経由の関数呼び
ここからstep - by - stepの解説です。なにげに( Web上には ) あまり解説がないので ...目新しい話ではないですが&間違いがあったらゴメンナサイですが、一応。興味がなければ、「 GOT overwrite attack の実験 」までスキップしてください 。
GOT というのは、ごく単純に書くと、 「 別の共有ライブラリ中の関数( 例えばlibc.soの中のputs関数)を呼ぶときに参照する間接ジャンプテーブル」です。詳しくは
Linkers & Loaders などを参照してください。
例えば、次のようなコードを書いたとして % cat hell o2.c # include < stdio.h > int main ( ) { puts ( " hello
" ) ; return 0 ; } % gcc - Wall -o hell o2 hell o2. c main関数周辺を逆アセンブルしてみると、次のようになります。 % objdump -d hell o2 | grep - A 10 '< main > :' 08048384 < main > : 8048384 : 8d 4c 24 04 lea 0x4( %esp ) , %ecx 8048388 : 83 e4 f0 and $ 0 xfffffff0 , %esp 804838b : ff 71 fc pushl 0xfffffffc( %ecx ) 804838e : 55 push %ebp 804838f : 89 e5 mov %esp , %ebp 8048391 : 51 push %ecx 8048392 : 83 ec 04 sub $ 0x4 , %esp 8048395 : c7 04 24 64 84 04 08 movl $ 0x8048464 , ( %esp ) 804839 c : e8 07 ff ff ff call 80482a8 < puts@plt > 80483a1 : b8 00 00 00 00 mov $ 0x0 , %eax ... C言語でのputs ( ) は、 の call になっています。こ の は、libc内 のputs関数ではありません。本物のputs関数を呼び出すwrapperのようなものです。libc内のputs関数が、実行時にどのアドレスに貼り付けられるかは、実行時にしかわかりませんので、ここにアドレスを書くことはできないわけです。
ということだけ覚えておいて を見ると、 % objdump -d hell o2 | grep - A 10 '< puts@plt > :' 080482a8 < puts@plt > : 80482a8 : ff 25 5 c 95 04 08 jmp *0x804955 c 80482ae : 68 00 00 00 00 push $ 0x0 80482b3 : e9 e0 ff ff ff jmp 8048298 < _init+0x18 > 080482b8 < __libc_start_main@plt > : 80482b8 : ff 25 60 95 04 08 jmp *0x8049560 80482be : 68 08 00 00 00 push $ 0x8 80482c3 : e9 d0 ff ff ff jmp 8048298 < _init+0x18 > 080482c8 < __gmon_start__@plt > : ... となっています。 先頭行 ( 80482a8 の jmp * 0x804955c ) に注目。アドレ ス 0x804955c に格納されている値にジャンプすることになっています。この、アドレス 0x804955c 周辺がGOT( Global Offset Table ) という 間接ジャンプテーブル です。ちなみに、 などが存在するアドレス周辺は PLT ( Procedure Linkage Table ) と呼ばれています 。
GOT とPLTの開始アドレスは、readelfコマンドでセクション情報を表示させれば得ることができます。それぞれ、0x08048298と0x0804954cのようです。
% readelf - S hell o2 | egrep -e '( .got | .plt ) ' [ 11 ] .plt PROGBITS 08048298 000298 000040 04 AX 0 0 4 [ 20 ] .got PROGBITS 0804954c 00054c 000004 04 WA 0 0 4
遅延BIND
で、肝心の 「 アドレス 0x804955 c の値」ですが、これは dynamic linker が実行時に決めます。dynamic linker がいつどのように決めるかの戦略は二種類あります。 オブジェクトがロードされた時（プログラムの起動時）に、dynamic linkerが全て のGOT のエントリに本当の関数のアドレス( libc.soのputsなど) を埋める
オブジェクトがロードされた時（プログラムの起動時）には、GOTに特別な値を入れておき、本当の関数のアドレス調査を、その関数の初回呼び出し時まで遅延する
どちらの戦略を取るかは、プログラムをリンクするときに決めることができます*3。 % gcc - Wall -o hell o2 - Wl , -z , now hell o2.c % readelf -d hell o2 | grep NOW 0x00000018 ( BIND_NOW ) 0x6 ffffffb ( FLAGS_1 ) フラグ : NOW 上記のように 、 - Wl でリン カ( ld ) に -z now オプションを渡せば1.の戦略が取られます。1. なオブジェクトかどうかは、readelf -d すればわかります。1. の戦略が取られた場合、 の先頭のjmpで、いきなりlibc.soのputsに制御が移ります。まさに単なるwrapperです。わかりやすいですね。
080482a8 < puts@plt > : 80482a8 : ff 25 5 c 95 04 08 jmp *0x804955 c 80482ae : 68 00 00 00 00 push $ 0x0 そうではなく、 - z now を渡さなかった場 合 、 2.の戦略が取られます( lazy relocation ) 。こちらがデフォルトです 。PLTは2.の戦略のため（など）に存在しています。
2. の戦略の場合、 「 アドレス 0x804955c の値」は、デフォルトで
の2行目になっています。ここでは、0x80482ae ですね。ですから、jmp先は の2行目(次の行!)ということになります。0x80482ae から先は、dynamic linker(具体的には__dl_runtime_resolve関数 ) に、「 アドレス 0x804955c の値」を本物のputs関数のアドレスに書き換えてもらった上で、本物のputs関数にジャンプする処理になっています*4。objdump結果を読んだり、gdbでstepiして追ったりすればわかります。2.の戦略の場合でも、2度目以降の 呼び出しでは、 の先頭のjmpで、いきなりlibc.soのputsに制御が移ります(1度目で「アドレス 0x804955c の値」が書きかわるため ) 。
ここまでのまと め
(1 ) 別のsoの関数呼びは、次のよう にPLT を経由する。 % objdump -d hell o2 | grep - A 10 ' < main > :' 08048384 < main > : ... 804839 c : e8 07 ff ff ff call 80482a8 < puts@plt > ( 2 ) PLTの先頭で 、GOT ( のputs用のエントリ)に書かれているアドレスにジャンプする。このアドレスは次のどちらかである。 libc.soのputsのアドレス
の 2行 目 080482a8 < puts@plt > : 80482a8 : ff 25 5 c 95 04 08 jmp *0x804955 c 80482ae : 68 00 00 00 00 push $ 0x0
GOT overwrite attack の実 験
というように、PLT経由の関数呼び出しはいろいろめんどくさいんですけど、攻撃するのは非常に簡単です。" format string bug " 等の、 「 アドレス空間中の任意の4バイトを書き換え可能」なプログラムの欠陥を悪用して、GOT(の例えばputs関数用)の値をお好きな値Xに書き換えてしまえば良いわけです。そうすれば、プログラムが次にputsを呼ぼうとした瞬間に、PLT経由でアドレスXのコードが実行されます。
実際に試してみましょう。次のコードを gcc hello.c -o hello でコンパイルします。 // hello.c ( IA32 ) # include < stdio.h > # include < stdlib.h > # include < unistd.h > static int my_puts ( const char* s ) { write ( 1 , " HEHE
" , 5 ) ; _exit ( 1 ) ; } int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { unsigned int* got_addr = ( unsigned int * ) strtoul ( argv [ 1 ] , NULL , 16 ) ; * got_addr = ( unsigned int ) my_puts ; puts ( " hello " ) ; return 0 ; } 次に 、GOT ( のputs用エントリの場所 ) を調べます。 % objdump -d hello | grep - A 1 '< puts@plt > ' 08048324 < puts@plt > : 8048324 : ff 25 68 96 04 08 jmp *0x8049668 ...
0x8049668 らしいので、そこを書き換えるように指定しつつ hello を実行します。 % ./hello 0x8049678 HEHE puts ( " hello
" ) ; を呼んだはずが、my_puts ( )
が呼ばれてしまいました。簡単に攻撃成功です。
GOT overwrite attack 防御
GOT を書き込み禁止にしてしまえばこの問題は解決します。
普段から書き込み禁止にしておいて、dynamic linker がGOTをいじる瞬間だけdynamic linkerが自ら、mprotect(2)で書き込み許可を出す方法もありますが、これはmprotectの呼び出し回数が多くなってしまい、非常にコストがかかる（実行が遅くなる）そうで、現実的ではないそうです。
そこで、 遅延BIND しない。プログラム実行開始時にGOT を全部書き換える
全部書き換え終わったら、GOTを書き込み禁止にする
という現実的な方法が考えられました。gccの-Wlオプションをちょっといじるだけでこういう動作にできます。 % gcc - Wall - g -o hello_ro - Wl , -z , now , -z , relro hello3.c % objdump -d hello_ro | grep - A 1 '< puts@plt > :' 08048344 < puts@plt > : 8048344 : ff 25 e8 9f 04 08 jmp *0x8049fe8 % ./hello_ro 0x8049fe8 zsh : segmentation fault ./hello_ro 0x8049fe8 確かに、SEGVしてくれました。どこでSEGVしたかを一応確認すると、 % catchsegv ./hello_ro 0x8049fe8 ***

The union would initially receive a 17.5 percent stake to finance a health care trust for its retirees .
It has also received warrants to raise that holding to 20 percent  but those warrants are exercisable only if new G.M. ’s value hits $ 75 billion .
Once the union and bondholders achieve their full stakes , the government ’s share would drop to 55 percent .
The hope is to create a new G.M. by late August , people with knowledge of the matter said .
During a briefing on Thursday , administration officials said they expected that G.M. would emerge from bankruptcy in 60 to 90 days , but would probably not be a publicly traded company until sometime later , possibly after a public offering .
Until then , there would not be a ready market for the equity holdings of former bondholders and others .
The administration officials said that G.M. ’s balance sheet going forward could make a $ 15 billion market capitalization possible within a relatively short period of time , but did not offer details on how its value would rise to that level .
The current market capitalization , said an administration official close to the negotiations , reflected a capital structure that was unacceptable .
G.M. ’s current market capitalization is about $ 683.8 million ; it was close to $ 22 billion a few years ago .
( By comparison , Toyota is now worth $ 123 billion , and its market capitalization was $ 200 billion in 2006 . )
G.M. bondholders rejected the initial offer because they were upset that the U.A.W. ’s health care trust , to which G.M. owes $ 20 billion , received a larger stake than the debt holders , who were owed $ 27 billion .
Under the proposal , bondholders conceivably will outrank the health care trust , once the warrants are exercised .
Not only does that soothe any ruffled feelings , but it will create good will with the lenders G.M. will need to tap after it emerges from bankruptcy .
On the other hand , the union will hold debt and preferred stock that helps guarantee its health care trust will be financed even if the new company falters .
D7 Tech DEMO : Plastic Logic
Amazon ( AMZN ) is n’t the only company that wants you to read books and newspapers on a handheld device .
The Kindle has a bevy of competitors , some of which already exist–like Sony ’s ( SNE ) Reader–and those that have yet to hit the market .
Plastic Logic falls in the second category .
The Silicon Valley - based company ’s device , which every D7 attendee will receive , wo n’t be on the market until next year .
But today the company will provide an update on the device ’s progress and show off some interesting features , including a first look at the gadget ’s touchscreen user interface .
Look ma , no keyboard !
Session Highlights
Live Blog
Walt and Kara welcome CEO Richard Archuleta and Product Manager Anusha Nirmalananthan onstage .
The pitch : The Plastic Logic e-reader is designed for business use –“ relaxing reading ” and documents .
The Reader looks a lot like a Kindle DX .
But again , note that there ’s no keyboard , just a touchscreen–based on technology specific to Plastic Logic .
Transistors made out of plastic ( hence name ) .
Shows off transistor with Walt ’s image imprinted .
Cool / scary .
Today : a first look at the UI , which has n’t been shown before .
The demo duo show a cover of Fortune magazine .
A tap of the touchscreen brings up a toolbar showing tabs with recently read documents .
The next view , a bit delayed , shows “ business documents . ”
You turn pages with swipe gestures ( familiar to iPhone users ) .
Kara asks about lag between pages , but is assured that this will improve over time .
Open platform : PDF , Word , Excel , Powerpoint .
If you can print it out , you can use it .
Will there be an e-commerce platform a la Kindle ?
Yes .
The e-commerce site that is n’t online yet , but customers will be able to buy and / or subscribe to books and magazines .
Pricing ?
Not set yet .
Archuleta : “ We ’re actually in discussions with some of the people in the audience about that right now . ”
The device will have both 3G wireless a la Kindle and Apple ’s ( AAPL ) iPhone , and WiFi a la iPhone .
Walt :
So battery life is 15 minutes ?
Archuleta : Nope .
We ’re being smart , trying to figure optimal way to move content .
Kara seems to have busted the screen by hitting it too hard .
Careful , Kara !
Kara now wants to know why it ’s not flexible .
Archuleta :
We did user testing , and what users told us was that flexible made them “ a little nervous . ”
That surprised us , but we made it firmer .
Color ?
“ Coming , but not next year . ”
Trade off is color image vs. easy - to - read text [ some of Plastic Logic ’s competitors disagree , by the way ] .
Kindle ?
We ’re optimized for business users .
[ So is the $ 359 Kindle , no ? ]
Business users require lots of different types of content .
Not just about books at all .
“ A very different usage case . ”
What ’s it going to cost ?
Nope .
Higher or lower than $ 500 ?
“ The market sets pricing .
We do n’t set pricing . ”
Groans from audience .
Kara reminds audience they get it for free , so stop griping !

1. Choose a number between 1 and 10 .
Got it ?
Ok .
2 . Take that number and multiply by 9 .
This should n't be too tricky , but take your time .
3 . If your number is a two - digit number , add the numbers together .
If not , skip ahead .
Ok .
4 . Now , subtract 5 from the number .
I think I 'm getting close here .
Just a few more questions .
5 . Line your number up with its corresponding letter of the alphabet .
So , 1=A , 2=B , 3=C , 4=D , 5=E , etc .
6 . Think of a country that begins with the letter you 've got .
Now , this is important , and where things get hard , so when you 've got your country , I want you to concentrate on it VERY HARD for a few seconds .
I 'll be here in the internet , trying to intercept your brainwaves .
7 . Next , you need to envision an animal whose name begins with the LAST letter of the country you were just thinking about .
The picture 's almost clear .
One or two more steps and I 'll have you .
8 . Finally , take the last letter of that animal and think of a fruit that BEGINS with that same letter .
Now hold it in your mind !!
I think it 's coming clear finally ... . . . . . . .
Some interesting observations about my experience in shipping commercial software .
It seems like the notion of closed source is n’t really working .
Torkel has developed an application using the NH Prof architecture , peeked via reflector .
And no , I do n’t really mind .
The part that really blew me away was when I started getting patches for NH Prof .
No , they did n’t have the code , but they were able to :
Follow a pretty complex internal interaction
Isolate the actual part that caused their problem
Provide a solution and send it to me
From my part , I was able to just take their solution , apply it and commit , resulting in a build that they could download in a very short time .
So far , it seems to be working .
Posted on 06 April 2009 by ShepRamsey
I was n’t really that drawn in by the trailers for this weekend ’s Adventureland .
It looked like one of the many late teen / early twenty - something sex comedies that usually suck and all kinda run together after awhile .
Nothing in the trailer was particularly funny , although it seemed as if it was trying really hard to be .
It was chock full of pseudo - laughs drawn from goofy random moments .
And to add to that , it made absolutely certain that you knew that it was “ from the director of Superbad , ” even going so far as to preserve the font used for that film ’s promotional material , so that it catches the eye and there ’s no confusion as to which Superbad they ’re talking about .
It makes sense .
Being associated with Superbad is definitely something I ’d want people to know , as it ’s a terrific example of when late teen / early twenty - something sex comedies are actually good and successful .
And while Adventureland covers similar territory as Superbad , it ’s really not the film you think you ’re buying a ticket for based on that selling point .
No , friends , it ’s actually much better !
It ’s currently enjoying a staggering 88 % on RottenTomatoes , and I think I ’m okay with that .
It has that indie - dramedy Garden State kind of feel to it ( only it ’s way more honest and compelling , and way less up its own ass than Garden State ) .
While it ’s a serious and perceptive film about budding love , youth , and all their complications , it is reasonably funny , but in a nostalgic real - life sort of way .
Jokes in the trailer that fell flat for me were far funnier in the context of the movie , thanks to Greg Mottola ’s sensitive direction and the frankly stellar performances by all involved .
So why make such a trailer ?
I get wanting to sell it as something else that was really successful and not totally a horse of a different color , but when your film is n’t the dopey raunchy comedy that people expected ( and wanted ) , then word - of - mouth will get around and you ’ll see some pretty hefty box - office drop - off after the film ’s first weekend .
Kinda like Watchmen .
And this is far from the first time that this has happened and it wo n’t be the last .
Here are five more examples of times when Hollywood was ashamed of its movies .
1. Bridge to Terabithia
To watch the trailer for this Walt Disney / Walden Media family picture , you ’d think it was an epic modern - day fantasy yarn where two mischevious kids stumble across a magical land of fairies and tree - monsters just beyond their own backyards .
We watch these kids revel in those such discoveries as font sprinkled in fairy dust tells us “ Just across the stream … something incredible …is waiting to be found . ”
And then cue the majestic voice - over guy who says “ This winter , when you go looking for adventure , be prepared to find more than you ever imagined . ”
As someone who read the book as a kid , I was flustered and confused by this trailer and feared they were going the wrong way entirely with the material .
But , I was wrong .
Nay , the trailer was wrong .
It ’s a wholesome and touching little film about the friendship shared by the two young leads .
The imagination - land that they create in the woods is merely their way of dealing with the rough patches of childhood and takes up all of fifteen or twenty minutes of the movie .
Like the trailer for Adventureland , this one latches onto something that holds a totally different meaning in the final movie , dumbs it down , and uses it as a selling point for the whole thing .
I ca n’t imagine what unsuspecting parents and kids must have thought when they went to the film and saw , not only , that there was little fantasy involved but that ( SPOILER ! ) the little girl dies .
It ’s a great story and a tearjerker to end all tearjerkers , but you just would n’t know that from that damn trailer .
2. Bug
Geez , talk about a movie that was marketed all wrong !
The trailer starts off with creepy music and occasional loud percussion beats to accent something that ’s supposed to be omnious and evil .
We watch as Ashley Judd gets drawn to Michael Shannon ( and the music just screams “ they think they ’re ok … but they ’re wrong ! ! ” ) .
And then the voice - over gets real throaty and demon - like , telling us “ They live in your blood , ” while we see close up shots of people ’s skin and some microscope - views of blood flowing through your veins , followed by an exchange between Judd and Shannon : “ What is that ? ” “ It ’s a bug . ” and pretty soon “ This place is crawling with these things . ”
Poor Ashley and Michael start to get nuttier and nuttier , tearing apart their flesh and resorting to maddening violence and mayhem .
And it ’s during this rapidlyly - cut montage of loud maniacal music growing more loud and maniacal , that the V.O. takes time to mention ( not unlike the Adventureland trailer ) that the film is from the director of The Exorcist , and even reads off a quote from the Chicago Tribune , calling it “ one of the most disturbing horror movies imaginable . ”
And while I can’t exactly say that I disagree with that quote , the finished movie here is worlds different from the movie they advertise in this trailer .
It ’s a very quiet , dialogue - driven film , based on a stage - play .
At no point in this film are we expected to think that the bugs are anything more than the psychotic delusions of an escaped mental patient ( Shannon ) and the sad , lonely woman ( Judd ) who has chosen to believe him .
It ’s a character - based black - as - hell comedy about paranoia elevated to its most intense extremes .
That ’s not to say it ’s not incredibly disturbing .
If you have the patience for it , the finished product is severe enough to jostle just about anyone .
But to label it as straight “ the - insects - are - coming - for - us ” horror is just plain wrong !
And I also take issue with using “ from the director of The Exorcist ” to label William Friedkin as a horror director .
Hell , even that movie was n’t a straight fright flick !
It was about something larger and the horror came from within it–and Bug is much the same way .
3. The Exorcism of Emily Rose
The trailer for 2005′s The Exorcism of Emily Rose is actually a pretty good and interesting trailer for a horror movie .
But what the final product is , is even more interesting .
The film is about a priest ( Tom Wilkinson ) on trial for the murder of a girl who died during an exorcism .
The trailer makes it look more like this fact is the jumping off point for a horror film that not only detail the events of the exorcism ( which the movie does ) , but it makes many a subtle implication that the horror is n’t over after that .
With the music and fast cutting and constant display of eerie ominous visions , the trailer gives off the impression that this film is straight horror all the way .
( It even uses the ol ’ “ Based on a true story ” tag that I hate so much to get people ’s blood to curdle a little more . )
But when you see that actual movie , it ’s really more of a courtroom drama and all of the creepy visions that we saw were from the film ’s flashback scenes detailing the alleged possession and exorcism of the titular character , Emily Rose .
And perhaps this was a major folly of the film itself .
With such a straight - edged courtroom focus most of the time , the flashback scenes , which are played up to extreme levels of supernatural horror , seem like they were awkwardly shoved in there so that they would have something cool - looking to put in the trailer .
The title , too , implies a film more in the vein of paranormal macabre .
I do n’t really know why they chose to go this route .
Exorcist : The Beginning was released a year prior with pretty disappointing results and everyone knows that Americans love a good courtroom drama .
The film was ultimately pretty successful anyway , pulling in $ 75 million domestically , more than tripling its $ 20 million budget .
4. Man of the Year
This looked like something that might–and I stress might–be good .
I like the premise , anyway .
Robin Williams plays a TV host for a politically - themed comedic talk show , sort of a Jon Stewart / Bill Maher type .
When his adoring audience suggests that he run for president to help right the wrongs he ’s always poking fun at , he decides to go for it .
And would n’t you know it ?
He wins !
The trailer for this film plays it up like the political satire that it should have been ( except that it does n’t really look like a good version of that movie ) .
Williams has some good one - liners including “ I did not have sex with that woman … I wanted to… , ” but the trailer is consistently goofy and naive and it just looks like a white - people rehash of Head of State .
And then you actually see the movie and you ’re dealing with something else entirely –and it ’s even worse !
Director Barry Levinson ’s film is more in the vein of a drama , sometimes a little funny , but always standing at a distance from the comedy and even from Williams , who feels more like a side character .
And all hell breaks loose when eventually it winds up actually being kind of a thriller .
The main problem with the movie is that Levinson , who did satire so well with Wag the Dog , seems to have no recollection of the term here .
It feels like halfway through he thought to himelf “ Wait , wait , wait !
This would never happen , that ’s ridiculous ! ” and spent the rest of the movie awkwardly borrowing from every genre he could think of to try and rationalize things that would ’ve been best left unrationalized .
Ultimately the film was sold as something that it totally was n’t .
I ’m guessing this was because the studio looked at the ugly clusterfuck that was Man of the Year and had no idea how one would go about marketing a film that gave them entirely too many options .
5. Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street
There were a few trailers out for this one and all of them reveled in showing the ever - popular Johnny Depp looking dark and brooding and slashing open people ’s throats with a razor .
What they failed to accent , however , was the fact that Depp would be singing at the same time .
I can only recall one of the trailers for this movie that showed any singing whatsoever and it was awkwardly shoved in the middle of the trailer , as if to say “ ohbythewayitsamusical ” and get on with key selling points like Johnny Depp and throat - slashing .
I imagine it was quite a shock for many poor unfortunate males clinging desperately to their precious masculinity , when they showed up at this “ killin ’ - people ” movie only to see Depp busting out in song like a goddamn pansy .
Poor guys .
I guess Tim Burton pulled a fast one on ‘ em .
To watch the movie , it ’s surprising that they could fashion a coherent trailer for the film with minimal or no singing , as the whole thing is about 80 % song .
Obviously there ’s a lot of dependence on the voice - over guy for exposition and since there is n’t any dancing , they have a lot of sans - audio shots to choose from to cut together in montage as the instrumental score plays overtop .
As a result , they thankfully do n’t have to sell the film as if it were Mamma Mia or Hairspray .
This is another film which I guess is a tough sell .
Because most fans of musicals have little desire to watch blood being spilled from the throats of unsuspecting Londoners and most fans of blood being spilled from the throats of unsuspecting Londoners have little desire to watch musicals .
Seeing as , conceptually , this film may have been doomed from the start , the trailers chose the only path they could think of : Johnny Depp .
It ’s a shame that good movies ( except Man of the Year ) need to be sold to the American public in their most dumbed - down and misleadingly accessible forms .
It ’s a shame that people seem to automatically classify something that they ’ve never seen before as “ weird ” and shun it .
It ’s a shame that no one has any taste , vision , imagination , or patience for good storytelling anymore .
Adventureland was a very good little movie .
Not perfect , but very good .
And because the majority of American audiences do n’t like good movies ( and because marketing execs know that ) , the people who should n’t see it will walk out disappointed , while the people who should wo n’t even walk in .
However , if misleading trailers can still be made for films that might not be so easy to market to the masses , thus allowing these movies to continue being made , then …well … I guess I ’m okay with that .

The Streets Department permit was the outcome of a drive spearheaded by animal activist Lisa Levinson to keep the green - and - brown amphibians - identified by naturalist Doug Wechsler as American toads - from being squashed by cars using the side roads to avoid stoplights on Ridge Avenue .
A 20 - year - old man 's hand was nearly severed by an assailant wielding what is thought to be a samurai sword last night in Palmerston North .
Both the man 's hands were badly injured by the assailant who had shown up uninvited to a large gathering of young people on Linton Street , Detective Senior Sergeant Craig Sheridan said .
The victim was being treated in Wellington Hospital .
Police were interviewing a large number of people about the attack and it would take several days to piece together what happened , he said .
There had been other reports of fighting and assaults in the area last night , which might be related to this assault , Mr Sheridan said .
About 10.35 pm a young man was knocked to the ground on Chelwood St by an unknown assailant .
He did not require hospitalisation , Mr Sheridan said .
Shortly after midnight a 15 - year - old was hit over the head with a bottle on Pioneer Highway .
He had been with a group of friends when a van load of men pulled over and confronted them , Mr Sheridan said .
One of the men hit the boy with a drink bottle cutting his head .
He was treated at Palmerston North Hospital , then discharged .

The World Health Organisation ( WHO ) today increased its global tally of confirmed swine flu cases to more than 2,300 , as British scientists announced they had worked out the full genetic code for the virus .
Five new cases were diagnosed in the UK today – four schoolchildren and an adult linked to Alleyn's School in Dulwich , south London , which has been closed all week after six pupils were diagnosed with the illness .
There are now 39 confirmed cases in the UK .
Mexico remains the worst affected country , with more than 1,100 laboratory - confirmed human cases of H1N1 virus influenza , including 42 deaths .
The United States has reported nearly 900 laboratory - confirmed human cases , including two deaths .
Another 22 countries have confirmed cases but no deaths .
The latest figures came as the health secretary , Alan Johnson , said the Health Protection Agency , which monitors infectious diseases , had fully mapped the genetic code of the virus .
He said this would help scientists to understand how the virus operates and to identify the parts that can be used to manufacture a vaccine .
On a visit to a laboratory in Hertfordshire , he was told that researchers hope European manufacturers will be able to take delivery of prototypes in the coming months to enable mass production of a vaccine to begin .
Johnson said : " A significant step towards protecting the world 's health against swine flu has been taken .
We now look to the vaccine industry to produce the required quantities of vaccine as quickly as possible . "
The entire genetic fingerprint and sequence of the swine flu virus will now be analysed to learn how the virus behaves as it infects individuals .
At a meeting of Asian health ministers in Bangkok today , the WHO director general , Dr Margaret Chan , said the world was " better prepared for an influenza pandemic than at any time in history " , largely because of precautions taken over the threat of bird flu .
She said : " Years of alert and expectation mean that most countries now have preparedness plans .
Vaccine manufacturing capacity has increased sharply .
Large stocks of antiviral drugs have been produced and procured .
" Right now , treatment courses from the WHO stockpile are being shipped to more than 70 countries in the developing world . "
Mexico's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva said he would raise concerns at the WHO annual meeting later this month about " discriminatory " measures imposed against the country , its people , and its exports because of the flu .
China has placed dozens of Mexicans in forced quarantine as a protective measure against the spread of the virus .
Around the world , public opinion seems to be shifting from fear of a pandemic to scepticism as to whether the virus poses a significant threat .
Half of 2,000 Britons surveyed yesterday said they believe the government over - hyped the threat of swine flu , and are now less worried about it spreading .
The research by online polling centre Toluna found two - thirds of respondents thought the government had coped well with the outbreak , while more than half ( 54 % ) thought the NHS was well prepared to cope with a possible pandemic .
The report noted a decline in public worry about the virus spreading , with 40 % worried about the virus , compared with 50 % last week .
Public health officials around the world acknowledge their worst fears about the new virus have yet to materialise .
But many experts worry that people will become too complacent and fail to heed warnings if the virus returns in a more dangerous form in the autumn .
" People are taking a sigh of relief too soon , " said Dr Richard Besser , acting director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention .
" The measures we 've been talking about – the importance of hand - washing , the importance of covering coughs , the real responsibility for staying home when you 're sick and keeping your children home when you 're sick – I 'm afraid that people are going to say , ' Ah , we 've dodged a bullet .
We do n't need to do that , ' " he said .

I am hesitant to write this essay because the first time I explored the relationship between atonement theology and justifications for torture in public , a woman spit in my face .
Two years ago , I presented a paper at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Religion about the effects of interpreting the photographs from Abu Ghraib as crucifixion images .
I proposed that versions of atonement theology that frame the violence on the cross as “ salvific ” and “ necessary ” influence how Christians understand torture .
I pointed out that the United States government uses a version of atonement theology to sanction torture and abuse : soldiers and military police are ordered to use “ harsh techniques to gain information to save lives ” ; they “ felt pressure to obtain information that could help save the lives of American soldiers . ” [ 1 ]
Might atonement theologies and images of the crucifixion prepare Christians to see torture as salvific ?
After my presentation , a woman from the audience spit in my face .
People at the Pew Research Center might want to keep an eye out for her .
I think the results of their survey released last week lend support to my proposal that some forms of Christianity have prepared some Christians in some communities to understand torture as salvific , necessary , and justified .
The results of the survey revealed that those who attend weekly church services are more likely than those who rarely or never attend services to say the use of torture on suspected terrorists is justifiable .
Going to church increases the likelihood that people will support torture , especially if they are white evangelical Protestants .
This is not good news .
But is it a surprise ?
Almost immediately after the publication of the photographs from Abu Ghraib in 2004 , commentators began to refer to them as crucifixion images , likening the pictured bodies to the “ mortified Christ . ”
Most particularly mentioned the “ hooded man ’s ” similarity ; insisting that that “ the image is particularly evocative for Christian viewers . ” [ 2 ]
Commentator after commentator insisted that the “ symbol of the Christ figure ” was “ unmistakable ” in the images of prisoners tied to jail bars and handcuffed to beds ; of prisoners standing with their arms stretched out , palms facing upward . [ 3 ]
Even one of the soldiers engaged in the abuse thought the detainees looked like Jesus .
In a letter written home while she was stationed at Abu Ghraib , Private Sabrina Harman wrote , “ I cant [ sic ] get it out of my head .
I walk down the stairs after blowing the whistle and beating on the cells with a [ baton ] to find ‘ The taxicab driver ’ handcuffed backwards to his window naked with his underwear over his head and face .
He looked like Jesus Christ . ” [ 4 ]
How violence is interpreted shapes how people respond to it .
The comparison of the photographs from Abu Ghraib to crucifixion images suggests that the violence in those photographs has been seen through the lens of the crucifixion , and that this theological story has shaped how torture is understood .
What does this interpretation reveal about the relationship between theologies of atonement and torture ?
Are Christians theologically prepared to accept torture ?
Even to practice it ?
I do not presume to know the answers to these questions , but I hope Christian communities will be brave enough to ask them .
I hope the results of the Pew survey will challenge Christians to ask difficult , critical , uncomfortable questions about what happens in churches on Sunday mornings .
Despite our intentions , how might the words of our liturgies justify torture ?
How might the images hanging in our churches justify torture ?
How might our theology justify torture ?
How might the very symbols that give comfort also cause harm ?
What needs to change ?
When I am teaching about the photographs from Abu Ghraib , I sometimes put an image of the crucifixion on the screen and ask students what phrases come to mind when they see this image .
“ He died for us , ” some say .
“ By His wounds , we are healed , ” others say .
Still others call the violence “ cleansing ” and “ necessary , ” “ payment for our sins , ” a “ ransom , ” a “ gift . ”
If you believe that a man was tortured to save your life , if you believe that the violence on the cross was necessary , if you believe God demanded Jesus ’ death on the cross , how do those beliefs affect how you understand violence more generally ?
At the center of Christianity is a man who was tortured .
How this event is understood , interpreted , and believed in will , at least in part , shape how Christians understand torture .
What kind of interpretation of the crucifixion might generate an anti-torture response ?
In his sworn statement about his experience at Abu Ghraib , Ameen Sa’eed Al - Sheikh details what the guards did to him : they beat his broken leg , threatened to rape him and his wife , threatened to kill him , put a gun to his head , deprived him of blankets and clothing , drew pictures of women on his back , made him stand naked and hold his buttocks , urinated on him , hung him from his bed using handcuffs until he lost consciousness , hung him from the cell door , took photographs of him , forced him to eat pork and to drink liquor .
In the middle of his deposition , Al - Sheikh said ”
Someone else asked me , “ Do you believe in anything ? ” I said to him , “ I believe in Allah . ”
So he said , “ But I believe in torture and I will torture you … ”
Then they handcuffed me and hung me to my bed .
They ordered me to curse Islam and because they hit my broken leg , I cursed my religion .
They ordered me to thank Jesus I ’m alive .
And I did what they ordered me .
This is against my belief . [ 5 ]
What will it take to make torture against Christians ’ belief ?

SHAHEEN , BOXER , KLOBUCHAR DENOUNCE OBSTRUCTION OF RESOLUTION CONDEMNING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS
Senators were urged to eliminate references to reproductive health
( Washington , DC ) - Following the recent tragic shooting death of Dr. George Tiller , a reproductive health care provider in Kansas , U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen ( D - NH ) , Barbara Boxer ( D - CA ) , and Amy Klobuchar ( D - MN ) authored a non-controversial resolution condemning the use of violence against providers of women 's health care services .
The resolution faced objection by some colleagues on the other side of the aisle , and the Senators were urged to eliminate references to women 's reproductive health care in order to unanimously pass the resolution .
Shaheen , Boxer , and Klobuchar introduced their original resolution , which was co-sponsored by an additional 43 Senators .
" I realize that the issue of reproductive choice is divisive and that there are many heartfelt feelings on both sides of the aisle , " said Shaheen .
" However , I was hopeful that , regardless of our differences of opinion on this sensitive issue , the Senate could come together and pass a resolution that rejects the use of violence against women 's health care providers .
It is a sad day when the elected leaders of the greatest Democracy on earth can't agree to protect those exercising their constitutional rights . "
" Everyone has the right to work for changes in the law , but there is no place for violence in any of our debates , " said Boxer .
" To assault a health care worker , a patient or anyone else because of a disagreement about an issue , regardless of how contentious , brings all of humanity down into a dark pit of violence . "
" As a former prosecutor I have seen how acts of violence can tear apart communities , " said Klobuchar .
" No matter how heated the debate or how great our differences , violence is never the answer .
Supporting a bipartisan bill that denounces the use of violence is basic common sense and we need to pass this without further delay . "
Last week , the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed a resolution condemning violence in places of worship .
Shaheen , Boxer and Klobuchar were asked adopt the House language in the Senate , but decided to move forward with their resolution , as they feel condemning violence against women 's health care providers and agreeing not to use violence as a means of resolving differences are not objectionable viewpoints .
The Senate resolution was sponsored by Senators Shaheen , Boxer , and Klobuchar .
It was co-sponsored by Senators Murray ; Durbin ; Dodd ; Schumer ; Lautenberg ; Mikulski ; Landrieu ; Gillibrand ; Harkin ; Carper ; Sanders ; Kaufman ; Wyden ; Kerry ; Lieberman ; Tom Udall ; Levin ; Brown ; Whitehouse ; Burris ; Mark Udall ; Stabenow ; Baucus ; Cantwell ; Bingaman ; Inouye ; Cardin ; Specter ; Johnson ; Feingold ; Leahy ; Tester ; Snowe ; Begich ; Akaka ; Bennet ; Feinstein ; Warner ; McCaskill ; Reed ; Kennedy , Lincoln ; and Merkley .
The full text of the resolution follows :
RESOLUTION ( S.Res.187 )
Condemning the use of violence against providers of health care services to women .
Whereas Dr. George Tiller of Wichita , Kansas was shot to death at church on Sunday , May 31 ;
Whereas there is a history of violence against providers of reproductive health care , as health care employees have suffered threats and hostility in order to provide crucial services to patients ;
Whereas the threat or use of force or physical obstruction has been used to injure , intimidate , or interfere with individuals seeking to obtain or provide health care services ; and
Whereas acts of violence are never an acceptable means of expression and always shall be condemned :
Now , therefore , be it
Resolved , That the Senate ---
(1) Expresses great sympathy for the family , friends and patients of Dr. George Tiller ;
(2) Recognizes that acts of violence should never be used to prevent women from receiving reproductive health care ; and
(3) Condemns the use of violence as a means of resolving differences of opinion .

I have never seen a network so devoted to a wingnut cause like FOX is with their BIG coverage of the teabaggers tea party scheduled for April 15th .
Check out this video clip I made just from one show .
Wall Street gladly took their $ 700 billion wingnut welfare cash without blinking an eye -- with Neil Cavuto demanding McCain 's people cough up the cash for his peeps -- but somehow Rick Santelli 's rant against " losers " who are having trouble paying their mortgages was just an incredible faux outrage and has become dear to Roger Ailes heart .
It 's the rich and out - of - power Republicans who are organizing these events , and it 's not an accident .
They are trying to kick - start a broken conservative movement by making a huge effort to tap into the 25 % of people who hate President Obama .
Roger Ailes has gone " all in " and is waiting for the river card as he uses Beck , Cavuto and his merry band of disenfranchised conservatives to lead them on their disingenuous mission .
Digby explains :
Here 's the thing .
The right lost its ability to be spontaneous sometime back when Phyllis Schlafly was pounding the ERA .
They require structure and leadership in order to function , which is one reason why their movement and their party are so stuck .
( They proudly call themselves dittoheads , after all . )
So , it 's no surprise to learn this : Despite these attempts to make the “ movement ” appear organic , the principle organizers of the local events are actually the lobbyist - run think tanks Americans for Prosperity and Freedom Works .
The two groups are heavily staffed and well funded , and are providing all the logistical and public relations work necessary for planning coast - to - coast protests : – Freedom Works staffers coordinate conference calls among protesters , contacting conservative activists to give them “ sign ideas , sample press releases , and a map of events around the country . ” – Freedom
Works staffers apparently moved to “ take over ” the planning of local events in Florida .
– Freedom Works provides how - to guides for delivering a “ clear message ” to the public and media .
– Freedom Works has several domain addresses — some of them made to look like they were set up by amateurs — to promote the protests .
– Americans for Prosperity is writing press releases and planning the events in New Jersey , Arizona , New Hampshire , Missouri , Kansas , and several other states .
This type of corporate ‘ astroturfing ‘ is nothing new to either organization .
While working to promote Social Security privatization , Freedom Works was caught planting one of its operatives as a “ single mom ” to ask questions to President Bush in a town hall on the subject .
Last year , the Wall Street Journal exposed Freedom Works for similarly building “ amateur - looking ” websites to promote the lobbying interests of Dick Armey , the former Republican Majority Leader who now leads Freedom Works and is a lobbyist for the firm DLA Piper .
Americans for Prosperity is run by Tim Phillips , who was Ralph Reed ’s former partner in the lobbying firm Century Strategies .
The group is funded by Koch family foundations — a family whose wealth is derived from the oil industry .
Indeed Americans for Prosperity has coordinated pro-drilling ‘ grassroots ‘ events around the country .
If any members of the press are reading this , I hope they can see that this is the story , not the sad little dupes who are voluntarily calling themselves tea - baggers .

What about you ?
This article was originally written as a chapter for Emergency : This Book Will Save Your Life , but did n't appear in the final version and is presented here as a Reality Sandwich exclusive .
As part of my quest to get off the grid , I met Christopher Nyerges , who runs the School of Self - Reliance , and ten other students on a Saturday afternoon at in Altadena , California for an edible plant walk .
He wore a blue button - down over a white polo shirt and a straw brimmed hat with a purple bandana wrapped around it .
Over one shoulder was a backpack with the tip of a bow drill sticking out .
He looked equal parts golfer , zoologist , and Indiana Jones .
Nyerges led us on a mile - long trail hike , feeding us the little yellow flowers of mustard plants , which were tasteless except for a slight kick on the way down ; the sweet , juicy celerylike buds that lay inside the stalk of young bull thistle ; the succulent , cucumberlike roots cut from stalks of cattail ; and the delicious , jicamalike fruit of the yucca flower .
And he pointed out jimson weed , which can be made into a tea that causes psychedelic hallucinations ( though too large a dose is fatal ) .
Every plant we encountered , it seemed , could nourish us , kill us , or get us high .
Though most of the people on Nyerge 's walks seemed to be naturalists , there was one student who I thought might be a survivalist .
He appeared to be in his 20's , with long hair , a beard , and a sticker from the movie The Big Lebowski on his backpack
" So are you into a lot of the survivalism stuff ? " I asked .
He rankled at the question .
" I would n't say I 'm a survivalist .
I do n't believe in hoarding guns and that whole selfish us - against - them mentality . "
" I guess survivalism has that sort of stigma . "
He had principles .
I liked that .
" But I see it as just learning skills to get by in case the system breaks down . "
" Well . "
He paced ahead of me , suddenly breaking eye contact .
" I am worried about peak oil .
Very worried .
Because when the oil goes , everything else goes : transportation , food production , heating , our whole way of life .
People do n't realize how much oil goes into everything . "
" So are you learning these skills so you can survive after the crash ? "
" Sort of .
I have about a month and a half left in L.A .
Then I go to San Francisco to live in a commune sort of thing . "
" Is it all survivalists there ? "
He stopped , plucked a leaf of curly dock , and took a small bite from it .
It was a good source of iron and vitamin A , though I preferred eating it cooked .
A month ago , I probably would have thought curly dock was one of the Three Stooges .
" They 're not really survivalists , " he responded .
" It 's something called permaculture . "
" What 's permaculture ? "
" It 's about sharing with other people and learning to live in harmony with the land .
I guess it 's a little like survivalism , but with a sense of responsibility to nature and humanity . "
I liked that idea .
I 'd noticed that the way people prepare for TEOTWAWKI ( the doomsayer acronym for " the end of the world as we know it " ) has a lot to do with their view of human nature .
If you 're a Fliesian and think that without the rules of society to restrain them , some people will become violent animals and ruin it for everyone else , then you 're going to build a secret retreat , stockpile guns , and start a militia .
If you 're a humanist and believe people are essentially compassionate , then you 're going to create a commune , invite everyone , and try to work in harmony together .
I asked him where I could find the permaculturists , and he recommended checking out Quail Springs near Santa Barbara and the Regenerative Design Institute in Bolinas , near San Francisco .
I researched both when I returned home and noticed that where survivalists are essentially reactionary , making preparations and then waiting just in case the system breaks down , permaculturists did n't seem to be waiting .
They were already living off the grid .
" If you try to do it alone , you 'll most likely end up in Waco , " said Warren Brush , the first permaculturist I called the following day .
He was the founder of Quail Springs and , like many others in the movement , a former Tom Brown student .
" To best explain what we do , we 're not an eco-village .
We 're not a commune .
We 're a pioneer species trying to repattern human habitation in a way that will provide resources for generations to come . "
Brush went on to explain that many of the activities necessary to become self - sustaining were actually illegal , such as elements of rainwater harvesting , which he 's actually been fined for .
Evidently , the government owns the rain and , in Colorado for example , it 's illegal to take any of it .
So he 's been teaching how to get around some of the regulations .
" There 's this complacent bubble that 's about to pop , " Brush warned before hanging up .
" The clock is ticking faster every day . "
There is a group known as freegans .
They live off the waste of others .
Based in New York City , its members strive to disconnect from the economy and live almost entirely through what they call urban foraging — or , as it's more commonly known , dumpster diving .
If the permaculturists had their way , the freegans would be extinct .
Because the permaculture dream is to create a waste - free world , where everything is used to create life — even our own waste .
In the outhouse at the Commonweal Garden , a permaculture community operated in Bolinas by the Regenerative Design Institute , there are separate holes for urine and fecal matter .
A sign above them explains that the urine is composted in straw and then used in the garden for growing vegetables .
Meanwhile , the solid waste is dropped in a bin , where it is consumed by worms , whose droppings are used as a fertilizer for apple trees and strawberry patches .
That is what permaculturists mean by waste - free .
One man 's shit is another man 's food .
Here 's the modern environmentalist argument in sixty seconds : Since 1960 , the world population has doubled , which means three billion more mouths for the planet to feed .
To cater to all these needs , we 're plundering the ocean , the soil , the forests , and , especially , the fossilized remains of our predecessors on this planet to an unprecedented degree .
And by burning coal , oil , and gas , not to mention nuclear fission and all the waste products of our consumer society , we 're reducing — if not destroying — the earth 's potential to produce more of the resources that sustain us .
Supposedly , for every truckload of product most companies produce , they create 32 truckloads of waste .
And the environmentalists are not wrong .
But rather than complaining about this system , permaculturists are simply building another one , which does n't commit any of these environmental crimes .
It is a system that fulfills man 's basic need for a feeling of accomplishment , especially in creating and executing a perfect plan , especially when that plan involves your hands interacting with the land .
Outside one of the homes here , for example , there 's a shower .
The shower is fed by a rainwater catchment on the roof .
The runoff from the shower fills the pond , which supports the ducks .
The ducks eat the bugs off the strawberries in the garden , which are served for breakfast .
The leftover breakfast scraps are dropped into the bin of worms , which are used to feed the fish that maintain the balance in the pond .
And the worm 's waste , as we already know , is used to fertilize the strawberries .
It 's a perfect , closed , interdependent system .
Man 's greatest pleasure .
A microcosm of planet earth .
I met James Stark and his wife Penny , who run the Commonweal Garden , in a large yurt there .
Wearing black jeans , a carefully shaped grey goatee , and a thin black bolo tie , Stark did n't look like a back - to - nature type .
But he runs classes here on farming , bee keeping , and nature awareness , in addition to workshops on subjects like non-violent communication — a model of positive , compassionate , non-coercive , and non-judgmental social interaction developed by Marshall Rosenberg .
Stark said he was currently working on a project to create 10,000 edible gardens in communities , which " will be essential when the shortages start happening . "
He cited Cuba as a test run for this vision , explaining that when the country 's oil shortage reached a critical level in 1993 , the government tracked down permaculture consultants , who helped it make the transition into sustainable culture .
Ideally , he'd like the Regenerative Design Institute to be the Johnny Appleseed of the movement : continually training people , then sending them into the world to spread the word and nourish the land .
In the world of the future , he sees everyone growing apples and vegetables in their lawns , instead of carefully landscaped gardens that look pretty but nourish no one .
" It 's incredibly empowering when people realize they can feed themselves , and do n't need to be dependent on the corporations and Safeway and restaurants , " James said .
His particular enthusiasm may be traceable to his upbringing on a sheep and cattle farm in Eastern Canada that been in his family since 1839 .
But , unable to compete with modern industrialized agriculture , most of the farms in the community were sold during his lifetime , including the majority of his family farm .
Permaculture did n't start with Stark .
The term was coined in the 1970's by Bill Mollison and David Holmgren in Australia , who wrote extensively about creating self - sufficient agricultural systems that reflected the balance of nature .
Today , although this figure seems hard to believe , according to Warren Brush and others , there are 2.5 million practitioners of permaculture in 135 countries , who 've created some 850,000 projects .
As I left the yurt to wander around the garden , an instructor approached me .
He appeared to be in his forties , but had a boyish face and haircut .
" I heard you met Tom Brown , " he said .
I 'd trained in tracking and wilderness survival at Tracker School under the fearsome tutelage of Brown , the father of the modern nature - minded survivalist movement .
" Do you know him ? "
" I was actually Tom 's first student .
We met on a street corner thirty years ago . "
I stared at him , in shock for a moment .
This man-boy was Jon Young , whose voice I 'd been listening to for months on a cassette series he created , the Kamana Naturalist Training Program , and one of the people I 'd been looking for in my search for self - sufficiency mentors .
" I 've been doing your Kamana program ! " I sounded like a fan , a naturalist groupie .
" Do you have some time to talk ? "
Young said his house was two hours away , and he was preparing to move .
Though he may have meant those words as discouragement , I decided to take them as a yes and told him I 'd meet him there tomorrow to help him move .
After all , who 's going to turn down free labor .
It was very permaculture of me .
The next day , I drove across the Golden Gate Bridge , down the Pacific Coast Highway , and , at San Gregorio Beach , turned left into the forest .
Young 's directions were written with the eye of a naturalist , with instructions like , " Turn left at the hill covered with Monterey pine trees . "
I eventually arrived at a 41 - acre spread nestled in a riparian valley of oaks .
Young walked outside to greet me , and led me down a small incline to a grove of old - growth Redwoods , in the center of which stood an ancient stump with a hollowed - out center large enough to sit under .
He did n't say anything about helping him carry moving boxes , so I did n't remind him .
" Do you hear that ? "
Young asked as we sat in the dead leaves and pine needles .
The air was still and fragrant .
The ground was soft and giving .
The deciduous canopy arched over us like a cathedral , echoing with the sharp , high whirr of a bird call .
" That 's the sound a Steller 's jay makes when it 's warning the rest of the forest about a predatory bird , " he said .
" If it 's a Cooper 's hawk , we 'll know because the whole forest will go quiet for a good 100 yards if it 's hunting . "
I added learning bird calls to my survival to - do list .
At times , it seemed there would be no end to the amount of things I needed to catch up on .
To learn survival evidently meant to learn every essential skill that mankind had developed on its journey from homo habilis to civilized man .
Young said he first met Brown when they were teenagers , and bonded because they both felt the human race was destroying the planet .
When Young told his new friend he'd even contemplated suicide at one point , Brown responded , " Do n't kill your physical self .
That 's not the problem .
Kill your society self .
Go live in the woods .
And if things ever get really dark , you could always trade your life for a vision . "
Young went quiet after this story , and began listening intently to the environment .
" Do you hear that redtail hawk call ? " he asked .
" It means there 's a golden eagle nearby , so maybe we 'll get to see one . "
Like Tom Brown 's mastery of tracking , Young knew the language of the forest .
And I wanted him to teach me to be fluent .
To do this , he said , I needed to learn nature awareness instead of nature skills .
When I asked him the difference , he explained , " Unlike skills , awareness requires time and saturation . "
He stopped to listen to the forest again , then asked , " Do you hear that ? "
I listened for the sound of another bird , but all I could hear was a helicopter chopping the air overhead .
" That 's the sound of the new owner of my house checking out the property , " he said .
" He 's a billionaire named John Doerr , who bought a lot of acreage around here .
I 'm not too happy about having to leave .
I 've put a lot of work into this land . "
He looked up at the redwoods and oaks , which had started growing centuries before he 'd arrived here .
Evidently , some of the locals believe Doerr is trying to buy land and water resources to prepare for an ecological apocalypse .
" And so he 's kicking you out ? " I asked .
" Does n't he know that you would be his greatest ally if anything happened ? "
" I know .
I 've tried to reach him several times , but I 've never been able to get past his people .
There 's another billionaire who moved out here and is stocking up also . "
What 's up with all the billionaires , I wondered .
Did they have some sort of inside information that we did n't ?
Were they connected directly to God or the government or al Qaeda ?
Or were they just seeing the same signs in the world , the economy , and the environment that I was ?
When I tried to get in touch with Doerr afterward and check Young 's information , his receptionist gave me perhaps the most metaphysical rejection I 'd ever received .
He was , she said , unable to talk due to " the realities of time . "
Not one to let the spacetime continuum stand in my way , I found a speech Doerr made at the TED conference in Monterey , CA in 2007 , which began with the words , " I 'm really scared — I do n't think we 're going to make it , " went on to discuss potential global environmental catastrophes , and ended in tears .
So he was one of us .
As we sat comfortably under the canopy of leaves , unaware of passing time , Young told me of a Mohawk belief .
According to his explanation , when people are born , the creator hides a gift in them .
But they can't see their own gift , nor can their parents .
Instead , it 's the responsibility of others in the community to see that gift and help bring it out .
This is because that gift does n't belong to the person who possesses it .
It belongs to the community .
And that is permaculture .
It is about letting go of ego , selfishness , and possessiveness , and realizing your full potential by working in harmony with others and the earth instead of against them .
The peak - oil guy with the Big Lebowski sticker was right , I thought as I left Young 's house to visit a community farm nearby :
This is a more fulfilling way to survive than buying a shotgun , sitting on a box of MREs , and yelling " get off my land " at innocent passers - by .
It 's only in the movies where one man survives alone .
In the real world , survival is a team sport .

Amazon is almost certain to announce a large - screen Kindle on Wednesday .
In the world of e-book readers , that 's huge .
But if Apple fulfills expectations and releases a tablet - style computer later this year , it 's going to render the Kindle – no matter what screen size – almost instantly moot .
Amazon 's Kindle is far and away the most popular e-book reader ; Amazon probably sold half a million last year and may sell a million Kindle 2's this year .
Yet the Kindle 's 6 - inch screen , while impressively readable and crisp , is only slightly larger than a 3 " x 5 " index card .
That 's why many magazine and newspaper publishers are excited about the prospect of a larger Kindle — let 's call it the " Kindle XL . "
Even if it 's not as large as Plastic Logic 's promised 8.5 " x 11 " screen ( due in early 2010 ) , a larger screen would provide lots more room to display the day 's news , attractively laid - out feature stories , and , of course , advertisements .
Textbook publishers — who may be Amazon 's true target market , if the speculations of our own Charlie Sorrel as well as Om Malik are correct — may have even more to be happy about .
The $ 9.8 billion textbook market is a prime example of the slowness , stupidity and waste of paper publishing .
Plus , students would welcome the chance to ditch backbreaking tonnage and carry a thin , lightweight e-book reader instead .
Amortized over the four or five years of a typical college education , even a $ 500 or $ 600 reader would be a reasonable expense .
UPDATE 3:30 pm Pacific : According to the Wall Street Journal , six universities will be offering their students e-textbooks on the large - screen Kindle .
But all this pales in comparison with what an Apple tablet could do .
Rumors earlier this year suggested that Apple is working on a larger version of the iPhone with a 9 or 10 - inch touchscreen , rather than a tablet - style MacBook .
More recently , BusinessWeek cited anonymous sources suggesting that Apple and Verizon would soon release an iPhone - like " media pad " with a larger screen .
Imagine that the " media pad " includes a screen two to four times the size of the iPhone 's 3.5 - inch ( 2 " x 3 " ) screen , Wi-Fi connectivity , the ability to run software from the App Store and a full web browser .
The usefulness of a device like that would instantly trump that of any e-book reader , even if the battery life is poor and the screen less readable than an e-ink screen .
That 's because a simple , easy - to - use tablet would be able to do anything the e-book reader could ( display the text of books using an app like Stanza , which Amazon recently acquired ) plus it would have access to 40,000 apps and billions of web pages .
Its screen would be able to display color , and it would undoubtedly let you access e-mail , IM and other apps that people want .
By contrast , e-book readers are good at basically one thing : Storing and displaying monochrome text and simple graphics .
While the Kindle 2 has a web browser , it 's all but useless for even the most basic web activities .
Make no mistake :
There are many more people who would be interested in a general - purpose tablet than in an e-book reader .
Sure , the majority of them would probably use it to download bikini photos of Evangeline Lilly while watching Lost on the big screen instead of re-reading Proust .
But if the PC and smartphone industries are any guide , people will opt for a well - designed multipurpose device over a special - purpose gadget every time , even if the latter does a few things much better .
Already , there are more people reading e-books on the iPhone using Stanza alone ( more than one million ) than on the Kindle .
We do n't know whether Apple will release a tablet or not .
But if it does , its sales will make the Kindle 's million units look like a rounding error .

I always like to say that 90 % of Perl is its modules .
Back in 2000 when I was working as a junior Perl programmer I was asked to write a web application that , among other things , could send contact messages through email .
Unfortunately , I never had anyone to really teach me the Path of Perl – I only relied on Learning Perl by Randall Schwartz , and whatever I could find on the net .
I had a really hard time with that application , mainly because I did n’t know about Perl modules , MySQL and SQL language .
Had I been familiar with at least the Perl modules part , I would n’t have had to spend 8 days and nights in the office ( including my birthday ) .
I did n’t even know how to use strict ; at the time !
Keep reading if use strict ; makes no sense to you .
Being the extensible and flexible language that it is , Perl provides us with some safeguards and helpers to assist in avoiding what happened to me ( I wish I knew that back then ) .
The first of which I ’ll talk about is Pragmas .
Pragmas
Pragmas are special modules that come installed by default in every Perl distribution .
They tell the interpreter of how it is supposed to act .
To turn them on , all you have to do is call the special word use with the appropriate Pragma .
To turn them off , call no and the Pragma in question .
The most common and powerful Pragma is , in my opinion , strict ( hence the name of this blog : use strict ; ) .
Strict tells the Perl interpreter that all variables must be declared and tightens up security a notch .
To use strict ; you have to have at least working knowledge of lexical variables .
It takes a while to getting used to at first , but once you ’re hooked , you wo n’t know how you could possibly have written Perl programs without it before ( I know I do n’t ) .
#!/usr/bin/perl $var = 1 ; # OK use strict ; $ var1 = 2 ; # compile time error
example .pl
In our example above , Perl will refuse to run , raising a compile time error like such :
Global symbol “ $ var1 ” requires explicit package name at example .pl line 5 .
Execution of example .pl aborted due to compilation errors .
That ’s strict in effect .
Notice that $var was not cited , since strict was only enforced below it .
In order to bypass that error , we should have declared our variable with either my , our , or local – depending on the need .
my is the most common .
Look up “ Packages , Namespaces , and Lexical scopes ” for more on those 3 operators .
#!/usr/bin/perl $var = 1 ; # OK use strict ; my $ var1 = 2 ; # OK
use strict ; is so important that it is usually the second line of code in any decent Perl program – the first line being the shebang .
If you need to turn off strict for one reason or another , you can do so with the key word no .
#!/usr /bin/perl use strict ; my $ var = 1 ; # OK no strict ; $ var1 = 2 ; # also OK
When writing your Perl programs , it ’s also good to turn on warnings and diagnostics .
warnings will complain about possible problems such as useless uses of certain functions .
diagnostics , on the other hand , will throw you a truckload of information regarding errors .
It ’s a good place to start when you ’re stumped .
Perl Modules
Perl modules are pieces of code or packages that can be imported into your script with the keyword use in the same way as Pragmas .
They can be Object Oriented , Procedural , or both .
I will not discuss how to write a module in this post , but I will tell you where to find them for download and how to install them .
My all time favorite module is Data : : Dumper .
So I will use it in the following examples .
The funny :: between Data and Dumper is kind of like a directory separator .
The module Dumper resides in the directory Data , found in one of the paths configured in the Perl config files or the PERL5LIB environmental variable ( which set the @INC array ) .
Data :: Dumper comes installed by default , along with hundreds other modules that the developers deemed worthy .
To test that your Perl distro has it , run the following command in a command line :
$ perl - MData : : Dumper -e ' print " OK
" '
You ’ll most definitely see the OK being printed on your screen .
The command passes 2 parameters to the Perl interpreter : -M which tells it to load a module ( in this case Data : : Dumper – no spaces between -M and the module name , or you ’ll get a “ missing argument ” error ) , and -e which tells it to execute a piece of code ( we told it to print OK , but any valid piece of code would do ) .
Look at what would have happened if we tried to load a module that was n’t installed :
$ perl - Maaaa -e ' print " OK
" '
Ca n’t locate aaaa.pm in @INC ( @INC contains : /usr/lib/perl5/5.10/i686-cygwin
/usr/lib/perl5/5.10
/usr/lib perl5/site_perl/5.10/i686-cygwin
/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.10
/usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.10/i686-cygwin
/usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.10
/usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.10
/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8 /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8 . ) .
BEGIN failed –compilation aborted .
To install a module , you can do it the hard way or the easy way .
Some modules are harder than others , so I ’ll stick with the easier ones for now .
Let ’s start with the hard way .
First , you should know where to find your module .
CPAN – The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network is the place to go to get your modules .
It has a handy search engine which will search through almost 16000 modules at the time of this writing ( 5/2009 ) .
There you will find code ranging from the most trivial to the craziest needs .
If there ’s one thing that CPANs contributors do n’t lack , it ’s creativity ( that ’s a compliment ) .
Enter a keyword in the search engine and it will list all relative modules .
Click on the link to the one that interests you most .
You will be shown its documentation in POD ( Plain Old Documentation ) format .
That ’s the data you will most likely need to learn how to use your module .
It should also be the most up - to - date information , since it ’s kept by its authors .
At the top of the POD screen , you ’ll see a breadcrumb set of links showing the Author ’s name , the module ’s distribution name and version , and the module name itself :
Ilya Martynov > Data - Dumper - 2.121 >
Data:: Dumper
Click on the link for the module ’s distribution name and version , to go to the distribution details screen .
You will see lots of information about the module and its sub-modules , but what should concern you right now is the download link next to the release name .
Click on it and download the module tarball .
Now this is where I halt and tell you that potential headaches lie ahead .
There are basically 2 kinds of modules : PurePerl ones and C - based ones .
PurePerl modules are just that – modules that are solely written in Perl .
The vast majority of modules , however , are written in C with bindings special for Perl .
Those usually have to be compiled and as such , need a C/ C++ compiler and a make program .
The good news is that most * nix systems come with those tools already installed or readily available .
Windows systems , however , require that you install nmake and preferably Microsoft Visual C++.
Check out my post about installing MQSeries module on Windows for more information on how to get Microsoft Visual C++
Back to installing the module …
Unpack your module in some directory where you have full access .
I like to keep an untouched copy of the tarball , by reading the gunzipped contents and throwing it to the screen with the -c option , and piping it to tar with xvf - parameters :
gunzip - c tarball.tar.gz | tar - xvf -
You ’ll end up with a directory having the name of your distribution .
Go in there and read all README files you can find .
Read the INSTALL files if any .
One of the files you ’ll see in the directory is Makefile .
PL .
That ’s the kickoff file for the installation .
It takes the following optional parameters : PREFIX , LIB , and INC , and creates a makefile tailor made for your system .
It ’s important to set the PREFIX parameter if you want the module installed in a place other than the default .
LIB and INC point to the C lib and include directories , respectively .
Now that you have your makefile , it ’s just a matter of running make , make test , and finally make install .
Depending on the module , you should have no issues whatsoever .
Other more “ sensitive ” modules , however , often require hours of work and even some tweaking of the makefiles by hand .
DBD :: Oracle is by far the craziest module I ’ve ever had to install .
In some machines it ’s a piece of cake , and others it manages to amuse with the amount of errors it pulls out of the hat .
Anyway …
That was the hard way .
Now for the easy way .
CPAN
If you ’re finding it strange to see the CPAN title here when I ’ve already talked about it above , do n’t worry – I ’m talking about the application CPAN and not the website .
Perl comes with the CPAN module installed , and most of the time it also creates a script in the bin directory called cpan .
It ’s an interactive shell that allows you to fetch information regarding authors and modules , and also allows you to install modules without having to go through the whole process of downloading the distribution , unpacking , etc .
Start up the CPAN application by calling
$ perl - MCPAN -e shell
If it ’s the very first time you call it , you will be promped to answer a series of questions .
Sticking to the default values is almost always OK .
One of the first questions you will be asked is if you want CPAN to configure everything automatically .
I recommend against it unless you know that the defaults are correct and will enable you to successfully install modules .
And if you know that , then you probably already know how to use the CPAN application and this post has nothing new . 🙂
Once the questions have been answered , you will be presented with a cpan prompt .
Type ? to know what options you have .
cpan [ 1 ] > ?

Use o conf to display the parameters to which you answered all those questions .
You can change them with o conf as well .
If you did n’t enable auto - commit before , you will have to call o conf commit to save your changes for use in future sessions .
o conf http_proxy " http://some_proxy.com:80 "
The m command allows you to fetch information regarding a certain module .
cpan [ 2 ] > m Data :: Dumper ....
Possibly some data about fetching updated files from the internet here ....
Module id = Data:: Dumper DESCRIPTION

In the output above , CPAN tells us that we alreay have Data : : Dumper version 2.121_14 installed .
If you are not sure what is the exact name of a module , use the i command to fetch information using a regex :

( not installed )
Install it with install command .
cpan [ 5 ] install Lingua : : Klingon :: Collate
Now , unless you already have module Test : : Differences installed , Lingua : : Klingon :: Collate will fail with a dependency error .
Not all modules are like that .
Some are coded in a way that CPAN actually asks you if you want to follow and install dependencies automagically .
Those are a cinch to install .
If something goes wrong , look at the output of the installation .
Best case scenario , you ’re just missing another module and it did n’t warn you about it .
For example , after Lingua : : Klingon : : Collate failed with the warning that I should have Test : : Differences installed , I tried to install that dependency directly .
It also failed .
When looking at the output on the screen , I see a bunch of lines like this :
t /regression .......... Can't locate Text / Diff.pm in @INC ( @INC contains : /home / vi alves/.cpan/build/Test-Differences-0.4801-lI_xia/blib/lib

You ’ll notice that the error is the same as when we did the $ perl - Maaaa -e ' print " OK " ' .
Module Text / Diff.pm ( or namely Text : : Diff ) is not installed .
So we now go on that quest of following dependencies by hand .
It so happens that Test : : Differences tried to install Text : : Diff , but Text : : Diff failed during the test phase .
Suppose I know that those failed tests are not important and wo n’t hinder the results of the rest ( I do n’t , but bare with me ) , I can force CPAN to disregard the test failures :

Ok , that happens .
It ’s because of the previous bad attempt .
We can bypass that by telling CPAN to restart the build from scratch .
To do so , it must first clean the build environment for that module .
cpan [ 9 ] clean Lingua :: Klingon :: Collate
That usually does the trick and enables you to run the install again , but if it does n’t , you can force get Lingua : : Klingon : : Collate to get a fresh package .

The experience of growing up online will profoundly shape the workplace expectations of " Generation F " – the Facebook Generation .
At a minimum , they ’ll expect the social environment of work to reflect the social context of the Web , rather than as is currently the case , a mid-20th - century Weberian bureaucracy .
If your company hopes to attract the most creative and energetic members of Gen F , it will need to understand these Internet - derived expectations , and then reinvent its management practices accordingly .
Sure , it ’s a buyer ’s market for talent right now , but that wo n’t always be the case — and in the future , any company that lacks a vital core of Gen F employees will soon find itself stuck in the mud .
With that in mind , I compiled a list of 12 work - relevant characteristics of online life .
These are the post - bureaucratic realities that tomorrow ’s employees will use as yardsticks in determining whether your company is “ with it ” or “ past it . ”
In assembling this short list , I have n’t tried to catalog every salient feature of the Web ’s social milieu , only those that are most at odds with the legacy practices found in large companies .
1 . All ideas compete on an equal footing .
On the Web , every idea has the chance to gain a following — or not , and no one has the power to kill off a subversive idea or squelch an embarrassing debate .
Ideas gain traction based on their perceived merits , rather than on the political power of their sponsors .
2. Contribution counts for more than credentials .
When you post a video to YouTube , no one asks you if you went to film school .
When you write a blog , no one cares whether you have a journalism degree .
Position , title , and academic degrees — none of the usual status differentiators carry much weight online .
On the Web , what counts is not your resume , but what you can contribute .

The Daily Dozen feature on National Geographic , edited by photo editor Susan Welchman , is a treasure trove of neat " Your Shots " photos submitted by the magazine 's readers ( a selection of which will actually appear on the magazine itself - talk about awesome ! ) .
I particularly like this one , submitted by James Snyder who wrote :
This is a Cuban tree frog on a tree in my backyard in southern Florida .
How and why he ate this light is a mystery .
It should be noted that at the time I was taking this photo , I thought this frog was dead having cooked himself from the inside .
I 'm happy to say I was wrong .
After a few shots he adjusted his position .
So after I was finished shooting him , I pulled the light out of his mouth and he was fine .
Actually , I might be crazy but I do n't think he was very happy when I took his light away .

Technology.am ( May 9 , 2009 ) — About a year ago Mozilla first brought in Prism , and now they plan to release the first beta version of the web - to - desktop platform and take the wraps off Prim ’s shiny , new website .
The new updated version includes various new features , like tray icon and notification support , and application - specific settings such as fonts and proxies .
You can also choose a custom icon in the event that you ’d prefer something a little nicer looking that the site ’s favicon .
Prism is already in use in a number of web - to - desktop applications like Yahoo ’s Zimbra mail client .
Removing browser chrome elements provides a more traditional application feel their GMail inbox and helps cut down on inappropriate use .
To roll your own Prism apps , you ’ll need either the Firefox extension or the Prism application .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A record 32.2 million people -- one in every 10 Americans -- received food stamps at the latest count , the government said on Thursday , a reflection of the recession now in its 16th month .
Food stamps , the major U.S. anti-hunger program , help poor people buy groceries .
The average benefit was $ 112.82 per person in January .
The January figure marks the third time in five months that enrollment set a record .
“ A weakened economy means that many more individuals are turning to SNAP / Food Stamps , ” said the Food Research and Action Center , an anti-hunger group , using the acronym for the renamed food stamp program , the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program .
The U.S. unemployment rate was 8.1 percent in February , the highest in 25 years .
Weekly claims for jobless benefits totaled 669,000 last week , the highest in 26 years , the government said on Thursday .
Food stamp enrollment rose in 46 of the 50 states during January as the national total rose by 580,000 people , or 1.3 percent , from December , when the previous record was set , said Agriculture Department figures .
Vermont , Alaska and South Dakota had increases of more than 5 percent .
Texas had the largest enrollment , 2.984 million , down 65,000 , followed by California at 2.545 million , up 43,000 , and New York with 2.211 million , up 37,000 .
“ It is a very difficult time for low - income families and individuals and also a difficult time for the groups that serve them , ” said Valentine Breitbarth of Bread for the City , a group that works with poor families in Washington .
Food stamp benefits get a temporary 13 percent increase , beginning with this month , under the economic stimulus law signed by President Barack Obama .
The increase equals $ 80 a month for a household of four .
Recent food stamp data :
Month Enrollment
September 2008 31.587 million
October 2008 31.050 million
November 2008 31.097 million
December 2008 31.784 million
January 2009 32.205 million
" There were quite a few people around about twenty to thirty .
It was a really good surf .
The sun was shining the waves were clean and not too crowded .
Within white culture , your choice of transportation method says a lot about you .
For example a Prius says you care about the Earth , a bicycle shows you REALLY care about the earth , and a bus shows that you are probably not white .
But these three options are not the only viable ways for a white person to get around , they have literally dozens of choices including Volvos , old Mercedes that run on vegetable oil , Subaru Outbacks , and Vespa Scooters .
As it stands , every single white person on earth either owns , has owned , or is dreaming about owning a Vespa Scooter .
And why not ?
They are Italian , feature vintage design , low emissions , make the rider look more sophisticated , and they carry a little bit of risk .
In fact , were it to have a liberal arts degree and a steady income , a Vespa scooter would possesses every important quality that a white person looks for in a spouse .
In addition to these superficial qualities , there are some very practical benefits to white people .
Namely , scooters are perfect for gentrifying neighborhoods which are often short on parking and heavy on people who are impressed by Vespas .
If you are in search of a fun game , a white person who has recently purchased a Vespa can be a source of tremendous entertainment .
Step
One , get them talking about their Vespa ( easy ) .
Step
Two , start asking them why they did n’t save money by getting a Honda or Suzuki that gets the same mileage .
Step
Three , see how many of the following justifications a white person will use during the ensuing rant : environment , parking , urban lifestyles , union labor , writers , fuel efficiency , Roman Holiday , study abroad , and being into Vespas before other people .
Finally , the Vespa has produced one of the great paradoxes in white culture .
Vintage Vespas are infinitely cooler than newer ones , but the vintage models produce more pollution than most automobiles .
If you know a white person going through this dilemma , just say something like “ the amount of energy and carbon used to produce a new scooter will probably cancel out the emissions from your vintage one . ”
Problem solved forever .
Why has health - care reform stalled in Congress ?
Democrats , after all , control both Houses , and President Obama , whose popularity remains high , has made universal health care his No. 1 priority .
What 's more , an overwhelming majority of the public wants it .
In the most recent Wall Street Journal / NBC News poll , 76 % of respondents said it was important that Americans have a choice between a public and private health - insurance plan .
In last week 's New York Times / CBSNews poll , 85 % said they wanted major health - care reforms .
So why ...
Here ’s a classic litmus test for the sunk cost fallacy :
You bought a ticket for a show .
The night arrives and you just do n’t feel like going .
Do you go anyway , so as not to have wasted the money on the ticket ?
Probably you should n’t .
Your current decisions should not be influenced by money that is spent and unrecoverable .
There are , of course , some exceptions :
Going to the show lets you avoid some painful cognitive dissonance — though this one does n’t really accord with my notion of rationality .
Going to the show preserves your reputation for making prudent choices ( somewhat deceptively ) , and for following through on commitments .
Fair enough .
You might not remember what all persuaded you to buy the ticket but the more you spent the better reasons you must have had .
If you have a fixed budget for entertainment then the more you spent on the ticket the less you can afford alternative entertainment , increasing your value for the paid - for ticket .
But mostly those are rationalizations and , rationally , you should n’t go .
The last one in particular is dangerous — what you need to consider is how much money you have left , not how much you spent on the ticket .
The lesson here is :
Do n’t throw good money ( or effort / energy ) after bad .
Here ’s another classic litmus test for the sunk cost fallacy :
Scenario 1 : You bought a $ 10 non-refundable ticket to a show .
( And note that you definitely would not have done so if the show cost $ 20 . )
As you get to the theater you realize you lost your ticket .
Luckily , they have more available , still at $ 10 .
Do you buy another ticket ?
Scenario 2 : You did n’t buy a ticket ahead of time .
As you get to the theater you realize that $ 10 has fallen out of your pocket and is lost .
Luckily , you still have enough to buy a ticket .
Do you do so ?
Everyone agrees on Scenario 2 .
Of course you do .
No one ’s on such a tight budget that an unexpected change in wealth of $ 10 changes their utility for theater .
But many people refuse ( I ’ve checked ) to see that Scenario 1 is fully equivalent .
They ca n’t bear to pay another $ 10 for a show they already paid $ 10 for .
If Scenarios 1 and 2 do n’t feel fully equivalent , you ’re probably suffering from the sunk cost fallacy !
The lesson here is :
Do throw good money after bad .
The general lesson of the sunk cost fallacy is to not be influenced in either direction by money / effort that is spent and unrecoverable .
In examples like the case of no longer feeling like going to the show , I will ask myself “ would I go to see this show ( or whatever ) right now if it were free ? ” .
I ’ve actually seen people hyper - correct for the sunk cost fallacy .
They might blow off a hundred dollar ticket because , given their current preferences , they ’d only be willing to pay ten dollars for it !
The point is to make your decision now as if the cost had never happened , hence “ sunk cost ” .
Quiz
To make sure you ’re neither falling prey to the sunk cost fallacy nor hyper - correcting for it , here are some more sunk cost quiz questions .
Feel free to leave your answers in the comments .
( When I floated this quiz among friends , family , and colleagues , only 8 of 19 people got them all right .
Those wrong on more than one included fancypants PhDs . )
Scene :
You have a non-refundable flight but now the opportunity to road trip with some friends to your destination has come up .
Which of the following are rational and which are irrational :
“ I might do that much driving to save the flight costs but since the flight is paid for I ’d rather take it . ”
“ That flight was so expensive that I had to forgo another part of my vacation , so not using the flight is not really an option . ”
“ I ’m willing to blow off the flight if it was cheap enough . ”
“ I ’m going to drive because that ’s what I would ’ve done if I had considered the driving option in the first place ; what ’s happened since then is irrelevant . ”
“ I ’m going to fly because that ’s what I would ’ve done even if I had known about the driving option in the first place . ”
And the last one has no right answer but I ’ll throw it in anyway :
“ I need to use this flight otherwise I ’ll be forced to admit to myself how dumb I was to book it too soon . ”

Following the Asian tsunami , scientists struggled to explain reports that primitive aboriginal tribesmen had somehow sensed the impending danger in time to join wild animals in a life - saving flight to higher ground .
A new theory suggests that the anterior cingulate cortex , described by some scientists as part of the brain ’s “ oops ” center , may actually function as an early warning system — one that works at a subconscious level to help us recognize and avoid high - risk situations .
While some scientists discount the existence of a sixth sense for danger , new research from Washington University in St. Louis has identified a brain region that clearly acts as an early warning system — one that monitors environmental cues , weighs possible consequences and helps us adjust our behavior to avoid dangerous situations .
“ Our brains are better at picking up subtle warning signs than we previously thought , ” said Joshua Brown , Ph.D. , a research associate in psychology in Arts & Sciences and co-author of a study on these findings in the Feb. 18 issue of the journal Science .
The findings offer rigorous scientific evidence for a new way of conceptualizing the complex executive control processes taking place in and around the anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) , a brain area located near the top of the frontal lobes and along the walls that divide the left and right hemispheres .
“ In the past , we found activity in the ACC when people had to make a difficult decision among mutually exclusive options , or after they made a mistake , ” Brown said .
“ But now we find that this brain region can actually learn to recognize when you might make a mistake , even before a difficult decision has to be made .
So the ACC appears to act as an early warning system — it learns to warn us in advance when our behavior might lead to a negative outcome , so that we can be more careful and avoid making a mistake . ”
Implications for mental illness
The ACC has been the focus of intensive scientific research in recent years because it plays a critical role in the brain ’s processing of especially complex and challenging cognitive tasks .
Abnormalities in the region are closely associated with a host of serious mental problems , including schizophrenia and obsessive - compulsive disorder .
Researchers provided study participants with a series of blue or white cues and asked them to push one button or another depending on the direction of arrows .
Brain imaging suggested that an area of the brain had learned to recognize that blue cues indicated a greater potential for error , thus providing an early warning signal that negative consequences were likely to follow their behavior .
By providing a clearer picture of the cognitive mechanisms by which we self monitor and control our behavior , the study is an important step in efforts to develop more effective treatments for mental illness .
It also provides a new way of understanding inappropriate behaviors that often accompany mental illnesses .
“ Our results suggest how impairment of the ACC mechanisms in schizophrenia can lead to breakdowns in the early warning system , so that the brain fails to pre-empt or control inappropriate behavior , ” Brown said .
“ On the other hand , in individuals with obsessive - compulsive disorder , the ACC might warn of an impending problem even when no problem is imminent . ”
“ Interestingly , we also found evidence that the same neurotransmitter involved in drug addiction and Parkinson ’s disease , namely dopamine , seems to play a key role in training the ACC to recognize when to send the early warning signal , ” he added .
Known to be an important component of the brain ’s executive control system , the ACC is believed to help mediate between cold , hard , fact - based reasoning and emotional responses , such as love , fear or anticipation .
“ For a long time we ’ve been interested in how the brain figures out how to integrate cognitive information about the world with our emotions , how we feel about something , ” Brown said .
“ For many reasons , people think the ACC might be the brain structure responsible for converging these different signals .
It seems to be an area that ’s involved in deciding what information gets prioritized in the decision - making process .
It seems able to link motivational and affect information – things like goodness or badness – and to use this information to bring about changes in cognition , to alter how we think about things . ”
New paradigm for brain ’s “ oops ” region
While there is growing consensus about the important role played by the cingulate in complex thoughts and feelings , there are competing theories regarding the cognitive mechanisms that underlie activity there .
Recent studies have documented spikes of activity in the ACC just as people realize that they ’ve made a mistake of some kind , a sensation some describe as the “ oops ” moment ( or , in more informal terms , as the “ Oh S *** ” response ) .
Theories based on these findings suggest that the primary role of the ACC is to help detect and subsequently correct mistakes or , alternatively , to detect the state of high - conflict that often accompanies mistakes ”
Brown ’s study , co-authored with Todd Braver , Ph.D. , associate professor of psychology in Arts & Sciences , offers compelling evidence that the ACC is better understood as a pre-emptive early warning system , one that is actively working to help us anticipate the potential for mistakes and thus avoid them altogether .
“ We started with the premise that perhaps the cingulate was not responding to the detection of an error or state of conflict , but maybe instead what the cingulate is detecting is the likelihood of making an error , ” Brown said .
“ We wanted to see if the cingulate would become more active even in situations where no conflict is presented and no errors are made , but the potential for error is still higher than normal ”
Methodology
To test their hypothesis , Brown and Braver developed an experiment requiring healthy young people to respond to a series of cues on a computer screen .
Participants were presented with either a white or a blue dash , which soon changed into a small arrow pointing either right or left .
They were instructed to quickly push one of two buttons depending on the arrow ’s direction .
To simulate conflict , researchers occasionally slipped in a larger second arrow that required participants to change gears and push the opposite button .
“ The idea is that at some point you have these competing tendencies – to push the right or left button — and both are active in brain at same time , which creates conflict , ” explains Brown .
“ Some theories suggest that whenever you see these two arrows , then that drives this state of conflict and it ’s the state of conflict that is being detected by the cingulate . ”
By increasing the delay before presentation of the larger second arrow , researchers raised the odds that an individual would reach “ the point of no return ” and thus be unable to change gears in time to avoid pushing the wrong button .
They then adjusted the delay time over many trials so that each participant eventually exhibited error rates of about 50 percent when provided with an initial blue priming dash , compared with error rates of only 4 percent when presented with a white priming dash .
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , researchers captured images of brain activity at 2.5 - second intervals throughout the experiment .
“ We did n’t tell them that the white or blue cue offered any clue about their likelihood of making an error on any particular trial , but by the end of the session , some of them had begun to figure it out , at least on a subconscious level , ” Brown said .
Even among those who remained relatively unaware of the blue cue ’s significance , researchers found that simply showing the blue color was eventually enough to spark increased activity in the cingulate , and that this effect strengthened over time as the subject became more familiar with the task .
Thus , brain imaging confirmed that the ACC had “ learned ” the significance of the blue cue , and had begun , at least subconsciously , to adjust behaviors accordingly , the study found .
“ It appears that this area of the brain is somehow figuring out things without you necessarily having to be consciously aware of it , ” Brown said .
“ It makes sense that this mechanism exists because there are plenty of situations in our everyday lives that require the brain to monitor subtle changes in our environment and adjust our behavior , even in cases where we may not be necessarily aware of the conditions that prompted the adjustment .
In some cases , the brain ’s ability to monitor subtle environmental changes and make adjustments may actually be even more robust if it takes place on a subconscious level . ”
Computer model of brain spurs new discoveries
In addition to its findings , the study is significant within scientific circles because of its use of sophisticated computer models to accurately predict the patterns of brain activation that would be sparked by the experiment , patterns only later confirmed by the imaging data from actual real - world trials .
“ We started by building a detailed computer simulation of the ACC , and then we found that the computer predicted the existence of the early warning signal in ACC , ” Brown said .
“ This was an exciting result , but we still needed to test the prediction in humans to demonstrate that the model prediction was correct . ”
The researchers also tested their theory using another computer model that had been previously developed to support an existing theory of the ACC as a system focused on conflict resolution .
“ By simulating both models we could then adjudicate between them and do so in a way where we forced each one to make predictions that we only tested after the fact , ” Brown said .
“ By integrating the theory , the computational simulation and then the fMRI testing , we are providing other scientists with some very rigorous evidence that our new theory is accurate . ”
During the last two decades , as computers have become much more powerful , computer modeling has become an increasingly powerful tool for understanding the brain , said Brown , noting that findings from this study offer a nice example of how computer models of the brain can lead to new discoveries .
“ In fact , our computer model also makes some other exciting predictions about how the ACC works , but we have n’t had an opportunity to test them yet , ” Brown said .
“ We ’ve got our work cut out for us . ”
From Washington University in St. Louis
In a rescue operation that sounds straight out of an action film , 50 mountain chicken frogs were airlifted from the Caribbean island Montserrat after the discovery of Chytridomycosis , a fungal disease that has wiped out amphibian populations worldwide .
Already , hundreds of the critically - endangered mountain chicken frogs succumbed to the disease , which is thought to have made its way to the island in late 2008 or early 2009 .
A partnership of the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust ( DWCT ) , the Zoological Society of London ( ZSL ) and Parken Zoo in Stockholm , Sweden , split the frogs into three groups with each institution receiving a batch .
A team from DWCT worked with the Department of Forestry in Montserrat to survey the conditions of the frog populations after the disease was discovered .
Seeing the gravity of the situation , a decision was made to evacuate as many healthy frogs as possible .
Only one population of mountains chickens on the island appears to remain disease - free , although biologists believe it ’s only a matter of time before the disease reaches the last population .
“ I remember being surrounded by calling frogs in Montserrat and the effect of the sound echoing off the sides of the valleys was magical , ” says DWCT ’s Head of Herpetology , Gerardo García .
“ It has been very sad to return to these valleys and see them either empty or full of dead and dying frogs .
The one positive aspect was that we were able to get to the main population in a place called Fairy Walk before the disease , and now these animals form the basis of our rescue efforts ” .
The frogs were sent to institutions that already have experience working with them .
As one of the world ’s largest frogs , they have matching appetites and are known for being difficult to keep in captivity .
“ As we see from elsewhere in the world , chytrid has spread to Montserrat with devastating effect , ” says Quentin Bloxam , DWCT ’s Director of Conservation Management .
“ We now have a strong collaboration between institutions that are well placed to lead this effort .
The captive populations form a crucial part in protecting this species from extinction . ”
Considered one of the world ’s rarest amphibians ( listed as number 158 on EDGE ’s amphibian list , which lists species regarding their threat - level and genetic distinction ) , the mountain chicken frog used to be abundant on six Caribbean islands .
A number of factors , including invasive species like rats and hunting for food by locals , have led to its extinction on all the islands but Dominica and Montserrat .
The mountain chicken frogs on Dominica were devastated by chytridmycosis in 2002 .
With the disease entering Montserrat the best chance for these frogs may be in institutions like ZSL , Parken Zoo , and DWCT .
“ Our captive breeding unit means that we are now in a great position to support the Mountain chicken frogs from Montserrat at a time when their home is rife of this deadly disease , ” says Ian Stephen , ZSL ’s Assistant Curator of Herpetology .
“ This ex-situ rescue population gives genuine hope for the future survival of this species . ”

Just how competent is Sarah Palin ?
She has n’t been able to juggle everything to date … and now a new “ ball ” is up in the air .
Harper Collins just signed the Governor of Alaska to a book deal .
In a time tight budgets and economic chaos , they managed to find a great sum to trade for the memoirs of a girl from Wasilla , Alaska .
The book is due next spring .
It was reported she was getting an $ 11 million advance .
She denied the amount .
It flies in the face of having a legal defense fund .
That ’s fantastic !
Great !
Get a laptop and a bottle of Adderall … you ’ll be fine .
If you get stuck …well , make it up .
It ’s worked so far .
The governor said about her new book , “ There have been so many things written and said through mainstream media that have not been accurate , and it will be nice through an unfiltered forum to get to speak truthfully about who we are and what we stand for and what Alaska is all about . ”
Who is “ WE ? ” How in the ham and cheese can Sarah Palin know what “ Alaska is all about ? ”
No one can sum this place up ; that ’s what I love about it .
We are too mavericky to have one voice define us .
Palin added , “ The idea is to focus on the content of the book and what ’s coming in terms of me being able to tell my story unrestrained and unfiltered . ”
Well , that ’s precious !
The idea of being governor , traveling around , and making promises for votes , is to FOCUS on the State you were elected to represent .
“ It will be nice to put my journalism degree to work on this and get to tell my story , Alaska ’s story .
There have been so many unauthorized books and publications that have spoken to somebody else ’s opinion of who I am , what my family represents and what Alaska is all about . ”
AGAIN , SARAH , what 41.6 % of Alaskans , according to last weeks poll numbers , think Alaska represents , is NOT YOU .
Tell your family story , your story , but not ours .
For all the reasons it took her three weeks to sign a bill to support the emergency funding for the Alaska Territorial Guard , Sarah sure found her pen today .
But there is a problem .
Remember all the ethics Palin was touting during her un -holy national tour on the Strait Jacket Express ?
They include specific statutes :
S 39.52.170 . Outside Employment Restricted .
( a) A public employee may not render services to benefit a personal or financial interest or engage in or accept employment outside the agency which the employee serves , if the outside employment or service is incompatible or in conflict with the proper discharge of official duties .
( c) The head of a principal executive department of the state may not accept employment for compensation outside the agency that the executive head serves .
Rest easy , I ’m not going to file an ethics complaint over this .
The system has been wildly abused , including the one Sarah filed on herself .
Ethics are not something you can legislate ; either you have them or you do n’t .
Alaska has a citizen legislature .
They are expected to have employment outside of the 90 day session .
The governor and her cabinet are considered full time employees .
I ’m not an attorney , but , after reading the details of the statutes , they seem specific and unambiguous ; the governor ca n’t be paid for other employment .
Sarah Palin is living the dream .
People want to read about it .
Some Alaskans are living a nightmare , and she needs to do her job .
Since the governor ’s return to Alaska , not much has progressed .
Our legislature could n’t even pass the bestiality bill dubbed “ Ididadog . ” Groundhog Day is now Marmot Day .
We have a new state dog .
Our minimum wage wo n’t be the lowest in the nation .
Sarah ’s pet projects crashed in committee .
Her AG and cabinet appointments were rejected by the Republican majority legislature .
Some of that I ’m good with , I do n’t want the uterus police in my business or a bigot as Attorney General .
Palin has n’t been able to perform her duties as governor without a book deal .
What ever she writes , Rush Limbaugh will consider it a pop-up book .
Now that she has a contract , it wo n’t take an ethics board to figure out Alaskans lose again .
Any guesses for a title ?
The following was published in the January 2009 issue of Game Developer magazine …
Most game developers are familiar with Sid ’s dictum that “ a good game is a series of interesting choices . ”
In fact , my co-columnist Damion Schubert started his recent article on player choice ( October 2008 ) by referencing this famous quote .
However , over the course of his career , Sid has developed a few other general rules of game design , which I heard him discuss many times during my seven years ( 2000 - 2007 ) at his studio , Firaxis Games .
As these insights are quite practical lessons for designers , they are also worthy of discussion .
Double it or Cut it by Half
Good games can rarely be created in a vacuum , which is why many designers advocate an iterative design process , during which a simple prototype of the game is built very early and then iterated on repeatedly until the game becomes a shippable product .
Sid called this process “ finding the fun , ” and the probability of success is often directly related to the number of times a team can turn the crank on the loop of developing an idea , play - testing the results , and then adjusting based on feedback .
As the number of times a team can go through this cycle is finite , developers should not waste time with small changes .
Instead , when making gameplay adjustments , developers should aim for significant changes that will provoke a tangible response .
If a unit seems too weak , do n’t lower its cost by 5 % ; instead , double its strength .
If players feel overwhelmed by too many upgrades , try removing half of them .
In the original Civilization , the gameplay kept slowing down to a painful crawl , which Sid solved by shrinking the map in half .
The point is not that the new values are likely to be correct – the goal is to stake out more design territory with each successive iteration .
Imagine the design space of a new game to be an undiscovered world .
The designers may have a vague notion of what exists beyond the horizon , but without experimentation and testing , these assumptions remain purely theoretically .
Thus , each radical change opens up a new piece of land for the team to consider before settling down for the final product .
One Good Game is Better than Two Great Ones
Sid liked to call this one the “ Covert Action Rule , ” a reference to a not - altogether - successful spy game he made in the early ’90s :
The mistake I made was actually having two games competing with each other .
There was an action game where you break into a building and do all sorts of picking up clues and things like that , and then there was the story which involved a plot where you had to figure out who the mastermind was and what cities they were in , and it was an involved mystery - type plot .
Individually , each part could have been a good game .
Together , they fought with each other .
You would have this mystery that you were trying to solve , then you would be facing this action sequence , and you ’d do this cool action thing , and you ’d get out of the building , and you ’d say , “ What was the mystery I was trying to solve ? ”
Covert Action integrated a story and action poorly because the action was actually too intense – you ’d spend ten minutes or so of real time in a mission , and by the time you got out , you had no idea of what was going on in the world .
In other words , even though both sections of the game were fun on their own , their co-existence ruined the experience because the player could not focus her attention on one or the other .
This rule points to a larger issue , which is that all design choices only have value in relation to one another , each coming with their own set of cost / benefit trade - offs .
Choosing to make a strategic game also means choosing not to make a tactical one .
Thus , an idea may be “ fun ” on its own but still not make the game better if it distracts the player from the target experience .
Indeed , this rule is clearly the reason why the Civ franchise has never dabbled with in - depth , tactical battles every time combat occurs .
However , sometimes multiple games can co-exist in harmony with each other .
Sid ’s own Pirates !
is an example of a successful game built out of a collection of fighting , sailing , and dancing mini -games .
However , these experiences were always very short – a few minutes at the most – leaving the primary focus on the meta - game of role - playing a pirate .
Each short challenge was a tiny step along a more important larger path , of plundering all Spanish cities or rescuing your long - lost relatives .
Another example of a successful mix of separate sub - games is X - Com , which combined a tactical , turn - based , squad - level combat game with a strategic , real - time , resource - management game .
As with Pirates ! , what makes X - Com work is that the game chose a focus – in this case , the compelling tactical battles between your marines and the invading aliens .
The high - level , strategic meta - game exists only to provide a loose framework in which these battles – which could take as long as a half hour each – actually matter .
One does n’t fight the aliens to get to manage resources later ; instead , one manages resources to get to perform better – and have more fun – in future battles .
Do your Research after the Game is Done
Many of the most successful games of all time – SimCity , Grand Theft Auto , Civilization , Rollercoaster Tycoon , The Sims – have real - world themes , which broadens their potential audience by building the gameplay around concepts familiar to everyone .
However , creating a game about a real topic can lead to a natural but dangerous tendency to cram the product full of bits of trivia and obscure knowledge to show off the amount of research the designer has done .
This tendency spoils the very reason why real - world themes are so valuable – that players come to the game with all the knowledge they already need .
Everybody knows that gunpowder is good for a strong military , that police stations reduce crime , and that carjacking is very illegal .
As Sid puts it , “ the player should n’t have to read the same books the designer has read in order to be able to play . ”
Games still have great potential to educate , just not in the ways that many educators expect .
While designers should still be careful not to include anything factually incorrect , the value of an interactive experience is the interplay of simple concepts , not the inclusion of numerous facts and figures .
Many remember that the world ’s earliest civilizations sprang up along river valleys – the Nile , the Tigris / Euphrates , the Indus – but nothing gets that concept across as effectively as a few simple rules in Civilization governing which tiles produce the most food during the early stages of agriculture .
Furthermore , once the core work is done , research can be a very valuable way to flesh out a game ’s depth , perhaps with historical scenarios , flavor text , or graphical details .
Just remember that learning a new game is an intimidating experience , so do n’t throw away the advantages of an approachable topic by expecting the player to already know all the details when the game starts .
The Player Should Have the Fun , not the Designer or the Computer
Creating story - based games can be an intoxicating experience for designers , many of whom go overboard with turgid back stories full of proper nouns , rarely - used consonants , and apostrophes .
Furthermore , games based on complex , detailed simulations can be especially opaque if the mysterious inner workings of the algorithmic model remain hidden from view .
As Sid liked to say , with these games , either the designer or the computer was the one having the fun , not the player .
For example , during the development of Civilization 4 , we experimented with government types that gave significant productivity bonuses but also took away the player ’s ability to pick which technologies were researched , what buildings were constructed , and which units were trained , relying instead on a hidden , internal model to simulate what the county ’s people would choose on their own .
The algorithms were , of course , very fun to construct and interesting to discuss outside of the game .
The players , however , felt left behind – the computer was having all the fun – so we cut the feature .
Further , games require not just meaningful choices but also meaningful communication to feel right .
Giving players decisions that have consequence but which they cannot understand is no fun .
Role - playing games commonly fail at making this connection , such as when players are required to choose classes or skills when “ rolling ” a character before experiencing even a few seconds of genuine gameplay .
How are players supposed to decide between being a Barbarian , a Fighter , or a Paladin before understanding how combat actually works and how each attribute performs in practice ?
Choice is only interesting when it is both impactful and informed .
Thus , in Sid ’s words , the player must “ always be the star . ”
As designers , we need to be the player ’s greatest advocate during a game ’s development , always considering carefully how design decisions affect both the player ’s agency in the world and his understanding of the underlying mechanics .

The City ’s New Black Media Makers : MLK Would Have Wanted to be on YouTube
The video grabs your attention immediately .
Young people in the Lower Ninth Ward hold up signs that read : “ looter , ” “ we ’re still here , ” and “ America did this . ”
Amid empty lots and damaged houses , poet Nik Richard delivers this message : “ Hurricane Katrina was the biggest national disaster to hit American soil , and nearly two years later , this area is still devastated .
But you know what ?
We made sure we preserved it strictly for your tourism .
For about $ 75 , you can take one of these many tour buses . ”
Tourists drive by and people with cameras gawk .
Richard looks directly at the camera and says , “ It looks like there ’s more money to be paid in devastation than regeneration .
If y’all keep paying your money to see it , should we rebuild it ? ”
The short film New Orleans For Sale , which has garnered several awards , was made by 2 - Cent Entertainment , a group of young Black media makers in New Orleans .
The group , which currently has 10 members , made New Orleans for Sale to convey the frustration felt by many New Orleanians as the city has become a national spectacle and a backdrop for countless national politicians , while the aid the city needs to rebuild still has n’t arrived .
In 2008 , the film won several awards including an NAACP image award in a competition , called Film Your Issue , which featured a high - powered jury with the likes of news anchor Tom Brokaw and media executives from MTV Networks , Lionsgate Entertainment and USA Today .
Working at the intersection of art and justice , as well as entertainment and enlightenment , 2 - Cent has attracted a wide and growing audience .
In New Orleans , they ’ve also collaborated with the People ’s Hurricane Relief Fund , produced shows on local television and radio stations , and created mix CDs and scores of short videos .
Beyond creating inspiring programming , 2 - Cent members also seek to pass their skills onto the next generation , and have taught and presented their work and in New Orleans high schools and colleges .
“ Huey Newton said the young people always inherit the revolution , ” says Brandan “ B - Mike ” Odums , 2 - Cent ’s founder .
“ And that ’s what 2 - Cent is , it ’s how our generation responded to that call . ”
Positive Images
The collective formed in 2004 , when Odums gathered a group of friends ( most of them fellow students at the University of New Orleans ) to produce a TV show with a message .
“ A lot of TV promotes a monolithic way of thinking , saying there ’s only one way to be , or promoting ignorance as cool , ” says Odums .
“ We say it ’s hot to stand up for yourself and speak for yourself . ”
The group was still newly formed when Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans , and in the aftermath of the storm , with 2 - Cent members spread across the United States , they nearly disbanded .
“ Katrina made us realize that this is what we want to do , ” says Odums .
“ We ’d done two episodes before the storm .
Everybody was scattered .
We had to decide if this is something we really want to do .
Katrina forced us to make the decision . ”
The collective briefly relocated together to Atlanta , then made the decision together to return to New Orleans .
Kevin Griffin , another of the founding members of 2 - Cent , joined because he shares Odum ’s desire to change the images and messages delivered to today ’s youth .
“ We were seeing the images that BET and others were putting out , ” Griffin says .
“ And we wanted to do something different , more positive . ”
Griffin is not just a media activist ; he is also one of the leaders of a citywide movement spearheaded by the Juvenile Justice Project of Louisiana , an organization whose mission is to close the Youth Studies Center , the city ’s youth prison .
The group has led campaigns to shut down other youth prisons around the state including the notorious youth prison in Tallulah , Louisiana , and they are also working to create more options for young people beyond jail .
For Griffin , these struggles have personal meaning .
“ At the age of 10 , I was sent to the Youth Studies Center , ” Griffin explains .
“ A year later I was moved to Tallulah , which was known as the worst youth prison in the country .
I was 11 .
The next youngest person was 17 , so I was a child among adults .
And I was there for five years . ”
When he was released , Griffin was determined to turn his experience into something positive .
“ I could have stayed on that path that was laid out for me , ” says Griffin .
“ But I did n’t want to become that . ”
He credits his family for helping support him when he got out .
Griffin now works full - time at WBOK , a Black - owned talk radio station ( their slogan is “ Talk back , talk Black ” ) .
Art also runs in his family .
His cousin Mannie Fresh , the music impresario of New Orleans ’ Cash Money record label , produced much of the music that made New Orleans hip hop famous .
Humor and Style
2 - Cent videos are notable for both humor and great production values .
“ We liked a lot of the messages you would see on Public Access TV , ” explains Griffin .
“ But we wanted to make something with better production . ”
This combination of form and content , and a mix of serious and comic , defines the 2 - Cent style .
“ We take education and comedy and we mix it all together , ” says collective member Manda B , who writes and acts in many of the group ’s videos .
“ We can trick people into learning .
We built it off a foundation of edutainment .
Even with our most crazy and bizarre scripts , we have a meaning . ”
The group seems to have limitless energy and ideas , and they bring new angles to their subjects , finding humor in unexpected places , and bringing ideas to young people by using that humor .
Their piece on Jena , Louisiana , is filmed at the September 20 , 2007 protests in Jena , when tens of thousands of young people converged in what was called the birth of the 21st century civil rights movement .
But the 2 - Cent video intercuts with one of their members — an effortlessly humorous young performer named Stiggidy Steve — wandering confused on Jena Street in New Orleans and wondering where everyone is .
“ Older folks may try to put out similar ideas , ” says Manda B . “ But it ’s like they ’re preaching .
I think we know how to connect with our generation . ”
These young media activists praise Gil Scott Heron , who said the revolution will not be televised , but for 2 - Cent , media is a tool to be taken and used for the mission of social change .
“ Other generations marched , and we march too , ” says Odums .
“ But in this age we have a whole new range of weapons , and we ’re trying to use those weapons .
I think Martin Luther King , Jr. would want to be on YouTube , to have his speeches distributed that way .
Malcolm X would love to make mixtapes , have those out on the streets .
The same reasons they boycotted and had protests in that era are our reasons too .
We ’re coming from that same mindset , but we ’re using new tools , trying to get our inheritance . ”
After nearly five years together , the group has survived Katrina and all the connected stresses of living in New Orleans during this time , and their bonds become stronger and closer .
When asked what aspect of their work they were most proud of , various 2 - Cent members expressed the same sentiment as Manda B , who explained , “ For me , the best element of all this is that we ’re family . ”
For a large collective , 2 - Cent seems to have no problem working together , creating new content every week , and continually expanding the range of work they do and the audiences they reach .
“ We ’re all together like family , ” says Griffin .
“ And we ca n’t imagine not staying together . ”
NEW YORK ( April 2 , 2009 ) —
Getting your teenager to drink a chocolate milkshake is n’t something most parents need to worry about .
But this is just the approach used in one treatment for anorexia nervosa .
Known as Behavioral Family Therapy , or the Maudsley Approach , parents are called up on to supervise the eating habits of their anorexic child , feeding them high - calorie meals like milkshakes and macaroni and cheese until they regain a healthy weight .
For the first time , the Maudsley Approach is being compared with a more established treatment known as Family Systems Therapy as part of an ongoing National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) - funded treatment study at NewYork - Presbyterian Hospital / Westchester Division and five other centers nationally .
Both are outpatient therapies for adolescents , aged 12 to 18 .
“ Anorexia is a life - threatening condition .
Treating it early is very important since it is during the teenage years that this disorder usually takes hold , ” says Dr. Katherine Halmi , founder of the Eating Disorders Program at NewYork - Presbyterian Hospital / Westchester Division and professor of psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medical College .
“ Traditionally , patients with anorexia have been treated in a hospital setting or through one - on - one outpatient therapy .
While inpatient treatment is still appropriate in acute cases , we have increasingly seen the value of family - oriented outpatient therapy for adolescents . ”
The current study is designed to compare two different therapeutic approaches that involve the family — one is a behavioral therapy initially focused on weight gain , and the other examines various underlying issues in the family dynamic .
In the Maudsley Approach , named after the hospital in London where it was developed in the 1980s , the anorexic teenager attends therapy sessions together with their parents and siblings .
Parents work with the Maudsley therapist to develop ways in which they can monitor their child ’s intake , choosing the amounts and types of foods necessary for them to regain to a healthy weight .
Siblings are encouraged to act as a support system for their sister or brother .
Once patients achieve a healthy weight , they graduate toward taking more responsibility for their intake .
At this point , family and developmental issues relevant to the patient maintaining a healthy weight are addressed .
In Family Systems Therapy , families also attend regular therapy sessions , but discussions do not necessarily focus on eating .
Instead , family members are free to broadly explore and challenge any problematic communication patterns or stressors within the family unit .
“ In Maudsley , food is medicine that restores the body and mind .
When the body is starving , the mind also weakens , becoming more susceptible to anorexia ’s rigid , often obsessive logic .
Supervised feeding helps to break this vicious cycle .
With the anorexia in charge , the adolescent really cannot regain the weight on his or her own .
Nutritional rehabilitation gives the brain the nutrition it needs to re-establish healthy eating habits , ” says Dr. Dara Bellace , a clinical psychologist at NewYork - Presbyterian Hospital / Westchester Division and an instructor of psychology in psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medical College .
“ This approach does not blame parents , but rather calls on their ability to nurse their child back to health .
It requires a strong commitment to be with them for every meal — something that can mean rearranging schedules and taking a tag - team approach to sharing the responsibility , ” adds Dr. Bellace .
“ The adolescent must also dedicate themselves to the therapy , understanding that , until they regain the weight , their parents will be feeding them much as they did when they were younger , deciding what and how much they eat and making sure they finish . ”
Previous research has shown the Maudsley Approach successfully prevented hospitalization and helped adolescents recover their normal weights , with at least 75 percent of patients maintaining their recovery after five years .
A total of 240 adolescents aged 12 to 18 are being recruited for the study at six centers : NewYork - Presbyterian / Westchester ; Stanford University in Palo Alto , Calif . ; Sheppard Pratt in Baltimore , Md. ; University of California at San Diego ; University of Toronto ; and Washington University in St. Louis .
Those eligible must be medically stable individuals ages 12 to 18 with a body weight between 75 percent and 87 percent of its healthy range .
Families are randomized to receive either the Maudsley Approach or Family Systems Therapy .
In each family treatment , they attend 16 one - hour sessions over the course of nine months .
Sessions are held weekly for the first seven to eight weeks , bimonthly for the next six sessions , and monthly for the remaining sessions .
Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by extreme low body weight and body image distortion with an obsessive fear of gaining weight .
The condition largely affects adolescent females , who make up more than 40 percent of all cases .
As much as 3 percent of American girls and women are anorexic .
Contributing causes may include genetics , personality type , hormones , stress and societal pressures .
Anorexia carries the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric condition .
Previous research by Dr. Halmi found that 7 percent of affected women died within 10 years .
In a Swedish study that followed patients for 30 years , 18 percent to 20 percent of the women died .
Even when anorexia is not fatal , it can cause long - term complications , including damage to the heart and bones .
A new generation of Republican leadership ?
" As a group , we have been self - centered , self - absorbed , self - indulgent , and all too often just plain selfish . " ...
Daniels went on to offer a sweeping indictment of his own generation 's financial and moral selfishness , concluding : " It 's been a blast ; good luck cleaning up after us . "
The GOP is so desperate for a fresh new face -- especially with patience for Newt Gingrich , Rush Limbaugh and Dick Cheney , the party 's top spokesmen , growing extremely thin -- that they 'll take almost .
Earlier today Chris Cillizza put forward dull party operative Mitch Daniels , a former Eli Lilly corporate hack , who managed to overcome the handicap of having best arrested and jailed for drug use ( just pot ) , went on to become the spectacularly failed OMB director for Bush and is currently the Governor of Indiana , famous as a state producing particularly undistinguished governors from both sides of the aisle ( apart from territorial Whig governor William Henry Harrison , appointed by President John Adams ) .
Cillizza , a long time Daniels booster , was smitten with Daniels ' condemnation of Baby Boomers recently .
It was a thinly - vieled -- he makes a gratuitous attack on Obama as a way of showing his right - wing bona fides to Limbaugh -- condemnation of the Bush Regime , which he was part of , and of the Republican Party .
Keep lookin' .
Yesterday Roland reminded me when the California Republican Party had settled on low - grade hustler ( and thug ) , Mike Carona , dubbed by the Republican - owned media " America 's Sheriff , " as the future of the party .
He would be Arnold Schwarzenegger 's political heir .
And as Republicans became less and less happy with Schwarzenegger -- and then all but wrote him out of the party entirely -- they could n't wait for Carona to take over .
Indicted on federal corruption charges and convicted for witness tampering , he is currently serving five and a half years in prison .
Earlier Republican wunderkind Ted Bundy was seen as a rising star in the GOP .
His political mentor , 3 - time Governor and one - term U.S. Senator Dan Evans ( R - WA ) , frequent also - ran in the Republican vice - presidential sweeps , appointed him to the Seattle Crime Prevention Advisory Committee .
At the time he was a habitual petty thief .
In 1973 he moved up and became assistant to Ross Davis , chairman of the Washington State Republican Party .
A year later young women started disappearing wherever Bundy was -- Washington , Oregon , Utah , Colorado , Florida -- and after years in prison the once rising star of the GOP was electrocuted early in 1989 , as a huge nonpartisan crowd outside the prison cheered .
More recently , it looked like Joe the Plumber would be the salvation of the GOP -- until he quit the party in disgust -- only to be followed by a Miss America runner - up and sore loser , Carrie Prejean , who tickled the GOP 's fancy by embarking on a career of gay - bashing - for - Jesus .
It was then discovered she had lied about having been a soft core porn model and is no longer participating in any Miss California events .
With RNC Chair Michael Steele disqualifying Mitt Romney as too flippy - floppy and too Mormon for Republicans and with Dick Cheney writing the most popular Republican in the country , Colin Powell , out of the party , the GOP is desperate to find an acceptable leader .
And desperation has led to ... Gary Sinise ?
Who ?
Do n't ask me ; I do n't get out much .
I just know of a smarmy , wormy - looking actor named Gary Sinise who had a part inand then played George Wallace on TV , but they could n't mean him .
Could they ?
Maybe it's a plot to make Sarah Palin look good .

VIDEO games get a bad press .
Many are unquestionably violent and , as has been the way with new media from novels to comic books to television , they have been accused of corrupting the moral fabric of youth .
Nor are such accusations without merit .
There is a body of research suggesting that violent games can lead to aggressive thoughts , if not to violence itself .
But not all games are shoot - 'em-ups , and what is less examined is whether those that reward more constructive behaviour also have lingering impacts .
That , however , is starting to change .
Two studies showing that video games have a bright side as well as a dark one have been carried out recently .
One , to be published in June by the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology , was conducted by Douglas Gentile , of Iowa State University 's media research laboratory .
He and his colleagues tested the effects of playing so - called “ pro-social ” games on children and young adults in three countries .
A group of 161 American students played one of six games for 20 minutes .
Some were given “ Ty2 ” or “ Crash Twinsanity ” , both of which involve cartoonish fighting and destruction .
Others were assigned “ Chibi - Robo ! ” , which involves helping characters in the game by doing their chores , or “ Super Mario Sunshine ” , in which players clean up pollution and graffiti .
A third group , acting as a control , played “ Pure Pinball ” or “ Super Monkey Ball Deluxe ” , both of which involve guiding a ball through mazes .
Their games over , the participants were asked to choose 11 of 30 easy , medium or hard shape - based puzzles for a partner to complete , and told that their partner would receive a $ 10 gift voucher if he could complete ten of them .
Those who had been playing pro-social games were significantly more likely to help their partner by selecting easy puzzles .
The opposite was true for those assigned violent games .
The other parts of Dr Gentile 's study looked at established behaviour .
In one , a group of 680 Singaporeans aged 12 - 14 were asked to list their three favourite games and state the number of hours they played .
They were then given questionnaires , the answers to which suggested that those who spent the longest playing games which involved helping others were most likely to help , share , co-operate and empathise with others .
They also had lower scores in tests for hostile thoughts and the acceptance of violence as normal .
In the second , Japanese aged 10 - 17 were asked how much time they spent playing games in which the main character helps others .
When questioned three to four months later , those who played these types of games the most were also rated as more helpful to those around them in real life .
Screened for virtue
These two , later , parts of Dr Gentile 's study might , of course , just be proving that nice people prefer pro-social games .
But a second controlled experiment , by Tobias Greitemeyer of the University of Sussex , in England , and Silvia Osswald of Ludwig - Maximilian University , in Munich , confirms the gist of Dr Gentile 's conclusions .
In this piece of research ( to be published later this year , also in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology ) , Dr Greitemeyer and Dr Osswald asked 46 German students to play one of two classic games .
In the pro-social one , “ Lemmings ” , the aim is to protect rodents from various dangers .
By contrast “ Tetris ” acted as a neutral control .
In this game players rotate falling shapes so that they slot neatly together instead of saving self - destructive furry animals .
Playtime over , the students were asked to say what happens next in three incomplete stories involving a driver and a cyclist who narrowly miss colliding ; two friends , one of whom is unapologetic despite being repeatedly late ; and a diner speaking to a restaurant manager after waiting for an hour to be served and then having food spilt on him .
Those who had played “ Lemmings ” suggested endings in which the characters in the stories exhibited significantly fewer aggressive thoughts , responses and actions than the ones suggested by the “ Tetris ” players .
The upshot of both studies is that video games are like any other medium .
Feed the user with aggressive thoughts and you risk making him aggressive .
Feed him with the milk of human kindness and the opposite will probably happen .
No great surprise , perhaps .
But a salutary reminder both that the older generation should not rush to judgment on youthful habits it does not understand , and that the medium is not always the message .
On Monday , in posting some of the data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ’s Society at a Glance report , I noted that the French spent the most time per day eating , but had one of the lowest obesity rates among developed nations .
Coincidence ?
Maybe , maybe not .
Here I ’ve plotted out the relationship between time the average person in a given country spends eating and that country ’s obesity rate ( as measured by the percentage of the national population with a body mass index higher than 30 ) .

There does seem to be some correlation ( although , as we all know , correlation is not causation ) .
And note , of course , where America lies on this chart .
The mainstream Mormon faith had a collective freak - out this week over HBO 's plans to show a sacred Mormon temple ceremony on Sunday 's episode of " Big Love . "
However , church members say , viewers hoping to glimpse strange religious rites will be disappointed .
The temple ceremony is sacred , members say , but there 's nothing particularly freaky about it .
Since 2006 , " Big Love " has portrayed a fictional family of Utah polygamists , part of a religious group that split from the mainstream Mormon Church in 1890 when the church outlawed its practice of polygamy .
" Big Love " has always made Mormons squirm as it shares with Americans a piece of church history that members would rather not discuss .
Also , the show often confuses the public into thinking mainstream Mormons are polygamists , which they are not .
But this is the first time the show 's revealing ways have taken on sacred tenets of the mainstream Mormon faith , the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints .
" I am in shock that this is happening , " says Patti Hull of Gilbert , a Mormon for all 60 of her years .
" When you hold something sacred and people violate that , it 's very disconcerting . "
" Big Love " plans to show the Endowment Ceremony , one of many rites that take place within Mormon temples .
During the ceremony , Mormons watch a video portraying the fall of Adam , make promises to obey church teachings and wear special clothing that they switch from side to side on their bodies .
Only members of the Mormon Church " in good standing " are allowed inside , and most do not enter until they reach adulthood .
Inside the temples , Mormons also promise not to discuss what happens within .
However , when compared with the ceremonies of world religions in general , the temple rites will not seem strange , says Mormon Carmen Shelley , 50 , of Gilbert .
" People will be greatly disappointed when this show airs , " Shelley says .
" These are pretty ordinary ceremonies that occur in every other faith . "
However , Shelley says , " we hold ( the ceremonies ) sacred , " and the public often mistakes this as secretive behavior .
" People seem to think there 's something weird there because we do n't discuss it openly , " she says .
This week , while photos of " Big Love " actress Jeanne Tripplehorn wearing Mormon temple clothing circulated on the Internet , Mormons passed around furious e-mails calling for a boycott of the show and even America Online , which is owned by Time Warner , HBO 's parent company .
The church issued a statement urging members to calm down , reminding them that such behavior would draw only more attention to " Big Love . "
HBO representatives apologized in advance to Mormons who might be offended , saying the series ' creators " took great pains to depict the ceremony with the dignity and reverence it is due , " even consulting former church members .
The details of the Mormon temple ceremonies are also available on the Internet .
Mainstream Mormons hope that " Big Love " producers wo n't latch onto the sacred rites of Mormonism as a permanent plotline or a way to boost ratings .
" The reason ( the episode ) is so upsetting to me it that it's not done in the right spirit , " says Shelley , who plans to watch the episode to see if the writers got the ceremony right .
" It 's not done to educate or enlighten but merely to entertain and to ridicule . "

German Chancellor Angela Merkel , in a rare public rebuke of central banks , suggested the European Central Bank and its counterparts in the U.S. and Britain have gone too far in fighting the financial crisis and may be laying the groundwork for another financial blowup .
" I view with great skepticism the powers of the Fed , for example , and also how , within Europe , the Bank of England has carved out its own small line , " Ms. Merkel said in a speech in Berlin .
" We must return together to an independent central - bank policy and to a policy of reason , otherwise we will be in exactly the same situation in 10 years ' time . "
( Read excerpts of the speech . )
Ms. Merkel also said the ECB " bowed somewhat to international pressure " when it said last month it plans to buy € 60 billion ( $ 85 billion ) in corporate bonds -- a move that is modest in comparison to asset - buying by its counterparts , the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England .
Details are to be unveiled by the ECB 's president , Jean - Claude Trichet , Thursday .
The public criticism is unusual -- and not only because German politicians rarely talk harshly about central banks in public .
When politicians around the world do criticize their central banks , they almost always gripe that they are too tightfisted .
The conservative German leader 's comments came as Europe 's statistical agency reported that unemployment in the 16 countries that share the euro rose to 9.2 % in April -- the highest level since September 1999 and still below the 11.5 % that the European Commission forecasts for 2010 .
However , the economic straits of countries within the euro zone vary widely .
Germany 's unemployment rate of 7.7 % , for instance , contrasts with 18.8 % in Spain , where a collapse in the construction industry that was driving the economy has pushed unemployment to the highest in the euro zone .
It is n't clear what triggered Ms. Merkel 's remarks , which came in a prepared speech .
The ECB has been markedly less aggressive than the Fed or the Bank of England , particularly in moving beyond cuts in short - term interest rates to buy bonds to boost economic activity .
However , German officials traditionally have been on the more conservative end of the central bankers ' spectrum , partly because the country 's hyperinflation of the 1920s is seared into people 's memories .

The ECB , the Fed and the Bank of England are increasingly vulnerable to criticism because they have played such a prominent role and crossed so many traditional lines in the past several months -- even though they do appear to have steered their economies away from a repeat of the Great Depression .
Neither the ECB , the Fed nor the Bank of England had any comment on Ms. Merkel 's remarks .
Her tough comments about the extent to which the central banks are intervening in the economy also come amid attacks on her by some in her conservative base for putting € 1.5 billion of taxpayer money into a deal to shield Opel from parent company General Motors Corp .'s bankruptcy - protection filing .
Ms. Merkel 's critique jibes with statements from Axel Weber , the head of Germany 's central bank and a member of the ECB 's 22 - person Governing Council .
He has warned that too - loose monetary policy could fuel future inflation .
Mr. Weber was among the body 's most vocal skeptics on asset purchases before the bond - buying program , reservations that were also shared by Jürgen Stark , another German on the ECB council .
In a May 12 speech , Mr. Weber warned that overly generous monetary policy had helped build asset - price bubbles in the past .
In contrast , Athanasios Orphanides , the former Fed economist who now heads the Cypriot central bank , has been a vocal proponent of aggressive ECB policy .
And many private - sector economists contend the ECB 's response to the global recession has been too cautious .
The ECB cut its key rate to a record low of 1 % in May .
Mr. Trichet has n't ruled out further cuts , but most economists expect the central bank to stand pat Thursday and foresee the rate remaining at 1 % for the rest of this year .
The Fed cut its analogous rate nearly to zero in December and has said it will keep it there for some time .
Although the administration of President Barack Obama has carefully avoided criticizing the Fed , Republicans and Democrats in Congress have questioned the wisdom of the Fed 's power and its governance as they contemplate far - reaching changes to the nation 's financial regulatory structure .
The senior Republican on the Senate Banking Committee , Richard Shelby of Alabama , recently asserted that " an inherent web of conflicts is built into the DNA of the Fed as it now exists , " a reference to commercial bankers ' role in overseeing the Fed 's 12 regional banks .
Some private economists -- and a few inside the Fed -- say the Fed 's aggressiveness is increasing the risks of an outbreak of inflation and creating the unwelcome perception that it will bail out big financial institutions when they take big risks that turn out badly .

The European Central Bank plans to buy € 60 billion ( $ 85 billion ) in corporate bonds .
The caption in an earlier version of this article incorrectly gave the amount as $ 485 billion .
Sixteen people banned from entering the UK were " named and shamed " by the Home Office today .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said she decided to make public the names of 16 people banned since October so others could better understand what sort of behaviour Britain was not prepared to tolerate .
The list includes hate preachers , anti-gay protesters and a far - right US talk show host .

" I think it 's important that people understand the sorts of values and sorts of standards that we have here , the fact that it 's a privilege to come and the sort of things that mean you wo n't be welcome in this country , " Ms Smith told GMTV .
" Coming to this country is a privilege .
If you can't live by the rules that we live by , the standards and the values that we live by , we should exclude you from this country and , what 's more , now we will make public those people that we have excluded .
" We are publishing the names of 16 of those that we have excluded since October .
We are telling people who they are and why it is we do n't want them in this country . "
She said the number of people excluded from Britain had risen from an average of two a month to five a month since October .
The list of the 16 " least wanted " includes radio talk show host Michael Savage , real name Michael Weiner .
" This is someone who has fallen into the category of fomenting hatred , of such extreme views and expressing them in such a way that it is actually likely to cause inter-community tension or even violence if that person were allowed into the country , " Ms Smith told BBC Breakfast .
Also named are American Baptist pastor Fred Waldron Phelps Snr and his daughter Shirley Phelps - Roper , who have picketed the funerals of Aids victims and claimed the deaths of US soldiers are a punishment for US tolerance of homosexuality .
" If people have so clearly overstepped the mark in terms of the way not just that they are talking but the sort of attitudes that they are expressing to the extent that we think that this is likely to cause or have the potential to cause violence or inter-community tension in this country , then actually I think the right thing is not to let them into the country in the first place .
Not to open the stable door then try to close it later , " Ms Smith said .
" It 's a privilege to come to this country .
There are certain behaviours that mean you forfeit that privilege . "

Hamas MP Yunis Al - Astal , Jewish extremist Mike Guzovsky , former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard Stephen Donald Black and neo -Nazi Erich Gliebe are also on the list released today .
Artur Ryno and Pavel Skachevsky , the former leaders of a violent Russian skinhead gang which committed 20 racially motivated murders , are also banned from coming to Britain .
Both are currently in prison .
Making up the rest of the 16 named by the Home Office today are preachers Wadgy Abd El Hamied Mohamed Ghoneim , Abdullah Qadri Al Ahdal , Safwat Hijazi and Amir Siddique , Muslim activist Abdul Ali Musa ( previously Clarence Reams ) , murderer and Hezbollah terrorist Samir Al Quntar and Kashmiri terror group leader Nasr Javed .
WASHINGTON --
A handful of senators introduced a tax - policy change Tuesday that they say would encourage charitable foundations to increase their giving .
Democratic Sens. Charles Schumer of New York and Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan introduced a bill that would put a single tax rate on foundations ' investment income .
Current policy puts different tax rates on the investment income based on how much money foundations distribute to charity over periods of time .

Ever wonder what the home offices of the Internet ’s biggest bloggers look like ?
Need ideas for your own home office ?
Well , Shanker Bakshi dot Com has posted some pics showing the offices and work stations of over a dozen A - List bloggers .
Wonder how offices of these top shot bloggers look like ?
Well in my quest to become a successful blogger I always think about it .
Most of the Tech Geek Bloggers uses their laptop for blogging purpose but most of the top bloggers have their very own blogging headquarters , a very fine decked fully loaded and equipped office .
I always wanted to have a workplace like this .
I ’m giving here pictures of offices of my favorite bloggers for your delight .
Hope you would like it .
My office currently consist of a MacBook Pro and MacBook Air , two PCs , one media PC , one 30 ″ LCD , two 20 ″ LCDs and one 50 ″ plasma screen .
I ’ll most likely be adding a Mac Pro with three 24 ″ LED displays next .
As fancy as that sound , it still does n’t quite compare to this .
Check out the offices of the Internet ’s top bloggers .
The UK could save 10 m tonnes of carbon dioxide every year if the waste heat from some of the country 's biggest power stations was diverted to warm homes and offices , according to a study by engineers .
They say attaching heat capture technology to stations such as Kingsnorth and Drax would meet 5 % of the UK 's heat requirements .
And in future , any new big power stations should be built to capture and distribute heat as well as electricity .
In addition , new housing developments should be designed and built with small local combined heat and power ( CHP ) plants .
Heat accounts for around 49 % of all primary energy needs in the UK .
This is mainly fuelled by gas – in 2006 , the heat sector used 735 TWh compared with 653TWh and 393TWh used by transport and electricity sector respectively .
Currently , coal and nuclear power stations are around 35 % efficient which means that , for every 1,000MW of electricity the stations produce , around 2,000 MW of heat is dumped into the atmosphere via the cooling towers .
Theoretically , if half of that energy could be captured for domestic or commercial heating , it could meet 25 % of the UK 's current heat demand , according to a new study by researchers at the University of Southampton and the Institution of Civil Engineers ( ICE ) .
The study acknowledged that attaching CHP equipment to all of the UK 's power plants and then building the piping infrastructure needed to distribute it would not be practical for all the current power stations .
One practical problem is that many nuclear and coal stations are built in remote locations , far away from places that could usefully need their heat .
But the report did identify some power stations that are near to population centres : the region around Drax , Ferrybridge and Eggsborough near Leeds and the Kingsnorth and Tillbury power stations near London .
The installation of heat recovery schemes in these power stations could meet 5 % of the UK 's demand for heat and cut CO2 emissions by 10 m tonnes .
Keith Tovey of the Institution of Civil Engineers ' energy panel said that , although installing CHP would make a power plant produce less electricity , because it would produce useful heat , its fuel efficiency could more than double from 35 % to around 80 % .
Speaking at the launch of the report , Tovey said : " What we need to do is look closely at introducing district heating networks in areas surrounding viable existing power stations in the UK and ensure we assess potential heat capture possibilities for any new facilities . "
District heating networks would replace the need for boilers in homes and offices .
Residents would use whatever heat they needed from the mains and it could be metered in the same way that electricity is now .
Dr Patrick James of Southampton University said that such scheme would remove the need for householders to pay upwards of £ 2,000 for gas boilers , along with the associated servicing and repair costs .
Dr Doug Parr , chief scientist at Greenpeace UK , said : " We 're pleased to see the growing recognition that our inefficient , centralised electricity grid is losing over half of its energy in waste heat .
At a time when profligate energy use is threatening our survival , this makes less sense than ever . "
" However , once the problem has been recognised , we need to be more ambitious than just shaving a few per cent off the waste with bolt - on additions to a badly designed system – we need a decentralised grid where the power stations are sited in the correct places to make efficient use of the fuel they burn , not a continuation of the current model with some small token improvements .
CHP should be at the heart of our planning , not an afterthought . "
Tovey said that , in the longer term , the UK should consider the potentially huge benefits that decentralised CHP could bring to the UK .
" With the current generation of thermal power stations coming to the end of their lifespan , there is a real opportunity to vastly improve the efficiency of our energy sector and drastically lower its carbon footprint . "
According to the ICE report , the most efficient method for using heat is a decentralised CHP and district heating network , of the kind routinely found in Scandinavia and other parts of Europe , where small power stations are located close to the centre of population .
In addition the engineers encouraged places such as hospitals and universities to use small CHP stations for their energy needs .
Tovey acknowledged that delivering the kind of decentralised CHP across the UK that the ICE report recommended would require significant new infrastructure and a large reorganisation of the sector .
" But if we are to guarantee security of supply , whilst meeting tough carbon targets , radical change may be what is needed . "

The format , as explained in a welcoming letter I received from the agency , seemed simple enough : you attend a dinner for three couples at a fancy restaurant ; if you click with someone , you were free to arrange additional dates on your own , or by matchmaking through the agency .
The members of the group seated at the table with me had been selected by the agency for compatibility : fortyish , well - to - do professionals all , and each of us divorced at least once .
As luck would have it , the third man in the group had failed to show up , so distributed around the table with me were the other man , three women ( all reasonably attractive specimens in my eyes ) , and a facilitator , whose role was to keep the conversation moving along amongst the group .
“ Remember , honesty isimportant ! ” she chirped , managing to sound both serious and merry at the same time .
“ I encourage you all to consider it a , and not to embroider the ! ”
I did n’t really want to be here to begin with – this being exactly the type of contrived social event I loathe – so being lectured to in this way was particularly irritating .
I swirled a watery vodka and tonic and wondered why I had agreed to be here at all .
Having finished her lecture , the facilitator announced that everyone would be introducing themselves and giving a short biographical sketch , and gestured to me to begin .
I gave everyone sixty seconds of whom I am , and then took inventory of my companions as they did the same .
Teresa , who was sitting closest to me , was smartly dressed in a black skirt and a white blazer .
She smiled coyly beneath wavy blond hair and watery blue eyes , and her florid complexion suggested that she liked to pull a cork now and then .
Janet sat stiffly between Teresa and the facilitator .
The cream turtleneck that rose out from her dark jacket fit her like a neck brace , and her expression gave me the feeling that she considered this get - together to be very serious business .
Hunched over to the right of the facilitator was the other man .
He was already working on his second drink , and I had the urge to lean across the table and loosen the knot in his tie .
He stammered his way through a short introduction and then looked to his right .
Slouched there , at the other end of the group , was Kaitlin , who was as relaxed as Janet was not .
She seemed intelligent enough when she spoke , but somewhat lacking in self - confidence .
The most casually dressed member of the group , and wore a minimum amount of makeup .
Her peasant dress was simple and elegant ; her chestnut - brown hair short and shapeless .
With the introductions completed , the facilitator asked if everyone was ready to order and waved at the waiter passing through the room .
Kaitlin , I observed , ordered vegetarian .
But it would hardly have mattered if she ordered the filet mignon and lobster platter ; in the time - honoured feminine tradition of trying to make a good first impression on the first date , none of the women did more than pick at their food .
The conversation sputtered a few times in the beginning , but gradually took hold .
Terrorism , the economy , the housing market … all the predictable topics were discussed in a predictably superficial , non-offensive manner .
Unfortunately , the other man was not proving to be much of a conversationalist , and the burden fell to me to pick up the slack .
Twice I deflected questions about my opinions on social topics , and twice the facilitator cheerily reminded me that honesty was very important , and that I should consider it a rule .
The vodka I had consumed wanted to know if I was going to continue to put up with that shit , and I decided that I would not .
“ Look , just because I do n’t take you into my thoughts on every point we discuss does n’t mean that I ’m being less than honest .
” For a brief moment , the facilitator seemed nonplussed .
Clearly , she was not accustomed to having her concept of honesty brought into question .
Then the cheery smile she ’d been sporting throughout the evening found its way back onto her face , and she smoothed it into place with a short laugh .
“ But Dan , we ’re all trying to learn about each other tonight so that we can get acquainted .
We ca n’t do that if you ’re holding back things about yourself .
We want to know the Dan .
Wo n’t you help us with that ?
” I turned my palms toward the ceiling .
“ You ’re talking about candor – or transparency if you prefer – which is not the same as honesty .
Honesty is telling the truth about the things you choose to say , while providing enough detail to be representative of reality . ”
But the facilitator had decided to be preoccupied with trying to flag down a waiter , and she did not reply to this .
I looked around the table , hoping that someone would argue with me , or agree with me , or tell me to take a flying leap – anything , in short , to escape the perfunctory conversation we ’d been having for the past hour .
The waiter arrived and began clearing the table and taking drink orders .
Teresa turned towards me and rested her hand on the back of her neck , leaning forward to pivot her elbow on the table .
“ So , Dan , ” she said , smiling broadly , “ When was your last long - term relationship ? ” I decided that I ’d had enough of watery vodka and tonics and ordered a Remy Martin instead .
“ A couple of years ago or so . ”
I wondered when we would start to discuss the weather , and whether I could escape to the men ’s room after finishing the Remy for a leisurely , lengthily interlude , fake an upset stomach upon my return , and leave early .
“ How did you meet her ? ” Teresa had taken a liking to me , or so it seemed to me .
Knowing the forsaken path ahead of us in this line of conversation , I paused and thought for a moment .
So I shrugged , looked Teresa in the eye , and gave her honesty .
“ I picked her up at a strip club .
She was a dancer .
” Teresa laughed heartily .
“ Really ! ” she exclaimed a bit too loudly , and chuckled again .
“ Really , ” I replied quietly , not laughing or smiling .
Teresa fingered her drink , apparently trying to think of what to say next .
“ How long did you go out ? ” she finally asked .
“ A little over a year .
Maybe fifteen months .
” “ Why did you break up , because she was a stripper ? ” Teresa had stopped laughing and now looked slightly concerned .
Some of the other people at the table had stopped talking and were leaning in , trying to hear the conversation .
“ No .
She wanted to get married , and I did n't .
” “ Oh , ” said Teresa in a small voice .
The waiter had come back , and she traded him her empty glass for a full one .
A slice of pineapple hung from the rim .
“ You did n’t want to marry a stripper ? ” “ No , stripping had nothing to do with it . ” I took my Remy from the waiter and nodded a thank you .
“ Did n't it bother you ?
I buried my nose in the snifter containing the Remy and inhaled deeply .
My nostrils tingled .
“ Stripping ?
No . ” “ Do n't strippers also accept money for sex ?
” The other man at the table was watching me now , and for the first time since the evening began , he seemed to be enjoying himself .
I lowered my glass and swirled the cognac around .
“ You ’re confusing stripping with hooking , ” I replied .
“ Same difference , ” Teresa said evenly .
Her lips had begun to tighten and disappear .
I shrugged again and took a healthy swig from the snifter .
“ Do you go to strip clubs often ? ” Teresa ’s voice had sharpened , and she seemed much less interested in me now .
I puffed air from my mouth , feeling the Remy slide down to my stomach and igniting the flesh along the way .
“ How many times a week is often ? ” Teresa ’s mouth flapped open and closed a couple of times , and then she raised her own glass and sipped furiously at the straws .
Janet turned in my direction .
“ What is the attraction with strippers ? ” she asked stiffly .
I could see the facilitator trying to look at me around the curve of Janet ’s turtleneck sweater .
I looked back at Janet and said , “ They generally have little problem with getting naked .
” “ Do you pay them for sex ? ” I raised my glass and took another large sip .
“ Sometimes .
Sometimes not .
Depends on the girl , the day , the mood .
” One of Teresa ’s hands held her glass in the air , and the other was buried in her armpit .
“ Do you also see hookers ? ” she asked with sarcastic joviality .
I returned my gaze to Teresa .
Her cheeks were much redder now .
“ Street girls , no .
Escorts , yes .
” “ Why ? ” asked Janet with feeling .
“ Convenience , honesty , reliability .
And they go home afterwards .
” By now everyone at the table had stopped talking and was listening to us .
The facilitator gave me a furious look , then turned to the other man and asked him a question , but everyone ignored her .
I looked at the women one by one as I spoke .
“ Please do n’t take this the wrong way , but have any of you ever engaged in physical activity with the idea that you would be compensated somehow , even if the compensation was not explicitly stated ?
” “ Define compensation . ” Kaitlin sat up and joined the conversation .
“ A place to spend the night , a ride , cash , a gift , a promotion , a plum work assignment .
” “ By those definitions , yes .
I slept with a partner once to get ahead .
I was young , stupid , and it did not work .
But yes , just the once . ”
I noticed that Kaitlin was drinking a pinkish concoction and that her glass was more than half full .
Teresa and Janet traded glances and remained silent .
Janet took a long pull on her drink and set it back on the table .
She folded her arms over her chest and looked over at me .
“ Convenience , reliability , and leaving afterwards I can comprehend .
But you also said that you see hookers because of honesty .
What did you mean by that ?
Obviously not that she is ‘ transparent ’ about herself , since you are seeing all you wish to see of her already .
” I looked in my glass at the last of the Remy .
“ I ’m attracted to her physically , and that is what I want , a physical experience .
She wants the cash .
I know it .
So we work out an agreeable price and enjoy each other .
Then it is over .
Besides , it costs not much more than dinner and a show .
” At this last , Teresa and Janet collectively made a noise somewhere between a groan and a yelp , rolled their eyes , and sat back in their seats , both of them now with their arms crossed over their chests .
The other man was looking around for the waiter , and spotting him , made a tracing motion with his finger to order another round .
Kaitlin had pulled the straws out of her drink and was trying to fit the tip of one into the end of the other .
“ Have you ever slept with someone and promised them a promotion or a raise ? ” she asked , not looking up .
“ Never , ” I replied , shaking my head for emphasis even though I knew she would n’t see it .
Kaitlin pivoted in her seat to face the other man .
“ So , haveever paid for sex ? ” she demanded .
“ Uhm .
Ahh . ”
The other man turned red and began to look around for the waiter .
“ Well .
S -s - sort of , ” he finally stammered .
“ Are all men like this ? ” Teresa exploded .
“ Are n't there any decent men left ?
My ex used to get massages .
It was a long time until I figured out why .
” I put my palms on the table and spread my fingers out over the tablecloth .
“ You asked a question , I answered honestly . ”
The waiter had returned with a tray full of drinks .
“ Now it ’s your turn .
Did you ever cheat on your husband ?
Be honest , now . ”
The facilitator looked sharply at me , her face ashen .
“ Never , ” Teresa said with more than a trace of smug superiority .
“ Never kissed another man ? ” “ Of course , but that is not cheating .
” The waiter hesitated slightly , and then continued to distribute the drinks .
He put the tray down , and slowly and carefully began to collect the old glasses and wipe the table .
“ Did you ever kiss another man with intent ? ” “ ’ Intent ’ ?
What do you mean , ‘ intent ’ ?
” I downed the last of my Remy and handed the empty glass to the waiter .
“ Intent to excite physical passion .
” Teresa hesitated .
“ I ’m … I ’m not sure .
” “ Has another man ever touched you in a sexual manner , not intercourse , just in a sexual manner ? ” “ I did not do anything like that . ”
Teresa had found her footing again .
“ Never ?
I find it hard to believe that you have never been confronted with a sexual situation outside of your primary relationship .
” The facilitator tried to speak again , stopped , and buried her head in her hands .
Janet , who had been in the middle of another sip of her drink , hummed an assent as she swallowed .
“ I faced that once .
We were all but naked .
Except I could not go through with it .
I stopped , and fortunately , he accepted the situation with good grace .
” The waiter had run out of things to do at the table , and seemed to be idly flipping through his notebook .
I paused and looked at him , and he self - consciously collected his tray and wandered away .
I turned back to Janet .
“ Did you ever discuss this with your Significant Other ? ” “ No . I could n't .
” “ Why did you stop ? ” I glanced over at Kaitlin , who was still fiddling with the straws .
“ I do n't know .
I wanted it very much .
But I could not go through with it .
I just could not take the last step .
I was actually crying with frustration . ”
Janet shook her head at the memory .
“ I think that is why my friend took it so well , because of the crying , that is .
” “ I had an affair . ” Kaitlin had come back to life , and everyone looked at her .
“ My ex was having one .
I was lonely .
I missed sex , and I missed feeling good after sex even more .
It was fun in the beginning , but it quickly became just another chore .
I think it lasted all of three weeks .
But I could have stopped before it started , if I had wanted to , and almost did .
So I know what you mean . ”
Kaitlin pulled the straws from her new drink and began inserting them into the others .
“ So , wise guy , ” she said , eyeing me sardonically .
“ Did you ever have an affair ? ” “ No .
I have dated two women at the same time .
But not an ‘ affair ’ .
” “ Semantics .
Two women at the same time is having an affair . ”
Teresa seemed pleased with her role as the moral arbiter of the group .
I took a sip of Remy and made a face .
“ I do n't feel that way .
I was not in a committed relationship , so it ca n’t be an affair .
” “ Did you ever touch a woman with intent ? ” Teresa leaned on her forearms to bore in on me .
“ Guilty .
But nothing became of it .
A little bit of flirting that got out of hand .
” “ So when does it become an affair ?
When it is it just flirting ?
” I sighed , thought for a moment , and then answered .
“ I ’m not sure .
But I would think that any oral / genital contact , penetration , or even mutual masturbation would qualify as an affair .
A little touching and kissing would not cross the line .
But others may disagree . ”
I looked over at Janet , but it was Teresa who spoke instead .
“ Would hookers count ? ” “ Of course .
Why do you even ask ?
Is a hooker somehow easier to take than an affair with the next door neighbor ? ” “ I thought you would say it does n’t count . ”
Teresa looked disappointed .
“ I think an affair is worse . ”
Janet had finished most of her drink and looked relaxed for the first time since the evening had started .
“ To know that my man was spending emotional energy on another person would be harder for me to tolerate .
A hooker is money , and an affair is emotions .
I think that is a big difference . ”
She poked at the ice in her glass with a straw , trying to tease out more liquid .
Teresa waved her hand dismissively .
“ It does n't matter .
Cheating is cheating …period .
Besides , ” she said , turning to me , “ Hookers have diseases .
How can you risk it ?
” “ Safe sex .
Without exception .
In fact … ” I paused , considered what I was going to say for a moment , then continued .
“ I think girlfriends are a bigger risk , as one is tempted to engage in risky behavior – sex without condoms .
” The rest of the group fell silent as they considered this point of view .
The facilitator , seeing an opening , tried to revive an earlier conversation during dinner about the war in Iraq , but Teresa interrupted as if she was n’t there .
“ Do you like hookers because you can get anal sex ?
” The other man at the table grinned happily , looking back and forth between Teresa and me .
I inhaled deeply from the snifter before answering .
“ Sorry to disappoint you , but hookers are no different than regular folks .
Some do it , many do n't .
But there is something liberating about not having to worry about your lover .
One can concentrate on one ’s own pleasure .
One does not have to worry if she will respect you in the morning or think you are a pervert .
With a lover , it is sometimes difficult to get to that level of intimacy and acceptance … at least for me .
It seems odd , but one can be liberated with a hooker instantly in a way that takes great amount of time with a lover .
” Teresa was looking at me skeptically , and her arms remained folded across her chest .
“ Is that a nice way to say ‘ yes ’ ?
” I sipped cognac .
“ Alright .
Yes , I have had anal sex with hookers .
I have , for the record , had anal sex with several different lovers over the years .
It is not something that I demand .
But if the woman enjoys it , and I can pleasure her in that way , I will .
” “ It ispleasurable to a woman .
That ’s a male fantasy perpetuated by pornography .
” I glanced around the table .
“ Anyone else care to comment ? ” There was another pause and another chance to redirect the conversation , but the facilitator had finally given up , and there was only silence .
Janet cleared her throat .
“ I tried it with my ex .
It did not go so well .
He was too big .
” “ Apparently that is not one of my failings , ” I said ruefully .
All eyes at the table turned towards Kaitlin .
She was slouching again and picking at the end of one of the straws .
“ Well , it can be fun , but only with someone that I trust and love deeply .
I can enjoy that . ” .
“ I do n't believe it , ” Teresa huffed , and took refuge in her drink .
“ Well , I ’m not Wilt Chamberlain , but I have had lovers that really enjoyed anal sex . ”
I glanced at the facilitator , who was ignoring the conversation now , leaning back and looking at something on the ceiling “ They are a minority , but they do exist , ” I added .
Teresa was n’t buying it .
“ You just said you are n’t an expert .
How do you know they enjoyed it ?
” “ They said so .
Have you ever tried it ? ” “ Never , ” Teresa said .
The smug tone had reappeared .
“ You might try something before knocking it .
” Teresa gave me what she hoped was a withering look .
“ I know enough to know that is not something that I would like .
” In spite of the mellowing effects of the cognac , I found myself increasingly irritated with Teresa .
“ Good .
A woman should know her limits .
” And with this last , the conversation faltered .
As if on cue , the waiter approached the table and dropped off a leather booklet with the check ; the facilitator caught it on the first bounce .
Everyone took the hint and stood to leave .
As they gathered up their coats , Kaitlin edged her way over to me .
“ That was the most fun I have ever had at one of these events . ”
I looked at her with surprise , and renewed optimism , but then she continued : “ At first I thought you were a jerk .
Now I do n’t think you are a jerk anymore .
I might not want to date you , but you do know how to keep a conversation interesting .
” For the first time all evening , I found myself at a loss for words .
Kaitlin had been a possibility ; this was indeed a shame .
Everyone shook hands and said goodbye and thanked each other for the pleasant evening .
Then the facilitator drew me aside and offered to refund my money , suggesting that I not contact the agency again .
I decided not to tell her that this would be easy , since I did not contact them in the first place .
I repaired to the restroom for much - needed relief .
As I stood waiting for my bladder to empty , I mentally replayed the conversation with Teresa .
The moral of the story , I decided , was this : Women demand honesty from a man because they associate honesty with respect ; not because they want to talk about strippers , hookers , and anal sex at the dinner table .
I shook myself dry and washed my hands .
I wondered how I would explain the evening to my friends , and hoped that they would get their money back .
Pushing my way through the bathroom door , I turned and headed towards the lobby .
Teresa was standing there , holding her coat .
She looked at me for a few moments , and I looked at her , and she did n’t look away .
Keeping a laptop for more than three years can cost a thousand dollar according to a study conducted by technology consulting firm J.Gold Associates .
A laptop standard span life is up to three years but for many companies to save money they extend the replacement of laptops up to five years and they think they save money by foregoing the the replacement of laptops after the laptops life span which is a costly mistake .
The decision to save money by keeping laptops cost more ; the study found that extending the use of a laptop two years after its life span can cost companies more than $ 1,000 per machine in repair costs , which is more than it would cost to purchase replacements .
Aside from cost matter , the study also shows that through a two - year period - companies suffer from decreased end - user productivity , which the study found can cost the company an additional $ 9,600 per laptop user .
Recently , Wipro Product Strategy and Services also release a research study showing company who wishes to save money by keeping old computer cost more .
The research study conducted by Wipro Product Strategy and Services sponsored by Intel Corp. which is titled as â€ œCost Effective Strategies for the Timesâ€ figured how businesses can save more with a new technology than keeping old system , a whopping 52 % savings can be reap with a new PCs compare to a 4year old System .
In conclusion , both research , shows that in year 4 , support costs are higher than the cost of a new Mobile or Desktop PCs and a delaying refresh also results in delaying the rollout of new management and security capabilities which further impacts the cost of supporting existing systems .
Alicia Istanbul woke up one recent Wednesday to find herself locked out of the Facebook account she opened in 2007 , one Facebook suddenly deemed fake .
The stay - at - home mom was cut off not only from her 330 friends , including many she had no other way of contacting , but also from the pages she had set up for the jewelry design business she runs from her Atlanta - area home .
Although Istanbul understands why Facebook insists on having real people behind real names for every account , she wonders why the online hangout did n't simply ask before acting .
" They should at least give you a warning , or at least give you the benefit of the doubt , " she said .
" I was on it all day .
I had built my entire social network around it . "
Facebook 's effort to purge its site of fake accounts , in the process knocking out some real people with unusual names , marks yet another challenge for the 5 - year - old social network .
As Facebook becomes a bigger part of the lives of its more than 200 million users , the Palo Alto , California - based company is finding that the huge diversity and the vast size of its audience are making it increasingly difficult to enforce rules it set when its membership was smaller and more homogenous .
Having grown from a closed network available only to college students to a global social hub used by multiple generations , Facebook has worked over the years to shape its guidelines and features to fit its changing audience .
But requiring people to sign up under their real name is part of what makes Facebook Facebook .
To make sure people can't set up accounts with fake names , the site has a long , constantly updated " blacklist " of names that people can't use .
Those could either be ones that sound fake , like Batman , or names tied to current events , like Susan Boyle .
While there are dozens of Susan Boyles on Facebook already , people who tried to sign up with that name after the 47 - year - old woman became an unlikely singing sensation had more difficulty doing so .
Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt acknowledged that Facebook does make mistakes on occasion , and he apologized for " any inconvenience . "
But he said situations like Istanbul 's are very rare , and most accounts that are disabled for being fake really are .
" The vast , vast , vast majority of people we disable we never hear from again , " he said .
Because the exceptions are so rare , he said , prior notification is " not something we are doing right now . "
Facebook is available in more than 40 languages - and growing - and its user base is larger than Brazil 's population .
But financially it is still a startup .
Although the Internet research firm eMarketer estimates that Facebook generated about US $ 210 million in U.S. advertising revenue last year , that 's well below the US $ 585 million estimated for the News Corp . - owned rival , MySpace .
Facebook is still looking for ways to become self - sustaining and reduce its reliance on outside investors .
In 2007 , Microsoft Corp. bought a 1.6 percent stake in the company for US $ 240 million , though Facebook later concluded it was n't worth anywhere close to the US $ 15 billion market value implied in that investment .
Because Facebook has only about 850 employees worldwide , getting complaints answered can take a long time .
Istanbul , whose father is from the city of Istanbul in Turkey , said it took three weeks to get her account reinstated .
Without being able to log in for that time , she said she felt " completely cut off " from her contacts .
Frustrated , she wrote e-mails , then mailed letters to 12 Facebook executives .
To keep in touch with her friends and monitor her business pages , Istanbul said she sort of " hijacked " her husband 's account .
" I think they just assume you can't have an interesting name , " she said of Facebook .
" I kept my maiden name because it 's such an interesting name , I did n't want to give it up .
And now I am having to defend my name . "
The suspension of Robin Kills The Enemy 's account inspired a friend to create the group " Facebook : do n't discriminate against Native surnames !!! " on the site .
The group has more than 3,200 members , including some with Native American last names who've had their account disabled .
Causing offence
" If you deal with this kind of thing all the time , and on top of that Facebook wants you to prove your identity , ... it 's adding insult to injury , " said Nancy Kelsey , a graduate student at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln , who started the Facebook group .
She said Facebook should remedy the problem so that it " would n't be so offensive " each time a real name is deemed fake .
" Native American surnames mean something , " she said .
" They are points of pride , points of identity .
It 's not someone trying to make up a fake name . "
Istanbul 's sister , Lisa Istanbul Krikorian , also got locked out of her Facebook account , which she opened a year and a half ago .
So she opened another one that omits her maiden name .
Their mother and their cousin , who both joined the social network more recently , were not even allowed to sign up under their real names .
" They had to misspell their last names , " Alicia Istanbul said , so that Facebook 's system of weeding out fake accounts would n't recognize them .
Her mom added an extra " n " to spell " Istannbul , " and her cousin added an " e " to become " Istanbule . "
The last name Strawberry also raises a red flag with Facebook , so to get around the namebots many Strawberrys have resorted to misspelling their names - to " Strawberri , " " Sstrawberry " or " Strawberrii . "
But that makes it difficult to reconnect with old classmates and long - lost friends , something Facebook prides itself in helping facilitate .
" No one is going to find you if your last name is spelled wrong , " Istanbul said .
Unlike many other social networks , Facebook wants a real name behind each person 's account .
Facebook says its " real name culture " is one of the site 's founding principles .
It creates " accountability and , ultimately , creates a safer and more trusted environment for all of our users , " Schnitt said .
" We require people to be who they are . "
Once the site disables an account it deems fake , its holder has to contact Facebook to prove it is real .
In some cases , the company may require that the person fax a copy of a government - issued ID , which Facebook says it destroys as soon as the account is verified .
Yet an informal search on Facebook shows that efforts to weed out fake names may be a Sisyphean task .
A recent search for " stupid , " for example , turned up more than 27 people matches , most looking dubious at best .
They join some 20 " I.P. Freely " accounts and 13 " Seymour Butts . "
Although many of the fake accounts are created as sophomoric humor or as a vehicle for malicious activity , others are to protect users from having their postings create problems when they later look for jobs or apply to school .
Facebook has extensive privacy settings , but they are complicated and many people do n't know how to properly use them .

Who knows , maybe Kevin Garnett will pull a Willis Reed in Game 7 .
Who knows , maybe Kevin Garnett will pull a Willis Reed in Game 7 .
I measure excruciating losses by the amount of time I walk my dog afterward .
That 's my ritual .
My team gets crushed , I walk it off .
The walks usually last for 15 - 20 minutes .
The walk after Game 6 lasted for hours .
I think I ended up in Compton .
At one point , Rufus just stopped .
He had enough .
It was like 9:45 at night .
We were in the middle of nowhere .
We were like 250 blocks from my house .
I think we were on the same street where Ricky Baker got gunned down in " Boyz n the Hood . "
Rufus planted his furry butt on a sidewalk and stared me down .
" I 'm not going back until you explain to me why Doc put Tony Allen in the game , " I told him .
He kept staring at me .
" We were up by five , " I said .
" We had scored on like 10 straight possessions .
We were humming .
They could n't stop us .
The series was over . "
More staring .
" Two and a half minutes left and we have the ball .
Again , they can't stop us .
So Doc brings in our worst player -- our least intelligent player , our most ineffective player , the master of the fantastic drive / missed layup -- and takes out Big Baby when he was our second - best player tonight ?
And all because Chicago went small ?
SO WE'RE REACTING TO A DESPERATION COACHING MOVE BY VINNY DEL NEGRO !!!!!
REALLY , THAT'S WHAT WE DID ????????? "
More staring , coupled with some panting .
INBOX OVERLOAD From Tony Allen to Ray Allen to everyone else , Game 6 between Boston and Chicago made Bill Simmons ' inbox explode .
• Game 6 : The readers have spoken
" And then , Tony ends up missing back - to - back shots and Chicago ties the game ????
And it goes three overtimes and we lose because we make two straight 3 - pointers with our toes on the line , then a WNBA player dunked on Paul Pierce , then we went to a guy shooting 4 - for - 47 on the deciding play when we have the best clutch shooter in the league and he had 51 points ? "
At this point , I honestly expected Rufus to say something .
Everything was in play , even talking dogs .
We are watching a first - round series in which five of the first six games have come down to the final play .
Four of those games went into overtime .
One went into double OT .
One went into triple OT .
It 's the wildest first - round series ever played .
Whatever happens in Game 7 , we will remember it as one of the most incredible matchup in NBA playoff history .
Derrick
Rose took the superstar training wheels off .
Rajon Rondo turned into Isiah Thomas , The Sequel : Just as talented , just as hated , just as nasty .
Ben Gordon and Kendrick Perkins turned into Andrew Toney and Robert Parish .
The great Ray Allen became a minus - 130 favorite in the " Reggie Miller versus Ray Allen " argument and might have to change his name to " The Great Ray Allen . "
Paul Pierce added to his legacy and sullied it a little at the same time .
Brad Miller made the Faces Hall of Fame and the Dorkiest White Guy Celebrations Hall of Fame .
John Salmons and Glen Davis put themselves on the map as bona - fide NBA players .
Kirk Hinrich redeemed his career .
Stephon Marbury destroyed what was left of his career .
Doc Rivers and Vinny Del Negro inspired their players and undermined them at the same time .
There were so many great plays and shots and moments that they have all blurred together .
I 've watched every second of this series and cannot remember how many clutch shots Ray Allen nailed over the past five games .
The number might be nine .
The number might be 15 .
The number might be 23 .
I could n't tell you .
They have all morphed into one super - duper clutch Ray Allen shot :
The man flying off a screen , lulling his defender to sleep , then springing for his shot with perfect form .
He is the greatest pure shooter I have ever seen .
Ever .
Not since Bird has anyone given me the feeling , " We might be down three , but we are absolutely tying this game . "
I watched every moment of this series and can't remember how many times Derrick Rose wheeled into the lane , spun one way or the other and either scooped in a layup or a floating one - hander .
He does it again and again and again .
He does it whenever he wants .
Thank God , Vinny has n't noticed .
I have never seen a better athlete play point guard .
It was n't that he blocked Rajon Rondo 's game - winning shot in Game 6 as much as how beautiful the play itself was :
Rose sniffing out the move , mirroring everything Rondo did , then jumping like a frog and swatting the shot as cleanly as you can swat a shot .
A perfect basketball play .
That 's what it was .
There are many great things about sports , but here 's one of the best :
You never know when two teams will click .
I used a boxing analogy in my column after Game 2 , and it still stands .
Styles make fights and styles make playoff series .
Has to be a constant tug between young and old , unstoppable and stoppable , physical and finesse , experience and inexperience , fast and slow , big and small , stupid and smart .
You need guys continually rising to the occasion and pushing themselves to a level they did n't know they had .
You need two teams ( or fighters ) hugging each other afterward and thinking to themselves , " Thank you .
You brought out the best of me .
Thank you . "
We love sports for the simple reason that we never know when this will happen .
It rarely does .
We watch a lot of crummy games .
We watch sporting events that had potential to be great and were n't .
We watch sporting events that almost made it , but one dumb thing happened to screw it up :
A foul at the wrong time , a penalty , a two - base error , whatever .
We keep watching .
We keep hoping .
And when everything clicks , it 's blissful .
I am hearing from people who have n't e-mailed me in years .
Readers are sending me 700 - word e-mails .
The thing that keeps jumping out :
Even fans without rooting interests have gotten swept up in this series .
How can you not ?
Think of all the crap we deal with as fans .
" Bulls - Celtics 2009 " explains why we put up with every story about Clemens and Bonds and Michael Vick and Terrell Owens and everyone else who conspires to make sports less fun .
On the same day of Game 6 , a story broke that Alex Rodriguez was allegedly seen with human growth hormone .
The story was digested and consumed in the same predictably brief cycle : Mainstream
Web sites and blogs and message boards and sports radio first , then " PTI " and " Around the Horn , " then " SportsCenter , " then newspapers and magazines .
You can either throw yourself into that cycle or look the other way .
I am getting older .
I just want to watch sports .
I have trained myself to look the other way .
This stuff clutters my brain , and not in a good way .
I just want to watch sports .
I just want to watch sports .
So yeah , that 's why Celtics - Bulls meant something to me -- just like Warriors - Mavs meant something two years ago .
My team won the title last year .
I 'm only one year into a five - year grace period .
I thought I was playing with house money .
I never imagined a Celtics series in 2009 would matter this much to me .
I never imagined being that crestfallen after a Round 1 defeat .
When Noah stole the ball from Pierce and dunked on him , I threw a tantrum like a little kid .
I screamed out a slew of F - bombs .
I ran outside my house and screamed some more .
How could the 2008 Finals MVP commit such a dumb foul ?
He had five !
Did n't he know he had five ????
And what 's worse than a Jo- No celebration at the expense of your own team ?
I screamed and screamed and screamed .
That play ripped my heart out .
At the same time , I 'm glad I still care .
I 'm glad it still matters .
I will always appreciate this Bulls team because they did the impossible :
They made a fan base that just won a title care even MORE about their own team .
Last season barely matters right now .
All that matters is winning the most incredible playoff series ever played .
I do n't even care what happens after Game 7 ; we can't beat the LeBrons anyway .
This is our NBA Finals .
Right here .
The Celtics fans feel that way , and so do the Bulls fans .
I can promise you .
I thought about all of these things during my marathon walk .
And this , too :
When I was 6 , my father took me to the greatest basketball game ever played : Game 5 of the 1976 Finals .
I slept through the second half , the first overtime and most of the second overtime before waking up for Havlicek 's running banker .
I can still see it .
Happened right in front of us .
The Celtics won that one in three overtimes .
Thirty - three years later ( ironic number ) , they played another three - OT classic and lost .
I was a little boy for the first one ; for the second one , I watched most of it with my little boy .
He had no idea what was going on .
When he 's older , I 'm going to tell him that he did .
Sports keeps moving .
You get older .
You pass the love down to your kids .
You think you will care less ... and you do n't .
The Tony Allen sub killed me .
The Pierce foul killed me .
The Rose block killed me .
Two toe - on - the - line 3 - pointers ... I can't stop thinking about them .
Add everything up and that 's how I ended up 500 blocks from my house fretting about Game 7 and rehashing everything that happened in the other six .
By the time we returned home , Rufus was dragging like Ray Allen at the end of that third overtime .
I felt bad for him .
He looked at me like he was thinking , " Please Lord , never again . "
He demolished his first bowl of water in 2.34 seconds .
He demolished the second one in 5.67 seconds .
Then he passed out .
He might not wake up until tomorrow .
I do n't have the heart to tell him that another marathon walk might be looming on Saturday night .
My best - case scenario would be the Celtics winning in quintuple - OT , followed by Ray Allen and Ben Gordon collapsing into each other 's arms like Apollo and Rocky as Allen says , " Ain't gonna be no rematch . "
My worst - case scenario would be grabbing Rufus ' leash with a frown and rubbery legs .
Either way , I am prepared for anything : KG pulling a Willis Reed , Jordan and Bird showing up , Rondo hitting John Salmons with a chair , Doc running the series - deciding play for Tony Allen , Kevin Harlan 's head flying off his body , Tim Thomas experiencing a human emotion , you name it .
That 's the best thing about this series :
Anything is possible .
The ceiling has n't just been removed , it 's been obliterated .
Call it Game 7 , call it Round 15 , call it whatever you want .
Just remember to call it the greatest first - round series ever played .
I hope and pray it does n't end with me taking a walk .

It appears that when it comes to teen brain development , parents should be more worried about alcohol abuse than marijuana abuse .
Two recent studies have been published showing that alcohol -- a legal substance ( though not legal for teens in the U.S. ) -- is considered more dangerous than marijuana , which is illegal in many countries .
One study has been published in the U.S. , in the journal Clinical EEG and neuroscience : official journal of the EEG and Clinical Neuroscience Society ( ENCS ) , and shows that alcohol has a stronger effect on teen brain development than marijuana .
The other is a study published in the Lancet , offering the results of substance classification by a number of U.K. professionals , purporting that alcohol is more dangerous than marijuana to individuals and to society .
The U.S. study was undertaken by Squeglia , Jacobus and Tapert in a San Diego State University / University of California San Diego joint doctoral program .
The study looks at teen brain development for its uniqueness , as well as for the effects that substance abuse has on the brain during this time .
Because alcohol and marijuana are commonly used by high school students , it is little surprise that the study is interested in the brain abnormalities stemming from abuse of these substances .
When the brain abnormalities were measured -- seen in terms of brain functioning and structure , cognitive tasks and quality of white matter -- it appeared as though alcohol had a great effect than marijuana .
Heavy drinking was defined 20 drinks per month , and the abnormalities were detectable .
In heavy marijuana users , abnormalities existed , but not to the same degree as those seen in alcohol abusers .
Findings from the U.S. study , showing that alcohol use in teens causes more irregular brain function than marijuana , would seem to square with efforts in the U.K. to encourage new drug classification .
In the Lancet , David Nutt at Bristol University , along with his colleagues , asked psychologists and scientifically or medically trained police to rank different substances according to how harmful they are .
The study purports that experts rank alcohol ( and tobacco ) as more harmful than marijuana .
In a list of 20 substances , alcohol came in at number five , tobacco came in at number nine , and marijuana / cannabis came in at number eleven .
These studies are likely to add fuel to movements in both the U.S. and the U.K. to re-classify marijuana .
Supporters of fewer restrictions on marijuana will undoubtedly point to scientific studies that show we already legalize less dangerous substances .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Former White House political adviser Karl Rove and counsel Harriet Miers have agreed to face questions from Congress about allegations of improper political influence in the Justice Department , the House Judiciary Committee announced Wednesday .
Harriet Miers and Karl Rove have agreed to talk about allegations of improper firings of nine U.S. attorneys .
Both will give depositions to investigators from the committee , and claims of privilege will be " significantly limited , " according to a statement from the committee .
Rove and Miers had been resisting congressional subpoenas about the matter since the House Judiciary Committee began trying to force Miers to testify in 2006 .
The Bush White House resisted , claiming she could not be compelled to appear .
But a federal judge in Washington ruled that the former Bush administration officials had no grounds to invoke executive privilege in the case .
The committee , led by Rep. John Conyers , D- Michigan , has been investigating claims that Rove and his White House allies fired U.S. attorneys for political reasons and prosecuted officials whom they saw as opponents .
Conyers called the agreement " a victory for the separation of powers and congressional oversight . "
" It is also a vindication of the search for truth , " Conyers said in a statement accompanying the announcement .
" I am determined to have it known whether U.S. attorneys in the Department of Justice were fired for political reasons , and if so , by whom . "
The controversy stems from the 2006 firings of the top federal prosecutors in nine U.S. cities , some of whom were singled out because they were considered insufficiently " loyal Bushies , " according to one e-mail from a former Justice Department official uncovered in the probe .
U.S. attorneys are political appointees who serve at the pleasure of the president .
But the Justice Department 's description of the firings as " performance - related " once the shake - up became public triggered an outcry from the fired lawyers and led to allegations of political influence on Justice Department hiring decisions and cases .
In September , the department 's internal watchdog found the process behind the firings " fundamentally flawed " and sharply criticized top Justice officials , including former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
Its report called for an outside probe to examine potential charges , and Gonzales ' successor , Michael Mukasey , appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the case .
The Bush White House insisted the firings of the nine U.S. attorneys were legal .
But Democrats said the central questions behind the dismissals -- who decided the prosecutors should be ousted and why -- remain unanswered .
Rove was former President Bush 's top political adviser for most of his two terms , and Miers was the top White House legal adviser from 2005 until early 2007 .
They had been resisting congressional subpoenas in the investigation , citing executive privilege .
Rob Saliterman , a spokesman for the former president , issued a statement saying the deal had been reached " at the urging of the Obama administration and in consideration of the executive branch interests at stake . "
The agreement " satisfies the Committee 's desire for additional information and will finally put this matter to rest , " Saliterman said .
Congress went to court to enforce the subpoenas , and a federal judge in Washington ruled last year that the former Bush administration officials had no grounds to invoke executive privilege .
After Rove received a new subpoena in January , the Obama administration said it was reviewing whether Rove and Miers were still covered by executive privilege and worked to clear the way for Wednesday 's agreement .
White House counsel Greg Craig said the deal allows the committee to go forward with its investigation .
" The president is pleased that the parties have agreed to resolve this matter amicably and that they have committed to work in good faith to bring about a timely and final resolution of this matter , which is in the interest of the American people , " Craig said in a statement from the White House .
The Justice Department will file a joint motion from Congress and the administration to put the court case on hold , Justice officials said , allowing it to be reopened if necessary .
CNN 's Ed Henry and Terry Frieden contributed to this report .
If a bee bite ( sting ) is acidic you do n't use acid to counter acid you use a base .
I have always used baking soda , a few drops of tea tree oil ( you can get it at walmart ) mixed with just enough water to make a paste .
This will handle ANY vespid or apies stings as well as mosquito bites , and even some forms of excema .
To prevent mosquito bites altogether , take a small soda bottle ( empty ) stuff it with the foliage of ' mosquito plant ' ( it 's a geranium hybrid your local nursery will have it . ) ' lemon grass ' and black - stemmed peppermint .
Then fill to the top with Witch Hazel ( also bought at Wal - Mart ) and let it sit for a few days .
Rub this concoction in the major hit points , neck , ankles , back of the knees and on the wrists .
This will usually keep you from getting hit .
An additional note on mosquitoes .
There is no such thing as an actual ' repellent ' .
Nothing repels mosquito's except the sub-sonic sound of dragonfly 's feeding .
All you do is confuse the mosquitoes receptors from identifying CO2 .
Smokers tend to give off more CO2 than non-smokers .
The mosquito's do n't bite you because they can't ' see ' you due to the confusion of CO2 receptors being blocked or inhibited .
If the Mediterranean bluefin tuna fishery is not closed , the bluefin will be functionally extinct by 2012 according to a new analysis from World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) .
While the population has undergone steep declines for over a decade , fishery managers and policy - makers have continually ignored calls from scientists that fishing must stop if the Mediterranean bluefin tuna is to survive .
“ Mediterranean bluefin tuna is on the slippery slope to collapse , and here is the data to prove it , ” said Dr Sergi Tudela , Head of Fisheries at WWF Mediterranean .
“ Whichever way you look at it , the Mediterranean bluefin tuna collapse trend is dramatic , it is alarming , and it is happening now .
WWF has no choice but to again urge the immediate closure of this fishery . ”
The new analysis shows that the breeding population was cut in half in five years , from 2002 - 2007 .
At the same time the size of breeding fish has dropped drastically : around 50 percent in 15 years depending on the area of the Mediterranean .
In a news release WWF points to numerous factors that have led to the bluefin ’s plight in the Mediterranean : “ the huge overcapacity of fishing fleets , catches that far exceed legal quotas , pirate fishing , the use of illegal spotting planes to chase the tunas , under - reporting of catch , fishing during the closed season , management measures disregarding scientific advice , and the insatiable appetite of the world ’s luxury seafood markets . ”
The Mediterranean bluefin tuna season opens tomorrow , April 15th .
Last November the International Commission for the Conservation of the Atlantic Tuna ( ICCAT ) decided to pursue a fishing season in 2009 allowing for 22,000 tons of bluefin tuna to be caught in the Mediterranean , despite calls from scientists and some members to close the fishery altogether for the year .
“ For years people have been asking when the collapse of this fishery will happen , and now we have the answer , ” said Dr Tudela .
“ Mediterranean bluefin tuna is collapsing as we speak and yet the fishery will kick off again tomorrow for business as usual .
It is absurd and inexcusable to open a fishing season when stocks of the target species are collapsing . ”

Abstract Background Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae that affects almost 250,000 people worldwide .
The timing of first infection , geographic origin , and pattern of transmission of the disease are still under investigation .
Comparative genomics research has suggested M. leprae evolved either in East Africa or South Asia during the Late Pleistocene before spreading to Europe and the rest of the World .
The earliest widely accepted evidence for leprosy is in Asian texts dated to 600 B.C. Methodology / Principal Findings
We report an analysis of pathological conditions in skeletal remains from the second millennium B.C. in India .
A middle aged adult male skeleton demonstrates pathological changes in the rhinomaxillary region , degenerative joint disease , infectious involvement of the tibia ( periostitis ) , and injury to the peripheral skeleton .
The presence and patterning of lesions was subject to a process of differential diagnosis for leprosy including treponemal disease , leishmaniasis , tuberculosis , osteomyelitis , and non-specific infection .
Conclusions / Significance Results indicate that lepromatous leprosy was present in India by 2000 B.C.
This evidence represents the oldest documented skeletal evidence for the disease .
Our results indicate that Vedic burial traditions in cases of leprosy were present in northwest India prior to the first millennium B.C.
Our results also support translations of early Vedic scriptures as the first textual reference to leprosy .
The presence of leprosy in skeletal material dated to the post-urban phase of the Indus Age suggests that if M. leprae evolved in Africa , the disease migrated to India before the Late Holocene , possibly during the third millennium B.C. at a time when there was substantial interaction among the Indus Civilization , Mesopotamia , and Egypt .
This evidence should be impetus to look for additional skeletal and molecular evidence of leprosy in India and Africa to confirm the African origin of the disease .

Introduction Leprosy is a debilitating but treatable disease caused by infection with Mycobacterium leprae .
Although popular conceptions of leprosy are focused primarily on images from Biblical or Medieval times , one quarter of a million people worldwide were still suffering from the disease in 2007 — primarily in rural areas of Bangladesh , Brazil , China , Democratic Republic of Congo , Cote D'Ivoire , Ethiopia , India , Indonesia , Mozambique , Myanmar , Nepal , Nigeria , Philippines and Sudan [ 1 ] .
The history of leprosy is “ interwoven with civilization itself ” [ 2 ] .
An understanding of the origin and transmission routes of this disease can potentially lead to new insights about the evolution of infectious diseases and eradication efforts .
However , the disease is difficult to culture in vitro and much about leprosy is still poorly understood , including the origin , initial transmission routes , and timing for the spread of the disease in the Old World .
The earliest textual references to leprosy are found in proto-historic texts , including the Egyptian Ebers papyrus dated to 1550 B.C. [ 3 ] .
It has been suggested that there are references to the disease in Sanskrit hymns of the Atharva Veda composed before the first millennium B.C. [ 4 ] and the Old and New Testaments of the Bible [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
However , this evidence is controversial [ 3 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] and the earliest widely accepted references to the disease are from much later sources : South Asian texts Sushruta Samhita and Kautilya 's Arthashastra dated to the 6th century B.C. [ 4 ] , [ 7 ] , 4th century accounts of the Greek author Nanzianos [ 8 ] , a 3rd century Chinese text Shuihudi Qin Jia [ 9 ] , and 1rst century A.D. Roman accounts of Celsus and Pliny the Elder [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 10 ] .
Historians of the disease have maintained that leprosy originated in the Indian subcontinent and spread to Europe after the fourth century B.C. [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] but the disease did not become a serious public health problem in Europe until the Middle Ages [ 10 ] .
Asylums were established by the 7th century in France [ 14 ] and skeletal evidence for the disease is well documented for Medieval European skeletal collections from the United Kingdom [ 10 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , Denmark [ 18 ] , Italy [ 19 ] , Czech Republic [ 14 ] , and Hungary [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
Although urbanization has traditionally been considered requisite for the spread of the disease in the Old World [ 8 ] , genomics research has indicated a Late Pleistocene model for origin and transmission out of Africa [ 12 ] .
Archaeological evidence for the disease in Africa and Asia in prehistory has also provided indications that the disease has ancient roots .
Skeletal evidence of leprosy has been documented in the 2nd century B.C. in Roman period Egypt [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , the 1rst millennium B.C. in Uzbekistan [ 24 ] , Nubia in the 5th century B.C. [ 25 ] , and Thailand circa 300 B.C. [ 26 ] .
The earliest documented cases in West Asia ( Israel ) are from the 1rst century A.D. [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] .
Previously there was no skeletal evidence for the disease in South Asia .
We report here on skeletal evidence for leprosy from 2000 B.C. at the site of Balathal ( 24°43 ′N 73°59′E ) , located 40 km northeast of Udaipur in the contemporary state of Rajasthan , India ( Figure 1a ) .
There are two phases of occupation represented at Balathal , a small occupation in the Early Historic period ( cal. B.C. 760 - A.D. 380 ) and a large Chalcolithic settlement ( cal. B.C. 3700 –1820 ) [ 30 ] .
The Chalcolithic people of Balathal lived in stone or mud - brick houses , made wheel thrown pottery , copper implements , and practiced dry field agriculture focused on barley ( Hordeum vulgare ) and wheat ( Triticum spp . ) .
The Chalcolithic deposit demonstrates evidence of Harappan influences in the classical tan ware ceramics , which resemble Harappan red ware in manufacture , fabric , firing , and vessel forms [ 31 ] .
Copper objects include razor blades , knives , chisels , arrow heads , spearheads , and axes .
Two burials were recovered from the 1994–1997 excavations of the Chalcolithic deposit — individuals 1997 - 1 and 1997 - 2 .
Three additional burials were recovered in the 1999 –2002 excavations of the Early Historic period — individuals 1999 - 1 , 1999 - 2 , and 1999 - 3 [ 32 ] .

This paper concerns individual 1997 - 1 who was buried inside a stone enclosure at Balathal .
The stone enclosure was a Chalcolithic construction overlain by an undisturbed layer ( layer 5 ) of sterile , white ashy soil 20 – 30 cm in thickness .
This sterile layer separated Chalcolithic from Early Historic deposits over the entirety of the mound .
This layer accumulated over a span of 1000 years from 1800 – 800 B.C. during a time of increasingly aridity in western India [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] , [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] .
The enclosure ( 500 m2 ) was built at the eastern periphery of the settlement .
The walls measure 27×37 m in length and it was built around a foundation 70 cm thick , constructed of mixed clay , silt , brickbats and bricks .
The walls of the stone structure are thickest at the base ( 6.5 m thick ) and taper ( to 4 m thickness ) toward the top of the construction , which along with the platform foundation , is a construction style that resembles Indus citadel construction at Kuntasi and Rojdi in Saurashtra , Gujarat [ 31 ] .
A radiocarbon date from Layer 13 in Trench E4 ( Figure 2 ) dates the earliest deposits of ash to 3350 B.C. ( cal. B.C. 3620 –3100 ) .
The presence of monumental architecture and new ceramic styles at Balathal from 2400 – 1700 B.C. has been interpreted as evidence for contact with the Indus civilization during this phase [ 33 ] .

Balathal Phases I–III Chalcolithic structures uncovered during the 1994–1997 excavation seasons .
The skeleton was uncovered in layer 7 of quadrant E3 and the radiocarbon date of 2000 B.C. was obtained in layer 7 of quadrant F4 , both of which are within the stone enclosure .
The Early Historic phase is not represented here as that portion of the site was excavated in 1999 – 2002 .
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005669.g002
Radiocarbon dates of the stratified layers in the excavated site provide definitive evidence that the skeleton was buried between 2500 – 2000 B.C.
Inside the stone enclosure there are stratified layers of vitrified ash from burned cow dung that appears to have been thrown into this space from the top of the stone wall ( Figure 1 b ) .
Individual 1997 - 1 was interred in a tightly flexed posture , on its left side within undisturbed stratified layers of the burned cow dung ( at a depth of 2.66 m , in layer 7 of the Northeast Quadrant of trench E3 ) .
There are 45 radiocarbon dates for the entire site of Balathal , 30 from the Chalcolithic layers , perhaps the most complete assessment of radiocarbon chronology for any South Asian site .
All of the dates from within the stone enclosure were from the Chalcolithic period [ 30 ] , which spanned the calibrated date range of 3700 – 1800 B.C. according to 25 radiocarbon dates [ 30 ] , [ 33 ] .
Two radiocarbon dates were obtained from charcoal recovered from Layer 7 in the stone enclosure .
A date of 2000 B.C. ( cal. B.C. 2200 –1980 ) was obtained from trench F4 .
A date of 2550 B.C. ( cal. B.C. 2830 –2310 ) was obtained from Layer 7 in trench D4 .
Thus the skeleton was buried sometime between 2500 – 2000 B.C .
Methods Individual 1997 - 1 was inventoried and described [ 32 ] using standard macroscopic techniques in bioarchaeology [ 38 ] .
This individual is estimated to have been a male based on pelvic architecture [ 39 ] , a determination supported by skeletal size and robusticity .
The innominates are fragmentary but the right and left auricular surfaces , the left sciatic notch , and the right pubis are preserved .
There is no pre-auricular sulcus and the sciatic notch is narrow .
The right pubic bone has a narrow sub-pubic angle and a rhomboid shape , indicating that this individual was male .
Age was estimated based on the pubic symphysis [ 40 ] and dental attrition [ 41 ] .
The form of the pubic symphysis indicates that this individual was 37+/−5 years old when he died .
This individual suffered from antemortem tooth loss , which combined with other oral pathologies ( described below ) could certainly influence the amount of wear on the remaining teeth [ 32 ] .
The technique yielded an age estimate of 35+/−10 years , which is consistent with the estimate from the pelvis .
The length of the humerus provided an estimate for stature of 1.78+/−0.04 meters [ 42 ] .
Differential diagnosis was undertaken through a comparison of the presence and patterning of lesions in the skeleton with expectations from the paleopathology literature .
Results
This individual was preserved with a fairly complete skull but the postcranial skeleton is incomplete and fragmentary [ 32 ] .
Evidence for bone pathology on the facial skeleton includes erosion / remodeling of the lateral and inferior margins of the nasal aperture , complete atrophy of the anterior nasal spine , bilateral osteolytic lesions at the infraorbital region of the maxilla , evidence for infection in macroporosity of the supraorbital region at glabella , and resorption of the anterior alveolar region of the maxilla ( Figure 3a ) .
The palatine process of the maxilla also demonstrates pathological changes including pitting near the midline and in the alveolar region indicating superficial inflammation affected regions that had not already resorbed ( Figure 3 b ) .

Antemortem tooth loss affected the majority of the maxillary teeth , with only the left first molar and fourth premolar remaining in situ .
There are two large periapical abscesses on either side of this molar but there is no other evidence of pulp chamber exposure or abscessing .
Slight traces of the alveoli remain for the right canine , third premolar , second and third molars and the right second molar is present as an isolated tooth .
The molar roots demonstrate a thickening of the apices indicative of hypercementosis .
Antemortem tooth loss and alveolar resorption has also affected the mandible ( Figure 4 ) but eight mandibular teeth remain in situ — right and left central and lateral incisors , canines , right third premolar , and the right third molar .
Alveolar resorption and passive eruption in the anterior mandible has exposed an average of 7 mm of root surface in the incisors and canines .
Resorption in the left posterior mandible has obliterated the alveoli and only a thin segment of the mandibular corpus remains .

In the postcranial skeleton , there is evidence for extensive degenerative disease with marginal osteophytes affecting most of the joint surfaces present , including the right and left glenoid fossae of the scapulae , left humerus ( proximal epiphysis : head and trochanters ) , right and left ulnae ( lunar and radial notches ) , left radius ( distal epiphysis ) , the vertebral ends of the right and left ribs , left innominate ( around the perimeter of the acetabulum ) , the right and left femoral heads , and the proximal end of the left tibia ( lateral condyle ) .
The fourth through the seventh cervical vertebrae had severe degenerative changes including ventral wedging , osteophytic lipping on the margins of the centra and on the superior and inferior articular surfaces , and vertebral ankylosis , or fusion of the cervical vertebrae ( Figure 5a ) .
Similar changes were noted on the lumbar vertebrae ( L3–L5 ) .
The left pisiform is present and there is a fracture on the articular facet for the triquetral ( Figure 5 b ) .
The proximal half of the left and right tibiae are present and the compact bone surface on the right is irregular and evidence for infection ( periostitis ) is present ( Figure 5 c ) PPT PowerPoint slide

The distal end of the right radius , ulna , and left triquetral are present and show no evidence of pathology .
Many of the elements in the distal ends of the legs are missing — the distal tibiae , fibulae , and many of the foot bones are missing or damaged postmortem .
More specifically , the left medial and intermediate cuneiforms and cuboid are present but damaged postmortem .
All five right metatarsals are present though they have also suffered destruction of the articular ends .
Seven pedal phalangeal fragments are also present but demonstrate no pathological modification .
The distribution of skeletal pathologies is key to a diagnosis of leprosy [ 6 ] .
We expect leprosy to include changes to the skull and the postcranial skeleton : “ cortical inflammatory changes of the palatine process of the maxilla , diaphyseal cortical surface , and intra-articular cortical surface ” [ 43 ] .
The principle change to the skull with leprosy is rhinomaxillary syndrome , which involves loss of bone around the pyriform aperture , destruction of the nasal spine , and loss of bone at the anterior alveolar process [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] .
Leprosy is also associated with pathological remodeling of the facial skeleton at the nasal conchae , infraorbital , and palatal regions , including pitting of the cortical surface indicating increased osteoclast activity and / or bone necrosis [ 46 ] .
In the Balathal skeleton , we have clear evidence of rhinomaxillary syndrome and bilateral expression of infection in the splanchnocranium .
These changes are specifically associated with lepromatous leprosy .
Unilateral facial lesions are more common in the tuberculoid form of leprosy [ 43 ] .
There is evidence of a slight amount of pitting at the midline on the palatine process of the maxilla but no evidence of perforation , although the dorsal part is broken .
Unfortunately , the nasal conchae are missing postmortem .
Postcranial manifestations of leprosy take two forms : direct bacterial invasion by contact with infected elements and injury to appendages related to leprous autonomic neuropathy [ 46 ] .
The former can be manifest in non-specific inflammatory changes at multiple sites while the latter can be manifest in evidence for traumatic injury in wrist , hand , ankle , and foot bones .
Injuries to extremities are not direct evidence for leprosy but they do corroborate the other evidence as they can be associated with the neuropathy accompany infection with leprosy [ 6 ] , [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] .
For this individual from Balathal , postcranial pathologies include degenerative changes in the spine and diarthrodial joints , infectious involvement of the lower leg , and evidence for injury to the left wrist .
Evidence of direct involvement of the hand and foot bones is unavailable although absence of many hand and foot bones could be explained by bone absorption , which would leave the bones more fragile and likely to degrade after burial .
We argue here that these changes are strong evidence for the manifestations of leprosy in 1997 - 1 .
Other potential diagnoses include treponemal infection , leishmaniasis , sinus and oral infections , tuberculosis , osteomyelitis and non-specific infection in the post- crania .
In cases of treponemal disease , remodeling of the nasal aperture , including loss of the nasal spine , can occur [ 49 ] .
However , this individual demonstrates no evidence of other diagnostic criteria for adult treponemal infection including caries sicca , widespread periostitis in the axial and appendicular skeleton , thick or irregular long bones , or saber tibiae [ 5 ] , [ 50 ] .
Periodontal disease and / or caries can lead to antemortem tooth loss and destruction of the alveolar bone in the maxilla and the mandible [ 51 ] .
Oral infections and rhinomaxillary sinusitis can cause inflammatory changes to the rhinomaxillary region [ 52 ] .
Leishmaniasis can also cause destructive lesions of the face , particularly periosteal rections around the nasal spine [ 50 ] .
However , antemortem tooth loss , oral infections , and leishmaniasis are not known to cause destruction of the pyriform aperture and nasal spine , which are diagnostic criteria for leprosy and are present in individual 1997 - 1 .
This individual does not demonstrate some of the classic manifestations of tuberculosis , a chronic infection by a related group of related Mycobacteria , often transmitted through the respiratory system or the digestive tract [ 50 ] .
Individual 1997 - 1 demonstrates vertebral ankylosis , which can be associated with spinal tuberculosis in the adult skeleton .
However , this individual from Balathal does not demonstrate other pathognomic changes of chronic tuberculosis such as osteoporotic changes in the thoracic and lumbar vertebral centra or kyphosis .
In cases of tuberculosis , ankylosis can also affect the knees and hip as a result of septic arthritis [ 53 ] .
The pathological changes to the joint surfaces in individual 1997 - 1 are confined to marginal osteophytes that are typical of degenerative joint disease and / or advanced age .
There is no evidence in individual 1997 - 1 for involucrae , or sequestering of necrotic bone lesions typical of osteomyelitis nor for infectious involvement of the ribs or spine [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 50 ] .
In the postcranial skeleton , non-leprous osteomyelitis is a product of haematogenous spread of bacteria ( usually Staphylococcus or Streptococcus ) often as a result of injury .
This condition is characterized by intermedullary abscess and cloaca formation in the spine , ribs , femur , tibia [ 43 ] , [ 50 ] .
Individual 1997 - 1 does demonstrate periostitis in the tibia that could result from leprosy or some other , non-specific infection .
Given the patterning of lesions , the absence of key diagnostic criteria for treponemal infection , tuberculosis , and osteomyelitis , it is argued here that this skeleton represents the oldest example of lepromatous leprosy in the world .
Discussion
While it has long been thought that leprosy originated in the Old World [ 5 ] , less is known about the origin and prehistoric transmission routes for leprosy than other related infectious diseases [ 53 ] .
Our evidence supports Sanskrit translations of the Atharva Veda that reference leprosy [ 4 ] and supports the suggestion that this ancient text is the earliest historical reference to the disease , its pathogenesis and treatment .
“ Born by night art thou , O plant , dark , black , sable .
Do thou , that art rich in colour , stain this leprosy , and the grey spots ! …
The leprosy which has originated in the bones , and that which has originated in the body and upon the skin , the white mark begotten of corruption , I have destroyed with my charm . ” ( pg. 19 ) As the Sanskrit word kushtha referred to a plant used to treat leprosy and tuberculosis ( rajayaksma ) [ 7 ] , the Atharva Veda is also the earliest text to infer a connection between the two conditions , at least in terms of treatment .
It is not common to find adult burials after 2000 B.C.
In contrast , infants and children under 5 years of age are common in peninsular sites .
These features of second millennium burial practice are suggestive of Vedic tradition .
Given this , it is interesting to note that it is customary in Vedic tradition in parts of India to bury lepers alive [ 54 ] , [ 55 ] rather than cremate their bodies , which as diseased , are not considered an appropriate sacrifice to Hindu Gods [ 54 ] .
The biological evidence presented here indicates that similar mortuary behavior for people with leprosy was present at a rural Chalcolithic village in northwest India by the beginning of the second millennium B.C.
As far as we are aware , this burial from Balathal is also the earliest example of an individual buried in vitrified ash from cow dung prior to the ash circle burials of the Southern Neolithic .
Large stratified deposits of ash are common in the Southern Neolithic ash mounds of the South Deccan and Northern Dharwar region of the contemporary state of Karnataka .
Over 100 ash mound sites have been identified as belonging to the Southern Neolithic period but they are not very well understood [ 56 ] .
The most common interpretation of the ash mounds based on excavations at Budihal and Utner is that they are remains of cattle pens or efforts to rid settlements of cow dung [ 56 ] .
One alternative hypothesis is that they represent remains from funerary practices [ 57 ] .
Some of these ash mounds are associated with megalithic monuments , thousands of which cover the landscape of peninsular India .
These stone circle burials are occasionally found near ash circle burials but these are a less common tradition in the southern Iron - Age ( 800 –500 BC ) .
The occasional presence of ash circle burials in South India has been interpreted as evidence for integration of burial traditions from the Chalcolithic and Iron Age [ 57 ] .
The evidence from Chalcolithic Balathal also serves as a bridge between northwestern Chalcolithic traditions and the burial practices of Southern India in the first millennium B.C. Evidence for leprosy in India at 2000 B.C. can be used to address hypotheses about prehistoric transmission models for the disease .
Although leprosy is often considered to have a recent origin [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 44 ] , analysis of rare single nucleotide polymorphisms in contemporary samples of M. leprae from worldwide geographic regions [ 12 ] identified two strains of leprosy segregating in Asia ( predominantly Type I ) and east Africa ( Type II ) .
Because of the low frequency of the Type II strain in Asia , and its high frequency in East Africa , one scenario for leprosy 's origin is that Type II evolved first in East Africa ( before 40,000 B.C. ) and was later transmitted to Asia ( evolving into Type I ) and Europe ( evolving into Type III ) , which is also common in West Africa and the Americas [ 12 ] .
Alternatively , the Type II strain may have evolved from the Type I strain in Asia much more recently and was then transmitted out of Asia , into Africa and Europe [ 8 ] .
Small sample sizes and potentially biased demographic sampling of M. leprae from contemporary populations in the comparative genomics study could explain the absence of the Type II strain in South Asia ( n = 4 ) .
Sampling issues or fixation of the Type II strain in East Africa ( n = 2 ) , combined with contemporary eradication efforts in India may have lead to an underestimate of the putative ancestral Type II strain 's historical prevalence in India , and the derived Type I strain 's historical prevalence in East Africa .
The Late Holocene transmission scenario is more compatible with the natural history of M. leprae , which thrives on human contact and may have spread to East Africa during the development of urban life and large inter-continental trade networks during the height of the Indus civilization and the “ Middle Asian Interaction Sphere ” [ 58 ] .
The “ Middle Asian Interaction Sphere ” is a term used to describe political and economic contacts between South and West Asian Bronze Age peoples in the third millennium B.C.
There are four core areas involved — Meluhha in the Indus Valley , Turan in Central Asia , Mesopotamia in the Fertile Crescent , and Magan on the Arabian Peninsula .
The evidence for inter-regional interaction includes textual sources from Mesopotamia indicating trade relationships with Meluhha from the Early Dynastic Period ( 2900 –2373 B.C. ) to the time of Hammurabi ( 1792 –1750 B.C. ) .
The interpretation of ‘ Meluhha ’ as ‘ Indus ’ is supported by evidence for trade in raw materials , common artifact styles and motifs among the two regions .
In addition , contact among Mesopotamia and the Egyptians began prior to the Early Dynastic period in Egypt ( 3050 –2686 B.C. ) .
Although leprosy existed in Europe by 400 B.C. [ 13 ] it did not become widespread throughout the urban centers of that continent until the Medieval period , a time of expanding trade networks [ 6 ] .
We argue that if leprosy evolved in Africa in the Pleistocene [ 12 ] , it is unlikely to have spread into Asia and become a serious health issue until the late Holocene , when South Asia and Northeast Africa were part of a larger regional trade network that stretched across the Arabian Sea .
We argue that transmission of M. leprae between Asia and Africa is most likely in the third millennium B.C. , when India had extensive , wide - ranging networks for movements of peoples , goods , and potentially infectious diseases .
This is a more likely time for transmission of communicable diseases such as leprosy than the Late Pleistocene migrations proposed by Pinhasi et al . [ 8 ] and thus supports the interpretation of the genetic data proposed by Monot et al . [ 12 ] .
Further research should be performed to determine the geographic origin of the disease using an integrated approach that examines paleopathology and ancient DNA .
Paleopathological evidence for the disease should be examined in the skeletal collections belonging to Indus Age sites .
Urban centers in the height of the Indus Age and post-urban sites occupied in the second millennium B.C. should be of particular interest .
In addition , the skeletal material from Balathal and from Indus sites should be investigated for evidence of ancient DNA from the Mycobacterium .
There could also be well - preserved molecular evidence in Egyptian skeletons from the second or third millennium B.C.
Although the first skeletal evidence from Dakhleh Oasis places the disease in Egypt only after 400 – 250 B.C. [ 23 ] , the Ebers papyrus has been interpreted as evidence of more ancient knowledge of the disease by 1550 B.C. [ 3 ] .
Assuming that DNA from the Mycobacterium can be obtained from individual 1997 - 1 , genetic comparison of the strain from Balathal and additional skeletal specimens may provide new insights into the origin of the disease if a relationship could be demonstrated with either the Type I or II strains previously identified [ 12 ] .
Until the origin of leprosy is confirmed through additional research , the significance of this individual from Balathal is that it marks the earliest skeletal evidence for lepromatous leprosy , demonstrating its presence in a North Indian population during a time of substantial interaction among populations throughout Asia , the Middle East , and Africa .

Web giant Google rolls out first ad campaign on US networks to promote web browser Chrome
Google has launched its first television advertising campaign across a range of US networks .
The company 's TV adverts are an attempt to draw the public 's attention to Chrome , the web browser that it launched last year in an attempt to compete with Microsoft 's Internet Explorer .
The company has famously avoided traditional marketing in the past – indeed , its website boasts that it has become " one of the world 's best known brands almost entirely through word of mouth " .
But Google is desperate to raise the profile of Chrome , which launched to great fanfare last September but has so far failed to make major inroads on its competitors .
According to statistics from Net Applications , Internet Explorer continues to win the browser wars with a market share of 66 % .
In second place is Mozilla 's Firefox , which is used by 22 % of web users , while Apple 's Safari program comes third with 8 % .
Chrome , meanwhile , is the choice of just 1.4 % of internet users .
It remains to be seen how mainstream audiences will respond to the clip , however , which has no voiceover , does not mention the fact that it is advertising a web browser and only displays the Google logo at the very end .
The campaign is also an attempt to highlight the effectiveness of the company 's TV Ads system , which lets Google act as a broker to sell advertising time on television networks .
Most advertisers and TV broadcasters consider the scheme to be an interesting but niche experiment , after striking just a handful of high - profile deals since it first began two years ago .
Google is hoping that the Chrome campaign can help push the concept of using TV Ads into the minds of media executives .
The 30 - second spot shows a stop- motion animation in which a tray of children 's play bricks is rearranged to resemble a browser window – an image intended to represent the simplicity and ease of using Chrome .
In a statement on the official Google blog , the company said that the video was made by a team from Google Japan as a YouTube clip , but had proved so successful that it had decided to take it on to traditional television .
" After releasing this video on the web , we got lots of positive feedback and thoughtful comments , " said the company .
" We designed a Google TV Ads campaign which we hope will raise awareness of our browser ... we 're excited to see how this test goes and what impact television might have on creating more awareness of Google Chrome . "

Inmate Gets 60 More Years in Prison for Mobile Phone Possession
Texas inmate Derrick Ross , 38 — a three - time burglary felon — has been sentenced to 60 additional years after he was caught having a mobile phone in his possession .
Mobile phones are n’t allowed behind bars be they could easily be used to make drug deals , order hits and carry out other illegal / gang - related activity .
Although the official punishment for habitual offenders for this crime is 25 to 99 years , sometimes even life in prison , perpetrators usually end up getting 2 to 10 years instead .
In Ross ’s case , prosecutor Allyson Mitchell explained that tacking on 60 extra years to Ross ’s existing sentence is mostly to send a message to other inmates , visitors and unethical officers that not only is having a mobile phone in prison a serious offence , but also that they are not afraid to spend 60 more years of the taxpayers ’ money just to teach people a lesson .

Approximations of Pi ( and other numbers ) as Fractions
A discussion with a friend and his daughter this morning led me to remember an intriguing function from the Haskell standard library – approxRational .
We were talking about his daughter learning in school that pi is ( according to her class notes ; it ’s quite likely that the teacher was actually more correct ) “ 3.14 , or 22/7 ” .
Even the 11 - year - old among us knew that something was wrong ; her calculator told her that 22/7 was not exactly 3.14 .
They are both approximations , of course , which was easy to explain .
But then she wanted to know why we choose those particular approximations .
And that was an interesting question .
With decimal numbers , of course , you just pick a number of digits and round it off .
Sure , this depends on the base used to represent the number , and that ’s ugly … but it ’s called the decimal system for a reason .
With fractions , the situation is less clear .
Why would you want to remember 22/7 ?
There ’s a whole host of other possibilities : for instance , 3/1 , or 7/2 , or 16/ 5 , or 311/99 , or 355/113 .
( That last one , as we ’ll see later , is a particularly good choice . )
Some of those fractions are easier to remember than 22/7 .
Others are closer to pi than 22/7 .
We ’ve got two competing values here :
We want the result to be easy to remember .
If we seek a result ( as I do ) that ’s not somewhat arbitrary ( note that using base 10 itself is arbitrary , and therefore so are criteria like wanting round numbers , or numbers whose digits form patterns ) then the only good interpretation of “ easy to remember ” is “ using small numbers ” .
We also want a number that ’s close to pi .
Clearly , we ’re looking for some kind of a balance here .
Well , Haskell ’s approxRational function to the rescue .
The documentation for this function says :
approxRational , applied to two real fractional numbers x and epsilon , returns the simplest rational number within epsilon of x .
A rational number y is said to be simpler than another y' if
abs ( numerator y ) <= abs ( numerator y ' ) , and
, and denominator y <= denominator y' .
Any real interval contains a unique simplest rational ; in particular , note that 0/1 is the simplest rational of all .
The claim that any real interval contains a unique simplest rational is an interesting one .
Simplicity , as defined here , is a partial order .
That is , 1 / 2 is simpler than 2/3 , which is in turn simpler than 3/4 .
But if one asks which of 2/3 or 3 / 2 is simpler , there is no answer .
Those numbers are incomparable with respect to the simplicity order ; neither is simpler than the other .
In general , with a partial order , there may be any number of minimal elements in a given set ; possibly none at all , or possibly infinitely many .
The claim here is that with this particular partial order of simplicity , and this particular set being an interval of real number , there is precisely one .
This turns out to be not terribly hard to prove .
Suppose you have two rational numbers a /b and c /d .
Then let e=min ( a , c ) and f=min ( b , d ) .
It ’s not hard to see that e/f is at least as simple as either a /b or c/d ( this by definition , basically ; if e/f can be reduced , the result is more simple , not less ) , and also that it falls between a /b and c/d so that it must be in any interval that contains them .
It ’s not necessarily the simplest rational in the interval , but it proves that no two rational numbers can both be minimally simple over an interval than contains both of them .
This also provides a pretty powerful tool in answering our question .
If we decide in advance how much inaccuracy we ’re willing to accept in our approximation , then there is a unique approximation that ’s easiest to remember , and approxRational will tell us what it is .
This immediately eliminates some possible approximations .
For example , you should never approximate pi as 7/2 , because 3 is both easier to remember , and closer to pi .
By considering ever smaller intervals and using approxRational , one can obtain a sequence of approximations that are simplest for some amount of allowable inaccuracy .
Prelude Data.Ratio > map ( approxRational pi ) [ 0.5 ^k | k <- [ 1..6 ] ] [ 3%1,3%1,13%4,16%5,19%6,22%7 ]
Up to a certain level of accuracy , the best approximations appear to be 3 , 13/4 , 16/5 , 19/6 , 22/7 , or 201/64 .
But ah , how to choose .
One clue is afforded by the fact that the number 3 appears twice in the list .
In fact , if we extended the list further , we ’d discover that 22/7 appears 3 times !
If a number is simple enough to beat out other approximations for somewhat large intervals , but also good enough to keep winning for very small intervals , then this bodes well for its being a good general - purpose choice .
It ’s a decent measure of the efficiency of the number .
Let ’s get some more precision in the choice of intervals , and then count up the number of occurrences :
Prelude Data.Ratio Data.List Control.Arrow Data.Function > take 10 $ reverse $ sortBy ( compare `on` fst ) $ map ( length &&& head ) $ group $ map ( approxRational pi ) [ 0.99^k | k <- [ 1..10000 ] ] [ ( 6414,884279719003555%281474976710656 ) , ( 572,355%113 ) , ( 297,22%7 ) , ( 288,5419351%1725033 ) , ( 194,3%1 ) , ( 168,1146408%364913 ) , ( 143,312689%99532 ) , ( 120,833719%265381 ) , ( 110,80143857%25510582 ) , ( 109,165707065%52746197 ) ]
I did the same sort of thing , but considered many more values for epsilon , then grouped recurring elements of the list , measured their lengths , and sorted on them .
Initially , the best approximation seems to be quite ugly : 884279719003555/281474976710656 .
That ’s an illusion , though .
Because pi is itself a floating point constant in Haskell , it is actually equal to a rational number , and that ’s the one .
So it ’s occurrence at the top of the list means only that we ’ve looked as far as we can .
The remaining answers are true approximations .
22/7 does indeed fair pretty well , though it ’s narrowly edged out by 355/113 , which is an even more efficient ( in fact , to get closer to pi than 355/113 , you have to go all the way to 52518/16717 !
The lesson ?
Who knows ?
22/7 is a pretty decent choice for teaching 11 - year - olds about fractions that are close to pi. 355/113 would be better , if you think they can remember numbers that big .
And approxRational is fun .
Exercise for the interested reader : implement an inverse to approxRational .
That is , given a rational number , can you determine the adjacent simpler rationals ?
If so , you could work backwards : take the most precise possible rational approximation of pi that fits in a Double , and then determine how far you have to move away to get a simpler rational that approximates it .
( Hint : there are only finitely many rationals simpler than a given rational .
You should n’t consider them all , but if you think about what it would look like to list them , you can find a decent search strategy . )
The strange , strange Cubs rumor that wo n’t die .
The Chicago Cubs are still interested in signing Pedro Martinez to join the bullpen or maybe even the rotation .
And apparently it ’s all Rich Harden ’s fault .
Watching right - handed pitcher Rich Harden struggle with his command has made the team ’s management group a little nervous as of late .
Harden has given up 11 home runs already this season , matching his 2008 total with Oakland and the Cubs combined .
If Harden continues to waver from start to start , the need for another starter or a bullpen pitcher will become more and more a reality .
ESPN Chicago .
Even if Rich Harden ’s torn shoulder explodes into a shoulder supernova , that does n’t mean the Cubs have to sign anyone , let alone a complete flyer like Pedro Martinez .
They have a guy who would be a 3rd or 4th starter for most teams already in the pen in Sean Marshall .
Jeff Samardzija has been starting at AAA Iowa , and so had new bullpen call - up Kevin Hart .
There are other options for this team than over - spending on a broken 39 - year old .
Oh , and that ’s all assuming Rich Harden is done – which he ’s , like , not .
The Cubs have had a scout in the Dominican Republic watch a couple of Pedro ’s workouts .
The quality of the individual is almost as important to the team as his stuff .
Martinez at his best now is a five - innings - and - fly guy .
Throwing at 83 or 84 miles an hour with his variety of off - speed pitches might get Pedro by a majority of big league hitters for a couple of months .
One theory would have him go to the bullpen and set up or close if the back end of the Cubs ’ staff begins to falter in the dog days of the season .
Martinez is smart enough to be able to reinvent himself as a reliever and outfox hitters for one or two innings .
The young Latin American pitchers on the staff would benefit from having an outstanding person and a future Hall of Famer as a mentor .
Martinez , if healthy , might be a linchpin for a contender like the Cubs in their second - half pursuit of a pennant .
Wow .
How many garbage , bs reasons for a move can you pack into two paragraphs ?
Pedro is now a quality individual ?
And that ’s supposed to mean something ?
Throwing 83 mph and then some off - speed stuff ( so , what , 70 mph ? how about just rolling it up there ? ) is enough to get by for a couple months ?
Pedro is smart enough to “ outfox ” hitters for an inning or two ?
Young Latin pitchers could benefit from Pedro ’s presence ( a guy who once beat up Don Zimmer ) ?
If healthy , he could be a linchpin ?
Good Lord .
I hope these ideas are coming from Bruce Levine , himself , and are n’t being floated to him by anyone within 1,000 feet of the Cubs front office .
THE Federal Reserve has ventured ever further into the political realm , propping up failing companies , lending to industries other than banks and financing the federal budget through purchases of Treasury bonds .
Now the politicians are threatening to respond in kind .
By law , the Fed is independent .
The president and Congress can do no more than name its seven governors , including the chairman .
The governors share responsibility for monetary policy with presidents of the 12 reserve banks which are supervised by the board ; these presidents are appointed by their banks ' boards and confirmed by the governors .
That Congress may not audit the Fed or approve its budget provides an added element of security .
But that may now be at risk .
“ The role of the Fed has changed dramatically , so the usual defence of , well , we should n't intrude in the integrity and independence of the Fed , I think , no longer applies , ” said Max Baucus , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , on March 31st .
Gene Dodaro , who heads the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) , Congress 's investigative arm , complained that his ability to monitor federal support for the financial system is hamstrung because the GAO cannot audit the Fed 's monetary - policy or lending operations .
Two days later , when the Senate voted for a federal - budget outline , it included a non-binding resolution giving the Senate authority to audit the Fed and requiring the central bank to disclose the name of anyone to whom it lends .
A less draconian resolution requires the Fed to describe its collateral at regular intervals and calls for an “ evaluation ” of the Fed 's reserve banks .
Congress has often targeted these banks , whose presidents are more likely to vote for higher interest rates than the governors .
Even friends of the Fed question the usefulness of the 12 banks and their geographical distribution , which reflects the country 's political make - up in 1913 .
When viewed in isolation , the resolutions do not amount to much , since they do not aim to intrude on monetary policy and are not binding .
Carrying them out would require a change in the law which is unlikely for now .
The Fed itself has begun a “ top - to - bottom ” review aimed at boosting its transparency , although it is highly unlikely to agree to name borrowers .
A possible alternative to giving the GAO auditing authority would be giving more powers to the Fed 's own inspector - general .
The latest actions are troubling nonetheless .
The Fed 's interventions have been defensible given the scale of the crisis and lack of alternatives , but they have exposed it to public anger over bail - outs for bankers .
Tim Geithner , the treasury secretary , owes his recent problems in part to having overseen the bail - out of American International Group , an insurer , in his previous job as head of the New York Fed .
The controversy also comes at a delicate moment for the Fed.
Two governors ' seats are vacant and Ben Bernanke 's four - year term as chairman ends next January .
The Fed also needs favours from Congress : it would like authority to issue debt securities to soak up the excess liquidity its rescue operations have created , or for the Treasury to have authority on its behalf .
The Treasury is seeking to revamp financial rules and give the Fed more sway over the financial system .
Hostile congressmen could seize on such initiatives to impose changes that the Fed does n't want .
As if to pre-empt threats to its independence , the central bank and the Treasury released a joint statement last month affirming their shared responsibility for financial stability and the Fed 's sole responsibility for monetary policy .
It was meant to be reassuring , but it mostly served to emphasise how much the Fed has become entangled in fiscal and financial policy .

. Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich published a letter to RNC Chairman Mike Duncan on his website that denounced a recent video by the RNC which attempts to link president elect Obama to the soon to be impeached Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich .
Gingrich said Republicans need to focus on solutions , not negative attacks .
Here is the RNC video titled Questions Remain :
Advertisements
Gingrich wrote in his letter to Duncan , “ The recent web advertisement , “ Questions Remain , ” is a destructive distraction .
Clearly , we should insist that all taped communications regarding the Senate seat should be made public .
However , that should be a matter of public policy , not an excuse for political attack .
In a time when America is facing real challenges , Republicans should be working to help the incoming President succeed in meeting them , regardless of his Party .
He continued , “ From now until the inaugural , Republicans should be offering to help the President - elect prepare to take office .
Furthermore , once President Obama takes office , Republicans should be eager to work with him when he is right , and , when he is wrong , offer a better solution , instead of just opposing him .
This is the only way the Republican Party will become known as the “ better solutions ” party , not just an opposition party .
And this is the only way Republicans will ever regain the trust of the voters to return to the majority . ”
Gingrich also called for the ad to be taken down , “ This ad is a terrible signal to be sending about both the goals of the Republican Party in the midst of the nation ’s troubled economic times and about whether we have actually learned anything from the defeats of 2006 and 2008 .
The RNC should pull the ad down immediately . ”
He is right .
The Republican Party has not learned anything from their losses in 2006 and 2008 .
Instead of using their defeats to reinvent themselves , the Republican leadership is continuing as if they are ignoring the recent landslide loss .
I believe that as long as our political structure is going to exclude viable third parties , in order for the system to work , we must have two strong parties .
No matter which party is in control , one party rule is not good for our democracy .
The Republican Party could benefit from working with Obama on issues that they agree with him on , but this does n’t look like the direction that they are going to choose .
Instead it seems that they will be content to play the role of the obstructionist minority , to the determent of the national interest .
The recent Republican Senate opposition to the automaker bailout was a fine example of this .
Senate Republicans would rather try to maintain their anti-union ideology and bust the UAW , then do what ’s best for the economy .
With each move the Republican Party is falling further out of step with the rest of America , and the worst part about it is that they do n’t seem to care .
How many elections will they have to lose before they finally get it ?
“ Those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . ” – George Santayana
Last week the Committee on Justice and Human Rights heard testimony on Bill C - 15 , legislation introduced by the Conservative Party to enact mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses in Canada .
I was one of the witnesses invited by the Committee to provide evidence to help inform deliberations .
Myself and six other witnesses testified to the evidence demonstrating the ineffectiveness of mandatory minimum sentencing to address the problems of drug - related crime and violence .
Yet it seemed clear , from the comments of the Committee members and public record of proceedings to date , that the Canadian Parliament will ultimately approve this misguided legislation in its desire to appear ‘ tough on crime ’ and make constituents in British Columbia believe it is ‘ doing something ’ about the gang violence that has plagued communities , particularly in Vancouver as it prepares for the upcoming Olympic Games in 2010 .
New York Rockefeller Drug Laws : A cautionary tale
The history of New York ’s infamous Rockefeller Drug Laws ( RDL ) should serve as a cautionary lesson of how easy it is to enact bad criminal justice policy and how difficult it is to repeal it — even when there is strong consensus for change .
In 1973 , New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller — frustrated about the perceived failure of his drug treatment initiative , angry over the inmate rebellion at the state prison in Attica and looking to improve his political image with conservative Republicans who thought he was too liberal – proposed legislation to make New York ’s drug laws the “ toughest in the country . ”
When Gov. Rockefeller first announced his new ‘ get tough ’ approach to drug dealers and users , the proposal was decried by all including the states prosecutors and judges as “ harsh , vindictive and unworkable , ” however by taking such an extreme position Rockefeller accomplished his goal of moving everyone else to the right by forcing others to take a harder line on drugs than they ever had before .
The RDL enacted later that year , mandated prison terms for numerous drug - trafficking crimes based largely on the weight of the drug sold .
A first - time offender convicted of selling two ounces or possessing four ounces of heroin or cocaine received a mandatory sentence of 15 years to life — the same as the penalty for murder .
Possessing as little as half a gram of cocaine or heroin triggers a minimum sentence of at least one year .
Also enacted in 1973 , the Second Felony Offender Law ( SFOL ) required with some exceptions a mandatory state - prison term for persons convicted of a second felony offense within 10 years of the first .
Under New
York ’s criminal statutes the sale or attempted sale of any amount of a controlled substance is a Class B felony punishable with imprisonment .
( Class B is the second most serious class of felony offenses . )
As a result of his newly tough stance on drugs and ‘ welfare cheats , ’ Rockefeller was successful in rehabilitating his image among Republican Party leaders .
By 1974 he had sufficiently reformed himself that there was little objection to his selection by Gerald Ford as his Vice - President when he assumed the Presidency upon Nixon ’s resignation .
His time on the national stage was short - lived , by 1977 his political career was over and he was back to private life .
He died of a heart attack in 1979 .
That same year Governor Hugh Carey and the state legislature agreed to reform some of the harshest aspects of the law following the recommendation of a commission of lawyers and prosecutors that found .
The New York Times reported : “ In too many cases the 1973 drug laws , because of their mandatory and inflexible nature , require penalties which are out of all proportion to the seriousness of the offense or the criminal history of the offender . ”
In their first 20 years , the SFOL , the RDL and other anti-drug laws combined for a steep and steady rise in the portion of incoming prisoners whose last convicted crime was a drug felony .
In 1980 , a drug crime was the most serious conviction offense of 11 per cent of the state ’s prisoners ( 886 people ) .
By 1993 , that fraction had risen to 44 per cent ( 10,939 people ) .
The RDL came down hard on people who were not exactly kingpins .
In a 1993 case , an appeals court reviewed the sentence of Jesus Portilla , an asbestos remover with a wife and small child .
A first - time offender , he had received a sentence of eight and a third to 25 years for a $ 30 cocaine sale .
Mandatory minimum sentences are not the answer
The assertion that mandatory minimum drug sentencing policies can be justified as an effective deterrent to crime has been discredited by numerous studies and analysis of the impact of such laws .
This criticism has not been limited to those with liberal beliefs about politics and crime — conservatives , including some who previously espoused ‘ tough on crime ’ approaches have called for the repeal of mandatory minimum drug sentences .
John J. DiIulio Jr. , a criminologist , is emblematic of this shift .
DiIulio was initially skeptical of the notion that drug laws imprison large numbers of people who are not menaces to society .
But by 1995 DiIulio became an outspoken critic of current sentencing policy and called for the repeal of New York ’s RDL .
“ It seems to me that with respect to these drug offenders , the mandatory minimums have begun to go haywire . ”
He went on to say the following in a notable article in the National Review ( 1999 ) : “ There is a conservative crime - control case to be made for repealing mandatory - minimum drug laws now .
That ’s a conservative crime - control case , as in a case for promoting public safety , respecting community mores , and reinstating the traditional sentencing prerogatives of criminal court judges .
. . .
To continue to imprison drug - only offenders mandatorily is to hamstring further a justice system that controls crime in a daily war of inches , not miles , and that has among its main beneficiaries low - income urban dwellers . ”
Harsh New York laws finally repealed
After more than 35 years of harsh mandatory drug sentencing the political consensus for change in New York reached a tipping point .
I ’m happy to report that this year the New York State legislature finally did what the public has been requesting it do for years — it voted to repeal most of the remaining vestiges of the Rockefeller drug laws .
It is ironic to me that Canada is considering enacting a law very similar to the one it took us so long to undo in New York .
I do n’t want to see your country repeat our mistake ; the harms caused by 35 years of bad sentencing policy will take a long time to repair .
For many years , drug sentences throughout the United States , have been shaped by public concerns and political pressures that have been indifferent to the need for proportionality .
Many factors — the persistence of drug use and abuse , the deterioration of inner cities , the rise of symbolic politics , racial undercurrents , a fear of crime and an unwillingness to tackle social inequalities , among others — encouraged politicians and public officials to embrace inordinately tough sentences for drug felonies .
Do n’t be taken in by politicians claiming the answer to the drug problem is to take a ‘ get tough ’ approach .
We do n’t need to be tough on crime ; we need to be ‘ smart on crime . ’
Being smart means investing in what has been demonstrated to work : evidence - based drug treatment ; effective drug education ; proactive family support programs and early and continuous support for ‘ at - risk ’ youth .
In this way we demonstrate our societal commitment to invest in people , not prisons , to show compassion , not indifference , to help , not punish .
Urge your legislator to defeat Bill C - 15 !

Obama seeks $ 83.4 billion for Iraq , Afghanistan wars Agence France - Presse
Published : Thursday April 9 , 2009
Print This Email This US President Barack Obama is asking lawmakers for 83.4 billion dollars more to pay for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan through 2009 , White House aides said Thursday .
" The supplemental will likely go to Congress today , " Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters , using the term for a request for money outside the usual budget process .
Another White House aide provided the dollar figure .
" A supplemental is required in order to fund the new strategy in Afghanistan and fund the process in Iraq that will lead to a drawdown of all of our combat troops , " said Gibbs .
The request is likely to include aid money for Pakistan as part of the revamped Afghan war strategy , and could include help for the Palestinians , another US official said .
Obama had firmly opposed using supplementals to fund the two wars and grouped them in his regular budget for fiscal year 2010 , which begins October 1 , but the US military needs money now .
" We can't wait until the appropriations process is done in September or August or September to fund operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in June , " said Gibbs .
" The honest budgeting and appropriations process that the president has talked about falls somewhat victim to the fact that this is the way that wars have been funded previously , " the spokesman said .
But " this will be the last supplemental for Iraq and Afghanistan , " he promised .

Recently got the woot.com deal on the eeepc 900 , sans webcam .
I tried to use the xanadros os that was bundled with it for a few days , but the lack of normal gnu tools and normal packages made me want to switch .
So I decided to to look into putting my os of choice fedora onto it .
Installing :
Found that is was a dooable project , exciting and surprising .
Since the netbook does n't have a dvd-rom drive , and I lent out my external , I decided to go the usb live stick route .
Directions for this were easy to find , I did have to use the command line version of them , and found through trial and error that only my name brand Kingston drive would get the netbook to boot .
To get the usb drive to boot , hit escape while booting or hit f2 and set the main drive to be the usb drive .
After it boots and finishes and installs , everything pretty much works .
When I brought up the machine I started to follow Gavin 's_directions and run a general update .
This failed , only because it filled the small hard drive up .
I then had to find the / var / cache / yum / updates / packages / directory and clear it by hand , because yum did n't have the room to run and remove the rpms itself .
Removing things to make space :
So now I had to sleuth around to find out what was taking up all the space on the drive .
Using
du - Hs - si /*
found that the largest folder in the root dir was usr .
And walking down that path structure I found that the three largest folders , that I could do something about , were :
/usr/share/locale @ 332MB
/usr/share/doc @ 106MB
/usr/share / fonts @ 223MB
So I really went through and removed a whole lot of this stuff , which depending on ones needs , may not be advisable .
I removed all fonts that could using yum instead of just deleting them , as that just really seemed like a bad idea .
It took a bit of grep'ing , so this line is a little long , but it basically strips out all the extra fonts , and keeps liberation as well as core font tools and libs .
I personally use Anonymous , for all my coding , and terminal work , and I put that in . fonts dir , so really even this is a bit liberal for me .
rpm - qa | grep font \ | grep - ve ' xorg ' - ve ' core ' - ve ' liberation ' - ve ' fontconfig ' - ve ' lib ' -ve ' bitmapfonts ' -ve ' ghostscript ' \ | xargs yum -y erase
Note also that this removes these apps :
gimp
abiword
evince
ghostscript ( even though I tried not to )
This frees up most of the 200MB that the fonts dir takes up , so we 're off to a good start .
The locale directory I was unfamiliar with , but some searching found that this is where data for other language support is stored .
I only speak one , and found that removing these does n't cause irreparable harm .
So delete them I did .
Since these are installed with every program , and the language packs do n't have their own RPMs yum was n't useful in this case .
ls /usr / share / locale / * -d \ | grep -ve ' locale.alias ' -ve ' default ' - ve ' en ' \ | xargs rm -rf
This frees up about another 300MB .
But it is also something that will crop up again , since any new program you install will add it own locale information .
For apt - get there is a nice plug - in that will automatically strip out this information for you on install , but in my shallow searching for this for yum there did n't seem to be a substitute .
Might be a good weekend project .
The share doc directory I just cd'ed into and wiped out its contents .
This is a netbook , and I can ssh into my home machine to read those if I need to , so I freed up another 100 or so MB with this wipe .
This brings us a lot closer to a good 1 GB of free space .
I went further and removed a few apps I wo n't be using :
evolution
rhythmbox
cheese
Now to try and get the services under control .
Found this great listing of what each service does , so if you 're unsure if you want to stop as many as I chose to , look it up and make sure .
I also chose to use the command line service conf tool :
/sbin/chkconfig -- list
So its a bit time consuming but I went through the chkconfig list and grepped out the 5 : on states and checked them against my list below and set them to off one at a time for every run time level .
There might be a quicker way , but I could n't think of one that did n't involve making a script , so I let it be , and stuck with manual .
cron , atd , anacron
auditd ( also disabled SELinux )
avahi-daemon
bluetooth
btseed , bttrack
capi
cups [ *]
firstboot
ip6tables
irda
irqbalance
isdn
kerneloops
lm_sensors
mdmonitor
multipathd
netconsole
netfs
nfs
nfslock
nmbd
nscd
pcscd
portreserve
restorecond
rpcbind
rpcgssd *
sendmail
smb
ypbind
Now not all of those services were up , but I just made the list of what I would remove , and did n't take note of what was not running in that list .
Then I installed my must haves : xfce , vim , htop , all the dvcs ' , tilda , and tomboy .
I rsync'ed over my dot dirs that I wanted , and I was good .
From Conservapedia
Traditionalist Catholicism refers to a loosely - defined movement of Catholics who reject some or all of the changes made to Catholic liturgy and / or theology during the Second Ecumenical Council of the Vatican ( or “ Vatican II ” ) , a massive gathering of church leaders that brought about dozens of sweeping reforms .
Traditionalist Catholics are best known to outsiders for their preference for celebrating mass in Latin rather than in the local vernacular .
The largest of the Traditionalist Catholic societies is SSPX .
Some traditionalist Catholics reject the papal authority of Pope John XXIII ( who called for the Vatican II council ) or Pope Paul VI ( the first post - Vatican II Pope ) , as well as their successors .
This doctrine is called Sedevacantism , meaning “ vacant seat ” .
As could be imagined , the Holy See denounces traditionalist Catholic organizations who espouse this belief , while other groups within the movement may enjoy full communion with Rome .
Vatican II
The Second Vatican Council represented the largest formal change to Catholic Church practices in centuries , and attempted to complete the “ unfinished ” work of the First Vatican Council , which had taken place a century prior .
The stated goal of both Vatican Councils was to adapt the church to fit a changing world , combating emerging liberal tendencies in the secular world and paving a new way for the church to keep relevancy .
Other changes were put into place in light of recent findings related to the early church in order to bring the Catholic Church closer to its roots .
Some changes [ 1 ] include :
The encouragement of vernacular language for use in Mass , ending the use of Latin , which most laity did n’t speak or understand .
The ability of laity to distribute the Eucharist .
Ecumenical endeavors were encouraged in order to strengthen relations between the Catholic Church and other religious groups , including Protestant denominations .
Protestants and Orthodox Christians were declared to be “ separated brethren ” of the church .
The idea of Jews being referred to as an “ accursed people ” for their rejection of Jesus was denounced .
Canon law and the Catechism were revised and rewritten ( though this change took place very gradually ) .
More freedom was given toward allowing contemporary music in worship , a change which notably brought about the use of guitars in church buildings .
Marian devotions , while still fervently encouraged by the Church , were toned down in terms of formal reach , with many calls to devotion in churches being replaced with other practices .
This was done in response to what was seen as “ self - centered individualism ” within the devotions , which was seen as superseding the communal nature of the liturgy .
The liturgical calendar was altered , both in terms of dates and practice , with some minor holidays being removed .
Some customs , such as abstaining from meat on Fridays or fasting prior to receiving the Eucharist , were abolished or made of lesser importance .
More frequent participation in the Sacraments was encouraged .
Traditionalist vs. “ Modernist ” View
Most traditionalist groups view the Vatican II changes as liberalizing , with some going so far as to say they represent an abandonment of what it means to be Catholic , and / or signify a shift in the church toward protestantism .
“ Modernists ” ( non-traditionalist Catholics ) tend to have the opposite view , seeing Vatican II as a reinforcement of Catholicism and a return to form .
Some traditionalists supportive of the Latin Mass have said that celebrating the mass in vernacular “ strips it of its holy quality ” and inspires doubt that Jesus is literally present in the Eucharist .
Conclavism
As mentioned above , “ sedevacantism ” denotes a tendency of some traditionalist Catholics to reject the authority of post - Vatican II Popes .
A small handful of groups prefer to take this idea further by claiming to hold the “ true ” authority and electing “ Popes ” of their own , a practice which is called “ conclavism ” .
Conclavist claimants to the papacy can be viewed as modern day Antipopes , many of which have adopted the name “ Peter II ” ( in reference to St. Peter , who is believed by Catholics to be the first pope ) , likely to illustrate a claim to represent a new beginning of sorts .
Perhaps the most famous Conclavist is Pope Michael .
Conclavist groups are a very small minority within the traditionalist movement , however . [ 2 ]
Growth in France
Like much of western Europe , the religious landscape of France tends to be highly secular and atheistic , with a growing presence of Islam .
However , traditionalist Catholicism recently has seen a curious growth in France , with traditional Priests accounting for 20 % of ordinations in 2018 , [ 3 ] and drawing in ire and concern from secular French leadership . [ 4 ]
Many traditionalist Catholic groups operate schools and social pressure groups in France , such is the case of Civitas . [ 5 ]
These groups tend to operate in smaller towns and villages , but their influence can occasionally be wider .
Traditionalist Catholicism and Politics
Some traditionalist groups have had a political presence , whether intentional or unintentional .
Traditionalists tend to espouse right - wing social views , and have been extensively slandered by the notoriously dishonest far - left Southern Poverty Law Center ( SPLC ) as a result , with the SPLC coining the term “ Radical Traditional Catholicism ” in reference to some groups , likely in order to make them seem more threatening . [ 6 ]
As mentioned above , traditionalist Catholics in France operate pressure / protest groups which are opposed to secularism , homosexual “ marriage ” , abortion , etc .
The influence of such groups can be seen in the efforts of mainstream or modernist French Catholics in recent years as well , with Catholicism.org writing in 2019 that Catholicism is visible in the French political landscape “ for the first time in decades ” . [ 7 ]

Part 1 : Taking The First Step By Matthew C. Keegan
S o , you 're considering a career in corporate aviation .
Congratulations !
This particular segment of general aviation is one of the most exciting and well paying fields in all of flying .
Tens of thousands of other individuals have selected a similar pursuit including maintenance technicians , dispatchers , charter salespeople , flight attendants , customer service representatives , cockpit crew , and more .
Each person and position brings a special contribution to the corporate arena , one that is both similar and vastly different from the commercial or airliner end of flying .
How to begin
Follow the yellow brick road !
Oh , were it that easy .
Unlike in commercial aviation , if you want to become a flight attendant you simply attend a company 's open house to find out more information , fill out an application , get interviewed , hired , trained , etc .
A lot of hand holding goes on in commercial aviation , however if you want that type of assurance in corporate aviation many more times than not you will be disappointed .
Corporate [ business ] aviation is simply not structured that way .
Time to do some research
For starters , you have reached the right place .
The Corporate Flight Attendant Community website and message boards acts as a gateway to business aviation for flight attendants .
It is n't the only gateway , but it is one of the most informative .
Knowledge is power and we try to empower people from the newbie all the way up to the veteran .
Read the message boards , particularly Just For Newbies .
In addition the General Discussion board is a great place for , well , general discussions .
Also check out our Inflight Services , Safety and Security , and Stress and Health sections for additional valuable information .
Finally , make sure you look over the Job Opportunities board for sample job listings .
Most jobs in this industry are not posted or published , simply put you have to do a lot of legwork and research to uncover who is hiring .
If you are patient , persistent , and very pro-active you stand a chance of succeeding in this business .
If you are passive , overly particular , and inpatient , then corporate aviation probably is n't what you want .
It is as simple as that .
In addition to the boards , check out the Articles section of the web pages .
Several articles for " Getting Started " in this industry are included .
You 'll notice a similar theme in many of them : corporate flight attendants are essentially a cabin manager in charge of the aircraft from the cockpit door on back .
The person who is well versed and trained in customer service and safety issues will stand a better chance of employment than the person who is n't as well equipped .
Get some training
Unlike flying for the airlines , training is n't standardized .
In fact , you could get hired by a company who will take you " as is . "
In many of those situations , the job is less challenging , the pay much lower .
If they are willing to train you , then you are fortunate .
Most corporate flight attendants must pay for their own training .
Several training companies exist out there [ more in a future article ] and some do better than others as far as equipping the student to work on a corporate jet .
For starters , visit our Industry Links page for links to companies .
Compare what they have to offer against each other ; see which one works out best for you .
Next :
What type of jets will you be flying ?

Ivonne Thein 's ‘ Thirty - Two Kilos ' Exhibit is Scary & Educative
German photographer Ivonne
Thein ’s photo exhibit is a veritable little shop of horrors .
The women in this gallery are horribly emaciated , contorted , their bones are jutting out and their ravaged , sick bodies are wrapped in medical bandages .
The good news about Ivonne Thein ’s “ Thirty - Two Kilos ” anorexia awareness exhibit is that these images are digitally manipulated .
The bad news is that the disease continues to run rampant in the fashion industry and in society as a whole .
Thein conceived the art exhibit in response to the proliferation of pro-anorexia or pro-ana websites where the disease is promoted as a way of life and a viable alternative to weight loss .
The Washington Post notes , “ In a twist that perhaps could have been anticipated , some of the pro-ana sites have embraced Thein ’s work .
On these sites , images of skeletal women provide ‘ thinspiration . ’
One pro-ana blogger posted Thein ’s photos and received mixed comments :
‘ Those pics are so , so beautiful !
I want to look like them !
They look so fragil [ sic ] and like an angel . ’
‘ I still think that some of the models have a big [ rear ] .
How distorted am I ?’
By the way , 32 kg is 70.5 lbs .

This torture will continue until the Catholic Church is denied institutional access to children
Reactions from the Catholic Church to the Irish child abuse report have verged on the insulting .
When one reads the so - called expressions of regret from the perpetrators of these atrocities , it is n’t difficult to understand the palpable fury of those victims who came to make a stand .
“ As we come to better understand the impact of such abuse “ – as though it would have been fine to rape and brutalise very small children if it was thought that it caused no serious long - term damage .
Courage ?
They would never have “ faced up to their past it ” if they had been given a choice .
They have repeatedly bought the silence of those victims who were determined to make the crimes public .
Outside the press conference where the document was launched , one man waved an offer of £ 115,000 that the Church had made to him to stay silent .
But so profound is the damage done to him that nothing would compensate but the bringing to justice of his tormentors .
The Christian Brothers have tried to cover their tracks and intimidate those who wanted these crimes brought to light .
They have gained anonymity for the abusers from the authors of this report .
As it says : “ The Christian Brothers delayed the investigation for more than a year with a lawsuit that successfully defended their members ’ right to anonymity in all references in the report , even in cases in which individual Christian Brothers had been convicted of sexual and physical attacks on children . ”
The state ’s abnegation of its responsibility to these children was also grotesque .
It was completely deferential to these religious institutions , labouring under the impression that priests could be trusted because – well , they were priests .
And even when it became clear what temples of abuse these various orphanages and workhouses were , the state did nothing to stop it , reasoning that the violence was necessary to keep order .
This report should be a salutary lesson for the promoters of faith - based welfare .
It shows clearly what can happen when a religious regime is given unfettered , unregulated power over the weak and vulnerable .
And the Vatican must also answer for its own shameful complicity in all this .
The foul exploitation in Ireland , and all over the world , was known about at the highest levels in Rome , and instead of intervening to stop it , the Vatican conspired to cover it up .
Keith Porteous Wood , Executive Director of the National Secular Society , said that “ the child abuse itself was bad enough but the Church made it worse with its claims that the victims were lying .
The Church also aggravated its betrayal of children with its policy of moving priests who were known abusers to new dioceses where they could continue their abusive activities free from any suspicion .
“ The present Pope , as Cardinal Ratzinger , wrote to bishops as recently as 2001 stating clearly that a 1962 instruction called Crimen Sollicitationis was still in force .
See a facsimile of the document here and a translation here .
This document instructs bishops who are dealing with accusations of sexual abuse to observe strict secrecy and threatens those who speak out with excommunication .
It states that the instructions are to be ‘ diligently stored in the secret archives of the Curia [ Vatican ] as strictly confidential .
Nor is it to be published nor added to with any commentaries . ’ ”
The document was in force for the twenty years after Cardinal Ratzinger was appointed Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith .
It was uncovered only because the Texan lawyer Daniel Shea was doing some research on child abuse in Catholic institutions .
Keith Porteous
Wood added : “ The Holy See is making a mockery of its obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child .
As the Vatican is the depository for this mass of incriminating information hoarded in obsessive secrecy , it certainly has a case to answer about its adherence to Article 34 ( b ) ( “ take all appropriate national , bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent ...
The exploitative use of children in ... unlawful sexual practices . ” ) .
It has also failed to produce three consecutive five yearly reports ( 1997 , 2002 and 2007 ) required by the Article 44 of the Convention .
They can hardly plead that there was nothing to report .
“ As a direct result of the undeserved deference shown to the Holy See , as far as we are aware , no influential body , including the UN , has had the courage to call the Holy See to account .
“ We call on both national and international bodies charged with care for children to join in a demand for these apparent contraventions of the Convention by the Holy See to be highlighted and rectified .
“ Perhaps the crowning injustice for Ireland is that the economically weak Irish exchequer is paying well over a billion Euros towards the victims ’ compensation - while the body responsible , the Church , is contributing less than a tenth of the payments .
“ Nor is there room for complacency in England and Wales .
The Nolan Commission on child protection nominally took over in England and Wales from Crimen sollicitationis , and it called for a review in five years time .
“ The recently retired Archbishop of Westminster Cardinal Murphy O’Connor ( who has his own unresolved history of cover - up ) was the one who asked , and presumably selected , Baroness Cumberlege as Chair of the review progress by the Catholic Church in the protection of children and vulnerable adults .
Confidence in the Commission might have been greater if the appointment had been made by someone demonstrably independent and without any vested interest in the outcome .
Some concern about what seems to be the review ’s powerlessness can be judged from the tone of her report ’s concluding comment on implementation :
‘ It is , of course , entirely a matter for the Conference of Bishops and Conference of Religious whether they accept the recommendations and findings of this report and , if they do , how they will chose to implement them . ’
While there is a positive Church response posted on the Cumberlege Commission ’s website to the Nolan recommendations : “ We now commit ourselves to implementing the Final Report ” , there is significantly no response posted on the Commission ’s website to the Church ’s response to the later Cumberlege recommendations .
And , unfortunately , Lord Nolan concluded only that ‘ These [ Nolan ’s ] recommendations should be reviewed after five years . ’ rather than ‘ These recommendations should be reviewed every five years . ’ ”
And was it only last month that the Pope was expressing his “ profound sorrow ” to the 150,000 native Canadians who had been forced into Catholic Institutions where their culture and languages were banned and the usual regime of physical and emotional abuse was upheld by the various monks , nuns and priests who ran these hell holes ?
These recent news stories show that the Catholic Church remains a deeply dysfunctional organisation and that no child can ever feel safe in its “ care ” .

The first is about what I still hold on to .
I came up in the " conscious " community , and the one value that the Babas and Mamas taught me , that I hold with me to this day , is the sanctity of the relationship between the elders and the young , the sense that the elder does n't exist to simply cosign the emotions of the young , he exists to push the young past that , to challenge them , to force them to be better despite themselves .
The whole notion of " It takes a village " was pushed by the conscious community .
That idea has been wailed upon by people who do n't know what the fuck their talking about , who 've never sat on a stoop in a ghetto , who file reports and columns about people who are Martians to them .
At its core , it simply means caring about people who are younger than you , in the way that you care about your child .
I get the conservative critique of that ideal - - it 's certainly Utopian , but no more so than , say , " love thy neighbor . "
My interpretation ( others may not share it ) of the " It take a village " mantra would have called on West to pull up Mos Def , as opposed to making excuses for why he would think that way .
The other thing I learned in the conscious community was the value of critical thinking .
The idea was that you live in a world where the Tuskegee experiments actually happened , where the FBI did plot to destroy the Panthers , where J. Edgar Hoover terrorized black leaders from Garvey to Huey Newton .
In that vein , you should be skeptical of what you see and hear .
This is the perspective Mos is coming from .
( Note the Assata reference . )
But here 's the thing -- if you really get that message , it ultimately leads you to be critical , not just of the larger white narrative , but of the narrative put forth by those around you .
So here 's the deal -- I was a history major at Howard University .
I came to that school believing very much in an Afrocentric view of history .
From that perspective , my first semester was just devastating .
I had a professor , Dr. Linda Heywood , who specialized in taking on kids like me ( the ones who believed ancient Egypt built fighter jets ) and forcing us to face facts .
She was , of course , a trained historian who was used to debating kids like me , and for every Chancellor Williams or Diop I whipped out , she had a David Brion Davis or a Eugene Genovese .
I could n't escape by dismissing her as part of a white plot -- she was not just a black woman , but a black woman with a PhD in African History , who was teaching at the most storied black university in the country .
I could n't attack her street cred , and so I had to engage the argument .
I found her infuriating -- which led me to take two more classes from her .
A buddy of mine recalls the most poignant moment for us under her tutelage .
At the end of a particularly debilitating lecture , she looked at us and said , " So with all the evidence I 've given you , explain to me why blacks are not inferior to whites . "
ENJOYING a leisurely meal or just getting enough sleep can seem like luxuries .
But not so in France , where people spend more time dining , imbibing and snoozing than anywhere else in the mostly - rich countries of the OECD .
Americans also get a lot of shut - eye , but ( fond of fast food ) probably suffer indigestion along with neighbouring Mexicans and Canadians .
South Koreans and Japanese reportedly survive on an hour 's less sleep than the French .

To the consternation of Republicans and the media – including CBS News and The Politico among other who have gleefully ran what sounds like something directly written from an RNC PR release – Democrats claim CIA out to get them .
Democrats , also continue drive the media and Conservatives crazy by refusing to play good little lap dog .
Now Republicans like cry - me - a- river baby House minority leader Republican Rep. John Boehner are f reigning some outrage – how dare Democrats question the word of the CIA , Rep .
Boehner : Now and Then
John Boehner Now John Boehner : “ I ’ve dealt with our intelligence professionals for the last three - and - a - half years on an almost daily basis , and it ’s hard for me to imagine that our intelligence area would ever mislead a member of Congress .
[ Boehner Press Availability via The Hill , 5/14/2009 ] John Boehner Then : December 9 , 2007 : Wolf Blitzer : “ Are you suggesting , as I think you are , that you do n’t necessarily have confidence in this new NIE ? ” ( NIE - the CIA ’s national Intelligence Estimate ) Rep. John Boehner : “ Either I do n’t have confidence in what they told me several months ago or I do n’t have confidence in what they ’re telling me today . ”
[ CNN , Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer , 12/9/2007 ; emphasis added ]
It was literally just a few months ago that Republicans were point blank accusing the CIA of being out to get them and Bush .
The editors at the far right National Review , CIA Run Amok , May 8 , 2006
The reasons for Porter Goss ’s abrupt departure as CIA director are shrouded in mystery .
But its effect is not .
It gives the impression that there has been a coup by the CIA insiders who have waged a covert policy war against the Bush administration for five years .
The White House must act quickly to correct the impression that the renegades have won . [ ].. During the Bush presidency , however , the agency has not been content with subtly pushing its own agenda while underperforming its nominal mission .
It has run amok .
In fact , it worked assiduously — though unsuccessfully — to depose the administration in the 2004 election , and since then has continued brazenly undermining Bush ’s foreign policy .
In a post by a far right Conservative blog called the Strata - Sphere , Rogue CIA Fires Back ?
May2 , 2006 that engaged in some wild speculation of the motivations by the CIA in the investigation in the Rep Randy Cunningham ’s ( R ) bribery scandal and echoing the thoughts of Drudge and a rabid right blogger called Macsmind , wrote ,
Mac Ranger predicted the roque CIA agents trying to destroy this country through leaks would create some bizarre news .
Sometimes we need to spell things out for the liberal puppets on the left , so I must point out again that the tools available to the CIA to gather information illegally and use it against people can be used by more than the President . [ ].. The news that ex-CIA agents are talking to ABC News about an investigation into links between CIA contracts and Rep Randy Cunningham ’s ( R ) bribery acts leads me to believe Cunningham may have been outed by some ex-CIA agents to send a message to the Reps and Bush .
John ( AssRocket ) at Powerline ( once Time magazine ’s blog of the year ) wrote The CIA Comes Out of the Closet , September 7 , 2004 Posted by John
Many people are unaware that the CIA is , and always has been , a liberal organization , its ranks dominated by Democrats . [ ].. The CIA ’s liberal orientation has been painfully evident over the last four years , as the agency has engaged in a virtual war with the Bush administration ; its officials have been available 24/7 for anti-Bush leaks to the New York Times and the Washington Post .
Many of these Republican editorials are are fact free , never the less , the accusations that the CIA was a far left organization out to get Republicans and Bush in particular were a common theme as late as recently as last year .
Stephen F. Hayes who was a political consultant to the Bush 43 administration in a column for neocon Bill Kristals Weeekly Standard , Paul Pillar Speaks , Again – The latest CIA attack on the Bush administration is nothing new ( 02/10/2006 ) ( Linked to by multiple right - wing sites )
Think about that : A senior , unelected CIA official –Paul Pillar–was given agency approval to anonymously attack Bush administration policies less than two months before the November 2 , 2004 , presidential election .
That Pillar was among the most strident of these frequent critics–usually in off - the - record speeches to gatherings of foreign policy experts and business leaders –was well known to his colleagues in the intelligence community and to Bush administration policymakers .
His was not an isolated case ; CIA officials routinely trashed Bush administration policy decisions , often with official approval , in the months leading up to the Iraq War and again before the election .
Pillar , who had complained to a CIA spokesman that someone had violated the ground rules by providing his name to Novak , simply got caught .
Pretty much standard rhetoric from the Right when it became known that Bush and surrogates such as Hayes told lies repeatedly in defense of lies about Iraq intelligence , WMD and non-existent al - Queda connections .
The anti-Bush CIA was out to get the neocons .
Hayes was and as far as I know continues to defend the Bush administration ’s occupation of Iraq in 2003 as a could n’t - wait - considering - the - urgent threat cheerleaders .
laughable now to most Americans in hindsight , but a commonly repeated bit of propaganda at the time .
Neocon and plagiarist of fascist writers , Michael Ledeen at The National Review , Sixteen Words , Again
The myth of a great sin lives on , April 10 , 2006 ( again , linked to with great approval by multiple right - wing outlets )
The consensus at CIA was highly critical of these reports ( most CIA officials were against the war and did n’t want to be blamed for it ) , but the White House , understandably very suspicious of the quality of CIA ’s information and analysis , had pushed hard to get more information .
The Bush administration was using torture to produce false links between Iraq and al - Queda , thus Leeden and the Right accused anyone up to and including the CIA of being pro-terrorist .
Leeden also managed , in the same column , to mangle and lie about every known fact concerning Joseph Wilson and the Niger yelllow - cake claims in one of the Right ’s lamest attempts to smear Wilson and the CIA .
He even gives more credit to some iffy French intelligence service reports then the CIA .
John McCain ( R - AZ ) , who was against water boarding before he was for it is often given credit from moderates or condemnation from the freeper crowd for the charade known as the Detainee Treatment Act ( which Bush promptly arranged a photo - op then ignored via yet another signing statement ) also thought the CIA was out to undermine the neocon agenda ,
“ McCain would be an absolute disaster , ” says a second recently retired senior US intelligence operations officer .
“ He is prejudiced against the CIA .
The day after the 2004 election when Bush won , McCain came on TV and gave an interview in which he said something to the effect of , ‘ The CIA tried to sabotage this election .
They ’ve made their bed and now they have to lay in it . ‘
I used to like McCain , but he is inconsistent . ”
Columnist Robert Novak quoted McCain in November 2004 as saying , “ With CIA leaks intended to harm the re-election campaign of the president of the United States , it is not only dysfunctional but a rogue organization . ”
McCain is influenced by a circle of hardline Republican legislators and congressional staff as well as disgruntled former Agency officials “ who all had these long - standing grudges against people in the Agency , ” the former senior intelligence officer said .
“ They think the CIA is a hotbed of liberals .
Right - wing , nutty paranoia stuff .
They all love the military and hate the CIA .
Because the CIA tells them stuff they do n’t want to hear . ”
Many in the media want to portray Democrats as paranoid .
If they keep at and cross their fingers and hope that most American ’s memory is as long and credible as John Boehner ’s that tactic may work .
On the other hand if anyone in the media wants to use Lexus - Nexus or Google for fifteen minutes they ’ll find that until recently as far as most Republicans were concerned the CIA were all radical leftists out to get them .
This year ’s fashions have changed .
Now that the CIA has issued some memos gathered from from memories of some nameless faceless sources , it is Democrats who are allegedly paranoid .
The CIA is in many ways like a large corporation that employs thousands of people whose personal politics vary as much as any work place .
There are probably factions within department and the entire agency that differ in opinion about how things should be run .
Now , one gets the impression that more then a political left - right agenda they ’re probably just looking out for their own , much like large police departments are known to have tense relationships with their internal affairs departments .
A Truth Commission in which the CIA , former Bush officials including Bush and Cheney , and even Speaker Pelosi and former Senator Bob Graham – all under oath .
Then let the truth fall where it may , but that is exactly what the former Republican CIA haters do not want , thus the continuing battle of media sound bites and editorials rather then testimony ,
“ What struck me ( former Senator Graham ) … was the fact that in that briefing , there were also two staff members , ” he said .
“ As you know , the general rule is that the executive is to brief the full committees of the House and Senate Intelligence committees about any ongoing or proposed action .
The exception to that is what is called “ covert action , ” where the president … only briefs the Gang of Eight , which is the four congressional leaders and the four intelligence committee leaders .
Those sessions are generally conducted at an executive site , primarily at the White House itself .
And they are conducted with just the authorized personnel , not with any staff or any other member of the committee … .
Which leads me to conclude that this was not considered by the CIA to be a Gang of Eight briefing .
Otherwise they would not have had staff in the room .
And that leads me to then believe that they did n’t brief us on any of the sensitive programs such as the waterboarding or other forms of excessive interrogation . ”
The remarks made by Graham bolster the comments offered by Pelosi on Thursday .
The Speaker told reporters that during her briefing session in the fall of 2002 she was not just kept in the dark about the issue of waterboarding , she was assured that it had not been used .
“ Yes , I am saying that the CIA was misleading the Congress , ” she said .
The decider clown
Apparently , Rush Limbaugh now wants the Republican party to fail too .
The GOP meltdown continues .
Earlier today , Joe reported that the head of the Republican party , Michael Steele , called comedian Rush Limbaugh “ incendiary ” and “ ugly . ”
Well , Limbaugh struck back today on his radio show .
It looks like Limbaugh called on Republicans to stop donating to the Republican party .
It seems to me that it ’s Michael Steele who is off to a shaky start … .
Now , Mr. Steele , if it is your position as the chairman of the Republican National Committee that you want a left wing Democrat president and a left wing Democrat Congress to succeed in advancing their agenda , if it ’s your position that you want President Obama and Speaker Pelosi and Senate leader Harry Reid to succeed with their massive spending and taxing and nationalization plans , I think you have some explaining to do .
Why are you running the Republican Party ?
Why do you claim you lead the Republican Party when you seem obsessed with seeing to it that President Obama succeeds ?
I frankly am stunned that the chairman of the Republican National Committee endorses such an agenda …
I do n’t understand why you ’re asking Republicans to donate to the Republican National Committee if their money is going to be spent furthering the agenda of Barack Obama ?
If we do n’t want Obama and Reid and Pelosi to fail , then why does the RNC exist , Mr. Steele ?
Why are you even raising money ?…

Brown , at the age of 16 , became the first male artist to have his debut single top the Billboard Hot 100 .
At the same time , millions of Gen Yers flocked to their favorite torrent sites to download his work ( yet he still managed to sell over 2 million copies of his debut album ) .
Then the RIAA slapped many of those same Millennials with lawsuits ( the RIAA has allegedly settled with 30,000 people that they ’ve sued over illegal downloading ) .
What I find sad , is that these “ brands ” are both setting horrible examples for malleable , young minds .
Chris Brown just Chris Brown just pleaded guilty to beating up his girlfriend Rihanna , and was only given 180 days of community labor and 5 years of probation .

Illegally downloading 24 songs is worse than domestic violence .
I am sorry , but this is absurd .
The RIAA is a business that represents the record labels that employ the recording artists .
Instead of spending time and money to publicize the very real issue of domestic violence in an effort to condemn Chris Brown ’s actions , they took the people that downloaded his music to court and profited from it .
Unforgivable .
In my business law class , my prof pounded two things into my head : a business has fiduciary and ethical duties .
Businesses have a duty to accurately report their finances and to conduct their business in an ethical manner .
I ’m sorry , but there is nothing ethical about the way the RIAA is conducting their business , especially since they are an industry leader ( they represent 85 % of all distributors and labels in the US ) .
If we Millennials are going to be the leaders of tomorrow , then how about setting a good example for us on how to run a business ?
Huh RIAA , is that too much to ask ?
If the very artists that you represent are speaking out against your disdainful sue - and - scare profiteering (
If we Millennials are going to be the leaders of tomorrow , then how about setting a good example for us on how to run a business ?
Huh RIAA , is that too much to ask ?
If the very artists that you represent are speaking out against your disdainful sue - and - scare profiteering ( Radiohead , Moby , etc. ) , is n’t it time for a change ?

A man who had a tracking bracelet attached to his ankle after getting busted for marijuana possession outwitted the cops in one simple way : he had a fake leg .
Oh , cops .

Bret Ravenhill , the Brit who had gotten busted for cannabis possession , was on probation to keep him from going out of his house at night .
Unfortunately , the security officer who affixed the tag failed to pull his pant leg up or sock down , not noticing that the leg was made of metal .
Ravenhill claims that he never broke his curfew , but there 's no real way for anyone to know that , is there ?
In any case , score one for amputee potheads , right ?

Avsim was one of the largest sites serving the flight sim community Flight simulator site Avsim has been " destroyed " by malicious hackers .
The site , which launched in 1996 , covered all aspects of flight simulation , although its main focus was on Microsoft 's Flight Simulator .
The attack took down the site 's two servers and the owners had not established an external backup system .
The site 's founder , Tom Allensworth , said that the site would be down for the foreseeable future and was unsure if it would ever go back up .
" The method of the hack makes recovery difficult , if not impossible , to recover from , " Mr Allensworth said in a statement .
" AVSIM is totally offline at this time and we expect to be so for some time to come .
We are not able to predict when we will be back online , if we can come back at all .
" Backlash
The attack has shocked the flight sim community , with hundreds of blogs , posts and tweets .
One user on the simflight.com website said that " there 's a special place in hell for hackers who pull stunts like this " .
Speaking to the BBC , Derek Davis , editor of PC Pilot magazine , said : " It looks like 13 years of hard work on Tom 's part could have been wiped out .
" Avsim is an important site , because it services the whole community as a source of community developed terrains , skins , and mods - its contribution has been immeasurable , " he said .
Mr Allensworth has set up a temporary forum for Avsim users while the future of the site is decided .
On it , he explained the site 's backing - up process , although he did not explain why the firm had no external media storage .
" Some have asked whether or not we had back - ups .
Yes , we dutifully backed up our servers every day .
Unfortunately , we backed up the servers between our two servers .
" The hacker took out both servers , destroying our ability to use one or the other back - up to remedy the situation . "
Mr Davis said he thought the site still had a future : " I 'm sure Avsim will rise like a phoenix from the ashes and will be bigger and better than before . "

THE PRESIDENT : We set out a goal in my speech to the joint session that said everybody should have at least one year of post - high - school training .
And I think it would be too rigid to say everybody needs a four - year - college degree .
I think everybody needs enough post - high - school training that they are competent in fields that require technical expertise , because it ’s very hard to imagine getting a job that pays a living wage without that — or it ’s very hard at least to envision a steady job in the absence of that .
And so to the extent that we can upgrade not only our high schools but also our community colleges to provide a sound technical basis for being able to perform complicated tasks in a 21st - century economy , then I think that not only is that good for the individuals , but that ’s going to be critical for the economy as a whole .
I want to emphasize , though , that part of the challenge is making sure that folks are getting in high school what they need as well .
You know , I use my grandmother as an example for a lot of things , but I think this is telling .
My grandmother never got a college degree .
She went to high school .
Unlike my grandfather , she did n’t benefit from the G.I.
Bill , even though she worked on a bomber assembly line .
She went to work as a secretary .
But she was able to become a vice president at a bank partly because her high - school education was rigorous enough that she could communicate and analyze information in a way that , frankly , a bunch of college kids in many parts of the country can’t .
She could write —
Today , you mean ?
THE PRESIDENT : Today .
She could write a better letter than many of my — I wo n’t say “ many , ” but a number of my former students at the University of Chicago Law School .
So part of the function of a high - school degree or a community - college degree is credentialing , right ?
It allows employers in a quick way to sort through who ’s got the skills and who does n’t .
But part of the problem that we ’ve got right now is that what it means to have graduated from high school , what it means to have graduated from a two - year college or a four - year college is not always as clear as it was several years ago .
And that means that we ’ve got to — in our education - reform agenda — we ’ve got to focus not just on increasing graduation rates , but we ’ve also got to make what ’s learned in the high - school and college experience more robust and more effective .
I was in West Virginia recently talking to some college students , and these are kids in college , fully intending to graduate , and yet they were still telling me they ’re not sure whether a college education is worth it .
They ’re going to be graduating in a recession .
They ’re worried their jobs will go to China .
You hear these things all the time .
What would you say — there are a large number of very thoughtful people who have those concerns — what would you say to them ?
THE PRESIDENT : Well , look , I ’d start off by saying just look at the statistics .
The unemployment rate for high - school graduates is at least three times what it is for a college graduate .
So it ’s true that in this recession you ’re seeing white - collar jobs impacted .
Even before the recession , it ’s true that you saw some outsourcing of white - collar jobs .
But if you ’re working the odds , your likelihood of getting a job that pays you a good , solid middle - class wage is vastly increased upon graduating from college — unless you ’re LeBron James .
And so I think the evidence ( 3 ) speaks for itself .
HELSINKI ( Reuters ) - Pollution is killing the Baltic Sea and coastal states must mount an urgent salvage operation , Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen said Tuesday .
Finland 's Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen holds a news conference after an emergency European Union leaders summit in Brussels March 1 , 2009 .

“ The state of the sea is alarming , ” Vanhanen told a meeting of the 47 - nation Council of Europe parliamentary assembly in Helsinki .
“ It is , in fact , suffering a slow death -- unless we do something , fast .
There is a vicious circle that we need to break .
We must join forces in a joint salvage operation of the Baltic . ”
The Baltic has suffered from decades of pollution , largely from the former Soviet Union .
Rivers still bring in chemical pollutants , including from agriculture , that cause blooms of algae that choke marine life .
Vanhanen said Finland would host a Baltic summit in February 2010 to try to clean up the almost land - locked sea and find ways to boost the regional economy .
“ We need joint decisions to cut pollution caused by homes , industry and agriculture to the minimum , ” he told delegates .
The Baltic is bordered by Russia , Germany , Poland , Sweden , Denmark , Lithuania , Latvia , Estonia and Finland .
Vanhanen said rising ship traffic was among problems .
“ The increasing numbers of vessels in maritime transport , especially oil and chemical tankers but also passenger ships , require enhanced measures in maritime safety and preventing accidents , ” he said .
Vanhanen ’s gloom about the Baltic contrasts with some reports that have noted a slight improvement in the state of the sea .
An existing Baltic Sea action plan aims to restore the sea to health by 2021 .
“ The Baltic remains in a bad shape , but there are some signs of improvement , ” a report by the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission said in March .

He said : “ With hindsight of course I would have acted differently on these items but as a new MP , with a Green Book that was full of subjective rules and a guidance team that knew the limits for items , but chose not to share them with MPs , it was inevitable that almost every MP would have items questioned at some point . ”

Cosmic - rays detected half a mile underground in a disused U.S. iron - mine can be used to detect major weather events occurring 20 miles up in the Earth ’s upper atmosphere , a new study has revealed .
Published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters and led by scientists from the UK’s National Centre for Atmospheric Science ( NCAS ) and the Science and Technology Facilities Council ( STFC ) , this remarkable study shows how the number of high - energy cosmic - rays reaching a detector deep underground , closely matches temperature measurements in the upper atmosphere ( known as the stratosphere ) .
For the first time , scientists have shown how this relationship can be used to identify weather events that occur very suddenly in the stratosphere during the Northern Hemisphere winter .
These events can have a significant effect on the severity of winters we experience , and also on the amount of ozone over the poles - being able to identify them and understand their frequency is crucial for informing our current climate and weather - forecasting models to improve predictions .
Working in collaboration with a major U.S. - led particle physics experiment called MINOS ( managed by the U.S. Department of Energy 's Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory ) , the scientists analysed a four - year record of cosmic - ray data detected in a disused iron - mine in the U.S. state of Minnesota .
What they observed was a strikingly close relationship between the cosmic - rays and stratospheric temperature - this they could understand : the cosmic - rays , known as muons are produced following the decay of other cosmic rays , known as mesons .
Increasing the temperature of the atmosphere expands the atmosphere so that fewer mesons are destroyed on impact with air , leaving more to decay naturally to muons .
Consequently , if temperature increases so does the number of muons detected .
What did surprise the scientists , however , were the intermittent and sudden increases observed in the levels of muons during the winter months .
These jumps in the data occurred over just a few days .
On investigation , they found these changes coincided with very sudden increases in the temperature of the stratosphere ( by up to 40 deg C in places ! ) .
Looking more closely at supporting meteorological data , they realised they were observing a major weather event , known as a Sudden Stratospheric Warming .
On average , these occur every other year and are notoriously unpredictable .
This study has shown , for the first time , that cosmic - ray data can be used effectively to identify these events .
Lead scientist for the National Centre for Atmospheric Science , Dr Scott Osprey said : “ Up until now we have relied on weather balloons and satellite data to provide information about these major weather events .
Now we can potentially use records of cosmic - ray data dating back 50 years to give us a pretty accurate idea of what was happening to the temperature in the stratosphere over this time .
Looking forward , data being collected by other large underground detectors around the world , can also be used to study this phenomenon . ”
Dr Giles Barr , co-author of the study from the University of Oxford added : “ It 's fun sitting half a mile underground doing particle physics .
It 's even better to know that from down there , we can also monitor a part of the atmosphere that is otherwise quite tricky to measure ” .
Interestingly , the muon cosmic - ray dataset used in this study was collected as a by - product of the MINOS experiment , which is designed to investigate properties of neutrinos , but which also measures muons originating high up in the atmosphere , as background noise in the detector .
Having access to these data has led to the production of a valuable dataset of benefit to climate researchers .
Professor Jenny Thomas , deputy spokesperson for MINOS from University College London said “ The question we set out to answer at MINOS is to do with the basic properties of fundamental particles called neutrinos which is a crucial ingredient in our current model of the Universe , but as is often the way , by keeping an open mind about the data collected , the science team has been able to find another , unanticipated benefit that aids our understanding of weather and climate phenomena . ”
Dr Osprey commented : “ This study is a great example of what can be done through international partnerships and cross- disciplinary research .
One can only guess what other secrets are waiting to be revealed . ”
Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani was a last - minute no - show at the wedding of his former roommates — a gay couple — yesterday .
It was a disappointment for Queens car dealer Howard Koeppel and his longtime lover , Mark Hsiao , who tied the knot in a double - ring ceremony before 10 guests in Westport , Conn .
The couple famously let the ex-mayor crash at their luxury $ 2.37 million three - bedroom Manhattan apartment while he was going through a nasty divorce with Donna Hanover in 2001 .
Later , Giuliani married the “ other woman , ” Judith Nathan .
“ Rudy and Judith were both invited with a beautiful written invitation by mail , ” said Koeppel .
“ His secretary called Thursday and said he was not able to come to the wedding and wished us all the best . ”
Koeppel once quipped that Giuliani was a perfect roommate who “ always made his bed ” and “ called me mother . ”
At the time , Giuliani ducked the question about whether living with a gay couple had changed his longstanding opposition to gay marriage .
“ I do n’t relate to people as white , black , Catholic , Protestant , Jewish , gay , lesbian , heterosexual , ” the then - mayor told reporters at Gracie Mansion .
Giuliani has stated he has no problem with civil unions but told The Post he ’d speak out against gay marriage if he runs for governor .
Connecticut in November allowed gays to marry .
" History is affected by discoveries we will make in the future " - Popper
On the evening of Friday , 25 October 1946 the Cambridge Moral Science Club - a weekly discussion group for the university 's philosophers and philosophy students - held one of its regular meetings .
As usual , the members assembled in King 's College at 8.30 , in a set of rooms in the Gibbs Building - number 3 on staircase H .
That evening the guest speaker was Dr Karl Popper , down from London to deliver an innocuous - sounding paper , ' Are There Philosophical Problems ? ' .
Among his audience was the chairman of the club , Professor Ludwig Wittgenstein , considered by many to be the most brilliant philosopher of his time .
Also present was Bertrand Russell , who for decades had been a household name as a philosopher and radical campaigner .
Popper had recently been appointed to the position of Reader in Logic and Scientific Method at the London School of Economics .
He came from an Austrian - Jewish background and was newly arrived in Britain , having spent the war years lecturing in New Zealand .
7We Open Society and Its Enemies , his remorseless demolition of totalitarianism , which he had begun on the day Nazi troops entered Austria and completed as the tide of war turned , had just been published in England .
It had immediately won him a select group of admirers - among them Bertrand Russell .
This was the only time these three great philosophers - Russell , Wittgenstein and Popper - were together .
Yet , to this day , no one can agree precisely what took place .
What is clear is that there were vehement exchanges between Popper and Wittgenstein over the fundamental nature of philosophy - whether there were indeed philosophical problems ( Popper ) or merely puzzles ( Wittgenstein ) .
These exchanges instantly became the stuff of legend .
An early version of events had Popper and Wittgenstein battling for supremacy with red - hot pokers .
As Popper himself later recollected , ' In a surprisingly short time I received a letter from New Zealand asking if it was true that Wittgenstein and I had come to blows , both armed with pokers . '
Those ten or so minutes on 25 October 1946 still provoke bitter disagreement .
Above all , one dispute remains heatedly alive : did Karl Popper later publish an untrue version of what happened ?
Did he lie ?
If he did lie , it was no casual embellishing of the facts .
If he lied , it directly concerned two ambitions central to his life : the defeat at a theoretical level of fashionable twentieth - century linguistic philosophy and triumph at a personal level over Wittgenstein , the sorcerer who had dogged his career .
Popper 's account can be found in his intellectual autobiography , Unended Quest , published in 1974 .
According to this version of events , Popper put forward a series of what he insisted were real philosophical problems .
Wittgenstein summarily dismissed them all .
Popper recalled that Wittgenstein ' had been nervously playing with the poker ' , which he used ' like a conductor 's baton to emphasize his assertions ' , and when a question came up about the status of ethics , Wittgenstein challenged him to give an example of a moral rule .
' I replied : " Not to threaten visiting lecturers with pokers . "
Whereupon Wittgenstein , in a rage , threw the poker down and stormed out of the room , banging the door behind him . '
When Popper died , in 1994 , newspaper obituarists picked up his telling of the tale and repeated it word for word ( including the wrong date for the meeting - the 26th , not the 25th . )
Then , some three years after Popper 's death , a memoir published in the proceedings of one of Britain 's most learned bodies , the British Academy , recounted essentially the same sequence of events .
It brought down a storm of protest on the head of the author , Popper 's successor at the LSE , Professor John Watkins , and sparked off an acerbic exchange of letters in the pages of the London Times Literary Supplement .
A fervent Wittgenstein supporter who had taken part in the meeting , Professor Peter Geach , denounced Popper 's account of the meeting as ' false from beginning to end ' .
It was not the first time Professor Geach had made that allegation .
A robust correspondence followed as other witnesses or later supporters of the protagonists piled into the fray .
There was a delightful irony in the conflicting testimonies .
They had arisen between people all professionally concerned with theories of epistemology ( the grounds of knowledge ) , understanding and truth .
Yet they concerned a sequence of events where those who disagreed were eyewitnesses on crucial questions of fact .
This tale has also gripped the imagination of many writers : no biography , philosophical account or novel involving either man seems complete without a - frequently colourful - version .
It has achieved the status , if not of an urban myth , then at least of an ivory - tower fable .
But why was there such anger over what took place more than half a century before , in a small room , at a regular meeting of an obscure university club , during an argument over an arcane topic ?
Memories of the evening had remained fresh through the decades , persisting not over a complex philosophical theory or a clash of ideologies , but over a quip and the waving - or otherwise - of a short metal rod .
What do the incident and its aftermath tell us about Wittgenstein and Popper , their remarkable personalities , their relationship and their beliefs ?
How significant was it that they both came from fin - de - siecle Vienna , both born into assimilated Jewish families , but with a great gulf of wealth and influence between them ?
And what about the crux of the evening 's debate : the philosophical divide ?
Wittgenstein and Popper had a profound influence on the way we address the fundamental issues of civilization , science and culture .
Between them , they made pivotal contributions both to age - old problems such as what we can be said to know , how we can make advances in our knowledge , and how we should be governed , and to contemporary puzzles about the limits of language and sense , and what lies beyond those limits .
Each man believed that he had freed philosophy from the mistakes of its past , and that he carried responsibility for its future .
Popper saw Wittgenstein as philosophy 's ultimate enemy .
Yet the story of the poker goes beyond the characters and beliefs of the antagonists .
It is inseparable from the story of their times , opening a window on the tumultuous and tragic history which shaped their lives and brought them together in Cambridge .
And it is the story of the schism in twentieth century philosophy over the significance of language : a division between those who diagnosed traditional philosophical problems as purely linguistic entanglements and those who believed that these problems transcended language .
In the end , of course , it is the story of a linguistic puzzle in itself : to whom did Popper utter what words in that room full of witnesses , and why ?
Before we begin to delve into the personalities , the history and the philosophy of those ten minutes in H3 , let us introduce what are fixed and ascertainable : the place , the witnesses and their avowed recollections .
Memories Are Made of This
Memory : ' I see us still , sitting at that table . '
But have 1 really the same visual image - or one of those that I had then ?
Do I also certainly see the table and my friend from the same point of view as then , and not see myself ?
- Wittgenstein
The Gibbs Building of King 's College is a massive , severely classical block , constructed of white Portland stone .
It was designed in 1723 by James Gibbs , who was the college 's second choice : the initial plan , by Nicholas Hawksmoor , one of the premier architects of the day , was too expensive , and the building 's remarkable and much praised restraint in decoration was the result of King 's being short of money .
Viewed from the street , King 's Parade , H3 is on the right - hand side of the building , on the first floor .
The echoing approach , up a flight of uncarpeted stone steps past bare walls , is chill and uninviting .
The double front door leads directly into the sitting room .
Two long windows with window seats overlook the spacious elegance of the college front court and , filling the view to the left , Henry VI 's great limestone chapel , a supreme example of perpendicular architecture .
In the silence of an October evening , the singing of King 's celebrated choir will break in on donnish concentration .
The feature of H3 at the heart of this decades - long quarrel , the fireplace , is enclosed by a marble surround above which is a carved wooden mantelpiece .
It is a small , black , iron affair - more The Road to Wigan Pier than Brideshead Revisited .
To its right are the doors to two smaller rooms .
With views over the big lawn sweeping down to the river Cam , at the time of the meeting they were a kitchen and bedroom , although they have since been converted into studies .
In those days and for some years after , most members of Cambridge colleges - undergraduates and fellows alike - were expected to dart in their dressing gowns across the courts to a communal bathroom .
In 1946 the splendour of the Gibbs Building 's exterior was not reflected in the state of its rooms .
This was barely a year after the end of the Second World War .
Blackout curtains were still hanging - a reminder of the Luftwaffe 's recent threat .
Paintwork was chipped and grimy , the walls in urgent need of a wash .
Although its tenant was a don , Richard Braithwaite , H3 was just as neglected as the other rooms in the building , squalid , dusty and dirty .
Heating was dependent on open fires - central heating and baths were not installed until after the ultra - severe winter of 1947 , when even the water that collected in the gas pipes froze , blocking them and the inhabitants protected their clothes with their gowns when humping sacks of coal .
Normally , despite the eminence of many of the speakers , only fifteen or so people would turn up to the Moral Science Club ; significantly , for Dr Popper there were perhaps double that number .
The medley of undergraduates , graduates and dons squeezed into whatever space they could find .
Most of those who had been at Wittgenstein 's late - afternoon seminar , held in his barely furnished rooms at the top of a tower of Whewell 's Court - across the street from the great gate of Trinity College , where he held a fellowship - rejoined him in King's .
Conducted twice weekly , these seminars offered students a mesmerizing experience .
As Wittgenstein struggled with a thought there would be a long moment of agonized silence ; then , when the thought was formed , a sudden burst of ferocious energy .
Permission was granted for students to attend - but on condition that they were not there merely as ' tourists ' .
On the afternoon Of 25 October an Indian graduate , Kanti Shah , took notes .
What did it mean , Wittgenstein wanted to know , to speak to oneself ?
' Is this something fainter than speaking ?
Is it like comparing 2+2=4 on dirty paper with 2+2=4 on clean paper ? '
One student suggested a comparison with a ' bell dying away so that one does n't know if one imagines or hears it ' .
Wittgenstein was unimpressed .
Meanwhile , in Trinity College itself , in a room once occupied by Sir Isaac Newton , Popper and Russell were drinking China tea with lemon and eating biscuits .
On this chilly day , both would have had reason to be grateful for the draught excluders newly placed around the windows .
It is not known what they talked about , though one account has them plotting against Wittgenstein .
Happily , philosophy appears good for longevity : of the thirty present that night , nine , now in their seventies or eighties , responded by letter , phone and , above all , e-mail from across the globe - from England , France , Austria , the United States and New Zealand - to appeals for memories of that evening .
Their ranks include a former English High Court judge , Sir John Vinelott , famous both for the quiet voice with which he spoke in court and for the sharpness with which he responded to counsel who asked him to speak up .
There are five professors .
Professor Peter Munz had come to St John 's from New Zealand and returned home to become a notable academic .
His book Our Knowledge of the Searchfor Knowledge opened with the poker incident : it was , he wrote , a ' symbolic and in hindsight prophetic ' watershed in twentieth - century philosophy .
Professor Stephen Toulmin is an eminent philosopher of widely ranging interests who spent the latter part of his academic career teaching at universities in the United States .
He wrote such leading works as The Uses of Argument , and is co-author of a demanding revisionist text on Wittgenstein , placing his philosophy in the context of Viennese culture and fin de siecle intellectual ferment .
As a young King 's research fellow , he turned down a post as assistant to Karl Popper .
Professor Peter Geach , an authority on logic and the German logician Gottlob Frege ( among many other things ) , lectured at the University of Birmingham , and then at Leeds .
Professor Michael Wolff specialized in Victorian England , and his academic career took him to posts at Indiana University and the University of Massachusetts .
Professor Georg Kreisel , a brilliant mathematician , taught at Stanford ; Wittgenstein had declared him the most able philosopher he had ever met who was also a mathematician .
Peter Gray - Lucas became an academic and then switched to business , first in steel , then photographic film , then papermaking .
Stephen Plaister , who was married in the freezing winter Of 1947 , became a prep- school master , teaching classics .
Wasfi Hijab deserves a special mention .
He was the secretary of the Moral Science Club at the time of the fateful meeting .
No real prestige was attached to the position , he says .
He cannot even remember how he came to hold it - probably a case of Buggins 's turn .
His job as secretary was to fix the agenda for the term , which he would do after consulting with members of the faculty .
In his period of office he succeeded in persuading not just Popper to travel to Cambridge , but also the man who brought the news of logical positivism from Vienna to England , A. J. Ayer .
Ayer always found it an ' ordeal ' to speak in front of Wittgenstein , but nevertheless replied to Hijab 's invitation by saying that he would gladly talk to the society , even though in his opinion ' Cambridge philosophy was rich in technique but poor in substance . '
' That ' , says Hijab , ' shows how much he knew . '
Hijab's Cambridge experience says much about Wittgenstein .
He had arrived in Cambridge in 1945 on a scholarship from Jerusalem , where he had taught mathematics in a secondary school .
His goal was to switch disciplines by studying for a doctorate in philosophy .
Three years later he left with his Ph.D. unfinished .
He had made a mistake fatal to his ambitions : against all advice - from Richard Braithwaite among others - he had asked Wittgenstein to be .
his supervisor .
To general astonishment Wittgenstein had agreed .
Hijab remembers his tutorials well .
They were , when weather permitted , ambulatory .
Round and round the manicured Trinity fellows ' garden they would walk : he , Wittgenstein and a fellow student Elizabeth Anscombe , deep in discussion of the philosophy of religion .
' If you want to know whether a man is religious , do n't ask him , observe him , ' said Wittgenstein .
In his supervisor 's presence Hijab was mostly struck dumb with sheer terror ; in his absence , he says , he sometimes demonstrated he was catching a spark off the old master .
Wittgenstein , Hijab now reflects , destroyed his intellectual foundations , his religious faith and his powers of abstract thought .
The doctorate abandoned , for many years after leaving Cambridge he put all thought of philosophy aside and took up mathematics again .
Wittgenstein , he says , was ' like an atomic bomb , a tornado - people just do n't appreciate that '.
Nevertheless ,
Hijab retains that fierce loyalty to his teacher that Wittgenstein could inspire .
' People often say that all philosophy is just a footnote to Plato , ' Hijab says , ' but they should add , " until Wittgenstein " . '
His devotion finally had its reward .
In 1999 he caused a sensation at a Wittgenstein conference in Austria when he more or less gatecrashed the programme , but was then given two extra sessions for his discourses on the master , meriting a write - up in the ultra-serious Neue Zurcher Zeitung .
From Austria , Hijab moved on to the Wittgenstein Archive in Cambridge , to hold seminars there .
It took him , he said , half a century to recover from his ' over - exposure ' to Wittgenstein .
Now he wanted to make up for lost time .
For the full story of the confrontation between Wittgenstein and Popper we must wait until all the evidence is in .
But there can be no better place to start than with our eyewitnesses .
Conventionally , we should feel a chill in the air as a glance around the room summons up the ghostly crowd waiting for Dr Popper to begin his paper and picks out our nine , now returned to youth , from among them .
Inevitably the eye goes first to the crowning intellects of the evening .
In front of the fireplace , placidly smoking his pipe , is the silver - haired Bertrand Russell .
To Russell 's left , facing the audience , is an apparently quiet and insignificant figure , Karl Popper .
One or two of the undergraduates are noting his prominent ears - altogether out of proportion to his small stature - to joke about over a pint after the meeting .
Popper is taking the measure of his adversary , whom he has thought about so much but until now never actually seen : Wittgenstein , the club 's chairman , sitting to Russell 's right .
He too is small , but filled with nervous energy , passing his hand over his forehead as he waits to open the meeting and looking at Popper with those penetrating blue eyes and their ' intensely white and large surrounds that make you feel uncomfortable ' .
Wittgenstein and Popper are our reason for being here .
But now the eye moves on to the young Palestinian graduate , Wasfi Hijab , He is clutching the Moral Science Club minute book , in which he will later pen the understatement describing the confrontation of the evening : ' The meeting was unusually charged . '
It was Hijab who had sent the neatly hand written invitation to Popper and negotiated a change of date , from the club 's habitual Thursday to Friday , to suit the guest .
Like all such secretaries , he feels responsible for the guest 's showing up and frets about his arrival until he actually sees him in the flesh .
Popper 's firm handshake is an early sign that his slight frame conceals an assertive personality .
Sitting nearby is one of Popper 's closest friends in Cambridge , Peter Munz , researching for a postgraduate degree in history .
Munz is one of only two to have studied under both Wittgenstein and Popper : he was taught by Popper in New Zealand during the war and , as a transparently earnest , bright student just a few weeks earlier had been welcomed by Wittgenstein into his Whewell 's Court seminars .
Munz recalls Popper pacing slowly across the room , throwing and catching a piece of chalk , never once breaking stride , and speaking in long and perfectly constructed sentences .
Now he has encountered Wittgenstein , who wrestles visibly with his ideas , holding his head in his hands , occasionally throwing out staccato remarks , as though each word were as painful as plucking thorns , and muttering , ' God I am stupid today ' or shouting , ' Damn my bloody soul !...
Help me someone !'
Then , there is John Vinelott , at twenty - three his features still showing the strain of his recent naval service in the Far East .
A chance happening during the war brought him to this spot .
Before joining the Navy , he was a student of languages at London University .
Then , browsing in a bookshop in Colombo , the capital of what he knew as Ceylon , now Sri Lanka , he picked up a copy of Wittgenstein 's Tractatus Logico - Philosophicus and was immediately riveted .
At the war 's end he switched to Cambridge ' to sit at Wittgenstein 's feet ' .
The sceptical eyes that will later disconcert so many litigants and barristers are now weighing up the guest speaker , Popper .
That afternoon 's session in Whewell 's Court had been an even more vigorous intellectual workout than usual .
Besides the puzzle of speaking to oneself , they had discussed the flexibility of the rules of mathematics .
' Suppose you had all done arithmetic within this room only , ' Wittgenstein had hypothesized .
' And suppose you go into the next room .
Might n't this make 2+2- - 5 legitimate ? '
He had pushed this apparent absurdity further .
' If you came back from the next room with 20X20=600 , and I said that was wrong , could n't you say , " But it was n't wrong in the other room . " '
Vinelott is still preoccupied with this .
He has never before met a man of such intensity : ' incandescent with intellectual passion ' will be his memory .
Near the front sits a Wittgenstein ultra : Peter Geach , a postgraduate , though currently without any official Cambridge raison d'etre .
However , his wife , Elizabeth Anscombe , is a graduate student at the women 's college , Newnham , and , like her husband , a member of the MSC .
Tonight she is at home in Fitzwilliam Street , just beyond King 's Parade , looking after their two young children .
Both husband and wife are very close to Wittgenstein : she will become one of his heirs , translators and literary executors , and a leading philosopher in her own right .
Wittgenstein refers to her fondly as ' old man ' .
A near - contemporary description of her is ' stocky ... wearing slacks and a man 's jacket ' .
Together Elizabeth and Peter make a formidable academic couple , both with first - class degrees in what is said to be Oxford 's toughest intellectual challenge , Literae Humaniores , the study of ancient Greek and Latin literature , Greek and Roman history , and ancient and modern philosophy .
Their philosophy is informed by an unwavering commitment to Roman Catholicism .
In Peter 's case this may in part be a reaction to the fickleness of his father , who was in the habit of switching between religions every few months without apparent agonies of conscience ; in Elizabeth 's case to her being a convert .
Searching among the expectant crowd we can also locate Stephen Toulmin , Peter Gray - Lucas , Stephen Plaister and Georg Kreisel .
All four have come to Cambridge after contributing to the war effort .
Originally a student of mathematics and physics , Toulmin had been based in a radar research station .
Now , at twenty - four , having given up science , he is a graduate student in philosophy : his doctoral thesis is considered of such a high standard that it will be taken for publication by Cambridge University Press even before being accepted by the examiners .
He has rushed here from the cottage which he rents from G. E. Moore , the former Professor of Philosophy , and which is at the end of Moore 's garden .
Peter Gray - Lucas , a talented linguist , fluent in German , played his part in the war at the top - secret decoding centre at Bletchley Park , where so much of the Nazis ' fighting strategy was undone .
Georg Kreisel , Jewish and Austrian - born , was in the Admiralty ; he is one of the few people not to be intimidated or overawed by Wittgenstein .
Kreisel delights in the cruder of Wittgenstein 's ceaseless stream of aphorisms , such as ' Do n't try and shit higher than your arse ' , which Wittgenstein applied to philosophers like Popper who thought they could change the world .
Stephen Plaister is less engaged with philosophy and has little contact with Wittgenstein .
He will , however , always treasure one memory .
After bumping into Wittgenstein and Kreisel in the street , Plaister was later told by Kreisel that Wittgenstein had liked his face .
And there , standing out among the ex-servicemen for his youthful demeanour , is the fresh - faced Michael Wolff , straight from school at nineteen , and feeling a bit out of his depth .
They and the rest of our spectral phalanx are for the most part dressed in heavy sports jackets , grey flannels , regimental or school ties , perhaps a waistcoat or Fair Isle pullover .
Remnants of service uniform can still be seen on those short of clothing coupons .
One or two might have ' I was there ' suede desert boots and cavalry - twill trousers .
Wittgenstein 's disciples stand out instantly for their aping of the master : casual , even sloppy , in open - neck shirts .
It is only to be expected that each of those present in that crowded room has a slightly different recollection of the night 's events .
Some had a restricted view .
One thing happened on top of another , making the precise sequence uncertain .
The flow of debate was so fast that it was difficult to follow .
But most share one memory : the poker itself .
' Consider this poker , ' Peter Geach hears Wittgenstein demand of Popper , picking up the poker and using it in a philosophical example .
But as the discussion rages on between them , Wittgenstein is not reducing the guest to silence ( the impact he is accustomed to ) , nor the guest silencing him ( ditto ) .
Finally , and only after having challenged assertion after assertion made by Popper , Wittgenstein gives up .
At some stage he must have risen to his feet because Geach sees him walk back to his chair and sit down .
He is still holding the poker in his hand .
With a look of great exhaustion on his face , he leans back in his chair and stretches out his arm towards the fireplace .
The poker drops on to the tiles of the hearth with a little rattle .
At this point Geach 's attention is caught by the host , Richard Braithwaite .
Alarmed by Wittgenstein 's gesticulating with the poker , he is making his way in a crouching position through the audience .
He picks up the poker and somehow makes away with it .
Shortly afterwards Wittgenstein rises to his feet and , in a huff , quietly leaves the meeting , shutting the door behind him .
Michael Wolff sees that Wittgenstein has the poker idly in his hand and , as he stares at the fire , is fidgeting with it .
Someone says something that visibly annoys Wittgenstein .
By this time Russell has become involved .
Wittgenstein and Russell are both standing .
Wittgenstein says , ' You misunderstand me , Russell .
You always misunderstand me . '
He emphasizes ' mis ' , and ' Russell ' comes out as ' Hrussell ' .
Russell says , ' You 're mixing things up , Wittgenstein .
You always mix things up . '
Russell 's voice sounds a bit shrill , quite unlike when lecturing .
Peter Munz watches Wittgenstein suddenly take the poker - red hot - out of the fire and gesticulate with it angrily in front of Popper 's face .
Then Russell - who so far has not spoken a word - takes the pipe out of his mouth and says firmly , ' Wittgenstein , put down that poker at once ! '
His voice is high - pitched and somewhat scratchy .
Wittgenstein complies , then , after a short wait , gets up and walks out , slamming the door .
From where Peter Gray - Lucas is sitting , Wittgenstein seems to be growing very excited about what he obviously believes is Popper 's improper behaviour and is waving the poker about .
Wittgenstein is acting in 'his usual grotesquely arrogant self - opinionated , rude and boorish manner .
It made a good story afterwards to say that he had " threatened " Popper with a poker . '
Stephen Plaister , too , sees the poker raised .
It really seems to him the only way to deal with Popper , and he has no feeling of surprise or shock .
To Stephen Toulmin , sitting only six feet away from Wittgenstein , nothing at all out of the ordinary is occurring ; nothing that in hindsight would merit the term ' incident .
He is focusing on Popper 's attack on the idea that philosophy is meaningless and his production of various examples .
A question about causality arises , and at that point Wittgenstein picks up the poker to use as a tool in order to make a point about causation .
Later in the meeting - but only after Wittgenstein has left - he hears Popper state his poker principle : that one should not threaten visiting lecturers with pokers .
There is also written testimony from Hiram McLendon , an American from Harvard , who spent the academic year 19467 in Cambridge studying under Russell and was there in H3 .
Such an impact did the evening have on him that many years later he wrote up his memories , checking his narrative with Russell , who approved it .
The florid description casts his former tutor in the role of hero - ' a towering giant , a roaring lion , a rod of reproof .
Popper , he wrote , had delivered his paper almost with ' apology for its boldness ' .
It got a stormy reception , with those in the audience becoming increasingly agitated .
Wittgenstein turned active , grabbed the iron poker , and waved it in a hostile manner , his voice rising in pitch , as he berated the visitor .
Whereupon Russell , so far silent , suddenly sprang to Popper 's defence , his ' bushy white hair crowning his stance ' as he ' roared forth like a Sinaitic god ' .
In most of these accounts the poker is imprinted on the witness 's mind .
But only John Vinelott sees the crucial point whether Popper makes what was probably an attempt at a joke to Wittgenstein 's face - in Popper 's way .
Vinelott hears Popper utter his poker principle and observes that Wittgenstein is clearly annoyed at what he thinks is an unduly frivolous remark .
Wittgenstein leaves the room abruptly , but there is no question of the door being slammed .
Up against these versions stands Karl Popper 's testimony , a detailed narrative in which he sees how Wittgenstein uses the poker for emphasis , how he demands a statement of a moral principle , and how he , Popper , responds , ' Not to threaten visiting lecturers with pokers . '
He sees Wittgenstein throw down the poker and storm out , slamming the door .
How does Professor Geach deal with these divergent accounts ?
Manifesting the depth of passion that the incident still incites , he declares simply that Popper lied .
For Geach , the crucial issue is straightforward : whether Wittgenstein left the meeting after Popper cited the poker - threat principle , as Popper claimed .
Geach is certain that he saw Wittgenstein leave before that .
For his part , Professor Watkins displayed some uncertainty about his version after being challenged in the Times Literary Supplement .
Following further research , he wrote to say that he was prepared to reserve judgement on exactly when Wittgenstein left the meeting - ' as a matter of detail ' .
It was a risky concession .
After all , in Popper 's autobiographical account Wittgenstein 's rage had probably been caused by Popper 's joking - logically impossible if Wittgenstein left before the joke .
In the event as in cross-examination , to concede served only to move the advocate to still higher levels of scorn and further criticism of the witness .
Disdainfully Geach rejoined , ' If somebody falsely says " John and Mary had a baby and then got married " , he would not be very well defended by a friend who said his memory might have slipped as to whether the birth or the marriage came first . '
On crucial elements of the story - the sequence of events , the atmosphere , how the antagonists behaved - there are clear memories equally clearly in conflict .
The poker is red - hot or it is cool .
Wittgenstein gesticulates with it angrily or uses it as a baton , as an example , as a tool .
He raises it , uses it for emphasis , shakes it or fidgets with it .
He leaves after words with Russell or he leaves after Popper has uttered the poker principle .
He leaves quietly or abruptly , slamming the door .
Russell speaks in a high - pitched voice or he roars .
What really happened , and why ?

Alex Pagulayan Amazing 9 Ball Break Shot
This is just insane .
Alex Pagulayan , the number one ranked snooker player by AZB , sinks 6 of 9 balls on a Nine Ball break shot .
Unreal .
I guess this is what you do when you are n't suing the Philippines billiard and snooker congress .
This guy is just such a character .
He'd be a trip to play a game of eight ball with at a bar or something .
It 's really guys like Alex who make the sport more popular and enjoyable to watch , IMHO .

That is unbelievable .
Imagine if he missed the 9 ball on the final shot .
He 'd probably sue the felt maker .
billiardsforum on 8/15/2008 7:25:57 AM
Haha we 'll he did make a mistake on the 2nd to last ball , giving his opponent the ability to come in and finish the rack .
They did say the table had brand new felt , which apparently makes the balls roll much easier and farther .
Justanotherevolutionary on 2/4/2009 7:13:49 PM
Holy hell ... I finally watched this .
Very nice indeed .
Notice how he even left the cue ball about 18 " from center center and an easy shot on the 6 . wow .
You can't ask for much more than that , except maybe that the 9 ball go too ... why not !
I imagine he was so amped up he just did n't respect his leave enough .
Too bad to lose the rack after that kind of break .
Impressive none the less .
I made a 5 ball break and almost had 5 heart attacks , unfortunately , I too lost that rack hehe .
But hey it just would n't be pool if that kind of stuff did n't happen from time to time .
I also saw a 5 ball break which included the 9 ... and it scratched .
( 6 ball break actually I guess )
That one had to hurt .
Three Brothers Billiards on 4/2/2009 8:52:15 AM
Alex Pagulayan is my favorite pro .
The guy is so much fun to watch .
He is just a funny guy with a good sense of humor .
Watch this video and you 'll see what I mean .
Justanotherevolutionary on 4/2/2009 2:39:45 PM
Yea , I finally saw him in a tournament against Bustamante .
He had a 9 ball to win the match and $ 50,000 and he turned his head as he shot , missed it , but got back to the table and won .
Frickin hilarious , what a player and sportsman , nobody I would rather play .
He also screams like a little girl , this guy is just great , so fun to watch .
jerandichat on 6/27/2009 1:36:38 AM
Wow man , you have to be kidding me ?
This guy is better than Bustamante !

The country ’s biggest banks have made moves to bolster their balance sheets by about $ 56 billion since the government disclosed the results of its financial “ stress tests ” two weeks ago , Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said Wednesday .
Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee , Mr. Geithner said that the financial system had begun to “ heal , ” and that the Treasury would soon be introducing the next phase of its financial rescue effort  the plan to team up with private investors to buy billions of dollars in toxic assets from banks .
“ There are important indications that our financial system is starting to heal , ” Mr. Geithner told lawmakers , though he cautioned that it was still too early to talk about an “ exit strategy ” for the government .
4 . Do n’t wait for him to make the first move .
Chances are , no matter how much initiative Mr. Right may take in his everyday life ( or in the sack * grin * ) he ’s usually too distracted , busy , or , heaven forbid , shy to make the first move .
There are a lot of people out there , good and bad , who have been put through the ringer in terms of relationships , and a Mr. Right who has run into a whole string of crazy women or is afraid of rejection will rarely , rarely make the first move .
Does this make him less of a man ?
Heck no .
it just means you have to have the ovaries to suck in all your fears and baggage and let him know that you ’re interested in him .
In all honesty , some of the best men I ’ve ever had in the sack were also some of the shyest .
5 . Do n’t be afraid to let your sexy show .
You do n’t have to be a supermodel to be sexy , and you do n’t need to dress like the high - class woman of the night who hangs out on street corners either to catch Mr. Right ’s eyes , but what you do need is just a little style .
I hate high heel shoes , but I have lots of guy friends who go nuts for them .
Short skirts ( but not belt - length short ) and shirts that show off what you ’ve got upstairs help , but the main thing is to find clothing that is clean , that fits nice , and that matches .
I dated a guy once that thought the sexiest look in the world was jeans and a tanktop , and he was something else , let me tell you ( in a fantastic way . )
If you can , find out what kind of look does it for him , ( You might even try a couple looks and ask him what he thinks ) and wear that whenever you ’re around him .
6 . Be optimistic .
Not just about your chances of finding Mr. Right , but about everything around you .
It ’s a mindset .
Watch yourself – if you ’re out during the course of the day and all you can think about is what ’s wrong in the world , you ’re going to attract guys that see nothing but what ’s wrong in the world too .
Mr. Right is optimistic , and if you want to catch his eye , focus on all the things in life that are frikkin’ awesome , like the color of the sky , the one dandelion that happens to pop up in some suburbanite ’s lawn , or the fact that you are alive .
Spend some time thinking about all the things you ’re grateful for , and focus on those .
Only you can brighten your day– no one else can do it for you , no matter how long you wait .

Joining forces with Chrysler was apparently just the start for Italian automaker Fiat .
The company is now reportedly in negotiations to buy most of General Motors ' European operations , in a bid to become the world 's second - largest automaker .
Reuters reports , " A radical overhaul of the car industry moved a step closer on Monday as Fiat 's CEO prepared to pitch a bid for Opel to Germany 's leaders as part of a planned takeover of General Motors ' European assets . "
The deal might see Fiat acquire all GM's European operations , according to Autoblog , " including Opel , Vauxhall and even Saab . "
The Opel brand accounts for 80 percent of GM's European sales .
The New York Times adds , " A combined Fiat , Opel and Chrysler would have annual sales of about 5.5 million units and revenue of about 80 billion euros , or $ 106 billion . "
That would make the combined company the world 's second largest automaker , behind Toyota .
The deal is far from certain .
Reuters notes , " The biggest opposition to a deal is likely to come from German and Italian unions , fearing synergies to be extracted from a merger would lead to job cuts and plant closures . "

The NYTimes has a piece analyzing the policy discussions in the US around the question of what should be the proper stance towards offensive cyberwarfare .
This is a question that the Bush administration wrestled with , before deciding that the outgoing president did n't have the political capital left to grapple with it .
The article notes two instances in which President Bush approved the use of offensive cyberattacks ; but these were exceptions , and the formation of a general policy was left to the Obama administration .
WASHINGTON  Doctors , hospitals , drug makers and insurance companies will join President Obama on Monday in announcing their commitment to a sharp reduction in the growth of national health spending , White House officials said Sunday .
The officials said the plan could save $ 2,500 a year for a family of four in the fifth year and a total of $ 2 trillion for the nation over 10 years .
That could make it less expensive for Congress to enact comprehensive health insurance coverage , a daunting challenge facing the Obama administration .
At this point , administration officials said , they do not have a way to enforce the commitment , other than by publicizing the performance of health care providers to hold them accountable .
By offering to hold down costs voluntarily , providers said , they hope to stave off new government price constraints that might be imposed by Congress or a National Health Board of the kind favored by many Democrats .
Gingrich calls it quits Speaker 's surprise decision follows challenge from Livingston ; post- election recriminations continue WASHINGTON ( AllPolitics , November 6 ) --
In the face of a brewing rebellion within the Republican Party over the disappointing midterm election , House Speaker Newt Gingrich made the stunning decision Friday to step down not just from the speakership , but also leave Congress .
House Speaker Newt Gingrich " Today I have reached a difficult personal decision .
I will not be a candidate for Speaker of the 106th Congress , " Gingrich said in a written statement released Friday evening .
Gingrich told friends it is unlikely that he will return at all when Congress reconvenes in January , but is not ruling out that possibility altogether .
Gingrich did say during a series of phone calls informing members of the Republican caucus of his decision that he will not serve out his full two - year term in the 106th Congress .
Gingrich 's move came as a shock , as the speaker had been fighting to keep his top job up until Friday afternoon .

Armey also faces challenge
Livingston praises but challenges Gingrich
Dump the leadership ' bandwagon grew quickly Sources say Gingrich made the choice when he was told as many as 30 Republicans would refuse to vote for him on the floor of the House .
Another close associate of Gingrich said the speaker did not want to be the center of attention and distract his party for the next two years .
" The Republican conference needs to be unified and it is time for me to move forward , " Gingrich 's statement said .
Rumors of a leadership shakeup surfaced quickly after Tuesday 's election when the GOP suffered a surprising loss of five seats in the party 's slim House majority .
Just weeks before , Republicans had been confident they could add to their majorities in the House and Senate .
Earlier Friday , Gingrich 's longtime friend and ally , Rep. Bob Livingston , announced he would challenge Gingrich for the speakership .
With his party in turmoil , Gingrich has been closeted at his Georgia home , calling dozens of colleagues to assess whether he could survive the latest leadership challenge .
Rep. Bill Archer
Though he received support from members of the caucus he spoke with by phone , Gingrich only reached 40 to 50 people , indicating that many were not returning his calls .
Gingrich , the chief architect of GOP " Contract With America , " has been a lightning rod for controversy ever since he steered his party to the majority in 1994 and took control of the speaker 's gavel .
Over the past year , though , Gingrich had started to reverse his extremely low favorability ratings , which climbed from a low point of 24 percent to the 30 percentage point range .
A recent CNN poll gave him a favorability rating of 42 percent .
The speaker has also served as a political foil to President Bill Clinton , who praised Gingrich 's service to the country in a statement Friday , calling him a " worthy adversary , leading the Republican party to a majority in the House . "
" Despite our profound differences , I appreciate those times we were able to work together in the national interest , especially Speaker Gingrich 's strong support for America 's continuing leadership for freedom , peace and prosperity in the world , " Clinton said .
Who will replace Gingrich ?
The next task for the Republican party is to find a replacement who can speak for the disparate elements of the party .
With a caucus ranging from the extremely conservative to the moderate , the GOP could have a hard time deciding on a consensus candidate .
Gingrich alluded to that challenge , saying , " I urge my colleagues to pick leaders who can both reconcile and discipline , who can work together and communicate effectively . "
Livingston is not the only person who is likely to compete for Gingrich 's soon - to - be vacant post .
Rep. James Talent of Missouri is reported to be considering a run , and five or six other contenders could easily make a run , too .
Other possibilities include Rep. Bill Archer , the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee who authored the proposed Republican tax cut , and moderate Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington .
All players have until November 18 to line up support within the caucus , when the Republican conference will meet to select its leaders for the 106th Congress .
But it could take longer than that to pick a successor .
Armey also faces challenge Earlier Friday , Oklahoma Rep .
Steve Largent announced he is seeking to replace House Majority Leader Dick Armey in the No. 2 House leadership post .
" On November 3rd the Republican party hit an iceberg .
And I think the question that is before our conference today is whether we retain the crew of the Titanic , " said Largent , an ex-pro football player and member of the Hall of Fame .
Rep. Steve Largent Delivering a scathing criticism of the current GOP leadership , Largent said , " Clearly the last two years are nothing to be proud of . "
" We've had a leadership vacuum for four years in Washington , D.C. , that has basically been blown about by the winds of public opinion polls and focus groups as opposed to relying upon a standard and principle ... that define the Republican party .
That has been the reason we 've had conflict within our own conference . "
Armey , meanwhile , has sent a damage control letter to Republican members outlining the issues in his campaign to retain his seat .
" We need to rekindle the spirit of the Contract with America , " he wrote , " We must craft a clear , powerful Agenda 2000 . "
Gingrich and Armey were not the only GOP leaders in the cross hairs as Rep. George Radanovich of California informed Ohio's Rep. John Boehner that he planned to run for chairman of the House Republican Conference , the No. 4 post Boehner now holds .
Livingston praises but challenges Gingrich Livingston , a high ranking and well respected member of the Republican Party , could have posed the most serious challenge yet to Gingrich .
He said for his party to succeed in the 106th Congress the GOP will be " stick to our principles and set reasonable goals for ourselves . "
Rep. Bob Livingston Livingston lavished praise on his " dear friend " Gingrich , crediting him with giving Republicans in 1994 their first majority in 40 years .
But the Louisiana Republican said he has the talent to both energize the party 's base and run the day - to - day affairs of the GOP conference .
" Revolutionizing takes some talents , many talents , " said Livingston .
" My friend Newt Gingrich brought those talents to bear and put the Republicans in the majority .
Day - to - day governing takes others .
I believe I have those talents . "
As speaker , Livingston said he can do a better job than Gingrich at " making sure that the trains run on time " and " assessing , setting , and articulating a practical agenda . "
Gingrich 's resignation does not necessarily leave Livingston as the front - runner , though .
At six foot , five inches , the chairman is an imposing figure , respected for his steadfast fiscal conservatism but also known for his hot temper .
Livingston 's willingness to deal with Democrats could be considered to be a liability by some hard - nose Republicans .
' Dump the leadership ' bandwagon grew quickly Since election day Republicans have been playing the blame game , with more and more Republicans piling on to the " dump the leadership " bandwagon .
Rep. Matt Salmon of Arizona predicted Friday that there was enough Republican opposition to Gingrich 's leadership to deny him a new term .
Salmon , an Arizona Republican elected Tuesday to a third term , said at least seven Republican members of the House will not vote to re-elect Gingrich as speaker .
" There may be as many as 30 or 40 , " he said on NBC's " Today " show .
" I know there are at least seven . "
" Four years ago we won the Super Bowl ( the 1994 Republican wins ) , " Salmon said .
" We have n't had a winning season since .
We 've got to change coaches or we 'll lose our franchise . "
Rep. Bob Barr , one of President Bill Clinton 's harshest critics , said Friday the national leadership of the Republican Party is having " some serious problems in terms of defining and delivering a consistent message " and there need to be changes in personnel .
Barr , whose Georgia district is next to Gingrich's , said , " the current team , I do n't think , will remain nor should it . "
CNN's Ann Curley , David Ensor , Bob Franken and John King contributed to this report .
White blood cells , the immune system 's " soldiers " for your body , actually crawl along your blood vessels to find their way to infection and injury sites , new research shows .
The cells move like millipedes , creating many minute legs that adhere to the endothelial cells lining blood vessel walls , said researcher Ronen Alon of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel .
Scientists had previously thought that these cells moved like inchworms , forming attachments at their front and back , then folding in the middle and pushing forward .
Instead , the cells ' tiny legs rapidly attach and detach themselves , allowing the cells to quickly migrate to their destination .
When the scientists looked closely at these limb - like protrusions , using an electron microscope , they saw that the legs actually " dig " into the endothelium .
The white blood cells may use the protrusions for more than just gripping and moving .
The legs might also sense signals that let the cells know when to exit from the blood vessel and migrate to damaged tissue , Alon said .
Before this study , scientists thought the legs only appeared after the cells left blood vessels .
But since the protrusions are also used for crawling , they might help the cells probe for cues that indicate to move across the endothelial barrier and leave the blood vessels , Alon said .
This work , funded by the De Benedetti Foundation , was published in the March 20 issue of the journal Immunity .
We were told emphatically that wives and partners were not allowed to join the touring party until the last two weeks of the four - month tour .
We needed to prepare properly for this important tour and boy , did we .
Boonie started the tour off beautifully by breaking Doug Walters ' and Rod Marsh 's record by downing 52 cans from Sydney to London .
Perfect start !
We had a long tour scheduled .
We had to play six Tests and 14 first - class matches and a host of one - day matches along the way .
The problem for us was after we played a Test Match we had to travel that night to our next destination and play a first - class match the next day .
This strategy worked well until we won the fourth Test and the Ashes at Old Trafford .
Yes , the " keg on legs " David Boon hit the winning runs and what a party we had that night .
First , I must say thanks to the touring management for not sending Boonie home in disgrace after his " Big Drink " .
The best memory for the tour was when Boonie stood on top of the table in the rooms and belted out the chant , Underneath the Southern Cross .
We sang songs like I Still Call Australia Home and Khe Sanh for an hour in the showers .
The 17 players and management , all naked with a beverage in hand , just rejoicing on a wonderful achievement .
It 's a boy thing .
I wished my dad was with me to celebrate with us .
So I rang him from the balcony at Old Trafford to say thanks for helping me convert my dream into reality .
My mum hated watching me play .
So she went outside to garden to take her mind off me playing .
Even if it was 4 am .
So I told Dad it was time for Mum to come inside .
It was 8 pm on the last day of the fourth Test when we realised that we had to travel to Nottingham to play in a first - class match the next day .
Allan Border and Terry Alderman said that they had injuries and we did n't believe them .
There was a three - hour bus trip and some partying to be had before the game started the next day .
When we arrived that night in Trent Bridge we had to find a night club .
We saw one across the road and hurdled a fence that left us with paint on our hands that could n't be removed for seven days .
Geoff Marsh woke me and four others at 10 am and we headed off to our game against Nottingham .
We thought five players was enough for a team .
Nottingham captain Derek Randall picked up Marsh and went out for the toss .
Marsh pleaded to Randall that it was too far to walk to the middle , so could they do the toss from the boundary .
Marsh could n't be bothered looking at the pitch .
When Marsh won the toss and elected to bat , Randall could n't believe his luck .
Nottingham had produced a pitch that was as green as the outfield .
Marsh told Randall to follow him to the dressing rooms to see why he chose to bat .
When Marsh opened our dressing room door , all Randall could see was four Australian batsmen padded up and lying asleep on the dressing room floor .
" These are the only ' fit ' players we have , " Marsh told him .
For the record , we won in two days .
There were other records broken on this 1989 Ashes Tour .
The Australian team was asked to compete in the Highland Games .
The whole team turned up in kilts and sporrans and got into the swing of things .
Tom Moody had to stand on top of a keg and was asked to throw a haggis .
Moody was a " little under the weather " , and asked what the world record was ?
It is documented in the Guinness Book of Records that Moody threw a haggis 71 metres !
The haggis landed up on a car parked well outside the marked landing area !
Was there anything we could n't do ?
When I look at this 2009 Australian Ashes squad , I ask :
Who could beat Boonie 's 52 can record from Sydney to London ?
Who could throw a haggis more than 233 feet ?
And , last , will they win the series 4 - 0 ?
Times have changed indeed .
Their only chance is to win 4-0 .
BENTON HARBOR , Michigan ( CNN ) -- Former President George W. Bush on Thursday repeated Dick Cheney 's assertion that the administration 's enhanced interrogation program , which included controversial techniques such as waterboarding , was legal and garnered valuable information that prevented terrorist attacks .
Former President George W. Bush defended his administration in speech Thursday in Michigan .
Bush told a southwestern Michigan audience of nearly 2,500 -- the largest he has addressed in the United States since leaving the White House in January -- that , after the September 11 attacks , " I vowed to take whatever steps that were necessary to protect you . "
In his speech , Bush did not specifically refer to the high - profile debate over President Obama 's decision to halt the use of harsh interrogation techniques .
Bush also did n't mention Cheney , his former vice president , by name .
Instead , he described how he proceeded after the capture of terrorism suspect Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in March 2003 .
" The first thing you do is ask what 's legal ? "
Bush said .
" What do the lawyers say is possible ?
I made the decision , within the law , to get information so I can say to myself , ' I 've done what it takes to do my duty to protect the American people . '
I can tell you that the information we got saved lives . "
Bush avoided the sharp tone favored by Cheney in recent weeks and stressed he does not want to disparage Obama .
" Nothing I am saying is meant to criticize my successor , " Bush said .
" There are plenty of people who have weighed in .
Trust me , having seen it first - hand .
I did n't like it when a former president criticized me , so therefore I am not going to criticize my successor .
I wish him all the best . "
The former president was speaking to the Economic Club of Southwestern Michigan .
In a change in format , he agreed to answer questions directly from the audience instead of responding to pre-submitted questions provided to a moderator .
He repeated his disclaimer about not passing judgment on Obama later when asked about North Korea 's nuclear test .
Before answering , the 43rd president said he is " in no way trying to shape my successor 's decisions or criticize them . "
" I know there are news people here , and they love conflict , " he said .
Bush then went on to say that diplomacy is impossible without leverage .
" A lot of times people want to give out the carrots , " he said .
" My attitude is , you give out the carrots when the behavior changes . "
After his opening remarks , Bush engaged in a nearly hour - long back - and - forth with audience members that touched on nearly all aspects of his presidency , from the September 11 attacks to his ban on embryonic stem cell research , to his consultations with advisers as the economic crisis hit last year .
He strongly defended his Troubled Asset Relief Program in response to the economic crisis at the end of his presidency , calling it crucial to preventing capital markets from freezing up , which he said would have led to another Great Depression .
However , he said he remains " a free - market guy . "
Asked what he thinks about conservative pundits who say the Obama administration 's fiscal policies are opening the door to socialism , Bush said : " I think the verdict is out .
I think people are waiting to see what all this means . "
The former president received a noisy standing ovation when answering a question about what he wants his legacy to be .
" Well , I hope it is this :
The man showed up with a set of principles , and he was unwilling to compromise his soul for the sake of popularity , " he said .
He also revealed the topic of the first chapter in his forthcoming book , which he said will be about " the stories of my administration , as I saw them . "
That first chapter , he said , will answer the question : " Why did I run for president ? "

That said , some of the strategies listed below are things that could potentially turn into a full - time job , while others really might only provide a little extra spending money .

You wo n’t get rich taking surveys , but it may be one of the simplest money making websites out there .

5 Get paid to drive your own car So , by now you have probably ridden in an Lyft , but have you ever thought to drive for Lyft ?
Depending on your city you can make decent money all while having 100 % control of your schedule .
I ca n’t think of a more flexible job way to make some extra cash !
If you do n’t know what Lyft is , basically it is the 21st century version of the taxi .
You just use your own car and when someone near you wants a ride you get a notification on your phone ( assuming you selected that you were available in the app ) you go pick them up and drop them off where they want to go and then you automatically get paid .
6Use Bookscouter to sell books from Thrift stores
Ok here is a simple home - based business idea for you .
Start by downloading the BookScouter app on your phone or going to BookScouter.com .
Go visit garage sales or thrift shops and scan the used book sections to find books that you can sell for higher prices .
Many thrift stores sell all their books for 50 cents or less and some of those books are worth a whole lot more .
As you can see in the image to the right , you just scan the barcode with your phone ( or enter the ISBN # ) and then the app provides the prices that a bunch of book buyback sites are willing to pay for that particular book .
In this case , we can make $ 3.60 selling this Dave Ramsey book .
If I can buy it for 50 cents , then that sounds like a nice profit .
Most of the sites offer free shipping as well , so you do n’t even have to pay shipping .

The book covers the basics of getting started as well as how to get traffic and how to earn from it as well .

Agree to a thorough background check 9 Earn money from your credit cards
This only works if you do NOT carry a balance on your credit cards , but if you pay them off every month ( like you should ) you can be earning a good amount cash - back each month .
For example ..
If you got the Chase Freedom Unlimited card , it pays 1.5 % cashback on all purchases .
What that means is that most people using it as their primary card would earn $ 500 - $ 1,000 a year in cashback .
On top of that , they offer a $ 150 bonus , just for signing up .
( Compare this card with other cashback cards here )

I wrote extensively about the process that we use to travel for free in the U.S. here .
10 Get paid to declutter your house ?
I challenged myself to see how much money I could make in 30 days by decluttering my house and selling off the unwanted items .
When all was said and done , I made $ 2,184 by selling items that I did n’t even want anymore !
While it did take a good chunk of my freetime , after calculating how much I made per hour it was around $ 200 / hr !
Try to find a better paying job than that !
You can read all about exactly how I did it to maximize my earnings in the article below :
11 Get paid for testing websites
Many big companies are looking for feedback about the usability of their website .
This is where Usertesting .com comes in .
You sign up for free and then answer questions about a particular website , explaining what is good or bad , confusing or clear , etc. and then you get paid .
You have to be accepted into the program and must be 18 + , but the payouts are pretty good !
Their current payouts are $ 10 - $ 15 per test and the tests normally take about 20 minutes .
12 Buy and Sell cars for profit
If you love cars and are n’t afraid to haggle , you could start a car flipping biz .
We have a friend of the family who has done this for years .
He scours the classified listings for deals , lands a good deal and then drives the car while trying to sell it for a couple grand more .
Sometimes he sells them quickly , sometimes it takes a little longer , but he gets to drives lots of cars ( which he loves ) and makes a nice side income as well .
13 Sell your closet
If you are anything like my wife , you have a closet full of old clothes that you do n’t wear any more .
You can easily sell them on a site like ThredUp , which will pay anywhere from $ 2 - $ 25 for items from Gap , Banana Republic , J.Crew , etc .
What I love about them is that all you have to do is pack up your clothes in a box and then just ship it to them – you do n’t even have to pay for shipping !
This one would have come in really handy when I was 16 years old !
14 Invest in real estate Admittedly , this one requires some money in order to make money , but Fundrise has become my new favorite method of earning passive income so I figured it was worth the mention .
After running an experiment to see if Fundrise could earn more than my rental property , I discovered that it did indeed generate more income than my rental and so I quickly sold it !
15 Sell Plasma or do Medical studies
Not sure how old you have to be , nor how painful it is , but if you are into that sort of thing , it can be a way to make some quick money .
You can find plasma donation centers here or if you want to do medical studies , you can just google “ medical studies ” + your city to find some options .
I have a couple friends who have almost done this exclusively as a job .
They were basically human guinea pigs , but they made some decent cash at it .
Sometimes they would have to be at the medical facility for up to 48 hours , so your schedule may need to be flexible .
16 Work as a virtual call center agent
One of our writers worked as a virtual call center agent and this is what she had to say about LiveOps.com : “ Live Ops is a company that hires virtual call center agents .
You are responsible for paying for your own criminal background check prior to starting work ( this costs around $ 30 ) .
You also must have your own dedicated phone line and a quiet workspace .
Once you are all set up , Live Ops has an excellent online training program that teaches you how to handle calls from customers .
You will be taking calls for many different companies .
When you start working , your phone will ring and a script will pop up on your screen .
You simply read the script word for word and input customer information as you go along .
If customers have questions , there is a section on your screen with FAQ’s and you are also logged into a virtual chat room should you need to ask for support from a supervisor .
The pay is .25 per minute of talk time .
Agents typically make anywhere from $ 7 - $ 14 per hour .
As for the hours , they are totally flexible .
You can choose which shifts you want to work each week and the shifts are broken down into half hour increments giving you optimal flexibility .
You can even log in and work if you are not scheduled for some impromptu cash . ”

There is a cool app ( Android and iPhone ) called IBOTTA that pays you for your everyday shopping that you do .
It is completely free and pretty easy to use .
Just watch the quick video for more info : 18 Build Websites For Others
I ca n’t tell you how many people have asked me to build them a website since I started this one a couple years ago .
I am not seeking the work and people are requesting it , so if you do a little legwork and pursue small business owners , there is a lot of work available .
Teens might be great for this because they would be able to work for less than some higher end website developers , which would put them in the price range that it seems many small businesses are looking to spend .
19 Tutor or give lessons with Take Lessons
If you have a skill that you can teach other – guitar , singing , dancing – this is a great site for you to check out !
Take lessons gives you the opportunity to grow your business by reaching more students across the country with no risk – they do n’t get paid until you get a new student !

20 Create Facebook Graphics or Pages or Twitter backgrounds for that matter .
Lots of small business owners are needing help making their online presence not so lame .
If you have even the smallest amount of graphic design skill you can help some of them !
Just set up a simple site to sell your work , get a paypal “ buy it now link ” and you are off and running .
21 Rent out your car for $ 10 + an hour I just heard about Turo.com which allows you to either rent or lend your car to others – and get paid in the process .
It is basically like Airbnb , but for cars .
I have used it a ton to rent cars myself as it is a great way to save money , but have n’t actually rented my car out myself .
If you live in a big city , this could be pretty profitable !

If you are raising money for a community service project or missions , you might want to check out a site like GoFundMe.com .

People have used it to raise the money for everything from mission trips to medical bills , weddings and honeymoons , business ventures , and even college tuition .

A few years ago I experimented with starting an eBay business to see if there was money to be made .
Basically my experiment went like this : I found a wholesaler selling guitar necks I bought them at a discount from the wholesaler I then sold them at the retail prices on eBay I documented exactly how I did it in my guide : how to start an eBay business : step - by - step .

Could methanol be at the center of a cleaner , greener future infrastructure ?
( Image : Rex Features )
For years many companies , governments and researchers have predicted that our energy future must lie with the universe ’s simplest element .
The mooted hydrogen economy would use the gas to store and transport renewable or low - carbon energy , and power fuel cells in the transport sector or in portable electronics .
But creating the necessary society - wide infrastructure has proved difficult and expensive to get off the ground .
And now a rival idea , first suggested in 2006 by Nobel chemistry laureate George Olah at the University of Southern California , has received a boost .
The methanol economy , say its supporters , could be with us much sooner than the hydrogen one .

Hydrogen dangers
Olah ’s rationale is that modifying our existing oil and petrol - focused infrastructure to run on methanol will be much easier than refitting the world ’s liquid - fuel - based economy to deal with an explosive gas .
Methanol has already been used to power portable gadgets and could potentially power vehicles and other devices .
Now US chemists have worked out the conditions needed to make the feedstock for methanol production using renewable energy .
The research is significant because just as the lack of an efficient way to generate and store hydrogen is a major barrier to the idea of running civilisation on it , sourcing methanol on a vast scale is a similarly major hurdle .
Clean solution
The best way to make methanol is by steam reforming methane , produced when syngas – a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide – is turned into liquid hydrocarbons via reactions such as the Fischer - Tropsch process .
The process is used today to make diesel and other liquid fuels from coal , and kept South African cars going during the country ’s international isolation in the 1980s and 90s .
However , the whole point of the methanol economy would be to create a greener society , so any syngas must come from an environmentally friendly source , not fossil fuels .
Now chemist Scott Barnett at Northwestern University in Evanston , Illinois , and colleagues have shown that a solid oxide electrolysis cell , more normally used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen , could be that source .
Viable brew
Using a mix of one part CO 2 , one part hydrogen and two parts water in the device generates syngas at a rate which compares favourably with the processes used to make it from natural gas , says Barnett .
At peak conditions of 800 °C and 1.3 volts , the system can produce 7 standard cubic centimetres of syngas per minute for every square centimetre of the electrolysis cell ’s surface .
The next stage , turning the syngas into methanol , is a standard industrial reaction that is well understood .
Barnett ’s method requires a steady stream of water vapour and CO 2 , but both gases are released when the methanol is used in fuel cells , and could be captured and re-used , he says .
That would add to the costs involved , but a hydrogen economy would require similar gas - capture technology , says Barnett , because hydrogen production requires a plentiful source of fresh water , which is heavy to cart about .
Olah thinks Barnett ’s study is a useful one .
“ This [ methanol economy ] approach is now starting to be implemented around the world , ” he says .
“ New methanol plants are being built in China , South Korea , Japan and Iceland . ”
Limited scope
But others remain sceptical that methanol will ever occupy more than a small niche .
There are several well - known problems with the use of methanol .
Like hydrogen , and unlike petrol , methanol is not a source of energy , but simply an energy store , points out Ulf Bossel at the European Fuel Cell Forum in Oberrohrdorf , Switzerland .
“ The energy carried by methanol is less than was needed to make it , ” he adds .
Barnett agrees that methanol is a poor substitute for using the power from a renewable generator like a wind turbine directly .
But he says that in cases where direct use is not possible , liquid methanol beats the efficiency of hydrogen for storage and transportation .
Methanol could be used to store energy from renewable sources that often produce more electricity than is needed at a particular time , he says , and could also be useful at off - grid sites .
In these situations , Bossel agrees a modest methanol economy makes sense .
“ The hydrogen idea is gradually fading , ” he says .
“ Methanol could be a better solution because it is easier to handle . ”

Suburbs - our new slums ?
The burbs are in decline as more poor move out from the cities and more suburbanites struggle to stay in the middle class [ Pittsburgh Post - Gazette ] :
Mr. Nelson and others warn that suburbia 's least desirable neighborhoods --- aging , middle - class tract - home developments far from city centers and mass transit lines --- are America 's emerging slums , characterized by poverty , crime and other social ills .
Treating those ills is complicated by the same qualities that once defined suburbia 's appeal --- seclusion , homogeneity and low population density .
" We built too much of the suburban dream , and now it 's coming back to haunt us , " Mr. Nelson said .
Renewables Fever Sweeps State Legislatures
More states want solar power to be option on new homes
Should We Follow Germany 's Lead On Renewables ?
The basic idea is that utilities have to buy renewable power from anyone who produces it .
Period .
If I install a solar panel on my roof , I can sell that power into the grid , and the utility will offer me a 15 - to 20 - year contract at a fixed rate that will cover my costs and ensure a tidy profit .
( The rate is set by regulators , and the utility spreads the extra cost among all ratepayers ; in Germany , this has meant $ 4 more per household per month . )
The result ?
Private investors stampede in .
Germany , which gets less sun than Minnesota , now has half the world 's installed solar capacity .
Did the Oil Price Boom of 2008 Cause Crisis ?
[ T] here ’s the uncomfortable fact previous oil shocks , like the ones that came with the 1973 oil embargo , the 1979 Iranian revolution and the 1990 invasion of Kuwait , were also associated with recessions .
And the 2001 recession , too , came on the heels of a run- up in oil prices .
In a paper presented at the Brookings Panel on Economic Activity Thursday , University of Calif . - San Diego economist James Hamilton crunched some numbers on how consumer spending responds to rising energy prices and came to a surprising result :
Nearly all of last year ’s economic downturn could be attributed to the oil price shock .

Have we seen the Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœbearÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ market high in equities this week ?
The world feels an unsafe place .
After last weeks plethora of data and results , utopia was apparently around the corner as Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœgreen shootsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ were witnessed everywhere .
The first sign of frost has killed growth !
Forget the UFC , the new reality show du jour , Cat - fighting amongst ECB policy members !
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s giving the big dollar some breathing room for now , but , do not expect it to last .
The US $ is mixed in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is lower against 9 of the 16 most actively traded currencies in a Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœsubduedÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
US unemployment is starting to take effect as consumer spending is losing momentum .
This was witnessed in yesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s US retail sales data ( - 0.4 % vs. 0.0 % ) .
Analysts note that with the past 2 - months worth of declines , the US consumer has given back all of the gains in retail sales that capital markets witnessed in the beginning of the year .
The report is in total contrast to other indicators that were reported last month ( i.e. rising chain store sales ) .
Retail sales have now fallen 8 out the past 10 - months .
Its worth noting that the positive prints for both Jan. and Feb . were probable due to deferred spending on deep discounting , coupled with Fed transfers to households .
Cash hoarding cannot support Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœgreen shoot economicsÃ¢â‚¬â „¢.
Digging deeper , weakness appeared in most sub- categories like furniture ( - 0.5 % m / m ) , electronics ( - 2.8 % ) , food ( - 1.0 % ) and so on .
More of an eye opener was to see that gas station sales fell - 2.3 % despite a rise in prices .
Are North Americans driving less ?
The market will have to wait for other reports to conclude if its price or volume that has had the biggest impact on yesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s data .
The BOE Quarterly Inflation Report was Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœdovishÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ and certainly put pressure on GBP yesterday ( Gordon Brown and MPÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s expense fiasco does not help ) .
Governor King ’s sees inflation below its 2 % target at current market rates , this also included the sum of GBP125 b they have earmarked for quantitative easing .
Policy makers foresee CPI at + 1.2 % in 2 - years and +1.5 % in 3 - years .
Not at all the optimist , King said he sees Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœspare capacity building and unemployment rising and that the timing and pace of recovery were very hard to judgeÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ , but the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœpace of decline was moderatingÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢!
The USD $ currently is lower against the EUR +0.09 % , GBP +0.10 % and higher against CHF - 0.09 % and JPY - 0.27 % .
The commodity currencies are higher this morning , CAD +0.33 % and AUD +0.05 % .
Finally , as anticipated the loonie took it on the chin yesterday .
Last weeks bullish move certainly was over extended and the market seems to have got back to basics .
US retail sales data has pressurized both commodities and the equity market , by default this highly correlated high risk currency was expected to be affected .
It has rallied for the past 6 - weeks vs. its largest trading partner .
With recent global euphoria dampening , investors can expect to see better levels to own this commodity currency .
After last weeks violent move on the back of Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœeye - popping and questionableÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ employment numbers , it comes as no surprise that there remains a bias towards more advantageous levels to own the currency .
The countryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s fundamentals are strong when compared to other G7 partners , but it exports 70 % + of its goods and services south and 50 % of that revenue is commodity based .
The AUD in the O/N sessions is trading close to the weeks lows as Asian equities fell on the back of US retail sales unexpectedly dropping last month , thus reducing investorsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ appetite for the higher - yielding assets ( AUD , NZD and CAD ) .
Despite looking attractive , all high yielderÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s moves are aggressively overdone and itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s only natural that the market will want to consolidate even further ( 0.7530 ) .
Crude is lower in the O/N session ( $ 56.72 down - 130 c ) .
Oil prices gyrated in a tight range despite the weekly EIA report revealing an unexpected decline in inventories as imports plunged to the lowest level in 8 - months .
Crude supplies fell - 4.63 m barrels to +370.6 m vs. an expected increase of +1 m barrels ( imports fell - 12 % to +8.71 m ) .
Earlier this week the API reports showed that supplies dropped by - 3.13 m barrels , w/w .
Yes it was a bullish headline number , but , the market was given the heads up by the ADP results .
Year - to - date , crude prices have advanced +33 % this year , mostly on the back of a high percentage of OPEC members conforming to the last 9 - months of production cuts .
Surprisingly , OPEC yesterday stated that they boosted oil production last month for the 1st time since July .
( +967 k barrels a day over quota ) .
They are now adhering to 77 % of their self imposed cuts to production , the previous month it was 82 % .
Obviously these loft prices levels are to good to by - pass .
There remains a strong correlation between equities and oil , and at the moment equity prices seem to have got ahead of themselves .
This would imply that $ 60 a barrel remains a strong resistance point in the short term , one piece of data does not have much of an impact on a 19 - year record high of inventories .
The commodity market certainly has got ahead of its fundamentals and profit taking is probably warranted .
Gold rose as a weaker dollar has boosted the demand for the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ as a hedge against inflation ( $ 925 ) .
The Nikkei closed 9,093 down - 246 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 4,710 down - 17 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 4,340 up + 9 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is lower .
The 10 - year TreasuryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s eased 7 bp yesterday ( 3.11 % ) and are little changed in the O/N session .
Prices rallied after yesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s US retail sales data disappointed .
The poor headline suggests that the US economy is well entrenched in this recession .
With consumers paring spending , capital markets is now witnessing the delayed effect of the unemployed .
With stocks struggling and the government taking a 2 - week pause in its record sale of debt will also support the FI asset class .
Today we have the last of this weekÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s buy - backs .
Expect dealers once again to make the government pay up for product .

At long last , policy makers in Washington have begun to draw a line between illicit drug use and the legitimate use of drugs as medicine .
In March , Eric Holder , President Obama 's attorney general announced that the federal government will no longer prosecute medical marijuana clinics that operate in compliance with state laws .
This means lawmakers in Harrisburg are now free to decide -- without interference from Washington -- if marijuana will fill a medical niche in Pennsylvania .
Thirteen states have already removed criminal penalties for the use of medical marijuana and actively regulate how , with a medical doctor 's recommendation , marijuana is made available for patients with cancer , AIDS , multiple sclerosis , severe pain , glaucoma , epilepsy and other chronic conditions .
But until now , Washington has disregarded these state laws .
Since California legalized medical marijuana in 1996 , for example , federal agents have raided more than 100 marijuana distribution centers there .
The first step has been taken with Washington 's tacit acknowledgment that closing down state - regulated marijuana clinics is a misuse of taxpayers ' money and harmful to Americans coping with serious illnesses .
Many thousands of ill people attest that smoking , vaporizing or orally ingesting marijuana relieves pain , nausea and other symptoms far more effectively than Marinol , a pharmaceutically available synthetic version of marijuana .
While the federal government still officially maintains -- contrary to solid medical evidence -- that marijuana has no medicinal value , at least it has pledged not to raid medical marijuana facilities that are sanctioned by state law .
According to the Marijuana Policy Project , a Washington - based advocate for legalizing medical marijuana , only 14 states , including Pennsylvania , have never passed a law dealing with medical marijuana .
Pennsylvania need not reinvent the wheel and can easily avoid pitfalls along the way .
A 2006 poll asked registered voters in Pennsylvania if they favored " allowing adults to legally use marijuana for medical purposes if a doctor recommends it . "
Sixty - one percent said they did favor the measure .
Washington 's new medical marijuana policy gives Pennsylvania the freedom to exercise its historic role as the primary watchdog for the health and welfare of its citizens .
Whether Pennsylvania patients will be given greater access to medical marijuana is now up to the state Legislature .
Marijuana is not the only targeted medical drug .
In all 50 states , federal raids can still close down pain clinics and errant pain management physicians who prescribe large doses of opioids , highly effective , legal pain killers made from opium or synthetics with the properties of opiate narcotics .
Dr. Joel Hochman , director of the National Foundation for the Treatment of Pain in Houston , says the drug - war hysteria is making it too risky for many doctors to accept patients in chronic pain and that , with help from the media , federal raids on so called " pain mills " paint a false picture that the streets are awash in drugs carelessly handed out by unprincipled doctors .
Instead , he claims , these clinics provide last - resort care to largely uninsured or underinsured blue - collar and other limited - income workers , many with work - related injuries , who can only afford a five - minute visit at high volume , low - cost , low - profit clinics .
To stay in business these clinics must see 60 to 100 patients each day .
With this level of traffic , doctors can make errors and patients can lie about their aliments -- making the clinics easy targets for federal agents .
But since these clinics provide valuable medical services , Hochman says law enforcement policies are misdirected .
His bottom line is : " Wake up America .
The dope lords are making billions .
The little pain clinics in the strip shopping centers sure are n't . "
Here is a rare opportunity for elected officials in Pennsylvania and in Washington to take a long , hard look at how harsh drug laws are undermining medical care .
For millions of people desperately coping with chronic aliments , let 's not waste it .

Protests in Moldova .
Photo : Denis Graur
Riots broke out in Moldova — a former Soviet republic between Ukraine and Romania — as thousands protested the Communist party ’s victory in parliamentary elections , claiming the results were falsified .
One woman was killed and at least 100 were injured after the protests turned violent , with people surrounding the president ’s residence , burning furniture and throwing rocks .
The Communist party was voted into power in 2001 , a decade after Moldova declared independence .
Though Communist President Vladimir Voronin is due to step down in May , the Communist parliamentary majority means that the party will be able to choose a new leader .
Blogger Julien Frisch writes about the protests ’ motivations :
I see great disappointment among my Moldovan friends , disappointment over these election results that have confirmed an autocratic government that is massively favoured by the public newscaster , the only TV and Radio that can be received by all citizens in the Republic of Moldova . [ … ]
I just received a text message from Moldova telling me that a demonstration against Sunday ’s election results that started this morning at 10 am has turned violent .
Stones are flying towards the Parliament and the Presidential Palace .
Police reacts with water cannons .
Guest blogger “ Dorina ” at “ Kosmopolito ” writes from Moldova describing the protests , adding that news has spread quickly over the Internet ( a phenomenon which led one blogger at Foreign Policy to call the conflict a “ Twitter Revolution “ ) :
Most of the people found out about this initiative through different internet channels – blogs , forums and especially facebook .
People got surprised and enthusiastic to see that more than thousand of participants came at first and in the next hour there were already 10,000 of them .
After lighting candles at the monument of the national historic leader of all Moldovan people , young people went to the Parliament shouting “ Down with the communists ! ” , “ Better dead then communist ! ” , “ I refuse , I resist !
I am anti-communist ! ” , “ Freedom ! ” , “ Down with the censorship ! ” , “ We want repeated voting ! ” Later on , the leaders of the opposition parties adhered to the cause of the protesters .
From 6 pm till around 10 pm the long line of 10,000 people have stopped by all the important points : the Presidency , that faces the Parliament of the Republic , the Government and the Electoral Central Commission – all of this abide to the communist government and consider themselves democratic , open to the public institutions .
On Monday the protest went on really peacefully and people were only cheering and singing , protesting against the communists that are ruling .
Watch a video from YouTube user dorina20 md of protests :
The “ Scraps of Moscow ” blog summarizes what the Moldovan blogosphere is saying ( as many Moldovan bloggers write in Romanian ) and translates a post from Moldovan blogger Nicu Popescu suggesting a way forward :
My suggestion is that the EU should promote a “ new deal ” between the government and the opposition that could include some of the following elements .
– recount of the votes with strong international monitoring , and the recognition of the re-counted votes by the opposition .
– the dismissal of the the minister of interior who has been central to many pre-electoral abuses and harrassment of the opposition and the media .
the new minister of interior should be appointed by after consensus between the government and the opposition .
– initiating a process of police reform under the supervision of EU advisors , possibly extending the mandate of the EU Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine .
– Vladimir Voronin , the incumbent president ( at the end of his second term ) should respect the Moldovan constitution and retire from politics after his second term with guarantees for future immunity from prosecution .
The Communist party elects a new leader , who might enjoy a majority in the parliament .
There might be a Communist government ( if the recount confirms their victory ) , but without Voronin .
– The broadcasting licenses of existing independent media , particulaly PRO TV ( the only TV channel independent from the government ) should be extended .
A decision on that is pending .
Some of the protesters voiced their desire for reunification with Romania , shouting “ We are Romanians ! ” Commenter “ Mihai ” explains Moldova ’s political background and compares the current unrest to Ukraine ’s Orange Revolution :

Salon called it “ the weirdest Rachel Maddow interview ever , ” and while we at Mother Jones can neither confirm nor deny that statement , it ’s sure a hell of a lot weirder than our own Clara Jeffery ’s recent conversation with the breakout cable news star .
Plus , Clara actually talked less than the person she was interviewing , something Vanity Fair ‘s George Wayne could n’t manage in his bonkers Q&A .
The piece just made the rounds of the Mother Jones e-mail circle , and here ’s a sampling of comments :
Jen Phillips :
Our interview is so much better , even if it does n’t mention eproctophilia .
Mike Mechanic : Foul .
Me : Is this guy from 1923 ?
Dave Gilson :
Has anyone ever really uttered the phrase , “ listen to this saucy pedant ” ?
Nicole McClelland : I cannot believe VF printed two of this asinine interviewer ’s words to Maddow ’s every one .
How is it possible they let him go on about eating ass for not one , but two complete sentences ?
As you can see , this interview raises more questions than it answers .
Here ’s another one : Does saying “ darling ” a lot make up for using the term “ dyke - stache ” ?
Twice ?
If only there was an upcoming opportunity to ask Ms. Maddow how she felt about all this , at an event benefitting a non - profit magazine , for which there was an exclusive reception that still has some tickets available .
" They did n't announce it officially , but the rumour is that they were going to raise the excise tax on it 500 per cent .
It 's 11 ( per cent ) now and that puts it out in the market for $ 400 a box .
It would go up to $ 2000 if the excise goes up to 500 per cent , " he says .
Eric Payne , 22 , who is in the military , is buying up boxes of 45 mm and 9 mm ammunition for target practice .
" Everybody 's buying it right now , probably because of politics , because they think gun laws are going to change , " he says .
Some put the shortages down to America 's two wars , which are causing manufacturers to focus on military need , coupled with increased training exercises by other law enforcement officials .
But Mr Gilronan says there is also evidence of stockpiling by private gun owners , who fear the new political climate .
" Every time you tell people there 's a chance they can't have it , they are going to buy it as fast as they can get it , " he says .
Rick from Virginia , a tall , athletic - looking man in his mid-30s  he declines to give his last name  has loaded up a trolley with about a dozen boxes of ammunition of various calibres .
" The numbers I have seen suggest that 17 per cent of gun owners in America will defend their right to own guns with their lives , " he says .
" In order to able to do that , they have to be able to shoot them and so they are buying enough ammunition now so that should there be a shortage or legislation or anything else to restrict the supply of ammunition , they will have everything they need . "
Asked how many guns he owns , he laughs .
" There was a group at one stall back there wearing the same T - shirt .
It said : ' If you know how many guns you have you do not have enough ' .
Let 's put it this way : I would run out of fingers and toes . "
By now , I have attracted a small crowd and another , older man in a cap that identifies him as a Vietnam veteran , hearing that I am a reporter from Australia , looms into my personal space .
" Do you know anything about firearms ? " he asks .
" I have a lot of experience dealing with the press on this and I have yet to see the press do a decent job because I know what your agenda is .
" Will you give me your home address so that I can send my friends to get you and your editor if you do your usual 60 Minutes strangle - job ? " he says angrily .
I hazard another seemingly innocuous question : " I 've heard people are worried about President Obama tightening up on gun ownership , is that right ? "
" Oh yeah , we are paranoid ex-military , right - wing excrements , can't you tell ? " says the veteran , getting more worked up .
" Have you read President Obama 's lips ?
Are you familiar with his record as a senator from Illinois ? "
In the election campaign , candidate Obama declared that he did not believe assault weapons should be available to private citizens and he would look at reinstating the ban that ended in 2004 due to a sunset clause .
Legislators have not seriously attempted to reinstate the ban , despite several mass shootings in the US involving semi-automatic weapons .
But two weeks ago , when the flow of military - style guns from the US over the border to the Mexican drug gangs threatened to become a diplomatic issue with Mexico , Mr Obama was asked whether he still believed that assault weapons should be banned .
He does , but he added that " none of us are under any illusions " that reinstating the ban will be easy .
In other words , it is in the too - hard basket .
But that did n't placate the shoppers at the Virginia gun show .
A huge number of automatic and semi-automatic weapons are on sale and trade seems to be brisk .
I stop to admire what appears to be an M16 .
" That one , " explains the vendor , who declines to give his name , " will fire 600 rounds a minute . "
It is not allowed to be sold on the spot because it requires a special licence and background checks with the Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms administration and the FBI .
But a few stalls further down , I could pick up , for instance , a very nice semi-automatic such as an M1 carbine , used by the US military , for between $ US1000 and $ US2000 depending on the model , provided I am a resident of Virginia and I do n't have a criminal record .
I do not require a gun licence and computers are set up around the hall for instant background checks .
Loading
At the next stall down , Dale Blenkenship of Dales Guns tells me the SIG Sauer semi-automatic pistol I am admiring will cost $ US350 , but he 's disappointed when he hears I am from over the border in Maryland , because he can't sell to me .
Russell , who also does n't want to give his last name , says sales are booming because " we do n't want it to happen here like your government screwed up your country , taking your guns and freedom away from you " .
Fossil remains of a 47 - million - year - old animal , found years ago in Germany , have been analyzed more thoroughly and determined to be an extremely early primate close to the emergence of the evolutionary branch leading to monkeys , apes and humans , scientists said in interviews this week .
Described as the “ most complete fossil primate ever discovered , ” the specimen is a juvenile female the size of a small monkey .
Only the left lower limb is missing , and the preservation is so remarkable that impressions of fur and the soft body outline are still clear .
The animal ’s last meal , of fruit and leaves , remained in the stomach cavity .
In an article to be published on Tuesday in PLoS One , an online scientific journal , an international team of scientists will report that this extraordinary fossil could be a “ stem group ” from which higher primates evolved , “ but we are not advocating this . ”
The researchers said the specimen , designated Darwinius masillae , “ is important in being exceptionally well preserved and providing a much more complete understanding of the paleobiology ” of a primate from the Eocene period , a time when primitive primates were starting to branch into two lineages , the prosimians and the anthropoids .
After suffering weeks of empty legal threats over its online prostitution ads , Craigslist went on the offensive Wednesday with a federal lawsuit against South Carolina 's attorney general , seeking a restraining order that would block any further threats and prevent any criminal prosecution by the state .
Henry McMaster , the state attorney general , called the lawsuit against him " good news , " because it shows Craiglist its taking the matter seriously .
At the same time , McMaster backpedaled away from his earlier threats .
" This office and the law enforcement agencies of South Carolina will continue to monitor the site to make certain that our laws are respected , " he said in a statement .
McMaster has been blustering against Craigslist since May 5 , when he vowed to launch a criminal investigation against the site and its management , if Craigslist did not find a way to block all prostitution ads in its South Carolina section and prevent any posts containing pornographic images .
The threats came despite reforms Craigslist launched in November last year to try to stem the flow of prostitution ads .
The prosecutor gave Craigslist a May 15 deadline to block the content , and Craigslist responded last week by announcing it was closing its " erotic services " subcategory site - wide , creating a new " adult services " replacement in which every post is prescreened by staffers .
But the action did nothing to stop the threats , according to Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster , who announced the lawsuit in a blog post Wednesday .
Buckmaster said McMaster threatened prosecution as recently as Sunday .
" We opened an investigation at 5:01 on Friday , as promised , " McMaster reportedly said .
" We are preparing for a prosecution .
We are investigating .
We are moving forward . …
The No. 1 defendant is Mr. Jim Buckmaster , who is the man in charge of Craigslist .…
Craigslist is a big promoter and facilitator of prostitution . "
The company responded in court Wednesday .
" Despite Craigslist 's legal immunity from criminal or civil liability under state law for unlawful third - party content on its website , and despite the numerous good - faith actions that Craigslist has voluntarily taken to deter abuse of its service by third parties …
McMaster has persisted in threats to criminally prosecute Craigslist on the basis of third - party content appearing on the Craigslist website , " reads the company 's application for a temporary restraining order ( .pdf ) .
The lawsuit , filed in U.S. District Court in South Carolina , charges that McMaster 's threats violate Craigslist 's rights under the Communications Decency Act , a federal law that generally holds an internet forum free of liability for its users ' posts .
McMaster 's statements also harmed the site 's free - speech rights under the Constitution , and created an undue burden on interstate commerce , the lawsuit alleges .
Craigslist is seeking a temporary restraining order now , to be followed by a permanent injunction preventing further threats or prosecution .
The company is also asking for attorney fees .
There 's no doubt that an enormous amount of prostitution , including some child - sex trafficking , has unfolded on Craigslist over the years .
But Craigslist says its November reforms — including requiring " erotic services " posters to have a valid credit card — have already made a huge dent in the problem .
Because the site is largely an open forum , Craigslist can't provide 100 percent assurance that no illegal activity will be promoted in its ads , Buckmaster wrote Wednesday .
Therefore acceding to McMaster 's demands would have required that Craigslist pull out of South Carolina completely .
McMaster 's threats against Craigslist and its CEO have been toothless from the start , because the site enjoys immunity from state criminal action under the federal Communications Decency Act .
Wednesday 's lawsuit was most likely intended to put an end to the nuisance of McMaster 's tough talk , and to head off a pointless , but potentially costly , criminal case , says Marcia Hoffman , an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation , which is not a party to the lawsuit .
" I think their position is , it 's so obvious that they can't be prosecuted , it should just be barred from the outset so they do n't have to deal with it , " says Hoffman .
" Even if the criminal prosecution is baseless , they would still have to spend time and money defending it . "
In his statement Wednesday , McMaster belatedly acknowledged Craigslist 's shuttering of its erotic services category , " as we asked them to do .
And they are now taking responsibility for the content of their future advertisements .
If they keep their word , this is a victory for law enforcement and for the people of South Carolina . "
" Unfortunately , we had to inform them of possible state criminal violations concerning their past practices to produce a serious response , " he continued .
" We trust they will now adhere to the higher standards they have promised . "
Of President Obama ’s stated goals for the taxpayers ’ investment in General Motors —
“ To get G.M. back on its feet , take a hands - off approach and get out quickly ” — the middle one is likely to work against those at either end .
The government ca n’t hope to fix G.M. and sell it off without getting under the hood .
Over decades now of restructuring plans at the company , two things have demonstrably not helped get much done : Money and time .
The government ca n’t simply give more of each to the automaker .
What ’s needed is forceful , even ruthless , leadership to insist on the changes that everyone — the managers , the union leadership , the dealers , everyone — has known were necessary for about 20 years now .
Fritz Henderson , GM ’s CEO , has earned a reputation as an able guy who understands the business and the company he grew up in .
But without someone above him bringing the hammer down — repeatedly — he ’s going to have the same problem busting through the culture that frustrated his worthy predecessors , like Jack Smith .
And if the government is really going to attempt to stand back , rather than insist on a particular direction , it ’s likely only to complicate Henderson ’s job by allowing him to be buffeted by all sorts of political cross-pressures .
Already , according to The Washington Post , John Dingell has written Henderson to complain about plans to close the Willow Run Transmission Plant in Ypsilanti , Michigan , where roughly 1200 workers build four - and six - speed transmissions for rear - wheel - drive vehicles ( half the workers will be transferred to a similar plant in Toledo ) .
The stock market does n't care at the moment , but things just keep getting worse in the Treasury bond market , where yields jumped again on Tuesday , reaching fresh six - month highs .
The bullish case is that investors are abandoning Treasuries because they 're feeling better about the economy and would rather buy higher - risk assets ( junk bonds , commodities , stocks , foreign currencies , etc. ) in search of higher returns .
The Dow industrials rallied almost 200 points Tuesday .
If an easing of risk aversion is mostly what the surge in Treasury yields is about , it 's only a big problem for people who are loaded to the gills with government debt and do n't own much else .
The bearish case is that the Treasury market is warning that inflation is headed sharply higher as the Federal Reserve keeps pumping unprecedented sums into the financial system , and as Uncle Sam borrows at a record pace to fund spending .
The supply of government debt in the market will balloon further today as the U.S. sells $ 35 billion in five - year T - notes .
On Thursday the Treasury will sell $ 26 billion in seven - year notes .
As I noted in this column , the question of which ' flation to fear more -- inflation or deflation -- remains a heated debate on Wall Street .
But the inflation camp is yelling the loudest lately as Treasury yields climb .
Scott Grannis , former economist at Western Asset Management , writes on his blog that we 've reached the point where the Fed should start draining money from the financial system -- a move that seems highly unlikely , given that Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and his peers keep signaling a need to keep short - term interest rates near rock - bottom indefinitely .
Harvard economist Ken Rogoff hopes the Treasury market is indeed forecasting a big jump in inflation : Rogoff is advocating that the Fed pursue a policy to lift annual inflation to the 6 % level " for at least a couple of years , " as a way to end the deflation threat and ease the economy 's debt burden .
Debtors love inflation because it effectively shrinks the real cost of borrowed money .
A 6 % inflation rate ?
If Rogoff gets his way , we ain't seen nothing yet in the run-up in Treasury yields :
Even the longest - term bond , the 30 - year T - bond , is yielding just shy of 4.5 % .
Investors presumably will want a lot more yield than that if they think they see a big inflation bump on the horizon .

People get tired of me writing about Republican Congressman Ron Paul .
Hell , I get tired of me writing about Ron Paul .
Sometimes I feel guilty about it .
I try to avoid it more than you might imagine .
But there ’s good reason I can’t .
A growing number of Republicans now seem willing to join Paul , not just to tweak big government or diddle with marginal tax rates , but to attack the root problem of spending and even heart of the U.S. monetary system , the Federal Reserve .
“ End the Fed ! ” yelled so many tea partiers recently .
Paul ’s bill HR 1207 to audit the Federal Reserve now has 143 cosponsors and that number continues to rise .

A new study which randomized 638 adults to either standard acupuncture , individualized acupuncture , placebo acupuncture using tooth picks that did not penetrate the skin , and standard therapy found exactly what previous evidence has also suggested – it does not seem to matter where you stick the needles or even if you stick the needles through the skin .
The only reasonable scientific conclusion to draw from this is that acupuncture does not work .
But let me back up a minute .
Imagine if we were evaluating the efficacy of a new pain drug .
This drug , when tested in open trials ( no blinding or control ) has an effect on reducing pain – it is superior to no treatment .
When compared to a placebo , however , the drug is no more effective than the placebo , although both are more effective than no treatment .
Now imagine that the pharmaceutical company who manufactures this drug sends out a press release declaring that their drug is effective for pain , but that their research shows that a placebo of their drug is also effective ( FDA applications are pending ) .
Therefore more research is needed to determine how their drug works .
Would you buy it ?
That is the exact situation we are facing with acupuncture research .
Acupuncture is the traditional Chinese medicine practice of placing thin needles to a specific depth through the skin in specific acupuncture points in order to treat illness and relieve symptoms .
Claims for acupuncture , including the number and location of acupuncture points , have changed greatly over the centuries , but there is no scientific evidence base for any of these claims .
Acupuncture is philosophy - based medicine , not science - based medicine .
The presumed mechanism for acupuncture , according to TCM , is that the needles unblock the flow of chi ( life energy ) through the body .
Acupuncture points are supposed to corresponds to the pathways through which chi flow , correlating to specific organs or functions in the body .
Modern proponents of acupuncture come in two basic flavors – those who promote so - called medical acupuncture , and those who restrict their claims to symptomatic relief of pain , nausea , and other symptoms .
Medical acupuncture is the claim that acupuncture can actually treat real medical diseases , like cancer .
It is dependent entirely on the TCM philosophy of acupuncture , including the flow of chi .
Medical acupuncture is pure pseudoscience without any basis in science or evidence and does not require further consideration .
Some proponents of symptomatic acupuncture have divorced their claims from the original philosophy of acupuncture , claiming that the needling works through more prosaic mechanisms , such as the release of pain - relieving endorphins or through nerve stimulation .
While these explanations are plausible , they are post - hoc speculations and have not been demonstrated to occur to a clinically relevant degree .
But before we speculate about possible mechanism , we need to establish that acupuncture has an effect – that it works for some specific indication .
This has not been established , despite rather robust clinical research efforts .
If there were not a cultural inertia to the notion of acupuncture the existing research would have been sufficient to abandon this modality as a dead end .
To understand the clinical research into acupuncture we need to understand how clinical scientific studies work .
Typically they are designed to isolate specific variables to measure the effect , if any , of those specific variable .
That is the purpose of using controls – comparing an active treatment to an inactive treatment or some other intervention .
Subjects are randomized to control or treatment so that other variables will , on average , cancel each other out .
Larger numbers are required for randomization to work , so larger trials are better .
And subjects and evaluators are blinded to treatment so that psychological biases will be factored out .
A well - designed trial , therefore , isolates the specific treatment variable to see what effect it has .
There are two treatment variables when it comes to acupuncture .
( Actually , there can be more if we include other treatments that use acupuncture , such as giving electrical stimulation through acupuncture needles – but those variables should be considered separately and they are not acupuncture itself . )
The two variables specific to acupuncture are sticking needles through the skin , and the locations on the body where the needles are placed .
Here is the key to understanding acupuncture research – when these two variables are properly isolated the evidence shows that there is no measurable effect from either .
It does not matter where you stick the needles , or even if you stick them through the skin .
Since these two variables are specific to acupuncture it is safe to conclude that acupuncture does not work .
This latest study , one of the largest to date , supports this conclusion .
The three acupuncture arms – placing needles in a standard pattern , placing needles in an individualized pattern according to acupuncture philosophy , and touching the skin with tooth picks without penetrating the skin – showed almost exactly the same degree of symptom relief both short and long term .
However , all three treatments were more effective than standard therapy .
The authors conclude :
Although acupuncture was found effective for chronic low back pain , tailoring needling sites to each patient and penetration of the skin appear to be unimportant in eliciting therapeutic benefits .
These findings raise questions about acupuncture ’s purported mechanisms of action .
It remains unclear whether acupuncture or our simulated method of acupuncture provide physiologically important stimulation or represent placebo or nonspecific effects .
The first sentence is misleading , that acupuncture was found to be effective .
This is based entirely on the fact that the three acupuncture arms showed more effect than the standard treatment arm .
However , this was not a blinded comparison , and did not control for al the nonspecific aspects of acupuncture treatment .
The second sentence is correct but understated .
This study ( and others with similar results ) does not just call into question the purported mechanisms of action of acupuncture – it blows them out of the water .
The final sentence is the meat of the conclusion , but again is trying to tip toe over the obvious scientific conclusion .
The authors recognize that the results of their study are consistent with placebo or nonspecific effects , without the need to invoke any specific effects from acupuncture itself .
But I would say that this study , combined with other studies , does not leave the question “ unclear ” – it makes is very clear that there are no specific effects from acupuncture , and any effects are either due to placebo effects or are a response to the therapeutic ritual surrounding the delivery of acupuncture .
These nonspecific effects may derive from the attention of the acupuncturist , the relaxing atmosphere in which the treatment is given , and the expectations derived from introducing a novel modality into treatment .
These are variables known to have a symptomatic effect .
Therefore if you give treatment X plus these nonspecific effects you will measure a symptomatic benefit .
Treatment X can only be said to work if it provides symptomatic benefit in excess of these other variables – which acupuncture does not .
And yet the news reports of this study almost invariably declare that “ Tooth pick acupuncture works ” or that “ Acupuncture , real or fake , helps aching back . ”
They are all buying the deceptive press release .
This study was not designed and is not capable of showing that “ fake acupuncture works ” any more than a negative drug trial shows that “ sugar pills relieve pain . ”
This is because , as the authors admit , you cannot separate out the nonspecific and placebo effects from the acupuncture treatment .
The spin that acupuncture proponents are placing on this type of evidence turns scientific logic onto its head .
In the scientific literature the authors need to be more circumspect , probably to get past peer - review .
But then to the lay press the spin begins .
Study author , Dr. Daniel Cherkin , is quoted as saying :
“ We found that simulated acupuncture , without penetrating the skin , produced as much benefit as needle acupuncture – and that raises some new questions about how acupuncture works . ”
This is wrong – these results call into question if acupuncture works .
Conclusion
Once again we see that the best acupuncture clinical trials show that it does not matter where or if you place the needles .
Since these are the two interventions specific to acpuncture , we can conclude ( confidently , at this point ) that acupuncture does not work and that any perceived benefit from acupucture is due to placebo or nonspecific effects .
The acupuncture industry needs to be called on their continued promotion of a medical modality which has already been shown to be ineffective by clinical research .
The mainstream media needs to be criticized for uncritically accepting the propaganda of the acupuncture industry .

Mary Lou Jepsen is a tech necromancer who battled the odds to conjure up a product that most experts said could n't be built : a $ 100 laptop ( give or take a few twenties ) .
Now she 's back , with plans for low - cost , low - power , super - readable , LCD - based screens that will go into everything from e-book readers to netbooks and computers .
" We are creating e-paper with color and video capability , but on high volume , standard , mass production lines , so they will be available easily , " says Jepsen , founder of Pixel Qi ( pronounced Pixel Chee ) , a San Bruno , California - based startup .
The company plans to have samples of its display out within the next two months , " and we are pulling all - nighters now to get the product ready . "
Jepsen was the chief technical officer and first employee of the One Laptop per Child 's XO computer , and she was charged with making the cheap computer technically feasible .
A low - power LCD was the cornerstone of that effort .
Now , Jepsen wants to take her OLPC experience – and her 48 display - related patents – to market with a for - profit company .
Pixel Qi's displays called 3 Qi will operate in three settings : a full - color , bright , conventional LCD mode ; a very low - power , sunlight - readable , reflective e-paper mode ; and a low - power , basic color transflective mode .
The screens are initially expected to be available in 10.5 - inch and 7.5 - inch screen sizes .
If successful , the 3 Qi displays could effectively bridge the high - speed , full - color benefits of traditional LCDs and the low - power , reader - friendly qualities of electronic ink displays .
The market for electronic ink is currently led by Cambridge , Massachusetts - based E Ink , whose extremely low power , sunlight - readable electrophoretic displays are used in the majority of e-book readers today , including the successful Amazon.com Kindle and Kindle 2 .
However , despite the readability of E Ink 's screens , the displays take a second or two to refresh , making them unsuitable for video or animation .
Also , they are currently only available in monochrome .
" Effectively what [ Pixel Qi is ] doing is creating a hybrid display that combines the best of E Ink and regular LCDs , " says Robert Barry , director of business development for Team Research , a company that makes an e-book reader called the Astak Mentor .
Team Research has partnered with Pixel Qi to include the latter 's display into a new e-book reader codenamed ' Spectrum . '
There 's just one problem : Although Jepsen has said that the first 3 Qi displays will be available later this year , no one has seen a working prototype of a Pixel Qi display yet .
That means Jepsen will have to first prove Pixel Qi's claims even as she steers the company through one of the most difficult economic environments for a startup .
Since Amazon introduced the Kindle in November 2007 , the e-books reader market has taken off in a big way .
This year alone , Amazon introduced two new e-book readers , the Kindle 2 and Kindle DX .
Other companies such as Sony , Samsung , Fujitsu and Foxit are also fighting for a share of this fast - growing market .
To succeed in the e-book market , Pixel Qi will have to break E Ink 's near monopoly on the market .
Jepsen is counting on a two - pronged strategy to break that stranglehold .
First , Pixel Qi plans to use existing LCD production lines to manufacture the displays at a high volume and extremely low cost .
Second , the company is betting its displays will be much more more versatile than E Ink's ( for instance , they can display color and video ) and can be used to power netbooks and tablet PCs .
Potentially , a 3 Qi display could make a netbook or tablet do double duty as an e-book reader .
" When people design a new computer chip there 's a good reason they still use silicon as a material though there are other options , " says Jepsen .
" They can try something new but it will take a lot longer to bring it to market .
I think it 's the same with displays . "
That 's why Pixel Qi's displays are based on LCD technology , says Jepsen .
" The LCD manufacturing industry is a $ 100 billion a year business and is cost - optimized in a way that is very hard for E Ink to scale to , " she says .
" The problem has been that no small entity got access to the big LCD production lines .
But we have cracked the door open on the LCD factories just like the smaller guys did with the silicon fabs . "
To pull off her plans with Pixel Q , Jepsen is counting heavily on her previous experience as the founding chief technology officer and the first employee of the One Laptop Per Child project .
The project aimed to bring $ 100 laptops to children in developing countries .
Jepsen helped create the OLPC laptop 's display technology and its ultra - low - power management system .
As OLPC laptops went into large scale production , Jepsen resigned from the project to start Pixel Qi in late 2007 .
" She 's very smart and very energetic , " says Jennifer Cosgrove , director at research firm Display Search .
" She has relationships with display manufacturers in Taiwan from the OLPC project and she has worked hard to persuade many of them to be part of her new idea . "
But Pixel Qi has been a greater challenge than Jepsen may have realized .
The company completed its first round ( Series A ) funding two months ago .
It has n't disclosed its investors or how much it has raised , though Jepsen says getting investors for Pixel Qi has been the biggest challenge of her career .
The LCD and display industry has become " incredibly risk averse , " says Jepsen , and convincing companies to bet on her idea has been " ridiculously hard . "
" It was harder for me to get money for this venture than for art school , " Jepsen says .
" I can't say we did n't think of shutting down .
There were an awful lot of moments we thought we would n't make it . "
What 's holding Pixel Qi together is the promise of the screens that Jepsen and her team say they will deliver .
For now , though , Jepsen wo n't talk much about what she says is the " secret sauce " of her new display screens .
" We have really , really focused on the details of the different layers that go to create the OLPC screens and how we can put them together differently to create a new kind of display , " she says .
" What I have done is massively improve on the OLPC display design . "
Despite the lack of extensive information or prototype , Pixel Qi's partners are keeping the faith .
Team Research 's Barry says that Pixel Qi's technology checks out .
Early versions of his company 's Spectrum are expected to be ready around October and he plans to show them at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2010 .
But even Barry has n't seen a prototype 3 Qi display yet .
In other words , even though Pixel Qi has yet to deliver the first sample of its display , Team Research is already scheduling a future product release around it .
The reason , says Barry , is that Pixel Qi will offer color displays , something its rivals including E Ink are still struggling to bring to market .
" The race in the e-book reader market is now for a color display , " says Barry .
" Everyone 's looking for a technology that will allow long battery life with color . "
Though E
Ink is currently working on a color display it is unlikely to have it available till mid-2010 , says Display Search 's Cosgrove .
" E
Ink has shown some demos of color displays but they are not close to high volume production , " she says .
" E Ink displays also can't do video very well because the response time for display is pretty slow . "
Cosgrove pegs response time for E
Ink displays at about 200 milliseconds and says she expects Pixel Qi's displays to show average response time between 5 ms and 30 ms .
As the e-book readers market matures , companies are likely to seek a second display supply source and Pixel Qi could emerge as a viable alternative to E Ink .
Jepsen is also counting on sheer innovation to help drive sales .
Netbook manufacturers are hungry for new ideas to help them stand out in an increasingly crowded and price - sensitive market .
" We are the only sort of new display screen that the market has seen in a long time , " says Jepsen .
" There 's not been much innovation in this business . "

Do you support the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes ?
I was taking this online poll at The Chicago Tribune about medical marijuana and the wording got me thinking : Naturally , over 90 % said yes because only a small number of really difficult people still have a problem with medical marijuana .
But what do these people even mean that they do n't " support the use of marijuana for medical purposes ? "
There are FDA approved medications with the same active ingredient as marijuana .
Saying " marijuana is n't medicine " is n't an opinion , it 's a factual error .
Really , the poll question might as well read :

" One Ring to Rule them All ... and in the Darkness Bind Them . " - from J.R.R. Tolkien 's ' The Lord of the Rings '
When I talk to people who have never even heard of the Federal Reserve , I often use an analogy based on the above quote from The Lord of the Rings trilogy .
( That is after I first disavow them of the notion that the dollar is loosely backed by gold , which even I will admit believing was true just two years ago . )
( Photo courtesy Playadura license )
Today 's FED is a group of bankers who have the " Money Power " over all other banks and the money supply .
This awesome power is like that of Tolkien 's One Ring , which controlled all of the other Rings of Power worn by men , elves , and dwarves .
Can you imagine what YOU could do if you could snap currency into existence simply by writing a check to yourself ?
I 've described this money power here " The Money Matrix - How the FED Works ( PART 6/15 ) " .
Washington , DC is like Mount Doom .
It is the only place that the Ring can be unmade , destroyed , and the money power returned to We the People .
Only the Congress or the Supreme Court has the power to abolish the FED , and the battle royale of the moment is simply to audit the FED via HR 1207 .
Frodo Baggins is no other than Congressman Ron Paul ( R - TX ) .
For most of his political career spanning 30 years , he has been isolated , sounding the clarion call for honest money from the fraudulent bankers upon the deaf ears of his fellow lawmakers .
He has been struggling to place the banker 's precious Ring in the fires of Mount Doom , and return prosperity to the land by ridding it of an evil , barbarous , immoral relic , the FED .
Faithful Sam Gamgee is none other than those who support the ideas of Ron Paul , and assist him in his quest to unmake the bankster 's evil Ring .
It is people like Adam Kokesh of New Mexico and RJ Harris of Oklahoma , both stalwart veterans of the War on Terror , who have returned home to save their country by running for US Congress .
It is people like Ron 's son , Dr. Rand Paul of Kentucky , who will likely run for US Senate next year .
It is certainly like all those who have phone and emailed their Representatives to support HR 1207 .
And it is even people like me , just an engineer , willing to take on a multi-million dollar Duopoly party election machine and run for US Congress , starting with just a pen and my voice simply because I have a message to share and I refuse to live any other way .

" On account of [ the Federal Reserve ] , we ourselves are in the midst of the greatest depression we have ever known .
From the Atlantic to the Pacific , our Country has been ravaged and laid waste by the evil practices of the Fed and the interests which control them .
At no time in our history , has the general welfare of the people been at a lower level or the minds of the people so full of despair ...
They are the victims of the Fed .
Their children are the new slaves of the auction blocks in the revival of the institution of human slavery . "
- Congressman Louis T. McFadden , Pennsylvania 's 15th District , from the 1934 Congressional Record ( photo )
_________________________________________________________________________
For some historical context , central banks are nothing new to the United States .
Heroes of liberty have been constantly fighting to eliminate them since our nation 's founding .
Previously , like in the case of President Andrew Jackson 's stirring presidential campaign , the central bank was soundly defeated and abolished in 1832 .
As Rothbard writes in The Case Against the FED , in the 1800s , American banks were still fairly independent after the honest - money Democratic President , Andrew Jackson , literally " routed out " the central bank in 1832 until Lincoln 's Republicans expanding the banker 's powers with the National Banking System during the Civil War .
( Rothbard , p. 78-83/162 ) ( photo )
When the Wall Street bankers of the late 1800s dreamed up the FED , they were doing so because under the NBS they were not able to inflate ( or drop the purchasing power of the dollar by expanding the money supply , in the process making everyone poorer ) evenly across all banks .
The next and ongoing incarnation , the Federal Reserve , was established by Congress 's Federal Reserve Act of 1913 .
Representative McFadden brought formal impeachment charges against the Federal Reserve Board of Governors , the Comptroller of the Currency and the Secretary of the Treasury charging them with theft , fraud and treason , among others .
Congressman McFadden was almost certainly murdered by those he opposed .
By happenstance , I grew up in McFadden 's congressional district and recently returned from abroad to run for his former office in 2010 .
What is the cost of freedom ?
Did you think that freedom was free ?
That merely being born in the USA is enough to lay your claim to freedom ?
America was once a sanctuary for the poor , the hungry , the oppressed and downtrodden to make better lives for themselves .
However , our government has been slowly replacing the psychological shackles that some of our forefathers initially fled Europe and elsewhere to escape .
Our government has been slowly fastening the same iron shackles that some of our forefathers wore when they arrived from Africa .
It is time for this farce to end .
Led by the Gray Champion , freedom will come to our land once again if the people recognize that yet again we are all oppressed , that we all wear a gigantic ball and chain that is our monetary system and idiotic government behavior .
If monetary policy must be the first shackle that draws noticeably amounts of blood before the chains are broken , so be it .

As this short cartoon - apparently from 50 years ago - shows , it is time to stand up like John Q. Public and defend your country from the ISM potion that is currently being force - fed to us by the powers - that - be if our country is to recover its prosperity .
The price of liberty is eternal vigilance , and it's not all that expensive we pay it together .
Help me and the others in the rEVOLution pay this toll .
In the coming 18 months , if all goes well , We the People in my home district will have earned the nickname of the Fighting Fifteenth !

CHURCH RESPONSE :A SENIOR Vatican figure , Spanish Cardinal Antonio Canizares , prefect for the Congregation of the Divine Worship , this week appeared to downplay the findings of the Ryan report when suggesting that the millions of lives lost through abortion represent a much more serious crime against humanity than clerical sex abuse .
Speaking on Catalan channel , TV 3 , Cardinal Canizares , said the behaviour of some Catholic priests and nuns in Ireland was to be totally condemned and that they had committed crimes “ for which we have to ask forgiveness ” .
Speaking in the context of an abortion debate prompted by a Spanish government proposal , the cardinal said : “ What happened in some schools cannot be compared with the millions of lives that have been destroyed by abortion .
It ( abortion ) has legally destroyed 40 million human lives . ”

Thousands of baby kangaroos to be clubbed to death in new Australian government ruling
Animal rights activists are outraged at a decision that will permit thousands of baby kangaroos to be slaughtered .
The regional government of New South Wales has announced a cull after a severe drought drove kangaroos into residential areas .
Up to 15 per cent of the population will be targeted , authorities say .
But animal welfare groups are horrified over guidelines that state orphaned joeys should be decapitated , shot or clubbed to death .
Culled :
A new ruling will see thousands of orphaned joeys legitimately clubbed to death in New South Wales
Nikki Sutterby , of the Australian Society for Kangaroos , said four million kangaroos and hundreds of thousands of young were being killed in the country 's commercial shooting industry every year .
' If we estimate that a third of the 150,000 kangaroos to be killed are females and half of them have a joey , that works out to 25,000 joeys to be decapitated , bashed to death or shot each year , ' she said .
' There are already almost four million kangaroos commercially killed in Australia annually .
Do the same sums and you realise hundreds of thousands of joeys are being killed horribly each year . '
Official guidelines for hunters say that hairless joeys should be decapitated or bludgeoned to death while older joeys should be beaten to death or shot .
A spokesman for the Department of Environment and Climate Change claimed that rescuing orphaned joeys would overwhelm animal welfare groups .
The number of adult kangaroos to be shot in the state each year has been described as a ' sustainable 15 per cent ' of the one million eastern grey kangaroos .
Animal rights groups agree that kangaroo numbers have to be kept down so they do not suffer through lack of food but they say the manner in which the young are killed is ' sickening ' .
Miss Sutterby added : ' They do n't want to allow joeys to be rescued because it would expose the dirty secrets of the industry . '
The Australian arm of the Human Society International said : ' Clubbing and decapitation of joeys is one of the forgotten cruelties of kangaroo hunting . '
But the RSPCA said it reluctantly accepted the decapitation and clubbing of joeys after two thorough investigations of the commercial kangaroo industry .
The alternative would be to leave the young to be hunted down by predators such as dingoes and hawks .
They would also perish from thirst and starvation , it said .
John Lyle , who with his wife Sandra cares for orphaned joeys at his home in the New South Wales outback , said he had asked the government if wildlife officials could be present when kangaroos were shot so they could check for joeys .
' They said they had tried it and it did n't work , ' said Mr Lyle .
' More likely , they did n't want the public to see how many joeys are orphaned due to the shooting , ' he added .
Porsche , which last year thought its " hedge fund " division was smarter than all the actual hedge funds in the world and with the implicit complicity of the BaFin created the Volkswagen squeeze monster , might very soon be at the mercy of the same hedge funds it nearly guillotined .
As Zero Hedge reported , the failed merger between it and Volkswagen ( so much for domination ) , is likely going to be just the beginning of the company 's problems .
The first thing Porsche has to be worried about is the fact that it will now be unable to secure a credit rating for itself by the time the self imposed May 31 deadline rolls .
The company , which had recently been exclusively focused on containing the failed merger fallout , kinda forgot that absent a credit rating , the spread on its existing € 10 billion loan will increase by 100 bps to EURIBOR + 425 : 1 % on 10 billion is not something to sneeze at .
A report by Loan Pricing Corporation cites a Porsche spokesman who said " It makes no sense at the moment to try to get a rating .
" Amusingly , bankers who were stuck holding the massive loan , had hoped the 100 bps penalty would be sufficient incentive for the company to push for the rating , which would in turn allow it to refinance the loans with a bond issue .
As it stands , the banks will end up holding a whole lot of secured loans , which , if Angela Merkel has her way , will get the same " super priority " treatment as secured lenders just got in the Chrysler bankruptcy .
Not only this , but additionally Porsche was expecting to raise an additional , and much needed , € 2.5 billion loan by the end of May , which plan is now also on the scrap heap - according to bankers the car company has only managed to generate interest for €750 million of the total amount , which will also now likely be pulled as the expected merger is prematurely over .
As Porsche has managed to make a lot of friends in the hedge fund community , it is unable to solicit even usurious indications of interest from a rescue financing source : although , it would be very amusing to watch Dan Loeb or Larry Robbins lend Porsche € 2.5 billion at a 150 % rate ( with a 200 % cash flow sweep ) .
Instead , Porsche said on Tuesday that it was holding " promising talks " with a potential Middle East investor .
Then again , Dubai is in such a flourishing economic condition , that it likely cant wait to hit " accept " on the fund flow button and hand over its last semblance of liquidity .
Just goes to show , that on Wall Street , no massive short squeeze goes unpunished ... And also to think twice before you burn all bridges with the hedge fund community ... The last is particularly relevant for Mr. Steven Rattner .

Über die Durchsuchung beim Inhaber der Domain wikileaks .
de wurde schon gestern viel berichtet .
Als Anwalt des Betroffenen konnte ich den Sachverhalt heute so weit klären , dass wir wenigstens wissen , um was es geht .
Theodor R. wird vorgeworfen , Beihilfe zum Vertreiben von kinderpornografischen Schriften zu leisten .
Und zwar dadurch , dass er seine Domain wikileaks .
de schlicht und einfach auf die Internetseite wikileaks.org umleitet .
Die Begründung : Auf der verlinkten Startseite von wikileaks.org findet sich unter anderem ein Link zu einer australischen Sperrliste .
Diese Sperrliste ist auf Wikileaks nicht nur zum Download als reiner Text verfügbar ( Download - Bereich im oberen Teil ) .
Sondern die Liste ist auf der verlinkten Seite im unteren Bereich nochmals wiedergegeben .
Mit einem Unterschied : Die gesperrten Internetseiten sind dort per Hyperlink verknüpft .
Die Polizei hat im Auftrag der Staatsanwaltschaft Dresden die Links stichprobenartig überprüft .
Es sollen sich kinderpornografische und damit in Deutschland strafbare Angebote darunter befinden .
Auch wenn die Staatsanwaltschaft den Vorwurf derzeit noch nicht abschließend bejaht , einen Anfangsverdacht gegen meinen Mandanten sieht sie jedenfalls .
Denn es komme in Betracht , dass sich , wer auf eine andere Domain weiterleitet , die dann unmittelbar erreichbaren Inhalte zurechenbar zu eigen macht , jedenfalls deren Erreichbarkeit fördert und damit das Verbreiten der Inhalte unterstützt .
Es gibt ein Urteil , das zumindest auf erste Sicht diese Auffassung bestätigt .
Es handelt sich um die Entscheidung des Oberlandesgerichts Stuttgart im Prozess gegen den Internetaktivisten Alvar Freude .
Dieser hatte Links zu rechtsradikalen Seiten gesetzt , um diese Szene zu entlarven .
Das Oberlandesgericht
Stuttgart bejahte seine grundsätzliche Haftung für die von ihm gesetzten Links .
Freigesprochen wurde Freude letztlich , weil für ihn die im Gesetz vorgesehene Sozialadäquanzklausel griff .
Dieser Befreiungstatbestand gilt aber nur für strafbare verfassungsfeindliche Schriften und Symbole , nicht aber für Kinderpornografie .
Ebenso wie die Staatsanwaltschaft habe auch ich die rechtliche Bewertung der Sache noch nicht abgeschlossen .
Es gibt eine Vielzahl von Argumenten , die auch im Fall der Weiterleitung auf wikileaks.org gegen eine Strafbarkeit sprechen .
Allerdings bedeutet das Vorgehen der Staatsanwaltschaft ein Alarmsignal für jeden , der einen Link auf wikileaks.org gesetzt hat .
Wer nach dort verlinkt , leitet auch weiter und setzt sich , das ist kein Scherz , demselben Verdacht aus wie mein Mandant , der wegen dieser Sache eine Hausdurchsuchung bei Nacht und Nebel über sich ergehen lassen musste .
Wenn man dann weiß , dass die Polizeiaktion nach dem Anruf einer „ besorgten Bürgerin “ binnen kürzester Zeit ins Rollen kam , kann man sich alles weitere ausmalen .
Mein Mandant hat sich dafür entschieden , die Weiterleitung nicht aufzuheben .
Er ist entschlossen , die Sache rechtlich zu klären .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Obama administration will make about $ 500 million available to Chrysler LLC through the end of this month as it seeks to reach an alliance with Fiat , and up to $ 5 billion through May to help General Motors Corp restructure outside of bankruptcy , an independent oversight report on the Treasury Department ’s corporate rescue fund said on Tuesday .

Separately , the United Auto Workers ( UAW ) union urged its members to lobby the White House by phone or email to ensure that workers and retirees are treated fairly in negotiations at both companies on new concessions , which are considered vital for the automakers ’ to survive .
“ We need President ( Barack ) Obama and his auto task force to stand up for the interests of workers and retirees in these restructuring negotiations , ” the union said in an appeal on its Web site to members .
The UAW represents about 26,000 workers at Chrysler and 62,000 at GM .
The union is under pressure along with bondholders and banks to help Chrysler and GM slash debt so they can restructure .
The central issue for the UAW and the car companies is reaching an accord on restructuring the finances of a multi-billion - dollar retiree health care trust .
The administration ’s task force does not believe Chrysler can stand alone and is brokering meetings this week in Washington and Detroit to see if a deal with Fiat is possible .
The administration has offered up to $ 6 billion to help finance the alliance that would give Chrysler access to Fiat ’s small car technology and the Italian automaker a platform for building light trucks and a robust network for selling its vehicles in the United States .
Analysts and consultants have questioned whether the companies can close the deal and avert what most believe would be a certain Chrysler bankruptcy .
At the White House on Monday , Obama ’s chief spokesman , Robert Gibbs , would not forecast where the talks were headed but said the administration was working “ with all of the stakeholders involved ” and was hopeful a solution would be found to “ continue the Chrysler brand ” and strengthen the industry overall .
“ The President continues to be involved in this issue and understanding the tremendous economic importance both for the overall industry and for the dozens of communities throughout the country that are dependent upon Chrysler and auto parts suppliers that supply Chrysler for good - paying jobs , ” Gibbs said .
The administration in March set aside up to $ 500 million to help Chrysler get through April , according to a report on oversight of corporate bailout funds prepared by the Treasury Department inspector general .
GM was slated to receive up to $ 5 billion through May .
GM said on Monday it would cut another 1,600 salaried jobs by May 1 .
The reductions are part of GM ’s plan to slash its global salaried work force this year by about 10,000 , or 14 percent .
GM also aims to cut 37,000 hourly jobs worldwide by the end of the year .
GM and Chrysler , controlled by Cerberus Capital Management , received a $ 17.4 billion government bailout in December .
Ford Motor
Co is also struggling but opted against seeking rescue funds .

" If you are an economist and did not see this coming , you should seriously reconsider the value of your education … "
" What Good Are Economists Anyway ? " asks BusinessWeek 's April 27 , 2009 cover story .
The article makes the important point that , since most economists failed to predict the current crisis , the worst economic collapse in nearly 80 years , we need to consider whether or not their work has any value .
Unfortunately , after bringing this failure to our attention , the article , written by economics editor Peter Coy , concludes that it 's important to accept advice from the same economists who demonstrated their incompetence by not seeing this financial collapse in advance .
Peter Coy begins by quoting some noneconomists critical of the economics profession .
Fans of Mises.org , I suspect , would tend to applaud these observations .
Coy appears to be unaware of the Austrian School of thought and his assessment applies to the mainstream of the economics profession .
First , a blogger is quoted as saying ,
" If you are an economist and did not see this coming , you should seriously reconsider the value of your education and maybe do something with a tangible value to society , like picking vegetables . "
He 's right .
Few economists saw this crisis coming , and many economists openly argued that there would be no recession .
Such economists should question the investment they have made in their education .
Society would be better off if these economists accepted work outside of the economics profession where they could produce something of value , and , more importantly , they could stop harming society with their destructive economic views .
Nassim Nicholas Taleb , author of The Black Swan , says , " We have to build a society that does n't depend on the forecasts by idiotic economists . "
Taleb is also right .
Some economists — those versed in Austrian business - cycle theory — did predict this crisis .
Those who did n't see it coming might be considered " idiotic . "
Next , finance expert Paul Wilmott asserts that " Economists ' models are just awful .
They completely forget how important the human element is . "
Right again .
Mainstream economists depend on mathematical models for understanding economic relationships .
The false precision of the models may give them intellectual comfort , but the models provide a mechanical view of economic decision making .
While Austrian theorists are focused on human action ( Austrians call this analysis " praxeology " ) , the modelers overlook the purposeful behavior of decision making .
Models fail to incorporate the full spectrum of human decisions , giving us , at best , an incomplete view of economic relationships ( for an explanation of the limitations of economic modeling , see Gene Callahan 's " Models : What Are They Good For ? " ) .
Recent events show that models can show us trends in economic variables , but have difficulty predicting changes in these trends .
The BusinessWeek article also takes a swipe at the last two chairmen of the Federal Reserve .
Coy notes that before the collapse , Alan Greenspan argued that there was no housing bubble , and admitted in his Senate testimony last year that his earlier pronouncements regarding the soundness of our economy were flawed .
Coy also quotes current Fed chairman Ben Bernanke .
In a 2002 speech commemorating Milton Friedman 's 90th birthday , Bernanke noted the Fed 's role in the Great Depression , addressing Friedman : " You 're right , we did it .
We 're very sorry .
But thanks to you , we wo n't do it again . "
That was a false promise .
Under the leadership of Greenspan and Bernanke , they have done it again .
In fact , they were doing it , pumping up the economy just as they did in the 1920s , at the time of Bernanke 's quote .
Given the events of the last year , that statement alone shows that Bernanke does not understand what caused or what will solve this crisis .
– Nassim Nicholas Taleb ,
author of The Black Swan " We have to build a society that does n't depend on the forecasts by idiotic economists . "
Because of economists ' demonstrated incompetence , Coy is tempted " to ignore the whole profession . "
But , according to Coy , " that wo n't do . "
He concludes that in order to recover from this crisis , we must listen to the best economists , and by that he means the top mainstream economists .
To make his case that economists have made important contributions to society , Coy points to research from the 1970s that shows " the importance of having a strong , independent central bank " in order to eliminate chronic high inflation .
Coy 's brief defense of central banking indicates that he does not link the current financial collapses to Federal Reserve policy .
The Federal Reserve pumped large amounts of newly created money into credit markets , much of which went into the housing and stock markets .
The artificially low interest rates generated by these policies caused malinvestments ; the downturn occurs when investors realize their mistakes .
A strong central bank is the creator of , not the cure for , inflation and the business cycle ( for more on the Austrian view of the financial crisis , see the Mises.org Bailout Reader ) .
" A strong central bank is the creator of , not the cure for , inflation and the business cycle . "
Coy wants us to follow the " very best thinking of a generation . "
While he does n't specifically say who the best thinkers are , Coy 's article mentions several top mainstream economists , including recent Nobel Prize winner and hyper-Keynesian Paul Krugman .
While these economists do not escape criticism , Coy argues that the profession ( apparently meaning these economists ) needs to come to an understanding about the cause of this crisis and lead us out of the recession .
The " next agenda for macroeconomists will be to help make the economy far more robust — enough to survive the blunders of politicians , bankers , and economists of the future . "
First of all , making the economy robust falls outside the job description of any economist ; second , we cannot construct an economy that will withstand future attacks from political operatives and central bankers .
On the plus side , Coy leaves us with a story that should make us skeptical about Obama 's Keynesian stimulus program :
As World War II ended , many economists worried that growth would lapse as military spending fell .
Sewell Avery , the CEO of Montgomery Ward , was so anxious about a postwar depression that he refused to open new stores .
Economists still are n't sure why he was wrong , so they can't say reliably whether fiscal stimulus will end this recession or just interrupt it .
The post–World War II economy tells us why the government 's current program to stimulate the economy by spending trillions of dollars of revenues generated by borrowing and creating new money will fail .
As Robert Higgs has shown , when the federal government drastically cut spending after World War II , the economy boomed .
The recovery from the Great Depression was due to the reduction of government spending after the war .
Reducing the amount of government predations ( Murray Rothbard 's term for the government burdens on the economy ) improves productive economic activity just as the massive increases in predations today will harm our economy .
The economists who worried at that time that spending cuts would lead to a recession were wrong , just as the economists who are now in positions of political leadership are wrong about the causes and cure for the current panic .
$ 29 $ 21 " One school of thought , the Austrian School , foresaw this downturn . "
BusinessWeek has done us a favor by pointing out that most economists continue to accept the very theories that prevented them from anticipating the financial collapse .
However , the magazine errs in concluding that we should now listen to those same economists .
It would make more sense to ignore those economists that not only failed to predict but also had a hand in creating the crisis .
BusinessWeek would have done their readers a favor if they had pointed out that one school of thought , the Austrian School , foresaw this downturn and understands how markets will correct the errors of the central bankers .
The magazine should have advised their readers to listen to Congressman Ron Paul and financial advisor Peter Schiff , and pointed their readers to the writings of Ludwig von Mises ( The Theory of Money and Credit ) , F.A. Hayek ( Prices and Production ) , Murray Rothbard ( America 's Great Depression ) , Jesus Huerta de Soto ( Money , Bank Credit , and Economic Cycles ) , and Tom Woods ( Meltdown ) .
" Obviously , playing in Florida I did n't have any rain gear in the bag , so that option went out of the window and I felt that if I could hack it out , I could secure a five and that is what I did , " said Stenson .
The Australian Government employs about 237,000 public servants .
Not one of them is planning for the country to make a complete transition to renewable energy or even seriously envisaging such a scenario .
A spokesman for the Prime Minister confirmed this week a clean energy future is not on our agenda , even as an option - not for 2020 , not for 2050 , not at all , even though thousands of people will march around Australia today demanding just that .
As a result most of us are completely in the dark as to whether there is potentially enough renewable energy to go around and at what cost .
We are held hostage to the argument that coal and nuclear are the only credible options for " baseload power " .
It would be prudent at least to work up a plausible transition - to - clean - energy scenario , because a tipping point is looming and the public 's patience will not last forever .
As soon as 2013 , we face the total loss of Arctic summer sea ice .
A blue North Pole will be more than a psychological shock - cue media frenzy , photos from space , political promises , sceptical blathering etc .
Gordon Brown talks much about his Presbyterian past , but he has a story to tell - about personal morality , a sense of justice and a belief in the power of politics that does , at its best , appeal to the " better angels of our nature " , as he put it on his first day in Downing Street .
The nation needs someone who answers this description to lead it now , just as Labour needs to find someone who is able to set out a case for progressive government .
Political reform can no longer be put aside as an abstract idea , of appeal to dreamers but not to voters who face the harder realities of life .
The public is calling furiously for a better system .
People want an honest parliament .
They want leaders who are prepared to act .
They loathe the old system , and many of the people who are part of it .
Tragedy
The tragedy for Mr Brown and his party is that his chance to change it has gone .
Although he still purports to be a radical , he has adopted the caution of an establishment man .
He cannot lead a revolution against his own way of doing government , and yet a revolution is necessary .
Grandstanding on his claims to good intentions , the prime minister demands the right to carry on , even as the cabinet implodes around him .
The home secretary , the chancellor , and perhaps even the foreign secretary may go , and Labour faces its worst defeat in its history on Thursday , but the prime minister does not recognise his direct responsibility for the mayhem .
The truth is that there is no vision from him , no plan , no argument for the future and no support .
The public see it .
His party sees it .
The cabinet must see it too , although they are not yet bold enough to say so .
The prime minister demands loyalty , but that has become too much to ask of a party , and a country , that was never given the chance to vote for him .
Had there been a contest for the leadership in 2007 - and had Mr Brown called a general election - he would probably have won .
He decided not to do these things .
And he has largely failed since .
Any assessment must recognise the strength of Mr Brown 's response to the financial implosion .
When action to save the banks was needed , he acted impressively .
But flaws in his character that drove his party close to revolt last summer now dominate again .
He is not obviously able to lead .
He blames others for failures and allows them insufficient credit for successes , as the current dismembering of Alistair Darling 's reputation shows .
He is only secure in the economic comfort zone he built up as chancellor , and in the company of his closest allies , such as Ed Balls , now being tipped as chancellor .
The prime minister shines at the IMF or the G20 , but the job involves much more than that .
Great causes win the day when people fight for them .
A year of lingering emptiness beckons instead .
Parliament is treading water ; little is happening beyond the discredited attempt to sell off part of Royal Mail .
Parts of government still function : on climate change , for instance , Britain is leading the way towards Copenhagen .
But Mr Brown himself is not inspiring progress on these things .
The McBride affair was poisonous to his reputation , but he did not seem to understand why .
His timidity in the face of the expenses crisis has been painful .
The blunt reality is that , even if he set out a grand programme of reform now , his association with it would doom its prospects .
Proportional representation would transform parliament , but if Mr Brown put a referendum on the ballot , it would be defeated because he backed it .
A draft constitutional renewal bill was published more than 12 months ago - but what has come of it ?
This week Mr Brown announced a national democratic council that might ( to see it in a generous light ) form the basis of the sort of constitutional convention that led to Scotland 's modern parliament .
But it is too late .
The chance for him has passed .
The next seven days will be crucial to Britain 's political future .
Jacqui Smith 's pre-emptive resignation yesterday was the start of a reshuffle that Mr Brown may be imagining will defend himself from terrible election results .
He is heading for the bunker .
If Labour holds off now , at perhaps the last moment when a change of leader might be possible , it had better reconcile itself to sticking with its leader to the bitter end .
The worst of all worlds would be for people to drag their feet , carry on supporting him when others desert , then desert too , late in the day , when it can only make things worse .
During the next few days it will become apparent whether Mr Brown still commands sufficient support among his parliamentary colleagues to carry on .
If he suspects not , he would win much respect by announcing that he will be standing down , and let his party choose someone who can use its remaining time in power to reform parliament and then fight the election with credibility .
The case for a new leader has been made stronger by the expenses crisis .
Labour needs to enter the next election having reformed parliament .
But Mr Brown will never do it .
The prime minister was absent from the start of the debate and cautious now he has joined it .
His instinct is usually to hesitate , and to establish reviews and commissions .
Meanwhile , the chance of a generation is being missed .
Only a Labour government , working with the Liberal Democrats , will bring about serious reform .
The likelihood , for all David Cameron 's promises , is that the Conservatives will not be radical enough , especially on fair votes .
But Mr Brown has shown himself incapable of collaborating in this way .
His disastrous announcement of expenses reform on YouTube showed that he cannot build the coalitions of interest ( inside his party , never mind beyond ) that are necessary for constitutional change .
If reform is not to stall , someone else will have to lead it .
Rapid contest
The mechanics will not be easy to arrange .
Change will always be a gamble .
Mr Brown , on past form , may fight for his job .
But he cannot last if his cabinet refuses to back him , faced with an inward - looking and isolationist reshuffle that leaves the prime minister at odds with the mood of his own parliamentary party .
Any handover should be rapid and democratic .
There will have to be an election for leader , and clarity from the candidates about when they want to hold a general election .
Labour 's constitution is murky , and some argue that it would be impossible to hold a contest quickly .
They worry that the party might squander much of the time it has left in power in debates and union votes .
They are wrong .
The 2007 contest for deputy leader took less than two months .
Former party officials confirm a contest now could be held in 23 days ; the new prime minister could be in place by early July .
Several ministers would make a better leader than Mr Brown , and want to stand .
They should say so early next week .
After such a contest , parliament could sit longer into the summer and return early in September , as Nick Clegg suggested in the Guardian last week .
A bill should allow a referendum on electoral reform on the date of the next election .
There should be a guarantee that no former MPs and party officials will be sent to the House of Lords .
A bill should be passed to establish fixed terms for parliaments , as works well in Scotland , setting the date for the next election .
The opposition will want one immediately , but a new leader can make the case for some time to establish themselves , for reform laws to pass and for parties to pick new candidates .
They could also argue that David Cameron needs to be tested properly .
An election now would see Britain stumble into the future without any idea where it will lead .
Before polling day , the public also needs to know the score on all MPs - not just that proportion subjected to the Daily Telegraph 's treatment so far .
The most open way to do this would be for every editor , and broadcaster , to be sent the disc now in the hands of one paper , with the onus of meeting data protection and defamation laws on the publishers .
Parties will need time after that to find new candidates .
Progressive future
The needs of the Labour party and the country are obviously not the same .
Labour members must ask themselves this weekend whether they think Mr Brown is best placed to put its values into action , and win popular support for them .
The public , in tomorrow 's elections , will consider whether Mr Brown is the right man to lead the country .
And anyone advocating a change of leadership must make it clear whose interests will gain from it .
This paper believes Britain has often been at its best when Labour has been at its strongest .
People who disagree with that will welcome its implosion , knowing that it will make a Conservative landslide inevitable .
That is why they are not clamouring for Mr Brown to go .
Progressive thinkers do not have this luxury .
Of course many people , who see the better angels in Mr Brown 's nature , do not want his dreams to end like this .
His premiership would be one of the briefest in history .
He would never have fought an election .
But fate can be unjust .
All must agree that the die is cast and a hard judgment made .
Otherwise progressive politics will be dragged down at a general election in May 2010 that could lead to a much bigger defeat than Labour suffered in 1979 .
That might bring a chance for other parties to take it forward , as the Liberal Democrats are trying to do in this election .
But they are not placed to enter government .
Labour has a year left before an election ; its current leader would waste it .
It is time to cut him loose .
Phoenix police arrested a man in Phoenix on Monday on suspicion of raping an unconscious woman live on a popular video hosting Web site .
According to a court document , on Feb. 26 , 2009 , at about 5 a.m. , 20 - year - old Jonathan Hock set up the webcam built into his laptop and broadcast live as he sexually assaulted a woman whom he knew for less than a month as she lay in bed unconscious .
The victim had reportedly been asleep for up to six hours before the assault occurred .
While being interviewed by Phoenix police , the woman said she became aware of the assault after friends text messaged her about the video .
According to a court document , the woman then found pictures on the Web site of Hock lying next to her as she was asleep and naked from the waist down .
Phoenix police issued a search warrant for the Web site 's content to try to obtain the live video of the assault .
In the video , Hock reportedly made comments about him being able to commit the assault without her knowledge while he performed various sexual acts , according to the court document .
After viewing the five minute video , Phoenix police arrested Hock and booked him on charges of sexual assault and surreptitious video taping .
Police say Hock is allegedly very popular on the site for his sexual behavior , and they said information they received through the investigation indicates there may have been similar acts of this type involving this suspect .
Anyone who may have information about this incident is urged to call Silent Witness at 480 - WITNESS .
An Israeli Embassy spokesman , Israel Mey - Ami , said in a telephone interview : '' He was not here in any official business , and he did not contact the embassy .
I do n't know how long he was in this country , but it mus n't have been very long . ''
Mr. Mey - Ami said that he went to Morelia , the Michoacan state capital , on Thursday to pick up Mr. Mir 's body and bring it to Mexico City .
He said it would be returned to Israel .
A spokesman for the state Attorney General 's office , also acknowledging that Mr. Nir was traveling under the name of Pat Weber , said he did not know why he was using as assumed name , and Mr. Mey - Ami said he had no further details .
Mr. Nir arrived in Mexico City on Sunday and traveled to Uruapan , 190 miles west , to stay with friends .
'' It appears he had some possible business involving shipments of products from Latin America to Europe , '' the spokesman said .
Dov Schmorak , the Israeli Ambassador , said on Israeli army radio that Mr. Nir apparently missed a regularly scheduled flight to Mexico City and hired a private plane .
NPT said :
Will , I respect your opinion .
I was about to go into a rebuttal , but I am afraid we will never agree , because we have fundamentally different priorities , views on personal liberty and societal well being .
Also , unlike you , I cannot ignore yesterday , as the patterns and structures I discern from looking at history inform my view of the world I see now ; " yesterday " gives modernity an analytical framework that I cannot ignore .
We also place different weights on the actors in political economies .
History has shown me , at least , that extra - market politics are often at least as critical in making equitable solutions , whether for the individual or the society at large , as purely market economics .
For just a moment , and grossly simplifying , but by way , I hope , of illustrative and useful example , I 'll look at interwar Europe , a period of interest .
The failure of market forces culminating in Weimar Germany , Pre-Franco Spain , Fascist Italy , and the success of political solutions to the labor problem , post - WWI , in the Scandinavian countries , has given me a profound respect for the possible role of things other than purely market driven solutions when looking at problems of political economy .
The Liberal experiment in the fascist countries was a grand failure .
The willingness of socialist parties in the scandinavian polities to align with rural middleholders , abandoning the rural proletariat ( it 's natural class ally ) , meant that fascism did not take hold in Sweden , and like polities .
This was a political solution , extra - market in cause and effect .
Of the two - fascism , or social democracy - I 'd have opted for the latter , obviously .
But that is another subject .
Suffice it to say that I do not think the edification of the individual or society can be so easily reduced down to the formula of the free market .
I must say , however , that the trash can was an allegory .
I was not arguing for a communist solution , and I am sorry this was misinterpreted .
Many from my wife 's family were wiped out by Stalinist policies towards the Baltic peoples and I am aware perhaps more than many what the Soviet system wrought .
Ironically , though , as you bring it up - one of the largest problems facing the new market economies of the former Soviet republics is the incredible environmental crises facing them as they move into EU - enlargement industrial requirements .
Partly , as you point out , inherited from a system that did n't have to answer to its people for industrial excesses , and partly from a " frontier - era " desire for growth , in excess of the desire for clean growth .
But a problem it is , and without something more than a purely " market " solution , the Baltic Sea , among other resources , may become an ecosystem of the past .
And that is my business .
Best .

CARDIFF , Wales , May 22 ( UPI ) --
A blood test and improved communications could help cut the growing number of inappropriate prescriptions of antibiotics , researchers in Wales suggest .
The clinical trial , published in the British Medical Journal , found those physicians in primary care who underwent training in advanced communications skills and those who made use of a blood test prescribed fewer antibiotics for lower respiratory tract infections -- which generally do not respond to antibiotics .

Study leader Christopher Butler of Cardiff University said that as the problem of bacteria resistance to antibiotic treatment grows , researchers from around the world are seeking ways to improve the quality of antibiotic prescribing .
" Conditions like acute bronchitis account for some 80 percent of all lower respiratory tract infections and despite evidence of little or no benefit from antibiotics , the majority of these patients are still prescribed antibiotics , " Butler said in a statement .
" We know that with the many pressures facing doctors , including worry about leaving pneumonia untreated , they often give patients ' the benefit of the doubt ' and prescribe antibiotics . "
The trial randomized 20 general practices in the Netherlands , where 40 primary care physicians managed 431 patients with lower respiratory tract infection .
The study found 54 percent of doctors practicing according to usual care prescribed antibiotics , while 27 percent trained in the advanced communication and 31 percent who used the blood test methods prescribed antibiotics .
Senior doctors today published a report warning that climate change is the biggest threat to global health of the 21st century .
Rising global temperatures would have a catastrophic effect on human health , the doctors said , and patterns of infection would change , with insect - borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever spreading more easily .
Heatwaves such as occurred in Europe in 2003 , which caused up to 70,000 " excess " deaths , will become more common , as will hurricanes , cyclones and storms , causing flooding and injuries .
" We have not just underestimated but completely neglected and ignored this issue , " said Richard Horton , editor of the Lancet , which published the report commissioned from University College London .
" This has not been an issue on the agenda of any professional body in health in the last 10 years in any significant way .
This report is one of the stepping stones in changing that culture within the health sector .
It is the biggest employer in Britain and it should be a leading voice in the debate . "
The lead author of the report , Prof Anthony Costello , a paediatrician who works on maternal and newborn health in the developing world , said his own views had changed .
" I thought there were other priorities 18 months ago , " he said .
Now he believed that mitigating the impact of rising temperatures was urgent .
" Every year we delay , the costs go up .
We are setting up a world for our children and grandchildren that may be extremely turbulent . "
The biggest impact could be in food and water shortages , which in the past have led to war and mass migration .
Prof Hugh Montgomery , of UCL 's institute for human health and performance , who was one of the report 's authors , noted that Mikhael Gorbachev had linked 21 recent conflicts to water instability .
The report says that the poorest people in the world will be worst affected .
Although the carbon footprint of the poorest billion people is about 3 % of the world 's total footprint , loss of life is expected to be 500 times greater in Africa than in the wealthy countries .
Despite improvements in health , 10 million children still die every year , more than 200 million children under five are not developing as well as they should , 800 million people are hungry , and 1,500 million people do not have clean drinking water .
All those things could worsen very significantly , the report says .
The impact of heatwaves , flooding and global food shortages will be felt in Britain too , the authors warned .
" This is an immediate danger .
It is going to affect you and it will certainly affect your children .
While there is the injustice that the poorest will be worst affected , you will be affected too , " said Montgomery .
The report says evidence on greenhouse gas emissions , temperature and sea - level rises , the melting of ice - sheets , ocean acidification and extreme climatic events suggests the forecasts by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007 might be too conservative .
The UK target , to limit global warming to two degrees more , is unlikely to be achieved .
Costello , however , said the message from the report was not entirely negative .
" There is an awful lot we can do , " he said .
Reducing carbon emissions would encourage people to cut use of vehicles , and if that led to more walking and cycling it would tend to lower stress levels , reduce obesity , and lessen heart disease , lung disease and stroke risks .
At the end of March , CBC announced that it had cancelled its half - hour comedy Sophie , one of only a few Canadian programs to prominently feature a gay character — Matt , played by Jeff Geddis .
Matt ’s genesis was from the series ’
French predecessor , Les hautes et les bas de Sophie Paquin , whose openly gay creator wanted to craft a new kind of gay character .
“ I ’ve done a lot of kid ’s shows , like Degrassi but like the French version , ” says series creator Richard Blaimert .
“ I ’ve done a lot of coming out stories and how it ’s so difficult to be gay , so I ’ve done all that for let ’s say 10 years .
When I started to think about Sophie and a gay guy will be her best friend , of course my first thing was that we wo n’t have any problem with the fact that he ’s gay because I ’ve done it so many times and I think that we ’re at a different place right now . ”
The character of Matt was a doctor who was neither a clichéd sexless - best - friend , nor a slutty circuit boy .
Over the two seasons , he had two boyfriends as well as an on - and - off dalliance .
In one episode , Matt was seen at a bathhouse , begging off one of Sophie ’s attempts to get him to babysit for her .
“ I think it ’s important that he ’s alive , ” says Blaimert .
“ We talk about the fact that he has sex . ”
“ I wanted him to be really modern and the kind of guy that I see in my life , who are afraid to commit sometimes or afraid to jump into a relationship , and no big deal about that . ”
With the cancellation of Sophie , it leaves the landscape for queer characters on scripted Canadian television to be fairly bleak .
For the three main broadcast networks in Canada — CBC , CTV and Global — Degrassi ’s Marco , played by Adamo Ruggerio , is the only regular gay character left on the schedule .
Aside from Sophie , CBC ’s Wild Roses also featured a bisexual storyline , but that show was not renewed .
CBC ’s Canada - US - Ireland co-production
The Tudors has featured gay characters in its first two seasons — who virtually all met bad ends — but there are no indications of any gay or lesbian characters in its third season .
The cable side fares only slightly better , with Showcase ( owned by Canwest Global ) being the only channel that is producing any new scripted shows with queer characters .
Currently , they are co-producing a new season of Paradise Falls with here ! , and Exes & Ohs with Logo .
G - Spot , which just completed its third season , is their only strictly Canadian production that features regular queer characters — a gay man and two lesbians .
“ It ’s really odd because we ’re considered to be such an open - minded , tolerant country compared to our neighbour to the south , ” says playwright and television writer Brad Fraser .
“ Certainly in theatre we have n’t had any shortage of gay work , and when you look at film , some of our best films , and some of our best - known filmmakers are gay and make gay films . ”
“ It probably says more about the broadcasters and the people who develop television and their feelings about that kind of thing , ” says Fraser .
“ I ’ve never gone into a situation where I ’ve been developing a television show for Canada , where the powers that be have not tried just on principle just to water it down as much as they can .
It says a lot about how we think TV ’s supposed to be made and what it ’s supposed to do that we do n’t really get a lot of risky TV here in Canada . ”
Fraser also thinks that because Canadian queers do n’t speak up as much about their homegrown programming , it allows the broadcasters to get away without representing them .
“ People are n’t vocal about it here the way they are in America , ” says Fraser .
“ Nobody releases a report every year about how many gay and queer characters there are on television , which network has the most of which shows , and which ones are the biggest stereotypes , and that kind of thing . ”
American lobby group GLAAD ( Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation ) will be releasing their 14th annual “ Where We Are On TV ” report this fall .
“ Viewers can be both entertained and educated by stories on television that reflect the diversity of families and communities across the world , ” says GLAAD President Neil G Giuliano .
“ Images on television and in film have the power to help people embrace their lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender family members , friends and neighbours with understanding and acceptance . ”
GLAAD has also praised the quality of queer representation on Canadian shows that air in the States — such as Degrassi and Sophie .
“ There are some great shows that feature well - written [ queer ] characters produced in Canada that continue to build an audience in the US , ” says Giuliano .
But market realities also have a great deal to do with what gets produced in Canada .
“ There ’s about a hundred times more TV being produced in America , so you get to try a whole bunch of different things to try to grab people , ” says Fraser .
“ Here , if you get two or three shows developed in a year , you ’re really lucky . ”
OutTV , Canada ’s gay and lesbian specialty television channel , is not currently producing any scripted shows in large part because of cost .
“ We found it very challenging to find a way to put together what we really want to do , which is a male - orientated soap opera , ” says Brad Danks , OutTV ’s chief operating officer .
“ We ’ve got a couple of projects in development right now along that way , but they ’re not far enough along . ”
“ It ’s a really tough thing to do , because we ’ve done a lot of scripted drama before , and it ’s a quantum leap in budgets .
Our entire budget for the year — all acquisitions , all productions and otherwise — would be used up if we did one series like that . ”

If it was someone I cared about I would be offended to find a business card in their corpse 's clothing and I would never call that person or do business with them .
At a funeral you should be mourning and paying your last respects , not seeking business opportuntiies .
If you really must be an opportunist in what is a sad event for most people there , it would be more tasteful to leave the card at the entrance .
I doubt that people are worrying about looking for people to do business with when they are at the funeral anyway , so chances are you would n't get many callbacks even if it's a fantastic card ...
The latest viral video comes from the TV show Britain ’s Got Talent and it features Susan Boyle singing “ I Dreamed a Dream ” from Les Misérables .
Part of what makes it sociologically interesting is the response by the judges and audience .
When she first appears , clearly they do n’t expect much , but when she starts to belt it out , the shock on their faces is obvious and the applause is immediate .
Why should they be so surprised ?
She does n’t look the part :
( I see that YouTube is not allowing this video to be embedded .
Just click on the the video above twice and it will take you to YouTube where you can still view it . )
An article from the Vancouver Sun , “ Susan Boyle : Unemployed 47 - year - old virgin becomes overnight music superstar , ” describes her this way :
When 47 - year - old small town spinster Susan Boyle stepped on to the stage of Britain ’s Got Talent and announced she was unemployed , had never been married and “ never been kissed , actually , ” few in the audience would have wondered why .
With unkempt hair and Leonid Breshnev eyebrows , and mention of her ten - year - old cat “ Pebbles , ” the Blackburn , Scotland lass resembled basically every other reality TV talent show timewaster who talks big and delivers nothing but personal humiliation on a national stage .
Another article about the performance from The Herald , titled “ The beauty that matters is always on the inside , ” describes the initial response this way :
The moment the reality show ’s audience and judging panel saw the small , shy , middle - aged woman , they started to smirk .
When she said she wanted a professional singing career to equal that of Elaine Paige , the camera showed audience members rolling their eyes in disbelief .
They scoffed when she told Simon Cowell , one of the judges , how she ’d reached her forties without managing to develop a singing career because she had n’t had the opportunity .
Another judge , Piers Morgan , later wrote on his blog that , just before she launched into I Dreamed a Dream , the 3000 - strong audience in Glasgow was laughing and the three judges were suppressing chuckles .
The article goes on to ask why people responded this way , and her defiance of age and looks expectations are clear culprits :
The answer is that only the pretty are expected to achieve .
Not only do you have to be physically appealing to deserve fame ; it seems you now have to be good - looking to merit everyday common respect .
If , like Susan ( and like millions more ) , you are plump , middle - aged and too poor or too unworldly to follow fashion or have a good hairdresser , you are a non-person .
I think this video would make for interesting discussion regarding how our expectations regarding beauty and youth shape our judgments of others .
Do we give people who are “ young and beautiful ” the benefit of the doubt ?
We say that beauty is only skin deep , but do we sometimes take it as an indicator for other talents ?
Might that result in lost opportunity for those who do not or cannot comply with such normative expectations ?
How might this be different for women versus men ?
And would the response to her performance be different had she been young and beautiful ?
Are people in essence giving her more credit because of her age and appearance as if to say , “ Wow , look at what that old and average looking woman can do , who would have thought it possible ” ?
From the Center for Libertarian Press Information , a release concerning the Afghanistan occupation .
As President Barack Obama struggles to come up with a new strategy for the undeclared war in Afghanistan , Libertarians urge the White House to adopt the only plan that will actually work :
Get out .
“ The occupation of Afghanistan became a failure the instant the goal changed from liquidating al Qaeda to pursuing meddlesome ‘ nation - building ’ objectives , ” says retired Air Force lieutenant colonel Karen Kwiatkowski , who served as a Pentagon analyst during the early days of the occupation and holds a Ph.D. in World Politics from Catholic University .
“ In its eighth year , the US occupation has not only failed to create a stable , democratic Afghanistan , it threatens to deliver nuclear Pakistan into the arms of the very enemy we went there to destroy . ”
On Monday , Obama removed General David McKiernan as commander of US troops in Afghanistan .
Obama also rejected the demand of Afghan President Hamid Karzai for an end to US airstrikes , which have led to hundreds of recent civilian casualties .
Current plans call for an increase in the US troop presence from about 45,000 to 68,000 by the end of 2009 .
The Libertarian Party ’s platform calls for the US to “ abandon its attempts to act as policeman for the world and avoid entangling alliances . ”
Libertarians , it says , “ would end the current U.S. government policy of foreign intervention , including military and economic aid . ”
“ The Afghanistan occupation costs the American taxpayer $ 2 billion a month , ” says R. Lee Wrights of North Carolina , a member of the Libertarian National Committee .
“ That cost is rising , and the price in American and Afghan lives is unbearable .
I abhor the idea of forcing my countrymen to pay in money and blood for a war which makes America less safe and the world less stable .
It ’s long past time to bring the troops home . ”

Tom was on the British team at the Beijing Olympics Teenage Olympic diver Tom Daley said he has not been to school since before Easter because he was being bullied .
Tom , 14 , from Plymouth , was on the British team at the Beijing games and earlier this week won silver at the World Series in Sheffield .
He said the bullying was not " high - level " but " everyone in the school " was doing it .
His school , Eggbuckland Community College in Plymouth , said its policy was to deal firmly with bullying .
After the Olympics it went mad ... everyone that you walk past has a little dig at you
Tom Daley
Tom said : " It 's not getting to me , as in the words are upsetting me , it 's just the fact that I can't have a normal school life like everybody else .
" It 's not high - level bullying , just name calling , someone chucking a bit of paper at you , tipping your pencil case out .
" After the Olympics it went mad ... everyone that you walk past has a little dig at you . "
He said he had not been back to school since before the Easter holidays and had considered changing schools .

" When I was annoyed at school I started to get annoyed at diving .
" I 'm much happier now I can concentrate on diving . "
His father , Rob , said : " It has got to the point where he does n't want to go back to school .
" I 'll have to pull him out of school and switch to another if it continues .
" He should be a positive role model instead of enduring what he 's had to . "
Katrina Borowski , principal of Eggbuckland Community College , said : " Tom 's extremely high profile has led to a minority of students acting in an immature way towards him .
" All involved in his education are supporting him as best we can and immediate action was taken to address concerns raised . "

It 's a crazy new hipster character fond of criminal and sexual hijinks !
Let 's meet Kari Ferrell , the 22 year - old tattooed Utah girl who scammed her way through hipster Brooklyn .
Sex , lies , cancer , and bands , yea !
Kari's story first came out when she lied her way into a job at Vice .
That lasted a week , until someone there Googled her and found out she was wanted back in Utah for fraud , theft , and $ 60 K in bad checks , and was generally a con artist .
But today former Gawkerer Doree Shafrir comes out with a monstrous piece in the Observer on Kari 's whole freaking life story ( Doree is most comfortable when dealing with the criminal element ) .
Oh it is delightful , assuming you were n't personally unfortunate enough to come in contact with the brash young pathological liar / vixen !
The short version : Kari stole and scammed her way around Salt Lake City for a while , then decamped to Brooklyn , where she resumed stealing and scamming , using aggressive sex appeal and wild lies like " I have cancer " or " I'm pregnant " or " I work there " ( sometimes all at once , to her boyfriends ! ) to get ... money ?
Validation ?
She 's obviously mad psycho .
It was also around November that a guy named Troy was at Union Pool , the Williamsburg bar , when the bartender passed him a note from another customer .
It read , " I want to give you a hand job with my mouth , " and was signed " Korean Abdul - Jabbar . "
It was , according to Troy , from Ms. Ferrell .
Another time , a patron at Fabiane 's , the café on Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg , said Ms. Ferrell passed him a note which read : " I want you to throw a hot dog down my hall . "
Now there 's nothing wrong with that in the context of a loving , honest , one night stand , but this girl was just trying to manipulate people .
Virtually everyone says that she told them she had terminal cancer with only months to live , and she was constantly in the hospital [ Kari in the hospital with " Cancer " pic via Flickr ] .
Maybe she just liked hospitals , and the other crazy people there !
Doree even tracked down Ferrell 's first teenage boyfriend back in Utah .
She was crazy then too , sending herself threatening text messages and being this guy 's sugar daddy , with money she stole .
Mr. Hansen went to Los Angeles with his band ; Ms. Ferrell and some of her friends tagged along .
She accused a guy of hitting on her and Mr. Hansen knocked his teeth out .
That was probably a mistake , in retrospect !
Anyhow Kari Ferrell is still at large and on the run , so if you know her whereabouts , or just have some crazy stories about her , do not approach her directly ; just email us at once , and we 'll all have a good laugh .
Oh , look we have one already , from our very own Richard Lawson :
Over the past few months the term ' One Law For All ' has arisen in news stature .
The label given by the proponents is unfortunate as it is not intentionally deceptive , but the effective result is very deceptive , in the best tradition of ' best intentions ' .
Although I do sympathize with their sentiment , their choices of words and objectives deserve examination in the harsh light of what it is they are actually trying to achieve .
Who is driving ' One Law for All ' [ 01 ] ?
Maryam Namazie [ 02 ] seems to be at the center of this political storm as outlined on their site .
Ms Namazie is apparently very well informed and demonstrates a very real concern for the people she and the others in the movement are professing to speak out for .
Her sentiment and her efforts clearly merit consideration if not outright admiration .
And let it be known from the outset that this article is not in any way meant to disparage or otherwise discourage her efforts , but rather to examine some aspects which might best be revised before darker interests usurp her efforts .
What are the basic objectives of ' One Law for All ' ?
The intent is nominally outlined as a
“ … call on the UK government to bring an end to the use and institutionalisation of Sharia and all religious laws and to guarantee equal citizenship rights for all . ”
Less noted is a somewhat more difficult declaration left to later in the leaflet which outlines their principles and intents as a declaration :
“ We demand that the Arbitration Act 1996 be amended so that all religious tribunals are banned from operating within and outside of the legal system . ”
It seems ok on first reading – what are the issues with all this ?
1 .
In the bit about asking a government to ' guarantee equal citizenship rights for all ' the proponents of ' One Law for All ' are asking the government to expand its enforcement activities to intervene in the religious affairs of its citizens .
If you like government , you will simply adore what government does to people in the name of ' equal citizenship rights for all ' .
That religion is a personal choice is something many take for granted in this day and age , but the reality is that most people are born into a religion rather than converted .
This means that religious authority is often regarded as being above and beyond the nominal government by virtue of its power over family and kin .
When religious authorities take it upon themselves to enforce bestial legal principles upon their congregations , constituents can find their faith at odds with their own existence .
When they accede to the requirements of religion they are , in essence , yielding their last shreds of sovereignty to their religious manipulators .
The government stands aside in such cases since interfering with what is legally presumed to be individual choice quickly becomes religious persecution .
It is this inactivity which ' One Law for All ' proponents wish to end – they want the government to actively pre-empt any religious decrees from being enforced by the very people who accept these beliefs .
Charles Darwin would probably have a clue – let those who wish to submit themselves to the primitive forms of violence and subjugation espoused by their revered mind - benders go right ahead and do whatever they wish as long as they abide in public by whatever the government rules .
If they end up shortchanged then they will have harvested what they have planted .
Personal choice entails personal responsibility and those who submit their own selves to superstitious nonsense deserve their own fates whatever they may be .
Those with strong enough personalities to escape the clutches of such inanity have in a Darwinian fashion earned the right to survive .
In closing this point it is noted that it would be an improvement for this movement if they simply pushed for the government to enforce its existing laws appropriately rather than permitting injustices to be performed as an abettor to whatever crimes are being perpetrated .
2 .
Banning “ all religious tribunals ” is yet another step in a bad direction .
The semantics of banning any form of a religious activity opens a whole Pandora 's Box of loopholes to be exploited at the whim of political powers .
The problem with banning anything is in the matter of interpretation , and everyone know ( woops ! ) that laws are always interpreted in favor of whoever holds the most political clout .
What might be more palatable is making sure any such tribunal has no real power but is limited to an advisory capacity alone .
3 .
In this universe there is but The One Law :
No Being shall Harm another Being .
If the people behind ' One Law for All ' were truly serious about equal treatment they would acknowledge that in truth there is but The One Law and that all the other machinations of supertitious aborigines and control - freak governments are merely games played to fleece constituents .

' One Law for All '
It is noted that although the site uses the label One Law for All , the full labelling is given as “ One Law for All – Campaign against Sharia law in Britain ” .
This hints of a mild deception that they are actually more focused upon opposing Sharia than being secular as some might wish to believe .
In effect , they are usurping the power of the term
One law in what will eventually be yet another Matrix of many additional legal snares .
[ 02 ]
http://maryamnamazie.blogspot.com/
' Maryam Namazie '
Google her – she has many more aspects than just this one , too many and too controversial to discuss here .
Ultimately , she is not under discussion here – she is the spokesperson and as ' campaign organiser ' [ see http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO0812/S00020.htm] is simply a personification of what is ultimately a large and diverse group of people participating in the movement .

If FOX News does anything well , it ’s obvious bias .
A recent article , titled , “ Muslim Women in U.S. Struggle to Balance Western Freedoms and Islamic Culture ” makes no attempts to hide the opinion of the writer and the message she wants to convey to her readers .
Each line is so riddled with assumptions and misconceptions , I do n’t know where to begin .
The whole piece makes me cringe .
Let ’s begin with the title .
“ Muslim women in U.S. ” makes it sound like all Muslim women come from elsewhere .
How about “ American Muslim women ” ?
But that would n’t fit with the message writer Ruth Ravve is sending :
There ’s a strict divide between Americanness ( what with its “ Western freedoms ” ) and Muslimness ( what with its “ Islamic culture ” ) .
Note the contrast : freedom vs. culture .
And then there ’s “ struggle . ”
The headline decisively concludes that this clash between the vague Western freedoms and the monolithic Islamic culture is something Muslim women struggle with .
Let ’s move on to the first sentence :
The “ call to prayer ” is a sound heard five times a day in this city , but this is not the Middle East .
It ’s Dearborn , Michigan — which has the largest Arab - American population in the U.S .
Ravve effectively sets the scene .
Message : There ’s an impending Muslim takeover .
Large Arab population .
That frightening call to prayer — in scare quotes , too — the same one that documentaries play behind behind about the Taliban or Al - Qaida .
It all sounds like the Middle East .
But no !
This is America .
Which , Ravve presumes , makes the notable Arab and Muslim presence a problem .
In the fourth paragraph , Ravve writes ,
But while there are plenty of comforts from their home countries , Muslim women say they ’re constantly caught balancing their lives between the freedoms they have in Western culture and the restrictions they face from religious and societal pressure .
They worry about whether they ’re following the habits of “ a good Muslim woman . ”
Message 1 : America = good .
Muslims = bad .
Notice the quotations attributed to generalized groups like “ Muslim women , ” not specific individuals .
Message 2 : There exists a clear , undisputed idea of what makes a “ good Muslim woman , ” recognized by Muslims around the world — because every culture that involves Islam has the exact same values , ideals , and interpretation of Islam .
Immediately upon introducing her first specific source , Ravve describes her clothing : “ a traditional two - piece suit and a Muslim headscarf , called a hijab .
The scarf covers her hair and tightly frames her face .
She says the hijab was designed as a way to honor women in Islam , by concealing their beauty . ”
Message :
The hijab is tight and restricting .
It serves to conceal beauty .
This is what Islam does : restrict and conceal .
But the oh - so - tired discussion of hijab is not the only overused tactic Ravve employs .
She also makes references to the most extreme examples of treatment of women in Muslim countries .
She writes ,
Many of the immigrant women come to the United States from Muslim countries where they have few rights .
Women are not allowed to drive cars or keep their own passports in Saudi Arabia , for example .
It is very difficult for a woman to go to school or even leave her home without a male relative escorting her in parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan .
If Ravve wants to draw a contrast between the United States and a “ Muslim country , ” Saudi Arabia is the perfect example to point to — its restrictions on women are so extreme they ’re not paralleled by any other country .
This , however , makes it not terribly reflective of the entire Muslim world .
What percentage of women in Dearborn are actually from Saudi Arabia ?
Not the majority , I ’d assume — especially if they ca n’t get passports .
According to the U.S. Census ( 2000 , ) the major nationalities among Arab - Americans are Iraqi , Lebanese , Egyptian , Palestinian , Syrian , and Yemeni .
Ravve ’s second example is also extreme .
These “ parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan ” are presumably those under Taliban influence , which is not the experience of most of the immigrant women Ravve is discussing .
Notice that none of her sources say , “ When I lived in Afghanistan … ” or “ When I was in Saudi Arabia … ” , much less follow it up with “ I could n’t leave the house ” or “ I could n’t legally drive . ”
The reference to Saudi Arabia and parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan does not actually relate to Ravve ’s story , but it does convey a message .
Message :
The most extreme examples of repression of women in Muslim countries are representative of the entire Muslim world .
Specifically , Muslim women can’t drive until they get to America .
Ravve keeps stressing the idea that Islam and U.S. are extremely different from each other .
She writes ,
In fact , life for Muslim women in the U.S. is so different that they say they ’re not sure whether to accept the sudden opportunities they have here , or reject them for fear that it does n’t fit within their religious followings .
Message : Islam and America are different .
This is because the U.S. is full of opportunities , and Islam is very restrictive .
Ravve quotes a woman giving one interpretation of Islam :
“ In our religion it ’s forbidden to listen to music and there ’s some areas that we stay away from … because we do n’t listen to music , ” said Fakhreddine .
Ravve fails to mention that certainly not all Muslims follow this interpretation .
Message : Islam bans music .
( Not “ Some interpretations of Islam ban music . ” )
Ravve consistently presents one interpretation of Islam as what “ Islam says , ” using only one source to back up her claim .
She writes ,
Also under Islam , it ’s acceptable for a man to have up to four wives at a time .
While that ’s illegal in the United States , Islamic leaders say the religion designates the man as the head of the household .
Who are these “ Islamic leaders ” ?
Ravve does not follow this up with a quote from an Islamic leader , so we have to take her on her word .
The quote that follows is from Umia Mustafa , “ who moved here from Pakistan 10 years ago , after her parents arranged her marriage to a Pakistani man already living here . ”
I guess that qualifies her to speak for all Muslims ?
Throughout the article , Ravve attributes claims about Islam to “ Islamic leaders , ” but she never mentions who these leaders are .
Also note the contrast Ravve draws between the illegal status of polygamy in the U.S. and the claim that men are the head of the household .
What ’s the contradiction ?
Monogamy certainly does n’t eliminate patriarchy , but the message here is that in America , the man is never the head of the household , that this idea is reserved to Muslims .
Ravve quotes Mustafa describing the authority of her husband , as though this only happens in Muslim marriages .
Ravve uses an indirect quote from Mustafa to claim that in Islam , “ no matter where it ’s practiced , there ’s no question who is in charge . ”
Message : Muslims do n’t respect women .
Even if they live in America .
You should be worried .
To make the message even clearer , Ravve blatantly warns that “ clashes of culture can have deadly consequence , ” pointing to the murder of Aasiya Hassan , making the wild jump that the horrific incident occurred due to some “ culture clash , ” rather than as a brutal act of domestic violence .
She quotes a woman whose qualification to speak on behalf of all Muslims is that she was born in Yemen :
“ The typical Muslim man , they always are very overprotective , they ’re very controlling over the women .
They ’re not allowed to do this , they ’re not allowed to do that , ” says 23 - year - old Fai Oman , who was born in Yemen .
Message : Being controlling and overprotective is part of being a Muslim man .
And women should watch out — these controlling Muslim men might kill them .
Notice that Ravve does n’t interview a single man in her article — although a quote on the role of women from one of those controlling Muslim husbands she alludes would help her argument .
Perhaps she was afraid of culture clash resulting in “ deadly consequence ” ?
Ravve uses the cliché of an oppressed Muslim woman saved by “ the West ” :
She [ Oman ] says she feels lucky to be living in the West because she has more freedom and security than she would have in her home country .
Taking on Western viewpoints and a less traditional look makes Oman stand out in the typical female Muslim community .
She dresses in jeans and a low - cut sweater .
Her dark hair is highlighted with blonde streaks , and her eyes are colored with bright blue shadow .
Again , Ravve focuses on appearance to make a point about Muslim women .
According to Ravve , jeans , a low - cut sweater , blond streaks , and eyeshadow make Oman “ stand out ” in the “ typical female Muslim community . ”
What is that “ typical ” community ?
Because jeans are ubiquitous , and the other items are n’t rarities either .
But Ravve makes these details of Oman ’s appearance into symbols of her acceptance of American values .
( A concept as vague as “ Western viewpoints ” — whatever those are . )
In painting Oman as a clash against the conservative , misogynist Islam described , Ravve references the nameless “ Islamic leaders ” again to show the threat of Islam :
Some Islamic leaders fear women like Oman will become more common and that Western culture will have too much influence over generations of Muslim women who grow up and live in America .
Ravve quotes another woman , Sakainah Faleh , who is not only a Yemen native but also a “ teacher who tutors young Muslim girls in the proper ways of Islam . ”
It ’s unclear what these “ proper ways of Islam ” are .
From the rest of the article , I expect we ’re supposed to think oppressed , controlled , music - free women .
Faleh ’s quote itself is vague , and it ’s not clear what source Faleh is actually referring to .
She says , “ It does worry me because it ’s improper behavior [ that ] does lead to … harm to the female . ”
Is the “ improper behavior ” Oman ’s hair , clothes , and “ Western viewpoints ” ?
If so , how does Faleh know Oman ?
Some more context would make the quote clearer , but perhaps it would n’t fit in so nicely after the description of Oman .
The story ends on a better note than the beginning , but it ’s still problematic .
Ravve quotes a “ Muslim leader ” ( no actual title ) from CAIR :
But Muslim leaders like Amina Aharif , from the Council on American Islamic relations ( CAIR ) , say that with so many women coming here from multiple Muslim countries , there are already different viewpoints and traditions influencing them .
Each comes to the United States with her own versions of cultural and religious practices , she adds .
“ Just like America is a melting pot for people from all over the world , it is a melting pot for Muslims from all over the world , ” said Aharif .
“ It is such a diverse community . ”
I ’m guessing Aharif meant to challenge Ravve ’s perception of Islam as a monolithic culture .
However , Ravve ’s placement of the quote ends up giving credit to America .
Message : Islam is a threat to women , but American culture will prevail .
Lawrence King was one too many .
But as we know , harassment and violence toward gay youth ( or children branded as “ gay ” by classmates ) are not a series of isolated incidents .
In 2007 , 17 - year - old Eric Mohat killed himself after endless gay - hate taunting .
Now Mohat ’s parents are identifying those who they see responsible : the school ’s administrators and teachers .
And they ’re suing .
But they ’re not in it for the money .
At least , they ’re not asking for any ; the lawsuit they filed late last month does not ask for any compensation , only that Mentor High School in Ohio acknowledge Mohat ’s death as a “ bullicide . ”
( Named in the lawsuit , filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio , are administrators Jacqueline A. Hoynes and Joseph Spiccia , and math teacher Thomas M. Horvath . )
Why so significant ?
Because Mohat was n’t the only one .
Three other students in Mohat ’s class killed themselves in 2007 .
The three kids , two boys and a girl , were described as “ extremely bright , ” but they were branded “ nerds ” by classmates , and viciously harassed before they took their own lives .
( Another male student wrote a suicide note two weeks after Mohat ’s death ; he did not kill himself . )
Reports ABCNews.com :
Eric Mohat — whose friends knew him as “ Twiggy ” for his lean , 6 - foot - 1 - inch , 112 - pound physique — had a dry wit and musical talent , according to his mother , Jan Mohat .
He had played piano for 13 years , enjoyed video games , anime , Harry Potter books and “ cracking puzzles . ”
“ By all indications he was a very nice , typical high school kid , kind of quiet and shy , but outgoing with his little group of friends , ” said the family ’s lawyer Ken Myers .
“ He seemed to have a quirky sense of humor and was also very sensitive . ”
The bullying “ accumulated over time , ” Myers told ABCNews.com .
“ In math class , two or three picked on him constantly and mercilessly .
Most of it was verbal , but they did some things like sitting behind him and flicking him in the ear , sticking stuff in his hoodie and putting eraser shavings on his head .
Out of class they would shove him in lockers . ”
Much of the taunting was related to him being considered gay , though Eric Mohat ’s parents said the teen “ did n’t identify himself that way , ” Myers said .
“ He may have looked effeminate , was in theater and would wear bright clothes , ” said Myers .
“ He was a skinny kid , and so the kids found something that bothered him and went for that . ”
The parents say Eric Mohat routinely ignored the teasing but complained to the teacher , who responded by moving the bullies ’ desks .
“ The next day , they were back and it made it worse , ” said Myers .
“ They may have thought he was a snitch and the parents did n’t know how bad it was . ”
But March 29 , 2007 , one bully pushed Eric Mohat too far with a remark about killing himself , the lawsuit alleges .
The teen took a legally registered gun from his father ’s bureau drawer , locked himself in his room and shot himself in the head .
At the time , Eric Mohat ’s older sister , Erin , was on a treadmill exercising .
His after - school employer called their home to find out why he had not shown up at work .
Erin Mohat found her brother ’s body in his bedroom and called 911 .
Now 21 , his sister is studying to be a school psychologist , something Jan Mohat said is now “ a calling . ”
“ My sister is my hero , ” Eric Mohat had written on his MySpace page , though she was too late to save him .
Later authorities found a story Eric Mohat had begun to write about bullying .
Days before , he had told his mother about the nonstop taunts in both class and in the hallways of the high school .
The family said school officials had been resistant to cooperate in the investigation and had insisted bullying was not a problem ; the bullies never showed remorse .
“ This is the first we heard that a suit was filed , ” said Justin Maynor , communications director for the Mentor Public School District .
“ We had a hunch it was coming . ”
Meanwhile , Mentor Public School District communications director Justin Maynor has the audacity to say , “ Generally , there is a very low incidence of violence at the school .
Considering its population , it ’s a relatively serene place . ”
And the “ several ” student suicides in the “ last couple of years ” ?
Maynor insists they have no connection to bullying .
“ We do n’t believe it ’s a problem . ”
LAREDO , Texas —
For evidence of the booming bullet business along the U.S. - Mexico border , look no further than the case of Carlos Alberto Osorio Castrejon and Ramon Uresti Careaga .
The two Mexican men crossed the Rio Grande on a three - day shopping visa on Nov. 1 , 2006 .
Their destination : Kirkpatrick Guns and Ammo in a tony shopping district of this Texas border city .
They were sitting on the store floor sorting their purchase of 12,570 live rounds of assorted ammunition when their luck ran out .
In walked an off - duty special agent for the ATF ( the agency regulating sales of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms ) , who , after ascertaining that the men were n't U.S. citizens , arrested them on the spot .
Castrejon and Careaga would go on to confess that they 'd made numerous other day trips to buy U.S. ammunition to bring back to Mexico — just the month before , they 'd shelled out $ 6,193 in cash for bullets at another local store .
As this case and others show , Mexican smugglers are simply dropping over the border on three - day shopping visas , toting wads of cash , and bringing warring Mexican drug cartels huge quantities of bullets .
By all accounts , the bullet trade is booming in this region , especially in Texas .
Not coincidentally , the trade 's boom is taking place as a savage drug war rages below the border in Mexico .
In just the last year , Mexico 's civil drug war has claimed 6,300 lives .
There are some laws that govern the purchase of new guns from retailers and licensed dealers , although they do n't stop smugglers from arming cartels with these guns .
But bullets are a commodity almost as unregulated as milk or bread , with no record - keeping requirements , no limits on the number of bullets an individual can purchase , and no way to disqualify potential buyers based on criminal history .
And unlike guns , bullets do n’t have serial numbers that can later be traced to a store or person .
The one law that applies to ammunition purchases does n’t do much to hinder Mexican bullet - buyers :
It simply mandates that buyers be U.S. citizens , but it does n't require retailers to check .
So it ’s do n’t ask , do n’t tell .
And only by poor luck do Mexican smugglers coming into U.S. border towns on shopping visas get caught in the act of smuggling .
Storeowner Bill Kirkpatrick — the owner of Kirkpatrick Guns and Ammo , where the ATF agent practically stumbled over the two Mexican smugglers — said he does n’t ask for proof of citizenship from ammunition buyers because nothing in the law says he has to .
“ On ammo , we do n’t ask , because a lot of people can get offended , ” Kirkpatrick explained .
“ It ’s politically incorrect , like you ’re calling them a spic . ”
Mexican and U.S. authorities peg U.S. retailers as the source of more than 3 million rounds of ammunition seized in Mexico over just the past 24 months , which is considered a small percentage of an unknown total .
While authorities in both countries have tried to curtail the smuggling of U.S. firearms to Mexico for some time , they 've only recently turned their attention to American ammunition .
“ If they do n’t have bullets they ca n’t use the guns , ” said J. Dewey Webb , the Houston - based leader of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives .
“ It ’s just as important and it ’s just as illegal .
If we could reduce the traffickers to throwing rocks at each other , I think we ’ve achieved our goal . ”
There can be no doubt that American retailers are profiting handsomely from Mexico ’s drug war .
Authorities believe one of the nation ’s busiest ammunition - smuggling corridors runs through South Texas because of a proliferation of stores in densely populated regions close to the Mexican border .
That pipeline , they say , runs south through McAllen , Harlingen and Brownsville .
The connecting Mexican state of Tamaulipas is listed as one of the top five Mexican states for illegal ammunition seizures , according to Mexico ’s attorney general ’s office .
The market for certain kinds of ammo is so robust that big chains and smaller independent stores all along the Texas border report being unable to keep up with demand for .50 caliber sniper rifle rounds , which can sell for $ 4 each , and 5.7 “ cop killer ” bullets that can penetrate police body armor .
Employees of Texas - based retailer Academy Sports and Outdoors have plenty of stories about men piling shopping carts high with the $ 74 - cases of 7.62 caliber rounds that only fit AK - 47 assault rifles , as well as clearing shelves of .9 mm rounds and other ammunition that fit other kinds of assault - style rifles popular with cartel gunmen .
“ I had a guy come in the other day and clear me out of .223s , ” Francisco Rodriguez , who works in the guns and ammunition section of a store in McAllen , Texas , said , referring to ammunition that fits many kinds of assault - type rifles , as well as regular hunting rifles .
But unlike a typical hunter , he said , this customer “ paid $ 5,000 cash , and then he went to one of our other stores and cleaned that out , too .
I did n’t ask what he was going to do with it .
He probably was going to take it to Mexico . ”
Mountains of ammunition types so popular at Academy stores in Texas keep turning up across the Rio Grande in drug cartel weapons depots .
One bust of a cartel weapons stash house in Reynosa , Mexico last October netted half a million assorted rounds .
South Texas retailers do n’t like to contemplate the prospect that they might be profiting from Mexico ’s tragedy .
Instead , many of those interviewed prefer to believe that target - shooting hobbyists are the ones primarily buying out their stocks .
Austin Ortiz , manager of the firearms section in a newly opened Academy Sports and Outdoors store in McAllen , Texas , offered a typical anecdote .
He said the 7.62 and .223 calibers that fit AK - 47s and Colt AR - 15 military assault - style rifles are among his best - sellers .
Often , customers pay in cash .
“ There are a lot of gun ranges around here , ” Ortiz tried to explain , at first .
Asked if he thought smugglers were also buying , he offered this : “ I ’m pretty sure there are people out there who will take it over and sell it at a profit . ”
Yet there ’s no store policy or law requiring Ortiz to record or limit sales to anyone .
Academy declined to respond to a GlobalPost request for an interview .
Because of the absence of mandatory or voluntary controls on ammo sales , agents hunting the trail of smuggling - minded shoppers will remain hard - pressed to cut this supply line .
Whereas guns recovered in Mexico can at least be traced to a store and original buyer , bullets leave no trail .
Smugglers eliminate all clues by removing the rounds from coded store boxes .
Bullets are considered too heavy to carry into Mexico by hiking or swimming , so shells usually go into secret vehicle compartments , and then are driven south .
In Texas , the U.S. Customs and Border Protection fields several inspections teams that troll southbound vehicles for cash , guns and — of late — ammunition .
But there are n't enough of them to present much of a deterrent , agency officials admit .
“ The reality is that the smuggler has the advantage over us , ” conceded the Laredo - based CBP assistant port director , Jose R. Uribe .
“ It ’s just the nature of the border . ”
It 's unlikely that gun sales will become more regulated in the U.S. anytime soon .
But regulation of commodities that carry social costs is n't without precedent .
In the early 2000s , Texas and other states with methamphetamine drug problems passed laws restricting the volume sales of over - the - counter cold medicines used to make the drug .
In October , President Bush signed the Methamphetamine Production Prevention Act , requiring retailers like Walgreens and Target to log sales of cold medicines as a means to help law enforcement officers and deter meth producers .
“ I do see a parallel , ” said East Texas - based Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin McClendon , who in 2004 filed a civil lawsuit against Walgreens seeking to force compliance with sales reporting rules .
“ If the abuse of the sales offends the public enough , I could see restrictions going that way with ammunition sales too . ”

Heartbeat key for blood growth in embryos
For blood cells to grow in an embryo , they need the pressure of a beating heart , say US researchers .
The finding explains why an embryo's heart starts beating just weeks after conception , and it points the way to new stem cell - based treatments for a host of blood disorders such as leukaemia .
" In learning how the heartbeat stimulates formation of embryos , we 've taken a leap forward in understanding how to direct blood formation from embryonic stem cells in the petri dish , " says Dr George Daley of Harvard Medical School and Children 's Hospital Boston , whose study appears in the journal Nature .
" These observations reveal an unexpected role for biomechanical forces in embryonic development , " says Guillermo Garcia - Cardena of Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston , who also worked on the study .
Stem cells are the body 's master cells , providing a renewable source of brain , bone , muscle , blood and other cells .
An embryo in the first days after conception is made up entirely of these cells , each of which can give rise to all of the cells and tissues in the body .
Daley 's team looked at how the stress of friction and the flow of fluid affected the formation of blood cells from mouse embryonic stem cells .
Promoting blood
The study showed that these forces promote blood formation and increase the production of colonies of cells that give rise to specific types of blood cells .
Mouse embryos with a mutation that kept the developing heart from beating had far fewer of these so - called progenitor blood cell colonies .
In a separate study , a team led by Dr Leonard Zon of Harvard and Children 's Hospital Boston , looked at the effects of the embryonic heartbeat in zebrafish , which have transparent embryos .
" We were looking in real aortas in real vertebrate embryos to see the actual stem cells , " says Zon .
The study published in journal Cell found that levels of nitric oxide , which is known to play a key role in blood vessel formation , increase when blood is flowing .
Mutant embryos that had no heart beat or circulation were found to have far lower levels of blood - forming stem cells known as hematopoietic progenitor cells .
Researchers think nitric oxide may work as a type of signal to start the process of blood stem cell production .
" This finding connects the change in blood flow with the production of new blood cells , " says Zon .
The findings may lead to new ways to coax iPS cells - which look and act like embryonic stem cells - into producing blood - forming cells that could be used by people with leukaemia who need bone marrow transplants , he says .

The IDF Southern Command 's military court remanded the arrest of a Givati Brigade soldier Wednesday for looting during Israel 's recent military operation in Gaza .
The soldier is suspected of stealing a credit card from a Palestinian home together with another soldier .
He later proceeded to use it in order to purchase merchandise worth NIS 1,600 ( $ 388 ) .
Their arrest was first reported by Ynet .
The accused soldier pled guilty to the charges against him during questioning , and the military prosecution intends to indict him in the coming days .
His arrest is currently remanded until Monday .
The Palestinian first complained of his missing credit card on April 14 , three months after the Gaza operation ended .
The complaint said the card had disappeared from a home in the northern Gaza Strip , and that its owner noticed some time later that he had been billed for purchases made in Israel .
The complaint triggered a covert investigation by the military police , and a secret report was handed to the judge just before the two soldiers were arrested .
The officer heading the investigation said it was still underway , and may involve other soldiers and civilians .

That 's what a paper at the Brooking Institution suggests .
Derek Thompson summarizes :
The grand retelling goes something like this .
Cheap gasoline from the 1990s into this decade encouraged families to set up their homes farther from the cities where they worked .
But as the price of gas began to increase , it put a big strain of these families ' commutes .
With gas rising from $ 2 to $ 4 , the price of these long drives doubled , straining those families ' most expensive payments , namely : mortgages .
When families realized they could not afford their exurban commutes , they sold their homes for a big loss .
Voila :
Their mortgage crisis became a bank crisis and the rest is our living history .
Thompson gauges the political implications :
My head 's still spinning a bit , but it 's interesting to think about the political consequences of a report like this being mainstreamed .
If the idea somehow stuck that an oil shock was responsible for the financial crisis , it could be a significant catalyzer for the push toward energy reform .
Today we 're seeing a great national movement to change Wall Street because the general consensus is that Wall Street caused this crisis .
Whether Hamilton 's theory is wacko or brilliant , just imagine what a national movement to revolutionize America 's energy consumption would look like .
What if we had oil parties instead of tea parties , demanding more government investment in alternative fuels and subsidies for green technologies .
That would really be something .

THIS is the end of the line for Encarta , the encyclopedia that Microsoft introduced in 1993 and still describes boastfully on its Web site as “ the No. 1 best - selling encyclopedia software brand for the past eight years . ”
Microsoft recently announced that sales would soon cease and that the Encarta Web site , supported by advertising , would be shut down later this year .
It ’s hard to look at the end of the Encarta experiment without the free and much larger Wikipedia springing immediately to mind .
But Encarta arguably would have failed even without that competition .
The Google - indexed Web forms a virtual encyclopedia that Encarta never had a chance of competing against .
Encarta was conceived pre-Web and had a long gestation .
In 1985 , Bill Gates envisioned a CD - ROM encyclopedia as a “ high - price , high - demand ” product with the potential of becoming as profitable to Microsoft as Word or Excel .
Microsoft tried unsuccessfully to license rights to Encyclopedia Britannica ’s text , then World Book’s .
It finally found a willing licensor in Funk & Wagnalls .
Microsoft ’s Encarta team concentrated on developing nontext supplements that would make it a multimedia extravaganza .
The team developed illustrations and maps , a timeline and an atlas , assembled and wrote captions for 11,000 photographs and digitized eight hours of sound clips .

BBC News , Islamabad
The Taliban have proved themselves to be formidable adversaries Pakistan 's security forces appear to have achieved their main objective in Swat with the capture of its administrative seat of Mingora .
That region and the rest of the Malakand division now seem to be under the control of the Pakistan army .
Some fighting is still going on in the mountainous rural areas - especially the Peochar valley , the militants ' main stronghold .
Everyone on the list of most wanted militants - from Osama Bin Laden onwards - is said to be hiding in that area .
Dissent and duplicity
Swat 's turn in the limelight may be entering its final phase , in fact some senior government officials believe it is already over .
The army now seems to be preparing itself for a new front as clashes erupt across the tribal region of Waziristan .
Baitullah Mehsud , supreme leader of the militant alliance Tehrik - e - Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) , now awaits them .
Baitullah Mehsud profile
As a prelude to that operation , Pakistan 's intelligence agencies have been whittling away at his influence .
Increasingly he is faced with dissent and duplicity in his South Waziristan base .
A rival clan led by powerful pro-government leader , Turkistan Bittani , has been making in - roads at his expense .
He is aided by Qari Zainuddin Mehsud , leader of the Abdullah Mehsud group in Waziristan .
Until his death , Abdullah Mehsud was , along with Baitullah , the main Taliban commander among the Mehsud tribe .
Some argue he had an even higher profile and stronger relationship with al - Qaeda than his namesake and that he posed a greater threat .
Abdullah Mehsud was killed in Baluchistan 's Zhob district in July 2007 following a fire fight with security forces .
Greater authority Later , reports surfaced that information about his whereabouts had been leaked on Baitullah 's orders .
The army says that the Taliban are losing territory
The two men were known to have developed serious differences - especially concerning Baitullah 's focus on Pakistan .
Now Abdullah 's cousin , Qari Zain , has clearly said the TTP head 's activities are un-Islamic and that he must be removed .
In addition , Baitullah Mehsud 's ersthwhile allies , Maulvi Nazir and Hafiz Gul Bahadur , appear intent on sitting the latest fighting out on the sidelines .
They are the only two Pakistan Taliban commanders of similar if not greater authority and could have been powerful allies .
So Baitullah Mehsud now appears not only surrounded by the army but also running out of allies .
See a map of the region
The question then is what will happen to the Taliban in Pakistan if he is no longer in charge ?
Many people believe the TTP may fracture and the organisation could end up being destroyed .
But there are other militant leaders such as Zulfiqar Mehsud - also known as Hakimullah Mehsud - waiting in the wings .
Zulfiqar Mehsud last week told the BBC that two separate attacks in Lahore which killed 10 people were carried out by the Taliban in response to the army 's operation in the Swat valley .
He is also thought to be behind recent attacks on supply convoys bound for Nato forces in Afghanistan .
Recurring pattern
As far as the Pakistani Taliban 's future is concerned in the event of Baitullah Mehsud 's demise , past events provide an interesting barometer reading of what may lie ahead .
More displacement could drive some people into the Taliban 's arms
One has only to look at what has happened recently in the tribal areas when a senior militant leader was killed or when the militants were said to have been defeated .
The most famous example is of Nek Mohammad .
He was the man who launched the Taliban movement as a Pakistani phenomenon .
Starting out with a group of about 20 like - minded men in Waziristan in 2003 , Nek Mohammad soon became the main front man for al - Qaeda 's militants .
During this time he fought several battles with the Pakistan army before eventually signing a peace deal with them .
But that was not to last and soon the army and militants were at war once again .
His death in a drone attack in July 2004 was hailed as a " great victory " by the army who claimed to have " broken the back of the militants " .
At that time he was estimated to have had about 5,000 followers .
Today , there are more than a dozen militant leaders who command at least that number of men and a few who have several times more .
The militants control territory throughout North West Frontier Province and every operation by the army has ultimately ended with them losing territory .
In fact , there is a recurring pattern to the army 's offensives .
Troops nearly always tend to be deployed following international claims that the area in question is newly under al - Qaeda 's control and poses a threat to the country 's nuclear arsenal .
The fighting often ends up leaving a largely aggravated population at the mercy of those from whom they were being rescued .
This in turn can create resentment against the government - if only a handful out of the 2.5 million people forced to leave Swat in the most recent fighting end up joining the Taliban , the militants would still receive hundreds of new recruits into their ranks .
For many people in the war - hit north - west there is increasingly only one choice , join the Taliban or leave their ancestral lands .
Tactics
That is maybe one reason why almost every family in Taliban - dominated areas has a member in the militant forces .
Fighting between the army and the Taliban has caused destruction in Swat
The young glamourise the militants and that - combined with the tribal concept of badal , or an eye for an eye - becomes binding on each family who loses a member in the war .
Every time the army drops a bomb or fires a bullet in the north - west it is in danger of stirring up resentment among some civilians which will create new enemies in future years .
The militants in Swat may well lose the battle over the coming days and the future of Baitullah Mehsud appears increasingly uncertain .
But unless the Pakistani government - and indirectly the international community - changes its tactics , the Taliban can still win the war .

APRIL 15 -- The California woman who gave birth in January to eight babies has filed an application to trademark the word ' Octomom , ' which she wants to slap on disposable diapers and assorted clothing items .
Nadya Suleman , who has shown a knack for cashing in on her post-natal predicament , last Friday filed two applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in a bid to commercially exploit her tabloid - bestowed nickname .
In her April 10 USPTO filings , the 33 - year - old mother of 14 identifies herself as ' Nadya Suleman , AKA Octomom , ' and notes that she wants to use the ' Octomom ' handle on products such as dresses , pants , shirts , and disposable and textile diapers .
Suleman also wants to secure a trademark to use ' Octomom ' in connection with TV variety programming .
As seen in excerpts from Suleman 's USPTO applications , she had to sign a letter consenting to ' the use of my nickname as a Trademark or Servicemark . '
The USPTO applications , which cost Suleman a total of $ 825 and only include a bland logotype , were filed for her by a Whittier , California law firm whose web site reports that it offers ' Intellectual Property and Family Law services . ' ( 7 pages )
A Saudi inventor filed a patent for a " killer chip " which , once implanted , would monitor " undesirables " using a GPS .
Oh , and it also comes with an extra feature : a remote - controlled cyanide dispenser , for murder .

This is like something out of Battle Royal , only real .
Here 's how the invention , which failed to make itthrough German Patent Law , would have worked :
The basic model would consist of a tiny GPS transceiver placed in a capsule and inserted under a person 's skin , so that authorities could track him easily .
Model B would have an extra function - a dose of cyanide to remotely kill the wearer without muss or fuss if authorities deemed he'd become a public threat .
The inventor said the chip could be used to track terrorists , criminals , fugitives , illegal immigrants , political dissidents , domestic servants and foreigners overstaying their visas .

Yeah , got to look out for those dissidents .
Sheesh , this guy is mental .
The German media was first to report this , and luckily it looks like this patent will not be approved , nor should it be - unless they make it available to everyone for ex-boyfriend " monitoring . "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
In a dramatic break from previous policy , the United States will join direct talks between U.N. and European powers and Iran over Tehran 's nuclear program , the State Department announced Wednesday .
Wednesday 's announcement is the latest step by the Obama administration to engage Iran diplomatically .
The Obama administration has asked the European Union 's international policy chief , Javier Solana , to invite Iran to new talks with the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany , State Department spokesman Robert Wood said .
" If Iran accepts , we hope this will be an occasion to seriously engage Iran of how to break the logjam of recent years and work in a cooperative manner to resolve the outstanding international concerns about its nuclear program , " Wood said .
Iran so far has refused Security Council demands to halt its production of enriched uranium , which it has said will be used to fuel nuclear power plants .
The United States has accused Tehran of concealing efforts to develop a nuclear bomb , and the U.N. 's nuclear watchdog agency said it has failed to resolve questions about the aim of Iranian program .
Watch how U.S. policy on Iran is changing »
The Bush administration had insisted that Iran first stop its nuclear program before any talks with the United States or its allies could go forward .
Wednesday 's announcement is the latest step in the Obama administration 's efforts to engage the Islamic republic diplomatically after nearly three decades without formal ties .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , briefly addressing the administration 's decision Wednesday , told reporters that " pursuing very careful engagement on a range of issues that affect our interests and the interests of the world with Iran makes sense . "
" And there 's nothing more important than trying to convince Iran to cease its efforts to obtain a nuclear weapon , " Clinton said at the State Department , where she was meeting Panama 's foreign affairs minister .
Her comments came in response to a reporter 's question about engaging Iran .
Washington , which has not had diplomatic relations with Iran since 1980 , has participated in previous talks only as an observer .
Wood would not speculate about whether a meeting involving Iran and the rest of the group might lead to direct one - on - one meetings of U.S. and Iranian officials .
" It 's a little early to talk about that right now , " he said .
Iran has so far responded coolly to the American overtures .
In a statement carried on Iranian state television Wednesday evening , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Washington " has no right to suggest how other nations should live . "
" Those who have nuclear bombs are backward nations , because the time for threats is over , " Ahmadinejad said .
And in a statement carried by the official IRNA news agency , Ahmadinejad said Iran was " ready to cooperate " toward nuclear disarmament , as long as those efforts did not create obstacles for countries that wish to produce nuclear fuel for civilian power .
No date has been set for the next meeting of the " P - 5 plus 1 " group , which includes the five Security Council permanent members -- the United States , Britain , France , Russia and China -- as well as Germany .
But Wednesday 's announcement comes amidst a variety of signals from both sides that a major diplomatic shift was in the winds .
In March , President Obama delivered a televised message to the Iranian people offering new diplomatic engagement .
And Clinton sat down with an Iranian official at a recent conference in the Netherlands on Afghanistan , but the two diplomats had no one - on - one contact .
During his presidential campaign , Obama called for talks with Iran without pre-conditions -- a proposal sharply criticized by Clinton , then his chief opponent for the Democratic nomination , among others .
Big obstacles to a U.S. - Iranian thaw remain , including reports from Tehran on Wednesday that Iranian authorities have charged an American journalist with espionage .
Clinton told reporters that the the U.S. had asked the Swiss -- who represent U.S. interests in Iran -- for up - to - date information about Roxana Saberi , who has been jailed for nearly three months .
During the March 31 meeting in the Netherlands , the United States delivered a note to Iran that asked for a response on the status of Saberi and American citizens detained or missing in Iran .
U.S. officials say they are still awaiting a response from the Iranians to the note .
CNN 's Charley Keyes contributed to this report .

Each day offers new ventures , maybe it is time to do something creative or maybe just memorable for yourself .
Â
Having been a stay at home mom for many years , you would be surprised at what you can find to do .
Â
I am going to share some things I have done during one of my days at home .
Ever thought of writing a life story ?
Â
Is there some issue , something that you want to remember ?
Â
Maybe there is something you want to leave behind you after you are gone for your loved ones to read or see , you can sit down and write .
Â
Writing not only helps us to clear our thoughts but it also helps us to maybe , recall events , share events , or thoughts with others .
Â
Maybe you just want your writings for yourself , that is fine too .
Â
It does not take much to get started , maybe just as simple as a pad of paper , and a writing utensil , like a pen or pencil .
Â
Take a time when you are not tired to write , because you need to write when you and your mind is fresh .
Â
I like to write pretty much in the early hours of the day , this is when I am at my peak .
Â
I write about issues I have in my life , and I have started writing journals to my children .
Â
Actually the journals were in the making almost five years ago , but I have not spent time on them like I should .
Â
I have three children and I have written to them about their accomplishments , my dreams or my thoughts for them to read .
Â
I figured if one day I was gone , they could refer back to these so they could remember things and possibly share that with their children .
Â
It is good to express yourself when writing .
Â
Remember only you know what you want to say .
Have you ever rearranged things around the house ?
Â
I sure have , I have friends that when they come over to my house , they make the comment "
Have you moved things around again ? "
Â
It is fun for me , I find that when furniture is moved into a different arrangement , it is like bringing things back to a newer state .
Â
I find it very soothing to be able to arrange my furniture , and as long as I can , I will .
Have you joined any book clubs at your local library , or any other organizations to get involved with ?
Â
Ever thought about the libraries book club , usually it is a very broad range of books they share and read , and maybe you might make new friends .
Â
Mom 's clubs are everywhere , they offer friendship , helpful tips and solutions to being a mom and all you need to know .
Â
There is sometimes planning for going out to lunches or dinners , which is nice , especially when t you stay at home , you need that interaction with others too .
Have you tried your hand at writing for money ?
Â
Of course you have or you would not be reading this .
Â
If you are not sure where to start , try places like Ciao.com , or Helium.com .
Â
These are two I frequent and they do give you some money for your ideas , and thoughts .
Â
I do like knowing I can stay at home and still contribute to the house 's finances .
Start a membership at your local gym .
Â
The thought of exercise especially in front of others can be a little intimidating , but maybe you could get a friend or other person to come with you .
Â
This would be a good time to catch up on your friends and they say exercise helps reduce stress , which we all need .
Â
Maybe if a gym is not good try your hand at walking at a local walk way or park .
Â
While you walk you can reflect on yourself or a task at hand you need to get done .
Â
Walking is very therapeutic .
Try your hand at crafting , if you get good enough , think about selling the crafts and taking it one step further and sell on Ebay .
Â
Ebay offers lots of exposure for the seller who really wants it .
Â
I make bird houses , sometimes I paint or refinish something I already have .
Â
It is good for me to make things with my own hands .
Try gardening .
Â
Vegetable gardening or flower gardening can give instant gratitude to you .
Â
You can save money on grocery bills , and if you plant just flowers you will add a habitat for birds , toads , and insects , which adds beauty , and help to our environment .
Get out and explore your world .
Â
When you stay at home there is so much you can get into , and even if you work , try re-discovering things you had a passion for once or take up a new hobby or craft .
Â Â
You will see , itÂ can be as rewarding as you make it .
Since when do you satanists support our military ?
Oh sure ... since you have a Democrat prez ... that is when .
I copied and saved all these wonderful asshole lies of support so when a Republican is in charge again , we shall compare your support of our troops .
Our troops get Rush on in Iraq , they heard who calls them murderers and rapists , they know which side talks against them .
You are a moron , I have seen what you look like , typical liberal , like you should have a lolly pop stuck in your mouth and rammmed down your throat .
Damn , NK is sending off Nukes , Iran says no deal , Israel says NO DEAL .
WHERES ALL THAT FREAKING LOVE FROM YOUR BAD ASS OREO PREZ ?
Dude , 2003 called .
It wants its " liberals do n't support the military " talking point back .
But I 'm glad you kept it real and included the usual dose of racism , homophobia , and fealty to Boss Limbaugh .
We could n't have conservatives start abandoning those principles and -- gasp ! -- become more mainstream electable !
Much nicer in your fringe .
Do n't change a thing .
I notice that while you slam any republican , you also close the threads where people can legitamately repond to an article that is printed against them .
Sounds one sided .
But what the hell , it 's a free country , and free internet , but remember , while you refuse cross therories , you 're holding at bay inteligent thinking , even though it 's against your own beliefs .
May you have a good day , and thank GOD , nobody has yet wished your candidate dead , like they did with President Bush .
I do n't know about this guy 's candidate , but ours won an election and is no longer a candidate .
He 's the president .
But I 'm genuinely thankful that no one has wished him dead .
( Two hate mails later )
Kill the nigger ?
FUCKING KILL LIBERALS and they can all BURN IN HELL ... how is that for free speech ?
Oh well .
I guess GOD does n't deserve thanks for this after all .
And the rest of the week was n't much better .
You are vulgar
BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY YOU ARE TRAITORS MANY OF US AMERICANS ARE STOCKPILING GUNS AND AMMO TO KILL THE LIBERAL FASCISTS .
YOU ARE ALL HITLERS
fuck you , daily krap .
you guys are a -holes to the nth degree , driving partisan divisionism to new heights .
fuck you and die ....
Liberal shit eating pussies
You fucking liberal shits , I will cut your mother fucking pussy lips from all of your mouths .
Rush rules and you can suck his dick and eat his shit !
Fuck you all and I hope you all die a most horrible death after watching your children get raped .
Just kidding or am I ?
Have a nice day .
Sigh .
It never ends .
( By the way , should n't this last guy be embarrassed that his Republicans got their asses kicked by us liberal shit eating pussies ? )
You should do the country a favor and just die and go away ( this website ) .
NO one with any brains listens to you anyway .
It 's just disgusting , how you attack only the right , and ignore all of the horrible things the demorats so every single day .
Hussein is the WORST president in the history of this country and will go down in history as such , he 's doing a great job of it right now .
Plus he 's a flaming racist .
Not even the website is immune from all the death wishing !
Dear Daily HOs , I 'm glad Obama was elected president .
Maybe he and his liberal friends ( including you assholes ) will let in enough terrorists who will blow some shit up .
They wo n't go after middle America ( in which I live in ) because we 're not a large enough target .
No , they will want more dead bodies .
That 's where you come in .
I spent a few minutes on your site and realized that you 're all fucked in the head brainless pussies .
I 'd like to personally kick the shit out of you .
But since you 're probably in New York or Los Angeles , that 's not going to happen .
I 've been to Los Angeles .
What a shithole .
I 'd like to get some good pizza in NY , but not at the risk of running across assholes like anyone on the New York Times , Madonna , David Letterman , or any other cocksucking liberal .
One day , I 'll pick up the newspaper and it will say , Muslim terrorists blow up Manhattan , Boston , Detroit , Los Angles , and Washington , D.C.
As sad as it will be that those stinky ragheads will have spilled precious American blood on our soil , at least most of you liberal assholes will be burnt to a cinder .
Just keep up your liberal ways , letting all the illegal aliens in , handcuffing our military and police , and you 'll see what happens .
I 'll have a box of tissues for my tears , mourning the lost lives , and also a nice bottle of wine knowing that most your you asshole libs are now feeding the worms six feet under .
And in closing , fuck you !
What 's the tally now ?
Let see ... the wingers want Obama , all of us , the website , and five major American cities dead .
But I 'm a bit confused -- he'd like to personally kick the shit out of me , but is too chickenshit to go to New York because he might run into ... people like me !
It 's a delicious mixture of typical conservative false bravado and cowardice .
Quit yer whining cry baby commie bitches !
Go suck a dick and burn in hell , I 'll be driving my SUV and eating something I killed on my ranch .
Who 's yer Daddy , ME !

What do want the United States to be like Denmark with a 60 + % average tax rate , rampant socialism and entitlement programs from the cradle to the grave .
How does that promote true freedom ?
You should all be ashamed .
After all that death wishing , having someone think that we should merely be ashamed is quite charming , in fact .

NEW YORK , May 25 ( Reuters ) - U.S. automaker Chrysler on Monday slammed Indiana State Treasurer Richard Mourdock as making demands that would ultimately push the carmaker into liquidation -- resulting in the loss of more than 4,000 jobs and 9,000 retiree pensions in Indiana alone .
Mourdock , who oversees pension funds invested in Chrysler debt , has objected to Chrysler LLC ’s plan to quickly sell itself in bankruptcy , claiming it is a dangerous path that would hurt pensions for thousands of his state ’s retirees .
The Indiana pension funds have filed court papers requesting that an examiner be appointed to investigate Chrysler ’s business decisions , and that the company be placed in the hands of a Chapter 11 trustee who can act independently of the government .
The funds also mounted a challenge to the company ’s plan in U.S. District Court .
Chrysler claimed in a statement on Monday that Mourdock , a Republican , is willing to put Chrysler in liquidation over less than 1 percent of the three funds ’ assets .
It calculates that the combined Chrysler - related investments in the three state pension funds in question totaled approximately $ 17 million and the cumulative loss under the proposed deal would be about $ 2 million .
“ The treasurer ’s actions lead one to wonder if his motives are financial or political , ” the statement said .
Chrysler filed for bankruptcy in April and announced an industry - changing deal with Italy 's Fiat FIA .
MI after being pummeled by sliding auto sales .
Detroit - based Chrysler has a government deadline of June 15 to close the transaction to sell itself to a “ New Chrysler ” owned by the U.S. and Canadian governments , Chrysler ’s union and Fiat , according to recent court papers .
Chrysler ’s unsecured creditors ’ committee has said in court papers that if the sale were not able to go forward it would mean certain liquidation for the iconic U.S. automaker .
Chrysler , its creditors ’ committee , and Fiat have filed a series of court documents asking the U.S. District Court in Manhattan to reject a request by the pension funds that the court intervene in the bankruptcy case and postpone the sale of Chrysler ’s assets .
Chrysler said in Monday ’s statement it is committed to supporting its operations in Indiana .

The statement below was presented at a press conference by Vickramabahu Karunarathne ( `` Bahu ' ' ) , general secretary of the Nava Sama Samaaja Party ( NSSP , New Socialist Party ) .
It was first published at Liam Macuaid 's blog .
Below the statement is a document that outlines the NSSP 's position on Tamil national self - determination .
* * *
There is an international commotion about the bloodbath and the human disaster in Lanka .
It can lead eventually to an international intervention that could enslave everybody .
We called this press conference to make everybody aware of the developing situation .
Government leaders claim that they have confined the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) activity to a very small area near Mulative .
It is said that the LTTE leadership and the last battalions are within the 15,000 people caught in the Area .
The LTTE challenges these figures and say that around 120,000 are cornered in the limited area .
The UN says it is more than 50,000 .
Whatever it may be , the only access to food and other necessities for these people is the Red Cross shipments that are supposed to arrive twice a week to this enclosure with the government 's permission .
This shipment includes 25 tonnes of food and medicine , and the boat takes back is about 500 passengers .
There are more than 2000 wounded and sick in the area waiting to go out but the government has not made any extra arrangements for that .
While these people are confined to this hellhole the government is continuing its attacks .
Shells and multibarrel rockets are used day and night .
In the last few days over 2000 were killed and many more are injured .
The Sri Lankan government claims that the LTTE is responsible for this misery and demands that the Tigers should unconditionally surrender .
But at the same time the government says that the Tigers are criminals already convicted by Lankan and Indian courts .
Therefore they will be punished accordingly .
In that event there is no room for any discussion at all .
the Tigers are assumed to be just criminals and not even an indirect product of Tamil national problem .
At the same time they have accepted that nearly 3000 LTTE cadres are in their custody .
But nobody knows where they are .
It is suspected that they are kept at some desolate place in Vanni .
Their fate is totally unknown .
In the recent past many who were in state custody were killed in ``confrontations '' with the prisoners , when they were taken out of the place of imprisonment !
Among them , some were LTTE suspects .
Wijeweera , a Sinhala rebel was burned alive while he was in army custody .
In that background , if the LTTE leaders surrender their fate will be a shameful humiliating death .
It will be a severe discredit to the struggle and the Tamil people .
In that reality we ask who has the right to demand the LTTE surrender .
We , the Left do not agree with the ferocious methods and the bourgeois politics of the Tigers .
But they are Tamil liberation fighters and they have the right to be treated as such .
Bogus demands of the government have no meaning .
Government is demanding that the Tamil people be allowed to leave Tiger areas so that Tiger militants are left behind to be slaughtered by the army .
Some lunatics blame the Tigers for not agreeing to this demand !
If these ladies and gentlemen are so committed to the innocent lives they should demand the government to agree to a genuine ceasefire .
The people who have entered the Sinhala army zone are kept in military protected camps .
These are open prisons without adequate facilities .
No real information about the situation is available from independent sources .
Those who divulge information obtained secretly , are punished or thrown out of the country .
In such a situation there could be a large number of displaced Tamils who are willingly with the Tiger army .
Afterall , to a Tamil misery under the Tamil army may be better than being a prisoner of the alien Sinhala forces .
This tragic situation has developed into an international uprising of the Tamil people , or more correctly a Dravidian universal protest .
It is severely felt in India and spreading into the developed world .
There are violent mass agitations everywhere .
This could lead to an induction of foreign forces in Lanka .
We must stop this debacle and bloodletting .
Sinhala soldiers are also killed and wounded in thousands .
All of them are from poor peasant families .
Misery spreads into all corner of the country .
We demand that the government stop the war and go for a peace agreement now !
Right of self - determination of Ilankai Tamils
By Dr Vickramabahu Karunarathne
The right of self - determination of Tamil - speaking people is a foremost issue in modern Lankan society .
Though it is related to the Tamil vs. Sinhala conflicts narrated in various chronicles , the present form arises out of the inability to construct a democratic , plural , civil society .
Though Sri Lanka ( the Sinhala equivalent of Ilankai ) is considered a nation by the United Nations Organisation , Sri Lankan nationality is yet to be recognised by the masses here .
People in Lanka consider themselves as Sinhala , Tamil , Muslim , Burgher , Veddha , etc. and rarely as Sri Lankans .
In that sense it is a society of nationalities .
As a Marxist , I consider nations are really built on capitalist market economy .
I refer to a community as a nationality if , that community of people are in conscious struggle to be a nation but not yet matured fully as a nation .
The word nation is loosely used to represent any group of people with a common language .
But such a definition is not useful in understanding problems of nation in modern society .
The identities Sinhala and Tamil were used in Lanka for a long period of time stretching as far back as 3rd century BC .
But the entity represented by the term Tamil or Sinhala is very different at different times .
For example , Sinhala was used in the Anuradhapura period to represent a Vansa , a clan of people associated with a particular agriculture based on a special irrigation system .
These people were considered to be of Aryan descent .
Aryans were the nomadic people who invaded India around 2000 BC and over - ran Dravidian clan societies clustered around the Indus valley and elsewhere .
It is widely believed that around 500 BC some Aryan people came to Lanka and overpowered the Dravidian society that existed there .
Thus there were Vansa clashes in that early period of history .
These Vansa clashes continued until the end of Rajarata civilisation and the emergence of semi-feudal society in the wet zone .
In this society divisions were based more on trade caste groups .
When we look at the Kandyan kingdom before the takeover by the British , we see that the word Sinhala is used to represent the ruling elite .
The Radala - Mudali elite referred to themselves as the Sinhala .
In this scenario not only the other caste groups in the Kandyan areas were left out of the Sinhala identity , but also the entire community in the low country who spoke Sinhala as their mother tongue .
At this stage , caste was more important than any other clan identity .
The word jatiya , the Sinhala word used in general today to represent a nation , was used widely at that stage to represent caste .
Even today if one asks a Kandyan villager about his jatiya he may assume that as a reference to his caste .
In any case at that time and until recently people in Lanka were more loyal to their caste group than any other form of community .
Sinhala royalty always thought it is better to marry from Tamil royalty than to a lower caste person from the Sinhala kingdom .
This thinking was not confined to the royalty but common to almost all caste groups .
Even today , such thinking exists in spite of Sinhala vs. Tamil national clashes .
I explain all these in order to show that the Tamil or Sinhala nations as we know them today did not exist in the past .
Nation building is a relatively new phenomenon .
It means that a community with the same language and tradition will unite to work democratically .
This is the positive side of an emerging nation , its ability to break down caste and other parochial barriers to unite a community with equality and fraternity .
In the recent past we saw the emergence of several nationalities in Lanka .
The Sinhala nationality emerged with the temperance movement under Anagaarika Dharmapala .
Parallel to this there were movements launched by Arumugam Nawalar and Siddhi Lebbe .
The Veddha community also asserted its identity under Tissahamy and others .
Thus when the British went away in 1948 , Lanka remained a prison house of several nationalities .
Power was concentrated in the hands of the English - speaking elite who behaved like a separate nationality .
A tiny community of less than 1 million fake Anglo - Saxons , who relished imitating Anglo - American upper classes , appropriated and held all economic , political and social power in their hands .
The Tamil upper classes consider themselves a part of this elite .
In fact early leaders who collaborated with British rule were famous Tamils such as Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan .
It was in their interest to build a state power on the basis of Sinhala Buddhists .
This policy was started by D.S. Senanayake and continued with vigour by the Bandaranaikes .
They disenfranchised Tamil plantation workers and made the majority of the working class stateless .
A consistent campaign of discrimination was aimed at the Tamil - speaking people .
While English remained the language of the rulers , Sinhala was made the sole official language to be used as a device for discrimination .
Sinhala colonisation schemes were established in Tamil areas to create communal disharmony and fool the Sinhala poor masses .
So - called standardisation was used to discriminate against Tamil students .
All this pushed the Tamils into protest and rebellion .
As early as 1930 even the Tamil elite had to break away and put separate demands to the British Raj .
Then they demanded a 50/50 share in the legislative assembly , meaning that the Sinhala majority should get no more than 50 % seats .
Later the Federal Party was formed with the demand for autonomy for the north and the east .
In the 1950s , the Marxist movement led by the Lanka Sama Samaaja Party ( LSSP ) fought against this fraud and stood for equality , democracy and socialism .
The Communist Party ( CP ) in the early 1950s passed a resolution accepting the right of self - determination for the Tamils but nothing was done to take this to the public .
The Tamils and other national minority groups had much faith and expected fair play from them .
Later , however , the LSSP / CP leaders made a fundamental mistake and joined the capitalist government of Mrs Sirima Bandaranaike .
Once in power they also became pawns in the hands of Sinhala chauvinism .
In fact Dr Colvin De Silva , who once said “ One language - two nations ” became the man who formulated the Buddhist theocratic constitution .
This total betrayal led to much disillusionment among Tamil youth .
Failure of the old left movement against Sinhala Buddhist chauvinism opened the stage for violence against the Tamil people .
Racial riots broke out several times , the worst of which was in 1983 .
All this led to the liberation struggle of the Tamil people .
Today , the Lankan Tamil nationality is a complex entity .
First , the so - called native Tamils of the north and east have developed as Eelam Tamils with a recognisable homeland .
Their national consciousness has developed to a high degree among them .
The existing armed struggle for Tamil liberation is based on them .
Under the memorandum of understanding signed by Ranil Wickremesinghe in 2002 , more than one - third of the Tamil homeland was accepted to be under the direct control of the LTTE .
Second , the plantation Tamils of the up - country , descendents of south Indian Tamil workers brought to Lanka by the British Raj , have not identified entirely with the Eelam liberation struggle .
Certainly the youth is highly influenced by the struggle in the north and east .
But their demands are different , being very largely socioeconomic .
Land and citizenship rights , greater autonomy for Tamil areas , and greater Tamil participation in local administration are some of their demands .
Third , there is a substantial Tamil community living in Colombo and its suburbs .
They are a combination of native and Indian Tamils .
Except for the recent refugees , others are more interested in getting equality and justice than supporting the liberation struggle .
However , in spite of these divisions , all Tamils are living under fear and repression .
On the other hand , the war has its effect on all Tamils irrespective of their actual connection to the liberation struggle .
The Nava Sama Samaaja Party ( NSSP ) from its inception defended the right of self - determination of the Tamil - speaking people .
Before becoming a party , as a group within the LSSP , in 1974 we came out with our analysis of the Tamil national question .
We explained that Tamil nationality is emerging , fighting for its self - determination .
The only unity possible is the voluntary union of the two nationalities .
For this , recognition of the right of self - determination of Tamil people is a precondition .
Acceptance of equality , autonomy and the right of self - determination is the only basis for a democratic unity .
Since 1974 we have been fighting for this position in all our political campaigns .
In spite of many difficulties , we have managed to take this message among the Sinhala people .
We have influenced the thinking of almost all political parties of Lanka .
Concepts of equality , autonomy and the right of self - determination are now very widely discussed .
Understanding of the masses has increased tremendously .
And now there is widespread resentment against the war efforts of the government .
In 1994 , Vasudava Nanayakkara and a few others broke away and collaborated with SLFP - led governments .
Though they pay lip service to the Tamil liberation , in practice they have become a part of the treacherous group led by CP and LSSP .
It is clear that the Western powers are now backing the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime .
We explained all along that it is futile to expect the global capitalist powers to intervene here to safeguard the interest of Tamils and Muslims or any other minority .
Many Tamil leaders believe that the Indian rulers will help them to achieve freedom from discrimination and oppression .
In fact they appealed for military intervention .
However , the Indian intervention became a nightmare for the Tamils .
Today Sinhala chauvinists , such as Gunadasa Amarasekera , openly claim that Indian intervention was a god - sent chance for them and regret that it was not fully utilised to crush the LTTE .
Now , the same thing is repeated in relation to the Western powers led by the Americans .
The Tamils have to accept that it is foolish to expect support for the Tamil struggle from the West against the Mahinda Rajapaksa government that collaborates with the development program of the West .
On the other hand the LTTE appears to believe that suicidal attacks by the Tamil youth can achieve liberation .
So far no efforts are made to take the issue among the left democratic forces internationally .
The Left Front ( NSSP ) will take the issue of Tamil Liberation among left democratic forces both locally and internationally .
What does it all mean for the stock market ?
Art Cashin , UBS Financial Services director of floor operations , offered CNBC his insights .
First , Cashin touched on the US dollar , which fell to a five - month low against a basket of currencies , despite this week 's successful Treasurys auctions .
" I 'm really concerned about the dollar , " he declared .
" I 'm trying to figure out whether it's [ the decline ] due to overt market action or covert government action . "
" Maybe the government is quite content to see the dollar fall .
... But there 's a risk of competitive devaluations " among world governments .
Cashin took on the roller - coaster of Treasurys yield spikes and rush sales .
Although many analysts predicted a bond bubble in recent months , he scoffs at the idea that their prescience should make anyone lackadaisical about the situation :
" Just because you know something 's going to happen does n't mean you should be calm about it : ' Gee , I see that iceberg .
Wow , we just hit it .
I think that means the ship 's going to sink . ' "
" We need to fund a huge , huge deficit .
And we need cooperation from outside [ the U.S. ] to do it . "
" This is a very , very dangerous period we 're going through . "

It seemed like a coup for feminism when Slate , an online magazine , launched a new , women - focused website , Double X , last month .
Declaring its dedication to " tackling subjects high and low " in voices that were " unabashedly intellectual without being dry or condescending " , Double X burst on to the blogosphere , seemingly ready to tackle the knotty question of what it means - and takes - to be a fully liberated woman today .
Except that , instead of squaring up to the sexual politics of the outside world , the site chose to fight its first battle with one of its own , accusing Jezebel - one of America 's biggest and liveliest websites for women - of damaging women , degrading its own writers and betraying the quest for true sexual equality .
Jezebel is a tabloid - style website dedicated to " Celebrity , sex , fashion for women - without airbrushing " .
Based in the US , it has almost 900,000 readers across the world .
Its writers lead divided lives : landing some hard - hitting feminist punches - such as raising funds for the victims of " honour " killings in Basra - while at the same time writing salaciously and candidly about their choice to live lives of unashamed promiscuity .
It was in response to one of these articles that Double X lit the fuse that has set the online global community alight .
Under the heading " The trouble with Jezebel : how Jezebel is hurting women " , it accused its rival of mistaking self - indulgence for acting in pursuit of a political goal .
Double X columnist Linda Hirshman , also a contributor to the New York Times and the Washington Post , referred to an hour - long television appearance by Tracie Egan , a Jezebel blogger who goes by the moniker " Slut Machine " , and Maureen " Moe " Tkacik , in which the two young women refused to engage with a serious discussion about sexual politics and culture .
Shrugging off a question about rape and sexual responsibility , Tkacik casually explained why she did n't report her own date rape to the police .
" I had better things to do , " she said .
" Like drinking more . "
After the programme , presenter Lizz Winstead explained how shocked she had been by the behaviour of the young women .
Writing on her Huffington Post blog , Winstead said : " They do not understand the influence they have over the women who read them , nor do they accept any responsibility as role models for young women who are coming of age searching for lifestyles to emulate . "
In last week 's article for Double X , Hirshman singled out Egan and Tkacik as " a symptom of the weaknesses in the model of perfect egalitarian sexual freedom " .
The Jezebel website , she argued , is guilty of promoting the belief that modern - day feminism is simply " doing what feels good to you " .
In doing so , it uses the language of old - style feminism to betray the movement 's ideals .
Hirshman , author of Get to Work : A Manifesto for Women of the World , added : " It 's the supposed concern with feminism that makes the site so problematic .
The Jezebels are ... a living demonstration of the chaotic possibilities the movement always contained . "
The writer said that she found the attitudes particularly surprising because they " look a lot like the natural heirs of feminism : young , college - educated , urban ( mostly New York ) , single , hard - working , sexually liberated " .
Her accusations have reverberated around the global online community .
The Jezebel website has responded with " Who are you calling a bad feminist ? " , in which Hirshman is decried as creating a " victim - shaming diatribe " and for promoting a feminist philosophy that is deeply sexist .
" I have seen misogyny and , most of the time , it looks a lot like the ideology Hirshman has the audacity to call ' feminism ' , " the article stated .
The argument has become so furious that others have stepped in , with all guns blazing .
Speaking to the Observer , Naomi Wolf , author of Give Me Liberty : A Handbook for American Revolutionaries , agrees with Hirshman .
" Third - wave feminism is pluralistic , strives to be multi-ethnic , is pro-sex and tolerant of other women 's choices , " she said .
" It has led to an embrace of what was once so politically suspect - the notion that you can be a ' lipstick lesbian ' or a ' riot grrrl ' [ referring to a feminist punk movement that emerged in the 90s ] if you want to be , that you can choose your persona and your freedom for yourself .
" But that very individualism , which has been great for feminism 's rebranding , is also its weakness : it can be fun and frisky , but too often it 's ahistorical and apolitical .
As many older feminists justly point out , the world is n't going to change because a lot of young women feel confident and personally empowered , if they do n't have grassroots groups or lobbies to advance woman - friendly policies , help break through the glass ceiling , develop decent work - family support structures or solidify real political clout .
" But feminists are in danger if we do n't know our history , and a saucy tattoo and a condom do not a revolution make , " she added .
" The fact is , we know the answers to western women 's problems : the way is mapped out , the time for theory is pretty much over .
We know the laws and the policies we need to achieve full equality .
What we lack is a grassroots movement that will drive the political will .
' Lipstick ' or lifestyle feminism wo n't produce that movement alone . "
Julie Bindel , a feminist campaigner and journalist , admitted being infuriated by women like Egan and Tkacik .
" Feminism is not the freedom to act like a dickhead , " she said .
" These women are individualists , not feminists .
They are lazy , bone - idle women who have no interest taking part in a political movement for change but are trying to get credibility for their selfish lives by playing identification politics .
You can't claim to be a feminist simply because you 're a woman . "
Sandrine Levêque , campaigns manager at Object , the human rights organisation which challenges the sexual objectification of women in popular culture , agreed .
" It 's almost like what was seen as sexist 20 years ago has been repackaged as empowerment and liberation for women in the 21st century , " she said .
" It is difficult to make choices in today 's pornified culture which bombards us with the message that raunch culture is where it's at for women in 2009 . "
Younger feminists , however , are more inclined to be critical of Hirshman .
" When it comes to Double X , I think we 're just left with questions - is it feminist , or is it not feminist ?
Why did it host a story blaming another woman for not reporting being raped ?
What is promiscuity ?
What does that mean ?
To me , it speaks of trying to slut - shame women who are having consensual sex as and when they want it , " said Jess McCabe , editor of the F Word , a British website that describes itself as feminist .
" There is no such thing as a bad feminist .
Feminism is a social justice movement , it is not about chiding other women , or establishing yet another set of standards for women to be judged against .
We all mess up - we 've all been raised in a sexist , racist , transphobic , heteronormative society , and guess what , that affects our behaviour .
We all also differ in terms of what feminism means to us . "
Ellie Levenson , author of the forthcoming book The Noughtie Girl 's Guide to Feminism , is also critical of Hirshman 's definition of " good " and " bad " feminism .
" A lot of the criticism against Jezebel is against women being open about their sexual antics , " she said .
" Feminism is about women choosing how to behave and having the same rights and freedoms to behave badly as men do , so in order to make these choices we need to be able to read about women who have made all kinds of choices . "
The main problem with feminism today , added Levenson , is that it has become a word that people do n't want to be associated with .
" But when you start asking them whether they believe in equal rights for men and women they say , yes , absolutely .
So it is the word and not the concept that is the problem . "
Leveque agreed .
Feminism today is very definitely alive and fiercely kicking .
" Just look at the number of feminist groups launching up and down the UK , from the Million Women Rise march in London , from the resurgency of reclaim - the - night marches , from the growth of feminist blogs , " she said .
" The tide is slowly growing , and it is badly needed , " she added .
" Things like the rape conviction rate being so pathetic it is almost non-existent , women 's services facing closure and the pay gap actually increasing - there is more of a need for feminist activism than ever . "
A movement rich in diversity
• Gloria Steinem , Betty Friedan and Susan Brownmiller defined the revolutionary feminism of the 60s and 70s .
They protested at Miss World contests and rejected the stay - at - home role and other aspects of traditional femininity .
• They clashed with the radical feminists , including Andrea Dworkin , Catharine MacKinnon , Mary Daly and Germaine Greer , who believed that women were oppressed by men .
• Then came the " riot grrl " phenomenon of the early 90s and Generation X , who were more likely to talk ( very ) dirty and less likely to oppose pornography .
• The newest strain is the new / power feminist , epitomised by Naomi Wolf and Natasha Walter , who dislike the image of the strident feminist .
• Then there 's pop-feminism / feminism " lite " .
This is Spice Girls feminism : girl power .
Feminism as a fleeting fashion trend .
Buffy the Vampire Slayer as a feminist icon .
• Finally , there are post - feminists , who believe feminism is dead .
Heroines are Margaret Thatcher and Camille Paglia .
• This article was amended on Tuesday 26 May 2009 .
We said that McCabe agreed that feminism was alive and fiercely kicking .
This should have been attributed to Leveque .
This has been corrected .

Weins tops the list as the best food travel vlogger .
He takes you on a culinary journey around the world .
Andrea Scott says she would never throw a candy wrapper on the ground .
“ Littering is one of my pet peeves , and I always told my kids they ’d be in big trouble if I catch them doing it , ” said Ms. Scott , a 43 - year - old financial executive , as she sat outside an office tower on Michigan Avenue in Chicago on a recent sunny afternoon .
“ I see people throw stuff out their car windows , and I cringe . ”
Yet she confesses that she routinely discards cigarette butts on the sidewalk .
For her and countless other American smokers , cigarette butts are an exception to the no-littering rule .
“ Are n’t cigarettes biodegradable ? ” volunteered Libby Moustakas , a co-worker who was enjoying a smoking break with Ms. Scott .
But dozens of municipalities across the nation have had enough .
Weary of the butts ’ unsightliness and the costs of sweeping them up , cities have passed bans on smoking on beaches and playgrounds .
In San Francisco , Mayor Gavin Newsom said last week that he would go a step further , seeking a 33 - cents - a - pack tax to cover the $ 11 million that the city spends annually to remove cigarette litter .
Nationally , cigarette butts account for one - quarter or more of the items tossed onto streets and other roadways , San Francisco and other cities report .

Japan ’s Wages Fall at Fastest Pace Since 2002 on Output Slump
Japan ’s wages dropped at the steepest pace in more than six years in March as manufacturers slashed overtime pay to cope with a collapse in exports .
Monthly wages , including overtime and bonuses , dropped 3.7 percent from a year earlier , the most since July 2002 , the Labor Ministry said today in Tokyo .
Overtime payments slid an unprecedented 20.8 percent as manufacturers cut extra working hours by a record 49.5 percent , the report showed .
The government has been tracking the figures since 1990 .
Weekly wages fell at the fastest rate in 60 years in February as City bonuses were slashed and workers agreed to reduced hours in the wake of recession , the latest official figures show .
The Office for National Statistics said average weekly earnings fell 5.8 pc compared with the same month last year , to £ 459.10 .
The private sector took the full force of the fall in weekly earnings , down sharply by 7.7 pc at £ 463.50 , while average weekly earnings in the public sector actually rose by 3.2 pc to £ 442.90 .
Bonuses in the financial services fell to £ 549.90 a week in February - which is part of the peak period for bonus payments - from £ 1,312.80 .
" We certainly have n't seen anything like this in the last 60 years - and probably not in peacetime since the 1930s .
In that sense it 's much like everything else in the economy , " said Michael Saunders , chief UK economist at Citigroup .
Across the country , workers ' earnings are stagnating or , in some cases , declining .
For many Americans , the setbacks are all the more troubling because they have lost so much wealth in recent months , with the value of their homes and retirement packages plummeting .
Employers big and small have resorted to slashing hours and once - unthinkable wage cuts .
In March , staffing agencies that work for Microsoft agreed to a 10 percent reduction in their bill rate .
In April , hotel operators in New York City asked unionized waiters , housekeepers and bellhops to reopen their contract and accept wage cuts .
State governments such as Indiana 's have frozen pay , while others , including Maryland and California , have furloughed employees .
According to a recent Washington Post - ABC
News poll , more than a third of Americans say they or someone in their household has had their hours or pay cut in the past few months .
That 's a nine - point increase since a similar poll was conducted in February .
The previous U.S. recession , in 2001 , was relatively weak and did n't last the full year .
But once inflation is factored in , wages actually fell , sapping workers ' buying power , and did n't return to pre-recession levels until 2006 , just before the economy fell into its latest funk .
As a result , from 2000 to 2007 , the median income of American households , when adjusted for inflation , fell by $ 324 , according to the Commerce Department .
Wages for new hires have already fallen , according to an index compiled by the Society for Human Resource Management , a trade association based in Alexandria .
Temporary workers ' hourly rates are shrinking , too .
Joanie Ruge , senior vice president of the staffing firm Adecco Group North America , said her company 's clients have shaved as much as 10 percent off their rates .
Trends In Disposable Personal Income
Notice that DPI growth became very weak in the era of biggest debt growth , yet it was strong when debt growth was subdued .
So much for the notion that inflating money supply and credit ' creates wealth ' .
It is not only a theoretically indefensible position , the empirical data confirm it as well .
Household Debt Service Payments Rise
Household Obligations Rise
Total Consumer Credit
A few days ago I bought a Microchip Zena ZigBee sniffer .
This USB HID device comes with simple software for Windows that captures and decodes 2.4 GHz 802.15.4 , ZigBee , MiWi ( Microchip stack ) and MiWi -P2P traffic .
It ’s $ 150 , which is a little steep considering that it is a PIC18LF with USB and a MRF24J40 radio , but I ’ve had fun playing with it all the same .
The Zena 3.0 sniffer software provides a basic per-packet view of frames .
I guess we are all spoiled by Wireshark , but I was hoping for more detail and a better UI .
The Zena sniffer can save a capture in a proprietary file format , and can export selected frames ( to the clipboard ) in space - delimited hex bytes .
A cool accompanying feature is the network configuration display interface where Zena will identify all the parent / child relationships observed .
You can specify a BMP background as a floorplan and move the nodes to their physical locations as well .
With no Linux support , I decided to write my own user space Linux driver to capture packets with the goal of integrating it into libpcap captures and other tools including Kismet Newcore .
Plugging into a Linux box , it was clear that the device was using the USB HID , which was good news for me since it would be simpler to reverse the configuration details .
Using the Snoopy Pro USB sniffer , I was able to look at the USB packets , observing data from frames shown by the sniffer , as well as recording the configuration activity based on the channel I specified to capture on .
With this information , it was straightforward to identify the USB endpoint 0x01 as the control channel ( for setting the channel ) and USB endpoint 0x81 as the data endpoint ( for delivering frames ) .
Using PyUSB with the excellent Pymissle project by Scott Weston as an example , I quickly put together a tool that can set the channel number and capture frames from the Zena device , dumping the hex bytes to stdout .
The Python script is available here .
It ’s hack , but it was enough to get me started on what will be my next post : zbfind , a location tracking and identification tool for ZigBee and 802.15.4 networks .

Ontario's government - run liquor stores and unionized employees have reached a tentative deal , averting a strike during the peak summer sales period .
The deal comes after negotiators from both sides pushed past a midnight deadline .
The key negotiating issue for the union was fighting for the rights of casual workers .
The union has said those employees do n't receive vacation , sick time or benefits , and can be called in to work as little as two hours at a time .
A source close to the talks says terms of the deal include benefits for casual workers and more opportunities for full - time jobs .
Employees are working feverishly to replenish supplies after the threat of a strike prompted a run on booze across the province .
The union 's bargaining team unanimously agreed on the deal and is planning a ratification vote as soon as possible .
Long line - ups of customers with full carts at some downtown outlets gave way to a calm restocking of shelves and a more typical trickle of business .
A strike would have been the first in LCBO history .
As the stores neared closing time last night , worried shoppers stripped shelves bare at some outlets , including the large store at Yonge St. and Summerhill Ave.
Vodka in particular was hit hard there .
" I hear a lot of LCBO stores are already sold out , " said Catherine Wu , 27 , marching out with satchels containing $ 170 worth of booze .
In long lineups that caught some stores unprepared , long - standing complaints about the LCBO naturally rose to the surface .
Marika Pick and Carlie Clough waited in line with 40 bottles of red and white wine for a TV cooking show they said was in production .
" This supply should last about four weeks , " Pick said .
" If the strike is still on after that , we 'll go to Buffalo . "
" Or we 'll make our own , " said Clough .
At Hair of the Dog at Wood and Church Sts. , in the heart of gay Toronto , staff also stocked up " three times more " than the usual order , in anticipation of Pride Week , said assistant manager Bill Mann .
The order , which included " cases and cases " of vodka , was so large they filled their liquor room and had to keep the rest off site , bringing it in as needed , said Mann

" We 're expecting this is for Pride , " he said .

Last month , LCBO workers voted 93 per cent in favour of a strike mandate .
Their collective agreement expired March 31 .

Nothing says getting out of a recession like keeping up the behavior that got us into it in the first place :
In the first quarter of 2009 ,
The U.S. economy shrank at a pace of 6.1 % in the first quarter
Yet …
Purchases by individuals rose at an annual 2.2 % rate , the first time personal spending rose since the second quarter of 2008 .
But …
Personal income decreased $ 29.1 billion , or 0.2 percent , and disposable personal income ( DPI ) decreased $ 10.5 billion , or 0.1 percent , in February , according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis .
Personal consumption expenditures ( PCE ) increased $ 17.2 billion , or 0.2 percent .
So , let ’s get this straight .
Personal income decreased by approximately $ 30 billion , the GDP shrank by 6.1 % , and yet people are spending 2.2 % more than they were a year ago ?
Are you people trying to get your god damn flat screen TV ’s foreclosed ?!

On the heels of the hate crimes vote in the House – a vote where the religious right claimed that laws against murder would somehow stop them from verbally criticizing gays – the religious right has just launched a campaign against Hannah Montana star Miley Cyrus simply for saying that Jesus loves everyone , including gay people .
Talk about intolerant .
Now we ’re going to threaten TV shows because their stars are n’t homophobes ?
Because they believe that Jesus loved everybody ?
Should we throw her in jail too ?
It ’s also ironic that the religious right was just all up in arms a week ago when blonde bimbette Miss California lost the Miss USA beauty pageant .
They claim she lost because the judges did n’t like her answer to a question on gay marriage ( she ’s against it , but her answer also showed a decided lack of knowledge of the English language ) .
The religious right has claimed that since Miss California lost , it shows that all of America is now in danger from the gay agenda .
I know , it ’s all a bit weird , but what ’s important is that the religious right just launched a well - funded ad campaign featuring Miss California ( paid for by the Mormon bigots ? ) , talking about how intolerant the world is for not picking Miss California over Miss Arizona , and then the next day they launch a campaign against a TV star for simply saying she ’s pro-gay .
Here ’s what the intolerant homophobes just emailed out to their action - alert list .
First here is what Miley Cyrus said that is so offensive :
“ Everyone deserves to love and be loved and most importantly smile . ”
“ Jesus loves you and your partner and wants you to know how much he cares !
That ’s like a daddy not loving his lil boy cuz he ’s gay and that is wrong and very sad !
“ Like I said everyone deserves to be happy . ”
“ God ’s greatest commandment is to love .
And judging is not loving . ”
“ I am a Christian and I love you – gay or not – because you are no different than anyone else !
We are all God ’s children . ”
Wow , pretty nasty stuff .
Love .
God ’s commandments .
We are all God ’s children .
Stone that woman .
And here is how the bigots at the American Family Association reacted :
Such statements will send the wrong message to our children who are influenced by this teenage megastar .
Parents need to realize that Cyrus is not the positive role model she was once thought to be ….
Clearly she is confused and does not understand the Bible .
Seriously , these people are evil .
They clearly do n’t worship the same God as you and me .
They do n’t even think Catholics are Christians .
And just as their philosophical forbears would do anything to stop blacks from gaining equal access to the American dream , today ’s religious bigots will stop at nothing – even calling Matthew Shepard ’s brutal murder “ a hoax ” – in order to bash the gays one more time .
And the GOP wonders why it ’s only at 20 % in the polls .
With people like these extremists controlling the Republican party , God help the Republicans – 20 % may be their high point for a long time coming .

AROUND THE WEB
Free Software Foundation Europe ( FSFE ) was conceived in early 2000 , pregnancy took about a year , and in early 2001 my decision to make the creation and success of Free Software Foundation Europe ( FSFE ) my first and foremost priority in life was clear .
This was eight years , six months , and a couple of days ago , and the organisation has meanwhile survived birth , infancy , childhood and adolescence – in particular thanks to the great people that have been part of FSFE over the years .
The founding group consisted of people from Germany , France and Sweden , with Italy joining during the first General Assembly in 2001 .
There has been a healthy fluctuation of people and positions over the years .
Of the seven initial founders four are still members in the association , and two have had four entire two - year terms in their positions .
The other positions were typically held for 3 - 5 years , which is long enough to build up and pass on experience , but not so long that the organisation needs to be concerned about dictators for life .
This was a design principle for FSFE from the start .
Our goal was to build an organisation that will survive every individual member .
We wanted an organisation that was strong on principle and would be able to protect this set of principles for the future but at the same time incorporated the best of the European experience and culture , including the capability to translate these principles to a changing world .
That is why FSFE has always worked hard to redefine and improve itself .
The culture in FSFE has evolved into one that embraces development and change , to give it our best shot , and then see what we could have done better .
It has always been a privilege to work with so many people who are capable of carrying such an environment forward .
But in order for FSFE to truly embrace change on all levels , to experience it as something normal regardless of the person concerned , it was necessary to give the organisation practical experience with change on all positions , the President included .
That is why during the 2008 General Assembly in Zürich I informed my colleagues in the Assembly that for the upcoming election during the 2009 General Assembly I would no longer be available as President .
The choice of timing seemed logical , because FSFE will never be more prepared for this step .
It is a grown up international organisation incorporating some of the best people I have ever had the pleasure to work with .
The financial situation is sufficiently stable , internal process is working smoothly , the organisation has an excellent track record and built significant political capital and contacts over the years , and the waters in which FSFE is currently sailing are as smooth as they will ever be .
The last year was spent preparing this change , preparing the organisation , its volunteers , and finding the right people to take FSFE to the next level .
Looking at the new team I do not believe that we could have found a better group of people .
Karsten Gerloff , FSFE ’s new President , spent the past years at the UNU - MERIT , working with people such as Rishab Ghosh to provide the scientific basis for the political change around Free Software .
Before that he was an intern at FSFE , working with me at the United Nations , specifically the World Intellectual property Organisation ( WIPO ) , he is familiar with FSFE ’s policy work and I have no doubt that he will be able to represent Free Software effectively on all levels .
Fernanda Weiden , FSFE ’s new Vice - President , has been an active part of the Latin American and European Free Software community for many years .
As a co-organiser of the Free Software Forum in Porto Alegre , organiser of the world ’s first conference on women in Free Software and an active part of the Free Software Foundation Network for many years , she combines exceptional technical skills with a passion for Free Software and many years of coordinative experience .
Christian Holz , FSFE ’s new Executive Director , is a Fellow turned Executive Director .
His classic business background , among others with PricewaterhouseCoopers ( PwC ) , give him the skills and experience needed to manage FSFE ’s daily operations .
He had decided to become involved with Free Software and work with FSFE through the Fellowship when the Executive Director position was announced .
We found him pragmatic , focussed and a good social fit for FSFE .
Adriaan de Groot , FSFE ’s designated FTF Coordinator , is known to many people in the Free Software community from his work as a KDE e.V. and NLUUG board member , and has been involved in FSFE ’s Freedom Task Force for some time now .
His experience and skills make him uniquely skilled to be our next FTF Coordinator .
Matthias Kirschner , FSFE ’s new Germany and Fellowship coordinator , has been with FSFE for several years now , starting his career as FSFE ’s first - ever intern , contributing to the set - up of the Fellowship .
Over time he has become a valued member of the General Assembly , and after his studies in politics and management are now finished , he is also taking over as FSFE ’s German representative .
These five people were the group with which I worked intensively to prepare the 2009 General Assembly , define the strategic planning and milestones .
Working together was a great pleasure and almost made me regret that I wo n’t get to be part of this new and powerful team for FSFE .
But you should know that their plans are also my plans , and they have my fullest support .
So these are the changes in FSFE ’s structure , but of course there is also plenty of continuity .
Reinhard Müller has kindly agreed to stay on as FSFE ’s Financial Officer , overseeing the work of the new Executive Team as a kind of “ internal auditor . ”
Cristian Rigamonti will continue to work on FSFE ’s systems , and Giacomo Poderi will continue to work on FSFE ’s newsletter .
FSFE will continue to have my full commitment as a volunteer and member of the General Assembly to participate in the strategic planning of the organisation .
So this change does not reduce the experience available within the organisation .
It increases it by adding the impressive background of the new Executive Team .
As my parting request , I would like to ask all of you to give this new team your support .
If you are not yet a Fellow , please join now .
If you have thought about getting involved , please do ..
And if you see any of them around , please seize the opportunity to get to know them – it ’s worth it .
P.S. And should you be wondering what my plans are , please do read on .
In this image from NASA TV astronauts John Grunsfeld , left , and Drew Feustel leave the shuttle Atlantis airlock to upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope during a spacewalk , Thursday , May 14 , 2009 .

( AP ) --
A pair of spacewalking astronauts overpowered a stubborn bolt and successfully installed a new piano - sized camera in the Hubble Space Telescope on Thursday , the first step to making the observatory better than ever .
" Let there be light , " spacewalker John Grunsfeld said as ground controllers checked the power hookups .
Grunsfeld and Andrew Feustel also completed other major chores , replacing a science data - handling unit that broke last fall and hooking up a docking ring so a robotic craft can guide Hubble into the Pacific years from now .
The repair job - all the more dangerous because of the high , debris - ridden orbit - got off to a slow and rocky start .
John Grunsfeld and Andrew Feustel had trouble removing the old camera from the telescope because a bolt was stuck .
They fetched extra tools , but none seemed to work .
Finally , Mission Control urged the astronauts to use as much force as possible , even though there was a risk the bolt might break .
If that had happened , the old camera would be stuck inside , leaving no room for its souped - up replacement .
" OK , here we go , " Feustel said .
" I think I 've got it .
It turned .
It definitely turned . "
And then : " Woo - hoo , it 's moving out ! "
The extra effort paid off but put the astronauts a little behind schedule in their first spacewalk of shuttle Atlantis ' mission .
In all , five high - risk spacewalks are planned to fix Hubble 's broken parts and plug in higher - tech science instruments .
Atlantis and its crew are traveling in an especially high orbit , 350 miles above Earth , that is littered with pieces of smashed satellites .
A 4 - inch piece of space junk passed within a couple miles of the shuttle Wednesday night , just hours after the shuttle grabbed Hubble .
Even something that small could cause big damage .
For the first time , another shuttle is on standby in case it needs to rush to the rescue .
Once the sticky bolt was freed , Feustel pulled out the old camera , the size of a baby grand piano .
" This has been in there for 16 years , Drew , " said Grunsfeld , " and it did n't want to come out . "
The spacewalkers followed up with the installation of the replacement camera .
From inside Atlantis , spacewalk overseer Michael Massimino congratulated Grunsfeld and Feustel for " adjusting to the curve ball that was thrown at you . "
The newly inserted wide - field and planetary camera - worth $ 132 million - will allow astronomers to peer deeper into the universe , to within 500 million to 600 million years of creation .
The old one was installed in December 1993 during the first Hubble repair mission , to remedy the telescope 's blurred vision .
It had corrective lenses already in place and , because of the astounding images it captured , quickly became known as the camera that saved Hubble .
It 's also been dubbed the people 's telescope because its cosmic pictures seem to turn up everywhere .
The camera - which has taken more than 135,000 observations - is destined for the Smithsonian Institution .
Massimino was corrected when he said it was awesome to get the new wide - field camera in " to unlock the secrets of the universe . "
" More of the secrets , " responded Grunsfeld , an astrophysicist .
Grunsfeld , the chief repairman with two previous Hubble missions under his work belt , took the lead on the camera and data - handling device replacements .
He sounded awe - struck as ever .
" Ah , this is fantastic , " he said as he floated outside , the bus - size telescope looming overhead .
Hubble 's original data handler , which was launched with the telescope 19 years ago , failed in September , just two weeks before Atlantis was supposed to take off on this fifth and final servicing mission .
The breakdown caused all picture - taking to cease and prompted NASA to postpone the shuttle flight .
Flight controllers managed to get the telescope working again , but NASA decided to replace the faulty computer unit .
The goal is to keep Hubble running for another five to 10 years .
Another two - man team will venture out Friday for the second spacewalk .

Is it simply a temple ?
How could it take its place among other unique structures such as the Pyramid , the Hanging Gardens , and the Colossus of Rhodes ?
For the people who actually visited it , the answer was simple .
It was not just a temple ...
It was the most beautiful structure on earth ...
It was built in honor of the Greek goddess of hunting and wild nature .
That was the Temple of Artemis ( Diana ) at Ephesus .
Location
The ancient city of Ephesus near the modern town of Selcuk , about 50 km south of Izmir ( Smyrna ) in Turkey .
HistoryAlthough the foundation of the temple dates back to the seventh century BC , the structure that earned a spot in the list of Wonders was built around 550 BC .
Referred to as the great marble temple , or temple D , it was sponsored by the Lydian king Croesus and was designed by the Greek architect Chersiphron .
It was decorated with bronze statues sculpted by the most skilled artists of their time : Pheidias , Polycleitus , Kresilas , and Phradmon .
The temple served as both a marketplace and a religious institution .
For years , the sanctuary was visited by merchants , tourists , artisans , and kings who paid homage to the goddess by sharing their profits with her .
Recent archeological excavations at the site revealed gifts from pilgrims including statuettes of Artemis made of gold and ivory ... earrings , bracelets , and necklaces ... artifacts from as far as Persia and India .
On the night of 21 July 356 BC , a man named Herostratus burned the temple to ground in an attempt to immortalize his name .
He did indeed .
Strangely enough , Alexander the Great was born the same night .
The Roman historian Plutarch later wrote that the goddess was " too busy taking care of the birth of Alexander to send help to her threatened temple " .
Over the next two decades , the temple was restored and is labeled " temple E " by archeologists .
And when Alexander the Great conquered Asia Minor , he helped rebuild the destroyed temple .
When St Paul visited Ephesus to preach Christianity in the first century AD , he was confronted by the Artemis ' cult who had no plans to abandon their goddess .
And when the temple was again destroyed by the Goths in AD 262 , the Ephesians vowed to rebuild .
By the fourth century AD , most Ephesians had converted to Christianity and the temple lost its religious glamor .
The final chapter came when in AD 401 the Temple of Artemis was torn down by St John Chrysostom .
Ephesus was later deserted , and only in the late nineteenth century has the site been excavated .
The digging revealed the temple 's foundation and the road to the now swampy site .
Attempts were recently made to rebuilt the temple , but only a few columns have been re-erected .
Description
The foundation of the temple was rectangular in form , similar to most temples at the time .
Unlike other sanctuaries , however , the building was made of marble , with a decorated faзade overlooking a spacious courtyard .
Marble steps surrounding the building platform led to the high terrace which was approximately 80 m ( 260 ft ) by 130 m ( 430 ft ) in plan .
The columns were 20 m ( 60 ft ) high with Ionic capitals and carved circular sides .
There were 127 columns in total , aligned orthogonally over the whole platform area , except for the central cella or house of the goddess .
The temple housed many works of art , including four ancient bronze statues of Amazons sculpted by the finest artists at the time .
When St Paul visited the city , the temple was adorned with golden pillars and silver statuettes , and was decorated with paintings .
There is no evidence that a statue of the goddess herself was placed at the center of the sanctuary , but there is no reason not to believe so .
The early detailed descriptions of the temple helped archeologists reconstruct the building .
Many reconstructions such as that by H.F. von Erlach depicted the faзade with a four - column porch which never existed .
More accurate reconstructions may give us an idea about the general layout of the temple .
However , its true beauty lies in the architectural and artistic details which will forever remain unknown .
Google released a new version of protocol buffers – a language - neutral , platform - neutral , extensible way of serializing structured data for use in communications protocols , data storage , and more .
The changes in this release are outlined in the change notes .
Protocol buffers are a flexible , efficient , automated mechanism for serializing structured data – think XML , but smaller , faster , and simpler .
You define how you want your data to be structured once , then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages .
You can even update your data structure without breaking deployed programs that are compiled against the " old " format .
From to the documents released ;
The commonly available techniques for serializing objects for across processes / machine boundaries are
Native serialization , where objects are serialized using the native implementation of the language being used for e.g.
Java , C ++
Serializing using custom serialization format
Serialize the data to XML .
Each of these approaches have their own set of problems associated with it , for e.g .
Native serialization means the platforms on the ends of the serialization pipe must be the same in order to be able to materialize serialized objects , XML is known to be verbose and an inefficient serialization format and custom serialization formats lead to increased cost of developing one - off parsers .
The goal of Protocol buffers are the flexible , efficient , automated solution to solve exactly this problem .
With protocol buffers , you write a . proto description of the data structure you wish to store .
From that , the protocol buffer compiler creates a class that implements automatic encoding and parsing of the protocol buffer data with an efficient binary format .
The generated class provides getters and setters for the fields that make up a protocol buffer and takes care of the details of reading and writing the protocol buffer as a unit .
Importantly , the protocol buffer format supports the idea of extending the format over time in such a way that the code can still read data encoded with the old format .
Protocol buffers supports the following primitive datatypes that can be represented in " object " graphs
Base 128 Varint representations - int32 , int64 , uint32 , uint64 , sint32 , sint64 , bool , enum ( Varints are a method of serializing integers using one or more bytes .
Smaller numbers take a smaller number of bytes . )
Fixed size 64 bit representations - fixed64 , sfixed64 , double
Fixed size representations - string , bytes , embedded messages , packed repeated fields
Fixed size 32 bit representations - fixed32 , sfixed32 , float
A unit of serialization is a message which could contain fields composed of the primitive datatypes or embedded messages .
Protocol buffers supports optional , required and repeated fields .
An example of an address book message definition using protocol buffers would look like this
package tutorial ; message Person { required string name = 1 ; required int32 id = 2 ; optional string email = 3 ; enum PhoneType { MOBILE = 0 ; HOME = 1 ; WORK = 2 ; } message PhoneNumber { required string number = 1 ; optional PhoneType type = 2 [ default = HOME ] ; } repeated PhoneNumber phone = 4 ; } message AddressBook { repeated Person person = 1 ; }
The features of the message definition language are described in the language guide .
When compiled using a protocol buffer compiler , the encoders and parsers that are generated use a proprietary efficient serialization format .
The current release includes compilers and APIs for C++ , Java , and Python .
However there are community projects to add new language implementations to Protocol Buffers , including Perl , C# , and Ruby .
‘ Mississippi Burning ’ Town Elects Its First African - American Mayor
More than 40 years after the brutal Ku Klux Klan lynching that made it famous , a Mississippi town has elected its first African - American mayor .
In 1964 , the small town of Philadelphia , Miss. , made national headlines for an act of brutal violence that occurred there : members of the Ku Klux Klan murdered three young civil rights activists who had travelled to the town to investigate the burning of a church that supported equal rights for African - Americans .
Though at least 18 Klan members , including a town sheriff , were allegedly involved with planning the murders , only seven were found guilty in the 1967 trial , and none served more than six years in prison .
The FBI investigation received significant attention , and in 1988 , a movie loosely based on the the case , Mississippi Burning , was released .
After years of public and government investigation , another ringleader in the murders , 80 - year - old Edgar Ray Killen , was finally brought to trial in 2005 , and sentenced to 60 years in prison .
More immediately , though , the violent killing brought the civil rights movement to a national platform , and widespread outrage over the incident helped pave the way for the passage of the Civil Rights Act , signed into action that year by President Lyndon Johnson .
The groundbreaking law outlawed racial segregation in schools , employment , and all public places .
Now , more than 40 years later , the town of Philadelphia has made a true transformation : Last Tuesday , James A. Young , a minister and former county supervisor , became the town ’s first African - American mayor .
“ This shows a complete change of attitude and a desire to move forward , ” Young , who was the only black student in his sixth - grade class when the town was de-segregated , told The New York Times .
The town still has a strong white majority , with 56 percent white residents to 40 percent black and 2 percent Native American .
And while Young only took a narrow lead over his white opponent , he believes that the town ’s infamous racism is now firmly in the past .
“ There was no real negativism in this campaign , ” he said .
“ There was no door slammed in my face . ”
“ When I campaigned , the signs on the doors said , ‘ Welcome , ’ and I actually felt welcome . ”
Governor slashes state workers ' pay 5 % STATE'S FISCAL CRISIS
California state employees would lose 5 percent of their pay under the latest proposal by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to help close a widening budget deficit , his spokesman said Thursday .
The plan is expected to be unveiled today as part of $ 3 billion in new cuts that come on the heels of $ 5.5 billion in proposed cuts that were announced Tuesday .
The only state workers who would not face a pay cut are legislators and court workers , who have their own budgets .
California now faces a staggering $ 24.3 billion deficit .
The latest $ 3 billion problem was identified by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst Mac Taylor 's forecast last week .
Thus far , Schwarzenegger has proposed devastating spending cuts that would eliminate popular health care , welfare and college cash grant programs , cause up to 80 percent of state parks to close and result in the release of thousands of inmates from California prisons .
" We have a very challenging time ahead of us , " Schwarzenegger told reporters Thursday afternoon at the Capitol while promoting a $ 56,000 electric Hummer .
The governor did n't detail how he would close the rest of the $ 3 billion deficit , but noted it will be through spending cuts , which he said is very difficult for him .
" There 's not a minute of the day when I do n't think about ... and see the faces of the kind of people that this will affect , " he said before taking the Hummer for a quick test drive .
Schwarzenegger spokesman Aaron McLear said trimming the pay of 235,000 state workers will be a significant part of the governor 's $ 3 billion spending reduction proposal .
The state - worker pay reductions will require the Legislature 's approval and will save the state about $ 885 million .
More than half of that would be used to reduce the deficit .
The rest of the savings would help ease the state 's looming cash shortage .
Without a budget fix , California is on pace to run out of cash by the end of July .
The state has seen an unprecedented cash shortage since the end of last year , resulting in delayed tax refunds and temporarily halting financing of thousands of public works projects .
State workers and their union representatives blasted the governor for continuing to cut state workers ' pay .
In February , the state forced its employees to take two days off a month without pay .
The state also is in the process of eliminating 5,000 jobs .
" He 's just hitting us all over the place , " said Nancy Swindell , president of the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees AFL - CIO Local 2620 that represents 5,000 state health and social services workers .
The furloughs have resulted in reducing state worker pay by more than 9 percent , and the governor 's new pay cut plan would mean a nearly 15 percent pay reduction for state employees .
Yvonne Walker , president of the largest state workers union , Service Employees International Union Local 1000 , said she is simply " pissed . "
" Enough , enough , enough , " said Walker , whose union successfully negotiated a contract with Schwarzenegger only to have the deal stall in the Legislature earlier this year .
State workers already have done their fair share in helping cut state spending , she said .
Amy Li , who works at the Department of Motor Vehicles office on Oak Street in San Francisco , said the additional pay cut will make her daily living more difficult .
" It sounds never ending .
We 're doing our best to survive , " she said .
But California 's fiscal crisis also has been a prolonged struggle .
And despite Schwarzenegger and the Legislature enacting a budget in February that would close an unprecedented $ 42 billion deficit , California continued to be in fiscal free - fall .
On May 14 , five days before voters rejected Schwarzenegger 's budget - related ballot measures , the governor said the state would face an additional $ 21.3 billion deficit , and offered a plan that included deep cuts in education , prisons and health and welfare programs .
The plan also included nearly $ 6 billion in borrowing from Wall Street , an idea that Schwarzenegger has abandoned and has replaced with deeper cuts , including outright elimination of health care programs for nearly 1 million poor children , a welfare program that helps nearly 500,000 single mothers find jobs and phasing out Cal Grants , a popular cash grant program for college students from low - to middle - income families .
Now , the deficit is even deeper , prompting the governor to propose today the new round of $ 3 billion in cuts .
Here 's how on - edge the market and regulators are right now ...
Last night , The Turner Radio Network , a white supremacist outlet run by Hal Turner , published what it claimed was a " leak " of the Treasury stress tests .
They did n't actually publish a document , just a summary and in short they said the stress tests showed the entire banking system was stunningly insolvent .
Zero Hedge says the leak definitely had a negative impact on the market as news of it started to spread -- it 's being discussed heavily on message boards , etc -- so the Treasury was prompted to put out a denial , saying they do n't even have the results yet .
Now just stop right there .
In the past , there would be no way something from a kook outlet like The Turner Radio Network could force a response from Treasury .
Well , welcome to the financial crisis of 2009 .
So is there any chance that it was a legitimate leak ?
We 're skeptical for the obvious reason that we do n't consider the source to be credible .
But beyond that , it just does n't sound right that there 'd be a memo floating around out there detailing the carnage in the way Turner has described it .
The whole thing will be designed and packaged in such a way to show that everyone 's fairly healthy , but that some might need a few billion here or there .
If there were data out there suggesting that the banks were trillions in the whole , we imagine it 's recorded in some obtuse , not - easily decipherable manner .
Mr Sudani ( L ) offered to resign as trade minister on Monday
Iraq 's former trade minister has been arrested at Baghdad airport on corruption charges as he was trying to leave the country .
Officials said Abdul Falah Sudani had been on a flight to the United Arab Emirates which was asked to turn back to Baghdad so he could be arrested .
Mr Sudani resigned as minister earlier this month amid claims officials in his department had embezzled large sums .
He denies wrongdoing .
Investigators had already arrested one of his brothers .
Sabah Mohammed Sudani was held on suspicion of corruption at a checkpoint in the south of the country on 9 May .
Bribery allegations
Abdul Falah Sudani offered to stand down as trade minister over the allegations on 14 May ; his resignation was eventually accepted by Prime Minister Nouri Maliki on Monday following scrutiny of the case by MPs .
Sabah Saedi , head of Iraq 's anti-corruption watchdog , the Commission on Public Integrity , told reporters Mr Sudani had been aboard a flight heading to Dubai when the plane was ordered to bring him back .
Earlier this week , the Commission on Public Integrity said arrest warrants had been issued for some 1,000 allegedly corrupt officials .
Few details were disclosed , but the watchdog said at least 50 were senior figures .
The commission has previously said the most serious complaints concern the trade ministry , where officials allegedly took bribes for contracts .

It is a friendship as remarkable as it is unlikely : Robi Damelin is a 65 - year - old Jewish grandmother whose son , David , served in the Israeli army ; Ali Abu Awwad , 37 , is a former Palestinian revolutionary who joined the first intifada as a teenager and was later sentenced to 10 years in an Israeli prison – he served four .
David Damelin was killed by a Palestinian sniper seven years ago ; two years before that , Awwad 's brother , Youssef , 32 , was shot and killed by an Israeli soldier .
These were two deaths that might have been expected to contribute to the cycle of violence and hatred that characterises the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
Instead , for the past five years Damelin and Awwad have travelled the world , speaking together at mosques , synagogues , parliaments and public meetings to spread the message that there will only be peace in the Middle East when there is reconciliation .
Last week they brought that message to Britain , attending an Amnesty International event and speaking to an audience of Muslims at the London Central Mosque .
In the back of an east London coffee shop , the two reflected on a relationship that both hope may prefigure a different future for Israel and Palestine .
" If someone had said to me when I was 15 that I would have someone like Robi as a friend , " said Awwad , " in my wildest dream I would not have imagined it .
But when I met her she began to tell me about her relationship to her sons and how the killing of David affected her relationship with her other son .
" I felt this very deeply because my mother did n't pay much attention to me after the death of my brother , because she was closer to him than me .
We made a connection . "
That connection was made through the Parents Circle , a remarkable organisation that brings together Israelis and Palestinians who have lost immediate members of their family in the conflict .
The circle , also known as the Bereaved Family Forum , was set up by Yitzhak Frankenthal , an Orthodox Jew whose 19 - year - old son had been killed by Hamas activists .
Today it has more than 500 members who have all rejected violence , hatred or revenge as a means to solve the conflict .
" At first I did n't want to mix with bereaved parents , " admitted Damelin , " but I gradually realised that the only hope for progress was to recognise the face of the conflict – that was why when they told me that David had been killed my first instinct was to say I did not want anyone killed in the name of my child .
I did not want revenge . "
It was through the Parents Circle that she met Awwad , whose brother had been shot in the head .
" When I learned about my brother 's death I was just so full of anger , " he recalled .
" But I realised that for me to survive I needed to meet someone from the other side who could understand me – so when I met Robi I met someone who gave me hope . "
It is a hope which both Damelin and Awwad are keen to stress is not based on pretending there are no disagreements , but is instead rooted in the idea that the first step towards reconciliation is to recognise thesuffering of the other side .
" If you are pro-Palestinian or pro-Israel you are not helping us , " said Damelin .
" You are just feeling good about yourself . "
" For some Muslims , the situation in Palestine is theoretical , " said Awwad .
" Maybe that is why there is more militancy among British Muslims than there is in Palestine , and it's the same with American Jews who seem less likely to compromise than Israelis .
Why ?
Because they are not the ones who have to stand at roadblocks every day , it is n't their children , their sons and brothers who are dying , so it is easy for them to say they do not want to compromise . "
Compromise , Damelin and Awwad believe , is possible ; they are both hopeful for the future .
Damelin – who was born in South Africa – suggested that the Bereaved Families Forum could inspire a future Truth and Reconciliation Commission in Israel and Palestine .
" I remain an optimist , " she said .
" After all , if you had told me in 1967 when I left South Africa that one day whites and blacks would sit together in the same room I would have thought you were mad . "
As mad perhaps as if she had been told that a Palestinian ex-revolutionary would become one of her closest friends .
" It is very difficult to give away things that belong to your child , " she said in a quiet voice .
" It is like admitting that they will not come back .
" But I had this lovely jacket that a relation had brought David – a beautiful jacket – and Ali and David are the same height and build , so I chose to give that jacket to Ali , and I am happy I did .
It was the right thing to have done . "
" Whatever you do , you cannot replace the child a mother has lost , " said Awwad .
" Youssef and David will never come back again , but at least you find something to live for .
Wherever I go I carry a picture of David with me , it 's in my bag with me right now . "
The tea has been drunk and it is almost time to leave .
It must be a strange experience , continually and publicly reopening the wounds of personal loss in the hope that it may eventually inspire peace .
" This is my life , I do n't have a choice any more , " said Damelin , when asked how long she imagined she would continue travelling .
" I have a motherly relationship with Ali .
I worry about him , I care about what happens ; maybe I am a little overprotective about him . "
There is a palpable sense that she and Awwad complete the other in some way , offering some consoling echo of what has been lost .
Theirs is a friendship that only appears unusual when individuals are reduced to labels and tribes ; and yet when Ali Abu Awwad and Robi Damelin are viewed not as Israelis and Palestinians , Jews and Muslims , but rather as a son and mother , the relationship begins not to feel unlikely at all .
" I have found in Robi what I did n't get from my own mother , " said Awwad .
" She knows what kind of clothes I like , the people I like , and she advises me on all these things .
She even knows what food I like . "
" Shrimps , " said Damelin , laughing .
" He is addicted to shrimps . "
DAR ES SALAAM ( Reuters ) -
The world ’s advanced economies are moving too slowly in ridding banks of problem assets , which could jeopardize a global economic recovery in 2010 , the head of the International Monetary Fund said .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn , Managing Director of International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , speaks during a news conference in Kuala Lumpur February 7 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Zainal Abd Halim
The warning by IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss - Kahn comes as the Fund now believes the global economy will be gripped by a “ Great Recession ” in 2009 and contract below zero .
In January the IMF said world growth will come to a virtual standstill this year at 0.5 percent , but Strauss - Kahn said just over a month later the IMF had to cut that forecast following worse - than - expected fourth - quarter data .
Strauss - Kahn said on Wednesday the IMF is still projecting the world economy will recover from mid-2010 but only if governments move quickly to implement stimulus measures and banks ’ balance sheets are cleared of toxic assets .
“ On the ( bank ) restructuring side things are really lagging , ” Strauss - Kahn told Reuters in an interview after an IMF conference on African economies .
“ If it goes that way for two or three more months then recovery in 2010 will be difficult . ”
Extra writedowns and a large U.S. tax fine forced UBS to revise up its 2008 net loss , the biggest in Swiss corporate history , the bank said on Wednesday , after it had earlier received a state subsidy .
And news of an asset insurance scheme in Britain has been coming out piecemeal in the last few days , as the country aims to limit losses banks face on troublesome assets .
The new U.S. administration has outlined a plan to remove toxic assets from banks ’ balance sheets .
“ The U.S. needs to say exactly how they ’re going to do it , ” Strauss - Kahn said .
He said he would take this message to a meeting of Group of 20 finance ministers in Britain on Friday and Saturday .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on February 10 outlined the bank plan , but offered few details on how it would work .
Since then , the Treasury has agreed to a third rescue effort for Citigroup by agreeing to convert preferred shares to common equity , bolstering the bank ’s capital base .
Limiting the losses of banks and insurers on risky assets is widely regarded as the key next step to restoring confidence in the financial system .
MORE STIMULUS
Strauss - Kahn said actions by various governments to stimulate their economies had been more coordinated and responsive although he said “ there is still some room to have some more stimulus . ”
The IMF has proposed that governments that can afford it should act together to roll out a global fiscal stimulus equivalent to about 2 percent of world gross domestic product ( GDP ) or around $ 1.2 trillion .
Currently total fiscal stimulus plans amount to around 1.5 percent of world GDP .
The IMF chief also said he was concerned with the spread of the global crisis to emerging market economies , hit by the sharp drop in demand and prices for commodities and drying up private capital flows .
He said he was concerned large banks and corporations in emerging markets will be unable to rollover maturing debt .
Preliminary estimates by the World Bank this week show that well over $ 1 trillion in emerging market corporate debt and $ 2 - 3 trillion in total emerging market debt mature in 2009 , the majority extended by international banks across borders or through their affiliates in emerging markets .
Most of this lending is in foreign currency , and for relatively short terms , meaning that the currency and maturity risks are primarily on the balance sheet of emerging market banks , companies and households .
With increasing trouble brewing in emerging markets , Strauss - Kahn said it was necessary that IMF shareholder nations agree to double IMF ’s resources by $ 250 billion to $ 500 billion , including the $ 100 billion committed by Japan .
While Strauss - Kahn declined to give the IMF ’s estimates on rollover needs , he said : “ When you look at the figures for 2009 financing needs of emerging countries and what we expect to be covered by rollover ... the gap is huge .
Everyone understands we need to have a sharp increase in our resources . ”
The IMF has already provided $ 50 billion in emergency financing packages to struggling eastern European countries , including Hungary , Latvia , Ukraine , Belarus , Serbia as well as Pakistan and Iceland as the crisis spreads .
Also recently , the IMF projected that 22 developing countries faced a financing gap in 2009 of up to $ 25 billion , which could reach as much as $ 140 billion .

Update , 11:50 a.m. : " Rocky ' ' gets a reprieve , at least temporarily .
DEC officials said today they will not pick up Chris Deverso's 10 - year - old pet snakehead fish today , as originally planned .
" We kind of wanted to do this low key , '' DEC Lt. Don Pleakis said .
" The word of protesters and news crews kind of changed the scenario for us , so we 're going to just pull back and look at all the options .
'' Pleakis said he was n't sure when the DEC would take the fish and kill it .
" Chris still has to give up the fish ; he knows that , '' Pleakis said .
" But for me to go over there today . . . it 's not just a good situation . ''
Pleakis said he understands what Deverso is going through .
" I understand this has been his pet , '' Pleakis said .
" He 's called the senators , he 's called the legislators .
There 's just no wiggle room .
This has gone all the way to the commissioner 's office .
It 's been debated .
It 's a decision we 've got to live with , and a decision Chris has to live with . ''
Pleakis said all the publicity from the case may turn out to be a good thing .
" The word of this case is getting out all over the place , '' he said .
" Maybe somebody reads something and he does find the fish a home .
That 's still not off the table . ''

Clay , NY --
Time has run out for a Clay man 's pet snakehead fish .
The state Department of Environmental Conservation today rejected appeals from the banned fish 's owner to spare the 10 - year - old , 28 - inch - long giant snakehead .
Chris Deverso , the fish 's owner , said DEC officers will pick up the fish today .
" I 've done everything I can possibly do , " he said .
" They 're going to kill my fish . "
Snakeheads have been illegal to own in the United States since 2004 .
Deverso purchased the fish he calls Rocky legally in 1999 , before the ban .
The invasive species , originally from Asia , has a voracious appetite , often consuming all other fish in a lake or pond , and even eating its young .
It can also slither across land , staying out of water for up to three days , to find new sources of food .
Deverso has been trying to convince the state his fish is not a threat to Central New York waterways .
His main argument :
His type of snakehead can't survive in our cold climate .
He 's also found one state , Maryland , that amended its law to allow people to own snakehead like his and others that would die in cold water .
" The DEC says it does n't have the power to give me a permit to keep the fish , " he said .
" A state senator could n't help .
It 's not like I can call ( President ) Obama and ask him to give my fish a pardon . "
DEC Region 7 Capt . Woody Erickson said Wednesday that after reviewing the case , the DEC determined the ban on snakeheads does not distinguish among the different species .
" It 'd be very difficult for the department to distinguish these species of fish and which can and can't be kept , " Erickson said .
" This has risen to the highest levels of the DEC . "
DEC officers are working with the owner to determine a time that 's convenient to pick up the fish .
" We 're sensitive to the situation .
This fish was a pet , " he said .
The fish will be taken to a DEC facility and placed in a walk - in freezer , Erickson said .
The fish 's metabolism will slow and it will die .
The fish will be frozen because the owner wants to consider sending it to a taxidermist , he said .
Deverso earlier this month pleaded guilty in Clay town court to possessing an illegal fish .
He met Tuesday with DEC Region 7 Director Ken Lynch and Erickson .
The meeting was arranged by Sen. John DeFrancisco .
He showed them documents that his fish is a subtropical fish that can't live in cold water .
He also showed them the Maryland law that bans only two of the 29 species of snakeheads -- northern and blotted snakeheads -- because they 're the only two that can survive in cold water .
Deverso has contacted zoos and aquariums , including the Rosamond Gifford Zoo at Burnet Park in Syracuse .
No one local is willing to take the fish .
Now , he 's just waiting for the DEC to take the fish .
" It 's really sad , " Deverso said .
" There 's no reason this fish has to be killed . "

Okay DJs ….. FIGHT !
On the weekends , I deejay at all manner of events .
From cherished weddings , to thumping club gigs , to secret house parties there is a chance that you ’ll probably find me spinning my Pioneers somewhere in the Detroit area at any given Friday or Saturday .
So when DJ Hero was announced , I was extremely happy .
FINALLY a deejay game in the vein of Guitar Hero that will keep me buying plastic junk for my living room .
Then , Scratch : The Ultimate DJ was announced .
Then , Armin Van Buuren – In The Mix was announced .
Suddenly , I ’m worn out of the deejay rhythm - game genre before it even saw the flourescent WalMart light .
I decided to take it upon myself to scope out the three bigger releases in the DJ genre and see which ( if any ) seems like it might be worth my purchase .
In this article , I ’ve compared all 3 games ( with images & video ) to hopefully help you do the same .
No , I have not provided glow sticks .
On with the show !
Armin van Buuren – In The Mix
This is the general dark horse of the genre , so I thought I would place it first in the list .
Developed by Foreign Media Games and using only the WiiMote , the game is exclusive to the Nintendo Wii .
The above concept visuals remind me of trippy audio screen savers from my Windows 95 days .
The flailing of arms to play and create music could be reminiscent of some of the hacked - PC WiiJay videos we ’ve seen in the past .
With van Buuren ’s name behind it I expect to enjoy some great dance , trance , and techno beats .
The game has quite a few modes , including career , quickplay , and a no fail “ party mode ” that lets players free spin .
This could be great for me to bring to gigs and spin freeform for party - goers .
Another interesting mode is the Studio Mode which let ’s players and aspiring deejays create and mix their own tracks using music elements found in the game in a “ paint by numbers ” style of creation , akin to a simplified Acid DJ software package .
No word on if the tracks can be exported to any other formats .
The following concept art also shows off some of the “ crowd ” design as well as the zones of the play screen .
No word on a release date , but expect it to get jumbled up in the Fall with the plethora of other huge releases .
DJ Hero
When DJ Hero was first announced , I thought “ Duh .
It ’s about time ! ” A huge fan of Guitar Hero , a DJ version would be a natural fit .
But , how would the game function ?
What would the controller look like ?
As you can see by the video above ( and the images below ) the DJ Hero turntable controller is about what one would expect .
It includes 3 buttons , a slider , an efx dial , sample buttons , and a scratchable record table for … scratching .
As the track moves left and right on the screen , the player uses the slider in much the same way , throwing in effects and scratches when needed .
The majority of the input takes place with the 3 buttons , however … true to the other Hero games .
Not too much is known about the game modes , but the standard career and free play modes should be there .
The controller has a very nice and solid look to it , and the game could turn out to be quite fun while capturing what I like about Guitar Hero already .
Also announced in a round - about way was that Jay - Z and Eminem will be lending their music in a special pack - in , which includes the turntable , stand , and carrying case .
Highlighted in the game will be one of my favorite producers , DJ Shadow , who ’s having a ball promoting Hero on his own .
The game looks to have music from Dance , Hip Hop , and Rock artists , allowing for some really incredible mixes .
Scratch : The Ultimate DJ
Not much is known about Scratch other than it is being handled by what seems like an endless supply of publishers and developers .
The product looks to be similar to DJ Hero in idea : colors = notes hit on screen , with some movement left to right via slider .
The Numark - developed / branded wheel here is touch - sensitive , and the pads allow players to play & hit samples .
To note , the game allows for the plug - in of a USB microphone for added sample - capturing .
Scratch includes several popular musical acts , from Hip Hop to Pop and beyond , that will allow for more of an underground urban feel .
And Finally …
So there you have it .
The 3 big DJ games ( that we know about ) heading to store shelves this Fall .
Each look to have some unique experiences , using a deck or WiiMote or creating music or sampling .
I can say that DJ Hero is the one I ’m leaning to most as a conventional music rhythm game , but In The Mix could be terrific for actual performances .
Scratch looks to have a “ complete ” package somewhere in the middle .
We ’ll know more at E3 when we can hope to get our hands on a few of these games .
And this time , I WILL bring the glowsticks .

Layton , Utah --
When a Utah mom gave up her son more than 30 years ago she thought she 'd never see him again .
But the two found each other last week thanks to a social - networking site and a typo .
Thirty - two years ago Terri Fuller put her 2 - year - old son up for adoption .
" I was young and barely surviving , " she said .
" I felt he needed a family . "
Terri Fuller
Fuller 's aunt said she knew a couple who could n't have kids .
" I took him to California , Red Bluff .
I walked in the door , and as soon as we did , she took him and took him to his new family , " Fuller explained .
It was a day she never forgot and always regretted .
" There was still that void of not having him there .
I 'd often wanted to look for him , " she said .
For years , Fuller did look .
But her luck changed when she created a profile on MySpace with a note saying she wanted to meet her son .
Rustin Hawver
" I got on the computer .
There was this message .
It says , ‘ Hi , I 'm Rustin Hawver , H - A - W - V - E - R .
I think I 'm the one you 're looking for that you want to meet .
Please let me know if I 'm wrong . '
Because I had it spelled as H - A - V - E - R . "
Her son , who lived hundreds of miles away , actually stumbled upon her page because of a typo .
He missed the " W " in his last name while searching for his blog .
" She had my name misspelled .
If it was n't for Google or that keyboard being messed up , I would have never have found that , " Hawver said .
Hawver , now an adult , could n't be happier .
" It has set my mind at ease , lifted a weight off my heart and allowed me to breathe knowing bits and pieces of who I am is now finally there , " he said .
" [ I ] ca n't wait to see him , put my arms around him and let him know that I never did forget him .
My heart never forgot , " Fuller said .
The two are hoping to get together in March .

FLORENCE , Italy 
From afar , the peloton preparing for a mass sprint looks like a living , breathing creature .
Within the swarm of cyclists , each rider jockeys for position .
Near the end of Stage 13 of the Giro d’Italia on Friday , the riders looked to the left , then to the right .
They checked over their shoulders .
They set their sights ahead of them , and they were off on what was expected to be the final major sprint finish of this three - week race .
Yet the stories that unfold in such fleeting moments tend to live on .
Mark Cavendish , a rider for Team Columbia - Highroad who turned 24 on Thursday , had already won two individual stages of the Giro .
At least twice during the race , he has done what sprinters in any sport are apt to do :
He talked trash to his rivals .
Also in the scrum was Alessandro Petacchi , an Italian sprinter for the LPR Brakes - Farnese Vini team who has been attempting to feud with Tyler Farrar , a Garmin - Slipstream rider .
His latest book , “ Landscaping With Fruit ” ( Storey , 2009 ) , dives into the world of the little - known lingonberry , clove currant , maypop , shipova , hardy kiwi and other fruits that are easy to grow , he says , and as delicious as they are ornamental .
I had come to his garden in New Paltz , N.Y. , one day in May to discover some of them .

Mr. Reich lives on this farmden , as he calls it ( smaller than a farm , bigger than a garden ) , with his wife , Deborah Goldman ; two dogs ; two cats ; a few geese and ducks ; and a flock of chickens that eat the bugs , fertilize the gardens and provide eggs with bright orange yolks that do n’t break in the pan .
On his terrace , which faces west and south , grape and kiwi vines ramble over a pergola , providing leafy shade .
By September , clusters of grapes ( Swenson Red , Brianna and Lorelei ) will dangle overhead , along with smooth kiwifruits the size of large grapes , which taste like pineapple .
Currants abound in Mr. Reich ’s garden .
A red variety called Wilder is trained in a fan shape against a terrace wall ; others  which will be crimson , pink and white  are espaliered along the low wooden fence surrounding the kitchen garden .
A clove currant bush , five feet high and just as wide , is full of yellow trumpet - shaped flowers that smell of clove and vanilla .
By midsummer , it will be covered with satiny little bluish - black berries .
Army Spec. Jeremy
Albert polished a speck off his dress slacks with his thumb , smoothed his olive green coattails and drilled the precise motions with which he would hand off a very hard - won diploma Sunday at Metropolitan State College ’s spring graduation .
The recipient ?
His close friend and trusted counsel and the first member of his family to graduate from college : his mother , accounting major Joyce Brand .
Albert , 22 , who is recovering from a back injury sustained in combat in Iraq , crossed an ocean to surprise Brand , 45 , and tell her on stage before thousands of people how proud she ’s made him .
“ To see her just makes me look at her as a stronger woman , ” Albert said as he prepared for the on -stage moment in a back room at the Denver Convention Center .
“ I hope she does n’t faint . ”
She did n’t .
As the announcer called Albert ’s name under the glaring stage lights , Brand turned to look and broke down in tears .
She managed throughout her surprise to return her son ’s salute and accept her diploma and a special award Albert ’s battalion issued commemorating her achievement .
Albert had told Brand that he could n’t attend .
“ I was kind of sad .
This is a real ly big day for me , ” Brand said .
“ I ’m still kind of shocked .
. . .
This is the best thing that ’s ever happened to me . ”
Brand joined a class of 1,402 graduates ages 20 to 73 , Metro ’s largest spring graduating class ever .
It has n’t been an easy educational road for either Albert or Brand .
Both dropped out of high school .
Brand , raising three children as a single mom , decided 10 years ago that her job with a circuit - board manufacturer “ pushing a button for eight hours a day ” was n’t satisfying .
She wanted a degree .
About the same time , Albert decided to drop out of high school , get his GED and join the Army .
“ I know I was n’t the easiest to take care of , ” he said .
“ But she ’s always been there for me .
She ’s been my therapist . ”
He knows it was difficult for his mom to focus on studies while he fought overseas .
Some nights , Brand said , she would open her books , start thinking of him and break into tears .
In January , Albert ’s unit ran into a homemade explosive device while running reconnaissance for a sniper section in northern Iraq .
The blast threw Albert into the air while his vehicle ’s harness jerked him down , resulting in several ruptured disks in his back .
He joined the Warrior Transition Battalion based in Hawaii to recover .
Albert said he had never thought much about getting a college degree , until now .
“ I did n’t think that I was going to be able to go to college , ” he said .
“ If she can do it , I can do it . ”

Swine flu latest Angela Merkel Germany 's Chancellor : ' Do n't panic at swine flu ! '
Chancellor Angela Merkel has told people in Germany not to panic over the swine flu outbreak , and that precautions are being taken against the virus .
Swine flu outbreak
Three cases confirmed in Germany
The first three cases of swine flu have been confirmed in Germany as the deadly virus outbreak continues to spread across the world .
Swine flu in Mexico Fears of a worldwide pandemic Fears are growing that the deadly swine flu virus - which has killed more than 100 people in Mexico - could become a worldwide pandemic .

Terror internet video Islamists warn of attacks on Germany A chilling terror video has been released on the internet in which Islamist extremists threaten to launch deadly attacks on Germany as a trial gets underway .
According to police sources , a technician from the National Centre for Influenza in Geneva was travelling to Zurich carrying eight glass containers , five of which held the swine flu virus .
The containers holding the virus were commissioned by the Federal Office of Public Health for the Geneva Centre in order to develop a test to detect swine flu .
The vessels were , according to reports , securely packaged three times and hermetically sealed and cooled with dry ice .
The packaging of dry ice , however , was clearly not done properly , as pressure built up in the container during the journey .
At 6.39 pm , shortly before the train arrived at Freiburg ( Fribourg ) station , there was an explosion .
One passenger suffered slight injuries .
The technician gathered up parts of the container and warned the conductor .
The police stopped the train just before Lusanne train station to attend to the 61 passengers in the carriage .
Then came the all clear .
According to police it the containers were transporting the non-deadly strain of the virus , not the same as the strain that has killed more than 100 people in Mexico .
The virologist from Geneva , from whose laboratory the tank came , arrived at the scene and insisted that there was no risk to humans .
The virus , that originated in Mexico , is spreading fast .
Swine flu arrived in Europe yesterday .
A man in Spain ( 23 ) and two British people have been found to be infected .
However , it has been confirmed that two sick patients in Germany are not suffering from swine flu .
Yesterday evening the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) raised the alert level from three to four , meaning that there is an “ increased risk ” of a world wide pandemic of the virus .

Lawmakers and anti-choice advocates threaten to cut off funding from Planned Parenthood all the time .
If you ’re disgraced Louisiana Sen .
David Vitter , for example , you introduce a one - page amendment to the omnibus appropriations bill to deny Title X family planning funding to the agency .
If you ’re Tony Perkins , you call funding for basic women ’s health care services an " abortion industry bailout " and call for a ban on funds to Planned Parenthood .
Your talking points do n’t mention that you do n’t want to fund preventive care services at a provider that offers only legal medical services , and that you ’d like to defund that provider based on personal whims .
Usually , these threats do n’t come into fruition .
Now , Orange County legislators have followed through .
They ’ve cut a nearly $ 300,000 grant to Planned Parenthood to do health education and outreach .
" I personally have a problem with government funding of an organization
that provides abortion services , " said Supervisor John Moorlach , who
placed the item on the agenda , said to the LA Times .
The county money going to Planned Parenthood did n’t fund abortions .
And just a few days ago , the fact that it did was n’t the reason for Supervisor Moorlach ’s objection .
" We have a problem with financing
Planned Parenthood , period , " Mario Mainero , Moorlach ’s chief of staff , told the Orange County Register .
" We just do n’t think government money should be used to talk to teens
and preteens about birth control and abortion . "
So , it was the very services the grant funded that Moorlach has a problem with : he does n’t want teens to hear about contraception .

The latest version of U.S. Tomahawk ( BGM - 109 Block 4 ) missile , is getting upgraded so that it can hit moving targets .
This is mainly intended to turn the Tomahawk into an anti-ship missile , although it can also hit moving land targets .
Currently , the Block 4 costs about $ 1.7 million each , weighs 1.4 tons , has a range of 1,500 kilometers and carries a half ton warhead .
It moves to its target at a speed of 880 kilometers an hour .
Since production began four years ago , 1,300 have been made since .
The Tomahawk was introduced 26 years ago , and over 6,000 have been manufactured .
The U.S. Navy has fired over 1,900 in combat and training .
The United States is developing a successor to the Tomahawk cruise missile , that will be heavier ( 2.2 tons , versus 1.4 tons ) , have a longer range ( 2,000 kilometers versus 1,500 ) and a one ton warhead ( twice the size of the Tomahawks . )
The new missile will be stealthier , and use a combination of guidance and targeting systems ( to improve the chances of success ) .
Price will probably be the key factor in whether this new missile ever enters service .
The new Cruise Missile XR ( for Extended Range ) will probably cost twice that , or more .
The cruise missile , when it showed up in the 1980s , was one of the first UAVs , it just was n't reusable .
But UAVs that carry bombs and missiles , and can be reused , are going to provide competition for a new , $ 3 million , Cruise Missile XR .

May 20 , 2009 Biofuels continue to steal the spotlight when it comes to the search for a renewable , environmentally friendly replacement for crude oil .
While that ’s understandable when considering the transport industry , but crude oil is also used in the production of conventional plastics and chemical products such as fertilizers and solvents .
Now chemists have learned how to convert plant biomass directly into a chemical building block that can not only be used to produce fuel , but also plastics , polyester and industrial chemicals cheaply and efficiently .
Earlier work by researchers at the Department of Energy 's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory ( PNNL ) saw the development of a process to convert glucose and fructose derived from cellulose , into a primary building block for fuel and polyesters known as hydroxymethylfurfural , or HMF .
Although it is a fairly simple process to convert HMF into plastics or biofuel , it is seldom used because HMF is costly to make .
Other researchers had previously converted fructose into HMF , but the PNNL research group made a series of improvements that raised the HMF output , and also made the HMF easier to extract .
Using a chemical and solvent known as an ionic liquid , the PNNL team was able to convert the simple sugars into HMF .
The chemical , a metal chloride known as chromium chloride , converted sugar into highly pure HMF , but the team still needed to break down cellulose into simple sugars – a step they wanted to skip .
By trying different metal chloride catalysts in the ionic solvent to speed up the conversion of cellulose to HMF , the team has now managed to convert cellulose directly into HMF in one step .
They found that a combination of copper chloride and chromium chloride under 120 degrees Celsius broke down the cellulose without creating a lot of unwanted byproducts and allowed them to bypass the sugar - forming step .
According to the researchers the simplified process generates a high yield of HMF and allows the use of raw cellulose as feed material .
In additional experiments , the team tested how well their method compared to acid , a common way to break down cellulose .
The metal chlorides - ionic liquid system worked ten times faster than the acid and at much lower temperatures .
Optimizing their method , the team found that they could consistently achieve a high yield of HMF .
The team ’s method converted about 57 percent of the sugar content in the cellulose feedstock to HMF through this single step process .
The team recovered more than 90 % of the HMF formed , and the final product from the process was 96 % pure .
In addition , the metal chlorides and ionic liquid could be reused multiple times without losing their effectiveness , thereby lowering the cost of HMF production by being able to recycle the materials .
The new process means that it may soon be viable to harness the energy from carbon dioxide and solar energy that crop plants pick up , instead of relying on the ancient solar energy locked up in fossil fuels .
The single step process developed by the PNNL team is detailed in a paper available at ScienceDirect .

ISPs could soon be asked to monitor the online activities of their users Persistent illegal file - sharers should be cut off from the net , an alliance of UK creative industries will tell the government later .
The alliance wants the government to force internet service providers ( ISPs ) to disconnect users who ignore repeated warnings about sharing illegal content .
John Woodward , head of the UK Film Council , said illegal file - sharing was hurting film - making and risking jobs .
The coalition says more than 50 % of net traffic in the UK is illegal content .
Mr Woodward said : " The growing threat of illegal P2P ( peer to peer ) file - sharing threatens [ the creative industries ] , as films go unmade , DVD sales deteriorate and jobs are lost in production and distribution of content . "
Without question , piracy threatens jobs , but have the creative industries been a bit loose with their maths and language in order to strike an emotive point ?
Darren Waters ' blog
Nine creative bodies and five trade unions have signed a joint statement asking the government to force ISPs into banning users caught sharing illegally .
It marks a significant hardening of their stance on the role of ISPs , which in the past has focused on education and awareness .
The creative industries , including the British Phonographic Industry and the Federation Against Copyright
Theft , have issued a set of " urgent recommendations " that they want to be included in the government 's Digital Britain manifesto .
They argue that many jobs in the 800,000 - strong sectors of film , TV , music , and software are threatened by illegal file - sharing .
However , the Internet Services Providers ' Association ( Ispa ) - a trade body that represents ISP's - said that users could challenge disconnections through the courts and , at present , the technology available for monitoring and detecting illegal sharers was not of a standard " where they would be admissible as evidence in court " .
Instead , Ispa said that rights holders needed to rewrite their licensing agreements , to take account of " new models of online content distribution " .
In a statement , Ispa 's secretary general , Nicholas Lansman , said : " Ispa recognises that there is a problem with unlawful P2P file sharing , but it is important to recognise that a major part of the solution lies in licensing reform and the availability of legal content online . "
Last year , the UK government told ISPs to take concrete steps to curb illegal downloads or face legal sanctions , but shied away from legislation that would force ISPs to ban repeat offenders .
No-one from the Internet Service Providers Association was available for comment on the alliance 's statement .
Content gatekeepers Earlier this year , the UK's Intellectual Property minister , David Lammy , said : " We can't have a system where we 're talking about arresting teenagers in their bedrooms . "
The government has set a target of reducing illegal file - sharing by 70 to 80 % within two to three years .
ISPs have long resisted becoming " gatekeepers of content " and have pointed out that any change to their role would require a change in UK legislation , which currently classifies them as mere " conduits " of data .
More than a billion songs were shared illegally online in 2007
Last year , some of the UK 's biggest internet providers signed up to a voluntary scheme that saw letters sent out to thousands of users suspected of illegally sharing music .
The European Union has also signalled its interest in the debate , with MEPs saying users need to have better protection from being disconnected .
MEPs stressed the need for a ruling from a court before a user 's connection was cut .
The alliance warned that illegal file - sharing could have a devastating impact on creativity and the British economy , if it goes unchecked .
Secure delivery
In an " unprecedented joint statement " , the alliance predicted a " lawless free - for - all " unless the government ensured the " safe and secure delivery of legal content " .
It reports that in 2007 an estimated 98 million illegal downloads of films and more than a billion illegal downloads of music tracks took place in the UK .
It says more than six million people in the country regularly file - share copyright content without permission .
The previous tactic of pursuing individual file - sharers in the courts appear to have been abandoned .
" Suggestions for rights - owners to take many thousands of legal actions seeking damages against individual file - sharers in court are neither practicable nor proportionate and would create a drain on public resources , " the joint statement reads .
The statement stops short of calling on the government to introduce legislation with detailed technical measures to prevent illegal file - sharing .
" Instead , [ the government ] should provide enabling legislation , for the specific measures to be identified and implemented in an Industry Code of Practice , " it recommends .

Vets found about 30 pieces of plastic inside Jack during surgery
A puppy had to have emergency surgery after eating an entire alphabet of fridge magnets .
Six - month old Jack had just returned home from a castration operation on Thursday when he swallowed the magnets .
The yellow labrador was taken to the PDSA 's charity hospital in Plymouth , Devon , by his owner the next morning , where he was immediately operated on .
Owner Emma Keers says she will not buy any more magnets - and has banished Jack to sleep away from the fridge .
She said : " Jack was sleepy after the ( castration ) anaesthetic so I put him in the kitchen to recover overnight .
" The next morning I noticed the whole alphabet was missing from the fridge , though Jack was n't showing any signs of being ill .
" He can be quite greedy though . "
Jack had to have emergency surgery one day after his castration operation
Vet Robert Newcombe said about 30 pieces of chewed plastic were found in Jack .
" We had to operate straight away with both a gastrotomy , where we opened up his tummy , and an enterotomy , to remove more pieces of fridge magnets that had made their way to his intestine .
" The letters were well chewed and not easy to identify . "

The latest report uncovered a series of bright spots for an academic discipline that underwent a midlife crisis after the dot - com collapse beginning in 2000 .
After a wave of students came to the discipline during the Internet boom , there was an equivalent decline during the past eight years as the nation ’s college students decided en masse that the future lay in fields like investment banking and financial engineering .
The Taulbee Survey , with data tables covering different time periods , also found that the number of new undergraduate majors in computer science increased 9.5 percent and that the rate of decline in new bachelor ’s degrees improved to 10 percent , from 20 percent in the previous report .
Total Ph.D. production grew to 1,877 for the period July 2007 to June 2008 , a 5.7 percent increase over the previous period .
“ The most compelling story for our community is that interest in computer science appears to have turned the corner , ” said Peter Harsha , director of government affairs at the Computing Research Association , an organization representing 200 North American academic departments of computer science , computer engineering and related fields ; 26 industrial research labs ; and 6 affiliated professional societies .
“ We think this bodes well for efforts to change the perception about careers in computing . ”
In recent years the computer science community has done a good deal of hand - wringing over fears that students increasingly saw the field as one of drudge work involving sitting at computer monitors and writing endless lines of code .
Now , say Mr. Harsha and others who are following student interests , there is a sense that computing science skills are increasingly being seen as a toolkit for pursuing a number of modern careers .
“ We ’re seeing amazing increases in enrollment , ” said Eric Roberts , a computer scientist at Stanford University .
“ It ’s not that people have forgotten about the offshoring of jobs , but our competition is n’t what it was .
There are fewer places to go , and we do n’t have Lehman Brothers , Bear Sterns and Citibank to compete with . ”

Leave it to Lars von Trier to spoil a perfectly pleasant Sunday evening at Cannes with graphically depicted sexual mutilation .
The director ’s Antichrist — starring Charlotte Gainsbourg and Willem Dafoe as a husband and wife grieving the death of their young son — made its debut at the film festival yesterday , earning loud boos and baffled reviews .
Why ?
The movie features graphic sex and a talking fox , but most controversial , apparently , are a pair of vivid scenes in which Gainsbourg ’s character , who ’s off her meds , commits acts of unprintable violence on the couples ’ genitals ( raves Variety : “ [ she ] finds a way to impale him that Hollywood ’s leading torture - porn experts will kick themselves over not having dreamed up first ” ) .
So what does she do , exactly ?
Read on only if you want to skip lunch and cross your legs for the rest of the day !
We suppose the following could technically be considered a spoiler , though we can’t imagine anyone would want to be taken by surprise by something like this in a movie theater .
Are you sure you actually want to read this ?
Really ?
Really ??
Okay !
So far , no review has gone into gruesome details , though , from what we gather , here ’s how it goes down , more or less :
After knocking him unconscious , Gainsbourg bores a hole in Dafoe ’s leg with a hand drill and bolts him to a grindstone to keep him from escaping .
Then , she smashes his scrotum with some sort of blunt object ( the moment of impact happens slightly below the frame ) .
We do n’t actually see his testicles become disengaged from this body , though it ’s apparently implied .
Next , she brings him to a climax with her hands and he ejaculates blood ( yes , it ’s shown ) .
But that ’s not all !
Later , in an extreme closeup — lensed by Oscar - winning Slumdog Millionaire cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle ! —
Gainsbourg cuts off her own clitoris with a pair of scissors .
So , as you might ’ve guessed , Antichrist is one of those love - it - or - hate - it movies .
Roger Ebert calls it “ the most despairing film I ’ve ever have seen . ”
Jeffrey Wells brands it a “ fartbomb . ”
Movieline ’s David Bourgeois says it ’s “ the most original and thought - provoking work von Trier has done since Breaking the Waves . ”
Variety ’s Todd McCarthy , who must ’ve been seated in the same row as Wells , says the movie “ cuts a big fat art - film fart . ”
Our favorite reaction , though , is from the Times ’s Manohla “ Movie Killer ” Dargis , who Ebert says he heard singing “ That ’s Entertainment ! ” as she left the theater .

If societies express their values through the laws they make , one single legal change would completely transform our understanding of the ­relationship between nature and humankind : giving nature rights .
And that change would be our best weapon in fighting climate change because it would give nature a voice on how we regulate the earth .
The idea of " wild law " has been around since the 1960s , when writers questioned whether trees should have standing .
But now enacting those ideas is a matter of our survival on this planet .
Laws that recognise the world as a legal person with rights and remedies that can be enforced nationally and internationally would create a duty of care towards the environment .
It is strange that we have a duty of care towards our " neighbour " , but that in law nature is not considered our neighbour .
If we value the natural world we need for life , we can prove it by giving it and its components – rivers , forests , species , habitats , ecosystems – sufficient standing in law to enable proceedings to be brought on their behalf .
Our legal system already does this for " non-­persons " such as companies , charities , clubs and others .
Give the sea rights , and overfishing would not be a matter of quotas set by governments but of balancing the rights of fish and humans .
If the atmosphere could be a legal entity , its representative would have a say in carbon trading .
A river with a right to flow continually being harmed by damming would require the courts to intervene in deciding whether the human need is greater than that of the river to subsist .
This is not as far fetched as it sounds .
It is entirely consistent with the 1982 UN World Charter for Nature , ratified by more than 150 UN members but lacking enforcement mechanisms to give it real teeth .
It is the logical outcome of its 2002 successor , the Earth Charter .
Practically , how do we do this ?
Our courts could expand the definition of who our neighbour is to include nature and thus create a legal duty of care toward the earth .
At EU level we then pass a declaration of nature 's rights , which would , like the declaration of human rights , be implemented by each of the member states in an Earth Rights Act like our Human Rights Act .
This would be enforced by our national courts and influence the regulators ' decision - making .
Internationally , we need to refocus what is contained in the World Charter for Nature , which sets out " human duties towards the earth " , and create " earth rights " .
Any declaration needs to be coupled with giving enforcement powers to our international institutions , otherwise the declaration will create positive debate but not be effective .
Language is a powerful tool , and we want to stop talking about the planet as a " resource " .
There has to be a better understanding of how humans affect the planet – so teach people where their plastic water bottle ends up and where their food comes from .
We can also redefine the " public interest " to include the interest of nature .
Some would argue granting rights is only part of the solution , but it will cause the shift in thinking we require to decarbonise our society .
As Wangari Maathai , winner of the 2004 Nobel peace prize , said : " The need to forge a new and healthier relationship between the human race and the planet that sustains us could not be more urgent . "
Let 's not be known as the " age of stupid " but as the age that walked on the wild side of the law and brought radical change to the way we think about law and about nature to stave off the perfect storm .
Ever wonder what the path of a Roomba looks like as it cleans your house ?
It 's an amazing combination of randomness and precision , as shown by this long - exposure shot .

The shot was taken by shutting off all the lights in the room for 30 minutes and taking a long exposure of the path the Roomba took while cleaning up .
It 's beautiful and surprising .
I always assumed it worked with using some sort of grid , but that clearly is n't the case at all .

If China sneezes does the world catch a cold ?
What ever way we look at it , China continues to expand , this is in stark contrast with recessions being experienced around the world , but , at what cost ?
Despite the country not fully implementing existing stimulus measures , real - GDP growth fell to +6.1 % , y/y in the 1st Q from +6.8 % in 4th Q , the lowest growth rate on record .
External demand is waning , only natural .
However , China has to improve domestic consumption to sustain growth .
With millions of migrant laborers and students unemployed , the fear of social unrest continues .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a fine balancing act that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s required for the worldÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s 3rd - largest economy .
Are they up to the task before its all breaks ?
The US $ is stronger in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is higher against 13 of the 16 most actively traded currencies , in a Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
It looks like inflation is dead in the water after this weeks US data .
CPI headline fell - 0.4 % last month from a year ago ( thatÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s the first decline in 54 - years ) , as both food and energy prices fell on the month while consumer weakness continues to reduce businesses ’ pricing power .
However , core - prices unexpectedly climbed + 1.8 % y/y. Medical , education and tobacco , attributed for most of the increase .
Surprisingly energy prices fell - 3.0 % , m / m , erasing all of Feb. Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s gains .
Digging deeper , one notices that home fuel oil prices declined - 7.7 % , m/ m , gas and electricity was down - 1.4 % .
The real eye open was gas and motor fuel which fell - 4.4 % , m/ m , despite higher monthly oil prices .
Not unexpected , house prices declined - 0.1 % in March .
New vehicle prices advanced +0.6 % m/m , the 3rd- consecutive monthly gain .
As analysts point out itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s in sharp contrast to the Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœusedÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ vehicle market where prices have fallen for the last year !
Not so bleak was the Empire State Manufacturing Index which showed that conditions in the district have improved considerably more than expected .
This monthÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s print of - 14.65 , despite a contracting signal , was at a less rapid pace than last monthÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s record print of - 38 .
The optimistic view being spinned by analysts is that the region sample of overall US manufacturing conditions .
The biggies being the Philly Fed and ISM will be the ones to adhere - to .
Finally , the capacity utilization rate declined more than expected to 69.3 % ( which is the lowest on record ) .
Last monthÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s print was a 1 - point drop from Feb. Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s revised print ( 79.3 % ) .
Despite any signs of recovery over the medium term , the enormous amount of spare capacity should keep pricing power under pressure across the board .
Consumers will not and cannot absorb increases at this time .
Digging deeper , one notices that motor vehicle production jumped + 1.5 % , m/m , but ex-motor and parts , production plunged - 1.9 % m/ m ( the 5th - consecutive monthly decline ) .
The USD $ currently is higher against the EUR - 0.36 % , GBP - 0.44 % , GBP - 0.28 % , CHF - 0.33 % and lower against JPY + 0.66 % .
The commodity currencies are weaker this morning , CAD - 0.29 % and AUD - 0.87 % .
The loonie managed to print its highest levels in 3 - months yesterday , amid signs that the global slowdown may be moderating and the belief by some traders that the quantitative easing that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s expected to take place next week under Governor Carney has already being priced in .
Expect China t reverse some of thoughts .
The loonie seems to be getting ahead of itself , definitely the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœdonkey before the cartÃ¢â‚¬â „¢ , combined with option - related activity and the ability of the TSX to resist the downward pull of US equities contributed to the currencies gains thus far this week .
Technical analysts believe that if the currency could penetrate the 1.2020 - 50 support levels , it opens the door for a 1.1875 print .
This may be a tad optimistic ahead of next weekÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s monetary policy meeting ( 21st April ) .
It seems to be a foregone conclusion that Governor Carney at the BOC will Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœflood banks with cash to halt the hoarding of capital and expand lending Ã¢â‚¬â „¢ .
A quantitative easing method has seen currencies depreciate significantly when their governments started the program ( BOE , BOJ , and Fed ) .
However , its painful not to go with the hard !
The AUD continued its slide from its 6 - month highÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s for a 3rd - day on the back of China saying its economy expanded at the slowest pace in almost 10 - years ( +6.1 % vs. +6.8 % ) , thus raising concerns that the global recession will deepen and investors will avoid the riskier assets .
For now , look for traders to continue to sell on upticks ( 0.7187 ) .
Crude is higher in the O/N session ( $ 50.02 up +77 c ) .
Oil pared its earlier gains in yesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s session after the weekly EIA reported that inventory levels had climbed once again to a new 19 - year high .
Crude stocks rose + 5.67 m barrels to +366.7 m vs. an expected + 1.76 m , the highest levels since Sept. 1990 .
More importantly , demand destruction remains an issue with total daily demand averaging +187 m barrels over the past 4 - weeks , that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s down – 5.2 % , y/y .
Gas inventories declined - 944 k barrels to +216.5 m , while distillate fuels ( includes heating oil and diesel ) , fell - 1.17 m barrels to +139.6 m .
Refineries are operating at + 80.4 % of capacity , down - 1.5 % , w/w , and the lowest level in 7 - months .
The fundamental data is abysmal , this is once again an extremely bearish report supported by demand destruction , that being said the black stuff is trading inter - day focusing on equities , USD and inflation .
Sooner or later , the market will wake up and rely on the fundamentals .
OPEC for an 8th - consecutative month cut its forecast for oil demand this year ; they lowered by - 430 k barrels a day to +84.18 m .
They expect demand in industrialized countries to fall even further this year , while developing economies are likely to see only minor growthÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
They next meet on May 28th to review production quotas .
Crude had started the week under pressure after an IEA report for this year shows that total global demand may fall to its lowest level in 5 - years .
This is very much in line with OPECÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s views .
They expect consumption to fall - 2.4 m barrels a day to +83.4 m , that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a decline of +2.8 % as worldwide GDP falls by - 1.4 % .
Until we see inventories decline substantially and sustainable demand destruction , there will not be a sustainable price gain .
Gold is little changed despite US inflation reports being somewhat being benign .
With the threat of the IMF needing to offload 3500 + tons of the yellow metal , expect the market to sell on upticks ( $ 892 ) .
The Nikkei closed 8,755 up +77 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 4,548 up +1 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 3,990 up + 22 .
The 10 - year TreasuryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s backed up 3 bp yesterday ( 2.80 % ) and are little changed in the O/N session .
Treasuries remain better bid on pull backs as the Fed purchased $ 10.3 b off - the - run US issues as part of its program to keep borrowing costs low ( to date just under $ 55 b buy - backs in 3 - weeks ) .
Weaker fundamental data combined with continuous buy - backs ( todayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s long dated TIPS ) will in effect keep treasuries better bid at the moment .
Expect traders to make the government pay up for off - the - run issues .
With no Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœprices pressureÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ evident in this weeks US data , the Yield curve should flatten .

Republican Congressperson accuses Al Gore of making windfall profits on cap - and - trade regulations
Looks like those evil oil companies are n’t the only ones making windfall profits these days .
Republican Congressman Congresswoman Congressperson Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee finally did what we ’ve been waiting for – she confronted Al Gore about the vast fortune he expects to make from Cap - and - Trade legislation to supposedly fight climate change .
Gore tap dances .
Gore acts shocked .
Gore acts insulted .
Gore shucks and jives .
Hey , there ’s an idea .
Maybe they should be honest here and change the name from Cap - and - Trade to Shuck - and - Jive .

Miss California Carrie Prejean retains her crown
Donald Trump , owner of the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants has reviewed the alleged racy shots of Carrie Prejean to determine if they are grounds for her to lose that Miss California USA crown .
Trump announced today in a conference at the Trump Towers in New York that Carrie will retain her crown as Miss California 2009 and will be on the next pageant to pass on the title .
Carrie spoke at the conference and said that the first leaked photo was taken by his girlfriend when she was 17 years old to add to her modeling portfolio .
“ The photo is intended for application and not for publication ” , she also said that the 2nd photo was photoshopped .
Regarding the latest set of photos that hit the web : Carrie said those were professionally taken from a magazine photo shoot about 2 years ago and the photographer violated her trust for releasing those pictures .
A zombie movie filmed in Tooting on a budget of just £ 45 has turned out to be a hit at the Cannes Film Festival .
Colin , directed by amateur film - maker Marc Price , was made using a crowbar , some tapes and volunteer actors found on Facebook , the social networking site .
The film , which was screened alongside movies by Quentin Tarantino and Ang Lee , drew huge audiences at the international film festival last week and two Japanese companies have already made bids to distribute it .
Mr Price told The Times newspaper : “ We wanted to focus on story and character , and rely on that to hook the audience .
“ Cast - wise we had over 100 people and I ’m still not quite sure how that happened .
Lots of them were just like , ‘ Hey , I ’d love to be a zombie ’ , so we said , ‘ If you want to be a human too , bring a weapon of your choice . ”
The 30 - year - old , who comes from Swansea and has no formal training in film - making , said he picked up most of his skills from DVD extras , such as directors ’ commentaries .
Colin was shot on a camcorder in Swansea and Tooting over 18 months using actors and make - up artists who donated their services for free .
The film - makers aimed at an unusual twist on the zombie genre , telling the story from the point of view of the zombie .
Mr Price said : “ The ultimate goal was rather than going for screams , we wanted to try to move the audience , to try to get them to cry , get a real emotional response from them .
“ We wanted to try to avoid what other films had done , which is why we began doing it from the zombie ’s perspective . ”
The 97 - minute movie was shown at the Marche des Films - the vast conference centre attached to the main festival hall , where film - makers vie for attention .
Mr Price , who works for a courier firm in London , is already planning his next endeavour - a World War II film involving a limpet - like monster .
This time the budget may even stretch to £ 100 .

Enlarge By Eric Risberg , AP Facebook , founded by Mark Zuckerberg , above , has been used by cybercrooks to spread viruses .
Cybercriminals have launched a massive new wave of Internet - based schemes to steal personal data and carry out financial scams in an effort to take advantage of the fear and confusion created by tumbling financial markets , security specialists say .
The schemes — often involving online promotions touting fake computer virus protection , get - rich scams and funny or lurid videos — already were rising last fall when financial markets took a dive .
With consumers around the world panicking , the number of scams on the Web soared .
The number of malicious programs circulating on the Internet tripled to more than 31,000 a day in mid-September , coinciding with the sudden collapse of the U.S. financial sector , according to Panda Security , an Internet security firm .
It was n't a coincidence , says Ryan Sherstobitoff , chief corporate evangelist at Panda .
" The criminal economy is closely interrelated with our own economy , " he says .
" Criminal organizations closely watch market performance and adapt as needed to ensure maximum profit . "
Among those caught in the most recent barrage of scams was Justin Terrazas , 27 , a beverage merchandiser from Seattle .
He clicked on a Web link that infected his MacBook Pro laptop with a data - stealing program .
Not realizing the laptop was compromised , Terrazas later typed his Bank of America debit card number and PIN to pay his Verizon cellphone bill online .
The data - stealer swiftly siphoned his information .
A few days later , someone used Terrazas ' debit card account to make a $ 501.41 online purchase from Modabrand.com , a designer clothing store .
The merchandise was shipped to London , leaving Terrazas to unravel a big mess .
" This is definitely something you do n't need in your life , " he says .
The boom in cyberthreats that occurred during the last three months of 2008 could accelerate , especially if the economy continues to falter , security specialists say .
Organized cybercrime groups have become increasingly efficient at assembling massive networks of infected computers , called botnets , and deploying them to amass large caches of stolen data , according to several surveys and dozens of interviews with security and privacy analysts .
Meanwhile , scammers have honed the trickery used to turn stolen data into cash .
" There is a well - funded , well - educated horde continually probing for cracks and finding their way in " to consumers ' financial information , says Roger Thornton , chief technology officer of security firm Fortify Software .
" They are breaching … the highest levels of the global finance infrastructure and a majority of our home computers . "
Last fall , virulent programs called Trojans began to circulate more widely in e-mail and instant - message spam , got embedded in tens of thousands popular Web pages and spread in a widening barrage of online ads .
Click on the wrong thing , and you would download an invisible Trojan crafted to steal sensitive data and allow the attacker to control your computer .
All types of con games — from e-mail phishing scams , which try to trick you into typing sensitive data at fake websites , to cyberhijacking , in which crooks use stolen user names and passwords to pilfer online accounts — increased , according to security firms , government regulators and law enforcement officials .
Targeting data storehouses Hackers also are intensifying attacks on data storehouses .
Last week , Heartland Payment Systems disclosed that intruders cracked into the system it uses to process 100 million payment card transactions a month .
And Tuesday , Monster.com announced it would impose a mandatory password change for all North American and Western European users of its popular employment website .
Thieves recently broke into Monster 's databases to steal user IDs , passwords and other data that could be useful in a variety of scams .
" There are limitless opportunities in data of this quality , " says Robert Sandilands , anti-virus director at the security firm Authentium .
To cybergangs , the implosion of the financial markets and widespread job cuts have translated into more opportunities .
Not long after banking giant Wachovia failed , phishing e-mail began circulating asking current and former customers to type in personal information to a website to complete mandatory installation of a new Internet security certificate .
The website was a counterfeit , and some users who fell for the scam had their computers infected with the Gozi Trojan , which funnels stolen data to a computer server equipped to instantly sell the data to other criminals , according to the security firm SecureWorks .
Some thieves have stuck to the path of least resistance , snaring account user names , passwords and Social Security numbers .
Cybercrime groups have gone further , sending tainted links in e-mail and instant messages , and spreading viruses via the direct messaging systems used on the social - networking websites Facebook , MySpace and Twitter .
Facebook encourages users to report any suspicious messages , but there 's only so much it — and the other networking sites — can do to stop cybercriminals .
" We 'll investigate and take appropriate action , which may include disabling the sender 's account and blocking certain links from being posted , " says Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt .
But cybergangs now routinely activate hundreds of accounts by the minute , dedicating them to criminal pursuits .
Tainted links also are increasingly turning up in routine search queries on Google , Yahoo search and Windows Live search .
The search companies also say they can do little to stem the rising tide of cybercrime .
Google spokesman Jay Nancarrow says only that the search giant has " strict policies " against fraudulent practices , which it takes pains to enforce .
The FBI and Secret Service have created partnerships with police agencies around the world to combat cybercrimes .
U.S. agents have been able to infiltrate several organized crime groups to make dozens of arrests , says Shawn Henry , assistant director of the FBI Cyber Division .
Even so , " The offense tends to outpace the defense , " Henry says .
" The cyberthieves are extremely creative . "
The threat from insiders Some cybercriminals have begun to spread malicious programs by corrupting online banner ads .
Security firm Finjan reports that new tools being sold on criminal forums can be used to infect online ads that use Adobe 's popular Flash player .
The wide availability of such tools — and the fact that thousands of tech - savvy workers are being laid off in today 's economy — is raising concerns that some of the jobless might see cybercrime as a way to survive .
" Unemployed IT personnel potentially can find easy income by purchasing and using crimeware , " says Finjan CTO Yuval Ben-Itzhak .
" We expect a rising number of people will try . "
Some novice cybercrooks wo n't need anything fancier than a Web browser to get rolling .
M. Eric Johnson , director of the Center for Digital Strategies at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College , recently tried typing simple search queries , such as " insurance record , " in Google and on file - sharing networks Gnutella and LimeWire .
He collected 3,328 files with potentially sensitive medical information ; about 5 % held data that could be used to fraudulently buy drugs or bill treatments .
Data thieves are using such simple steps , too , he says .
Data - stealing gangs could begin reaching out to laid - off or disgruntled employees who know their employers ' tech systems , security experts warn .
Database security firm Application Security 's recent audits of 179 organizations found 56 % had suffered at least one data breach in the past 12 months .
The survey does not reveal how any particular breach happened .
" It 's a three - legged beast , " says Pat Clawson , CEO of Lumension Security .
" There is an absolute crunch in IT spending , there are more profit - minded hackers , and employees with access to valuable data " are willing to sell access to criminals .
About 75 % of the 1,400 tech operations and information management professionals recently surveyed by Lumension and Ponemon Institute said cybercrime remains a major concern , despite efforts to thwart hackers .
" In the next year or two , these challenges will increase in both breadth and depth of threats , " says Larry Ponemon , chairman of Ponemon Institute .
' It 's so easy '
In a recent episode that reflected the complexity of leading - edge attacks , three different thieves collaborated to steal $ 99,000 from a credit union , says Tom Miltonberger , CEO of security firm Guardian Analytics .
The first thief pilfered a credit union member 's online account user ID and password , and gave it to a second thief .
That person then logged on several times to see images of cleared checks and to monitor the balance available on a pre-approved home equity line of credit , says Miltonberger , who investigated the case .
That information went to a third thief , who drew up a forged fax request with instructions to transfer funds from the home equity line of credit into the checking account , and then to wire those funds to another account .
Because the forged signature was so good , the credit union carried out the transfer .
No one has been arrested in the case .
In another recent attack , someone acquired the user name and password for a system administrator at CheckFree.com , the nation 's largest e-bill payment system .
Using those log - in credentials , an intruder gained access to Check Free 's domain name service account — an account that permits the administrator to redirect traffic trying to access Check Free 's home page to other legitimate company pages .
For several hours , the intruder redirected anyone typing www.mycheckfree.com to a Web server in the Ukraine that tried to install a password - stealing Trojan .
Although as many as 160,000 customers may have been affected , none had any of his or her data stolen , says Lori Stafford - Thomas , a spokeswoman for Fiserv , the parent company of CheckFree .
" Check Free sites are all up and running properly and securely , " she says .
But the attempt was a sign of things to come , says Amit Klein , CTO of security firm Trusteer .
" The moral of this attack is that it 's so easy to take over your ( website ) , " Klein says .
" I just need to get ahold of your user name and password once .
And we all know how easy it is to get your credentials . "
Beverage merchandiser Terrazas knows all too well the downside of having one 's sensitive data stolen .
He says Bank of America covered the illicit charge to his debit card and gave him a new card account number .
But he had to alter several other financial accounts to reflect the change , and he no longer trusts using his debit card to pay bills or make purchases online .
" It 's a bummer that somebody took my information , " he says .
" But if I do n't want this to happen again , this is what I have to do . "

In the era of embedded media , independent journalists have become the eyes and ears of the world .
Without those un-embedded journalists willing to risk their lives to place themselves on the other side of the barrel of the tank or the gun or under the air strikes , history would be written almost entirely from the vantage point of powerful militaries , or – at the very least – it would be told from the perspective of the troops doing the shooting , rather than the civilians , who always pay the highest price .
In the case of the Iraq invasion and occupation , the journalists who have placed themselves in danger most often are local Iraqi journalists .
Some 116 Iraqi journalists and media workers have been killed in the line of duty since March 2003 .
In all , 189 journalists have been killed in Iraq .
At least 16 of these journalists were killed by the U.S. military , according to the Committee to Protect Journalists .
The network that has most often found itself under U.S. attack is al - Jazeera .
As I wrote a few years ago in The Nation :
" The United States bombed its offices in Afghanistan in 2001 , shelled the Basra hotel where al - Jazeera journalists were the only guests in April 2003 , killed Iraq correspondent Tareq Ayoub a few days later in Baghdad , and imprisoned several al - Jazeera reporters ( including at Guantánamo ) , some of whom say they were tortured .
In addition to the military attacks , the U.S. - backed Iraqi government banned the network from reporting in Iraq . "
A new report for a leading neoconservative group that pushes a belligerent " Israel first " agenda of conquest in the Middle East suggests that in future wars the U.S. should make censorship of media official policy and advocates " military attacks on the partisan media " ( via MuzzleWatch ) .
The report for JINSA , the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs , was authored by retired U.S. Army Col. Ralph Peters .
It appears in JINSA ’s " flagship publication , " The Journal of International Security Affairs .
" Today , the United States and its allies will never face a lone enemy on the battlefield .
There will always be a hostile third party in the fight , " Peters writes , calling the media " the killers without guns . "
" Of course , the media have shaped the outcome of conflicts for centuries , from the European wars of religion through Vietnam .
More recently , though , the media have determined the outcomes of conflicts .
While journalists and editors ultimately failed to defeat the U.S. government in Iraq , video cameras and biased reporting guaranteed that Hezbollah would survive the 2006 war with Israel and , as of this writing , they appear to have saved Hamas from destruction in Gaza . …
" Although it seems unthinkable now , future wars may require censorship , news blackouts , and , ultimately , military attacks on the partisan media .
Perceiving themselves as superior beings , journalists have positioned themselves as protected - species combatants .
But freedom of the press stops when its abuse kills our soldiers and strengthens our enemies .
Such a view arouses disdain today , but a media establishment that has forgotten any sense of sober patriotism may find that it has become tomorrow ’s conventional wisdom .
" The point of all this is simple : Win .
In warfare , nothing else matters .
If you cannot win clean , win dirty .
But win .
Our victories are ultimately in humanity ’s interests , while our failures nourish monsters . "
It is , of course , very appropriate that such a despicable battle cry for murdering media workers appears in a JINSA publication .
The organization has long boasted an all - star cast of criminal " advisers , " among them Dick Cheney , Richard Perle , James Woolsey , John Bolton , and Douglas Feith .
JINSA , along with the Project for a New American Century , was one of the premiere groups in shaping U.S. policy during the Bush years and remains a formidable force with Obama in the White House .
Reading Peters ’ sick and twisted essay reminded me of the report that emerged in late 2005 about an alleged Bush administration plot to bomb al - Jazeera ’s international headquarters in Qatar , which I covered for The Nation :
" Britain ’s Daily Mirror reported that during an April 2004 White House meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair , George W. Bush floated the idea of bombing al - Jazeera ’s international headquarters in Qatar .
This allegation was based on leaked ‘ Top Secret ’ minutes of the Bush - Blair summit .
British Attorney General Lord Goldsmith has activated the Official Secrets Act , threatening any publication that publishes any portion of the memo ( he has already brought charges against a former Cabinet staffer and a former parliamentary aide ) .
So while we do n’t yet know the contents of the memo , we do know that at the time of Bush ’s meeting with Blair , the administration was in the throes of a very public , high - level temper tantrum directed against al - Jazeera .
The meeting took place on April 16 , at the peak of the first U.S. siege of Fallujah , and al - Jazeera was one of the few news outlets broadcasting from inside the city .
Its exclusive footage was being broadcast by every network from CNN to the BBC .
" The Fallujah offensive , one of the bloodiest assaults of the U.S. occupation , was a turning point .
In two weeks that April , 30 Marines were killed as local guerrillas resisted U.S. attempts to capture the city .
Some 600 Iraqis died , many of them women and children .
Al - Jazeera broadcast from inside the besieged city , beaming images to the world .
On live TV the network gave graphic documentary evidence disproving U.S. denials that it was killing civilians .
It was a public relations disaster , and the United States responded by attacking the messenger .
" Just a few days before Bush allegedly proposed bombing the network , al - Jazeera ’s correspondent in Fallujah , Ahmed Mansour , reported live on the air , ‘ Last night we were targeted by some tanks , twice … but we escaped .
The U.S. wants us out of Fallujah , but we will stay . ’
On April 9 Washington demanded that al - Jazeera leave the city as a condition for a cease - fire .
The network refused .
Mansour wrote that the next day ‘ American fighter jets fired around our new location , and they bombed the house where we had spent the night before , causing the death of the house owner Mr. Hussein Samir .
Due to the serious threats we had to stop broadcasting for few days because every time we tried to broadcast the fighter jets spotted us we became under their fire . ’
" On April 11 senior military spokesperson Mark Kimmitt declared , ‘ The stations that are showing Americans intentionally killing women and children are not legitimate news sources .
That is propaganda , and that is lies . ’
On April 15 Donald Rumsfeld echoed those remarks in distinctly undiplomatic terms , calling al - Jazeera ’s reporting ‘ vicious , inaccurate , and inexcusable … .
It ’s disgraceful what that station is doing . ’
It was the very next day , according to the Daily Mirror , that Bush told Blair of his plan .
‘ He made clear he wanted to bomb al - Jazeera in Qatar and elsewhere , ’ a source told the Mirror .
‘ There ’s no doubt what Bush wanted to do – and no doubt Blair did n’t want him to do it . ’ "
Lest people think that the views of people like Ralph Peters and the JINSA / PNAC neocons are relics of the past , remember that the Obama administration includes heavy hitters from this world among its ranks , as well as fierce neocon supporters .
While they may no longer be literally calling the shots , as they did under Bush / Cheney , their disproportionate influence on U.S. policy endures .

Cabinet
GOP Stymies Vote on Sebelius
Updated 2:05 p.m.
By Ceci Connolly
President Obama will have to wait a bit longer to round out his Cabinet .
Senate Republicans refused today to allow a confirmation vote on his health secretary nominee Gov. Kathleen Sebelius ( D - Kan . ) .
She is the last Cabinet member awaiting Senate approval .
At the start of the session today , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) proposed taking a vote after five hours of debate .
But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) objected , arguing that lawmakers needed more time to consider her " fairly contentious " selection .
A handful of Republicans have complained about Sebelius ' support for abortion rights and her failure to report the full extent of campaign contributions she received from a physician who performs abortions .
Sen. Jon Kyl ( R - Ariz . ) opposes
Sebelius because of the Obama administration 's support for research on the comparative effectiveness of disease treatments .
He said he fears the evidence - based approach , coupled with information on price , could lead to rationing of care .
In the Senate Finance Committee Tuesday , eight of 10 GOP members opposed her nomination .
Two Republicans , Sens. Pat Roberts of Kansas and Olympia Snowe of Maine , voted to confirm her .
During her long stint in Kansas politics , Sebelius has been known as a moderate with strong relations across the aisle .
She chose a running mate two years ago who had been a Republican Party leader .
Reid spokesman Jim Manley said today that , if necessary , the Democratic leader intends to pursue the procedural maneuvers needed to overcome a Republican filibuster .
That would likely push a confirmation vote into next week .
" We 're confident there will be the 60 votes needed to confirm her , " Manley said .
This afternoon , McConnell 's office clarified in a statement that the nomination is " not stymied , she 's just not getting confirmed today " and said that concerns about a filibuster are premature .

THE government of China and the large natural - resources companies it controls have made little secret of their hunger for foreign assets .
But using their overflowing coffers to make acquisitions has not been easy .
In 2005 America 's Congress objected to the efforts of the partially state - owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation ( CNOOC ) to buy Unocal , an American rival .
Chinalco , a state - controlled aluminium firm , has stirred up opposition in Australia with its bid to enlarge its stake in Rio Tinto , an Anglo - Australian mining giant .
No wonder big Chinese firms with government ties have been looking for more oblique and less obtrusive ways to expand abroad .
A deal unveiled on May 24th , in which PetroChina , another partially state - owned oil firm , will buy a big stake in Singapore Petroleum , a refiner , hints at a new tactic .
Although producers are particularly eager to drum up investors amid the credit crunch and the accompanying sharp fall in commodity prices , national governments are leery about approving outright acquisitions by Chinese firms .
One reason is a lack of reciprocity : although China complains about nationalist impediments of the sort that blocked the Unocal transaction , it tolerates little involvement by non-Chinese companies in its own energy industry .
So several recent Chinese investments have taken more roundabout forms .
Over the past three months the state - owned China Development Bank has agreed to lend billions of dollars to state - controlled Brazilian and Russian oil firms in exchange for long - term supplies of crude .
Meanwhile CNOOC and PetroChina have each done multi-billion - dollar deals tied to the development of specific gas projects in Australia , blurring the line between investments and supply contracts .
The Singaporean purchase appears more straightforward .
PetroChina , China 's largest energy company , will pay $ 1 billion for the 45 % stake in Singapore Petroleum held by Keppel Corp , a conglomerate in which Temasek , Singapore 's state investment fund , owns a big shareholding .
The target is not celebrated or strategic enough to occasion much adverse comment , and the transaction appears to enjoy the support of Singapore 's government .
PetroChina has offered a substantial premium to the stockmarket price .
The deal is already the largest in Singapore since 2001 and will probably lead to an offer for remaining 55 % .
Singaporean bankers and investors , who have been pounded in the recent slump , are thrilled .
But PetroChina has said Singapore Petroleum could serve as a platform for future transactions .
That suggests it might try to use the Singaporean firm to pursue the kinds of acquisitions that it would be blocked from making directly .
After all , Singapore 's own openness to foreign investment , and its record in managing numerous passive overseas holdings , means it is a welcome partner in the rich world .
In 2006 a Singaporean investment in Great Wall Airlines , based in Shanghai , apparently helped secure the lifting of American sanctions imposed after the Treasury Department accused its then ( and soon after former ) parent , China Great Wall Industry Corp , of supplying Iran with missile components .
Yet the benefits PetroChina would receive from having an acquisition vehicle in Singapore would be limited .
Concerns still hover around acquisitions by Chinese state - run firms , whether done directly or through a subsidiary , even if the subsidiary is in a friendly country .
PetroChina will not be free to invest wherever and however it likes until it is liberated from its controlling shareholder at home .
People in Mexico have been wearing masks as a precaution A third of the world 's population could be infected with swine flu , expert projections suggest .
Researchers say swine flu has " full pandemic potential " , spreading readily between people and is likely to go global in the next six to nine months .
Although one in three who come in contact will likely become infected , the Imperial College London team declined to estimate the death toll .
The study based on Mexico 's experience is published in the journal Science .
The number of laboratory - confirmed swine flu cases has reached 5,251 in some 30 countries around the world , with 61 having died from the disease , the World Health Organization has confirmed .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from Today programme Working in collaboration with the WHO and public health agencies in Mexico , the researchers assessed the Mexico epidemic using data to the end of April and taking into account factors like international spread and viral genetic diversity .
Lead researcher Professor Neil Ferguson said it was too early to say whether the virus will cause deaths on a massive scale , or prove little more lethal than normal seasonal flu .
His " fast and dirty " analysis of Mexico 's swine flu outbreak suggests that the H1N1 virus is about as dangerous as the virus behind a 1957 pandemic that killed 2 million people worldwide .
But it 's not nearly as lethal as the bug that caused the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic , which caused an estimated 50 million deaths in 1918 .
Its full impact on the UK is not likely to be known until the annual flu season in the autumn and winter , when a " really major epidemic " can be expected in the northern hemisphere , says Professor Ferguson .
Prof Ferguson , who sits on the World Health Organisation 's emergency committee for the outbreak , told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme : " This virus really does have full pandemic potential .
It is likely to spread around the world in the next six to nine months and when it does so it will affect about one - third of the world 's population .
" To put that into context , normal seasonal flu every year probably affects around 10 % of the world 's population every year , so we are heading for a flu season which is perhaps three times worse than usual - not allowing for whether this virus is more severe than normal seasonal flu viruses . "
His study suggests swine flu could kill four in every 1,000 infected people .
Professor Ferguson said his findings confirmed that decisions must be taken swiftly on vaccine production .
" We really need to be prepared , particularly for the autumn .
At the moment , the virus is not spreading fast in the northern hemisphere , because we are outside the normal flu season , but come the autumn it is likely to cause a really major epidemic .
" One of the key decisions which has to be made this week by the world community is how much do we switch over current vaccine production for seasonal flu to make a vaccine against this particular virus ?
I think those decisions need to be made quickly . "

Is Second Life about to become the new Times Square ?
The virtual world is to be cleaned up , according to reports , …
The Belgian priest argued that its goals could not be realised " except at the price of sacrificing religious freedom , of the imposition of a ' politically correct ' interpretation of the Sacred Scriptures and of the sabotage of the natural foundations of law " .
Mandrake reported earlier this month that William Chapman , the foundation 's director of policy , stepped down amid rumours of a dispute over Blair 's " lecturing ' ' of the Pope on homosexuality .
George Monbiot travels to Manchester to go head - to - head with Labour MP Hazel Blears , and asks her why she thinks the government is made up of ' decent people ' – even though they 've supported a brutal dictator in Uzbekistan
Residents of a house on Seventh Street Southeast were served with eviction notices Monday afternoon as a result of legal action taken by their landlord , Dinkytown Rentals owner Tim Harmsen , regarding the riot that occurred on the block Saturday night .
The students could be forced to move out as soon as Thursday morning , pending a judgeâ Äôs decision in Hennepin County Housing Court , Harmsen said .
The residents of the brown duplex , distinguishable by a large deck of cards on its second story deck , violated several conditions of their lease , Harmsen said .
Both the upper and lower units are facing eviction for unlawful assembly , destruction of property , providing numerous kegs to minors during an earlier party and receiving numerous noise complaints , Harmsen said .
âÄú They had 300 to 400 people over , and were providing six or seven kegs of beer to a party , âÄ ù he added .
The students facing eviction were advised by University Student Legal Service to not comment to the media .
Discuss the issue further at Daily Forums :
What should happen next year ?
Third Ward councilwoman Diane Hofstede , who represents the Dinkytown area , said the community has expressed a concern that an event like this will happen again .
âÄúThereâÄôs a great deal of disappointment in the students , âÄ ù Hofstede said .
âÄú It was a drunken brawl and it was a dangerous situation .
âÄù Usually , residents have at least seven days after an eviction notice before they first appear in court , student legal service attorney Bill Dane said .
Harmsen received an expedited hearing for the case , meaning the issue will go before a court within three days of serving the tenants with legal papers .
âÄúItâÄôs not a very common practice for the court to shorten up the process , âÄ ù Dane said .
The first appearance is an opportunity for the students to agree or disagree with the charges , Dane said .
If they disagree with the eviction , it would bring the issue to trial .
Harmsen said he will review his lease agreement and will consider adding new stipulations to ensure things like this donâÄôt happen in the future .
âÄú What happened Saturday night will not be tolerated if I have anything to do with it , âÄ ù Harmsen said Monday .
Dan Oberpriller , landlord of a house across the street from the residents , said the house in question was out of control for most of the day .
Harmsen said he thought Minneapolis police did a good job of controlling the riot , but felt that there should have been more arrests .
OberprillerâÄôs tenants were one of three parties that hosted keg races on the block early Saturday morning , according to its residents .
However , his tenants did not violate their lease , Oberpriller said .
Laurel Edwards , a tenant in OberprillerâÄôs property , said Oberpriller came to the house around 12:30 p.m. to make sure things were under control .
âÄúThings were very controlled behind our house , âÄ ù Edwards said .
âÄúThere were two other parties besides ours that all poured out onto the street .
âÄù Oberpriller , owner of College Property Management , said he maintained communication with his tenants throughout the day .
He said he instructed them to keep their doors locked and not to let anybody inside .
Oberpriller said he supported the police action .
âÄúPolice did a good job in maintaining order and not being too aggressive with the situation , âÄ ù he said .
Oberpriller and Harmsen are both on the board of a recently established âÄúlandlord student advocacy group ,
âÄ ù which they said they hope can encompass students , landlords , homeowners and members of the greek community .
âÄúDinkytown is a real sensitive place right now for landlords and tenants , âÄù Oberpriller said .
âÄú
The neighborhood associations need to have more representation from students .

Microsoft ( NSDQ : MSFT ) will discontinue both its MSN Encarta reference Web sites as well as its Encarta software , which have both been surpassed by rising competitors , like Wikipedia .
In a message posted on the MSN Encarta Web site , Microsoft says , “ Encarta has been a popular product around the world for many years .
However , the category of traditional encyclopedias and reference material has changed .
People today seek and consume information in considerably different ways than in years past . ”
Online , Microsoft offered a limited selection of professionally edited content for free and a larger selection for a subscription .
But the offerings paled when compared to those at sites that could use the work of thousands of contributors .
Wikipedia , for instance , offers 2.7 million articles in English .
Google ’s Knol , which like Wikipedia depends on user - generated content , has more than 100,000 .
Encarta has 42,000 entries .
Encarta did try to adapt , inviting users to submit suggestions for changes to articles , but those suggestions first had to be checked by a member of the Encarta staff .
And Encarta did not allow users to submit new entries .
The decision to cut Encarta also comes as Microsoft looks to cut costs .
The company has discontinued several products this year , including its Train Simulator game .
A Microsoft spokeswoman would not say whether any jobs would be cut due to the closing of Encarta .
“ The decision to exit the Encarta business is one piece of a broader strategy to continue to evolve our product offerings to address the next wave of people ’s search and research needs , ” she said .
“ We will continue to evaluate online reference business opportunities and will consider how Encarta and key learnings acquired over the past nearly 20 years of developing it can inform and strengthen our future educational solutions . ” .
The news was first reported by Ars Technica .

I wrote this April 3 , 2009 the day the Iowa Supreme Court ruled the ban on same - sex marriage was unconstitutional
This morning the Iowa Supreme Court unanimously ruled to overturn the ban on same - sex marriage and granted full marriage equality to gays and lesbians .
In December 2008 , my partner and I purchased tickets to return to Iowa from Seattle during this week to welcome my new born nephew to the world .
Our timing was perfect .
He was born just days before our arrival .
Of coarse I was overjoyed by the experience of becoming an uncle for the first time .
It helped that my little nephew is the cutest baby ever to grace this lonely planet .
Like any new baby , it was easy to project hopes and dreams upon him — to imagine the amazing story waiting to be told before his eyes .
When I was browsing the available tickets to Iowa , I said to my partner of five years Joe Brokken , “ would n’t it be great if the court ruled while we were home ? ” I had patiently followed Varnum vs. Brian for years and knew the court could rule at any moment .
I imagined what it might be like for the state that we called home for most of our lives to grant us full equality .
I tried to imagine at least .
Yesterday afternoon I was preparing to leave Iowa for my new home Seattle , when I received a text message from Amy Balliett .
It read , “ Are you in Iowa ?
I hope you will be celebrating .
The court rules tomorrow . ”
Amy and I are working together to organize a Day of Decision rally in Seattle for the day the California Supreme Court rules on proposition 8 .
I immediately interpreted her message as a signal to spread the word to the city to prepare for the rally .
I sent out a mass e-mail announcing the California decision was coming down and to prepare to celebrate or protest .
Seconds later my e-mail / facebook / twitter was flooded with people more than willing to help , and others drawing attention to my mistake .
It was not California that was to rule , but Iowa .
As quickly as possible I stopped the presses and corrected my mistake .
It began to dawn on me that I may just be hours away from witnessing history , but more importantly , moments away from being an equal citizen in Iowa .
I called my partner who was with his family and told him the exciting news .
“ The Iowa decision is coming down tomorrow .
Do you think we should extend our tickets and get married ? ” I asked .
“ Well let ’s see what happens , ” he said .
Our parents met for the first time last night .
The plans were set well before politics were in play .
His mom and dad and my mom and dad hit it off wonderfully .
I spent most of the dinner holding my nephew while admiring how perfect he was .
My partner held him for a while .
“ Joe will be a great father ” , I thought as he cradled my sleeping nephew and held his little hand .
I fell in love with him all over again .
I could not sleep last night .
I was like a child on Christmas eve .
As I laid awake , my seventeen year old cat Snickers , who was the first being I came out to , purred in my arms .
I thought about my gay and lesbian brothers and sisters who have brought us this far .
I thought about Matthew Shepherd who was murdered a mere week before I came out .
I thought about the millions of gays and lesbians in this country and throughout the world who would one day benefit from full equality .
I thought about the daunting fight still ahead of us .
It was overwhelming .
This morning I nearly leaped from bed .
I immediately logged onto the Cedar Rapids Gazette homepage .
The headline read , “ Same - sex marriage now legal in Iowa ” .
I read it several times just to soak it in .
“ This is really happening .
This is real , ” I reminded myself .
My heart swelled with happiness and a transcendent feeling swept through my body .
We ate breakfast with my father .
I said , “ So dad , your son will finally be treated as an equal citizen in Iowa . ”
He said , “ Well now you will have to pay the marriage penalty tax . ”
( That ’s his way of saying congratulations . )
I corrected him , though and said , “ Well actually , we are still not recognized at the federal level .
This is one step in a very long fight . ”
On our way from Cedar Rapids to the Des Moines airport Joe and I decided to stop in Iowa City to try to get a marriage license .
We went to see Kimberly Painter , the Johnson County Registrar .
Several years ago a group of gays and lesbians tried to get marriage licenses from her as an act of civil disobedience .
She was forced to deny them licenses .
It was a heartbreaking scene .
Painter is an out lesbian and knew several of the couples she had to deny .
I remember her crying while saying on the news that it was her job to uphold the law of Iowa despite her own opinion .
I wanted to see her today to celebrate with her .
My partner and I walked up to the desk and nearly shouted , “ We want to get married ! ”
At first an unknown woman stood up from her desk , walked over and said , “ Are you … I mean …. um …. ”
We shouted , “ Yes WE — he and I — want to get married ! ”
Kimberly Painter came from outside her office and relived her nervous employee .
She smiled and handed us the application to apply for a marriage license .
She explained how to fill out the forms and instructed us to mail them in .
She told us the ruling would go into effect in 21 days .
She warned us that the process may change during the waiting period .
For example , the form we took still said bride and groom .
My partner and I teased each other , “ Your name is going in the bride section , ” I quipped .
“ No Yours is ! ” We both laughed .
Either way , we would have a marriage license waiting for us to pick up when we returned home .
Painter would hold onto our license until we came back to Iowa , she promised .
I thanked her profusely and started to cry .
“ I ca n’t believe this is real .
Thank you , thank you ! ” I saw tears in her eyes .
She said she planned to marry her partner too .
We nearly skipped to our rental car , “ Let ’s do this right . ”
I said , “ Let ’s stop by the Iowa State Capital in Des Moines before we go to the airport . ”
During the hour and half drive we drove through Iowa ’s golden rolling hills filled with the remnants of last season ’s corn .
The sun shown down and glistened off farm ponds and stream beds as I imagined the spring planting about to fill the fields before me .
I thought about how simple and beautiful Iowa was and how proud I am to call it home .
I began to cry with happiness .
We turned on the AM radio hoping to hear some commentary on the history occurring .
The first station was discussing how to repair a ditch after a flood .
The second station was discussing how to prevent Japanese Beetle infestations in the fall .
I was beginning to wonder if we were the only people paying attention .
It is easy to feel alone in Iowa .
But then , on the hour , AM 910 Iowa Public Radio played a piece about the ruling .
It was a recording of Lambda Legal proudly announcing the unanimous decision and telling the plaintiffs they could marry in a short 21 days .
The radio piece also quoted both majority leaders from the Iowa House and Senate celebrating the Supreme Court ’s decision .
They said , “ We are proud of Iowa ’s long history of pioneering civil rights issues .
There will be no constitutional amendment this session . ”
Joe and I both began to cry , AGAIN , as it sunk in that this state would not fall victim to a constitutional amendment banning our equality any time soon — hopefully never .
When we arrived at the Iowa State Capital the sun reflected gloriously on the golden capital dome .
Other than some hammering at a nearby construction zone , there was no one around .
It was quiet , peaceful — not a protester in site .
I got on my knee and looked up at the love of my life and said , “ I would be honored if you would spend the rest of your life with me .
Will you marry me ? ”
He smiled and said , “ Yes , yes I will . ”
We quickly kissed , almost as if we expected someone to stop us .
No one did .
A KCRG TV 9 van pulled up and parked next to our car as we descended the capital steps .
A news anchor emerged from the white satellite van .
I assumed he was there for a story about marriage in Iowa so I shouted , “ We ’re going to get married !
I just proposed and he said yes ! ”
The news man smiled and congratulated us .
That was it .
He was there to report on the construction project .
I laughed and said , “ Well I guess the news here is that equality is becoming less of a news story . ”
My fiance said , “ He would n’t know a good story if it bit him on the ass ! ”
I ’m sitting on my flight back to Seattle right now .
My fiance is blissfully improving the Sky Mall catalogue with humorous edits .
I ’m still fighting back occasional tears as I write this .
I ’m thinking about how transformative this decision will be for the country .
Iowa ’s first in the nation caucus status brings every presidential hopeful to the doorsteps of my friends and neighbors begging them for their attention .
From now on they will be forced to confront families who are treated equally despite their sexual orientation .
According to a recent University of Iowa poll 65 % of Iowans support legal protection for same - sex couples .
Future candidates better get on board now if they want to perform well in Iowa .
More importantly , I am thinking about how amazing it is going to be for my nephew to grow up in Iowa .
He will likely read about today in history books and wonder how a country that prides itself on freedom could ever discriminate against gays and lesbians .
My relationship will be no more remarkable than his parents .
I will be able to tell him , “ I was there on April 3 , 2009 .
The sun was bright and warm .
Spring was on the horizon and we felt like we could do anything .
Your uncle and I proposed to each other that day .
I never felt more alive or more in love . ”
There is nothing worse than being sober in a room full of drunk people .
OK , so there are a few things worse ?
like cancer , famine and finding out your dad wants to be a woman .
Anyway , the points is , drunk people in real life are soooooo annoying .
Almost as annoying as people who put to many ‘o ’s in ‘ so ’ just to emphasise the point they are making .
But they are never that annoying when you are drunk .
For some reason , you are immune to the annoying stuff they blather on about .
See kids , drinking is good for you .
But put drunks in a movie and suddenly you start to see the joke ; suddenly cease to be annoying and become quit charming and very funny .
Either this is because actors and scriptwriters suck at making people sound authentically pissed , or it's because you know at no time of the evening are they going to seek you out to go and slobber “ I love you , man ” in your ear .
But which movie drunks were the best ?
Hecklerspray plumbs the depths .

But it is certainly up there , with Jack Lemmon in top form .
19 . Alan Swann ( Peter O?Toole )
From : My Favourite Year
Best line :
After stumbling into the wrong restroom , a lady tells him : ?

16 . Gary ( Anthony Michael Hall )
From : Weird Science
OK , so he is not strictly a drunk , but the scene in which he gets out his face is the best scene in the movie .
15 . Captain Jack Sparrow ? ( Johnny Depp )
From : Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy
Johnny Depp does a very good job of impersonating the legend that is Keith Richards , a man whose body should be donated to science to help create a race of super - humans that can withstand years of alcohol and narcotic abuse .
14 . Henry Chinaski ( Mickey Rourke )

Brilliant movie , but Val Kilmer – once again stretching his pretending credentials by playing a pissed - up gunslinger ?is the star of the show .

An executive with the French government - owned energy company EDF " has been charged on suspicion of spying on the environmental group Greenpeace . "
The executive , " who previously worked as a police commander , is being investigated for conspiring to hack into Greenpeace France 's computer system . "
Under investigation is whether EDF , " the world 's biggest nuclear - reactor operator , hired a private detective agency run by a former member of the French secret services to illegally spy on environmentalists and infiltrate their ranks . "
EDF confirmed that it hired the firm , Kargus Consultants , but denies " ordering the use of any illegal spying methods . "
A Kargus employee admitted that he hacked into the computer system used by Greenpeace France 's campaigns director in 2006 .
Greenpeace thinks the spying " could have been related to their campaign to block EDF 's construction of a vast , new generation nuclear reactor in Flamanville " in northern France .
Greenpeace France is tightening office security and saying the incident " shows just how frightened the nuclear industry is of transparency and a democratic debate . "
EDF recently bought British Energy and " nearly half of U.S. group Constellation Energy 's nuclear power business ... in order to build power plants in Britain and the United States , " according to Reuters .
Directed by McG , the highly - anticipated film stars Christian Bale , Sam Worthington , Anton Yelchin , Bryce Dallas Howard , Moon Bloodgood and Common .
Kinopoisk has posted a few ( ILM ) artist ‘s concept art images from the new ” ( ) movie , which is set for release on May 21 , 2009 .
Concept arts giving us a close - up look at Hunter Killer aerial unit called a Transporter , a human interacting with a virtual SkyNet system of sorts , and a different version of the giant robot called The Harvester that we ’ve seen in the trailers a few times before .
Set in post - apocalyptic 2018 the film picks up the story of hero John Connor , played by Bale .
The rebel leader has a personal vendetta with the Terminators who killed his mother ( originally played by Linda Hamilton ) and his father .
And he is the man fated to be the leader of the human resistance against Skynet and its army of Terminators .
And the future he was raised to believe in is altered in part by the appearance of Marcus Wright ( Sam Worthington ) , a stranger whose last memory is of being on death row .
Connor must decide whether Marcus has been sent from the future , or rescued from the past .

If you were at the FUCKING AWESOME Shibaricon in Chicago this past weekend , you know how much WIN was contained therein .
I ’ve been traveling bunches this past 6 months or so .
More than ever before in conjunction with BDSM scene events .
Much of the time , I spend an inordinate amount of time in my room watching Deadliest Catch marathons , or insanely mindblowingly shitty B - Movies and Twittering .
Not this time .
Not only had I worked up the ovaries to ask several people to play , I had an extra guest ticket to the event .
Rather than moping about not having a date , I enlisted the help of a friend from Twitter to sort of be my ConBuddy and nudger .
Someone there to poke me if I was hiding and who was tasked , if I needed it , to hide with me so I felt that much less lame .
And you know what ?
She may well have been my lucky charm because so much fell into place .
I hit the ground calmly , even though I missed the Presenters Welcoming speech , etc .
My flight was taxiing when it began and goodness knows ORD is a HUGE place to navigate when you are in a hurry !
I had a lovely supper with Viviane , and took a stroll around the playspace , but went to ground early .
Mostly because I was a but bummed I could n’t work out any of the play - dates I was hoping to have into that first night , but also because I have someone who has caught my fancy and I was looking forward to chatting with him before it got too late .
I did manage to run into the several with whom I wanted to play , so we reconnected in that way .
This was a magic con for that .
I literally ran into who I needed to see precisely when I needed to see them , over and over and over .
I even managed to have some of “ Ah , there you are , I ’ve been expecting you ! ” moments of connectivity with Old Friends I ’d not yet met .
Very magical .
I bonded with some women of intense power this weekend .
and to them I give my deepest thanks for touching my heart .
My class was n’t until the last day of the con , and early morning at that , so I was free and loose most of the weekend .
I DID have the appearance in the Cabaret show on Saturday night , and that was a lot of fun !
Note to self : wearing my ST : TOS uniform is a guaranteed way to garner much fanboy and fangirl love .
I mean , hey , who HASN ’T fantasized about gang - roping Uhura ??
Really .
So did she play ?
This is the question !
After a shitload of Cons , and the last scene I ’ve had being at KinkFest in Portland … in 2008 ( !!!!)
I am proud to say I finally have broken the drought .
Big time .
The inimitable Lolita Wolf broke the seal , in more ways that one .
I was able to chat with her earlier in the evening , finally find a place to play and yegodholyhell the woman knows her way around a butt .
And she did n’t even get mad when I …um …well …was rather copiously grateful for her attentions .
Grateful enough to spread copiousness all over her crinoline and onto her boots .
blushing .
Full scene report here :-D
This was followed up by a really , really fun scene with Lqqout , who I managed to not only beat in a nipple - twisting contest , but also tagged in the grapes while I was in a partial suspension .
Yay me !
Sunday was busy with classes , and more fun , as a friend I ’d met at Beyond Leather and i got together for a very intense scene .
Having never played with Deiter before , I was not at all certain what to expect but i think now I can expect a really wonderful intensity and awesome time .
Oh and lost of delectable roughness .
Sunday evening wrapped up with a surprisingly cathartic scene with Gray , who managed to create space enough for me to lose myself to complete and upper break - down - sobbing - tears by the end of the scene … and I am fairly certain I was speaking in tongues there by the end .
Hey…its what I do .
I even got him to safeword later in the evening .
Even the most famous tops bow before the mighty might of …The Chicken Dance .
My class was at the asscrack of dawn ( Hey , 10:00 AM on the Monday closing day of a 4 - Day con is BRUTAL , y’all ! ) but the attendance was great , the people in the class were SO present and supportive and the demo was truly inspired .
Much love to Gray , Lqqout and Deiter for their ebilz … and extra love to Lqqout for being my truffle hero !
I am deeply grateful to each and every person who was there .
You made it worthwhile to me .
And I received the ultimate compliment from one of the people who joined me for the session , and felt so honored and humbled and wonderful !
If you DID attend my class , and you enjoyed it , and would like to have Shibaricon invite me back and sponsor more classes from the bottom / submissive POV , why not drop a note and let them know that ?
guests at Shibaricon dot com is the address :-)
Thankfully I bookended the trip with another night at the hotel .
Managed to stave off some of the drop by decompressing with friends , relaxing , leaving at a leisurely pace .
Most wonderfully I had the chance to spend time with some of the Shibaricon Staff and those are some badass fuckers right there , let me tell you .
My Aftercare Truffles for Tops were a big hit , by the way .
If you are a bottom type person , consider treating the person who whips you into a sobbing puddle of ooze to a delectable after they take you down to subspace and leave you dangling over the edge , only to pull you back .
They ’ll appreciate the thought :-)
And the nommables !
Even when they do mindfuck you into thinking they ’ve eated you precious , precious White Chocolate Key Lime Pie truffles from See’s .

A month ago my boyfriend 's English mother asked me – in all innocence – if I 'd been to the " Tamil Tiger march " in Westminster .
She was referring to one of the many protests organised by the tenacious and active British Tamil Forum , camped 24 hours a day at Westminster for over a month now .
Given the many – and widely photographed – Tamil Tiger flags at the protests , little wonder she mistook Tamils for Tigers .
Born a Tamil in England at about the same time the Tigers were founded , I know that , sadly , if you have heard of Tamils at all , you have probably linked us in your mind to a group of rebel fighters who pioneered the art of suicide bombing and once assassinated the prime minister of India , Rajiv Gandhi .
Separating the Tamils from the terrorists is n't just about correcting an alliterative slip or an image problem – it's at the core of the Sri Lankan conflict , and why the international community is dithering over one of the most appalling humanitarian situations of our time .
In Sri Lanka right now , around 100,000 civilians are trapped in a war zone , where they are being shelled every day by their government .
A further 200,000 are in army - controlled internment camps without adequate food or water – and no sign of them being let out any time soon .
They are all Tamil , like me and my family .
That is about 10 % of the entire Tamil population in Sri Lanka .
To put it into perspective , it 's about a quarter of the population of the entire Gaza strip .
There are two possible reasons why this is happening .
First , that the Tamil Tigers are terrorists , and civilian deaths are unfortunate collateral damage in Sri Lanka 's domestic war on terror .
Or , second , that killing Tamil Tigers is a ruse for killing Tamils , and that the government is using the terrorist line to spin a sinister agenda .
While the international community grapples with Sri Lanka 's insistence that it is the former , a depressing body of evidence points towards the sinister .
There is the censorship – areas restricted to journalists including the " safe " zone where undercover reporters have to sneak out news of horrors .
There is the witch - hunt for dissenters – Sri Lankan bloggers report that the government has now set up a hotline to report on those who question the war , and Unesco just awarded its World Press Freedom prize to Lasantha Wickrematunge , the latest Sri Lankan journalist to pay the ultimate price for free speech .
And there is the state - sponsored terror – Desmond Tutu and Jimmy Carter argued last year that Sri Lanka should be struck off the UN human rights council for its abuses : internment , torture and abductions .
Last week the British foreign secretary , David Miliband , valiantly tried to get the UN to intervene to stop what it has called a " bloodbath " ( you can witness his efforts in the face of creaking bureaucracy here ) .
But in the meantime , the Sri Lankan regime is still getting our support – and because he and every other foreign minister caveats their calls with " the Tamil Tigers are so terrible " line , they add fuel to the Sri Lankan government 's campaign – which then continues to drop bombs on hospitals and children .
Not all Tamils are supporters of the rebels – I 'm certainly not .
Despite all the flags , I know that many of us who are turning out in Parliament Square have a humanitarian agenda , not a pro-rebel one .
But if we want the crisis to stop , we 've got to realise that there 's no use condemning the Tigers and trying to save Tamils , because in the eyes of the Sri Lankan government , we seem to be one and the same .
The hope of the civilians facing mortal harm and starvation in Sri Lanka is that the world will not watch in silence while their lives are destroyed – and will not be fooled by the constant carping about the ills of the Tigers as a justification for throwing every last grain of humanity out of the window .
Solving budget crises at the local level may not be so complicated after all , if the French Gendarmerie Nationale police force is any indication .
By switching to open source software , such as the Ubuntu operating system and OpenOffice instead of Windows and Microsoft Office , the force has saved roughly € 50 million since 2004 .
The best quote comes from Lt. Colonel Xavier Guimard : “ Moving from Microsoft XP to Vista would not have brought us many advantages and Microsoft said it would require training of users , ” he said .
“ Moving from XP to Ubuntu , however , proved very easy .
The two biggest differences are the icons and the games .
Games are not our priority . ”
But what about those sweet , sweet icons ?
No matter , the department says its budget dropped by 70 percent by switching to open source , and it ’s obviously an approach they ’d like to continue in the future .
The entire organization should be running on Linux by 2015 .
My editor , an open source junkie , is probably ecstatic .

The Miss California USA organization paid for Miss California Carrie Prejean 's new breasts to allow her to compete " in the best possible confidence . "
Who knew self esteem came in a plastic bag of silicone ?
Advertisement
Basically , the head of the organization admitted on television last week that , in some way , every single breast displayed for the perusal of the judges or the audience is augmented in some way the ( as yet ) average woman or bra could not achieve and would not regularly attempt .
Keith Lewis told CBS 's Maggie Rodriguez :
" You use chicken cutlets , " he said .
" You use tape .
You use anything that you can to enhance the line .
There 's lots of tricks of the trade . "

And , if that does n't work , you apparently either beg the organization to buy you the implants or pressure your beauty queen into getting them !
One question that struck me was : where did the organizers get the money to buy Miss California 's silicone ?
Well , not that their financials are exactly public , but it appears that each participant in the pageant system has to pay her own way — and it's expensive enough that , like in fashion magazines and pricey restaurants , they do n't tell you the cost before you sign up .
And since the California pageant is n't televised , the organization likely gets its money partly from the national , from corporate and personal sponsorships to the organization , and from corporate and personal sponsorships given to the individual contestants .
That means , of course , that all the Miss California contestants and their sponsors and the corporate sponsors of this year 's pageant paid for Carrie Prejean 's new breasts .
How many of those people do you think feel their money was well - spent ?
I mean , it 's not even like there 's a scholarship or anything .
G/O Media may get a commission First Bag Free
I mean , for fuck 's sake , there 's not even a talent competition : it 's who looks good in a dress , a bikini and can answer a question without sounding like a complete idiot .
As Karry Howley at The XX Factor puts it :
I find both sides of this exchange deeply bizarre , perhaps because I lack the imaginative capacity to envision a swimsuit competition not premised on a certain conception of the female body .
What are they going evaluate ?
Perkiness ?
Gait ?
The actual swimsuit ?

It 's certainly not got the veneer of evaluating one 's baton - twirling .
Samhita at Feministing goes one step further .
The fact that Carrie Prejean got breast implants is not newsworthy to me .
The fact that the California Pageant Association paid for them , well that is .
Not because it is scandalous , but because it shows that pageants are n't about highlighting women as they are or for their talents , but for their physical appearance and to make spectacle of a specific type of femininity .
Pageants only make sense because of binary gender roles that cater to mainstream understandings of femininity .
They are a fetishized spectacle of femininity to the point where it is even OK if they are artificially constructed as long as they are pushing a normative ideal of what a " real woman " is .
Advertisement
This is , I think , a key point .
You can go to Prejean 's gallery and see pictures of her as Miss La Jolla and then Miss California and she is — white , heteronormative , slim , blonde , fake - tan standards aside — a fairly attractive woman .
And yet she risked her life and her appearance for what can best be described as marginally larger breasts — ones that , in 10 years ( when she 's about my age ) , she 'll have to go under the knife again to replace or remove .
And it 's a decision that the pageant organization not only endorsed but funded — unlike the organization sponsoring Miss Virginia , Tara Wheeler , who refused to allow her to shave her head for a children 's cancer charity .
Apparently , a bald and legitimately charitably - minded beauty queen is an anathema , but one with two bags of silicone shoved under her chest muscles at risk to her life , health and future nursing prospects is upholding the ideal of Californian womanhood .
They ought to put that shit in those California tourism commercials .

As a physicist at California Institute of Technology and the author of many books and articles , a number of them on the science of probability , Leonard Mlodinow spends a lot of time considering the question , What are the odds ?
For instance , what are the odds that a single person might write — as Dr. Mlodinow has — a paper titled “ Pseudo - spin Structure and Large N Expansions for a Class of Generalized Helium Hamiltonians , ” a best - selling book with Stephen Hawking and at least one episode of “ McGyver . ” ( Answer : Pretty low . )
Dr. Mlodinow has a particular , and personal , interest how the most painful events can sometimes yield unexpected results .
In the first chapter of his best - seller , “ The Drunkard ’s Walk : How Randomness Rules Our Lives , ” he writes of a conversation with his father , who tells him of how he came to survive his time in the concentration camp in Buchenwald :
It struck me then that I have Hitler to thank for my existence , for the Germans had killed my father ’s wife and two young children , erasing his prior life .
And so were it not for the war , my father would never have emigrated to New York , never have met my mother , also a refugee , and never have produced me and my two brothers …
The outline of our lives , like the candle ’s flame , is continuously coaxed in new directions by a variety of random events that , along with our responses to them , determine our fate .
He answered the following questions via e-mail :
An earlier post by the psychologist Daniel Gilbert makes the argument that uncertainty — not knowing what misfortune will come — makes people more unhappy than misfortune itself .
Do you find that to be true ?
It does seem to be true of my own psychology .
Also , I find that what ’s most important , whatever happens , is how you deal with it .
And once something bad actually happens , you can start that process , and bad can eventually even turn into good .
Many people are understandably anxious and depressed about their present and future situations .
Based on what you know about predictions and human behavior , should they be ?
I find that predicting the course of our lives is like predicting the weather .
You might be able to predict your future in the short term , but the longer you look ahead , the less likely you are to be correct .
In my own life , many things that seemed to be very bad at first actually had good consequences .
For example , just as I had begun making a living writing in Hollywood many years ago , the Writer ’s Guild called a strike .
I thought it was awful for my fledgling career , not to mention financially ruinous .
But as it turned out , the strike gave busy producers a chance to catch up on their reading , and the day the strike ended I got a call from the show runner at “ Star Trek : the Next Generation , ” who said he read a “ McGyver ” script of mine he had found lying around , loved it , and wanted to hire me on the show ’s writing staff .
It was a plum job and a boost to my career , and it would have never happened if not for the strike .
So I try to relax , and work on making the best of whatever develops , rather than worrying about how awful it is .
In times of crisis , such as this one , are most people able to accurately predict the outcomes of situations ?
Or do they tend toward too much optimism or too much pessimism ?
“ As someone who has taken risks in life I find it a comfort to know that even a coin weighted toward failure will sometimes land on success . ”
I do n’t think complex situations like this one can be predicted .
There are too many uncontrollable or unmeasurable factors .
Afterwards , of course , it will appear that some people had gotten it just right : since there are many people making many predictions , no doubt some of them will get it right , if only by chance .
But that does n’t mean that , if not for some unforeseen random turn , things would n’t have gone the other way .
The social historian ( and socialist ) Richard Henry Tawney , wrote , “ Historians give an appearance of inevitability … by dragging into prominence the forces which have triumphed and thrusting into the background those which they have swallowed up . ”
And the ( neo ) conservative historian Albert Wohlstetter said it this way : “ After the event , of course , a signal is always crystal clear .
We can now see what event the disaster was signaling … but before the event it is obscure and pregnant with conflicting meanings . ”
In some sense this idea is encapsulated in the cliché that “ hindsight is always 20 / 20 , ” but people often behave as if the adage were n’t true .
In government , for example , a “ should - have - known - it ” blame game is played after every tragedy .
In the case of Pearl Harbor , for example , seven committees of the United States Congress delved into discovering why the American military had missed all the “ signs ” of a coming attack .
One of the pieces of evidence cited as a harbinger recklessly ignored by the U.S. Navy was a request , intercepted and sent to the Office of Naval Intelligence in Washington , that a Japanese agent in Honolulu divide Pearl Harbor into five areas and make future reports on ships in harbor with reference to those areas .
Of special interest were battleships , destroyers and carriers , as well as information regarding the anchoring of more than one ship at a single dock .
In hindsight , that sounds ominous , but at other times similar requests had gone to Japanese agents in Panama , Vancouver , Portland and San Francisco .
[ The analysis is most famously laid out in the 1963 book , “ Pearl Harbor : Warning and Decision , ” by Roberta Wohlstetter , who was married to Albert , noted above . ]
In addition to the intelligence reports that in hindsight seem to point toward a specific attack , there is also a huge background of useless intelligence , each week bringing new reams of sometimes alarming or mysterious messages and transcripts that would later prove misleading or insignificant .
In advance of the event , you ca n’t tell one sort from the other .
It is hard to say whether people are too optimistic or too pessimistic .
That depends on the person .
But we should keep in mind that it is easy to concoct stories explaining the past , or to become confident about dubious scenarios of the future .
We should view both explanations and prophecies with skepticism .
Should emotions — despair , anger , happiness — play a part in the decisions people make in their lives ?
In other words , should our feelings matter ?
Of course our feelings matter .
But emotional decisions are usually not the best ones .
On the other hand , your emotions can affect your decisions whether you like it or not because the effects can occur on the unconscious level .
One study even showed that subjects holding a hot cup of coffee judged people differently than subjects holding a cold cup .
In my case , that effect would n’t have been unconscious , though .
I know that cold coffee makes me grumpy .
A recent news story about treating cancer told the story of one woman — a non-smoking vegetarian who exercised and had little incidence of cancer in her family — who was shocked by her cancer diagnosis .
Was her reaction — and others like it — reasonable ?
Does “ living right ” work against the odds that illness or misfortune will strike us ?
Assuming one is correct about the proper way to “ live right ” — and I ’m not convinced that a straight vegetarian diet is the healthiest — it is possible to decrease the odds of bad outcomes , but that does n’t mean they wo n’t occur .
Anything that is possible eventually will occur , which means that some healthy - living people will get cancer , and some chain smokers wo n’t .
I once read a story about a church group that was supposed to meet at a certain time .
Ten minutes after the appointed time , due to a gas leak , the church blew up .
If they had not showed up late , all 10 would have been killed .
Some see that as evidence that God was watching over them .
Others might conclude that you should always show up to church late .
All I learn from that is that it is a big country , and if you ask around enough , you ’ll hear some pretty improbable stories .
Another example , which I analyze in “ The Drunkard ’s Walk , ” is the time Roger Maris , a very good but not great player , broke Babe Ruth ’s beloved record , hitting 61 home runs in 1961 .
Maris had never came close to that output before , nor did he after .
What happened ?
We all know that players will hit a few more home runs than usual in some years , and a few less in others .
But the mathematics of chance also predicts that some years they ’ll hit a lot more , and some years a lot less .
Those large fluctuations are rare , and would n’t be record - breaking for most players , in any case .
But the historical statistics of baseball show that there were enough players with excellent , but sub-Ruthian , ability that over the years that it was probable that , by chance alone , one of them would have a single standout year in which they tie or break Ruth ’s record .
In fact , every stand - out record in any sport that has ever been analyzed has always been found to be consistent with the patterns produced by random fluctuations .
Performance over time comes mainly from talent and practice .
But achievements that stand out from an athlete ’s usual performance — hot streaks or record years — happen with patterns that match the patterns of chance .
Just wait long enough , and strange things will happen .
Can a full understanding of the probability of certain outcomes help reduce anxiety ?
For instance : would knowing the statistical frequency ( or infrequency ) of plane crashes help someone overcome a fear of flying ?
Would a smoker knowing the actual odds that he will get cancer make him less fearful of that outcome ?
In short , do we worry too much , or too little ?
My mother worries too much .
Some say I worry too little .
I guess that shows a ) that one cannot say “ we ” worry too much or too little , and b ) that whether an individual worries too much or too little is not 100 percent inherited from your mother .
I was once on a plane that experienced so much turbulence that when I looked out the window , the wings seemed to flap up and down like a bird’s .
I noticed , also , that the woman in the window seat next to me looked pale and terrified .
Personally , I took comfort in knowing how many miles planes fly through heavy turbulence without any problems at all .
So I explained to the woman how planes were designed to withstand such conditions , and told her the slim odds of anything bad happening .
When I finished , she turned away and reached for the barf bag .
Some people take solace in an understanding of their environment , others do n’t .
For me , an understanding of the role played by chance has taught me that one important factor in success is under our control : the number of at - bats , the number of chances taken , the number of opportunities seized .
As someone who has taken risks in life I find it a comfort to know that even a coin weighted toward failure will sometimes land on success .
Or , as I.B.M. pioneer Thomas Watson said , “ If you want to succeed , double your failure rate . ”

Attacking the Food Supply
Terrorists attacking our food supply is a nightmare scenario that has been given new life during the recent swine flu outbreak .
Although it seems easy to do , understanding why it has n’t happened is important .
G.R. Dalziel , at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore , has written a report chronicling every confirmed case of malicious food contamination in the world since 1950 : 365 cases in all , plus 126 additional unconfirmed cases .
What he found demonstrates the reality of terrorist food attacks .
It turns out 72 % of the food poisonings occurred at the end of the food supply chain — at home — typically by a friend , relative , neighbour , or co-worker trying to kill or injure a specific person .
A characteristic example is Heather Mook of York , who in 2007 tried to kill her husband by putting rat poison in his spaghetti .
Most of these cases resulted in fewer than five casualties —
Mook only injured her husband in this incident — although 16 % resulted in five or more .
Of the 19 cases that claimed 10 or more lives , four involved serial killers operating over several years .
Another 23 % of cases occurred at the retail or food service level .
A 1998 incident in Japan , where someone put arsenic in a curry sold at a summer festival , killing four and hospitalising 63 , is a typical example .
Only 11 % of these incidents resulted in 100 or more casualties , while 44 % resulted in none .
There are very few incidents of people contaminating the actual food supply .
People deliberately contaminated a water supply seven times , resulting in three deaths .
There is only one example of someone deliberately contaminating a crop before harvest — in Australia in 2006 — and the crops were recalled before they could be sold .
And in the three cases of someone deliberately contaminating food during packaging and distribution , including a 2005 case in the UK where glass and needles were baked into loaves of bread , no one died or was injured .
This is n’t the stuff of bioterrorism .
The closest example occurred in 1984 in the US , where members of a religious group known as the Rajneeshees contaminated several restaurant salad bars with salmonella enterica typhimurium , sickening 751 , hospitalising 45 , but killing no one .
In fact , no one knew this was malicious until a year later , when one of the perpetrators admitted it .
Almost all of the food contaminations used conventional poisons such as cyanide , drain cleaner , mercury , or weed killer .
There were nine incidents of biological agents , including salmon­ella , ricin , and faecal matter , and eight cases of radiological matter .
The 2006 London poisoning of the former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko with polonium - 210 in his tea is an example of the latter .
And that assassination illustrates the real risk of malicious food poisonings .
What is discussed in terrorist training manuals , and what the CIA is worried about , is the use of contaminated food in targeted assassinations .
The quantities involved for mass poisonings are too great , the nature of the food supply too vast and the details of any plot too complicated and unpredictable to be a real threat .
That becomes crystal clear as you read the details of the different incidents : it ’s hard to kill one person , and very hard to kill dozens .
Hundreds , thousands : it ’s just not going to happen any time soon .
The fear of bioterror is much greater , and the panic from any bioterror scare will injure more people , than bioterrorism itself .
Far more dangerous are accidental contaminations due to negligent industry practices , such as the 2006 spinach E coli and , more recently , peanut salmonella contaminations in the US , the 2008 milk contaminations in China , and the BSE - infected beef from earlier this decade .
And the systems we have in place to deal with these accidental contaminations also work to mitigate any intentional ones .
In 2004 , the then US secretary of health and human services , Tommy Thompson , said on Fox News : “ I can not understand why terrorists have not attacked our food supply .
Because it is so easy to do . ”
Guess what ?
It ’s not at all easy to do .

“ Aaaaahhh !
Welcome to Watto ’s shop , eh ?
Take a look around .
I ’ve got everything you need , eh ?
He - he - he - he - he ! ”
“ Oooh !
You wanna buy pit droids eh ?
The’ help you fix your podracer , you know . ”
“ You not find a better deal anywhere , I think .
Eh ? ”
Never buy a used droid from a greedy Toydarian ( particularly one who is such a blatant Middle Eastern stereotype ) .
Watto , the hook - nosed merchant insect from George Lucas ’ Star Wars prequel The Phantom Menace , deals in junk .
His young slave , the engineering prodigy Anakin Skywalker – you know him in later episodes as the arch villain Darth Vader – constructs the protocol droid C3PO from the wealth of surplus equipment and spare parts in Watto ’s junkyard .
George Lucas ’ vision may not be that far off .
These days robot - loving Japanese are tinkering with screwdrivers and motors instead of heading to the beach or hot springs during the holidays .
Tokyo’s major store devoted to robots , Vstone Robot Center in the bustling Akihabara electronics district , sells robots of all sizes and shapes , including the tiny scuttling Robo - Q from Tomy Co. and the Pleo animatronic dinosaur toy from Ugobe Inc. of the U.S .
Several web sites today specialize in used robots and robotic parts , advertising “ late model low hour equipment . ”
These are mainly leftover industrial robots – by companies such as Motoman , Fanuc , Panasonic , and OTC Daihen – used in manufacturing goods such as automobiles .
Like their human counterparts , these droids find themselves laid off .
You can find a wealth of robot kits and parts on the Internet , as well as pre-assembled robots including a working model of C3 PO ’s famous companion R2 - D2 .
Hasbro ’s Industrial Automation claims to be “ One of the largest droid manufacturing corporations in the galaxy . ”
It offers models of “ the popular MD - series of medical droids and the R- series of astromech droids . ”
George Lucas ’ R2 - D2 is introduced in the Star Wars prequel as a droid belonging to the Royal House of Naboo and the Royal Naboo Starfighter Corps .
R2 - D2 ’s characteristic chirp – and ability to repair or infiltrate any starship episode - after - episode – endears him to Star Wars fans .
Hasbro ’s R2 - D2 is starting to look more and more like its movie namesake :
Sonar Navigational System
Sonar Navigational System Rotating Dome
Illuminating Light Beam
Adaptable Droid Mood Status Indicator
Sound Processing Microphones
Voice Recognition Response Module
Utility Arm Beverage Holder
Motorized Indoor Terrain Treads .
If you want something a bit more practical , in addition to their widely known cleaning robots like the Roomba Vacuum Cleaning Robot , iRobot offers the Scooba Floor Washing Robot , and a very primitive early version of a C3PO - like “ virtual visiting ” communication robot that connects to the Internet and roams around your house visiting whomever you want while you ’re traveling on business .
You can buy these robots from Amazon or Best Buy .
Carl ’s Electronics , the Fast Eddies of robot kits , is a web - based robotics storehouse .
Robotics kits for beginners range from Solar Hopping Frogs , Mini Spiders , and alien - like Hydrazoids to programmables such as Robotic Arms , LEGO MINDSTORMS , combat platforms , and Bioloid humanoid robots .
The kits range from the simple to the complex .
Solar Hopping Frogs –
When this little guy sees the sun or bright light he jumps for joy using his hind legs and rubber feet .
This mini solar powered robot kit is fun to build and play with .
Demonstrates how the sun can provide alternative power to a DC motor – no batteries required !
Mini Spiders –
An eight - legged solar patroller !
This sun-powered arachnid has a great " crab - like " walking motion .
Demonstrates the principles of solar power in a fun and easy - to - understand way .
Hydrazoids –
The HYDRAZOID robot kit will react to sound impulses such as clapping of hands and move forward for 15 seconds and then stop to await another sound command .
LEDs and illuminated fiber optic antennas give the Hydrazoid a cool alien appearance .
Robotic Arm –
The ROBOTIC ARM TRAINER teaches the basic robotic sensing and locomotion principles , testing your motor skills , as you build and control the Arm .
You can command this unit with its five - switch wired controller with corresponding lights to grab , release , lift , lower , rotate wrist and pilot sideways 350 degrees .
Bioloid – The Bioloid Multi - bot is the first robot of its kind to be built around serially controlled servo technology .
This allows the user to construct a wide variety of robot configurations , including the autonomous exploration robot , quadruped puppy robot , hexapod spider robot , dinosaur robot and bi-pedal humanoid – all with one controller board .
LEGO MINDSTORMS is in a class all by itself .
MINDSTORMS originated from the programmable LEGO sensor blocks used for educational toys .
LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT – the next generation – is a programmable robotics kit released by Lego in July 2006 .
The kit includes 519 LEGO pieces , three servo motors , four sensors ( ultrasonic , sound , touch , and light ) , seven wires , a USB cable , a USB Bluetooth dongle , and the programmable NXT computer brick .
To program the NXT brick , you use the LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT Software .
This development engine is powered by NI LabVIEW , “ intuitive graphical programming software used by scientists and engineers worldwide to design , control and test consumer products and systems such as MP3 and DVD players , cell phones , and vehicle air bag safety systems . ”
Applications include controllers used in NASA Mars Pathfinder exploration as well as Microsoft Xbox testing .
Building LEGO droids is now a sport .
The FIRST LEGO League ( FLL ) is a robotics tournament for children ages 9 - 14 that combines “ hands - on , minds - on challenges with a sports - like atmosphere using the LEGO MINDSTORMS Technology . ”
Participants learn that “ friendly competition and mutual gain are not separate goals ” , and that “ helping one another is the foundation of teamwork . ”
FFL participants are likely candidates to participate in MIT robot competitions when they are college age – these include LEGO tournaments along with humanoid robot competitions .
The students work in teams of two or three .
Each team is given the same kit containing various sensors , electronic components , batteries , motors , and LEGO blocks .
It ’s quite entertaining to watch LEGO robots on YouTube shuffle a ball around a table and try to score points against each other .
You may not be able to piece together a droid as sophisticated as C3PO – at least , quite yet .
The most sophisticated robots today are guided by narrow AI software and require highly specialized skills to manufacture .
“ They can now pick up and peel bananas , land jumbo jets , steer cars through city traffic , search human DNA for cancer genes , play soccer or the violin , find earthquake victims or explore craters on Mars . ”
The question of whether robots will ever act and respond like humans – using artificial general intelligence or AGI – is somewhat controversial .
There are those such as Harvard cognitive scientist Steven Pinker , Intel co-founder Gordon Moore , and software entrepreneur and executive Mitch Kapor who doubt that a robot can ever successfully fool a human into thinking that it is a fellow human ( the Turing Test ) .
Ray Kurzweil is more optimistic – he predicts that robots will match human intelligence by 2029 , only 20 years from now .
It will be interesting to see if competitive young teams of LEGO robot builders – using the latest AI software to program droids – contribute in making this prediction a reality .
The future may lie somewhere between the naysayers and the optimists .
Intel CEO Justin Rattner predicts that it will take at least until 2050 to close the mental gap between people and machines .
Maybe then you ’ll be able to build human - acting droids like C3PO and R2 - D2 from spare parts .
The meeting took place during a moonless night on a hillside on the edge of South Waziristan .
Baitullah Mehsud , the self - appointed emir of the Pakistani Taliban , lay on a shawl spread over the rocky ground , sipping tea from a flask .
His face - fleshy and bearded - was visible only by the light from mobile phones and torches .
Kalashnikov - wielding gunmen stood guard ; a pair of local doctors crouched nearby .
Opposite him sat tribal elders from a neighbouring area , whom Mehsud had called for the meeting .
He laid out his agenda , a plan to flood the area with Taliban soldiers to attack the pillars of the state - police , health workers , teachers , soldiers .
" I am at war with the government , " one of those present recalled him saying .
The most memorable thing , one elder said later , was how ordinary Mehsud looked .
" You would have difficulty picking him out of a group , " he said .
That style belies one of the most feared figures in Pakistan , and now the globe .
So who is Baitullah Mehsud ?
Ten days ago the US slapped a $ 5 m reward on his head , elevating him , in bounty terms , to the rank of a senior al - Qaida leader .
Since February , CIA drones have concentrated their missiles on Mehsud 's mountainous demesne .
On Monday , he responded in the way he knows best .
A gang of tribal gunmen stormed a poorly defended police training centre in Lahore , killing eight cadets .
Claiming responsibility , Mehsud said the assault was in retaliation for the Predator strikes .
The next attack , he threatened , would be in the heart of American power .
" Not in Afghanistan , but in Washington , which will amaze the entire world , " he said .
Although US General David Petraeus said he was " galvanised " by the claim , few analysts take it seriously .
Where Mehsud poses a very real danger is in Pakistan .
Last night a suicide bomber struck a paramilitary camp in the heart of Islamabad , killing eight Frontier Corps soldiers and injuring at least four more .
The attacker struck under cover of darkness , sneaking into the camp on the side of a main road , close to a major shopping area , and blowing himself up .
Two other attackers managed to flee the scene , television stations reported .
There was no claim of responsibility but early suspicions fell on Mehsud .
Earlier in the day , Mehsud had claimed responsibility for a shooting at a US immigration centre in New York in which a gunman killed 13 people , saying it was revenge for American drone attacks in Pakistan .
Most analysts wrote the claim off as a publicity stunt .
Few have done as much to destabilise the nuclear - armed nation of 170 million people over the past two years as this 39 - year - old former gym enthusiast and border brigand .
As leader of Tehrik - i- Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) , he controls the largest Taliban group , with influence that spans the tribal belt and extends into Swat , the tranquil tourist destination now in the hands of gunmen .
Mehsud 's rise is the result of several innovations .
One is suicide bombing , a tactic unheard of in Pakistan until two years ago .
Last year his fighters killed an estimated 2,000 people - soldiers , police officers , suspected spies and innocent bystanders .
Some were beheaded ; most died in suicide blasts .
The cannon fodder are young , impressionable boys and men , mostly from poor families .
They are trained by Qari Hussain , Mehsud 's right - hand man , who was once part of Sipa Sahaba , a murderous sectarian outfit that specialises in slaughtering Shias .
Tall , imposing and generally quiet , one journalist described Hussain as " one of the most frightening people I 've met " .
But Mehsud 's greatest achievement has been to revitalise Pakistan 's jihadist network .
He has brought together disparate groups of Pashtun warlords , jihadi fighters from Punjab and al - Qaida fugitives from across the Muslim world .
This fusion of cash , cadres and organisation has given him the means to strike anywhere in Pakistan .
Although uneducated , Mehsud is said to be focused , intelligent and quietly charismatic .
" There 's a sense of strength and energy about him , " said Shoaib Hasan , a BBC reporter who met Mehsud in Waziristan .
" And he has a charisma .
When he talks , his people listen . "
According to a senior Pakistani intelligence official , Mehsud was born in 1970 and spent the latter part of the 1980s fighting the Russians in Afghanistan .
In the 1990s he battled alongside the Taliban militias as they swept into Kabul .
He shot to prominence in 2004 , filling the vacuum left by the death of Nek Muhammad , a Wazir commander killed by a US Predator drone .
He exploited the Pakistan army 's weakness for peace deals .
A February 2005 agreement brought a halt to fighting and a donation of more than $ 500,000 in taxpayer money .
By the time it collapsed , Mehsud had reorganised his militia , now thought to number more than 2,000 in South Waziristan alone .
In 2007 he humiliated the army by kidnapping more than 200 soldiers , who were later released in exchange for 25 Taliban prisoners - except for three Shia soldiers beheaded on video .
He also strengthened ties with al - Qaida fighters .
Pakistani officials said between 1,000 and 1,200 Uzbek fighters live in Waziristan , most on Mehsud turf .
But Mehsud has his rivals : Maulvi Nazir , who controls the plains and lower hills of South Waziristan , and Hafiz Gul Bahadur in North Waziristan .
They are divided by turf , tribe and foreign affiliations .
But since February the three have formed an alliance , the United Mujahideen Council , presumably to greet the arrival of 21,000 more US troops in Afghanistan later this year .
The UMC is co-ordinated by Sirajuddin Haqqani , an Afghan warlord with strong influence in North Waziristan .
Haqqani also carries a $ 5 m US bounty on his head .
The other open question is Mehsud 's links with Pakistani intelligence .
For months , US officials have complained of links with the Taliban .
" Mehsud is definitely an ally of some elements in the establishment , " said analyst Khaled Ahmed .
" And that includes the army . "
Intelligence officials insist they have been pushing America to attack Mehsud .
But , they argue , the root cause of the trouble is the US presence in Afghanistan .
" If we settle that , what happens in the tribal areas of Pakistan will stop , " said one .
The other factor is the ambivalence of Pakistani public opinion towards Mehsud .
Last Monday 's Lahore attack may galvanise opinion against him .
Until now , Pakistanis have been prone to conspiracy theories about " foreign hands " - usually Indian , but also CIA and Mossad - in terror attacks over the past two years .
Now , said Ahmed , Pakistanis are faced with the enemy in their midst .
" People have not yet been associating him with terrorism so far south .
This is the first time he has owned up , " he said .
• An American UN worker abducted more than two months ago turned up unharmed last night , lying alongside a road in western Pakistan with his hands and feet bound .
John Solecki was discovered in a village 30 miles south of Quetta , where he headed the UN refugee agency 's operations .
The Taliban heartland
• The Pakistani Taliban are distinct from , but related to , the Taliban movement that ruled Afghanistan from 1996 until 2001 under Mullah Muhammad Omar .
The largest group , Baitullah Mehsud 's Tehrik - i- Taliban Pakistan , emerged from South Waziristan after 2005 .
It has seized control of a large swath of the tribal belt and part of North West Frontier province .
Suicide bombings , beheadings and kidnapping are its signature tactics .
• The TTP 's stated aim is to overthrow the Pakistani state , although some militants also fight in Afghanistan .
The next two most important groups , led by Hafiz Gul Bahadur and Maulvi Nazir , are based along the border and focused almost exclusively on sending militants to fight in Afghanistan .
• These three groups have traditionally been rivals , but under orders from Omar they shelved their differences to form the United Mujahideen Council , which aims to counter the US troop surge ordered by US president Barack Obama .
• Meanwhile the original Taliban operates from havens in the adjoining province of Baluchistan .
The contempt you show php programmers and website owners amazes me .
You change usages and drop tags like you are the only users of php .
You Create shedloads of work when you do that .
One can forget developing Anything if using php as one spends too much time reprogramming existing Items to keep up with your constant changes .
Can you kindly ask all the idiots that engineer php if they would be willing
To do that work for free or if they will pay for programmers to do it in Compensation for their utter stupidity and arrogance and the contempt they Show to their users ?
Why cant you make every release backwardly compatible ?
The time is coming when a law suit beckons because as sure as eggs is eggs , A lot of your users will grow tired of paying out the thousands of dollars
You cost them with every new php release , ( theres a growing band who are Already tired of it ) and will sue .
And they will win .
And it will cost you Millions .

City homeowners could soon be Googling their power use .
Toronto Hydro has become the first Canadian utility — and one of eight worldwide — to test drive a new Web - based energy management tool developed by Internet search giant Google Inc .
Called Google PowerMeter , the software allows homeowners to see their daily electricity use on a personalized iGoogle home page , along with weather forecasts , news updates and horoscopes .
Google collects the data from utilities that have installed smart meters outside customer homes .
" Everybody uses electricity but not many people stop to think of the impact of that use and how we can be more responsible with our usage , " said Kirsten Olsen Cahill , a program manager at Google .
" Our goal here is to get that information into the hands of users in a way that helps them make smart choices . "
Toronto Hydro - Electric
System has installed more than 600,000 residential smart meters throughout the city .
The first 10,000 of those customers were switched last week to time - of - use pricing , meaning they are charged a premium for power used during peak times and offered a discount during off - peak times .
Google , which argues you can't improve what you can't measure , says it wants to make it easier for power consumers to manage their kilowatt - hours .
Toronto Hydro said today the pilot is limited to a select group of customers — less than 1,000 — and will last a few months .
" If successful , Toronto Hydro and Google will then offer the PowerMeter to all Toronto Hydro customers . "
Tanya Bruckmueller , a spokesperson for the utility , said the software will initially provide only previous - day usage data .
" The intention is to move toward real time , " she said , adding that customers will have the option of getting more detailed information directly from Toronto Hydro 's own Web site .
Google , which first unveiled its PowerMeter tool in February , has also partnered with six utilities in the United States , including TXU Energy in Texas and San Diego Gas & Electric in California , and one from India .
The search giant 's interest in energy management is one of the biggest signs yet that the coming " smart grid " will rely heavily on computer and Internet technologies , a trend that high - tech giants Cisco Systems and IBM have also eagerly embraced .
Likewise , Bell Canada , AT&T and U.S. cable giant Comcast are among the large communications providers growing interested in energy management and smart grid services , based on the belief that broadband networks will play a crucial role .
Cahill said Google 's plan is to open up the data it collects to other software developers , similar to how many mapping services today are built on top of Google Maps .
" The most important thing to us is to get the data that utilities are collecting through their smart meters back to users , " she said .
Richard
Oh , president of Toronto - based energy management venture Lixar SRS , said he sees Google as more of a partner than a competitor in the market .
" Google is not only making it easier to access information , they are enabling companies like ours to provide advanced services and tools that build on that data to help the consumer save on energy , " he said .

They 're all betting that homeowners , faced with rising energy prices , will increasingly manage their household energy use just like they manage their finances online , sell items on Craiglist , and keep track of friends and family on social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter .
Top Children ’s Movies of All - Time
I recently began doing research on a list of the top children ’s movies ever made .
I ’d hoped to be able to compile a list of 100 great movies you can watch with any age child and not have to explain anything to do with sex , cover their eyes during graphic violence or explain ideas that are well over their heads .
The first thing I discovered is that there really are n’t that many resources for this type of list and no one seems to ever have been able to come up with 100 movies that you could watch with both a 4 - year - old and a nine - year - old .
I fairly quickly assessed that my list would have to be considerably shorter .
Perhaps 50 films .
In reality , fewer films
.
Many lists included films that I believe everyone should see at some point in their lives but I did n’t feel were even remotely appropriate for or interesting to children .
Some of the truly wonderful animated films that were included in other lists I simply have found too complicated for younger children to understand and , in some cases , too frightening .
Many included movies that would be terrific for your pre-teen and teenaged children , but not for younger children .
What I was looking for were those films that your family could pop into the DVD player on Friday evening and watch as a family .
Eventually , I put together a list of 45 films that you can all watch together .
Disney is , of course , heavily represented , mostly because they are the only studio that has been putting out movies for children for as long as they have .
Many are classics , some are new , some are foreign ( but no subtitles are needed ) , many are animated , and some are part of a series .
I have not attempted to rank the movies ; I ’ll let you do that on your own .

WASHINGTON , May 11 ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Monday welcomed as a “ humanitarian gesture ” Iran ’s release of U.S. - born journalist Roxana Saberi , who had been jailed on spying charges .
“ He was relieved to see that Roxana Saberi has been released , ” White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said at a news conference .
“ We know this has been a trying time for her family and friends and he looks forward to welcoming her home to the United States .
We want to continue to stress that she was wrongly accused , but we welcome this humanitarian gesture . ”
National broadband maps of OECD countries
The coverage of broadband service is mapped by access technologies such as DSL , fibre , cable and wireless in addition to speed tiers ( e.g. 1 Mbit /s to 1.5 Mbit /s , second lowest speed tier of less than 10 - 20 Mbit/s , mid-speed tier of less than 50 Mbit/s , etc. ) .
Information on service providers such as names or links to them for each of the smallest geographical units is also provided .
It is therefore possible to consult which technologies are used for broadband access and how much speed is provided in a location along with names of service providers if a detailed interactive map has been established in the country .

Mr. Kerlikowske 's comments are a signal that the Obama administration is set to follow a more moderate -- and likely more controversial -- stance on the nation 's drug problems .
Prior administrations talked about pushing treatment and reducing demand while continuing to focus primarily on a tough criminal - justice approach .
Yesterday 's Wall Street Journal interview with new drug czar Gil Kerlikowske is generating discussion due to Kerlikowske 's statement that we must move beyond the " war on drugs " analogy .
But Gary Fields 's piece also included a dubious assumption that should n’t escape notice :
This is controversial ?
There is no evidence of that .
In fact , everywhere you look , you 'll see a changing political climate with regards to drug policy : 1. Obama made repeated statements in favor of various drug policy reforms on the campaign trail , including support for medical marijuana , treatment over incarceration , needle exchange , and fixing the crack / cocaine sentencing disparity .
In a hard - fought campaign , these were among his least controversial positions .
2. Support for legalizing marijuana is surging in America , currently polling as high as 52 % .
Since taking office , Obama 's biggest controversy with regards to drug policy was his statement in opposition to legalizing marijuana .
3 .
A recent Zogby poll found that 76 % of Americans believe the war on drugs has failed .
This view was held by a majority of Democrats , Republicans , and independents .
The idea that there 's anything controversial about moving towards a more moderate drug policy is just false on its face .
The opposite is true .
Americans are tired of the " tough criminal justice approach " and they elected a president who said he'd bring a new perspective to this issue .
If anything , it would have made more sense to say these policy shifts will most likely make our drug policy less controversial .
Certainly , that 's what Kerlikowske expects by making these conciliatory remarks .
He 's pandering to the growing public sentiment that the drug war is getting out of hand .
Seriously , why on earth would anyone expect controversy over this ?
To the contrary , people find it reassuring , which is exactly why the White House is framing it this way .
I thought that was obvious .
Thus , with this one seemingly harmless quip , " likely more controversial , " the WSJ ends up missing the entire point of the story and utterly misdiagnosing what Kerlikowske represents .
Public attitudes about the war on drugs are changing , thereby forcing our political leadership to begin implementing certain popular reforms while generally reframing the entire issue .
Any questions ?
Child Born with Second Penis in the Middle of His Back
Fetus in Fetu ( FIF ) is a rare and very mysterious medical condition that is said to have occurred ( or at least is recorded to have occurred ) less than ninety times throughout medical history .
For the little boy born in Tianjin ’s Children Hospital in China , the second penis in the middle of his tiny back is a medical first and even weirder than some other instances of this highly unusual phenomenon .
The baby presented no problems when it came into the world with the help of midwives on May 27 , 2008 , at the Hejian Maternity Center , which is part of Tianjin Children ’s Hospital .
What seemed like a routine birth , however , soon turned into a story from Ripley ’s Believe it or Not , as midwives and medical staff could not have been more surprised to see a little boy endowed with a second penis in the middle of his back .
Born to farmer dad , Li Jun , 30 , and his wife , who live in Central China ’s Henan Province , the extra penis was safely removed .
There are complicated theories about this condition that relate to the abnormal formation of twins in utero ( parasitic twin theory ) , but this manifestation is just too weird for any of the medical books .
For now , doctors are content to say that after three hours of surgery , the extra penis is gone and the little boy is doing fine .

MILLTOWN
INEZ WILSON thought she was doing a good deed recently when she put some old jeans and sweat shirts into one of the many clothing bins in the parking lot of the East Mill Shopping Center in Milltown .
Ms. Wilson intended to give her clothes to a charity , hoping they would go to someone who needed them .
Instead , she may have done nothing more than make a few dollars for a business that sells used clothing for profit in third - world countries .
The practice of used clothing businesses posing as charities has become so widespread that New Jersey lawmakers passed a law that went into effect earlier this year allowing municipalities to license and regulate bin operators .
“ It would bother me a lot if these clothes were n’t going to help people who need clothes , ” Ms. Wilson , a New Brunswick resident , said after hearing about the new law .
“ Giving clothes to someone who is going to sell them is not what I had in mind . ”
The bill ’s sponsors included Assemblyman Paul D. Moriarty , a Gloucester Democrat , who said he was inspired after reading in a magazine how many bins were operated not by reputable charities but by businesses .
Often the businesses , Mr. Moriarty said , use deceptive signs and wording on the bins to try to persuade people the clothes will be used to help the needy .
EVER since they started pumping water for their vines , the winegrowers of Langhorne Creek have learnt to cope with crises .
But none as grave as the one they face now .
Their water source at the mouth of the Murray River , in South Australia , has turned salty .
Adelaide , the state capital 55 km ( 34 miles ) away , has been told its water supply from the Murray can no longer be guaranteed .
The Murray Darling Basin Authority , a new body charged with saving Australia 's biggest river system from expiring , has its work cut out .
Early last month Rob Freeman , the authority 's boss , delivered grim news .
The volume of water flowing into the Murray and its main tributary , the Darling , between January and March was the lowest in 117 years .
The three - year volume up to March was the driest ever .
Mr Freeman told Adelaide 's 1 m people this meant that not enough water might be conveyed down the Murray to meet their “ critical human needs ” next year .
Just 17 years ago , Adelaide relied on the Murray for only 10 % of its water : regular rains filling dams in the city 's hills provided the rest .
Now , it depends on the Murray for 90 % .
Climate change and Australia 's worst drought in a century are partly to blame .
But the river system that covers two - thirds of Australia 's irrigated farming land is also suffering from decades of overuse .
South Australians feel this with growing bitterness .
They are at the end of the line in a system that starts about 2,700 km north .
The more populous states of Queensland and New South Wales ( NSW ) comprise four - fifths of the basin's area .
Farmers , especially cotton and rice growers in those upstream states , account for 83 % of the basin 's consumed water .
The impact of all this has left the Murray 's mouth near Langhorne Creek close to ruin .
The wine region 's first water came from an ancient aquifer .
Too much pumping forced the authorities in the early 1990s to switch water licences to the Murray , 10 km away at Alexandrina , one of two lakes at the mouth facing the Southern Ocean .
Plenty of water then flowed through the basin to keep the lakes fresh .
Langhorne Creek 's wineries boomed .
A crunch came last year .
The flows stopped , and Alexandrina 's level has dropped 1.5 metres .
Its water is now too saline to use .
The authorities are now pondering the harsh step of building a weir at nearby Wellington to stop the salt water moving back into the Murray itself .
Experts predict this would in effect destroy the lakes and their surrounding freshwater wetlands .
Penny Wong , the federal minister for climate change and water , says the “ unfortunate reality ” of the flow figures means the option must be kept as a “ last resort ” .
Growers at Langhorne Creek and nearby Currency Creek , meanwhile , have formed a company to build a pipeline to secure their water from a cleaner point on the Murray further east .
They may yet survive .
Australia 's interstate water - trading scheme has allowed the state to buy water from distant farmers in NSW , who have switched to less thirsty crops , and keep it in store for Adelaide .
Mr Freeman 's body , launched by Canberra late last year , is the first with power to manage the entire river system , overriding rivalries between the four basin states , so that calamities such as Lake Alexandrina 's do n't happen .
Unless drought - breaking rains come , that will be a tough ask .
Craig Willson , proprietor of Bremerton winery at Langhorne Creek , and a director of its pipeline company , reckons drought and loss of the lake 's water have cut the region 's productivity by almost 40 % over the past two years .
“ Even so , we 're surprised at how well some vines survive using less water , ” he says .
Applied to growers of other crops , the same lesson may help save the Murray .
( CNN ) -- Admitted fraudster Bernard Madoff , the mastermind of history 's biggest Ponzi scheme , met with the Securities and Exchange Commission 's top watchdog this week , several knowledgeable sources told CNN .
Disgraced financier Bernard Madoff arrives at court on March 12 , where he pleaded guilty to 11 counts of fraud .
The three - hour session took place Wednesday at New York 's Metropolitan Correctional Center , where Madoff is awaiting sentencing on federal fraud charges , the sources said .
He met with SEC Inspector - General David Kotz , who is investigating what federal securities regulators knew about Madoff's $ 50 billion enterprise before it collapsed in December .
" We 've been making substantial progress in the investigation and plan to issue a comprehensive report very shortly , " Kotz said when asked about the meeting , without elaborating .
He told a congressional committee earlier this week that his main report should be complete by the end of August .
Madoff , 70 , pleaded guilty in March to 11 criminal counts , including fraud , money laundering and perjury .
The onetime chairman of the NASDAQ stock exchange faces a potential 150 - year prison term at his June 29 sentencing .
His attorney , Ira Sorkin , had no comment on the report Thursday .
Madoff 's operation reached far and wide , touching major financial institutions overseas , including Spain 's Banco Santander and Britain 's HSBC , tony communities such as Palm Beach , Florida , and members of Hollywood 's elite , such as film director Steven Spielberg and actor Kevin Bacon .
Kotz is looking into whether the SEC missed or ignored warning signs before Madoff 's enterprise collapsed .
His office so far has interviewed more than 100 witnesses and has reviewed millions of e-mails and other documents , he told Rep.
Paul Kanjorski , the chairman of a House subcommittee that oversees the securities industry , in a June 15 letter .
Chris Cox , the SEC chairman at the time the scandal broke , resigned under fire in January after disclosing the agency had ignored warnings about Madoff dating back to 1999 .
Harry Markopolos , a Boston accountant , told Kanjorski's subcommittee in February that he repeatedly tried to raise questions about Madoff with the SEC .
" I gift - wrapped and delivered the largest Ponzi scheme in history to them and somehow they could n't be bothered to conduct a thorough and proper investigation , " Markopolos said .
Documents filed in court by Madoff 's lawyers estimated his worth at up to $ 826 million and his business at $ 700 million .
A 162 - page list presented in court named thousands of victims bilked by Madoff .
The list included multinational banks , unions , charitable foundations , Madoff 's attorney , Madoff 's relatives and celebrities .
Other notable names and foundations on the list included Columbia University , the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 1249 Pension Fund , The Elie Wiesel Foundation , John Denver Enterprises and Fred Wilpon , the owner of the New York Mets .

Former Australian intelligence officer faces jail over Bali bombing documents
By Mike Head
5 May 2009
A former Australian intelligence official and his co-tenant face up to two years jail after being convicted last month of leaking classified documents relating to the October 2002 terrorist bomb blasts on the Indonesian resort island of Bali .
The outcome of the little - reported trial raises critical questions about the former Howard government ’s failure to warn Australian tourists that Bali was a terrorist target and about the current Rudd government ’s prosecution of the two alleged whistleblowers .
On the night of October 12 , 2002 , thousands of holiday - makers from Australia and other countries were in Bali ’s Kuta nightclub district when the bombings killed 200 innocent people , including 88 Australians and 40 Indonesians , mostly nightclub workers and taxi drivers .
Travel advisories issued by the Howard government had assured the Australian public that Bali was “ calm ” and tourist services “ normal , ” despite a heightened terrorist risk produced by Australia ’s participation in the US - led invasion of Afghanistan .
After a two - week trial in the ACT Supreme Court last week , ex-Australian Security Intelligence Organisation ( ASIO ) officer James Sievers was found guilty of communicating information he had obtained as an ASIO employee , and his former housemate Francis O’Ryan was convicted of aiding and abetting him .
Sievers and O’Ryan were convicted of sending to the Australian newspaper in October 2004 three ASIO documents showing that Australian authorities were warned by their US intelligence partners two weeks before the Bali bombings that an Al Qaeda - linked group was planning attacks on “ sin spots ” and “ nightclubs ” .
The two men are currently on bail , awaiting sentence on June 3 .
The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions ( DPP ) has argued that both men must be jailed .
Section 18 ( 2 ) of the ASIO
Act specifies punishment of imprisonment for two years .
Sievers is the first ASIO officer to be charged under the section , which is designed to help shield the domestic spy agency from public scrutiny .
The Rudd Labor government , through the DPP , sought and obtained a re-trial after a jury last May failed to reach a verdict despite 13 hours of deliberations .
Prosecutors alleged that Sievers , who had access to the documents during a 2004 Senate inquiry into the bombings , passed them to O’Ryan , who posted them to the Australian ’s Sydney offices .
O’Ryan was said to have written on two of the documents , “ please see details of prior intelligence through which a tragedy might have been prevented ” and “ sin spots - nightclubs ” .
According to the documents , US intelligence agencies told their Australian counterparts that Jemaah Islamiah ( JI ) spiritual leader Abu Bakar Bashir headed a group called Majeklis Mujahedden Indonesia that was preparing large - scale bombings .
Right up until the bombing , the Howard government insisted it was safe to visit Bali , despite receiving explicit warnings from US intelligence agencies , as well as its own Office of National Assessments ( ONA ) , which had identified Bali as a potential terrorist target at least three times , including in a briefing to then Foreign Minister Alexander Downer .
ASIO itself advised Qantas , the main airline servicing Bali from Australia , that given the JI presence in Indonesia , Bali could not be “ considered exempt from attack ” .
On the basis of reports by ASIO and the Defence Intelligence Organisation ( DIO ) , the Defence Security Agency issued a “ high ” threat assessment to all military personnel traveling to Indonesia .
As a result of these warnings , Qantas crew members and diplomats were instructed to avoid well - known hotels , bars and nightclubs in Bali .
When the documents were published , they re-ignited public anger over the failure of the Howard government and the intelligence agencies to alert travellers and try to prevent the bombings .
In the days after the atrocity , then Prime Minister Howard initially denied receiving any prior warning of the likelihood of such an attack .
But when the Washington Post reported that the CIA had identified threats to attack a tourist site in Indonesia , mentioning Bali , Howard was forced to change his story on the floor of parliament , while still claiming that the CIA ’s information was only of a “ general ” character .
The leaked documents also threw into doubt the findings of an inquiry that Howard was hastily forced to organise , by the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security ( IGIS ) , as well as a subsequent report by a Senate committee — both of which denied that the government and the agencies had received any specific warnings about attacks being prepared in Bali .
In an attempt to deflect attention from the serious questions raised by the classified documents about his own government ’s role , the Howard government instigated a police operation to find the “ leakers ” .
Australian Federal Police raided the Australian ’s offices and eventually produced evidence that O’Ryan ’s credit card had been used to purchase the post office envelope that contained the damning documents .
During the second trial , O’Ryan admitted sending the material , saying he was motivated by anger over the government ’s failure to act on the Bali warnings .
The Labor government , however , was just as determined as Howard to secure convictions .
Crown prosecutor Stephen Hall SC told the jury to disregard any thoughts about whether there was a “ noble reason ” for the documents being leaked .
Sievers was also convicted , although both men denied that he was involved and there was no direct evidence of any such involvement .
A number of questions remain unanswered .
Why did the Howard government pursue the case so relentlessly ?
What was so sensitive about the Bali documents ?
Why did Howard want them suppressed ?
And why has the Labor government fought for convictions in the case as well ?
The leaked documents demonstrated that the Howard governments and its intelligence advisers were well aware that Australia ’s participation in the war on Afghanistan had made Australians , and Bali , targets for Islamic extremists .
Did the government deliberately choose to ignore the warnings of some kind of terrorist attack in Bali in order to politically exploit the outcome ?
Howard certainly seized upon the Bali events , which he dubbed Australia ’s own “ September 11 , ” to intensify the phoney “ war on terror ” both at home and abroad .
Together with the fabrications about “ weapons of mass destruction , ” the Bali tragedy was repeatedly cited by Howard as a reason for his government ’s participation in the 2003 US - led invasion of Iraq , which was soon followed by the deployment of troops to Solomon Islands .
The real goal of these interventions , including the war in Afghanistan , was not to combat terrorism or protect ordinary people from violent attacks .
It was to secure US domination of the resource - rich Middle East and Central Asia , against its rivals , particularly in Europe and China , with Australia acting as a junior partner in exchange for US support for Canberra ’s own neo-colonial activities in the Pacific .
Domestically , the Bali tragedy was utilised to overcome popular opposition to the introduction of unprecedented “ anti- terrorism ” legislation that dismantled basic legal and democratic rights .
The first wave of laws , passed in 2002 , defined terrorism so broadly that it could cover political dissent , make terrorist offences punishable by life imprisonment and give the government power to outlaw organisations .
Another provision , giving ASIO powers to secretly interrogate and detain people without charge or trial , foundered , due to widespread opposition .
Largely as a result of the Bali bombing , however , this provision , along with other draconian measures was pushed through by mid-2003 , with Labor ’s support .
More legislation followed over the next three years , establishing three other forms of detention without trial , creating executive powers to proscribe groups , and allowing for semi-secret trials .
The Rudd government ’s pursuit of Sievers and O’Ryan — whose only “ offence ” was to try to alert the public about what the political and security establishment knew in advance about the Bali bombings — serves to highlight Labor ’s bipartisan support for both the Bali cover - up , and Howard ’s anti-terror laws .
Labor is determined to protect Howard and his ministers from any accountability over Bali because the affair raises too many questions about the lies and cover-ups that have dominated every aspect of the “ war on terror ” , including the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq .
The Labor leadership backed all the fabrications and bears equal responsibility with the Howard government for the crimes committed , and the lives lost , as a result .
Any re-opening of the Bali issue raises the danger that it will expose Labor ’s complicity in the political exploitation of the bombings , and poses the question of whether the Labor leadership , including Rudd himself ( who was Labor ’s foreign affairs spokesman in 2002 ) , was given any forewarning of a possible Bali attack .

More evidence of Australian government ’s failure to warn of Bali bombings
[ 15 May 2004 ]
The more you look at legislation in this country , the nastier an opinion you develop about it .
You ’d be able to forgive minor errors , small awkwardnesses , even larger problems so long as the common good was served , but the more I look at statute law in Ireland and more critically , at how it is drafted , the less charitable I feel about the drafters .
Much of the stuff I see , I see through the Firearms Acts – that stuff I talk about elsewhere .
This time , though , it ’s more apropos to here .
The new Broadcasting Bill 2009 , currently on it ’s last stages in the Oireachtas and about to become the Broadcasting Act 2009 , has a lovely little sting in it .
In section 140 ( the definitions ) , it defines “ television set ” to mean :
any electronic apparatus capable of receiving and exhibiting television broadcasting services broadcast for general reception ( whether or not its use for that purpose is dependent on the use of anything else in conjunction with it ) and any software or assembly comprising such apparatus and other apparatus ;
Nice little bit there .
What it basicly means is that if you have no TV and you watch Youtube over your broadband connection ( or download video footage and watch that ) , then you need to have a TV licence .
Yeah , that ’s a bit of a surprise , is n’t it ?
We ’ve the worst broadband rollout in the EU , in a nation where we prided ourselves on being the gateway to the EU for IT companies , where we have fancy plans for rolling out high - speed broadband to every sheep farmer in Mayo ( and wireless broadband for their iPhones while they ’re out with the sheep ) ; and now we ’re charging a 160 euro tax for those who opt to have broadband installed .
You would n’t mind if there was some ethical claim they could use to justify the tax .
Maybe , like the TV licence , we ’re using what is , notionally at least , a national resource ( like the electromagnetic spectrum , or the airways , or the roads or whatever ) .
Except that we ’re sourcing our broadband from private companies over private telecomms nets ( the national infrastructure was sold off to private investors during Eircom ’s IPO ) .
So there ’s no national resource in use .
Maybe we need the RTE site to get content ?
Except that , well , RTE does n’t broadcast anything other than news on their site and even that wo n’t work for Ubuntu or Debian linux thanks to dodgy flash players .
Plus , opting out of RTE is n’t possible as it ’s pushed out there and the claim then is that if you can receive it ( which I could – I just have to reinstall a different proprietary OS on my machine for a few hundred euro ) then you have to pay the licence fee .
And what about the rise of mobile broadband ?
You can watch youtube on your iPhone , so now you need an iLicence as well ?
Legally you would .
So the medium is n’t a natural resource , its provision is done purely as a private business affair , and there ’s no provision of content involved .
So how in the name of little blue apples does Eamon Ryan think that he has some sort of claim or right to charge a tax for this ?
It ’s ridiculous !
Methinks someone ’s forgotten the last time that the Government did something stupid about technology and the e-voting debacle that ensued when the IT community pointed out that the people involved did n’t have a clue what they were talking about .
And this one is aimed at people ’s pockets , and the pockets of businesses .
Hard to see this not causing a problem down the line .

Government spending related to smoking and the abuse of alcohol and illegal drugs reached $ 468 billion in 2005 , accounting for more than one - tenth of combined federal , state and local expenditures for all purposes , according to a new study .
Most abuse - related spending went toward direct health care costs for lung disease , cirrhosis and overdoses , for example , or for law enforcement expenses including incarceration , according to the report released Thursday by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse , a private group at Columbia University .
Just over 2 percent of the total went to prevention , treatment and addiction research .
The study is the first to calculate abuse - related spending by all three levels of government .
“ This is such a stunning misallocation of resources , ” said Joseph A. Califano Jr. , chairman of the center , referring to the lack of preventive measures .
“ It ’s a commentary on the stigma attached to addictions and the failure of governments to make investments in the short run that would pay enormous dividends to taxpayers over time . ”
Beyond resulting in poor health and crime , addictions and substance abuse  especially alcohol  are major underlying factors in other costly social problems like homelessness , domestic violence and child abuse .
Enthusiasts will be upset to learn that both 4 - Day and Saturday One - Day passes for Comic - Con International 2009 ( CCI ) have already sold out .
Pixelated Geek had an opportunity to speak with David Glanzer , Director of Marketing and Public Relations at CCI , for further comments on this matter .
“ People knew it sold out last year and they did n’t want to miss out , ” explains Glanzer .
Online ticket sales for CCI 2009 have been available as early as August 2008 .
Because CCI 2008 experienced an early sold - out show , it seemed that this year , fans wanted to attain tickets as early as possible .
In comparison , tickets for last year ’s convention were not sold out until two weeks prior to the event .
CCI 2009 ’s 4 - Day passes were sold out by mid-March — four months prior to the event .
“ There ’s nothing in terms of key media that we ’ve done or key media that ’s really done anything to promote the July show [ Comic - Con ] .
There ’s just been a lot of word of mouth and people making sure that they ’re not left out . ”
Saturday One - Day passes
While Saturday One - Day passes are obviously sold out , the question remains : is there still any way to get in on that day ?
“ Not really , ” replies Glanzer .
“ However , we will probably be doing ticket giveaways on local radio stations in the LA and San Diego area .
People can win free passes .
Otherwise , there ’s no way to buy a [ Saturday ] pass at this point . ”
Comic - Con Leaving in 2012 ?
Loyal attendees have also acknowledged rumors of Comic - Con leaving the San Diego area .
Glanzer comments on the issue :
“ We have a contract with the Convention Center until 2012 .
One of the things we ’re really trying to do is work with local hotels in the city for additional parking space , so that we can move outside of the building .
We ’ve maximized all of our space within the Convention Center , not only in terms of exhibitors but in terms of attendees . ”
Fortunately , there is talk of the City of San Diego expanding the venue , which will perhaps encourage the Con to stay in the aforementioned city .
Get your tickets now !
“ The river itself is always there , but the water is always changing .
The event is here every year in San Diego , but what happens at the event always changes , ” says Glanzer .
With that , expect some fun listings in the program and hurry !
Purchase tickets while you still can !
For those concerned over a hot , crowded , foul - odor atmosphere , ease up : “ Safety is always a big concern of ours .
Not only a safe environment , but a comfortable one as well . ”
For example , while some conventions have 6 – or 8 - foot aisles , CCI has 10 - or 20 - foot aisles .
Oh , and there ’s lots of air conditioning .
Thank God for air conditioning .

The gunman who killed 13 people at an immigrant services center fired 98 shots in a minute or so , the police chief in Binghamton , New York , said Wednesday .
Police are trying to determine why Jiverly Wong picked the American Civic Association as his target Friday .
Jiverly Wong , a 41 - year - old Vietnamese immigrant from an ethnic Chinese family , fired 87 shots from a 9 mm pistol and 11 shots from a .45 - caliber handgun , Chief Joseph Zikuski told CNN .
Investigators believe the victims died almost instantly , Zikuski said .
Wong was an " accomplished marksman " who frequented a shooting range in Binghamton , the chief said , and he bragged to others that he had fired more than 10,000 rounds .
Wong strode into the American Civic Association on Friday , entered a classroom and started shooting , investigators said .
Wong had been taking English classes at the association , which helps immigrants and refugees from around the world .
He was upset about recently losing a job , but police are still trying to determine why he chose to open fire at the association , Zikuski said .
The police chief said that " it 's not unreasonable to think " that Wong fired his 98 shots " in just over a minute " before he shot and killed himself in the classroom .
Investigators have found that Wong came to the United States in the late 1980s , lived in Binghamton before moving to California in the early 1990s and returned to Binghamton in July 2007 , Zikuski said .
He became a U.S. citizen in 1995 .
He had married and divorced while living in California and had been convicted on a misdemeanor charge of writing bad checks there , the chief said .
At the scene of Friday 's shooting , police found two semiautomatic handguns -- a .45 - caliber and a 9 mm -- that were licensed to Wong .
Wong had attempted to purchase " a number of firearms , " the chief said .
Purchasing a gun in New York takes about two weeks , Zikuski said , and Wong would go back to a store during that period , " cancel that order and purchase another one . "
Wong also was wearing body armor when he went on his spree , and since New York limits body armor purchases to law enforcement , " We 're looking into that , " Zikuski said .
The first funerals for the victims were held Sunday afternoon at a local mosque .
An interfaith memorial service for all the victims was held Sunday evening , and hundreds of people took part in a candlelight vigil afterward .
" In a strange way , " Binghamton Mayor Matthew Ryan said , " this tragedy has brought everyone together . "
CNN 's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report .

Photographs : Jewish Museum Berlin
BERLIN —
His left arm extended , the man in the photograph above holds out a bar of soap .
His right hand is clasped over his heart .
His mouth is opened , as if he were singing an aria about the virtues of Gardenia , the “ real toilet soap ” he is hawking to passers - by .
Both the image and its maker had fallen into obscurity .
Born in what is now Poland in 1899 to a family of German Jews , Ruth Jacobi spent some years in Berlin then permanently immigrated to the United States in 1935 .
She spent decades living quietly as a doctor ’s wife in Astoria , Queens , and abandoned the craft of photography for which her sister , Lotte Jacobi , became famous .
Then , in 2004 , Aubrey Pomerance , the chief archivist at the Jewish Museum Berlin , learned that a trove of photographs by the lesser - known Ms. Jacobi , who died in 1995 and had no children , lay in storage with a relative in Mission Viejo , Calif .
Mr. Pomerance arranged for the museum to acquire much of the collection — some 800 prints and 3,000 negatives — in 2005 .
And after several more years of research and preparation , he mounted an exhibition of around 70 images , “ Ruth Jacobi : Photographs , ” that went on view on Nov. 7 .
The exhibit closed on Sunday — it had already been extended by a month — but Mr. Pomerance hopes to find an American institution to put on the show .
Ms. Jacobi ’s family had been in the photography business for three generations ; her great - grandfather , family lore has it , studied with Louis Daguerre , the photographic pioneer who invented the Daguerreotype process .
Ruth was trained at the Lette - Verein photographic school for women , and after five years working in her family ’s Berlin studio , she traveled to the United States in 1928 , joining a husband , Hans Richter , whom she had married two years earlier .
“ It was a very unhappy marriage , probably on the brink of separation , but he talked her into a new beginning , ” Mr. Pomerance said .
“ They went to New York together , where she tried to find a job as a photographer and did a lot of menial jobs . ”
At various points she worked as a cook and at a photo agency .
She met with Alfred Stieglitz , who was instrumental in securing photography ’s acceptance as an art form and who gave Ms. Jacobi encouragement .
I was struck by Ruth Jacobi ’s images on a recent vacation in Berlin during a visit to the museum , which was designed by Daniel Libeskind and opened in September 2001 ( two days before the 9/11 attacks ) .
The works evoked other famous images of early 20th - century life on the Lower East Side — like those made by Helen Levitt and Rebecca Lepkoff — but with a different sensibility and mood .
The Lower East Side photographs documented street life among the Eastern European Jewish immigrants who had made the neighborhood one of the most densely populated urban quarters anywhere in the world .
Several of the images are of vendors , selling pretzels , herring , cloth , shoes , fruit and other goods .
Other images show Union Square , the docks and a window - washer .
One of the most enigmatic — and humorous — images shows a well - dressed woman walking down a sidewalk , holding a goose by a leash .
The woman and the goose are in the same position — striding forward , right foot forward .
Ms. Jacobi returned to Berlin in 1930 , and from 1931 ran her family ’s photography studio with her sister , Lotte , who was three years older and would eventually became famous as a portraitist of cultural , literary and artistic figures like Berenice Abbott , Marc Chagall , Robert Frost , Paul Robeson , J. D. Salinger , Edward Steichen and Stieglitz .
The sisters opened a photography studio together in New York in September 1935 .
But they parted ways in 1936 .
Ruth Jacobi abandoned photography a few years later , and instead devoted her time to her second husband , Morris Roth , a Hungarian - born physician she met in 1935 .
They lived in Astoria until his death in 1972 , then she lived on West 66th Street until moving to southern California around 1987 .
Interestingly , the image by Ruth Jacobi that has probably been the most widely published and seen is a portrait of her sister , who died in 1990 .
“ Ruth published hardly any pictures of her own , under her own name , ” Mr. Pomerance said .
One notable exception was the use of Ruth ’s images for the dust jacket of Michael Gold ’s best - selling novel “ Jews Without Money , ” published in 1930 in the United States and in Germany in 1931 .
The jacket was designed by John Heartfield , a pioneer of photomontage who was known for his criticisms of both the Weimar Republic and the Nazi regime that replaced it .
Mr. Pomerance said the first reaction of many of the visitors to the exhibition was surprise that Lotte Jacobi had a sister .
More than that , he said he hoped the exhibition would revive interest in an accomplished photographer whose career , though relatively brief , provided an important glimpse at life in Europe and New York in the fateful years before the Second World War .
“ I think what we ’ve done is put Ruth Jacobi on the map , ” he said .
“ You ca n’t think of the Atelier Jacobi anymore without Ruth . ”

Guatemalan president Alvaro Colom has been hit with allegations that he ordered and then covered up the murder of Rodrigo Rosenberg , 47 , a Guatemalan lawyer who has shocked the country with a posthumous video implicating the president in his assassination .
Rosenberg was a Harvard - and Oxford - educated lawyer and father of four who , by all accounts , was an upstanding citizen .
He maintained a private practice and taught at the Rafael Landivar Law School in Guatemala City .
Things started getting sticky for him when he began looking into the murder of Khalil Musa , one of his clients who was killed last April .
Musa was a businessman who had been recruited by the Colom administration to join the board of a local bank , partially owned by the Guatemalan government .
Rosenberg claimed that Musa uncovered a web of corruption and greed while on the board and offered his resignation to Colom immediately .
But the president and his associates grew paranoid that Musa would rat them out and decided to have him silenced permanently .
At Rosenberg 's funeral , his family released a video that began with the lawyer defiantly declaring , " If you are listening to this message , it ’s because I was murdered by President Alvaro Colom , with the help of [ the
president ’s private secretary ]
Gustavo Alejos and [ alleged drug dealer ] Gregorio Valdez . "
Rosenberg then labels the president “ a thief , a murderer and a coward ” and goes on to explain how he was threatened directly by Alejos , who warned him that he , too , would be killed if he did n't stop looking into Musa 's death .
Since the video surfaced , Guatemala has been rocked by protests calling for Colom 's resignation .
The web of corruption in which President Colom has been implicated can be traced back to Mexico and the growing power of organized crime and the drug cartels .
Colom has been accused of having connections to the drug cartels since 2003 .

Most languages were caught unaware by the multicore revolution .
C++ , predictably , developed a portable assembly language for multiprocessors ( C++0 x atomics ) .
Out of sheer desperation some programmers turned to Erlang .
Many still try to ignore the elephant in the room , while others try to shoot it with BB guns provided by their favorite languages .
I ’ve looked at many languages and decided that none provided the right combination of performance and safety .
We are still waiting for the next big one to break into the multicore territory .
Towards this goal , I ’ll present a series of posts in which I ’m going to develop a
threading model for that hypothetical language .
The model is based on several papers that I reviewed in my previous blogs posts .
My own contribution is putting the best of those ideas together into one package .
I will use syntax similar to that of the D programming language , but C++ and Java programmers should n’t have problems following it .
Teaser # 1
In one of my previous posts I described a concurrent data structure based on Haskell ’s MVar .
It ’s essentially a one - element message queue .
Let ’s have a peek at the implementation that uses my proposed multithreaded scheme .
Notice the total absence of special annotations–even the synchronized keyword is missing .
The only unusual thing is the move operator , := , introduced in my previous blog .
It is needed in case we want to pass unique objects through MVar .
You are probably asking yourself , How the heck is this supposed to work in a multithreaded environment ?
Read on !
class MVar<T> { private : T _msg ; bool _full ; public : // put : asynchronous ( non-blocking ) // Precondition : MVar must be empty void put ( T msg ) { assert ( ! _full ) ; _msg := msg ; // move _full = true ; notify ( ) ; } // take :
If empty , blocks until full .
// Removes the message and switches state to empty T take ( ) { while ( ! _full ) wait ( ) ; _full = false ; return := _msg ; } }
Let ’s instantiate this template as a monitor –that is an object accessible from multiple threads .
We do it by specifying the owner as “ self ” ( the this owner is not explicitly listed as a template parameter , but it can be passed to the template during instantiation ) .
auto mVar = new MVar < owner :: self , int > ;
In a self - owned object all methods are automatically synchronized .
The move operator acting on an int simply copies it .
That was easy !
How about instantiating a self - owned MVar for passing unique objects ?
Piece of cake !
auto q = new MVar < owner : : self , unique Foo > ; auto foo = new unique Foo ; q.put ( := foo ) ; // move foo assert ( foo is null ) ; // another thread unique Foo f2 = q.get ( ) ; // implicit move of rvalue
So far data races have been avoided by implicit synchronization in self - owned objects and by the use of move semantics for unique objects .
Of course you know how to break the MVar , right ?
Instantiate it with a regular , non-unique class objects and watch aliases spread through threads .
Let ’s try it :
auto mVar = new MVar < owner : : self , Foo > ; auto my Foo = new Foo ; m Var.put( myFoo ) ; // now let me race through my local alias ! myFoo.method ( ) ;
Surprise !
This code will not compile because a self - owned object cannot have a thread - local member .
Because of a richer type system , the compiler can easily detect such violations .
I ’ll explain the details of the ownership scheme in my future posts –for now let me assure you that , no matter how hard you try , you ca n’t create a data race in this system ( unless you bypass it with explicit casts ) .
How to making concurrent programming safer ?
I propose to do this by extending the type system .
( You ’ve already seen some examples above . )
I realize that there is strong resistance to extending a language ’s type system .
The main problem is increased complexity .
The programmers are reluctant to study and use complex annotation schemes .
I will argue that , in the case of multithreading , the complexity argument is reversed .
Shared - memory multithreading is hard !
Figuring out how to avoid all the pitfalls of sharing is harder than learning a type system that prevents them .
If a programmer is not willing to learn or cannot understand the race - free type system , he or she should not be writing multithreaded programs .
How to limit complexity ?
To limit the complexity of the type system , I came up with several simple principles .
The most important one is that multithreaded extensions should not require modifications to single - threaded programs .
That means coming up with reasonable defaults for all new annotations .
If necessary , the compiler should be able to derive some of the defaults from program analysis .
Because modularity is very important , such analysis should not creep across compilation unit boundaries .
Whole - program analysis is out of the question .
How to keep goals reasonable ?
There are two major challenges in multithreaded programming :
Avoiding races Preventing deadlocks
The first problem is approachable , whereas the second seems to be a pie in the sky .
I will therefore concentrate on designing a race - free system that is based on existing academic research .
Such system would be incomplete without some support for lock - free programming .
There are very good reasons for the language to enforce sequential consistency .
For comparison , C++ committee , after a long struggle , decided to allow non-SC primitives ( weak atomics ) .
Java only enforces SC for volatile variables .
Teaser # 2
Speaking of lock - free programming , here ’s the implementation of the infamous Double - Checked Locking Pattern :
class Singleton < T> { private : lockfree T _value ; public : T get ( ) lockfree { if ( _value is null ) { synchronized ( this ) { if ( _value is null ) _value = new T ; } return _value ; } } }
A lockfree variable is guaranteed to be always atomically accessed in a sequentially consistent way .
A lockfree method is not synchronized , but it can only operate on lockfree variables ( or use a synchronized section ) .
Even though the use of lockfree does n’t introduce low - level races , it may create high - level races when accessing more that one lockfree variable at a time .
But we all know that lock free programming is only for desperadoes .
Lessons learned from previous work
There are many commonalities in various approaches to race freedom .
Ownership should be built into the type system .
In OO languages each object must have an owner .
In C - like languages each piece of data must have an associated lock .
There should be efficient mechanisms for passing data between threads
By value By reference .
( The object being passed must be a monitor . )
As immutable data , by const reference
By unique reference using move semantics
Most of those ideas are expressible through type qualifiers .
Higher - level models
Explicit synchronization is hard , no doubt about it .
In my proposal , the type system makes it safe .
There are however other models of concurrency that , although more restrictive , are often easier to use .
One such model is based on message passing .
In my opinion , support for message passing should be library - based .
The race - free type system will make it safe and flexible .
It will , for instance , support passing messages not only by value but also by reference –without sacrificing safety .
In traditional type systems there is no way to express the requirement that a message passed by reference must either be a monitor itself ( have it ’s own lock ) or behave like a C++ unique_ptr ( an object that leaves no aliases behind ) .
This requirement should be expressible through the type system , allowing the compiler to check for its violations .
I ’ve been paying a lot of attention to software transactional memory ( STM ) .
I believe that STM could be built into the language–again , with the support of the type system .
It looks like the hardest problem with STM is how it should inter-operate with other types of multithreaded access ( both locked and lock - free ) .
The simplest solution is to enforce full isolation –no STM object can ever be accessed outside of a transaction .
It ’s not clear how practical such approach is , but it definitely simplifies things to the point that STM becomes orthogonal to other types of synchronization .
And that means it will be possible to tackle it at a later time , after the race - free multithreading model is firmly established .
In the next installment , I will describe the ownership scheme that is the foundation of the race - free type system .

NEW YORK —
Why is a pair of American warships shadowing a North Korean rust - bucket called the Kang Nam I as it makes its way from the Sea of Japan toward Southeast Asia ?
American intelligence officials believe the ship carries illicit arms meant for the military dictatorship in Myanmar .
Or , hint anonymous “ intelligence sources , ” perhaps impoverished , pariah state Myanmar is just a way station for a more nefarious technology transfer .
Sadly , the world probably will never know which is the case .
New United Nations Security Council sanctions passed after North Korea tested its latest nuclear warhead authorized the world ’s navies to monitor such traffic .
China , which has traditionally protected Pyongyang from the harshest Security Council rebukes , even voted for the sanctions this time , a significant symbolic shift and a victory for U.S. diplomacy .
But Beijing still blocked efforts to authorize boarding parties to inspect suspect North Korean vessels .
For that to happen , North Korea would have to give its permission , which is about as likely as Kim Jong Il turning up at the next board meeting of Human Rights Watch .
Such is the infuriating status quo at the U.N.
Even a nuclear explosion by a nation that sells its nuclear knowledge to the highest bidder , shoots poorly engineered missiles over their neighbors ’ heads and treats its own population like prison inmates could not bring coherent action from the Security Council .
And so Barack Obama finds himself in a familiar position for an American president .
Having seen a diplomatic initiative spurned with a nuclear test , he talked tough and did due diligence by working through the existing U.N. channels .
And for his pains , he finds himself with less leeway to deal with a ship that might ( though it is unlikely ) be carrying a nuclear weapon than he had with a bunch of teenaged Somali pirates .
It did not take long for Obama ’s domestic enemies to gloat .
Smarting from the years in which their own approaches ( including diplomatic quarantine , covert action , and preemptive warfare ) failed , they were loath to see Obama ’s squishy diplomatic initiatives bear fruit .
How happy they must now be .
Still , with the exception of the one - third of Americans who constitute the permanently embittered minority , reasonable people should have some pity for Obama at this stage .
Inheritor of a zombie banking sector , a seized - up auto industry , two raging wars , and poisonous hands in Iran and North Korea , he ’s had little time to put a stamp of his own on world events .
And the best case scenario for many of these problems is slow , gradual improvement .
For some , including Iran , North Korea , and aspects of the global economy , improvement depends less than ever on America ’s actions .
George H.W. Bush could shoot for a “ new world order . ”
Bill Clinton ’s secretary of state , Madeleine Albright , called America “ the indispensible nation . ”
George W. Bush created the “ indefensible nation . ”
Now Obama must salvage what he can of the goodwill the U.S. took with it out of the 20th century .
Obama 's speech in Cairo invited the Muslim world to end the “ cycle of suspicion and discord ” that has characterized relations with America since the end of World War II .
He recorded a video message for Iran promising a “ new beginning ” and sent feelers to Russia .
Both were spurned .
Truman - like , he sacked a highly decorated commander of the Afghan war and replaced him with Gen.
Stanley McChrystal , a counterinsurgency specialist whose own writings on the topic echo the “ smart power ” approach espoused by the new White House .
Obama promised to keep his promise to get U.S. forces out of Iraq — well , all but 50,000 of them — and he shows signs of reversing America ’s disgraceful reputation as a leading global polluter .
All of these made good sense as first steps .
Now , each demands a second step which is far , far more difficult to achieve .
With regard to North Korea , that decision may be only hours away .
As the Kang Nam chugs toward its destination — probably the Myanmar port city of Thilawa — Obama faces a delicate decision .
Should he order the Seventh Fleet to go beyond the U.N. Security Council ’s writ and board the Kang Nam ?
Facing a much more serious ( and well - documented ) risk , John F. Kennedy did precisely that during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1961 .
Yet to follow that course today runs the risk that the increasingly irrational North will respond with a wild retribution of some kind against South Korea and the American troops based there .
The North need not go nuclear to cause thousands of deaths .
Within the range of its tens of thousands of artillery tubes on the 37th parallel is the entire city of Seoul and some of the U.S. garrison , too .
“ What we 're not going to do is to reward belligerence and provocation in the way that 's been done in the past , ” Obama said , a reference to the sand Kim Jong
Il kicked in the eyes of both Clinton and Bush after previous American initiatives were spurned .
What then , Mr. President , will North Korea ’s reward be this time ?
It ’s a very dangerous moment , indeed .

Decoding North Korea
I do n’t think we are .
Yes , we talk about using it a lot , discovering new technologies , and making existing ones more efficient .
But we are n’t deploying all the technologies we have .
Case in point : solar panels .
We have the technology to drastically cut our reliance on traditional electricity production .
In sunny parts of the U.S. , homes can be powered entirely by solar panels that can fit directly on their roof .
In less sunny parts of the U.S. , such as my home state of Maine , they might still fully power a very energy efficient home , and even if not , they could provide a substantial portion of the energy said home would use , cutting down the need for a lot of the fossil fuel electricity we use .
So why are n’t we using more of these ?
Well , I have some ideas on this .
One is cost .
It ’s a big investment to make , around $ 20,000 .
This is a big investment for a homeowner to make , and a big one for the government to make if it ’s subsidizing all the homes in the country , or even those below a certain level of wealth .
Assuming about 160 million homes in the U.S. ( from the last Census count ) , that would cost the government 3 trillion dollars to pay for everyone to get solar panels installed .
A good middle ground right now is that some state governments , and I believe the federal government , do provide rebates and tax cuts to those willing to invest in solar power for their homes .
Still , the cost is high , and these programs are n’t really advertised and pushed .
Of course , in the long term , they usually do pay for themselves in savings , but realistically , not everyone can make the up front investment .
Another issue , that I think plays a bigger role than cost , is that they do n’t look nice .
We make such a big deal about appearances in our culture that I think even if they were more cost efficient , many people would n’t adopt them even then .
I ’ve told friends that when I have my own place and the money to invest , I ’m getting solar panels for my home .
I ’ve suggested others do the same for the long term savings .
None of them cited cost as a reason not to do so .
They all claimed that solar cells make a house look ugly .
Honestly , this does n’t sit very well with me .
I ’d say energy efficiency and renewable energy are a lot more important than how pretty the outside of the house is .
Perhaps I ’m just weird , but it seems like the substantial things are more important than aesthetics .
I think we ought to try another method of selling solar panels .
Since they ’re such a large and important investment , let ’s see a monthly payment plan… perhaps companies could charge the savings in utility bills each month , so the person investing pays the same amount monthly for electricity , but is also paying to own the solar panels eventually as well .
When the solar panels are paid off , the person who had them installed owns them in full .
This would make investing in solar panels much more reasonable cost wise .
Perhaps the government could provide some kind of subsidy to companies willing to work with this arrangement , in addition to the people investing in solar .
Seems like it could help promote solar a lot in this way .
We ’d still have to deal with getting people to accept the aesthetic issues , but I think this plan could help deal with cost very well .
Of course , there ’s also wind , water , and geothermal , and these seem to be gaining more traction , though there ’s a lot more work to do .
Some places do power themselves mostly on these forms of energy , since they happen to have the naturally occurring resources to make use of these kinds of energy .
These forms of energy do n’t require people to sacrifice appearances though , which is why I think they ’re more popular .
They ’re certainly very useful , and we should promote these and other renewable energies as well .
I do think solar has the greatest potential , since the sun shines just about everywhere , though obviously more in some places than in others .
The arctic circle would have some special challenges , in that they would need a way to store large amounts of solar energy for a long period of time for it to be practical .
Perhaps another form of energy would be more practical after hitting a certain northerly point .
In the end , solar may or may not be our best solution .
I do n’t really know .
But right now , it seems like a very a good one that is talked about a lot , but implemented far less often .
We have the technology now .
We just do n’t have the investment in it , or the drive to make it happen .
This is what needs to change to make it feasible .
Edit : Someone on Reddit pointed out that I failed to consider corporate use of power , as well as the fleets of automobiles we have throughout the country .
To be clear , this piece is only about cutting our consumption of fossil fuels in regards to producing electricity .
As such , dealing with the auto issues is beyond the scope of this piece .
Though it is true if we switch to electric powered cars , this is also an issue we ’d have to deal with .
However , the point about corporate use of electricity is very true , and it very much slipped my mind .
Taking automobiles out of the picture , $ 67 trillion would be very high , but the figure of $ 3 trillion I proposed would be too low .
Also , bear in mind I was n’t talking about completely replacing other forms of energy , but cutting down on the necessity of using them to maintain our standard of living .
Basically , using none would be awesome , but using less is still very good .
My revised idea for dealing with that is this : let corporations make the first big investment in solar energy .
Perhaps provide incentives to them for doing so , though honestly , I think it would be in the best interests of a corporation to make this investment without incentives .
Obviously , it would cost more for a corporation to make the switch than a homeowner , as they have a lot more energy they need to produce .
However , they would also see a faster return on their investment since they use so much more energy .
Still , many corporations have the money to spend up front , though it would certainly effect the bottom line .
Perhaps showing them the way it could benefit the company long term would be enough to get them to begin investing .
This initial investment would let corporations produce cleaner energy , and it would provide funds for research into more efficient solar power at the same time .
More efficient solar power would mean reduced costs for those in the residential sector , as well as for any upgrades in the corporate sector .
As the price comes down , more people could afford to invest in it , and it could spread more easily .
Edit 6/8/2010 : Also , here ’s an image about how much solar panel coverage we would need to power the entire world using just solar panels .
Yes , it ’s a lot , but it ’s probably not as much as you expect .
