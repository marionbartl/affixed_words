If Peter Moberg were to give a single criticism of his colleague 's work , it would be that it represents a complete and total misunderstanding of the principles of software development .
Criticisms # 2 and # 3 would probably center around typos / misspellings and completely superfluous code .

Merle Savage was an " outdoors person " who found joy in the big things Mother Nature had to offer .
She climbed Alaska 's mountains and hiked the Grand Canyon .
But then the big spill hit , and there would be no more climbing , no more hiking , and very little joy .
As a cleanup worker in the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez disaster , Savage says she breathed crude - and dispersant - laced mist for weeks .
(< target = " _blank " > This photograph speaks for itself . )
She was healthy for age fifty — she < target = " _blank " > looked healthy — but soon experienced crippling health problems that have lasted for two decades : coughing spells , violent diarrhea , pneumonia , obstructed blood vessels .
Her liver cirrhosis onset baffled doctors .
" We were all coughing and vomiting for months , " says Savage , who had no prior history of drinking or smoking and did not wear a respirator during the cleanup .
" We thought it was the flu .
Exxon told us crude oil was non -toxic and we believed them . "
She has limited legal recourse — a court sealed Exxon 's medical records until 2023 , she says — but now , twenty - one years later , her primary concern is not herself .
Savage 's " quest , " and that of several environmental activists and locals taking a hard look at the aftershocks of the 2010 disaster , has become protecting the health of her modern counterparts in the Gulf of Mexico , who have been exposed to a variation of the same dispersant — and even more toxic oil .
Because she does n't want any of them to live her waking nightmare , and no one wants the BP spill to become for local volunteers and fisherman what 9/11 became for workers at the World Trade Center .
The Trouble with Suing BP
A hundred cleanup workers in Louisiana and Alabama have reported chest pains , skin - and - eye irritation , nose bleeds , stomach problems , nausea , and cognitive disruption , which medical experts believe is just the beginning .
Last week a group of Louisiana fishermen sued BP and dispersant manufacturer Nalco over toxicity concerns .
For the thousands who have already been exposed , it could already be too late .
" The average age of a person working in Valdez was fifty - one and they 're mostly dead now , " says Arlen Braud , the attorney representing the Louisiana plaintiffs .
" One of my clients had severe migraines and respiratory problems after traveling near the dispersants .
It 's so arrogant : a UK company using a chemical banned in the UK for endangering the food chain . "
According to Braud , BP is " telling workers ' you can't have lawyers and talk to us , ' " possibly because " lawyers might warn people about the health effects ten years down the road . "
BP claims that air quality is acceptable and respirators are unnecessary ( based on decades - old OSHA standards that its director decries as " outrageously out of date " ) , and Nalco defends its product as " a safe , effective , and critical tool in mitigating additional damage in the Gulf , " despite conflicting messages from the EPA .
But Louisiana residents with their hands both literally and figuratively in the oil remain deeply skeptical of BP 's response .
" The only people getting sick are the ones cleaning up the spill , " says Jim Gossen , CEO of Louisiana Foods - Global Seafood Source , who owns a beach house in Grand Isle .
" My friend 's brother - in - law was sick for days ; he said dispersants were sprayed ten miles from their shrimp boat .
The deckhand threw up blood in the hospital — they must have had dispersants in their blood — but I can't imagine BP would admit it . "
Wilma Subra , a Louisiana chemist who regularly meets with federal officials about the spill , testified before a congressional committee that workers have been forced to handle crude oil with their bare hands , and " [t ] hose fishermen who attempted to wear respirators while working were threatened to be fired by BP due to the workers using respirators . "
( BP insists that it provides respirators and hazmat gear upon request . )
Was BP's Safety Training a Joke ?
What 's more , BP - associated companies offer workers a four - hour safety course — as opposed to the typical forty - hour course — that reportedly fails to address " chemical inhalation , the health effects of dispersants , and the risks of direct contact with weathered crude oil , " according to ProPublica.org , paraphrasing an official at HHS .
A Florida construction worker , who requested anonymity because he fears retribution from BP , confirmed the lack of safety training .
" The class was about how to put your hardhat , boots , and glasses on , " he says .
" The trainer was essentially a motivational speaker trying to get us excited about the money and the free lunch .
It was a joke .
There was not one word about inhalation or absorption ; it was skipped over completely .
They said we do n't want a respirator because we are n't trained to use it , and the permit card had a disclaimer about how the training is in no way comprehensive .
I thought ' Holy shit , this just ai n't right . ' "
Last Friday the Coast Guard cracked down on a four - hour training program offered in Jean Lafitte , Louisiana , according to marine toxicologist Dr. Riki Ott .
" It only took them two months , " Ott scoffs .
" That 's a tiny step in the right direction . "
' Decades of Misery '
After studying cleanup workers from the Exxon Valdez spill , Ott is convinced that today 's Gulf fishermen are not merely risking their short - range health .
" The Exxon Valdez oil was considerably less toxic than Louisiana sweet crude , and it wreaked havoc on any life forms that encountered it , " she says , including brain lesions , coma , and death .
" We are setting up here for a giant human tragedy — decades of misery — especially if a storm or hurricane spreads it to normal everyday people onshore . "
Ott claims that Exxon exploited OSHA loopholes , such as a two - year filing limit even though overexposure symptoms can take decades to appear ( another loophole : rejecting early claims as negligible cold and flu symptoms ) , to deny medical coverage to cleanup workers .
" Now BP is using the loopholes .
People are not supposed to be getting sick , but it 's happening . "
Savage , the Exxon Valdez worker who has been sick for decades , will continue to share her story , even if only a fraction of Gulf fishermen will hear it .
" These 18 - year - old kids are throwing away their lives for fifteen dollars per hour to clean up the oil , " she says .
" That 's the price on their lives , and there should n't be a price . "

Two sources have told us that director Adam McKay ( Anchorman , the upcoming action - comedy The Other Guys ) is in serious talks with Sony Pictures to helm an adaptation of the comic book series The Boys .
Near the end of April , we reported that director Samuel Bayer ( the remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street ) said he wanted to adapt the comic , but that “ The studio is really hot on [ McKay ] ” .
We ’ve been told that McKay is a die - hard comic book fan and that he ’s been looking to tackle a movie in the comic book genre .
I always support directors taking risks and heading out into uncharted waters in their career .
Due to the extreme violence and language in the comics , I doubt we ’re looking at his fifth feature film with Will Ferrell .
However , just to be clear : no contracts have been signed and in Hollywood everything can change in a heartbeat .
But right now , it looks likely that we ’ll be hearing official word soon .
Hit the jump to learn more about the comic .
The Boys was created by writer Garth Ennis ( Preacher ) and illustrator Darick Robertson ( Transmetropolitan ) .
According to Wikipedia ,
“ The series is set in a contemporary world very much similar to the real one , with one notable exception : a number of people have some form of superpower .
The series follows a superpowered CIA squad , known informally as ‘ The Boys ’ , whose job it is to keep watch on superheroes and , if necessary , intimidate or kill them . ”
The Boys are comprised of the characters , “ Billy Butcher ” , “ Hughie Campbell ” , “ Mother ’s Milk ” , “ The Frenchman ” , “ The Female ( of the Species ) ” , “ Lieutenant Colonel Greg D. Mallory ” , and “ The Legend ” .
While Ennis ’ work has come to rub me the wrong way ( it seems like he engages in vulgarity for vulgarity ’s sake ) , I ’m excited to see what McKay would do with a project that ’s so different that anything he ’s done previously .

Scare tactics on biomass
Posted Tuesday , June 8 , 2010 7:44 am
Like too many ballot initiatives in Massachusetts over the years , the proposed November referendum targeting biomass plants is a narrow special interest effort that could have statewide repercussions , including in Berkshire County .
Also too typical of today 's political climate , the effort resorts to scare tactics rather than facts in making its case to the public .
Opposition to a proposed wood - burning biomass plant in Russell is the genesis for the referendum campaign orchestrated by a group based in Cambridge .
Having failed to persuade the Legislature to ban the plants , the group wants to establish emission restrictions so unrealistic that no biomass plant could reach them , choking off the state subsidies crucial to the financing of their construction .
In opposing the ballot initiative , the Legislature 's Joint Committee on Telecommunications , Utilities and Energy observed that if approved " this overly broad initiative petition would prevent the development of many forms of renewable energy by cutting off their access to essential incentives . "
Overwrought opponents conjure nightmare images of state forests clear - cut into oblivion to feed biomass plants even though such behavior would result in the plants putting themselves out of business .
This also fails to take into consideration the strict regulations already in place to protect forests and regulate biomass plants .
These plants would also play a role in reducing our dependence on truly dangerous energy sources like coal and oil , which cause destruction in their extraction and pollution in their burning .
If approved , and signatures are still being collected to put the referendum question on the ballot , two local projects , one a biofuel plant planned to provide energy for Crane & Company , the other an effort to grow algae rich in oil to fuel all the power needs of a local farm , could be hamstrung .
These are exactly the kind of responsible environmental projects that should be encouraged , not discouraged .
They reduce dependence on fuel sources from outside the region , provide local jobs and ideally could put the Berkshires on the cutting edge of development of new sources of renewable energy .
Groups that oppose alternative energy sources like wind and biomass are doing the work of the coal companies and oil giants so much in the news lately for all the wrong reasons .
NIMBY - motivated special interest ballot initiatives like this one threaten to hinder the pursuit of alternative energy sources and crimp Berkshire efforts to take a leading role in the pursuit of those sources .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Scientists have found three genetic differences that affect a person ’s risk of being deficient in the “ sunshine ” vitamin D and say their work helps explain why sunlight and a good diet are n’t always enough .

British and American researchers studied the genes of almost 34,000 white Europeans and found that variants of three genes involved in cholesterol synthesis , vitamin D metabolism and vitamin D transport may increase the risk of deficiency .
“ Our findings establish a role for common genetic variants in regulation of circulating vitamin D concentrations , ” said Elina Hypponen of the University College London Institute of Child Health , who worked on the study .
She said the presence of the variants at the three specific genes more than doubled the risk of vitamin D insufficiency .
Most vitamin D is made by the body as a natural by - product of the skin ’s exposure to sunlight .
It is vital for health , as it helps cells absorb calcium and is key for bone strength .
Some recent studies have also suggested vitamin D may protect against cancer , artery disease and tuberculosis .
A normal level of vitamin D is defined as a concentration greater than 30 nanograms per millilitre ( ng/ ml ) , while vitamin D insufficiency is 20 to 30 ng / ml and vitamin D deficiency is less than 20 ng / ml .
Almost half of the world ’s population has lower than optimal levels of vitamin D and scientists say the problem is getting worse as people spend more time indoors or cover up too quickly and completely when they are exposed to sunshine .
Non -white populations in less sunny climates are at higher risk since dark skin can make it harder for the body to absorb ultraviolet light .
Hypponen said there was no doubt that sunshine and a good diet were still the most important factors for vitamin D levels , but the study helped explain why some people who should get enough from these sources still appear to be deficient .
“ Sometimes when we look at geographical variations in vitamin D deficiency , they do not always go logically in the way we would expect , for example , on the basis of sunlight , ” she said in a telephone interview .
“ So this study raises the possibility that that is down to genetic influences . ”
Besides the sunlight source , vitamin D can also be found in fish liver oil , eggs and fatty fish such as salmon , herring and mackerel , or taken as a supplement .
There are no definitive studies on the optimal daily vitamin D dose but some experts recommend 25 to 50 micrograms .
A study published in March found that vitamin D is important in activating the immune system ’s killer cells , known as T cells , which remain dormant and unaware of threats from infections if vitamin D is lacking in the blood .

BP 's chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg has been taken to task for a statement he made to reporters after a meeting with President Obama and other White House officials : " I hear comments sometimes that large oil companies are really companies that do n’t care , but that is not the case in BP , we care about the small people . "
The Economist 's new language blog Johnson chalks up Svanberg 's unfortunate wording to his lack of fluency in English , suggesting that he " may have heard a venerable American phrase , ' the little guy , ' and tried to use it , simply misremembering slightly . "
On Talking Points Memo , Josh Marshall speculates that " the small people " was the result of a " phrase in Swedish he might have been carrying over into English . "
And indeed , BP spokesman Toby Odone told the Associated Press that " it is clear that what he means is that he cares about local businesses and local people .
This was a slip in translation . "
Around the blogosphere , Swedish speakers have further explained " the small people " as a translation of the phrase " den lilla människan . "
There 's a bit of disagreement , however , about how condescending that phrase might be in Swedish .
In the comments on the Washington Post 's 44 blog , " kentnilsson8 " writes :
I am Swedish and would easily make same mistake as Svanberg did .
In Sweden we often talk about " den lilla människan " this translates to " the small human " in direct translation .
However this is not insulting at all but is used as a tender name that express a humans vulerability to circumstances and events beyond their control .
So , in this case it means the individual is small in the sense that when an ocean is suddenly filled with oil , one person can not do much by him or herself .
On Balloon Juice , we hear from " Thaswede " :
It was just an error in translation from his part .
He tried to translate a Swedish saying into English and it went wrong .
In Sweden we often say “ den lilla människan ” ( lit : “ the little human ” ) when we talk about someone or a group of people who either is up against larger forces or odds , or simply have been unfortunate enough to be caught in the middle between ( much ) bigger and more powerful players / forces / events .
On the ABC News blog Political Punch , Martin Olsson pitches in :
I am a native speaking swede and in this context we would say " Den lilla människan " .
That translates directly into " small people " .
For us swedes , " den lilla människan " would refer to a person or group of people who are not in control of their own destiny and in need of help .
But on the same blog , Fredrik Andersson disagrees with Olsson 's interpretation :
What are you talking about ?
The Swedish phrase " den lilla människan " is just as demeaning in swedish as it is in english , " small people " .
Stop representing us Swedes Martin !
That is clearly a degrading comment in either language .
Josh Marshall sums up the moral of the story : " Given how bad a situation BP is in right now , I 'm not sure it was a hot idea to have their non-native English speaking Chairman speak off the cuff in front of the TV cameras . "

You ’ve admitted to sucking at video games , but you co-host a video game show .
How did you make it through the rigorous video game host screening process ?
Performance enhancing drugs ?
Cybernetics ?
Well , I do n’t know if I ’ve ever used the term “ sucking ” , but I ’m far less sophisticated at video games than all of my viewers .
Does that sound better than “ sucking ” ?
No ?
Okay , I might suck .
But , to answer your question of how I made it through the censors to become the new host of “ Attack of the Show ” … well , to tell you the truth , I do n’t know .
Maybe the best way to describe how I got the job is to tell you about my audition .
My agent called me and gave me an appointment to audition for G4 .
I went in and did my thing .
I remember very clearly that I walked into the audition promising to just “ be myself ” .
See , as an actress / host in LA you ’re always running around trying to get work and you just want everyone to like you and in that process , I think it ’s easy to lose sight of who you are and you just try to be “ perfect ” .
And what you have to realize , and what I realized right before my G4 audition , is that trying to be perfect is annoying and no one likes that .
And the only thing I can bring to the table that no one else can , is me .
If I was myself , they ’ll either love it or hate it .
But at least I was being true to myself , and that , I could live with .
Thankfully , the executives really liked me and offered me the job .
The fact of the matter is that Kevin , my co-host , is tech - savvy and amazing at video games .
I did n’t need to be .
I came in to be myself and I ’ve found out more about myself on air than I did off - air .
For example : I ’ll slip around in baby oil and dislocate my shoulder on live TV and not cry .
I ’m stronger than I thought .

You have a pretty quick - witted , well - developed sense of low - brow humor .
With women , I ’ve noticed that this is usually a direct result of being raised in a household filled with men or filled with tragedy .
Where do you think your humor comes from ?
It ’s both .
From the outside , my family seemed perfect .
Like “ The Brady Bunch . ”
My mother remarried when I was two years old to a man who already had two children .
With my sister , that made four children and then my mother had my little brother - there were five of us in this traditional mixed family .
I knew early on to make people think everything was amazing ..
In reality , my stepfather ( who my mother later divorced ) was a horrible person , father , husband and man .
To escape the yelling and hitting , I became the clown of the family .
I wanted to do anything to make my brothers and sisters laugh .
After almost every movie we watched , I would act out all the parts … but in a completely satirical , not - quite - perfect way .
I soon moved on to teachers .
If you ever see me , ask me to do “ Miss Phillips ” … it was my trademark back in the day .
It was my impersonations that got my first laughs .
And when my big brother , Jimmy , would laugh , I felt like the coolest kid in the world .
I always admired him and wanted him to think I was funny .
So , I was always taking cues from him and trying to learn to keep up with his quick - wit .
My older sister has a very dry sense of humor , so I got a lot of that from her .
When are you gonna pull a “ Greg Kinnear ” and make the jump to indie movie super stardom ?
When I first started at G4 I had to turn down a lot of theatrical work .
It sucked .
I only came onto the network if I could continue to act .
By the time I came onto the network , I had only been in LA for a year before I got my first movie and TV series .
I really wanted to keep up both ..
But , some “ stuff ” had to be figured out and now G4 works with me on letting me take on other work .
I just finished a movie with the Broken Lizard comedy troupe called “ The Slammin ’ Salmon ” and we actually created a TV series together that we ’re pitching .
But , indie movie stardom ?
I would be so thankful to keep working and making movies .
I ’m always reading scripts and ready to work .
I love working .
And I love being creative .
But , I do mean it when I say I do n’t want to leave G4 .
I love my coworkers , fans , and Kevin .
As long as I can keep acting , I will stay at G4 as long as they ’ll have me .
You vs. the boys at Penny Arcade : who would win in a fight ?
Now are we talking virtual fighting on an arcade game or like anything goes - scratch your eyes - kick you in the crotch - fighting ?
If it ’s the latter , I ’m totally dominating .
My mom put me in years of karate , so I ’m pretty good at taking care of myself … .
That combined with the fact that I am feisty , scrappy , and do n’t back down could be fatal .
But seriously , I feel confident I could hold my own .
You vlog and blog pretty often as a way to keep in contact with your fans , even going so far as to give people a glimpse into your private family life .
Even in this age of overexposed celebrity , do you feel like you have a responsibility to do this ?
Has it mostly been a good experience ?
I started blogging and vlogging because I do want to stay connected with the fans .
I do n’t know if I would say I feel “ obligated ” to do it , but I do know that I owe so much to my fans .
And I know they like me as a person .
Because on my show , I ’m not just a talking head reading a prompter or asking stupid questions like “ and how do you feel ? ” or “ who are you wearing ? ” I know they feel like they know me and in a way they do .
So , I like reaching out to them and giving them a closer look at me off air .
I might regret being so open , but right now I feel like I want them to be a part of my life .
If you met any of my fans , you would know that they are some of the most loyal friends , smartest and coolest people and you ’d want them in your world , too .
Because of your work on G4 you ’ve become a sort of geek / gamer sex symbol and you used to model when you lived in Japan .
What are the ups and downs of working in a business so concerned with your sex appeal ?
Pie .
I ca n’t eat all the pie I want .
On the show we answered a viewer question about how we stay in shape .
And in a moment of pure honesty , I confessed that sometimes I eat so much pie ( banana cream to be exact ) that I do n’t … correction , ca n’t button my size 25 jeans and go an entire show with my pants unbuttoned .
I think that there are so many bad body images out there .
We see all these celebrities that are so skinny and we think that ’s what beauty is .
And it ’s not just girls and women .
I was at an Academy Awards party recently in New York .
I was the only female amongst a sea of men .
And on the high - def flat screen we watched all of the beautiful stars walk the stage .
But , apparently they were n’t beautiful enough .
These men started talking about the upper arms of all these actresses .
The upper arms !
When did men stop talking about asses and boobs and start talking about upper arms ?
It made me realize that all these guys are influenced by the media just as much as us women .
They ’re so used to seeing all these super skinny girls be put on pedestals and they think “ oh , that ’s what ’s beautiful . ”
And I hate that .
Now we ’re all living up to some ridiculous , unhealthy image … and not just that –some men want us to be like that , too .
So I want to change the face of beauty because if there are more regular - sized , not perfectly toned , not artificially augmented women in the media , maybe that will be the new beautiful .
I ’m not saying we should n’t be healthy and workout , but we should n’t have to always fight to look a certain way .
It ’s okay to be a little soft in some areas and to not be super skinny .
Yes , I want to look like Giselle .
But , I do n’t .
I want to be happy with myself and I do n’t want pressure to be someone else .
And I think women all over should stand up and be at their physical best for themselves and know that whatever that “ best ” is , is beautiful .
What ’s the hardest part about doing live TV ?
Any horror stories ?
Live TV is so much fun , because you get one take .
So , if you mess up you learn to roll with it and laugh at yourself .
And you learn to improv a lot more … it keeps me quick on my feet .
My biggest problem is censoring myself … I ’ve been accused of “ not thinking before I speak . ”
But , if you know me , you ’d know that I ’m a quick thinker and talker .
The problem , is my censor .
I think of something crass or horrible to say , and I speak it .
The thought that goes through my head in the split - second before I say it is usually , “ Oh man , that ’s horrible .
I bet someone will laugh . ”
Like today I announced on air that I was n’t wearing panties .
It was kind of within the context of what I was talking about .
But still I said it .
That ’s live TV .
What do you miss most about Japan ?
I miss the tradition .
I love how rich and proud Japan ’s culture is .
When you ’re in Japan you really feel like you ’re there .
Sometimes when you go to a foreign country , you ’re like , “ Wow , it ’s so crazy to be here , next to the Colosseum … is that a McDonald’s ? ”
And it kind of takes you out of it .
But , in Japan , you ’re like , “ Holy crap !
That ’s Mt. Fuji…and there ’s a real life Geisha … and there ’s seaweed on my Filet o Fish ? ”
Even when they bring in outside / American influences , they give it their own touch .
You still feel like you ’re in Japan .
I love it there .
And miss it often .

The silver 25th anniversary is a wedding anniversary that deserves a big celebration .
Below are some 25th wedding anniversary gift ideas that will be both personal and meaningful .
The traditional and modern gift to symbolise the 25th Anniversary is silver .
As this is a milestone anniversary there are many gifts on the market .
Whilst it is a momentous date , the most precious gift you can offer is the one that comes from the heart .
This means that you do not heed to spend a lot of money on silver wedding gifts to show them how important the couple are in your life .
Some of the best gifts are those that you use your time , energy and skills to make yourself .
Love Always
If you want to give a rose symbolic of a silver anniversary , you can give a single stem rose , a bouquet or floral arrangement to adorn and scent their house .
If the couple have a garden , you can gift them a rose bush and let them know you ’ll take responsibility for planting the bush if they want you to .
There is a red rose named ‘ Silver Jubilee ’ or a pink rose ‘ Love Always ’ .
There are scores of rose names to choose that fit the anniversary theme .
Pick a rose that lets the couple know how much they mean to you .
Family Celebration
If you know the couple ’s wedding was n’t all they may have wanted or dreamed of , this is the time that family and friends can join with the couple to plan a big celebration .
At this celebration invite all the people that you can who attended the first wedding .
Social media and friends ’ reunited websites will help you track down people they have lost contact with .
The planning of such a celebration will be fun for the couple as they remember , and can now laugh over , the stresses of their wedding day .
Whether it was bad food , the bridal car turning up late or a terrible band that caused stress , be sure to get it right this time .
If you are planning a big celebration , the couple may like to renew their marriage vows in front of family and friends who were not at their wedding .
This is a good time for some mother and daughter bonding as mum looks for a new dress for the day .
Alternatively , if she has her original dress , this can be cleaned and altered if necessary .
Just the two of them celebration
A bottle of champagne so they can toast one another is a great gift .

Include photos of their wedding , their children , friends , homes they have lived in , trips taken together etc .
Pick a silver frame with a personal dedication to the couple and include a photo of them that you love , leave it empty so the couple can choose a picture of their own or include a gift token for a professional photographer to take a picture of the two of them .
Go online and create a photo - book with pictures and text contributions from family and friends far and wide who know the couple .
Creating the photo - book online means that you can share the log - in details and password to all you want to contribute so that they can upload their words and photos directly .
You can write a letter to the couple letting them know what they mean to you and how grateful you are for their help , assistance and friendship .
This may be the first time the couple find out the significance of their support to a particular friend or family member .
It ’s a great gift to be able to say thank you for all the couple have done .
Make it personal
Other gifts can be chosen depending on the interests of the couple you are buying for .
Personalised gifts are a great idea and show that you have put some research and thought into your gift .
You can personalise most things .

Do you know what your users are up to ?
More than ever , IT managers can answer " Oh , yes " to that query .
As corporate functions , including voice and video , converge onto IP - based networks , more corporate infractions are happening online .
Employees leak intellectual property or trade secrets , either on purpose or inadvertently ; violate laws against sexual harassment or child pornography ; and waste time while looking like they are hard at work .
In response -- spurred in part by stricter regulatory , legal and compliance requirements -- organizations are not only filtering and blocking Web sites and scanning e-mail .
Many are also watching what employees post on social networks and blogs , even if it 's done from home using noncompany equipment .
They are collecting and retaining mobile phone calls and text messages .
They can even track employees ' physical locations using the GPS feature on smartphones .
More often that not , IT workers are the ones being asked to do the digital dirty work , primarily because they 're the people with the technical know - how to get the job done , says Nancy Flynn , executive director of the ePolicy Institute .
Statistics are hard to come by , but Flynn and other industry observers agree that monitoring and surveillance are becoming a bigger part of IT 's job .
Michael Workman , an associate professor at the Florida Institute of Technology 's Nathan M. Bisk College of Business who studies IT security and behavior at corporations , estimates that monitoring responsibilities take up at least 20 % of the average IT manager 's time .
Yet most IT professionals never expected they'd be asked to police their colleagues and co-workers in quite this way .
How do they feel about this growing responsibility ?
Workman says he sees a split among tech workers .
Those who specialize in security issues feel that it's a valid part of IT 's job .
But those who have more of a generalist 's role , such as network administrators , often do n't like it .
Computerworld went looking for IT managers who would share their experiences and attitudes , and found a wide variety of viewpoints , ranging from discomfort at having to " babysit " employees to righteous beliefs about " protecting the integrity of the system . "
Read on for their stories .
Researchers at Queen 's University Belfast have discovered animal populations may often be under a much larger threat from parasites than previously recognised .
It is widely believed that the absence of parasites in species which ' invade ' ecosystems gives these ' invaders ' an advantage in their new homes ( the ' enemy release hypothesis ' ) .
But now , researchers from Queen 's have discovered quite the opposite , with the presence of parasites in these invasive species actually increasing the damage they can do .
The research was carried out by scientists in the School of Biological Sciences at Queen 's using invasive and native crustacean species from Belfast 's River Lagan and Lake Kiltonga in Newtownards .
The first results have been published in Biology Letters , a Royal Society Journal .
Explaining the significance of the finding , Dr Jaimie Dick from Queen's , Principal Investigator on the project said : " We have uncovered a significant threat from parasites which is lurking in our rivers and lakes , and which could have major implications for animal populations across the globe , the environment and the economy .
" It is widely known that ' invaders ' , those species which become transplanted from their native range , can have a negative impact on local invertebrates and fish stocks and cause wider ecological harm .
Now , we have made the discovery that the presence of parasites can actually increase , rather than decrease , the damage that these invaders can cause .
" Our experimental approach at Queen 's used a fresh water shrimp ' invader ' species as a first direct test of theory .
We found that this particular invader had more impact on our freshwater animals when it actually harboured parasites , than when it was without them .
This has significant implications for previous thinking , that when invaders are free from their parasites they do well in new locations .
" The next vital step for researchers worldwide is to use this information from Queen 's to help understand and predict the impacts of invasive species and their parasites .
This is a global research priority and if work is not carried out in this area , we could reach a situation where our native species disappear , ecosystem services are affected by issues such as water purification , and we suffer great economic losses .
In short , we need to protect biodiversity and reduce the economic impact of invaders . "
The next stage of the research will see how the effects of parasites propagate through entire communities , using experiments , surveys , new mathematical models and analysis of isotopes in body tissues that reveal the feeding history of invasive species in our freshwaters .
The Perfect Storm in the book and movie by that name refers to three large storms converging at a single place where a few humans are trying to survive .
What I am calling a perfect catastrophe is where several cyclic positive feedback processes converge and cause a life threatening situation for all humanity .
This is a little different because the possible processes included can be under human influence in the beginning although ultimately they develop into feedback events that are beyond human control .
Positive feedback cycles are those in which the outcome of some event makes it more likely that similar events will be fostered and grow in intensity in a self stimulating cycle .
Negative feedback cycles are the opposite — any given event causes similar events to diminish in intensity and come to stability .
Humanity is presently involved in several positive feedback cycles which will eventually lead to a catastrophic breakdown unless they all are somehow reversed into negative feedback cycles so they can be muted .
A few obvious positive feedback loops
Human overpopulation is already apparent but it ’s growing larger every day which creates a larger base for ever more children .
Human food demands on the environment are already well beyond unaided historical carrying capacity and humanity ’s food supply is being supported by artificial fertilizers created by mining one time usage materials such as oil , coal and phosphates .
Oil is being consumed by an ever accelerating growth of the number of cars , trucks , airplanes , and fertilizer needing crops .
With better communications like TV , internet and cell phones , more people are realizing ways to achieving a better life style which is more resource demanding and accelerating .
Military armaments are constantly improving and becoming more powerful which gives people opportunity for continually making them even more powerful .
Paul Ehrlich author of The Population Bomb lost his famous wager with Julian Simon when in 1980 he bet that resource scarcity would lead to higher commodity prices of chromium , copper , nickel , tin , tungsten in ten years .
The prices actually fell because of technological improvements of refining them .
Ehrlich had his time line set entirely too short , at ten years and far too specific .
Prophets that give a specific date for some catastrophe have always been wrong and it is far better to use Nassim Nicholas Taleb ’s Black Swan approach of likelihood rather than timing of an event .
A more specific but reasonable approach is to take a very long view of 10,000 years and measure whether a thing is likely to occur or not .
That is how long civilization has been thriving and might continue to thrive if it were to live as it did up until 200 years ago .
When one takes that long view and asks if humanity could sustain itself at the present population growth and consumptive mode the answer is obvious .
The metals listed above will probably be in short supply in 100 years which means that humans would have to find some other way to live for 99 % of a reasonable future civilized time .
Returning to the specific list of positive feedback loops , it is difficult to define what any of the words mean exactly but overpopulation is obvious when a crisis occurs .
For example , when the earthquake hit Haiti last year there was reported to already have been something near 80 % unemployment and to my way of thinking that meant there was something like 80 % overpopulation .
That method of estimating overpopulation lets the market decide which appears a better definition than some academic gobbledygook statement which I might conjure up .
Each of the items are similarly hazy when discussed in words and equally obvious when observing the physical facts .
Each of the listed items have a positive feedback component which is partly independent from the others but which worsens the impact of the others .
More people means more food consumed , which means more need for food and more fertilizer to make the food .
That means more consumption of oil , gas and phosphates which means more demand for those things which means more cars , trucks and other transportation to bring these things to the fields for growth and take them away for distribution to people .
The improvement in creating each of these things makes them more available which supports more people which see others around them having more goodies so they work out ways of getting more themselves .
This means more weapons to defend what they have acquired which cycles back upon itself .
Each of these things grows more the more it grows until something happens to reverse the positive feedback cycle .
At present no one wants to even consider slowing down the growth of consumption of any of these near luxuries ; thus it is obvious that some breaking point will be reached , sooner or later .
Because all of these positive feedback loops are operative and feed back upon one another it would seem our catastrophe will come sooner rather than later .
Converging of multiple feedback loops will cause a perfect catastrophe .
The division of labor at most companies is clear : Business development divines the big ideas , and IT toils to turn these concepts into workable software .
And yet as far as IT 's stature in the organization is concerned , this flow of ideas can no longer be in one direction and one direction only .
In fact , the IT department that willfully assumes the role of order - taker is increasingly at risk of being outsourced .
Luckily for IT , being on the front lines of new technologies has its privileges .
Marry this with an entrepreneurial spirit , and IT can assert a new relationship with the business by launching new , low - cost experiments geared toward exposing opportunities that those less familiar with today 's technologies can't foresee .
[ Also on InfoWorld : Keep your IT organization humming by avoiding the 7 deadly sins of IT management and IT 's 20 most common mistakes . ]
But to be taken seriously by the suits , IT must move beyond mere tinkering ; instead , purpose - driven testing and proven results , when brought back to the business team to help develop a plan that scales appropriately , is the key to shedding the " operations only " stigma and making the organization take notice of the ingenuity of IT .
Of course , developing a meaningful prototype requires more than just an understanding of the underlying technology .
It takes a level of cost - benefit analysis and insight into new revenue outlets that may not be as easy as the IT department would like to believe .
After all , balancing the competing interests of customers and suppliers is just as tricky as balancing the load of a server farm .
Here is where ambition can get the best of you .
To avoid getting burned , a small - scale , low - risk approach to experimentation is key .
Here are five technical areas where experimentation can help IT improve its stature with the business development team .
These are just a few examples of how IT can grow beyond keeping the server LEDs on and show the suits IT is a valuable partner when it comes to initiating revenue - minded projects .

The rise in violence comes amid a US troop surge and a major Nato offensive
Violence in Afghanistan increased dramatically in the first four months of this year , the UN says .
In a quarterly report to the UN Security Council , it said roadside bomb attacks rose by 94 % , compared with the same period in 2009 .
On average , the report said , there were three suicide bombings a week , half of them in the country 's volatile south .
The findings come amid a major Nato - led operation in Helmand and a surge of US reinforcements .
US President Barack Obama ordered 30,000 extra troops to Afghanistan in December .
Assassinations rise
And Nato launched Operation Moshtarak in Helmand province in February , its biggest military offensive since the Taliban were ousted in 2001 .
The alarming trend of increased improvised explosive device incidents and complex suicide attacks persisted UN Secretary General 's report Peace or more war ?
The report noted the rise in violence was " attributable to an increase in military operations in the southern region during the first quarter of 2010 " .
It also said Afghanistan 's overall security situation " has not improved " since the UN 's last report in March .
Despite all this , the electoral commission had successfully registered more than 2,500 political candidates - including 400 women - for polls due in September , the report said .
It also noted that both the Afghan police and army were slightly ahead of interim targets for beefing up their ranks .
But assassinations had risen 45 % , with the Taliban and others increasingly successful at killing Afghan officials , the report said .
It added that sophisticated suicide bombings had doubled from last year to roughly two per month .
" The shift to more complex suicide attacks demonstrates a growing capability of the local terrorist networks linked to al - Qaeda , " the report said .
It also noted : " The alarming trend of increased improvised explosive device incidents and the occurrence of complex suicide attacks persisted . "
' Tough fighting '
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon submitted the report to the Security Council this week .
Image caption Coalition - caused civilian casualty numbers are down , says a US general
Nato spokesman Brig Gen Josef Blotz told reporters in the Afghan capital Kabul on Saturday : " Tough fighting is expected to continue , but the situation is trending in our favour as more forces flow into the area . "
" It has to be tougher , perhaps , before it goes easier , " he added , reports the Associated Press news agency .
Gen Blotz also said there had been 44.4 % fewer civilian casualties in the last three months , compared with the same period in 2009 , due to more stringent rules of engagement .
Operation Moshtarak , involving 15,000 troops in the Marjah area of Helmand , has been hailed by Afghan and Nato officials as a success .
But there have been reports of ongoing violence , Taliban intimidation and a lacklustre performance from Afghan police and civilian administrators , say correspondents .
Nato - led forces are meanwhile poised to launch a long - planned offensive in the southern city of Kandahar , a stronghold of the Taliban .
According to a tally kept by the independent iCasualties website , more than 1,120 US soldiers and almost 300 British soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan since 2001 .
President Obama 's strategy envisages foreign troop numbers in the country peaking at 150,000 by August , before a US drawdown in 2011 .

The Future of RDF
Today ( 2010 - 06 - 26 ) and tomorrow , and workshop is about to take place about the future of RDF .
Whilst the scheduling of the workshop did not allow me to participate directly , I summarize here my probably well - known views about some aspects of the future of RDF at the bottom level .
This does not address the many other exciting things which need to be done in the semantic web , but just the RDF model and its common serializations .
Cleaning up the RDF model
Deprecate the form of reification in the RDF / XML spec .
Deprecate the bags and sequences from the RDF / XML spec , and produce a new document without it Produce a new RDF / XML document without the deprecated features Produce a new spec or perhaps tutorial which defines the model separately from any specific serialization , with examples from Turtle and maybe RDF / XML
In the RDF model , add the ability of the subject to take any of the forms allowed for the object .
Currently , this means including literals
In RDF / XML , extend the syntax so that a collection can be incorporated anywhere any subject or object .
Define a common JSON serialization .
How strong should the deprecation be ?
One possibility is for them to be just best practice notes .
It will have the great advantage of simplifying the documentation .
A transitional possibility for Sequences may to have them converted to lists as a parser option , for systems which handle lists and do n't handle sequences .
Extending the RDF model to allow N3
In RDF / XML , extend the syntax so that a graph can be incorporated anywhere any subject or object .
Extend the RDF model so that variables can take the place of S P or O .
Use the N3 model that , to allow nested graphs , the scope of quantification of a variable can be given explicitly .
Extensions to the RDF model should be done consistently with N3 to avoid unnecessary incompatibility .
Extending N3
Syntax : Allow naked literal ( limited , absolute , UTC ) date - times in W3C standard format e.g. 2010-06-26 or 2010-06-26T12:04 Z .
( This format is distinguishable from other numeric forms .
Date - times are a common and important datatype and reading and writing them with an explicit datatype is boring .
In practice people end up putting them in data on the web as strings which prevents processing software and user agents providing appropriate functionality )
A syntax for quote variables is necessary in order to write SPARQL conveniently in N3 .
In SPARQL at the moment one can write SELECT ?x , ?y WHERE ... where the variables are implicitly quoted .
To represent that in N3 model needs a form of back - quoting to indicate that the variables are being mentioned rather than used .
[ select ( ` ?x `?y ) ; where { ?x foo:bar ?y } ... ]
Ontologies on top of N3
Merge N3 rules and AIR rules , to make one common language .
AIR rules are written in N3 but use a different ontology ,
The rules are more complex , and as they are nodes in the graph they can be given URIs and so extended , unlike N3's { ... } => {... } which are single statements .
Note this is not a change to N3 . N3 rules and AIR are both ontologies which use the N3 model .
Extending N3 Including RIF features
Extend the N3 model to allow the direct expression of Nary functions .
Define the mapping of cwm-style " Binary function of Argument list " Nary functions as reifications of new Nary functions .
Extend N3 syntax to allow infix operator expressions and operator precedence .

On friday I got a phonecall .
It was an offer .
The sort you can't refuse .
Did I want to take a seat in a friends plane and go for a cruise to check out the erupting Eyjafjallajökull ?
Why yes , yes I did !
I was currently staring down the barrel of missing my trip to see Kata in Russia , due to cancelled flights all over Europe , but Iceland domestic flights , in the west at least , are completely uninterrupted .
Not really much else to say , we had a great trip !
Because of airspace restrictions we had to stay fairly high , so we could n't really see much of the jökulhlaup debris along Markárfljót , but we got a great look at Eyjafjallajökull itself , last months eruption site at Fimmvörðuháls , and of course , all the general beauty of Iceland 's landscape on a warm spring day .
The other guys caught some glimpses of lightning in the clouds , but I missed seeing that , but hopefully these will give you a bit of an idea of what it 's like .
It really makes Fimmvörðuháls look like the cutesy little tourist eruption that it was .
Even though that was damn cool and enormous when you walked up to it !
The Oklahoma City Bombing
What was the Army doing with a Ryder Truck just before the Murrah blast ?
The pilot who took the photos wishes ( for the obvious reasons ) to remain anonymous , but these photos are purported to be of an area near Camp Gruber - Braggs , Oklahoma in early April of 1995 .
Needless to say , just days after this photo was taken , the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City was destroyed ( along with internal cutter charges ) by a Ryder truck full of explosives .
NEW !
In a recently discovered news article written by the Washington Post on June 17th , 1997 , the Oklahoma National Guard authenticates the following photos as being exactly what they appear to be , photos of a Ryder truck in a clandestine base at Camp Gruber - Braggs .

( Dow Jones Newswires ) , June 14 , 2010
The federal government 's new wariness about offshore drilling in the wake of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill is dimming what may be the best hope for extending the life of the Trans - Alaska Pipeline , a crucial artery supplying one - quarter of the West Coast 's oil .
The 800 - mile pipeline , owned by a BP - led consortium , carries about 670,000 barrels of oil a day -- 13 % of U.S. production -- from Alaska 's North Slope the length of the state to Port Valdez .
From there it is sent by tanker to refineries in Washington and California .
That is a lot less than the two million barrels a day the pipeline carried at its peak back in 1988 , because of a rapid -- and probably permanent -- decline in Alaska 's onshore oil production .
Volumes may fall low enough to halt operations by the middle of the next decade without an expensive modification of the pipeline to handle less oil .
At a reduced flow , oil in the pipeline can freeze or form into a waxy buildup , raising the risk of interruptions and spills .
Offshore oil production could help refill the pipeline just when the flow from the North Slope is projected to reach critical lows .
But Alaska politicians , industry consultants and analysts question whether tight new regulations in the wake of the oil spill in the Gulf might discourage offshore drilling in the Arctic , removing that as a way to postpone the Trans - Alaska Pipeline 's decline .
The federal government has already ruled repeatedly that opening new onshore areas , such as the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge , to drilling would exact too great an environmental cost .
On May 27 , President Barack Obama ordered a six - month offshore drilling moratorium in the wake of the April explosion and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon rig , which killed 11 workers and started oil gushing into the Gulf .
The rig was leased by BP .
The president also commissioned an independent panel to recommend new offshore energy regulations .
The West Coast relies heavily on the pipeline for a cheap , domestic source of crude , and the region will need to pay a premium to ship in increasing amounts of foreign oil if Alaskan production continues to fall .
The rest of the nation would miss those volumes too .
Oil prices spiked in 2006 , when an oil spill in a BP - operated Alaskan field briefly threatened to cut off half of the state 's production .
" The way I think most Alaskans feel , the federal government wo n't let us go to the east onshore , they wo n't let us go to the west onshore , the only place to go is offshore , and they wo n't let us do that now , " said Kurtis Gibson , deputy director of the Alaska Division of Oil and Gas .
Royal Dutch Shell was awaiting the Interior Department 's final approval to drill up to five offshore wells this year when the moratorium was put into effect .
The ban effectively postpones any work in Alaska until at least next summer , as sea ice prevents winter drilling .
The oil spill has also rejuvenated a campaign by environmental groups and native coastal villagers to reduce the area of the Arctic open to oil exploration and overhaul drilling regulations .
A few weeks before the Deepwater Horizon disaster , the White House had expanded its plan to sell exploration leases in Arctic waters .
Oil producers warn that uncertainty about drilling in the Arctic may scare off oil companies willing to pay billions for a chance to find some of the last untapped U.S. oil reserves .
" Changing lease - sale schedules disrupts the certainty and consistency that industry needs for planning such investments for leasing and ensuing exploration and development , " Geoffrey Haddad , ConocoPhillips ' manager of Alaska exploration wrote in a letter to the Interior Department dated May 3 .

5. My Two Days at the FBI Headquarters
April 5 & 6 , Charlotte North Carolina : WOW !
I wish you could have been there .
After months of pushing Deke Falls , my do nothing " defense attorney , " I finally had the opportunity to review the paper files that were confiscated at the office in Evansville Indiana .
Please note this did NOT include any of the digital files on the half dozen computers and servers that were also taken in the raid on the Liberty Dollar .
And while , I was able to very quickly review the files there was no way to review all the material IN the 50 plus large files boxes .
Special FBI Agent Romagnuolo waited on me hand a foot for two full days because I was not allowed to touch anything until they were officially opened by the FBI .
Due to the limited time , I was only able to make a small dent into analyzing the vast amount of info in paper files and not even a moment for the digital files .
In total there is something like 1.8 million docs for defense to review .
Amazingly , I was lucky to select an unnamed file and find some of the most interesting info .
There is no doubt that the files will play a major role in our defense .
So , I spent two whole days with Romanuolo and his sidekick Deke Falls , my supposed " defense attorney " but never said a single word to Romagnuolo .
Just as I hoped it would be .
But I did share a few words with Falls .
When we had finished the second day and returned to the parking lot at this office I told Falls , " Now I do n't know if you are dumb as nails or just a front for the DOJ and quite frankly I do n't give a damn , you 're fired . "
I then promptly handed him the dismissal letter and drove off .
Then on May 3 , I was back in Charlotte for court that was supposed to be for the trial of the Liberty Dollar Four .
Of course , since Falls had not done any defense work , any trial was out of the question so the court focused on my dismissal of Falls and postponed the trial until July 6 .
But do n't hold your breath for that date , as a new attorney must be found to represent me , plus he is going to have to get up to speed for an acknowledged ' difficult and complex case . ' according to the judge .
6. Two Timely articles from GATA and Newsmax
1. GATA.org announced that GoldMoney founder and Free Gold Money Report ( FGMR ) editor James Turk , wrote that the U.S. dollar has reached its " Havenstein moment , " the point in time memorialized by the decision of the president of Weimar Germany 's Reichsbank to print as much money as necessary to allow the population to keep up with rising prices .
Turk 's commentary is headlined " Hyperinflation Looms - The Dollar Arrives at Its ' Havenstein Moment ' . "

2. The Financial Times reveals that the Congressional Budget Office projects that U.S. Debt will hit $ 20 Trillion in 10 Years , cumulative US deficits will reach $ 9.7 trillion and federal debt 90 percent of gross domestic product - nearly equal to Italy's .

7. Cabool Dollar Merchant Directly
As we reported last month , Joshua Deathridge has issued the Cabool Dollar for the greater good of central Missouri .
The article referenced the Merchant Directory that was complete with advertising and info on all the merchants who use the Cabool Dollar .
Unfortunately the link in the March issue of the LDN did not work .
Please click HERE for an example of Joshua 's fine work .
He is doing a lot more than talking about making changes .
He is doing it !
Congratulations Joshua on your fine efforts to aid the economic system in central Missouri .
8. Tenth Amendment and the Liberty Dollar
It does n't seem like a day goes by without another state declaring its sovereignty in one way or another .
As reported by BeforeItIsNews.com :
New York State Senator Michael Nozzolio ( R - 54th District ) has drafted and introduced J4716 , a resolution to " Re-Establish New York State 's Sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment . "
See http://open.nysenate.gov/legislation/bill/J4716
According to the introductory text this Legislative Resolution , affirms , " the sovereignty of the of the people of the State of New York pursuant to the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States . "
The resolution continues by requesting , " Congress cease and desist from enacting mandates that are beyond the scope of the enumerated powers granted to Congress by the Constitution of the United States . "
The legislation also seeks to establish a joint committee on the constitutionality of acts , orders , laws , statutes , regulations and rules of the government of the United States of America in order to protect state sovereignty . "
This introduced legislation resides in the Senate 's Finance Committee where it was referred on Friday , April 16 , 2010 .
Current co-sponsors include Senators Larkin , Maziarz , Seward , Farley , Johnson O , Ranzenhofer , Winner , Alesi , Lanza , Morahan and Young .
In his remarks accompanying the legislation , Nozzolio reminds his fellow Senators , " For the last fourteen months , the U.S. Congress and the President have tried everything they could to consolidate total power in the federal government . "
Apparently , Albany is beginning to understand that " We the People " have become increasingly frustrated and concerned since January 21 , 2009 .
The Senator also displays his recognition that the healthcare legislation is only the latest in a long list of federal actions that are in direct violation of the constitutionally enumerated and limited powers granted the federal government by the states and the people .
While this may not mark the end of the battle for the protection of state and individual rights , it may fire a warning shot across the bow of the federal ship of state to let Congress and the President know that the patriots slogan of " Do n't Tread On Me " is alive and well in the State of New York .
People are urged to call , write , fax , email and visit their elected state representatives and demand that they support this ( J4716 ) and Seward 's S7374 legislation to protect their rights and limit the power of the federal government .

One of these days a destitute state is going to realize that they do not have to be the whipping child of the federal government and take matters into their own hands .
Just as the federal government has turned over the monetary powers to a private organization , aka the Federal Reserve , a state can enter into such a relationship with a private party and save their economic ass and everybody who lives in that state with the State Monetary Initiative proposed by the Liberty Dollar .

9. Sick Legal Update
Last month I reported , the " Ugly truth " as the government tried " every dirty trick to force Kevin to accept a plea bargain . "
That was incorrect .
The really sick , dirty truth is that Kevin 's own court appointed " legal counsel " is doing the devil 's work by pushing Kevin really hard to accept a plea !!!
Of course , this makes sense because the DOJ is barred from contacting Kevin without his attorney present .
So , Ms. Claire Rauscher , his own " legal " counsel , who is supposed to be defending him , is acting as nothing more than a front for the DOJ and worthy of the " Federal Pretender " moniker ... if not in more expressive words .
BTW , another unique strength of Kevin , is that he never cusses .
But that does not mean you should n't , ca n't or that I am urging you to do anything outside of your own good conscience .
But it is high time for somebody to tell Kevin 's " Federal Pretender " to start working for Kevin 's defense or go to hell !
It 's been almost a year ... and Ms. Rauscher , his " Federal Pretender , " has done NOTHING but try her best to coop him into the hands of the DOJ .
This thick headed ***** does not seem to understand that the more she pushes , the more resistance she creates .
Plus misrepresenting her client 's interest is unethical and actionable after the Liberty Dollar Four wins .
So if you have a dog in this fight , if the government confiscated some of your property or if you are just half as pissed - off as I am , please express yourself directly to Ms. Rauscher that you want her to win the case for the defendants NOT the DOJ .
And remember to be as polite as possible , or as strong as you feel about the government , its dirty tricks , its action against the Liberty Dollar and / or your own property .
Please send your comments to :
Ms. Claire Rauscher
Federal Defenders Office
129 West Trade St .
Suite 300
Charlotte NC 28202
BTW : The mission of the Federal Defenders of Western North Carolina , Inc. is to provide high quality representation to indigent defendants .
In achieving this mission , this program will endeavor to : ( 1 ) provide the highest quality of legal representation ; ( 2 ) advance the effectiveness of the legal system through excellence in legal scholarship and through ongoing education and training of the criminal defense bar and the community ; ( 3 ) foster and promote high standards and ideals engendered by the Bill of Rights and the Criminal Justice Act ; and ( 4 ) see that justice is administered on a fair and equal basis .
OH ...
So you do n't think telling the government 's paid Federal Pretender where to go is worth 44 cents ?
No problem , just email her : Claire_Rauscher@fd.org and BCC me Bernard@LibertyDollar.org .
And remember to keep your comments as friendly and positive as possible ... as they are trackable ...
But it is not just Kevin 's Federal Pretender who is lying and trying her best to coop him into the hands of the DOJ !
Sarah Bledsoe and Rachelle Moseley 's Pretenders have been caught lying while they tried to play one defendant against the other to no avail .
And this BS passes as a legal system ?
And while it may be " legal , " well as legal as in " legal tender , " it is certainly not honorable !
The criminal legal system and its " attorneys " are just a pack of liars ******** and that is being kind as I struggle not to cuss as Kevin does n't !
As reported above , I fired my lying , do nothing , BS attorney , Deke Falls .
And while Falls could not use the same intimidating tactics on me as Rauscher uses on Kevin as he sits in jail , Falls never would discuss a defense strategy , constantly argued on behalf of the DOJ and at one point he even said I was guilty !
Really great POS defense attorney , eh ? !
Meanwhile , the jail is now limiting books that can be sent to Kevin , plus they can't be hardcover , etc ...
So if you wish to support Kevin , it is better to send money to his wife who has opened a bank account for Kevin and she will keep him supplied with his favorite books and money for food to support his vegetarian diet .
Please send your 44 cents or whatever you wish to :
Julia Gaunt
16 Norman Austin Dr .
Asheville , NC 28804
I know Kevin greatly appreciates everything you send as he now faces his first anniversary in jail for trying to save the US monetary system with the Liberty Dollar .
Please continue to cheer him on via a letter to :
William K. Innes
2351 Morganton Blvd. SW
Lenoir , NC 28645
Closing Remarks :
During these long days , weeks and months of pushing the Liberty Dollar Four case to be heard , your continued support is greatly appreciated .
For it is only by banding together and adopting a free and independent currency that provides us with " just weights and measures " will we be able to throw off the yoke of a manipulated monetary / tax system and generate a peaceful and prosperous society .
Thanks for all your efforts to return America to value - one Liberty Dollar at a time !

June 9 , 2010  --
Before his four - decade career in politics , Jerry Brown briefly entered a Jesuit seminary .
It is that monkish sense of austerity with which the California Democrat plans to run against a billionaire Republican gubernatorial opponent with virtually bottomless coffers .
If elected , Brown , 72 , will be the oldest sitting governor in the United States .
A fixture of California politics and the state 's current attorney general , Brown was governor from 1975 to 1983 and ran three unsuccessful presidential campaigns .
" It 'll be a tough fight .
Maybe the toughest , " Brown said of the upcoming general election against newly minted Republican candidate Meg Whitman , the former CEO of eBay who spent $ 80 million during the primary and has pledged to spend as much as $ 150 million of her own money in her bid to become governor .
" I 'm going to be as frugal as I can , " Brown told ABC News ' Diane Sawyer .
He used the words " frugal " or " frugality " several times in the course of the brief interview .
Austerity , he said , begins at home .
" We need now to reset , " he said .
" So austerity , some frugality , and I know how to do that .
When I was governor , I got rid of the jet .
I did n't live in the mansion . "
" Are you going to do that again , " asked Sawyer .
" No plane for you ?
No mansion for you again ? "
" No , " said Brown .
" Well , there is no mansion . "
Brown said he is prepared for a difficult battle in which Whitman will blitz California 's airwaves and voters ' mailboxes with a message that is fiscally conservative and promises job creation .
" Every hour , maybe every 15 minutes , everyone 's going to hear the opponent 's message .
That is quite extraordinary , " he said .
Brown , just a day after winning his party 's nomination , went on the attack , assailing Whitman 's lack of political experience , the timing of her pay raises as CEO , and her record on job creation in the private sector .
He claimed some jobs she was created were " exported " out of the state .
Meg Whitman declined to be interviewed by ABC News .
During her speech accepting the Republican nomination on Tuesday , Whitman launched her own opening salvo against Brown , calling him a career politician and lambasting his record on employment and education while in office .
" Jerry Brown has spent a lifetime in politics , and the results have not been good , " she said .
" Failure seems to follow Jerry Brown everywhere he goes .
It 's a record of promising much and delivering little , of saying one thing , and then doing quite another . "
She blamed Brown for high unemployment and massive state spending during his two terms as governor from 1975 to 1983 and for Oakland 's poor performing schools when he served as that city 's mayor from 1998 to 2006 .
In a November interview with ABC News , Whitman said : " If you want a different approach , if you want a more business - like approach , if you want someone who knows how to create jobs , and knows how to focus , then I 'm your person .
If you want a different person , then you should vote for that .
But I will talk about my strengths in this race , which is different from a career politician , Jerry Brown or otherwise . "
Brown used a question about whether he would take an unpopular position within his party against organized labor to compare the difficulties of being a state executive against those of being a corporate executive .
" When I was governor , when I saw an excessive employee pay raise , I vetoed it -- not once , but twice , " he said .
" I know how to stand against the storm .
This is not like being a CEO , where you 're in a private board room .
You got the media .
You 've got the opposition party .
You have a lot of emotions .
" We 're in trouble , " he said of California , a state with one of the world 's largest economies and a $ 6 billion deficit .
" California is in a mess . "
Brown said companies that hire new employees should be entitled to tax credits , but he opposed Whitman 's plan to give tax breaks to the wealthy .
" [ Whitman is ] going to cut all the taxes on the rich , like herself , and that 'll somehow create jobs , " he said .
" That 'll increase and exacerbate the gap . "
A counterculture icon of the 1970s , Brown was nicknamed Gov. Moonbeam for a proposing the state buy a communications satellite .
Brown said even at 72 , he has no lack of energy .
He runs and does pull - ups every morning , he told Sawyer .
A former seminarian who studied Buddhism in Japan and a volunteered in India with Mother Theresa , Brown found a spiritual message in his campaign .
" Well , at the end of the day , what really is this all about ? " he asked .
" The fundamental quest is : How do we touch our spirituality ?
How do we touch that innermost part of our being ?
And how are we open to that same thing in other people ?
" That 's the intimacy , the spirituality , that you do n't normally find in politics , " he said .
" But it 's the other side .
After everything quiets down , you 're still yourself .
And there 's still life and death .
When I was studying in Japan , before you 'd mediate ... in the evening , someone would hit a block a few times .
And then someone would intone : ' Life and death is a serious matter .
Time waits for no man .
Do your best . '
And that , I think , could be the spirit of this campaign . "
The election of South Carolina 's Democratic Senate candidate should be questioned , according to Senior White House Advisor David Axelrod .
NBC 's David Gregory asked David Axelrod Sunday if Alvin Green 's election was legitimate .
" It does n't appear so to me .
It was a mysterious deal , " Axelrod responded .
" The whole thing is odd .
I do n't really know how to explain it and I do n't think anybody else does either . "
" I think the Democrats of South Carolina deserve a strong , credible candidate .
He would argue I suppose that he won the primary so that would be him .
How he won the primary is a big mystery , and until you resolve that I do n't think he can claim to be a strong , credible candidate , " said Axelrod .
Most sentient beings have long recognized that murdering civilians in foreign countries -- especially through the cowardly methods of " secret war " -- is entirely counterproductive ... if your actual aim is to enhance America 's national security by reducing violent extremism and hatred for the United States , that is .
However , if your aim is to perpetuate and expand a militarist empire and the bloated , brutal , corrupt , war - profiteering system that supports it , why then , secret war and civilian slaughter are perfectly logical and remarkably effective methods .
And that is why our highly intelligent and cool , pragmatic president is now vastly expanding the use of secret war , subversion , sabotage and murder into even more countries around the world , and giving America 's secret , unaccountable death squads and covert operators even more power to carry out their lawless operations .
As one Pentagon mandarin gushed , Obama is allowing " things that the previous administration did not . "
That quote comes from a remarkably candid story in the Washington Post on Obama 's " surge " in America 's secret war on the world , which now encompasses no fewer than 75 countries .
( By the way , the Post is often a very good source of information about the operations and machinations of the militarist empire -- not because its editors are seeking to expose the empire 's crimes and atrocities , but because they approve of them .
And thus they will often write about them , in detail , in the most straightforward manner : " Hey , look at the cool stuff our boys are doing now ! " )
As the story notes :
The Obama administration has significantly expanded a largely secret U.S. war against al - Qaeda and other radical groups , according to senior military and administration officials .
Special Operations forces have grown both in number and budget , and are deployed in 75 countries , compared with about 60 at the beginning of last year .
...
Plans exist for pre-emptive or retaliatory strikes in numerous places around the world ...
What 's more , Obama has brought the covert operators and death squad leaders into the inner circle at the White House :
Special Operations commanders have also become a far more regular presence at the White House than they were under George W. Bush 's administration , when most briefings on potential future operations were run through the Pentagon chain of command and were conducted by the defense secretary or the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
" We have a lot more access , " a second military official said .
" They are talking publicly much less but they are acting more .
They are willing to get aggressive much more quickly . "
The White House , he said , is " asking for ideas and plans . . . calling us in and saying , ' Tell me what you can do .
Tell me how you do these things . ' "
... Obama has made such forces a far more integrated part of his global security strategy [ than Bush ] .
He has asked for a 5.7 percent increase in the Special Operations budget for fiscal 2011 , for a total of $ 6.3 billion , plus an additional $ 3.5 billion in 2010 contingency funding .
The story notes that the bureaucratic turf wars between the Pentagon and State Department that had hindered some covert operations under the cantankerous Donald Rumsfeld have now disappeared with the smooth comity between Obama 's team of Hillary Clinton and Robert Gates , the long - time Bush Family factotum who now mentors the eager young Democratic president in the ancient ways of oligarchy and militarist empire .
And of course , Obama hand - picked Stanley McChrystal -- master of America 's darkest arts in the war of aggression in Iraq -- to lead his " surge " in Afghanistan .
Indeed , Obama has been so lavish and relaxed in his use of death squads and secret war that the only complaint voiced these days by our Special Oppers -- who , the Post notes , " consider themselves a breed apart " -- is that they have to spend too much time in current war zones , and not enough plying their wares in new territory :
Although pleased with their expanded numbers and funding , Special Operations commanders would like to devote more of their force to global missions outside war zones .
Of about 13,000 Special Operations forces deployed overseas , about 9,000 are evenly divided between Iraq and Afghanistan .
Yes , it 's a lot more fun to skulk around in unsuspecting foreign nations , " taking out " a suspect here , " renditioning " another to some secret hellhole there , arming and funding local terrorist groups to kill , maim and destroy , or paying off sleazy local informants who happily sell their business rivals or personal enemies into captivity .
It is indeed a noble calling , requiring " a breed apart " from the common herd .
But oddly enough , some of the Pentagon 's compadres in covert war are discovering that the practice is not achieving its publicly stated objectives .
As Gareth Porter at Antiwar.com reports , even the push - button killers of the CIA are waking up to the fact that their remote - control slaughter of Pakistanis with drone - fired missiles is creating more hatred and more enemies for the United States :
Some CIA officers involved in the agency ’s drone strikes program in Pakistan and elsewhere are privately expressing their opposition to the program within the agency , because it is helping al - Qaeda and its allies recruit , according to a retired military officer in contact with them .
" Some of the CIA operators are concerned that , because of its blowback effect , it is doing more harm than good , " said Jeffrey Addicott , former legal adviser to U.S. Special Forces and director of the Center for Terrorism Law at St Mary ’s University in San Antonio , Texas , in an interview with IPS .
Addicott said the CIA operatives he knows have told him the drone strikes are being used effectively by al - Qaeda and Taliban leaders to recruit more militants .
...
Because the drone strikes kill innocent civilians and bystanders along with leaders from far away , they " infuriate the Muslim male , " said Addicott , thus making them more willing to join the movement .
The men in Pakistan ’s tribal region " view Americans as cowards and weasels , " he added .
Weasels ?
Well , that is a " breed apart , " I guess , so perhaps the covert warriors should be proud of the sobriquet .
( And of course it is not just the Muslim male who is infuriated by the civilian slaughter and turning to violent reaction , as evidenced by the growing number of female suicide bombers . )
But these inklings of CIA sentiency -- and perhaps the first stirrings of awareness that the stated objectives are not the real aim of the program -- have not prevented our stalwarts from continuing to push their murderous buttons ( or is it click their murderous mouses ? ) :
CIA officers " are very upset " with the drone strike policy , Addicott said .
" They ’ll do what the boss says , but they view it as a harmful exercise . " ... Addicott said the drone program has been driven by President Barack Obama , rather than by the CIA .
" Obama ’s trying to show people that we ’re winning , " he added .
Addicott then makes this telling observation :
They have informed high - level CIA officials about their concerns that the program is backfiring , Addicott told IPS .
" The people at the top are not believers , " said Addicott , referring to the CIA .
" They know that the objective is not going to be achieved . "
And there you have it .
The " people at the top " are indeed well aware that the stated objectives of the ever - expanding drone program -- and the ever - expanding Terror War -- are not going to be achieved .
They are not meant to be achieved .
They are meant only to give the illusion " that we 're winning , " to keep the great game going , to keep the money and the power rolling in .
When you saw the Hale - Bopp comet , you may have seen material from a distant star passing by .
In a new study , a team of astronomers argues that most of the comets that streak through our solar system were actually born in other solar systems .
Given their eccentric orbits and infrequent visits , comets seem like worthy candidates for an exotic origin .
But the prevailing thinking said no , they are rather ordinary .
Researchers thought most of the comets that pay us a visit initially formed from the sun 's protoplanetary disk — the same swirling mass that formed our own planet — and came to reside in the weird Oort cloud region at the periphery of our solar system .
From there , the gravitational bullying of larger bodies can dislodge a few like Halley 's Comet or Hale - Bopp , which swerve into an orbit that sees them visit the inner solar system now and then .
In a study in Science this week , researchers led by Harold Levison posit a different idea : Many of the comets hanging around our solar system are stolen .
It goes like this :
Like most stars , the sun may very well have been created in a tightly nestled birth cluster , a stellar nursery with tens , hundreds or possibly even thousands of stars .
During millions of years of intimate infancy , the newborn stars could have exchanged vast numbers of comets from the fringes of their disks , each of them winding up with an ensemble of hand - me - downs from their stellar siblings [ Scientific American ] .
The idea arose because the Oort cloud
itself does n't make sense under the long - standing interpretation of comet origins .
The researchers argue that the Oort cloud 's 400 billion objects could not have all originated from within the solar system :
There are about 70 times fewer objects there than needed to explain the Oort cloud 's size .
Therefore , the team argued , a large portion of the material that makes up the Oort cloud had to come from somewhere else [ Los Angeles Times ] .
Levison 's team found that this material " from somewhere else " could constitute as much as 90 percent of the Oort cloud .
Other astronomers had proposed the same idea in decades past , but lacked the computing power to model such a scenario .
As computing power marches ever upward , these models of the solar system
may prove more and more ideas to be possible :
Just two days ago we reported on a separate team that finally had the computing power to model the formation of Saturn 's tiny moons , showing that they could have formed from the planet 's rings
.
Then again , a model is just a model .
Julio Fernandez , an astronomer with the University of the Republic in Uruguay , said the study was interesting but relied on several assumptions .
Among them : that the sun formed in a star cluster ; that every star in such a cluster formed a planetary system with a comet swarm around it , just like ours ; and that the sun was close enough to other stars in the cluster to be able to capture an entire comet cloud [ Los Angeles Times ] .
Even the population of the cloud itself , which spurred this question of alien comets , is just an estimation .
The Oort cloud is a hypothesized region that extends to the most distant extent of the sun 's gravitational influence — maybe even halfway to the nearest foreign star .
Guessing how many objects reside there is n't a shot in the dark , but it 's no exact science , either .

Image Credit : Frederick M. Brown / Getty ImagesWe ’re uncertain of whether it ’s due to redundancies , but Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant ’s film Cemetery Junction will be heading to the dreaded straight - to - DVD rack in the U.S.
That ’s an indignity usually reserved for the likes of Steven Seagal and Gervais ’ Extras character Andy Millman .
The film is a surprisingly somber coming - of - age tale set in a dream - killingly small British burg .
Not exactly a larff riot , but it might have been interesting to see the comedic duo stretch their wings .
Plus , it ’s not like The Office did n’t have its share of hanging on in quiet desperation , which is , after all , the English way .
I think I ’ll probably pick up the movie once it makes it ’s way to stores on Aug. 17 , if only to see what happens when Gervais and Merchant get serious .
But what I ’m really interested in is when we ’re going to see a Karl Pilkington movie .
Or a documentary about the quest for a boy who can swim faster than a shark .
What do you think , PopWatchers ?
Disappointed that Cemetery Junction wo n’t be hitting a theater near you ?
Sad to see it consigned to the straight - to - DVD bin , or is that not necessarily a fate worse than death ?
" It 'd be cool if you guys come out more often . " chimed in a cyclist also on the subway .
Others agreed , as well many others on Twitter .
Surrounded by a small group of excited cyclists on the subway late Friday night , Sgt. David Krumer had a positive outlook on the event .
" We were happy that it went as well as it did , " he said , " but of course it could have gone better . "
He said there were only a handful of incidents , including some arrests for vandalism , fireworks set off in Hollywood and a cyclist who was hit by a car in West Hollywood .
By all accounts , Friday night 's first Critical Mass ride that shared the road with hundreds of cyclists and cops was a success .
And it was also a completely opposite scenario from last month when the LAPD used force against cyclists , causing an uproar within the bicycle community and Chief Charlie Beck promising that things would improve .
Damien Newton at Streetsblog called the night an " overwhelming success . "
" For one night , the fractured bicycling advocacy community put aside it 's own internal divisions and rode as one , " he wrote .
Some had mixed feelings , a sense stemming from anticipation of how this will all play out in the future .
" I feel a little uneasy with what happened tonight - it ’s hard for me to believe that such a positive relationship can persist , " wrote Alex Thompson at BikesideLA .
" But today I believe that I witnessed the death of antagonism between two great powers in Los Angeles , the two gutsiest powers in LA ’s streets - cyclists and LAPD .
I look forward to , with courage and clear purpose , exploring this new and undiscovered country of friendship and support . "
Commander Jorge Villegas said the ride was a success from the police department 's perspective .
" We learned a lot and will use the lessons learned to be even better prepared .
We look forward to our continued relationship / partnership .
With this partnership , Im hopeful that we will continue to work on our short and long range issues , " he wrote in an e-mail Monday morning to cyclists .
" Further , Im hopeful that with what the cyclist community experienced this Friday , it will continue to ride in lawful manner illustrative of integration with the flow of traffic .
By doing so , cyclist demonstrate a solution to traffic congestion and possible solution to our city 's traffic problems . "
One issue the LAPD will be facing is how to deal with corking intersections .
On Friday night , the front of the group obeyed red lights , but once the mass of cyclists was flowing , it was hard to stop .
" Although it was n't our intent , it was kind of an organic thing , " Krumer explained .
Krumer and other officers will meet this week to debrief and figure out how they can improve the ride even more .
Cyclist Joe Borfo , who called for a project called " Civil Obedience " thanked the LAPD publicly .
" I think this really is a symbol of the LAPD reaching out and showing that they will support and respect the bike community , " he wrote .
" In return , let 's show them that we can ride in traffic AS TRAFFIC by following all the rules of the road . "
Critical Mass , a large monthly bicycle ride , meets the last Friday of every month at 7:30 p.m. , starting above ground at the Metro Wilshire and Western stop .
Many years ago I created , developed , perfected and marketed Wiggly ® Brand Mayonnaise — the richest , creamiest , wiggliest mayonnaise in the south .
I made the mayonnaise myself ; the first experimental batch I made in the bathtub turned out chunky and too yellow .
After that ( and following my wife ’s accident ) , I was forced to move my mayonnaise lab down to the basement .
It was trial and error for the first couple of months as I tried to find new and exciting ways to improve and invigorate mayonnaise .
But once I perfected it and got it just right it was beautiful .
So thick you could lay on it .
I knew I had created a mayonnaise that would go far beyond being a condiment for food .
The applications of Wiggly ® Brand Mayonnaise would be endless …
I bottled it in mason jars and sold it out of my home .
Once word of mouth about my mouthwatering mayonnaise spread all around town , I started selling it at the farmer ’s market .
Soon I had the grocers and druggists begging me to let them sell my mayonnaise .
That meant I had to make much more mayonnaise .
During the summer months I recruited some strapping young interns from the schoolhouse .
I could n’t pay those young lads much ( a dollar a day plus all the mayonnaise they could carry home in their pockets ) but I was able to give them the one thing they wanted most : Sense of Accomplishment .
For me , it was more than just male bonding and mayonnaise in my sweltering hot basement .
That was probably the best summer of their lives .
Soon I worked out a distribution deal with Piggly Wiggly supermarkets to test out Wiggly ® Brand Mayonnaise at half a dozen of their stores in Tennessee and Kentucky .
Unfortunately , Big Mayonnaise — Hellmann ’s , Blueplate , Duke ’s , Zippy ’s , Gold Medal and , of course , the behemoth of them all : Kraft and their vile Miracle Whip — ran me out of town .
The big food companies pretty much dictate how much supermarket shelf space is made available for all products , not just their own .
Especially mayonnaise !
I got about six inches on the bottom shelf , barely enough space for a single jar - wide row , and close enough to the floor where the cleaning crew ’s floor scrubbers and waxers would dirty up my mayonnaise mason jars on a nightly basis .
I never had a fighting chance .
I only sold a few cases and after just three months Piggly Wiggly sent me packing .
That was the beginning of the end .
The dark days of mayonnaise had come .
I still make mayonnaise for my own consumption and for gifts ( look out Secret Santa ! ) but I ’m out of the mayonnaise selling business for good .
Too many bad mayonnaise memories .
Those were the golden days of mayonnaise , long before mayonnaise culture was sullied by cheap gimmicks like light mayonnaise , vegenaise ( who could love you ? ) , and wide - mouth jars .
Back then it was about the mayonnaise .
Ask me anything about my mayonnaise business or about mayonnaise in general .
I consider myself an expert on the subject .
I ’ll even share my mayonnaise inclusive recipes ( like my triple fudge mayonnaise cake made with real mayonnaise ! ) .
Mayonnaise has limitless uses beyond food .
Ask me about what mayonnaise can do for you .
Have a question about mayonnaise ?
Ask me anything about mayonnaise !
Want to make Wiggly Mayonnaise at home ?
Here ’s the recipe !
After the lake began to flow through the spillway that was cut into the landslide debris on May 29th , the flow of the water has increased , but still does not match the inflow upstream from the Hunza River .
And - as is evidenced by these two images ( May 30th on the left , June 4th on the right ) , the outflow is eroding the debris , working back toward the lake - potentially signaling an upcoming breach where nearly five months worth of river flow might wash away the dam and cause serious flooding downstream .
Scientists and authorities are monitoring the situation and evacuations have been undertaken for all threatened areas .

Check is an excellent unit - testing framework for C code , used by a number of relatively well - known projects .
It includes features such as running all tests in separate address spaces ( using fork ( 2 ) ) , which means that the test suite can properly report segfaults or similar crashes without the test runner crashes .
My main complaint about Check is that ( unsurprisingly for a framework written in C ) , it ’s not very declarative .
After you define all your tests as separate functions , you need to write code to manually collect them into “ test cases ” , which you then collect into “ test suites ” , which you can then run .
While this is an understandable interface for a C library to provide , as a user I found that it rapidly annoyed me , and so I wrote Check Plus .
Check Plus is a simple library I wrote that uses some preprocessor tricks and GNU C extensions to provide a declarative EDSL within C for declaring and collecting your test cases .
Check - Plus is a single self - contained header file distributed under the LGPL ( like Check ) , so it should be easy to pull into your project .
Check - Plus lets you declare your Check suites and test cases in a declarative manner .
A simple example , shipped with Check - Plus , would look like :
#include < string.h > # include < stdlib.h > # include " check - plus.h " # define SUITE_NAME example BEGIN_SUITE ( " Example test suite " ) ; # define TEST_CASE core BEGIN_TEST_CASE
( " Core tests " ) ; TEST ( strcmp ) { fail_unless ( strcmp ( " hello " , " HELLO " ) != 0 ) ; fail_unless ( strcasecmp ( " hello " , " HELLO " ) == 0 ) ; } END_TEST TEST ( strcat ) { char buf [ 1024 ] = { 0} ; strcat ( buf , " Hello , " ) ; strcat ( buf , " World . " ) ; fail_unless ( strcmp ( buf , " Hello , World . " ) == 0 ) ; } END_TEST END_TEST_CASE ; #undef TEST_CASE END_SUITE ; #undef SUITE_NAME
Having done that , you can extract the declared test suite using construct_test_suite ( example ) , and run it using the standard Check test runner tools .
You can , of course , define multiple test cases within a single suite , and you can even define test fixtures using
DEFINE_FIXTURE ( setup , teardown ) ;
within the BEGIN_TEST_CASE … END_TEST_CASE block .
The equivalent code , without Check - Plus , would look similar , but instead of the BEGIN_ and END_ blocks to define the suite and test case , you ’d have to write something like :
Suite * example_suite ( void ) { Suite *s = suite_create ( " Example test suite " ) ; /*
Core test case */ TCase * tc_core = tcase_create ( " Core tests " ) ; tcase_add_test ( tc_core , test_strcmp ) ; tcase_add_test ( tc_core , test_strcat ) ; suite_add_tcase ( s , tc_core ) ; return s ; }
It ’s not a huge difference , but it ’s big enough that I really appreciate it once the test suite gets large .
For more documentation on Check , check out its manual .
Let me know if you find this useful for anything .
Next week , I ’ll do a writeup on the tricks behind the implementation .
On June 15 , 2010 , the BBC's Hardtalk program broadcast an wide - ranging interview with Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez from the Miraflores Presidential Palace in Caracas .
The interviewer , Stephen Sackur , clearly intended to provoke Chavez with a series of ill - informed and outright dishonest claims and questions .
He did not succeed .
Parts 2 and 3 below .
Part 2
Part 3
How the media misreports Venezuela , even when given full information
CEPR co-director and South of the Border co-writer , responds to Stephen Sackur ’s article in ( also posted on the BBC site ) :
Stephen Sackur ’s article is quite prejudiced and could use some journalistic objectivity , even if the author is against President Chávez and everything he stands for .
I was there for the interview , and saw Chávez respond with concrete answers , some that would be quite convincing to a neutral observer , but I do not see any of these points included .
It seems that the author included only rhetorical points that Chávez made about capitalism , etc. , rather than trying to allow the reader to hear the other side of the story .
We can only hope that the televised interview does not selectively edit for the same effect .
It is possible to write an article that is highly critical of Chávez – if that is the author ’s intention – without so much exaggeration , and misleading or inaccurate statements .
Below is the original article with comments pointing out some of the most glaring examples :
Hugo Chávez grants rare interview to Western media
By Stephen Sackur .
The Guardian .
June 13 , 2010
Venezuela ’s president , Hugo Chávez intends to inject new urgency into his socialist , anti-imperialist revolution because , he says , there is clear evidence that “ capitalism is destroying the world ” .
In a combative 60 - minute interview with the BBC Hardtalk programme in the presidential palace in Caracas , Venezuela ’s president blamed his country ’s deepening recession on the irresponsible economic policies of the US and he expressed disappointment with Barack Obama ’s “ very negative signals ” towards Latin America .
“ I wish Obama would focus on governing the United States and would forget his country ’s imperialist pretensions , ” the 55 - year - old leader said .
Chávez rarely grants extended interviews to the western media .
[ What is “ rarely ? ” Chávez did interviews recently with Larry King , Barbara Walters , Ted Koppel , John Lee Anderson ( of the New Yorker , twice ) , not to mention CNN en Espanol just weeks ago . . . many others that I do n’t have in front of me .
Has Lula or any other Latin American president given more “ extended interviews ” than Chávez has to western media ?
I ca n’t recall anyone who has . ]
This one was arranged to coincide with the Caracas premiere of Oliver Stone ’s new documentary , South of the Border .
The film portrays a Latin America being transformed by leftist radicalism .
The leaders of Brazil , Argentina , Bolivia and Ecuador all get walk - on parts , but it is their Venezuelan counterpart who has the starring role .
Stone and Chávez shared a limousine to the red carpet launch of the film in Caracas ’s national theatre .
“ What ’s being going on in Venezuela for the last 10 years is amazing – a piece of history .
The least I can do is introduce this man and this movement to the American people , ” said Stone , Chávez beaming by his side .
Whether many Venezuelans will ever see the film remains unclear .
The premiere was full of Socialist party bigwigs and activists who hooted with delight as their president was seen lambasting George Bush , beating off a coup attempt in 2002 and generally adopting the mantle of a 21st - century Castro .
But no amount of support from a maverick US film - maker can disguise a simple truth ; domestic support for Chávez ’s “ Bolívarian socialism ” is being sorely tested by a second consecutive year of recession .
[ This is a somewhat exaggerated commentary .
There are no reliable polls in Venezuela , and the ones cited in the press are almost always opposition , but still I cannot find any recent poll , even from an opposition polling firm such as Datanalisis that shows Chávez with less than majority support .
Most importantly , I cannot find any poll showing that people identified with the opposition come close in numbers to those who identify as pro-Chávez .
If the author has empirical support for this statement , he should cite it .
( Ed. Note – Bloomberg cited a Datanalisis poll in an article published after the writing of this response .
The poll shows Chávez with an approval rating of 48 percent , a 6 percent increase from the previous month .
According to Gallup , this approval rating is the same as President Obama’s .
Unlike in reporting polls in the United States , where partisan pollsters are reported as Republican or Democrat , Datanalisis is reported in neutral terms .
José Antonio Gil Yépez , the current President of Datanálisis , has been quoted in the Los Angeles Times as saying of President Chávez , “ He has to be killed . ” )
Also , just to clarify with regard to “ a second consecutive year of recession , ” at worst the recession could be said to have started in the first quarter of 2009 , in which case we can say that it has been in recession for one year , or possibly 1.25 years .
( By the most common definition of recession , 2 consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth , we have at most 3 quarters of recession , i.e. less than one year ) .
The point here is not to argue that the author should go into the technicalities of measuring the business cycle , but his wording does make it sound worse than it is . ]
Venezuela possesses the biggest oil reserves outside the Middle East and supplies more than a tenth of US oil imports , but still the economy has woefully underperformed others in Latin American in the last two years .
[ This is misleading .
A number of countries in Latin America did worse than Venezuela over the last two years , including , most prominently , Mexico .
The majority of countries in the hemisphere had negative growth in 2009 .
We have only one quarter of data for 2010 . ]
Inflation is at 30 % and seems likely to rise further .
[ Chávez answered this by pointing out that inflation was higher in the decade before he took office , including hitting more than 100 percent in 1996 and 40 percent in 1998 . ]
The Venezuelan currency , the bolívar , has been devalued [ This is a good thing , it should be devalued further .
This is a common mistake among non-economists , to think that a “ strong ” – i.e. overvalued – currency is good for the economy , and a devaluation necessarily bad . ]
and is still sinking among Caracas ’s parallel market money changers .
In the capital ’s sprawling hillside barrios jobs are scarce
[ Jobs are much less scarce than when Chávez took office , with unemployment at 7.9 percent in 2009 compared to 15.3 percent in 1999 , something Chávez also mentioned .
Total employment also increased quite substantially during these years , from 84.7 to 92.1 percent of the labor force .
An article like this would never mention it , but the vast majority of these jobs were created in the private sector .
I gave this data and more to the author , but he did not seem interested .
Here is a report on the first 10 years of the Chávez presidency that highlights some of these key points . ]
and Chávez ’s party is looking electorally vulnerable just three months before parliamentary elections .
[ This is not yet clear ; in a non-presidential year election , turnout will be decisive , as only about 1/3 of the electorate typically votes .
Chávez ’s party has a sizeable organization with 7 million members ; the opposition has nothing comparable .
In the absence of data , this is little more than wishful thinking .
Of course , many outcomes are possible . ]
He blamed the economic woes squarely on America ’s “ rampant , irresponsible capitalism ” which was taking the world “ on the road to hell ” .
“ In England and in Europe you should know this , ” he said .
“ You have more problems than we do . ”
Chávez quoted a stream of economic statistics to illustrate his claim that his 11 years in power had “ begun to redress the balance between a very rich Venezuelan minority and a very poor majority ” – unemployment halved , extreme poverty down from 25 % to 5 % , he said .
[ I find it remarkable that the vast changes in Venezuelan society that explain why this man was re-elected 3 times , each time with a larger majority , are reduced to this one sentence referring to “ a stream of economic statistics ” cited by a source that the media has demonized and therefore is not likely to make a dent in the overwhelming negative thrust of this article .
As I explained to the author , these are vast improvements by any historical or international comparison , and these statistics are accepted and used by the World Bank , the UN Economic Commission on Latin America , and other international statistical agencies .
These statistics are no less internationally accepted than those of the UK .
And this does n’t even include that poor people now have free health care , and vastly expanded access to education ; social spending per person has more than tripled .
( The poverty and extreme poverty rates are based only on cash income . )
See this report for more information . ]
Domestic critics of his nationalisation programme – which has turned the oil , power and agriculture sectors into vast state bureaucracies [ The oil industry was nationalised in early 1976 , when Chávez was still a young man of 21 .
I ’m not sure what the author means by a “ vast state bureaucracy ” in power or agriculture . ]
– accuse him of creating a “ Bolívarian bourgeoisie ” of corrupt officials and cronies .
[ Accusations are fine , but some evidence would be more convincing . ]
But Chávez emphasized he intended to go further with his socialist model .
Privately owned enterprises are now being expropriated [ Few if any nationalizations have taken place without compensation , for example , in the oil industry all foreign companies were bought out so that the government could have its legal majority share ; some 29 of 33 accepted the government ’s offer ; the others went to arbitration in a court friendly to the oil companies . ]
with increasing frequency – a recent controversial example involved the French - owned Exito supermarket chain after allegations of profiteering and currency manipulation .
“ Eleven years ago I was quite gullible , ” he said .
“ I even believed in a third way , I thought it was possible to put a human face on capitalism .
But I was wrong .
The only way to save the world is through socialism , but a socialism that exists within a democracy ; there ’s no dictatorship here . ”
But a crackdown on opposition [ Crackdown ?
What is a crackdown ?
One media owner who uses his ownership of a large media outlet as a political weapon against the government has an arrest warrant against him – selective prosecution , perhaps , but I was just watching his station last week and they were still showing anti-government propaganda that would not be shown even on Fox News in the United States .
This is not to defend such isolated incidents – of which there have been only a handful in the last 11 years -- but why does the author have to exaggerate so much , giving a false impression that the media is intimidated or subject to a “ crackdown , ” when most of it is still controlled by the opposition ?
Why not just report it as it is , that Venezuela ’s media is one of the most oppositional in the hemisphere , certainly more than the U.S. , although there have been a few arrests in the last 6 years or so for things like criminal libel laws ( which I am of course against but do exist even in some European countries ? ) .
Certainly the author can be harshly critical of any such actions without creating such a grossly exaggerated picture of the reality of press freedom in Venezuela . ]
was highlighted last Friday with an arrest warrant issued for the owner of the TV channel Globovisión , which takes a critical line against Chávez .
[ This is also misleading , did he get arrested for “ taking a critical line against Chávez ? ”
If so , the vast majority journalists in Venezuela would have to be arrested too . ]
Guillermo Zuloaga has since gone into hiding , but he recently told Hardtalk : “ I have the right to have my own personal opinions and to say whatever I like about Mr Chávez … he has to be able to accept criticism . ’
“ The socialism that Chávez is looking for is just a way to manufacture poor people . ”
During the interview Chávez became visibly agitated when questioned about his government ’s respect for an independent judiciary , freedom of the press and the rights of political opponents .
[ I saw this interview , and it was much more of a debate than an interview .
The author was engaging Chávez in a debate , sometimes Chávez had to fight to get in a response .
There ’s nothing inherently wrong with this format , but it ’s not surprising that Chávez might get agitated – I have never seen an interview of this nature , not from the late Tim Russert or any journalist known for challenging questions and follow - ups – it was a debate format , not an interview format , without a moderator . ]
As the tension rose Oliver Stone , who was seated in a corner listening intently to the exchanges , gestured to the president with both hands .
The message was easy to read : calm down .
Chávez claimed Venezuela ’s press was “ 100 times more free than that in the US ” , but when challenged over the recent suspension of the privately run RCTV , ostensibly for failing to abide by a legal requirement to air his numerous ( often very long ) [ This too is very misleading , the legal dispute was about whether RCTV was an “ international ” station , as it unsuccessful tried to litigate , and therefore not subject to domestic regulation , or whether it was a domestic station . ]
addresses to the nation , he again went on the attack .
“ Another lie of yours .
You ’re a great compiler of lies .
Where did you get these huge lies from ?
Listen , are you a qualified journalist ? ”
It ’s not Chávez ’s domestic record that most concerns the west ; it ’s his determination to create an “ axis of unity ” with those he sees as fellow strugglers against western imperialism .
He lists the leaders of China , Russia , Syria and Belarus as “ good friends ” , along with Iran ’s President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
[ Chávez answered this quite succinctly ; his closes allies are democratically elected leaders like Lula , he even mentioned Berlusconi as a good friend .
He also pointed out the media ’s extreme prejudice in only pointing to his friendships with “ enemies ” of the US . ]
In the last three years Tehran and Caracas have strengthened military and intelligence co-operation while deepening trade ties , and Chávez responded indignantly to the latest round of UN sanctions against Iran .
“ Venezuela is a free country and we will not be blackmailed by anyone .
We will not accept being told what to do over Iran , we will not accept being anyone ’s colony , ” said Chávez .
[ Neither will Brazil or NATO member Turkey , by the way . ]
But he categorically denied claims frequently aired in the US that Venezuela is supplying Iran with uranium .
[ Huh ?
Venezuela does n’t even produce uranium .
Sorry , this is ridiculous .
What else should Chávez be forced to “ categorically deny ? ” ]
His disappointment with the US president was expressed in highly personal terms .
“ I shook Obama ’s hand and I said , ‘ I want to be your friend . ’
My hand is still outstretched .
I am not Obama ’s enemy but it ’s difficult not see imperialism in Washington .
Those who do n’t see it , do n’t want to see it , like the ostrich . ”
The president did have a dialogue with the last Democrat in the White House , and that memory seems to have sharpened his disillusionment with Obama .
‘ I said to Hilary Clinton in front of President Obama , ‘ I wish I could enjoy the same relationship with a US president that I had when your husband was in power . ’ ”
Chávez refused to say whether he would seek another term in elections scheduled for 2012 .
Though few doubt that he will , having pushed through the abolition of term - limits in a hard - fought referendum and he has spoken of ruling until 2030 .
“ Fidel has spent his whole life on his [ revolution ] , ” Chávez said .
“ Whatever life I have left I will dedicate to this peaceful democratic revolution in Venezuela . ”
The world ’s major economic powers are all suffering from the economic downturn but even the most cynical doomsayer is sure we ’ll get ourselves out of this mess — eventually .
Rare are those instances in which entire economies are disrupted to the point – typically as a result of rampant inflation , or hyper inflation – that an entire form of currency is discarded , reformed or replaced .
But it does happen .
There are invariably external issues ( military , political , etc ) at play , which result in what can generally be referred to the ‘ failure of a currency ’ , and each situation is unique .
The following is a list of nine notable examples in which currencies became so devalued that they were eventually replaced :
Germany Weimer Republic 1922 -1923
wikimedia
By the end of 1922 Germany found it was no longer able to pay the war reparations set forth by the Treaty of Versailles .
French and Belgian armies responded by occupying Germany ’s most productive , and industrial regions .
German industrialists then ordered workers strikes , which put further pressure on an already frail economy .
The German government countered this situation by printing unbacked currency with which it meant to pay both workers benefits , as well as its delinquent international debt .
Supply and demand followed : too much money was circulated , and the money was soon considered worthless .
In 1922 , the largest denomination of the Papiermark was 50,000 .
A year later it was 100 Trillion .
This means that by December 1923 , the exchange rate with the US Dollar was 4.2 Trillion to 1 .
It is estimated that by November 1923 , the yearly inflation rate was considered 325,000,000 % .
This means that the cost of goods were increasing about every two days .
As a result , the Rentenmark was introduced at a rate of 1 to 1 Trillion of the Papiermark .
Reparation payments eventually continued , and France and Belgium agreed to leave the country .
Hungary 1945 - 1946
wikimedia
The Great Depression put an initial strain on the Austrian Pengo , originally introduced with great strength as a replacement to the Austrian - Hungarian Korona in 1926 , per the Treaty of Versailles .
Next , the associated effects of World War II would run their course .
In 1944 , the Hungarian Pengo ’s highest denomination was the 1,000 note .
A year later it was 10,000,000 .
And by mid-1946 , it was 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 .
Realizing that this type of hyperinflation and denomination increase was not sustainable – and after 20 short years – the Pengo was replaced by the Forint .
There are famous pictures of this event , which include street sweepers cleaning the sea of Pengo notes that Hungarians so eagerly discarded .
At the time of this replacement , the Pengo to Forint exchange , was Four Hundred Octillion ( That ’s 29 Zeros ) to one .
That same Forint would exchange for 11.74 to $ 1USD .
Inflation has since continued at a much more subdued rate , and the current exchange is valued at approximately 195.2 Forint to 1 $ USD .
It is estimated that at the time of replacement , the value of all Hungarian currency in circulation equaled less than one - thousandth of one US dollar !
Chile 1971 - 1981
wikimedia
Shortly after the ascension to the office of president , Socialist President Salvador Allende , decreed that many of Chile ’s leading industries would be nationalized .
Owing predominately to management problems ( with bureaucrats overseeing the market ) this government soon began hemorrhaging money , and in order to subsidize the loss , the Chilean Central Bank began printing unbacked currency at an alarming rate .
This resulted in an inflation rate of 600 % by the end of 1972 ; inflation eventually skyrocketed to 1200 % by the end of 1973 .
This was the same year General Augusto Pinochet ’s US - backed coup d’état seized control and installed his populist military regime .
Shortly thereafter , in 1985 , the Escudo ( 1960 - 1975 ) was replaced by the New Peso at a rate of 1,000 to 1 .
Except for a slight depression in 1981 , the Chilean economy recovered , largely due to the government ’s decision to sell off newly acquired State - owned enterprises .
The rest of Pinochet ’ s tenure in Chile , however , is entirely another story .
Argentina 1975 -1992
wikimedia
After unprecedented annual growth rates and record trade surpluses , panic and political unrest broke out between Argentine Trotskyists and the Perón loyalists , in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis .
Conflict came to a head in 1975 , when a sharp recession looked inevitable .
The Argentine government then exacerbated the situation by refusing to borrow in order to cover its budget and trade deficits .
In 1975 , the largest Argentine Peso denomination was 1,000 .
A year later the 5,000 note was introduced .
In March 1976 , a violent coup was staged by the country ’s military leaders , who promised to bring stability to the region .
By ’ 79 , there was a 10,000 Peso banknote and by 1981 , the Argentine Central Bank had introduced a 1,000,000 Peso note .
The country ’s economy declined , further worsening the situation – in between 1981 and 1982 , Argentina ’s GDP fell 12 % , the worst single year decline since The Great Depression .
When the currency was reformed in 1983 , 1 Peso Argentino was exchanged for 10,000 of the “ old ” Peso .
Then in 1985 , the ‘ Austral ’ was introduced , which replaced the Peso Argentino at a rate of 1 - to - 1,0000
Then yet again , in 1992 , the New Peso replaced the Austral this time at 1 - to - 10,000 .
This end result of this experience – in many circles referred to as , “ The March of Zeros ” – equated to a 1 New Peso equal to 100,000,000,000 Pre -’83 Pesos .
Peru 1988 - 1991
wikimedia
During the 1980s , Peru , like many Latin American countries introduced a number of trade liberalization polices .
At the same time , government increased public spending , privatized enterprise , and neglected to service the nation ’s external debt .
As a result , by the end of the 1990s , Peru ’s already small economy – which once had been enticing avenue for foreign direct investment – was experiencing not only negative economic growth , but also deficits of all types , as well as hyperinflation .
While hyperinflation became apparent , the Peruvian government replaced the Peru “ Old ” Sol with the Inti , in 1985 , at a rate of 1,000 to 1 .
The largest denomination of this new currency , was a 1,000 note .
In two years , monthly inflation would increase by a rate of 132 % in September 1988 , and later 400 % by September 1990 .
In order to facilitate the new higher prices of goods and services , new notes were introduced such as the 10,000,000 Inti note by 1991 .
Again , Peruvian government decided again to replace the currency , this time with the Neuvo Sol , at a rate of 1,000,000,000 to 1 .
The result was a currency that was worth one billion times that of only six years before .
Angola 1991 – 1999
wikimedia
Angola ’s story is an unfortunate one , and while it is today one of the fastest growing economies in the world , the country was plagued by civil war from 1975 to 2002 .
This conflict placed a large strain on the nation ’s economy , as well as its currency , the Kwanza .
In 1991 , the largest note was the 50,000 kwanza denomination .
By ’ 94 , there was the 500,000 banknote .
In 1995 , the Readjusted Kwanza ( Kwanza reajustado ) was introduced for 1,000 Kwanzas .
The new currency also had a 500,000 denomination .
When the country changed currencies in again in 1999 , the New Kwanza was introduced , exchanging for 1,000,000 of the reajustados ; by this time , the new currency was equal to one billion of the pre-’91 Kwanzas .
Yugoslavia 1992 -1995
wikimedia
Between 1988 and 1989 , the Yugoslavian Dinar ’s largest denomination switched from 50,000 to 2,000,000 notes .
The New Dinar replaced the Dinar in 1992 , at a rate of 1 to 10 , with the highest denomination being 50,000 .
By 1993 , this was 10,000,000,000 .
In answer to this sharp increase inflation , the government simply removed six zeros , meaning that the “ Newer ” Dinar replaced the “ Old Dinar ” at a rate of 1 to 1,000,000 .
In the next year the currency was replaced yet again , this time at the rate of 1 to 1,000,000,000 !
By January 1995 , prices had increased a quadrillion percent in two years , and as a result the German Mark became the country ’s Fiat currency .
It is estimated that during the height of hyperinflation ( December 1994 ) , inflation was increasing by a rate of 100 % per day .
In fact many Yugoslavians during this time sought to forgo paying their bills for as long as possible , because it several weeks the amount owed would seem relatively cheap !
Belarus 1994 - 2002
wikimedia
Shortly after the Cold War , many of the newly independent Eastern Bloc states began to experience the pains of a currency fluctuation , and moving towards a market - based economy .
At the time of independence , Belarus was had a relatively highly developed economy , and it ’s citizens experienced a standard of living among the highest of eastern Europe .
In 1993 , the largest Belorussian note denomination in circulation was the 5,000 Rubles .
By the end of the decade , this had increased to 5,000,000 notes .
In an effort to displace this , the government replaced the new Ruble at an exchange rate of 1 to 1,000 “ old ” Ruble .
Presently , the highest denomination is the 100,000 note , which is equal to 100,000,000 1993 Ruble .
Many people credit the high rates of inflation to the leadership of Lukashenko who has been in office since 1994 .
Today 80 % of the country ’s industries are still nationalized .
Zimbabwe 2000 - 2009
wikimedia
When Zimbabwe became an independent African state in 1980 , the Zimbabwe dollar was actually valued higher than the US dollar , at a rate of 1 to 1.25 .
Through a series of questionable race - based land seizures and rampant money - printing , the Zimbabwe dollar began to experience rampant inflation by the early 21st century .
By 2004 , inflation reached a then - all time high of 624 % , before going below triple digits in 2005 , and then surged up to to 1,730 % in 2006 .
In August 2006 , the currency was replaced with a New Zimbabwe dollar at a rate of 1 to 1,000 .
By mid-2007 , inflation reached a yearly increase of 11,000 % .
By May 2008 , 100 Million and 250 Million New Zimbabwe Dollars ( ZWD ) denominated notes were released , and less than two weeks later , a 500 Million ZWD note was introduced ( valued at about $ 2.50 ) .
Then less than a week later , 5 B , 25 B and 50 B ZWD notes were introduced , and later , in July , a 100 B denomination was introduced .
In August 2008 , the government removed ten zeros from the currency , and 10 Billion ZWD became equal to 1 New ZWD , with an estimated annual inflation rate of about 500 quintillion ( 18 zeros ) percent , with a monthly rate of 13 billion percent .

How bailing out the rich created the Depression
The other day , Krugman wrote that we ’re in the beginning of a new Long Depression .
Forgive me , but he ’s wrong : this is n’t the beginning , it ’s been going on for about two years now .
During a Depression there are periods where GDP grows .
There are periods where jobs grow .
It ’s just that the periods of job growth do n’t last .
There were opportunities to end the Depression before it really dug in its heels .
The last one was at the beginning of Obama ’s term .
Kicking out of the Depression required two things .
The first was an adequate stimulus .
This did n’t just mean a large enough stimulus , though the one offered was not large enough , it meant one properly constructed .
Tax cuts for ordinary Americans are not stimulative , because folks like banks who have pricing power ( you must have a credit card , loans , etc… ) will simply take that money away by raising rates and fees .
And it does n’t mean short term shovel - projects , it means making commitments which will last for years so that businesses , when making plans know that hiring is worth it because those employees will be needed for more than a year or so .
Likewise the US has some serious problems with the structure of the American economy .
The cornerstone of the stimulus had to be reducing US dependence on oil because as long as the US economy is so dependent on oil , full fledged growth is simply not possible .
The days of $ 20 / barrel oil are n’t coming back , and every time the price of oil gets too high , it puts great pressure on the US economy ( and every other modern nation . )
The second thing which had to be done is to force the banks to actually eat their losses .
Wipe out the shareholders and let the bondholders take their losses .
All the money plunged into the banks ( and it was much more than the TARP money , which was the smallest part of it ) was wasted .
Banks are not lending , and restoring lending is what the bailouts were sold as doing .
Moreover they have raised borrowing rates and fees on those who need credit most , soaking up money which otherwise would be helping the economy rather than simply being sopped up to plug holes in bank balance sheets .
The trillions of dollars spent attempting to bail out the banks were n’t just wasted , by keeping zombie banks alive they made the situation worse .
Further by not wiping out the wealth of banks and those rich folks who made foolish investments which wrecked the world economy , they created a political problem : to whit , as Durbin said — the banks still own Congress .
( Along with the military industrial complex , pharma and various other monied interests ) .
Because monied interests still own Congress , they have made it impossible to fix America ’s structural problems .
Six percent of GDP could have been saved by doing health care reform properly , but that did n’t happen .
The current “ financial reform ” bill under consideration is so week that I do n’t know of one credible outside analyst who thinks it is sufficient to make sure there is n’t another financial crash , and on and on .
Historically speaking periods of high concentration of wealth only end when the rich lose it in a huge crash .
They are never ended by , say , high marginal taxation — high marginal taxation only occurs after the losses have occurred as those who saw the run-up do their best to make sure it ca n’t happen again .
That lasts until the generations who saw the mania and crash start dying off and losing power .
So you start seeing really serious decreases in marginal tax rates and slashing of financial regulations when the generations who lived through not just the Great Depression but the Roaring twenties were no longer around .
The cliche that a crisis is an opportunity is , sadly , true .
But it is only an opportunity if you take it .
What politicians , and this includes Obama and Geithner , as well as Bush , Paulson and Bernanke , did , was they protected the rich from their own folly , and made ordinary people pay for it .
The wealth of the rich has mostly recovered , corporate profits have recovered , but for ordinary people the economy still sucks and there is no reason to believe it is n’t about to start sucking even more .
The financial elites think that what they can do is create an economy with a permanently high unemployment rate and that Americans ( and Europeans , for that matter ) will put up with it , because what choice do they have ?
We are going to have another kick at this can , because the legislation being put in place is not sufficient to prevent another financial crisis .
This is a Depression , and it is not going to go away .
Next time I hope we will consider doing the right thing .
Make those who crash the system take their losses and break the power of the rich over government .
Be very clear , it ’s you , or it ’s them .
You break their power , or they will continue to push your wages towards parity with China .
And they are very determined it ’s not going to be them .
Are you determined it ’s not going to be you ?
Frank Bank , who played Wally ’s friend Lumpy Rutherford , recalled taking a quart of melted ice cream ( which , he confessed in an interview , was actually yogurt ) over the head in “ Wally ’s Weekend Job ” ( Season 5 , Episode 6 ) .
Ken Osmond  the slick , weaselly Eddie Haskell , one of the most memorable characters television has ever seen  spoke of receiving a faceful of differential fluid in “ Wally ’s Practical Joke ” ( Season 6 , Episode 35 ) .
Jerry Mathers , the Beaver , still cringes at “ Beaver , the Bunny ” ( Season 5 , Episode 16 ) , in which he ended up in a ridiculous rabbit suit for a school pageant .
( The episode gave Lumpy the opportunity to utter the memorable line : “ Beaver in a bunny suit .
The only thing that would be funnier would be a bunny in a beaver suit . ” )
And Mr. Dow cited “ Wally , the Lifeguard ” ( Season 4 , Episode 4 ) , in which Wally thinks he has been hired as a lifeguard but finds himself hawking hot dogs instead .
“ They put a goofy - looking hat on me , ” Mr. Dow recalled .
Yes ,
Wally is still saying “ goofy . ”

It seems like a perfect instance of brotherly rivalry that , when asked to choose his favorite episode , Mr. Mathers picked the show that Mr. Dow named as his most humiliating .
But that ’s an illusion ; Mr. Mathers said his selection was based on the memory of the down time between scenes , when he outfished Mr. Dow in what is now called Jaws Lake on Universal ’s back lot .
Mr. Dow named as his favorite “ Happy Weekend ” ( Season 2 , Episode 13 ) , a wise , wistful tale in which the boys ’ father , Ward ( Hugh Beaumont ) , drags them against their will to the cabin where he used to vacation as a child .
Like so many of the series ’s best installments , that one was written by the show ’s creators , Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher , men apparently obsessed with bathing .
The subject comes up seemingly in every episode , including “ Happy Weekend . ”
“ Hot dog , Beaver ! ”
Wally says as the boys are looking over the cabin .
“ There ’s no bathtub ! ”
Maybe the cleanliness fixation was a manifestation of the way Mr. Connelly and Mr. Mosher ran their operation : protectively , Mr. Dow said , with an eye out for the negative influences that have derailed so many child stars since .
“ There were drugs and alcohol when we grew up , but we had this tremendous core of support , first from our families , but also from the writers and others who worked on the show , ” Mr. Dow said .
“ I remember there was this crewman who said ‘ dammit ’ or something once .
Never saw him again . ”

Image caption Loggerhead turtle nests are threatened by the Gulf of Mexico oil spill
Scientists in the US have announced a plan to rescue sea turtle nests and eggs from the potential impacts of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
The " Sea Turtle Late - Term Nest Collection and Hatchling Release Plan " has been put together by the US Fish and Wildlife Service ( FWS ) .
This aim is to collect nests at a point in the incubation cycle where there is the lowest risk of losing viable eggs .
Researchers are currently locating and marking nests .
Sandy MacPherson , FWS national sea turtle coordinator , said : " Data on the nest location and the date deposited are being closely tracked .
" This allows us certainty in timing the nest collection phase of the plan . "
Once collected , the nests will be packed in protective boxes and transported to a " climate - controlled location on the east central coast of Florida " .
They will remain there until the eggs hatch , and scientists will then release the turtles - mostly endangered loggerheads - on east central Florida beaches .
The project will start within the next few weeks and will collect nests from the Florida Panhandle and Alabama beaches in the northern Gulf area , which is at the highest risk of oil contamination .
Some of the brightest C++ minds had been working on concepts for years , only to vote them out of the C++0 x spec–unanimously , not long after they ’ve been voted in .
In my naivete I decided to write a short blog post explaining why in my opinion it ’s still worth pursuing concepts into the next revision of the Standard .
I showed a draft to my friends and was overwhelmed by criticism .
The topic turned out to be so controversial that I was forced not only to defend every single point but to discuss alternative approaches and their pluses .
That ’s why this post grew so large .
What Are Concepts ?
In a nutshell , concepts are a type system for types .
Below I have tabled corresponding features and examples of non-generic programming with types vs. generic programming with concepts .
The concept Iterator specifies the “ type ” of the type parameter , T , which is used in the definition of the template function , Count .
Regular Programming Generic Programming functions , data structures template functions , parametrized types
Example :
int strlen ( char const * s ) template < Iterator T >
void Count ( T first , T last ) parameter : s type parameter : T type : char const * concept : Iterator
Just to give you a feel for the syntax , here 's an example of a concept -- a simplified definition of Iterator :
concept Iterator < typename T> : EqualityComparable <T> { typename value_type ; T& operator ++( T& ) ; ... }
Iterator illustrates both the simplicity and the complexity of concepts .
Let me concentrate on the simple aspects first and leave the discussion of complexities for later .
Iterator refines ( inherits from ) another concept , EqualityComparable ( anything that can be compared using ' == ' ) .
It declares an associated type , value_type ; and an associated function , operator ++ .
Associated types and functions are the bread and butter of concepts .
You might have seen something like an " associated type " implemented as a typedef , value_type , in STL iterators .
Of course , such typedefs are only a convention .
You may learn about such conventions by analyzing somebody else 's code or by reading documentation ( it so happens that STL is well documented , but that 's definitely not true of all libraries ) , but they are not part of the language .
You use concepts when you define template functions or parametrized data structures .
For instance , here 's a toy function template , Count :
template < Iterator T> int Count ( T first , T last ) { int count = 0 ; while ( ! ( first == last ) ) { ++ first ; ++ count ; } return count ; }
As you can see , this function uses two properties of the concept Iterator : you can compare two iterators for equality and you can increment an iterator .
Ignoring the fine points for now , this seems to be pretty straightforward .
Now , let 's see what problems were concepts designed to solve .
Who Ordered Concepts ?
Besides being an elegant abstraction over the type system , concepts offer some of the same advantages that types do :
Better error reporting
Better documentation
Overloading
Error Reporting
Why do templates produce such horrible error messages ?
The main reason is that errors are detected too late .
It 's the same phenomenon you have in weakly typed languages , except that there error detection is postponed even further - - till runtime .
In weakly typed languages an error is discovered when , for instance , a certain operation cannot be performed on a certain variable .
This might happen deep into the calling tree , often inside a library you 're not familiar with .
You essentially need to examine a stack trace to figure out where the root cause of the problem is and whether it's in your code or inside a library .
Conversely , in statically typed languages , most errors are detected during type - checking .
The fact that a certain operation cannot be performed on a certain variable is encoded in the type of that variable .
If the error is indeed in your code , it will be detected at the call site and will be much more informative .
In current C++ , template errors are detected when a certain type argument does not support a certain operation ( often expressed as the inability to convert one type to another or a failure of type deduction ) .
It often happens deep into the instantiation tree .
You need an equivalent of the stack trace to figure out where the root cause of the error is .
It 's called an " instantiation stack " and is dumped by the compiler upon a template error .
It often spans several pages and contains unfamiliar names and implementation details of some library code .
I suspect that the main reason a lot of C++ programmers still shun template programming is because they were burnt by such error messages .
I know that I take a coffee break before approaching a template error message .
Self Documentation
The only thing better than early error detection is not making the error in the first place .
When you 're calling a function , you usually look at its signature first .
The signature tells you what types are expected and what type is returned .
You do n't have to study the body of the function and the bodies of functions that it calls ( and so on ) .
You do n't have to rely on comments or off - line documentation .
Signatures are the kind of documentation that is checked by the compiler .
Even more importantly , at some point the compiler also checks the body of the function you 're calling to see if its arguments are used in accordance with their declared types .
Contrast it with template programming .
If the " signature " of a template is of the form template < class T > , you have no information about T .
What kind of T's are acceptable can only be divined by studying the template 's body and the bodies of templates it is instantiating .
( And , of course , the compiler can do nothing to check this " signature " against the template body . )
The Case of STL
Even if you 're not defining templates in your own code , you probably use them through the Standard Library -- STL in particular .
STL is a library of algorithms and containers .
Alexander Stepanov 's stroke of genius was to separate the two .
Using STL you may apply one of the 112 algorithms to 12 standard containers .
It 's easy to calculate that there are 1344 possible combinations ( not counting those algorithms that operate on two or three containers at a time ) .
Of course not all combinations of algorithms and containers make sense .
For instance , you can't apply std:: sort to a std:: list .
The reason is simple : sort ( which is based on quicksort ) requires random access to the container ; a list can only provide sequential access .
And this is the crux of the matter : this important restriction on access cannot be expressed in C ++.
Granted , the code will not compile because at some point sort will try to perform some operation that the list iterator does n't support .
You 'll get a page - long error message .
By my last count a leading C++ compiler emits 73 cryptic lines , many of them stretching to 350 characters , and nary a mention of random access being required by sort .
Template error messages would be even worse if not for a system of hacks ( I mean , template tricks ) and concept - like conventions in the STL .
For instance , a dummy field iterator_tag corresponds to a concept name and iterator traits look a lot like concept maps .
With a number of new features in C++0 x ( especially decltype that make SFINAE constructs such as the enable_if more powerful ) , even more " tricks " became possible .
If some of this sounds like Gibberish to you , you 're in good company .
That 's the mess that the concept proposal was trying to fix .
Concepts do introduce a lot of complexity into the language but they reduce and organize the complexity of programs .
It 's worth mentioning that Alex Stepanov collaborated in the development of the concept description language , Tecton , and participated in the C++ concept effort , so he 's been acutely aware of the problems with STL .
Competing Options
The idea of limiting types that can be passed to generic algorithms or data structures has been around for some time .
The C++ concept proposal is based on the Haskell 's notion of type classes .
Several other languages opted for simpler constrained templates instead .
Constrained Templates
One way to look at concepts is that they constrain the kind of types that may be passed to a template function or data type .
One can drop concepts and instead impose type constraints directly in the definition of a template .
For instance , rather than defining the Iterator concept , we could have tried to impose analogous type constraints in the definition of Count ( C++ does n't have special syntax for it but , of course , there are template tricks for everything ) .
There are various ways of expressing type constraints , so let 's look at a few examples .
In Java , everything is an object , and objects are classified by classes and interfaces .
Java reuses the same class / interface mechanism for constraining template parameters .
A generic SortedList , for instance , is parametrized by the type of its elements , T .
The constraint imposed on type T is that it implements the interface Comparable .
class SortedList < T extends Comparable <T >>
This approach breaks down for built - in types since , for instance , int cannot be derived from Comparable .
( Java 's workaround is to use boxed types , like Integer , which are magically derived from Comparable . )
C# has similar approach , with some restrictions and some extensions .
For instance , C# lets you specify that a given type is default constructible , as in this example :
class WidgetFactory <T> where T : Widget , new ( )
Here type T must be derived from Widget and it must have a default constructor .
In the D programming language , template constraints may be expressed by arbitrary compile - time functions as well as use - patterns , which are the topic of the next section .
These approaches are constrained to structural ( as opposed to semantic ) matching of types .
A type is accepted by a constrained template if the operations supported by it match those specified by the constraints name - by - name .
If one library names the same operations differently , they wo n't match ( see how Concept Maps deal with this problem ) .
Use Patterns vs. Signatures
Use patterns formed the basis on the original Texas proposal for C++ Concepts .
The idea was to show to the compiler representative examples of what you were planning to do with type arguments .
These use patterns look almost like straightforward C++.
For instance , an Iterator concept might be defined as follows :
concept Iterator < typename Iter , typename Value > { Var < Iter > i;
Iter j = i ; // copyable bool b = ( i != j ) ; // ( non ) -equality comparable ++i ; // supports operator ++ Var<const Value > v ; * i = v ; // connects
Value type with Iter type ... }
Notice the subtlety with defining dummy variables i and v .
You can't just write :
Iter i ;
The Type Equality Problem
It 's hard to express strict equality of types with use patterns .
You might think that the following pattern would work : void f( T t , U u ) ; Var <T > x ; Var <U > y ; f(y , x ) ;
In reality it only insures that the types are mutually implicit - convertible .
In particular , it will match short with long ( yes , you can implicitly convert a long to a short in C++ ) .
Who cares ? , you might ask .
Unfortunately strict type equality might be required for template type inference .
The following code will not compile because the compiler will look for f( short , long ) , even though the instantiation of f( long , long ) would work with implicit type conversions .
template < class T> void f( T x , T y ) ; short i ; long j ; f( i , j ) ;
In the concept language , there is a special concept , SameType , for this purpose .
because that would imply that Iter has a default constructor -- which is not required .
Hence special notation Var <T > for introducing dummy variables .
In general , the use - pattern language was supposed to be a subset of C++ with some additional syntax on the side .
To my knowledge this subset has never been formally defined .
Also , there are some useful concepts that are hard or impossible to define in use - pattern language ( see the sidebox ) .
Then there is the problem of concept - checking the body of a template before it is instantiated -- the holy grail of conceptology .
It involves some nontrivial analysis and comparison of two parsing trees ( the pattern's , and the template body 's ) .
As far as I know no formal algorithm has been presented .
Because of the difficulties in formalizing the use - pattern approach , the C++ committee decided to focus on defining concepts using signatures .
We 've seen such a signature in the Iterator concept : T&operator ++( T& ) .
How are we to interpret a signature within the context of a concept ?
Naively , we 'd require that there should exist a free function called operator ++ .
But what if the type T has a method operator ++ instead ?
Do we have to list it too ( as T ::operator + + ( ) ) ?
A uniform call syntax was proposed that would unify functions and method calls .
Our operator ++ would match a function or a method ( this feature did n't make it into the final concept proposal . )
Also , an operator signature must also match the built - in operator -- this way we 'd allow an arbitrary pointer to match the Iterator concept .
These are some of the complications I mentioned at the beginning of this post .
There are also complications related to symbol lookup ( it has to take into account the Argument - Dependent - Lookup hack ) and overload resolution , which are notoriously difficult in C ++.
Who Ordered Concept Maps ?
So far we 've talked about concepts and about templates that use concepts .
Now let 's focus on what happens when we instantiate a template with concrete types .
How does the compiler check that those types fulfill the constraints of the concepts ?
One possibility is the " duck - typing " approach -- if the type in question defines the same associated types and functions ( and possibly some other constraints I have n't talked about ) , it is a match .
This is called structural ( same set of functions ) and nominal ( by - name ) matching .
Structural matching is simple and straightforward but it might lead to " false positives . "
Here 's the archetypal example : Syntactically , there is no difference between a ForwardIterator and an InputIterator , yet semantically those two are not equivalent .
Some algorithms that work fine on ForwardIterator s will fail on InputIterator s ( the difference is that you can't go twice through an InputIterator ) .
Semantic matching , on the other hand , requires the client to explicitly match types with concepts ( only the clients knows the meaning of a particular concept ) .
This is done through concept maps ( in Haskell they are called " instances " ) .
With this approach , the mapping between Iterator and a pointer to T would require the following statement :
template < T> concept_map Iterator <T *> { typedef T value_type ; } ;
Notice that we do n't have to provide the mapping for operator ++ ; it 's automatically mapped into the built - in ++ .
In general , if the associated functions have the same names as the functions defined for the particular type ( like ++ in this case ) , the concept map may be empty .
It 's mostly because of the need to create those empty concept maps that the concept proposal was rejected .
Interestingly , both groups that worked on concepts -- the Texas group with Bjarne Stroustrup and the Indiana group with Doug Gregor -- supported concept maps .
The difference was that the Texas group wanted concepts to be matched automatically , unless marked as explicit ; whereas the Indiana group required explicit concept maps , unless the concept was marked auto .
On a more general level , concept maps enable cross-matching between different libraries and naming conventions .
Semantically , a concept from one library may match a type from another library , but the corresponding functions and types may have different names .
For instance , a StackOfInt concept from one library may declare an associated function called push .
A vector from the Standard Library , conceptually , implements this interface , but uses a different name for it .
A concept map would provide the appropriate mapping :
concept_map StackOfInt< std::vector<int >> { void push ( std : : vector < int > & v , int x ) { v. push_back ( x ) ; } }
Conclusion
In my opinion , concepts would add a lot to C ++.
They would replace conventions and hacks in the STL with a coherent set of language rules .
They would provide verifiable documentation and drastically simplify template error messages .
Concept maps have an important role to play as the glue between concepts and types .
With concept maps you 'll be able to add , post hoc , a translation layer between disparate libraries .
The back - and - forth between explicit and auto concepts has a philosophical aspect :
Do we prefer precision or recall in concept matching ?
It also has a practical aspect :
Is writing empty concept maps an abomination ?
More experience is needed to resolve this issue .
The major complaint I 've heard about the concept proposal was that it was too complex .
Indeed , it took 30 pages to explain it in the Draft Standard .
However , adding a new layer of abstraction to an existing language , especially one with such baggage as C++ , can not be trivial .
The spec had to take into account all possible interaction with other language features , such as name resolution , overload resolution , ADL , various syntactic idiosyncrasies , and so on .
But programmers rarely read language specs .
I 'm sure that , if there was a book " Effective Concepts " or some such , programmers would quickly absorb the rules and start using concepts .
The current hope is that concepts will become part of the 1x version of C++.
Doug Gregor is working on a new version of the C++ compiler , which is likely to become testing grounds for concepts .
He also publishes a blog with Dave Abrahams ( see for instance this post and the follow up ) .
On the other hand , the concept effort has definitely lost its momentum after it was voted out of C++0 x .
Corporate support for further research is dwindling .
The hope is in the educated programmers saying no to hacks and demanding the introduction of concepts in future versions of the C++ Standard .

I hope you never have to use what I ’m about to discuss here : Insurance .
Insurance is one of those financial products that you should have , but hope that you never actually use .
Unfortunately , accidents do happen and those who have an insurance policy will be happy they planned ahead .
I never really enjoy listening to an insurance salesman at the employee benefits because they always seem to use fear to sell their product .
But the fact is that insurance is all about the unknown and unimaginable happening , which is why you and your family should carefully consider these five insurance policies .
1. Umbrella Insurance
Simply put , an umbrella policy covers the remaining expenses left by your current insurance .
For example , imagine that you were in an automobile accident and there was a judgment against you for $ 350,000 , but your auto policy only covered up to $ 200,000 .
The remaining $ 150,000 balance would probably force you to sell all your assets and might mean that you need to declare bankruptcy .
With an umbrella policy , the difference would be covered up to whatever amount your policy is declared for .
Typically , 1 - 2 million dollar policies are standard , but higher umbrella policies are available if needed .
One of the most common misconceptions about umbrella insurance is that it ’s too expensive to afford .
When you start throwing words like 1 million dollar insurance policy , most people say that ’s way out of their budget .
But the fact is that many people can add an umbrella policy for $ 15 – $ 25 a month .
The actual amount will depend on the insurance company you insure through as well as your credit score and other personal risk factors .
2. Term Life Insurance
If a tragic accident happened tomorrow to you , would your surviving family have the resources to cover the bills ?
Whenever the thought crosses my mind or when I hear of someone who dies unexpectedly , I ’m always thankful that my wife and I have term life insurance policies .
If you have a family and are the sole breadwinner , you definitely need to have a term life policy – no question in my opinion .
The factors determining the cost of your policy will depend on your age , health , and other medical conditions , so it ’s better to start a policy now rather than waiting a year or two .
Policies can vary greatly , but there ’s no reason why you should n’t be able to find good quotes on term life insurance .
3. Renter ’s Insurance
I ca n’t stress this enough , especially to the younger readers who might be fresh out of college .
Get renter ’s insurance – it ’s just smart .
If something happens to the apartment complex you ’re living in and all your possessions are damaged , stolen , or completely destroyed , do n’t go running to the landlord demanding full replacement .
Your chances are slim to none .
Most incidents are a matter of renter ’s insurance , and if you do n’t have coverage , you might be out thousands of dollars if an accident happens .
Most young renters do n’t realize the importance of renter ’s insurance and those who are told about it might feel too strapped for cash to start a policy .
The truth is that a basic policy for an apartment or small rental can run as little as $ 100 to $ 200 on average for the year .
It ’s a small price to pay to insure against accidents caused by you or by your neighbors .
4. Disability Insurance
If you ’re employed , there ’s a good chance that you have a disability insurance plan already .
There are a lot of options for disability insurance , including employer group plans , supplemental plans , and short and long - term disability plans .
If your employer does provide some short or long term disability benefits , it ’s probably not going to cover 100 % of your income .
If you have a supplemental policy , you ’ll be paid for any time that you need to take off because of an injury or other ailment .
It ’s worth considering as open enrollment season is happening at many employers this month .
5. Flood and Earthquake Insurance
Flooding is one of the most common causes of property loss in the United States .
If you live in an area that is subject to floods , you should have a visit with a local insurance agent or call the National Flood Insurance Program for more information on flood insurance policies provided in your area .
Earthquake insurance is n’t something that I ’m concerned with because I live in the Midwest where earthquakes rarely happen .
But for those who live on the west coast , you might look into getting an earthquake policy .
Unfortunately , these policies can get quite expensive if you live on the west coast , but earthquakes can be devastating .
The 1994 Northridge earthquake near Los Angeles generated more than 195,000 claims averaging $ 35,000 .
If I lived on the coast , I would definitely shop around for earthquake insurance .
Do you have these insurance policies in place already ?
What other policies would you add to this list ?

NFL postpones Pittsburgh - Tennessee game after 9 in Titans organization test positive for COVID - 19
The Pittsburgh - Tennessee game originally scheduled for Sunday will be played either Monday or Tuesday due to positive coronavirus tests among the Titans , the NFL announced Wednesday .
Image caption The World Cup kicks off next month
FIFA has scored an " own goal " by agreeing sponsorship deals for the 2010 World Cup with companies that sell unhealthy products , campaigners say .
The World Cancer Research Fund criticised the governing body for partnering with the likes of Coca Cola , McDonald 's and Budweiser .
It said the tournament should be an opportunity to promote active lifestyles .
Advertisers denied the deals would negatively impact children 's diets .
The three companies are partners or official sponsors for the World Cup giving them a visible presence inside the stadiums on advertising hoardings and digital displays .
And the charity believes that with matches being watched by billions of people in more than 200 countries people across the world will be influenced .
It is disappointing that these companies have been chosen as sponsors and partners Teresa Nightingale , World Cancer Research Fund
Teresa Nightingale , the charity 's general manager , said : " There is no doubt that when it comes to the fight against childhood obesity , football can be a force for good because it is a type of physical activity that is accessible to almost everyone .
" I am sure many children will be inspired by the skills of the likes of Rooney and Messi and try to repeat them in their back gardens and local parks in the same way as their parents and grandparents once tried to emulate Maradona and Pelé . "
But she added : " It is disappointing that these companies have been chosen as sponsors and partners .
" The FIFA website describes sponsorship as an opportunity to promote brands on a global basis and we would argue that it is a real own goal to be giving this opportunity to companies that are known for unhealthy products . "
Lead by example
She said it was important to be realistic and accept that the existing sponsorship agreements were now in place .
But she said it would be a great boost for public health around the world if FIFA could show real leadership on this issue by announcing that it would not consider companies that promote unhealthy products as sponsors or partners in future .
She said that the charity was raising its concerns to make parents aware of the effect of this type of marketing and urged them to stock up on healthy foods , such as fruit and vegetables .
Ian Barber , director of communications at the Advertising Association , said : " When the Government 's research suggests that , at most , advertising has a marginal impact on a child 's overall diet , these comments risk everyone taking their eye off the ball .
" Without sponsorship , we would have fewer events like the World Cup to inspire young people , not to mention the scores of advertising - funded programmes which aim to keep kids active and healthy .
" If we are serious about improving child health , we need to find more ways to help kids choose the right lifestyle and less time on well - meaning but often poorly evidenced and mis-directed rhetoric . "
FIFA said it ran projects using the popularity of football to highlight and tackle urgent global health issues .

Objective -C FAQ 日本語訳 - 回答集
GCC Manual " 3.6 Options Controlling Objective - C and Objective - C++ Dialects "
Objective - Cは1980年代の始めごろ 、Brad Cox博士が考案しました。 Objective - Cは、人気のあるC言語の上に作られた、オブジェクト指向を
実現する層として開発されました(このFAQとその他のObjective - Cに関する多くの 文書では、C言語またはそれに近い言語の知識があることを前提とします ) 。
Cox博士が実装したオリジナル のObjective-Cは、Cコードを生成するプリプロセッサ として実現され、Stepstoneの製品として販売されました。
Objective-Cは、C言語の純粋なスーパーセットです。そのため、コンパイラが サポートするC言語のバージョンによって、Objective-Cは変化することがあります。
C言語に追加された機能はわずかで、ほんの少しの新しいキーワード、3つの型( そのうち の id だけが最もよく使われる ) 、そしてメッセージ送信の構文が 追加されました 。
Objective - Cには、C、C++、その他の言語にあるような標準規格の文書はありません。 したがって、Objective-Cの公式な定義はその実装によって示されます。
最も普及していて、活発に開発されているObjective-Cは、Appleがメインテナンス している、GNU Cコンパイラをベースにしたものです。
Free Software Foundationによる通常のGNU
Cコンパイラ もObjective - Cをサポート しており、その実装 はAppleのものととてもよく似ていますが、新機能の追加に
少々時間がかかります。また、両者のランタイムには互換性がありません。
David StesによるPOCというObjective-Cの実装もありますが、前述のふたつとは 互換性がなく、AppleのObjective-Cが提供している機能の多くを含みません。 しかしその一方で、POCはブロック( Smalltalkの機能。Rubyにもみられる ) と
クラス変数をサポートしています。POCは、他の普及しているObjective-Cと互換性が ないため、このFAQではこれ以上取り上げません。
Appleは 、Mac OS Xバージョ ン 10.5 ( " Leopard " ) において 、Objective - Cに いくつかの追加の機能を導入しています。これらの機能は" Objective - C 2.0 " と して登場する予定です。ここではこれをObjC 2と呼ぶことにします。ObjC 2に ついては 、Appleが公式にアナウンスするときに明らかになるでしょう。 後述するObjC 2のセクションを参照してください。また、ObjC 2に関する議論の中で、 さらなる検討を必要とするところでは、このフォントスタイルを
使って記述します。今のところ、ObjC 2の機能は、OS X 10.5 のデベロッパ プレビューに含まれ るApple版のランタイムでのみ利用できます。新しい機能を使用する
かどうかは自由に選択でき、既存のObjective-Cとの互換性は失われません。
Objective - Cのソースコードは、一般的に、CやC++のソースコードと同じように
構成します。宣言とオブジェクトのインタフェイスは、拡張子.hを付けたヘッダ
ファイルに記述し、定義とオブジェクトの実装は、拡張子.m( メソッド[method ]の略 ) を
付けたファイルに記述します。
ほとんどのプラットフォームで利用できるgccを
Objective-Cコンパイラとして利用できます(gccには2種類ありますが、それについては
後述します)。歴史的には、NeXTコンピュータ(後のNeXTソフトウェア) とStepstoneが Objective-Cコンパイラを製作しました。しかし、どちらの会社もすでにありません。
NeXT がStepstoneからObjective-Cに関する権利を取得し、その後、AppleがNeXTの
権利を取得したことにより、現在では、Appleコンピュータが所有権を持っています。
Metrowerksの製品であるCodeWarriorという開発環境がObjective-Cコンパイラを 備えていましたが、こちらも今では存在しません。
Objective -Cのソースファイルは、普通のテキストエディタを使用して編集できます。 また、EmacsのようなObjective-Cの構文をハイライトするモードがあるエディタが あります。Objective-Cをサポートする統合開発環境には、Appleの
Xcodeや GNUstepの ProjectCenter といったものがあります。
Objective - Cコンパイラがあれば、すぐにプログラミングを始めることはできますが、
それだけでは、自分が関心を持っている対象のプログラミングをする前に、多くの
車輪の再発明をしなければならないでしょう。クラスライブラリは、事前に作成された
オブジェクトとクラスのセットを提供します。クラスライブラリは通常、コンテナ、
データ処理、ユーザインタフェイスといった機能を提供します。
Objective - Cで利用できるクラスライブラリの多くは、NeXTコンピュータと
Sunマイクロシステムズが開発したOpenStepに由来します。これらには、Apple Mac OS XのCocoa、 クロスプラットフォームのGNUstepといった ものがあります。どちらのクラスライブラリも、それぞれに特有なクラスの他に、
ファンデーション(コンテナ、文字列、ネットワーク/IPCなど)
、AppKit( ユーザ インタフェイスコンポーネント ) を提供します。 OpenDarwinのlibFoundation は ファンデーション部分のみ実装しています。
Swarmという エージェントベースモデリングのため のObjective - Cフレームワークがあります。
#import は 、C言語の #include とよく似た動作をする プリプロセッサ指令です。 #include と異なり、 #import は 同じファイ ル
を2度インクルードしません。これにより、ヘッダファイルの中で #ifdef を用い て2重インクルードを防止する必要はなくなります。 gccのバージョンによっては、 #import を使うと警告を出すものが あります。その場合には 、
- Wno - import オプションを指定すること で警告を出力させないようにすることができます。
C言語と同じスタイルのコメントを使用できます。ひとつは、 // で 始まるコメントで、行末までがコメントになります。
// BCPLスタイルのコメント
もうひとつは、 /* で始め、 */ で終わるコメントです。
/* Cスタイルのコメント * 複数行にわたってコメントできる * この形式のコメントはネストできないことに注意！
*/
Objective - Cのキーワード id は、任意のオブジェクトへの参照に 相当する型です。特定のクラスのポインタを使えば、より厳格な型チェックを行わせる こともできます。例えば、 MyClass * には、 MyClass クラス、 または、そのサブクラスのオブジェクトへの参照を格納することができますが、その他 のクラスのオブジェクトへの参照を格納しようとするとエラーになります。
self は、メソッドの実装の中で利用できる特別な変数で、現在の オブジェクト( すなわち、メソッドを起動したメッセージを受信したオブジェクト)への 参照を格納しています。 super は、スーパークラスに実装されているメソッドを起動するために 使用します。self とsuperは一般的にオブジェクトの初期化で使用されます。
-( id ) init { if ( ( self= [ super init ] ) ) { // スーパークラスの-initを起動する someIvar= [ [ MyClass alloc ] init ] ; } return self ; // オブジェクト自身を返す }
次のように、オブジェクトに対して - class メッセージを送信すると、 オブジェクトのクラスを表すオブジェクトを返します。
MyClass * someObject= [ [ MyClass alloc ] init ] ; id a Class=[ someObject class ] ;
クラスオブジェクトはルートクラスのインスタンスのように振る舞います( すなわち、
[ aClass class ] はルートクラスを返します ) 。
aClass が 参照しているオブジェクトは、クラスオブジェクト
MyClass であり、 MyClass にメッセージを送信したときと同じようにクラスメッセージに 応答します。例えば 、 [ [ aClass alloc ] init ] は MyClass の 新しいインスタンスを生成します 。
nil はnullオブジェクトを表し、オブジェクトが未初期化である
ことや、クリアされた状態であることを表わすのに使用されます(また、Nilはnullクラス オブジェクトを表します)。他の言語と異なり、Objective-Cでは、nilにメッセージを
送信することが許されています。そのときの返却値は、返却値の型がid型のメッセージ の場合はnilを返し、intのような単純なC言語の型の場合は0を返します。structの
ような複合型の場合の返却値は未定義です。nilとNilはともに ( id ) 0 と 定義されています 。
@defs キーワードは、与えられたクラスのオブジェクトのメモリ上に
おけるレイアウトと同じC言語の宣言のリストを用意します。これは、Objective-Cの
オブジェクトを操作するCのAPIを作成するのに使用できます。次のように使用します。
struct MyClass_t { @defs ( MyClass ) } ;
ライブラリの中での使用であれば問題ないのですが、一般的に @defs の 使用はカプセル化に違反することになるので、好まれないことに注意してください。
手短に言うと、それはできません。( -( id ) doSomething :( id ) sender の ように )メッセージのパラメータにコンテキスト情報を含めればできるかもしれ
ませんが、メッセージ送信者が正確なコンテキスト情報を渡す必要があります。
その必要はありません。普通は、変更したクラスとそのサブクラスを再コンパイル しなければなりません。 @defs ( ) を使用してい るCのソース( あるいは インスタンス変数に直接アクセスしているソース ) は、そのクラスのメモリ上の レイアウトが変わるので、再コンパイルする必要があります。インスタンス変数に アクセサメソッド、または 、KVC / KVO ( 「キー値コーディング、キー値監視とはなん
ですか」を参照)を介してアクセスしているコードは、再コンパイルする必要は ありません。
カテゴリは、既存のクラスにメソッドを追加する方法です。
カテゴリは、既存の @interface と @implementation 宣言と は別の宣言として記述され、そこには、カテゴリが実行時にロードされるときに クラスに追加されるメソッドが含まれます。カテゴリは、gcc版
のObjective -Cを 実装しているコンパイラでのみ利用できます。
カテゴリのインタフェイス宣言は次のように記述します。
@interface ClassName ( CategoryName ) - method ; @end
カテゴリ名は実行時に何の影響も及ぼしませんが、同じクラスの他のカテゴリとは
異なる、一意な名前を付けなければなりません。また、カテゴリ名はスタックトレースに現れます。
カテゴリの実装は次のように記述します。
@implementation ClassName ( CategoryName ) - method {...} @end
カテゴリを使用すると、ひとつのクラスの実装を複数のファイルに分割することが
できます。クラスの実装をカテゴリに分割し、それらを別々のファイルに記述します。
また、カテゴリを使用すると、ソースコードを直接修正できないクラスにメソッドを
追加することもできます。たとえば、あなたが使用しているクラスライブラリに
含まれるあるデータコンテナに、 -md5Sum メソッドを追加するといった ようなことができます。
簡単に言ってしまえば、プロトコルは実装を持たないインタフェイスです。
プロトコルは便宜上ひとつにまとめられたメッセージの集合です。プロトコルを使用
すると、あるクラスがプロトコルのすべてのメッセージを実装していると宣言する
ことや、あるオブジェクトがそのプロトコルに適合しているかどうかを確認すること
ができます。また、プロトコルを変数の型宣言に使用して、その変数が参照する
オブジェクトが特定のメソッドの集合を持つが、そのオブジェクトの実際のクラスに
ついては関心がないということを示すことができます。
プロトコルは次のように宣言します。
@protocol ProtocolName - method ; @end
プロトコルは他のプロトコルから継承できます。プロトコルの継承は、クラスの
継承の場合と同じように、親プロトコルのメソッドが子プロトコルに追加されます。
プロトコルを継承する場合、宣言の1行目は次のようになります。
@protocol ProtocolName < ParentProtocol >
クラスのインタフェイス宣言を次のように記述します。
@interface ClassName < ProtocolName >
複数のプロトコルに適合させる場合、プロトコル名をカンマで区切って記述します。
デフォルトでは、次のようなクラスの場合、
@interface MyClass : NSObject < AProtocol >
gccは、 AProtocol プロトコルから継承したメソッドが実装されている か調べるために、 MyClass のインタフェイスだけ調べます。そのため、 そのメソッドがスーパークラスで実装されていても、
MyClass にメソッド がみつからない場合は警告します。gccに
- Wno - protocol オプションを 指定すると、gccはプロトコルメソッドをクラス階層の中から探すようになります。
Objectクラスの場合、次のように記述します。
[ obj conformsTo:@protocol ( ProtocolName ) ]
NSObjectクラスの場合、次のように記述します。
[ obj conformsToProtocol:@protocol ( ProtocolName ) ]
プロトコルに適合する変数で、クラスに制限がないものを宣言するには、次のように 記述します。
id < ProtocolName > obj ;
特定のクラス( またはそのサブクラス ) で、プロトコルに適合する変数を宣言する には、次のようにします 。
ClassName < ProtocolName > * obj ;
この形式を使用することはほとんどありません。
非形式プロトコルは実のところプロトコルではなく、メソッドの実装を持たない
カテゴリのインタフェイス宣言です。非形式プロトコルはCocoaの中でよく使用され、
形式プロトコルの使用が適当でない状況で、コンパイラに対してメソッドの集合を
宣言するために使用されます。たとえば、実装する必要のないメソッドが多くある というような状況です。
SEL は、メソッドセレクタを表わ すCのデータ型です( すなわち 、SEL型の データは個々のメッセージを一意に識別します ) 。メソッドセレクタは、 @selector ( ) キーワードを使用して取得できます。
SEL aSelector=@selector(doSomethingWithStuff : ) ;
また、ランタイム関数を使用して取得することもできます。
Apple gccでは sel_getUid( ) を使用し、 GNU gccでは sel_get_any_uid ( ) を使用します 。
perform : と performSelector : は、指定されたセレクタに 対応するメッセージをオブジェクトに送信します。すなわち、 [ obj performSelector:@selector( message ) ] と記述するのは、 [ obj message ] と記述するのと同じことです。 両者の違いは、 perform : と performSelector : は、セレクタを 参照する変数を引数として渡すことができるのに対し、普通に [ obj message ] と 記述した場合には、常に同じメッセージを送信します。
IMP は、メソッドの実装を表わ すCのデータ型で、実装ポインタとも 呼ばれています。 IMP は、返却値がid型で、 self と メソッドセレクタ( メソッド定義の中で変数_cmdとして参照可能)を引数の最初に とる関数へのポインタです。
id ( * IMP ) ( id , SEL , ... ) ;
NSObjectの場合、次のようにして、指定されたメソッドの
IMP を 取得できます 。
IMP imp=[obj methodForSelector:@selector( message ) ] ;
Objectの場合は、次のようにします。
IMP imp=[ obj methodFor:@selector( message ) ] ;
Cの関数ポインタのように、間接参 照( Dereference ) します。
id anObject , the Result ; IMP someImp ; SEL aSelector ; // ... the Result=someImp( anObject , aSelector ) ;
IMP はid型の値を返すメソッドへのポインタです。 IMP を id型以外の値を返す SEL とともに使用すると問題を起すことがあるので、 IMP の代わりに新しい型を用意して、その型にキャストしたほうがよい でしょう 。
int ( * foo ) ( id , SEL ) ; int result ; foo= ( int ( * ) ( id , SEL ) ) [ anArray methodForSelector:@selector( count ) ] ; result=foo( anArray , @selector ( count ) ) ;
Objective - Cのランタイム関数を使用して IMP を取得するには、 GNUのランタイムの場合、 objc_msg_lookup( id, SEL ) を使用しま す( これを 説明してくれ た Justin Hibbitsに感謝します ) 。NeXT / Appleのランタイムの場合は、 class_getInstanceMethod( Class , SEL ) を使用することができるでしょう。 この関数で struct objc_method へのポインタを取得し、 その構造体の method_imp メンバが、あなたが必要とする IMP です 。
ランタイムのメッセージ送信関数を直接使用するか、前の質問の中で論じたのと
同じように、メソッドの IMP を取得し、それをキャストすることで可能です。
Apple/ NeXTランタイムにおけるメッセージ送信関数は objc_msgSend(id, SEL , ... ) です。 ただし、メソッドの返却値の型によって異なる関数が提供されており、それらを使い分ける必要が あることに注意してください。 詳細は 、
/usr / include /objc/objc-runtime.h 、または 、Objective - C Runtime Reference を 参照してください。簡単な例を以下に示します。
typedef int ( * IntReturn ) ( id , SEL ) ; NSArray * ary = [ NSArray alloc ] ; SEL initSel=@selector( initWithObjects :) ,countSel=@selector( count ) ; // id型の値が返される ary=objc_msgSend(ary , initSel , @" Hello " , @" World " , nil ) ; // int型の値が返される c=(( IntReturn ) objc_msgSend ) ( ary , countSel ) ; NSLog ( @ " %@ : %d " , ary , c ) ;
GNUランタイムでは、 objc_msg_sendv(id , SEL,arglist_t ) を使用できる でしょう。この関数は、任意のメッセージの送信に使用できますが、コーリングフレームを 作らなければならないので、 objc_msgSend ( ) よりも多くのセットアップを 必要とします。以下の例は、GNUstep DOコードをベースにしています。
例によって、メモリ管理は省略しています(コーリングフレームを解放する必要があります ) 。
NSArray * ary = [ [ NSArray alloc ] initWithObjects : @" Hello " , @" World " , nil ] ; int * cp ; SEL countSel=@selector ( count ) ; Method_t meth=class_get_instance_method( [ ary class ] , countSel ) ; arglist_t frame=objc_calloc ( 8,1 ) ; const char * rettype=objc_skip_type_qualifiers(meth->method_types ) ; int stackargs=atoi( objc_skip_typespec( rettype ) ) ; frame->arg_ptr=stackargs?objc_calloc(stackargs,1):0 ; cp=(int *)objc_msg_sendv(ary , countSel , frame ) ; NSLog ( @ " %@ : %d " , ary , * cp ) ;
返却値が普通の 型( 構造化されていない、 sizeof ( t ) <= sizeof ( id ) と なるような 型 t) の場合は、前の質問で述べたように、
IMP を取得し、適切な 返却値を持つ型にキャストするのが簡単です。
例外はプログラムの実行中に起こるイベントで、通常のプログラムの流れを 中断します。Javaのような他のオブジェクト指向言語を使用していたプログラマ
なら、例外についてよく知っているでしょう。Objective-Cによるプログラミング
ではよく、(アサーションのテストのような)単にプログラマのエラーを見つける
ために使用されたり、通常のプログラムの流れの中でユーザにエラーを知らせる ために使用されます。
例外は、今のところ、NeXT gcc(「 GNU gcc、Apple / NeXT gccと呼ぶのはなぜ ですか」を参照)ランタイムでのみ利用することができます。例外を使用するには、 gccの - fobjc-exceptions オプションを有効にしなければなりません。
例外をスローする可能性のあるコードは、 @try ブロックの中に記述 します。 @try の後にひとつ以上の @catch ブロックを置き、 その中でスローされた例外を処理します。 @catch に続く @finally ブロックには、例外が発生するしないにかかわらず実行すべきコードを記述します。 例外で使用するオブジェクトはどのようなオブジェクトでもよく、 @throw キーワード を使ってスローします。以下に例を示します 。
@try { // 例外がスローされる可能性のあるコード ... } @catch( MyExceptionClass * ex ) { // カスタム例外を処理する ... } @catch ( id * ex ) { // 一般的な例外のハンドラ ... } @finally { // ここは例外が発生してもしなくても実行される
... }
上記のコードには、ふたつの @catch ブロックがあります。ひとつは 具体的な型の例外をキャッチし、もうひとつは一般的な型の例外をキャッチします。 最も具体的な型の例外ハンドラを先に記述する必要があります。 例外は、 goto や return によって発生するコールスタックの 変化に脆弱であるので注意してください 。
できます。キャッチした例外を再スローするには、 @catch ブロックの 中で、引数なしで @throw ( ) と記述します 。
gccにObjective-Cの例外の構文が導入される前には、Cocoaは独自の例外処理メカニズム を提供していました。それは、Cの標準関数である longjmp ( ) と setjmp ( )
を使用したマクロをベースにしていました。Objective-C言語に導入された例外処理
( @try など ) の実装は、今のところ、 NS_DURING などを 使用する例外処理とバイナリ上の互換性があります。
@synchronized は、マルチスレッドプログラミングのための単純な
ロックをサポートするコンパイラ指令です。 @synchronized は、NeXT の ランタイム上で、gccの - fobjc - exceptions フラグ( 前述の 「 例外処理 」 を 参照 ) を指定することによって利用できます。 @synchronized は、明示的に ロックを生成、管理することなく、どのようなオブジェクトでも暗黙のうちにロック
することができます。あなたがJavaをよく知っているなら、 @synchronized は Javaのsynchronizedと基本的に同じものであると考えてください。
構文は次のようになります。
@synchronized ( object ) { ... }
このコード は" object " をロックします。他のスレッドが同じオブジェクトに 対する @synchronized ブロックを実行しようとするとき、実行中の スレッドが @synchronized ブロックの実行を終了するまで処理を 進めません。これは次のコードと基本的に同じです。
[ [ object getLock ] lock ] ; ... [ [ object getLock ] unlock ] ;
違いは、オブジェクト自身が上記のようなメソッドを持って、明示的にロック
オブジェクトを管理する必要がないことです。
明示的にロックを生成、削除する必要がないので、コードの読み書きがしやすく なります。また、 @synchronized はreturn文と例外を認識するので、 ブロックの途中で処理を中断しても、ロックは必ず解放されます。
@synchronized は、暗黙のロックを検索するオーバーヘッドが大きい
ので、明示的なロックに比べて処理が遅いです。また、
@synchronized は 常に再帰的なロックを使用します。再帰的なロックはそうでないロックに比べて処理が
遅いです。さらに、条件変数やその他の高度なスレッドの概念をサポートしていない
ので、柔軟性がありません。
Apple( 以前は NeXT ) が使用しているgccのバージョンは、Free Software Foundation が 配布しているgccとは異なるObjective-Cの実装(特にランタイムが異なる)を提供します。
DarwinとMac OS Xは 、 Apple gccとともに出荷されています。CocoaはApple gccに 依存しています。他のオペレーティングシステムは、一般的に、GNUのObjective-Cを 使用しています。GNUstepは、GNUのObjective-Cを必要とします。 しかし、どちらのコンパイラのソースも利用できるので、どちらでも使用したい方を
あなたが使用しているプラットフォーム用にビルドできます。
Appleは独自のgccを使用しているため、両者で利用可能な機能はいつでも異なる
可能性があります。あなたが使用しているgccのバージョンのドキュメントを調べて、
利用したい機能が実際に存在するか確かめてください。
クラスライブラリを使用していない場合は、次のようにします。
gcc -c myfile .m - lobjc
クラスライブラリを使用している場合は、そのクラスライブラリのドキュメントを
調べてみてください。たとえば、Cocoaを使用する場合は、次のようにします。
gcc - framework Cocoa -c myfile.m
gccは 、Objective-CとC++を混在させることができるObjective-C++と呼ばれるものを
サポートしています。Objective-C++のコードは、拡張子.mmを付けたファイルの中に 記述します。Objective-C++では、Objective-CのオブジェクトをC++のオブジェクトの
インスタンス変数に保持でき、またその逆もできます。しかし、C++のクラスを 継承してObjective-Cのクラスを定義することはできず、その逆もできません。
Objective-CとC++の例外処理メカニズムは完全に異なり、C++の catch を 使用して、 @throw で発生させた例外をキャッチすることはできません。
@ " Hello world ! " のよう なObjective - Cの文字列リテラルを 使用する場合、その文字列オブジェクトのクラスは通常
NXConstantString になります。この文字列クラスは、コンパイル時に gccの -fconstant-string -class オプションを使用して変更することが できます。Cocoaでは、文字列リテラルのクラスは
NSConstantString に なります。もし、文字列定数クラスを別のものに変更したいなら、そのクラスには どのようなメソッドを実装してもよいですが、インスタンス変数のレイアウトは、 メモリ上のレイアウトをコンパイラが実行ファイルに書き込むので、
N[ SX ] ConstantString と同じにしなければなりません ( objc/NXConstStr.h 、または、 Foundation / NSString.h を参照 ) 。
Objective - C 2.0 の機能 新しい for 構文とはどのようなものですか NSArray * bar= ... ; for ( id foo in bar ) { [ foo doSomething ] ; } 上記のコードは、 bar の中のすべてのオブジェクトに - doSomething メッセージを送信します。この点において、新しい for 構文は、よく 知られたオブジェクトの列挙と発想は同じです。
NSArray * bar= ... ; NSEnumerator * e= [ bar objectEnumerator ] ; id foo ; while ( foo=[e nextObject ] ) { [ foo doSomething ] ; } 実際には両者の実装は異なりますが、特に大きなコレクションに対しては、新しい 構文の方がより早く処理できます。また、列挙中にコレクションが変更されることも 防ぎます 。
#import < Foundation / NSObject.h >
完全を期して言えば、NSProxyもルートクラスです。
オブジェクトが応答できないメッセージを受信した場合、ランタイムはエラーを
発生させる前に、そのオブジェクトに対して - forwardInvocation : メッセージを 送信します。これを利用して、あなたのクラスで メソッド -( void ) forwardInvocation :( NSInvocation *) inv を オーバーライドすることにより、認識できないメッセージを他のオブジェクトに
転送することができます。詳細は、developer.apple.comの「転送」の章を参照してください。また、メソッド
-( NSMethodSignature *)methodSignatureForSelector :( SEL ) selector も オーバーライドする必要があります。そうしないと、このメソッドが nil を 返して forwardInvocation : が呼び出されません 。
メッセージ転送の簡単な例として、コレクションを操作するループをオブジェクトの
内部に持たせる方法、すなわち、コレクションの各要素に対してメッセージを送信する
手段をコレクションに持たせる方法を以下に示します。
まずはじめに、トランポリンクラスの
CollectionTrampoline を用意 します。このクラスは、受信したメッセージをコレクションの各要素に転送します。 以下に、このクラスのインタフェイスを示します。
@interface CollectionTrampoline : NSProxy { id the Collection ; } - ( id)initOnCollection :( id ) aCollection ; @end
以下は、オブジェクトの生成と解放メソッドです。
- ( id)initOnCollection :( id ) aCollection { the Collection = [ aCollection retain ] ; return self ; } - ( void ) dealloc { [ theCollection release ] ; [ super dealloc ] ; }
前述したように、メッセージを転送するには、 methodSignatureForSelector : を オーバーライドする必要があります。メソッドシグニチャを生成するAPIはないので、 ここではコレクションの最初のオブジェクトからメソッドシグニシャを探します。 もしみつからなければ、デフォルトのメソッドシグニチャを提供します。 これはあまり問題になりません。なぜなら、まだシグニチャを取得していないなら、 コレクションは空で転送が起らないか、最初のオブジェクトがメソッドを実装して いないので、何か処理する前に例外が発生するからです。この例を提供してくれた
Michael Ashに感謝します。
- ( NSMethodSignature *)methodSignatureForSelector :( SEL ) aSelector { NSMethodSignature * sig = nil ; if ( [ theCollection count ] ) sig = [ [ theCollection objectAtIndex:0 ] methodSignatureForSelector:aSelector ] ; if (!sig ) sig = [ NSObject instanceMethodSignatureForSelector:@selector( release ) ] ; return sig ; }
次は forwardInvocation : の実装です。 NSEnumerator を 使用してコレクションのオブジェクトをイテレートし、各オブジェクトのメソッドを 起動します。この簡単な例では、オブジェクトからの返却値は考慮しません。完全な 例をあげるとすれば、応答のコレクションを生成して、それを戻すことになるでしょう。
- ( void ) forwardInvocation :( NSInvocation *) anInv { id i ; NSEnumerator * en=[theCollection objectEnumerator ] ; while ( i= [ en nextObject ] ) { [ an Inv invokeWithTarget:i ] ; } }
最後に、コレクションクラスがトランポリンオブジェクトを返却する方法を用意
します。これを行う NSArray のカテゴリを以下に示します。
@interface NSArray ( Trampolines ) - ( id ) do ; @end @implementation NSArray ( Trampolines ) - ( id ) do { return [ [ [ Collection Trampoline alloc ] initOnCollection : self ] autorelease ] ; } @end
これで、このトランポリンを使用して、コレクション中のすべてのオブジェクトに

Cocoaは、キー値コーディング( KVC ) とキー値監 視( KVO ) という、オブジェクトの
プロパティの検査と変更を間接的に行う方法を用意しています。 KVCとKVOは主に、Cocoaバインディングの中で、アプリケーションのユーザインタフェイスと
データモデルの間の同期を効率的に行う方法として使用されています。
オブジェクト myObject に - someVariable , - setSomeVariable の ようなアクセサメソッドか、 someVariable , _someVariable と いった id 型のインスタンス変数がある場合、次のようなコード で someVariable の値に( 継承されたプロパティであっても ) アクセスできます 。
[ myObject valueForKeyPath:@" someVariable " ] ; [ myObject setValue : @" Hello " forKeyPath : @" someVariable " ] ;
他のオブジェクト、たとえば myOtherObject は、 someVariable の値が 変更されたとき 、KVO によって通知を受けることができます。
[ myObject addObserver:myOtherObject forKeyPath:@" someVariable " options : NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew context : NULL ] ;
これにより、 someVariable が変更されたとき、 myOtherObject は - observerValueForKeyPath:ofObject :change : context : メッセージを受信します。

A West Yorkshire cannabis grower died of hyperthermia after halogen lamps in his illicit indoor dope plantation heated his house to a fatal 38 °C , the Sun reports .
Luke Holmes , 28 , constructed " three foil - lined tents each containing marijuana plants " , nurtured by a " battery " of halogens .
He died in bed and was discovered by friends three days later in the property in Halifax .
Police officers " almost fainted from the heat when they entered the property on a warm day last June " , the Sun explains .
An inquest in Bradford " heard that Holmes was a drug user , although no drugs were found in his system " .
His death was declared an accident , provoked by fatal overheating . ®
We are told that in the US , the food on our table has traveled an average of 1500 miles and consumed 9 calories of energy for each food calorie on our plate .
In a time when " oil prices are likely to be both higher and more volatile and where oil prices have the potential to destabilize economic , political and social activity " [ 1 ] , we need a way to mitigate the near certain risks of much higher impending food costs .
There are a number of answers , one of which is to support local agriculture .
Additionally , one can grow their own food in a pleasing , sylvan landscape .
5 years ago , I decided I was going to shift from a native plantings landscaping theme to one that turned my yard into a source of sustenance .
I had read about " Edible Landscaping " and " Permaculture " , and decided that approaching tough economic times could be mitigated by growing more of my own food in a manner that did not require a large degree of manual labor .
After all , we are supposed to have 2 - 5 helpings of fruit each day , and nuts have been shown to be very healthy sources of protein and essential fatty acids ( and even lowering cholesterol ) .
My family likes to " pick your own " at local orchards and shop at farmer 's markets , and felt that augmenting those purchases with our own fruits and nuts meant that we would reduce the need to ship food across country .
So in addition to our gardening and backyard chickens , we could effectively cover 3 out of 5 of the basic food groups in the food pyramid right in our yard .
So how does someone go about determining what is appropriate and manageable to grow in their yard ?
The following factors are the most important ;
Location : First , one needs to know what hardiness zone they are in , to eliminate candidate plants that would die from the low temperatures in their area .
For the US , refer to the Hardiness Zone Map update provided by the Arbor Day Foundation ( hit " Play " ) .
Other hardiness maps are available for Canada , Europe , Australia , South America , FSU , China , Japan , and a global map .
Any plant that does not grow well in the zone you are in should be removed from further consideration , unless you are prepared to go to extra measures ( such as create a greenhouse , move the plant indoors seasonally , etc ) .

Disease - resistance : Many popular fruit varieties ( that often show up in local nurseries or hardware stores ) require extensive spraying to control a wide array of diseases , many of which have been imported from other countries and attack local species that have no inherent immunity .
Considerable effort has gone into creating hybrids of species with numerous immunities to produce species that are resistant to a wide variety of disease .
Once you decide on the types of fruit you would like to grow , learn about the diseases that are endemic in your area .
Then select varieties that are resistant to those diseases .

Pollination :
Some species are self - pollinators and do not require a second specimen or variety to produce fruit .
Many species , however , require a second specimen or even another variety to produce fruit .
In this case , you must consider the other varieties that are needed , the timing of the spring bloom ( which must overlap sufficiently ) , and an extra specimen so that the loss of one tree does not eliminate the ability to pollinate .
Note how close pollinators should be to each other ( e.g. , “ no further than 20 feet for some dwarf apple trees ” ) .
Learn how to attract and keep natural pollinating insects ( e.g. , Mason bees , more on this in future articles )

Fruiting schedule :
Be cognizant of the timeframes in which your fruits will ripen ; the best approach is to try to cover as much of the calendar year with as diverse a harvest as possible .
For example , I 've chosen 4 varieties of apples that will provide fruit from July through November , with the later apples able to be stored through the winter ( “ winter - keepers ” ) .
Other choices include strawberries ( May ) and June berries for early fruit and Lingonberries for late fruit ( December ) .
This way , one can enjoy fresh fruits almost year around and dehydrated / canned fruit any time of year .

Pests :
The luscious pictures of fruit on the tree tags at the local nursery often turns into a nightmare of worm - eaten sickly fruit after the first couple of bearing years .
Find out from your local horticulture agent which pests are likely to attack the types of fruits or nuts you ’ve chosen .
Often , some varieties also have some resistance to common pests .
Many pheremone traps and natural pesticide products exist to keep insects from damaging your trees or fruit crop , and there are natural insect predators that can be encouraged ( with their favorite habits ) to take up residence in your yard ( e.g. , Ladybugs , who eat aphids , scale , and mites ) .
Learn about Integrated Pest Management ( IPM ) in order to more efficiently target specific lifecycle vulnerabilities of the pests , either with organic or non-organic controls .

Size : Standard sizes of common fruits such as apples and pears are often too large for homeowners to maintain and harvest effectively .
Dwarf and Semi - dwarf varieties are very popular now with home gardeners , and they also bear fruit much sooner .
The size ( and other attributes such as disease resistance ) depends greatly upon the rootstock used .
Nut trees can generally be large without much issue .

Initial List
After performing the above analyses , I came up with the following candidate plant list based on my location in the Mid Atlantic US ( the list for your specific area may differ ) ;
Fruit Trees :
Apple
Asian Pear
Plum
Pawpaw
Jujube ( Chinese Date )
Persimmon ( American )
Persimmon ( Asian )
Pomegranate
Watermelonball Tree ( Chinese Mulberry )
Berries :
Blueberry
Raspberry
Grapes
Ligonberry
Juneberry
Elderberry
Gooseberry
Goumi
Aroniaberry
Black Huckleberry
Figs
Kiwi
Nuts :
English Walnut
Heartnut ( Japanese Walnut )
Northern Pecan
Filbert
Chestnut
The above list is a fair number of plants , though one 's yard can be artfully planned out to yield a large amount of fruits and nuts with a thoughtful design approach .
For example , Gene Yale in Chicago has a planting of 97 apple trees ( and other fruits ) in a 1/4 acre yard !
Our own yard is approximate 1/3 acre , though we have many acres in sheep pasture .
Coincidentally , the sheep also need some relief from the summer sun , so plantings just inside the electric fence ( protected by circular fence cages ) serve dual purposes .
In coming articles , we 'll talk about laying out plans , the types of fruits and nuts that are doing well here , and how to put it all together to begin executing your plan early this fall .
While this series will be about hardiness zone 7 , most of the plants involved are suitable in at least two other zones .
The G - 20 Debate Germany Warns US Not to Become ' Addicted to Borrowing '
The US has heavily criticized German austerity measures in recent days .
Now , Germany 's finance minister has fired back , warning against becoming addicted to deficit spending and noting that history has made the country extremely wary of national debt and inflation .
After running a series of complex computer simulations , researchers have found that flaws in the structure of magnetic nanoscale wires play an important role in determining the operating speed of novel devices using such nanowires to store and process information .
The finding , made by researchers from the National Institute of Standards and Technology , the University of Maryland , and the University of Paris XI , will help to deepen the physical understanding and guide the interpretation of future experiments of these next - generation devices .
Magnetic nanowires store information in discrete bands of magnetic spins .
One can imagine the nanowire like a straw sucking up and holding the liquid of a meticulously layered chocolate and vanilla milkshake , with the chocolate segments representing 1s and the vanilla 0s .
The boundaries between these layers are called domain walls .
Researchers manipulate the information stored on the nanowire using an electrical current to push the domain walls , and the information they enclose , through the wire and past immobile read and write heads .
Interpretations of experiments seeking to measure how domain walls move have largely ignored the effects of " disorder " — usually the result of defects or impurities in the structure of the nanowires .
To see how disorder affects the motion of these microscopic magnetic domains , NIST researchers and their colleagues introduced disorder into their computer simulations .
Their simulations showed that disorder , which causes friction within the nanowires , can increase the rate at which a current can move domain walls .
According to NIST physicist Mark Stiles , friction can cause the domain walls to move faster because they need to lose energy in order to move down the wire .
For example , when a gyroscope spins , it resists the force of gravity .
If a little friction is introduced into the gyroscope 's bearing , the gyroscope will fall over more quickly .
Similarly , in the absence of damping , a domain wall will only move from one side of the nanowire to the other .
Disorder within the nanowire enables the domain walls to lose energy , which gives them the freedom to " fall " down the length of the wire as they move back and forth .
" We can say that the domain wall is moving as if it were in a system that has considerably greater effective damping than the actual damping , " says NIST physicist and lead researcher Hongki Min .
" This increase in the effective damping is significant enough that it should affect the interpretation of most future domain wall experiments . "

" The state of funk today is kind of funked up . "
Such a dire musical proclamation comes from no less a groove guru than William Earl Collins .
Better known as Bootsy , the trailblazing bassist for James Brown in the early ' 70s and then George Clinton 's Parliament - Funkadelic through 1980 , Collins fears for the future of the music he helped pioneer .
The problem ?
Young people today , he lamented , just do n't know their history .
" If you say anything about those old musicians to youngsters today , most of them do n't have a clue , " Collins said .
" All they know is who their favorite bass player or guitarist is now .
They have no idea how to connect those dots , where this style or this music comes from . "
So , as one of the universe 's foremost funkmasters , Collins has decided to do something about it .
Starting July 1 , aspiring funkateers can enroll at Funk University , an online bass guitar school he is co-creating and curating with actor - entrepreneur Cory Danziger .
Collins himself will spread the gospel of groove through exclusive lectures on funk and the bass .
Guest professors will include a who's who of bassology : John B. Williams , Flea , Les Claypool and Victor Wooten will lead their own classes .
Funk U. students will also be provided with online lessons and periodic staff reviews of student performances .
In time , he said , the curriculum will expand to include other instruments and styles .
" It 's about music , " Collins , 58 , said .
" Because I play bass , we have to start there .
Because I 'm known for funk , we have to start with that .
But it 's really about the whole adventure of music .
We want to embrace everything that has something to do with music and creating . "
When discussing Funk U. , Collins dropped his comic funk exuberance ( there was no talk of " Casper , the holy ghost , " no paeons to the almighty downstroke , baby baba ) and came across more as an earnest , elder statesman of the Mothership .
It was not always thus .
In 1970 , when he was 19 , Collins ' band , the Pacemakers , was tapped to back James Brown after the Godfather 's own group split in a payment dispute .
In the 11 months that followed , Collins laid down vampy , propulsive bass lines for such classic tracks as " ( Get Up I Feel Like Being A ) Sex Machine , " " Soul Power " and " Talking Loud and Saying Nothing . "
Where James Brown Meets George Clinton
But the brash young Collins chafed under Brown 's notoriously rigid leadership .
" James Brown was not only a great teacher , but a father figure : I got more than just a lesson in music .
I got discipline , " recalled Collins , who grew up fatherless in Cincinnati .
" He took it so serious , I was like , ' Let me get a break from this mug , I mean , good Lord . ' "
In 1972 , Collins was recruited along with guitarist brother Phelps " Catfish " Collins by George Clinton to join the Parliament - Funkadelic juggernaut .
Clinton , the ringmaster of a sprawling funk freakshow , could n't have been more of a different leader from Brown , Collins said .
" He was more , ' Bring whatever you got to the party and let 's get down , ' which gave me an opportunity to open up and let everything out that I had inside , " Collins said .
The combined effect of the two musical schools gave birth to the Collins who would gain fame in his own right as a mad - hatted bandleader , a high priest of P - Funk , with its rock influences .
" I think I needed both , " he said .
" You need the discipline and you also need to know that you can experiment and you can open up and let your creative juices flow .
" I wanted to take those two things and bring them to this funk school . "
Of course , there are a few lessons that Collins -- a former connoisseur of more illicit fare who once tricked members of Brown 's band into taking LSD -- will be sidestepping .
" That is not part of the curriculum at all , " he said , laughing .
" But at the same time , we do not hide from what I went through .
As long as you 're honest with yourself , the youth especially respect it more .
" It was a deep time and somehow I made it through and I had fun with it and I do n't regret none of it . "
At its most powerful , Collins ' playing drives a song .
His bass is often laden in effects ; echo , distortion , a spacey " envelope " filter that makes it sound like a wet slap .
But the style of playing is unmistakably human .
Listen to Brown 's " Sex Machine " and , what seems like a lifetime later , Parliament 's " Mothership Connection . "
Collins ' bass simultaneously anchors and assaults both songs .
Under Brown 's tutelage , Collins learned to hit the listener on the bar 's first beat , disorienting traditional R&B audiences who had become accustomed to hearing a song accented on the second beat .
Collins inhabits that first beat .
He lives on the one .
Bootzilla : Rhinestone Rock Star Monster of a Doll
Until the school officially launches , Collins , who still lives in Cincinnati , will be in the studio and sending out periodic updates via Twitter ( sample : " Musicians -- Prof.
Collins is launching the world 's first Funk University " ) .
Classes will run $ 34.99 a month , $ 189.99 for a six - month semester and $ 349.99 for a full year .
Unfortunately , the funk - curious will be unable to sample individual lectures .
Response has been positive so far , says an F.U. rep , but the university is not releasing any numbers yet .
But even Bootzilla himself is unsure what kind of professor he 'll make , and one suspects there is a funky essence that can be taught in no classroom .
" I never looked at myself as a teacher , " he admitted .
" I am a good book .
All people have to do is read me . "
If Jason Segel sounds a bit restless in this GQ interview , it ’s understandable :
He ’s contractually obligated to stick around his CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother through an eighth season even though he ’s got Muppets movies to make and substantial supporting roles in films with Steve Carell , Jack Black , and Cameron Diaz on the agenda .
And seriously , when is that guy gonna meet his kids ’ mother already ?
So yeah , it ’s hard to blame Segel for sounding as though he ’s bowing out , even if his aspirations to be the next Peter Sellers seem a bit overreaching for a guy who 's been playing the same loveably blunt slacker - type for years now :
“ … When your idol is Peter Sellers , playing one character for eight years is n’t what you ’re trying to do .
I do n’t really feel like I have that much more to offer with this character .
Maybe if we got divorced or something — but that ’s not gonna happen .
It ’s gonna be some iteration of , like , my TV wife opens the fridge , and she ’s like , “ What happened to the birthday cake ? ”
And I walk in with a little frosting here [ points to corner of mouth ] like , “ What birthday cake ? ”

But lest you think Segel has completely checked out , he ’s still committed to doing his damndest to bring HIMYM to a satisfying conclusion — even if the writers do n’t necessarily want to hear it :
Interviewer :
You want to know my theory ?
We 're going to find out at some point that the mother 's dead .
And adult Ted has been telling them all these stories about the mother they never knew .
It 'll retroactively cast the entire show in this dark - comic light .
Segel : [ without missing a beat ] I suggested that also .
Really ?
Yeah .
How was that received ?
Scoffing .
They do n't care about what I say .
[ laughs ]
I had two other suggestions , too .
One is that they 're dead .
The two kids and their father — they 're dead , and they 're in purgatory , and he 's telling the story for eternity .
It 's the worst punishment ever !
They have to spend eternity listening to their dad 's boring stories .
And then my other suggestion , which they never used , which I think would be so funny , is — it 's the future , right ?
I think in one of those scenes , they should open the window , and it should be , like , a postapocalyptic wasteland outside .
It should be like I Am Legend .
Horrible mutants .

As much as that would probably be read as a “ betrayal ” of the fans who have spent so much time emotionally investing in its characters ( you ’ve been doing that , right ? ) , it ’s hard to argue with the idea that that ending would completely obliterate the Newhart finale .
[ GQ via Movieline ]
Israeli Army commander and top Likud member Uzi Dayan today warned on Israeli Army Radio that Israel would consider any attempt by the Turkish military to protect future aid ships from attack an “ act of war . ”
With Israeli protesters already condemning Erdogan , is war on the table ?
Dayan then added that if Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan attempted to accompany the aid ships personally , as he has reportedly considered “ we would not try to take over the ship he was on , but would sink it . ”
He added that Erdogan ’s presence on a future aid ship would also be a casus belli for an Israeli war against Turkey .
Turkey has expressed outrage at last week ’s Israeli attack on a Turkish aid ship bound for Gaza , an attack in which Israeli troops killed at least nine civilian aid workers .
Israel has insisted that the aid ship was secretly in league with al - Qaeda and has since tried to spin Turkey as the villain for even allowing a ship to try to deliver aid to the besieged strip .
The Israeli killings have only increased the number of groups planning attempts to deliver aid , and Israeli officials have promised to stop all these attempts militarily as well .
The explicit threat of war against Turkey is something new , however .
While Israel starts wars with a casualness rarely seen in other nations , an attack on Turkey , a key NATO member with an enormous military , would be something quite different from a monthlong attack on the Gaza Strip or blowing up metro Beirut with air strikes .

Science for sale

There are a few lessons to take away from this .
First , there are scientists who are for sale to the highest bidder .
They will say whatever their corporate paymasters tell them to say , valid or not .
Second , the news media rarely questions bogus science when it comes from corporations and corporate - funded " institutes " and usually reports it as true .
Third , the oil industry " science " that claims alcohol is an inefficient energy source is not only false , it 's phenomenally false .
Fourth , growing plants to make fuel ( as opposed to getting fuel from mining petroleum ) , takes more carbon dioxide out the air than alcohol fuel produces .
Fifth , " survival of the fittest " is not only a moral fraud , it has no basis in the science of biology .
Well conceived alcohol plants generate exponentially more energy than the non-renewable inputs required to operate them .
What does n't make sense is running alcohol plants with natural gas or coal ... operating these plants on a massive , centralized scale ... and turning the ethanol over the the oil companies to mix with gasoline .
It 's interesting that this is how they are being run now .
It 's almost as if they are being set up to fail spectacularly - and very publicly .
Alcohol for fuel can be produced locally and in a de-centralized way , very close to the fields where the crop inputs are grown , and distributed gasoline - style at local pumps .
A system like this is massively efficient and sustainable , cuts the oil companies out the picture completely , and will substantially strengthen the farming economy in the US and in any other nation that converts to alcohol as fuel .
You can see why oil companies and their allies who prefer centralized control ( and with it the ability to turn energy on and off and raise prices at will ) do n't want you to know these basic facts .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Using a combination of instruments on ESO 's Very Large Telescope , astronomers have discovered the most massive stars to date , one weighing at birth more than 300 times the mass of the sun , or twice as much as the currently accepted limit of 150 solar masses .
The existence of these monsters -- millions of times more luminous than the sun , losing weight through very powerful winds -- may provide an answer to the question , " how massive can stars be ? "
A team of astronomers led by Paul Crowther , Professor of Astrophysics at the University of Sheffield , has used ESO 's Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) , as well as archival data from the NASA / ESA Hubble Space Telescope , to study two young clusters of stars , NGC 3603 and RMC 136a in detail .
NGC 3603 is a cosmic factory where stars form frantically from the nebula 's extended clouds of gas and dust , located 22 000 light - years away from the Sun. RMC 136a ( more often known as R136 ) is another cluster of young , massive and hot stars , which is located inside the Tarantula Nebula , in one of our neighbouring galaxies , the Large Magellanic Cloud , 165 000 light - years away .
The team found several stars with surface temperatures over 40 000 degrees , more than seven times hotter than our Sun , and a few tens of times larger and several million times brighter .
Comparisons with models imply that several of these stars were born with masses in excess of 150 solar masses .
The star R136a1 , found in the R136 cluster , is the most massive star ever found , with a current mass of about 265 solar masses and with a birthweight of as much as 320 times that of the Sun .
In NGC 3603 , the astronomers could also directly measure the masses of two stars that belong to a double star system , as a validation of the models used .
The stars A1 , B and C in this cluster have estimated masses at birth above or close to 150 solar masses .
Very massive stars produce very powerful outflows .
" Unlike humans , these stars are born heavy and lose weight as they age , " says Paul Crowther .
" Being a little over a million years old , the most extreme star R136a1 is already ' middle - aged ' and has undergone an intense weight loss programme , shedding a fifth of its initial mass over that time , or more than fifty solar masses . "
R136 is a cluster of young , massive and hot stars located inside the Tarantula Nebula , in one of the Milky Way ’s neighbouring galaxies , the Large Magellanic Cloud , 165 000 light - years away .

If R136a1 replaced the Sun in our Solar System , it would outshine the Sun by as much as the Sun currently outshines the full Moon .
" Its high mass would reduce the length of the Earth 's year to three weeks , and it would bathe the Earth in incredibly intense ultraviolet radiation , rendering life on our planet impossible , " says Raphael Hirschi from Keele University , who belongs to the team .
These super heavyweight stars are extremely rare , forming solely within the densest star clusters .
Distinguishing the individual stars — which has now been achieved for the first time — requires the exquisite resolving power of the VLT 's infrared instruments .
The team also estimated the maximum possible mass for the stars within these clusters and the relative number of the most massive ones .
" The smallest stars are limited to more than about eighty times more than Jupiter , below which they are ' failed stars ' or brown dwarfs , " says team member Olivier Schnurr from the Astrophysikalisches Institut Potsdam .
" Our new finding supports the previous view that there is also an upper limit to how big stars can get , although it raises the limit by a factor of two , to about 300 solar masses . "
Within R136 , only four stars weighed more than 150 solar masses at birth , yet they account for nearly half of the wind and radiation power of the entire cluster , comprising approximately 100 000 stars in total .
R136a1 alone energises its surroundings by more than a factor of fifty compared to the Orion Nebula cluster , the closest region of massive star formation to Earth .
This artist 's impression shows the relative sizes of young stars , from the smallest " red dwarfs " , weighing in at about 0.1 solar masses , through low mass " yellow dwarfs " such as the Sun , to massive “ blue dwarf ” stars weighing eight times more than the Sun , as well as the 300 solar mass star named R136a1 .

Understanding how high mass stars form is puzzling enough , due to their very short lives and powerful winds , so that the identification of such extreme cases as R136a1 raises the challenge to theorists still further .
" Either they were born so big or smaller stars merged together to produce them , " explains Crowther .
Stars between about 8 and 150 solar masses explode at the end of their short lives as supernovae , leaving behind exotic remnants , either neutron stars or black holes .
Having now established the existence of stars weighing between 150 and 300 solar masses , the astronomers ' findings raise the prospect of the existence of exceptionally bright , " pair instability supernovae " that completely blow themselves apart , failing to leave behind any remnant and dispersing up to ten solar masses of iron into their surroundings .
A few candidates for such explosions have already been proposed in recent years .
Not only is R136a1 the most massive star ever found , but it also has the highest luminosity too , close to 10 million times greater than the Sun .
" Owing to the rarity of these monsters , I think it is unlikely that this new record will be broken any time soon , " concludes Crowther .

The Dead
LILY , the caretaker 's daughter , was literally run off her feet .
Hardly had she brought one gentleman into the little pantry behind the office on the ground floor and helped him off with his overcoat than the wheezy hall - door bell clanged again and she had to scamper along the bare hallway to let in another guest .
It was well for her she had not to attend to the ladies also .
But Miss Kate and Miss Julia had thought of that and had converted the bathroom upstairs into a ladies ' dressing - room .
Miss Kate and Miss Julia were there , gossiping and laughing and fussing , walking after each other to the head of the stairs , peering down over the banisters and calling down to Lily to ask her who had come .
It was always a great affair , the Misses Morkan 's annual dance .
Everybody who knew them came to it , members of the family , old friends of the family , the members of Julia 's choir , any of Kate 's pupils that were grown up enough , and even some of Mary Jane 's pupils too .
Never once had it fallen flat .
For years and years it had gone off in splendid style , as long as anyone could remember ; ever since Kate and Julia , after the death of their brother Pat , had left the house in Stoney Batter and taken Mary Jane , their only niece , to live with them in the dark , gaunt house on Usher 's Island , the upper part of which they had rented from Mr. Fulham , the corn-factor on the ground floor .
That was a good thirty years ago if it was a day .
Mary Jane , who was then a little girl in short clothes , was now the main prop of the household , for she had the organ in Haddington Road .
She had been through the Academy and gave a pupils ' concert every year in the upper room of the Antient Concert Rooms .
Many of her pupils belonged to the better - class families on the Kingstown and Dalkey line .
Old as they were , her aunts also did their share .
Julia , though she was quite grey , was still the leading soprano in Adam and Eve's , and Kate , being too feeble to go about much , gave music lessons to beginners on the old square piano in the back room .
Lily , the caretaker 's daughter , did housemaid 's work for them .
Though their life was modest , they believed in eating well ; the best of everything : diamond - bone sirloins , three - shilling tea and the best bottled stout .
But Lily seldom made a mistake in the orders , so that she got on well with her three mistresses .
They were fussy , that was all .
But the only thing they would not stand was back answers .
Of course , they had good reason to be fussy on such a night .
And then it was long after ten o'clock and yet there was no sign of Gabriel and his wife .
Besides they were dreadfully afraid that Freddy Malins might turn up screwed .
They would not wish for worlds that any of Mary Jane 's pupils should see him under the influence ; and when he was like that it was sometimes very hard to manage him .
Freddy Malins always came late , but they wondered what could be keeping Gabriel : and that was what brought them every two minutes to the banisters to ask Lily had Gabriel or Freddy come .
" O , Mr. Conroy , " said Lily to Gabriel when she opened the door for him , " Miss Kate and Miss Julia thought you were never coming .
Good - night , Mrs. Conroy . "
" I 'll engage they did , " said Gabriel , " but they forget that my wife here takes three mortal hours to dress herself . "
He stood on the mat , scraping the snow from his goloshes , while Lily led his wife to the foot of the stairs and called out :
" Miss Kate , here 's Mrs. Conroy . "
Kate and Julia came toddling down the dark stairs at once .
Both of them kissed Gabriel 's wife , said she must be perished alive , and asked was Gabriel with her .
" Here I am as right as the mail , Aunt Kate !
Go on up .
I 'll follow , " called out Gabriel from the dark .
He continued scraping his feet vigorously while the three women went upstairs , laughing , to the ladies ' dressing - room .
A light fringe of snow lay like a cape on the shoulders of his overcoat and like toecaps on the toes of his goloshes ; and , as the buttons of his overcoat slipped with a squeaking noise through the snow - stiffened frieze , a cold , fragrant air from out - of - doors escaped from crevices and folds .
" Is it snowing again , Mr. Conroy ? " asked Lily .
She had preceded him into the pantry to help him off with his overcoat .
Gabriel smiled at the three syllables she had given his surname and glanced at her .
She was a slim ; growing girl , pale in complexion and with hay - coloured hair .
The gas in the pantry made her look still paler .
Gabriel had known her when she was a child and used to sit on the lowest step nursing a rag doll .
" Yes , Lily , " he answered , " and I think we 're in for a night of it . "
He looked up at the pantry ceiling , which was shaking with the stamping and shuffling of feet on the floor above , listened for a moment to the piano and then glanced at the girl , who was folding his overcoat carefully at the end of a shelf .
" Tell me .
Lily , " he said in a friendly tone , " do you still go to school ? "
" O no , sir , " she answered .
" I 'm done schooling this year and more . "
" O , then , " said Gabriel gaily , " I suppose we 'll be going to your wedding one of these fine days with your young man , eh ? "
The girl glanced back at him over her shoulder and said with great bitterness :
" The men that is now is only all palaver and what they can get out of you . "
Gabriel coloured , as if he felt he had made a mistake and , without looking at her , kicked off his goloshes and flicked actively with his muffler at his patent - leather shoes .
He was a stout , tallish young man .
The high colour of his cheeks pushed upwards even to his forehead , where it scattered itself in a few formless patches of pale red ; and on his hairless face there scintillated restlessly the polished lenses and the bright gilt rims of the glasses which screened his delicate and restless eyes .
His glossy black hair was parted in the middle and brushed in a long curve behind his ears where it curled slightly beneath the groove left by his hat .
When he had flicked lustre into his shoes he stood up and pulled his waistcoat down more tightly on his plump body .
Then he took a coin rapidly from his pocket .
" O Lily , " he said , thrusting it into her hands , " it 's Christmastime , is n't it ?
Just ... here 's a little .... "
He walked rapidly towards the door .
" O no , sir ! " cried the girl , following him .
" Really , sir , I would n't take it . "
" Christmas - time ! Christmas - time ! " said Gabriel , almost trotting to the stairs and waving his hand to her in deprecation .
The girl , seeing that he had gained the stairs , called out after him :
" Well , thank you , sir . "
He waited outside the drawing - room door until the waltz should finish , listening to the skirts that swept against it and to the shuffling of feet .
He was still discomposed by the girl 's bitter and sudden retort .
It had cast a gloom over him which he tried to dispel by arranging his cuffs and the bows of his tie .
He then took from his waistcoat pocket a little paper and glanced at the headings he had made for his speech .
He was undecided about the lines from Robert Browning , for he feared they would be above the heads of his hearers .
Some quotation that they would recognise from Shakespeare or from the Melodies would be better .
The indelicate clacking of the men's heels and the shuffling of their soles reminded him that their grade of culture differed from his .
He would only make himself ridiculous by quoting poetry to them which they could not understand .
They would think that he was airing his superior education .
He would fail with them just as he had failed with the girl in the pantry .
He had taken up a wrong tone .
His whole speech was a mistake from first to last , an utter failure .
Just then his aunts and his wife came out of the ladies ' dressing - room .
His aunts were two small , plainly dressed old women .
Aunt Julia was an inch or so the taller .
Her hair , drawn low over the tops of her ears , was grey ; and grey also , with darker shadows , was her large flaccid face .
Though she was stout in build and stood erect , her slow eyes and parted lips gave her the appearance of a woman who did not know where she was or where she was going .
Aunt Kate was more vivacious .
Her face , healthier than her sister 's , was all puckers and creases , like a shrivelled red apple , and her hair , braided in the same old - fashioned way , had not lost its ripe nut colour .
They both kissed Gabriel frankly .
He was their favourite nephew the son of their dead elder sister , Ellen , who had married T. J. Conroy of the Port and Docks .
" Gretta tells me you 're not going to take a cab back to Monkstown tonight , Gabriel , " said Aunt Kate .
" No , " said Gabriel , turning to his wife , " we had quite enough of that last year , had n't we ?
Do n't you remember , Aunt Kate , what a cold Gretta got out of it ?
Cab windows rattling all the way , and the east wind blowing in after we passed Merrion .
Very jolly it was .
Gretta caught a dreadful cold . "
Aunt Kate frowned severely and nodded her head at every word .
" Quite right , Gabriel , quite right , " she said .
" You ca n't be too careful . "
" But as for Gretta there , " said Gabriel , " she 'd walk home in the snow if she were let . "
Mrs. Conroy laughed .
" Do n't mind him , Aunt Kate , " she said .
" He 's really an awful bother , what with green shades for Tom 's eyes at night and making him do the dumb - bells , and forcing Eva to eat the stirabout .
The poor child !
And she simply hates the sight of it !... O , but you 'll never guess what he makes me wear now ! "
She broke out into a peal of laughter and glanced at her husband , whose admiring and happy eyes had been wandering from her dress to her face and hair .
The two aunts laughed heartily , too , for Gabriel 's solicitude was a standing joke with them .
" Goloshes ! " said Mrs. Conroy .
" That 's the latest .
Whenever it's wet underfoot I must put on my galoshes .
Tonight even , he wanted me to put them on , but I would n't .
The next thing he 'll buy me will be a diving suit . "
Gabriel laughed nervously and patted his tie reassuringly , while Aunt Kate nearly doubled herself , so heartily did she enjoy the joke .
The smile soon faded from Aunt Julia 's face and her mirthless eyes were directed towards her nephew 's face .
After a pause she asked :
" And what are goloshes , Gabriel ? "
" Goloshes , Julia ! " exclaimed her sister " Goodness me , do n't you know what goloshes are ?
You wear them over your ... over your boots , Gretta , is n't it ? "
" Yes , " said Mrs. Conroy .
" Guttapercha things .
We both have a pair now .
Gabriel says everyone wears them on the Continent . "
" O , on the Continent , " murmured Aunt Julia , nodding her head slowly .
Gabriel knitted his brows and said , as if he were slightly angered :
" It 's nothing very wonderful , but Gretta thinks it very funny because she says the word reminds her of Christy Minstrels . "
" But tell me , Gabriel , " said Aunt Kate , with brisk tact .
" Of course , you 've seen about the room .
Gretta was saying ... "
" 0 , the room is all right , " replied Gabriel .
" I 've taken one in the Gresham . "
" To be sure , " said Aunt Kate , " by far the best thing to do .
And the children , Gretta , you 're not anxious about them ? "
" 0 , for one night , " said Mrs. Conroy .
" Besides , Bessie will look after them . "
" To be sure , " said Aunt Kate again .
" What a comfort it is to have a girl like that , one you can depend on !
There 's that Lily , I 'm sure I do n't know what has come over her lately .
She 's not the girl she was at all . "
Gabriel was about to ask his aunt some questions on this point , but she broke off suddenly to gaze after her sister , who had wandered down the stairs and was craning her neck over the banisters .
" Now , I ask you , " she said almost testily , " where is Julia going ?
Julia !
Julia !
Where are you going ? "
Julia , who had gone half way down one flight , came back and announced blandly :
" Here 's Freddy . "
At the same moment a clapping of hands and a final flourish of the pianist told that the waltz had ended .
The drawing - room door was opened from within and some couples came out .
Aunt Kate drew Gabriel aside hurriedly and whispered into his ear :
" Slip down , Gabriel , like a good fellow and see if he 's all right , and do n't let him up if he 's screwed .
I 'm sure he 's screwed .
I 'm sure he is . "
Gabriel went to the stairs and listened over the banisters .
He could hear two persons talking in the pantry .
Then he recognised Freddy Malins ' laugh .
He went down the stairs noisily .
" It 's such a relief , " said Aunt Kate to Mrs. Conroy , " that Gabriel is here .
I always feel easier in my mind when he 's here ....
Julia , there 's Miss Daly and Miss Power will take some refreshment .
Thanks for your beautiful waltz , Miss Daly .
It made lovely time . "
A tall wizen - faced man , with a stiff grizzled moustache and swarthy skin , who was passing out with his partner , said :
" And may we have some refreshment , too , Miss Morkan ? "
" Julia , " said Aunt Kate summarily , " and here 's Mr. Browne and Miss Furlong .
Take them in , Julia , with Miss Daly and Miss Power . "
" I'm the man for the ladies , " said Mr. Browne , pursing his lips until his moustache bristled and smiling in all his wrinkles .
" You know , Miss Morkan , the reason they are so fond of me is ----"
He did not finish his sentence , but , seeing that Aunt Kate was out of earshot , at once led the three young ladies into the back room .
The middle of the room was occupied by two square tables placed end to end , and on these Aunt Julia and the caretaker were straightening and smoothing a large cloth .
On the sideboard were arrayed dishes and plates , and glasses and bundles of knives and forks and spoons .
The top of the closed square piano served also as a sideboard for viands and sweets .
At a smaller sideboard in one corner two young men were standing , drinking hop - bitters .
Mr. Browne led his charges thither and invited them all , in jest , to some ladies ' punch , hot , strong and sweet .
As they said they never took anything strong , he opened three bottles of lemonade for them .
Then he asked one of the young men to move aside , and , taking hold of the decanter , filled out for himself a goodly measure of whisky .
The young men eyed him respectfully while he took a trial sip .
" God help me , " he said , smiling , " it 's the doctor 's orders . "
His wizened face broke into a broader smile , and the three young ladies laughed in musical echo to his pleasantry , swaying their bodies to and fro , with nervous jerks of their shoulders .
The boldest said :
" O , now , Mr. Browne , I 'm sure the doctor never ordered anything of the kind . "
Mr. Browne took another sip of his whisky and said , with sidling mimicry :
" Well , you see , I 'm like the famous Mrs. Cassidy , who is reported to have said : ' Now , Mary Grimes , if I do n't take it , make me take it , for I feel I want it . ' "
His hot face had leaned forward a little too confidentially and he had assumed a very low Dublin accent so that the young ladies , with one instinct , received his speech in silence .
Miss Furlong , who was one of Mary Jane 's pupils , asked Miss Daly what was the name of the pretty waltz she had played ; and Mr. Browne , seeing that he was ignored , turned promptly to the two young men who were more appreciative .
A red -faced young woman , dressed in pansy , came into the room , excitedly clapping her hands and crying :
" Quadrilles ! Quadrilles ! "
Close on her heels came Aunt Kate , crying :
" Two gentlemen and three ladies , Mary Jane ! "
" O , here 's Mr. Bergin and Mr. Kerrigan , " said Mary Jane .
" Mr. Kerrigan , will you take Miss Power ?
Miss Furlong , may I get you a partner , Mr. Bergin .
O , that 'll just do now . "
" Three ladies , Mary Jane , " said Aunt Kate .
The two young gentlemen asked the ladies if they might have the pleasure , and Mary Jane turned to Miss Daly .
" O , Miss Daly , you 're really awfully good , after playing for the last two dances , but really we 're so short of ladies tonight . "
" I do n't mind in the least , Miss Morkan . "
" But I 've a nice partner for you , Mr. Bartell D'Arcy , the tenor .
I 'll get him to sing later on .
All Dublin is raving about him . "
" Lovely voice , lovely voice ! " said Aunt Kate .
As the piano had twice begun the prelude to the first figure Mary Jane led her recruits quickly from the room .
They had hardly gone when Aunt Julia wandered slowly into the room , looking behind her at something .
" What is the matter , Julia ? " asked Aunt Kate anxiously .
" Who is it ? "
Julia , who was carrying in a column of table - napkins , turned to her sister and said , simply , as if the question had surprised her :
" It 's only Freddy , Kate , and Gabriel with him . "
In fact right behind her Gabriel could be seen piloting Freddy Malins across the landing .
The latter , a young man of about forty , was of Gabriel 's size and build , with very round shoulders .
His face was fleshy and pallid , touched with colour only at the thick hanging lobes of his ears and at the wide wings of his nose .
He had coarse features , a blunt nose , a convex and receding brow , tumid and protruded lips .
His heavy - lidded eyes and the disorder of his scanty hair made him look sleepy .
He was laughing heartily in a high key at a story which he had been telling Gabriel on the stairs and at the same time rubbing the knuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left eye .
" Good - evening , Freddy , " said Aunt Julia .
Freddy Malins bade the Misses Morkan good - evening in what seemed an offhand fashion by reason of the habitual catch in his voice and then , seeing that Mr. Browne was grinning at him from the sideboard , crossed the room on rather shaky legs and began to repeat in an undertone the story he had just told to Gabriel .
" He 's not so bad , is he ? " said Aunt Kate to Gabriel .
Gabriel 's brows were dark but he raised them quickly and answered :
" O , no , hardly noticeable . "
" Now , is n't he a terrible fellow ! " she said .
" And his poor mother made him take the pledge on New Year 's Eve .
But come on , Gabriel , into the drawing - room . "
Before leaving the room with Gabriel she signalled to Mr. Browne by frowning and shaking her forefinger in warning to and fro .
Mr. Browne nodded in answer and , when she had gone , said to Freddy Malins :
" Now , then , Teddy , I 'm going to fill you out a good glass of lemonade just to buck you up . "
Freddy Malins , who was nearing the climax of his story , waved the offer aside impatiently but Mr. Browne , having first called Freddy Malins ' attention to a disarray in his dress , filled out and handed him a full glass of lemonade .
Freddy Malins ' left hand accepted the glass mechanically , his right hand being engaged in the mechanical readjustment of his dress .
Mr. Browne , whose face was once more wrinkling with mirth , poured out for himself a glass of whisky while Freddy Malins exploded , before he had well reached the climax of his story , in a kink of high - pitched bronchitic laughter and , setting down his untasted and overflowing glass , began to rub the knuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left eye , repeating words of his last phrase as well as his fit of laughter would allow him .
Gabriel could not listen while Mary Jane was playing her Academy piece , full of runs and difficult passages , to the hushed drawing - room .
He liked music but the piece she was playing had no melody for him and he doubted whether it had any melody for the other listeners , though they had begged Mary Jane to play something .
Four young men , who had come from the refreshment - room to stand in the doorway at the sound of the piano , had gone away quietly in couples after a few minutes .
The only persons who seemed to follow the music were Mary Jane herself , her hands racing along the key - board or lifted from it at the pauses like those of a priestess in momentary imprecation , and Aunt Kate standing at her elbow to turn the page .
Gabriel 's eyes , irritated by the floor , which glittered with beeswax under the heavy chandelier , wandered to the wall above the piano .
A picture of the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet hung there and beside it was a picture of the two murdered princes in the Tower which Aunt Julia had worked in red , blue and brown wools when she was a girl .
Probably in the school they had gone to as girls that kind of work had been taught for one year .
His mother had worked for him as a birthday present a waistcoat of purple tabinet , with little foxes ' heads upon it , lined with brown satin and having round mulberry buttons .
It was strange that his mother had had no musical talent though Aunt Kate used to call her the brains carrier of the Morkan family .
Both she and Julia had always seemed a little proud of their serious and matronly sister .
Her photograph stood before the pierglass .
She held an open book on her knees and was pointing out something in it to Constantine who , dressed in a man - o - war suit , lay at her feet .
It was she who had chosen the name of her sons for she was very sensible of the dignity of family life .
Thanks to her , Constantine was now senior curate in Balbrigan and , thanks to her , Gabriel himself had taken his degree in the Royal University .
A shadow passed over his face as he remembered her sullen opposition to his marriage .
Some slighting phrases she had used still rankled in his memory ; she had once spoken of Gretta as being country cute and that was not true of Gretta at all .
It was Gretta who had nursed her during all her last long illness in their house at Monkstown .
He knew that Mary Jane must be near the end of her piece for she was playing again the opening melody with runs of scales after every bar and while he waited for the end the resentment died down in his heart .
The piece ended with a trill of octaves in the treble and a final deep octave in the bass .
Great applause greeted Mary Jane as , blushing and rolling up her music nervously , she escaped from the room .
The most vigorous clapping came from the four young men in the doorway who had gone away to the refreshment - room at the beginning of the piece but had come back when the piano had stopped .
Lancers were arranged .
Gabriel found himself partnered with Miss Ivors .
She was a frank - mannered talkative young lady , with a freckled face and prominent brown eyes .
She did not wear a low - cut bodice and the large brooch which was fixed in the front of her collar bore on it an Irish device and motto .
When they had taken their places she said abruptly :
" I have a crow to pluck with you . "
" With me ? " said Gabriel .
She nodded her head gravely .
" What is it ? " asked Gabriel , smiling at her solemn manner .
" Who is G. C. ? " answered Miss Ivors , turning her eyes upon him .
Gabriel coloured and was about to knit his brows , as if he did not understand , when she said bluntly :
" O , innocent Amy !
I have found out that you write for The Daily Express .
Now , are n't you ashamed of yourself ? "
" Why should I be ashamed of myself ? " asked Gabriel , blinking his eyes and trying to smile .
" Well , I 'm ashamed of you , " said Miss Ivors frankly .
" To say you 'd write for a paper like that .
I did n't think you were a West Briton . "
A look of perplexity appeared on Gabriel 's face .
It was true that he wrote a literary column every Wednesday in The Daily Express , for which he was paid fifteen shillings .
But that did not make him a West Briton surely .
The books he received for review were almost more welcome than the paltry cheque .
He loved to feel the covers and turn over the pages of newly printed books .
Nearly every day when his teaching in the college was ended he used to wander down the quays to the second - hand booksellers , to Hickey 's on Bachelor 's Walk , to Web 's or Massey 's on Aston 's Quay , or to O'Clohissey 's in the bystreet .
He did not know how to meet her charge .
He wanted to say that literature was above politics .
But they were friends of many years ' standing and their careers had been parallel , first at the University and then as teachers : he could not risk a grandiose phrase with her .
He continued blinking his eyes and trying to smile and murmured lamely that he saw nothing political in writing reviews of books .
When their turn to cross had come he was still perplexed and inattentive .
Miss Ivors promptly took his hand in a warm grasp and said in a soft friendly tone :
" Of course , I was only joking .
Come , we cross now . "
When they were together again she spoke of the University question and Gabriel felt more at ease .
A friend of hers had shown her his review of Browning 's poems .
That was how she had found out the secret : but she liked the review immensely .
Then she said suddenly :
" O , Mr. Conroy , will you come for an excursion to the Aran Isles this summer ?
We 're going to stay there a whole month .
It will be splendid out in the Atlantic .
You ought to come .
Mr. Clancy is coming , and Mr. Kilkelly and Kathleen Kearney .
It would be splendid for Gretta too if she 'd come .
She 's from Connacht , is n't she ? "
" Her people are , " said Gabriel shortly .
" But you will come , wo n't you ? " said Miss Ivors , laying her arm hand eagerly on his arm .
" The fact is , " said Gabriel , " I have just arranged to go ----"
" Go where ? " asked Miss Ivors .
" Well , you know , every year I go for a cycling tour with some fellows and so ----"
" But where ? " asked Miss Ivors .
" Well , we usually go to France or Belgium or perhaps Germany , " said Gabriel awkwardly .
" And why do you go to France and Belgium , " said Miss Ivors , " instead of visiting your own land ? "
" Well , " said Gabriel , " it 's partly to keep in touch with the languages and partly for a change . "
" And have n't you your own language to keep in touch with -- Irish ? " asked Miss Ivors .
" Well , " said Gabriel , " if it comes to that , you know , Irish is not my language . "
Their neighbours had turned to listen to the cross- examination .
Gabriel glanced right and left nervously and tried to keep his good humour under the ordeal which was making a blush invade his forehead .
" And have n't you your own land to visit , " continued Miss Ivors , " that you know nothing of , your own people , and your own country ? "
" 0 , to tell you the truth , " retorted Gabriel suddenly , " I 'm sick of my own country , sick of it ! "
" Why ? " asked Miss Ivors .
Gabriel did not answer for his retort had heated him .
" Why ? " repeated Miss Ivors .
They had to go visiting together and , as he had not answered her , Miss Ivors said warmly :
" Of course , you 've no answer . "
Gabriel tried to cover his agitation by taking part in the dance with great energy .
He avoided her eyes for he had seen a sour expression on her face .
But when they met in the long chain he was surprised to feel his hand firmly pressed .
She looked at him from under her brows for a moment quizzically until he smiled .
Then , just as the chain was about to start again , she stood on tiptoe and whispered into his ear :
" West Briton ! "
When the lancers were over Gabriel went away to a remote corner of the room where Freddy Malins ' mother was sitting .
She was a stout feeble old woman with white hair .
Her voice had a catch in it like her son's and she stuttered slightly .
She had been told that Freddy had come and that he was nearly all right .
Gabriel asked her whether she had had a good crossing .
She lived with her married daughter in Glasgow and came to Dublin on a visit once a year .
She answered placidly that she had had a beautiful crossing and that the captain had been most attentive to her .
She spoke also of the beautiful house her daughter kept in Glasgow , and of all the friends they had there .
While her tongue rambled on Gabriel tried to banish from his mind all memory of the unpleasant incident with Miss Ivors .
Of course the girl or woman , or whatever she was , was an enthusiast but there was a time for all things .
Perhaps he ought not to have answered her like that .
But she had no right to call him a West Briton before people , even in joke .
She had tried to make him ridiculous before people , heckling him and staring at him with her rabbit 's eyes .
He saw his wife making her way towards him through the waltzing couples .
When she reached him she said into his ear :
" Gabriel .
Aunt Kate wants to know wo n't you carve the goose as usual .
Miss Daly will carve the ham and I 'll do the pudding . "
" All right , " said Gabriel .
" She 's sending in the younger ones first as soon as this waltz is over so that we 'll have the table to ourselves . "
" Were you dancing ? " asked Gabriel .
" Of course I was .
Did n't you see me ?
What row had you with Molly Ivors ? "
" No row .
Why ?
Did she say so ? "
" Something like that .
I 'm trying to get that Mr. D'Arcy to sing .
He 's full of conceit , I think . "
" There was no row , " said Gabriel moodily , " only she wanted me to go for a trip to the west of Ireland and I said I would n't . "
His wife clasped her hands excitedly and gave a little jump .
" O , do go , Gabriel , " she cried .
" I 'd love to see Galway again . "
" You can go if you like , " said Gabriel coldly .
She looked at him for a moment , then turned to Mrs. Malins and said :
" There 's a nice husband for you , Mrs. Malins . "
While she was threading her way back across the room Mrs. Malins , without adverting to the interruption , went on to tell Gabriel what beautiful places there were in Scotland and beautiful scenery .
Her son - in - law brought them every year to the lakes and they used to go fishing .
Her son - in - law was a splendid fisher .
One day he caught a beautiful big fish and the man in the hotel cooked it for their dinner .
Gabriel hardly heard what she said .
Now that supper was coming near he began to think again about his speech and about the quotation .
When he saw Freddy Malins coming across the room to visit his mother Gabriel left the chair free for him and retired into the embrasure of the window .
The room had already cleared and from the back room came the clatter of plates and knives .
Those who still remained in the drawing room seemed tired of dancing and were conversing quietly in little groups .
Gabriel 's warm trembling fingers tapped the cold pane of the window .
How cool it must be outside !
How pleasant it would be to walk out alone , first along by the river and then through the park !
The snow would be lying on the branches of the trees and forming a bright cap on the top of the Wellington Monument .
How much more pleasant it would be there than at the supper - table !
He ran over the headings of his speech : Irish hospitality , sad memories , the Three Graces , Paris , the quotation from Browning .
He repeated to himself a phrase he had written in his review : " One feels that one is listening to a thought - tormented music . "
Miss Ivors had praised the review .
Was she sincere ?
Had she really any life of her own behind all her propagandism ?
There had never been any ill - feeling between them until that night .
It unnerved him to think that she would be at the supper - table , looking up at him while he spoke with her critical quizzing eyes .
Perhaps she would not be sorry to see him fail in his speech .
An idea came into his mind and gave him courage .
He would say , alluding to Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia : " Ladies and Gentlemen , the generation which is now on the wane among us may have had its faults but for my part I think it had certain qualities of hospitality , of humour , of humanity , which the new and very serious and hypereducated generation that is growing up around us seems to me to lack . "
Very good : that was one for Miss Ivors .
What did he care that his aunts were only two ignorant old women ?
A murmur in the room attracted his attention .
Mr. Browne was advancing from the door , gallantly escorting Aunt Julia , who leaned upon his arm , smiling and hanging her head .
An irregular musketry of applause escorted her also as far as the piano and then , as Mary Jane seated herself on the stool , and Aunt Julia , no longer smiling , half turned so as to pitch her voice fairly into the room , gradually ceased .
Gabriel recognised the prelude .
It was that of an old song of Aunt Julia 's -- Arrayed for the Bridal .
Her voice , strong and clear in tone , attacked with great spirit the runs which embellish the air and though she sang very rapidly she did not miss even the smallest of the grace notes .
To follow the voice , without looking at the singer 's face , was to feel and share the excitement of swift and secure flight .
Gabriel applauded loudly with all the others at the close of the song and loud applause was borne in from the invisible supper - table .
It sounded so genuine that a little colour struggled into Aunt Julia 's face as she bent to replace in the music - stand the old leather - bound songbook that had her initials on the cover .
Freddy Malins , who had listened with his head perched sideways to hear her better , was still applauding when everyone else had ceased and talking animatedly to his mother who nodded her head gravely and slowly in acquiescence .
At last , when he could clap no more , he stood up suddenly and hurried across the room to Aunt Julia whose hand he seized and held in both his hands , shaking it when words failed him or the catch in his voice proved too much for him .
" I was just telling my mother , " he said , " I never heard you sing so well , never .
No , I never heard your voice so good as it is tonight .
Now !
Would you believe that now ?
That 's the truth .
Upon my word and honour that 's the truth .
I never heard your voice sound so fresh and so ... so clear and fresh , never . "
Aunt Julia smiled broadly and murmured something about compliments as she released her hand from his grasp .
Mr. Browne extended his open hand towards her and said to those who were near him in the manner of a showman introducing a prodigy to an audience :
" Miss Julia Morkan , my latest discovery ! "
He was laughing very heartily at this himself when Freddy Malins turned to him and said :
" Well , Browne , if you 're serious you might make a worse discovery .
All I can say is I never heard her sing half so well as long as I am coming here .
And that 's the honest truth . "
" Neither did I , " said Mr. Browne .
" I think her voice has greatly improved . "
Aunt Julia shrugged her shoulders and said with meek pride :
" Thirty years ago I had n't a bad voice as voices go . "
" I often told Julia , " said Aunt Kate emphatically , " that she was simply thrown away in that choir .
But she never would be said by me . "
She turned as if to appeal to the good sense of the others against a refractory child while Aunt Julia gazed in front of her , a vague smile of reminiscence playing on her face .
" No , " continued Aunt Kate , " she would n't be said or led by anyone , slaving there in that choir night and day , night and day .
Six o'clock on Christmas morning !
And all for what ? "
" Well , is n't it for the honour of God , Aunt Kate ? " asked Mary Jane , twisting round on the piano - stool and smiling .
Aunt Kate turned fiercely on her niece and said :
" I know all about the honour of God , Mary Jane , but I think it 's not at all honourable for the pope to turn out the women out of the choirs that have slaved there all their lives and put little whipper - snappers of boys over their heads .
I suppose it is for the good of the Church if the pope does it .
But it 's not just , Mary Jane , and it 's not right . "
She had worked herself into a passion and would have continued in defence of her sister for it was a sore subject with her but Mary Jane , seeing that all the dancers had come back , intervened pacifically :
" Now , Aunt Kate , you 're giving scandal to Mr. Browne who is of the other persuasion . "
Aunt Kate turned to Mr. Browne , who was grinning at this allusion to his religion , and said hastily :
" O , I do n't question the pope 's being right .
I 'm only a stupid old woman and I would n't presume to do such a thing .
But there 's such a thing as common everyday politeness and gratitude .
And if I were in Julia 's place I 'd tell that Father Healey straight up to his face ... "
" And besides , Aunt Kate , " said Mary Jane , " we really are all hungry and when we are hungry we are all very quarrelsome . "
" And when we are thirsty we are also quarrelsome , " added Mr. Browne .
" So that we had better go to supper , " said Mary Jane , " and finish the discussion afterwards . "
On the landing outside the drawing - room Gabriel found his wife and Mary Jane trying to persuade Miss Ivors to stay for supper .
But Miss Ivors , who had put on her hat and was buttoning her cloak , would not stay .
She did not feel in the least hungry and she had already overstayed her time .
" But only for ten minutes , Molly , " said Mrs. Conroy .
" That wo n't delay you . "
" To take a pick itself , " said Mary Jane , " after all your dancing . "
" I really could n't , " said Miss Ivors .
" I am afraid you did n't enjoy yourself at all , " said Mary Jane hopelessly .
" Ever so much , I assure you , " said Miss Ivors , " but you really must let me run off now . "
" But how can you get home ? " asked Mrs. Conroy .
" O , it 's only two steps up the quay . "
Gabriel hesitated a moment and said :
" If you will allow me , Miss Ivors , I 'll see you home if you are really obliged to go . "
But Miss Ivors broke away from them .
" I wo n't hear of it , " she cried .
" For goodness ' sake go in to your suppers and do n't mind me .
I 'm quite well able to take care of myself . "
" Well , you 're the comical girl , Molly , " said Mrs. Conroy frankly .
" Beannacht libh , " cried Miss Ivors , with a laugh , as she ran down the staircase .
Mary Jane gazed after her , a moody puzzled expression on her face , while Mrs. Conroy leaned over the banisters to listen for the hall - door .
Gabriel asked himself was he the cause of her abrupt departure .
But she did not seem to be in ill humour : she had gone away laughing .
He stared blankly down the staircase .
At the moment Aunt Kate came toddling out of the supper - room , almost wringing her hands in despair .
" Where is Gabriel ? " she cried .
" Where on earth is Gabriel ?
There 's everyone waiting in there , stage to let , and nobody to carve the goose ! "
" Here I am , Aunt Kate ! " cried Gabriel , with sudden animation , " ready to carve a flock of geese , if necessary . "
A fat brown goose lay at one end of the table and at the other end , on a bed of creased paper strewn with sprigs of parsley , lay a great ham , stripped of its outer skin and peppered over with crust crumbs , a neat paper frill round its shin and beside this was a round of spiced beef .
Between these rival ends ran parallel lines of side - dishes : two little minsters of jelly , red and yellow ; a shallow dish full of blocks of blancmange and red jam , a large green leaf - shaped dish with a stalk - shaped handle , on which lay bunches of purple raisins and peeled almonds , a companion dish on which lay a solid rectangle of Smyrna figs , a dish of custard topped with grated nutmeg , a small bowl full of chocolates and sweets wrapped in gold and silver papers and a glass vase in which stood some tall celery stalks .
In the centre of the table there stood , as sentries to a fruit - stand which upheld a pyramid of oranges and American apples , two squat old - fashioned decanters of cut glass , one containing port and the other dark sherry .
On the closed square piano a pudding in a huge yellow dish lay in waiting and behind it were three squads of bottles of stout and ale and minerals , drawn up according to the colours of their uniforms , the first two black , with brown and red labels , the third and smallest squad white , with transverse green sashes .
Gabriel took his seat boldly at the head of the table and , having looked to the edge of the carver , plunged his fork firmly into the goose .
He felt quite at ease now for he was an expert carver and liked nothing better than to find himself at the head of a well - laden table .
" Miss Furlong , what shall I send you ? " he asked .
" A wing or a slice of the breast ? "
" Just a small slice of the breast . "
" Miss Higgins , what for you ? "
" O , anything at all , Mr. Conroy . "
While Gabriel and Miss Daly exchanged plates of goose and plates of ham and spiced beef Lily went from guest to guest with a dish of hot floury potatoes wrapped in a white napkin .
This was Mary Jane 's idea and she had also suggested apple sauce for the goose but Aunt Kate had said that plain roast goose without any apple sauce had always been good enough for her and she hoped she might never eat worse .
Mary Jane waited on her pupils and saw that they got the best slices and Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia opened and carried across from the piano bottles of stout and ale for the gentlemen and bottles of minerals for the ladies .
There was a great deal of confusion and laughter and noise , the noise of orders and counter - orders , of knives and forks , of corks and glass - stoppers .
Gabriel began to carve second helpings as soon as he had finished the first round without serving himself .
Everyone protested loudly so that he compromised by taking a long draught of stout for he had found the carving hot work .
Mary Jane settled down quietly to her supper but Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia were still toddling round the table , walking on each other 's heels , getting in each other 's way and giving each other unheeded orders .
Mr. Browne begged of them to sit down and eat their suppers and so did Gabriel but they said there was time enough , so that , at last , Freddy Malins stood up and , capturing Aunt Kate , plumped her down on her chair amid general laughter .
When everyone had been well served Gabriel said , smiling :
" Now , if anyone wants a little more of what vulgar people call stuffing let him or her speak . "
A chorus of voices invited him to begin his own supper and Lily came forward with three potatoes which she had reserved for him .
" Very well , " said Gabriel amiably , as he took another preparatory draught , " kindly forget my existence , ladies and gentlemen , for a few minutes . "
He set to his supper and took no part in the conversation with which the table covered Lily 's removal of the plates .
The subject of talk was the opera company which was then at the Theatre Royal .
Mr. Bartell D'Arcy , the tenor , a dark - complexioned young man with a smart moustache , praised very highly the leading contralto of the company but Miss Furlong thought she had a rather vulgar style of production .
Freddy Malins said there was a Negro chieftain singing in the second part of the Gaiety pantomime who had one of the finest tenor voices he had ever heard .
" Have you heard him ? " he asked Mr. Bartell D'Arcy across the table .
" No , " answered Mr. Bartell D'Arcy carelessly .
" Because , " Freddy Malins explained , " now I 'd be curious to hear your opinion of him .
I think he has a grand voice . "
" It takes Teddy to find out the really good things , " said Mr. Browne familiarly to the table .
" And why could n't he have a voice too ? " asked Freddy Malins sharply .
" Is it because he 's only a black ? "
Nobody answered this question and Mary Jane led the table back to the legitimate opera .
One of her pupils had given her a pass for Mignon .
Of course it was very fine , she said , but it made her think of poor Georgina Burns .
Mr. Browne could go back farther still , to the old Italian companies that used to come to Dublin -- Tietjens , Ilma de Murzka , Campanini , the great Trebelli , Giuglini , Ravelli , Aramburo .
Those were the days , he said , when there was something like singing to be heard in Dublin .
He told too of how the top gallery of the old Royal used to be packed night after night , of how one night an Italian tenor had sung five encores to Let me like a Soldier fall , introducing a high C every time , and of how the gallery boys would sometimes in their enthusiasm unyoke the horses from the carriage of some great prima donna and pull her themselves through the streets to her hotel .
Why did they never play the grand old operas now , he asked , Dinorah , Lucrezia Borgia ?
Because they could not get the voices to sing them : that was why .
" Oh , well , " said Mr. Bartell D'Arcy , " I presume there are as good singers today as there were then . "
" Where are they ? " asked Mr. Browne defiantly .
" In London , Paris , Milan , " said Mr. Bartell D'Arcy warmly .
" I suppose Caruso , for example , is quite as good , if not better than any of the men you have mentioned . "
" Maybe so , " said Mr. Browne .
" But I may tell you I doubt it strongly . "
" O , I 'd give anything to hear Caruso sing , " said Mary Jane .
" For me , " said Aunt Kate , who had been picking a bone , " there was only one tenor .
To please me , I mean .
But I suppose none of you ever heard of him . "
" Who was he , Miss Morkan ? " asked Mr. Bartell D'Arcy politely .
" His name , " said Aunt Kate , " was Parkinson .
I heard him when he was in his prime and I think he had then the purest tenor voice that was ever put into a man 's throat . "
" Strange , " said Mr. Bartell D'Arcy .
" I never even heard of him . "
" Yes , yes , Miss Morkan is right , " said Mr. Browne .
" I remember hearing of old Parkinson but he 's too far back for me . "
" A beautiful , pure , sweet , mellow English tenor , " said Aunt Kate with enthusiasm .
Gabriel having finished , the huge pudding was transferred to the table .
The clatter of forks and spoons began again .
Gabriel 's wife served out spoonfuls of the pudding and passed the plates down the table .
Midway down they were held up by Mary Jane , who replenished them with raspberry or orange jelly or with blancmange and jam .
The pudding was of Aunt Julia 's making and she received praises for it from all quarters
She herself said that it was not quite brown enough .
" Well , I hope , Miss Morkan , " said Mr. Browne , " that I 'm brown enough for you because , you know , I 'm all brown . "
All the gentlemen , except Gabriel , ate some of the pudding out of compliment to Aunt Julia .
As Gabriel never ate sweets the celery had been left for him .
Freddy Malins also took a stalk of celery and ate it with his pudding .
He had been told that celery was a capital thing for the blood and he was just then under doctor 's care .
Mrs. Malins , who had been silent all through the supper , said that her son was going down to Mount Melleray in a week or so .
The table then spoke of Mount Melleray , how bracing the air was down there , how hospitable the monks were and how they never asked for a penny - piece from their guests .
" And do you mean to say , " asked Mr. Browne incredulously , " that a chap can go down there and put up there as if it were a hotel and live on the fat of the land and then come away without paying anything ? "
" O , most people give some donation to the monastery when they leave . " said Mary Jane .
" I wish we had an institution like that in our Church , " said Mr. Browne candidly .
He was astonished to hear that the monks never spoke , got up at two in the morning and slept in their coffins .
He asked what they did it for .
" That 's the rule of the order , " said Aunt Kate firmly .
" Yes , but why ? " asked Mr. Browne .
Aunt Kate repeated that it was the rule , that was all .
Mr. Browne still seemed not to understand .
Freddy Malins explained to him , as best he could , that the monks were trying to make up for the sins committed by all the sinners in the outside world .
The explanation was not very clear for Mr. Browne grinned and said :
" I like that idea very much but would n't a comfortable spring bed do them as well as a coffin ? "
" The coffin , " said Mary Jane , " is to remind them of their last end . "
As the subject had grown lugubrious it was buried in a silence of the table during which Mrs.
Malins could be heard saying to her neighbour in an indistinct undertone :
" They are very good men , the monks , very pious men . "
The raisins and almonds and figs and apples and oranges and chocolates and sweets were now passed about the table and Aunt Julia invited all the guests to have either port or sherry .
At first Mr. Bartell D'Arcy refused to take either but one of his neighbours nudged him and whispered something to him upon which he allowed his glass to be filled .
Gradually as the last glasses were being filled the conversation ceased .
A pause followed , broken only by the noise of the wine and by unsettlings of chairs .
The Misses Morkan , all three , looked down at the tablecloth .
Someone coughed once or twice and then a few gentlemen patted the table gently as a signal for silence .
The silence came and Gabriel pushed back his chair
The patting at once grew louder in encouragement and then ceased altogether .
Gabriel leaned his ten trembling fingers on the tablecloth and smiled nervously at the company .
Meeting a row of upturned faces he raised his eyes to the chandelier .
The piano was playing a waltz tune and he could hear the skirts sweeping against the drawing - room door .
People , perhaps , were standing in the snow on the quay outside , gazing up at the lighted windows and listening to the waltz music .
The air was pure there .
In the distance lay the park where the trees were weighted with snow .
The Wellington Monument wore a gleaming cap of snow that flashed westward over the white field of Fifteen Acres .
He began :
" Ladies and Gentlemen ,
" It has fallen to my lot this evening , as in years past , to perform a very pleasing task but a task for which I am afraid my poor powers as a speaker are all too inadequate . "
" No , no ! " said Mr. Browne .
" But , however that may be , I can only ask you tonight to take the will for the deed and to lend me your attention for a few moments while I endeavour to express to you in words what my feelings are on this occasion .
" Ladies and Gentlemen , it is not the first time that we have gathered together under this hospitable roof , around this hospitable board .
It is not the first time that we have been the recipients -- or perhaps , I had better say , the victims -- of the hospitality of certain good ladies . "
He made a circle in the air with his arm and paused .
Everyone laughed or smiled at Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia and Mary Jane who all turned crimson with pleasure .
Gabriel went on more boldly :
" I feel more strongly with every recurring year that our country has no tradition which does it so much honour and which it should guard so jealously as that of its hospitality .
It is a tradition that is unique as far as my experience goes ( and I have visited not a few places abroad ) among the modern nations .
Some would say , perhaps , that with us it is rather a failing than anything to be boasted of .
But granted even that , it is , to my mind , a princely failing , and one that I trust will long be cultivated among us .
Of one thing , at least , I am sure .
As long as this one roof shelters the good ladies aforesaid -- and I wish from my heart it may do so for many and many a long year to come -- the tradition of genuine warm - hearted courteous Irish hospitality , which our forefathers have handed down to us and which we in turn must hand down to our descendants , is still alive among us . "
A hearty murmur of assent ran round the table .
It shot through Gabriel 's mind that Miss Ivors was not there and that she had gone away discourteously : and he said with confidence in himself :
" Ladies and Gentlemen ,
" A new generation is growing up in our midst , a generation actuated by new ideas and new principles .
It is serious and enthusiastic for these new ideas and its enthusiasm , even when it is misdirected , is , I believe , in the main sincere .
But we are living in a sceptical and , if I may use the phrase , a thought - tormented age : and sometimes I fear that this new generation , educated or hypereducated as it is , will lack those qualities of humanity , of hospitality , of kindly humour which belonged to an older day .
Listening tonight to the names of all those great singers of the past it seemed to me , I must confess , that we were living in a less spacious age .
Those days might , without exaggeration , be called spacious days : and if they are gone beyond recall let us hope , at least , that in gatherings such as this we shall still speak of them with pride and affection , still cherish in our hearts the memory of those dead and gone great ones whose fame the world will not willingly let die . "
" Hear , hear ! " said Mr. Browne loudly .
" But yet , " continued Gabriel , his voice falling into a softer inflection , " there are always in gatherings such as this sadder thoughts that will recur to our minds : thoughts of the past , of youth , of changes , of absent faces that we miss here tonight .
Our path through life is strewn with many such sad memories : and were we to brood upon them always we could not find the heart to go on bravely with our work among the living .
We have all of us living duties and living affections which claim , and rightly claim , our strenuous endeavours .
" Therefore , I will not linger on the past .
I will not let any gloomy moralising intrude upon us here tonight .
Here we are gathered together for a brief moment from the bustle and rush of our everyday routine .
We are met here as friends , in the spirit of good - fellowship , as colleagues , also to a certain extent , in the true spirit of camaraderie , and as the guests of -- what shall I call them ? -- the Three Graces of the Dublin musical world . "
The table burst into applause and laughter at this allusion .
Aunt Julia vainly asked each of her neighbours in turn to tell her what Gabriel had said .
" He says we are the Three Graces , Aunt Julia , " said Mary Jane .
Aunt Julia did not understand but she looked up , smiling , at Gabriel , who continued in the same vein :
" Ladies and Gentlemen ,
" I will not attempt to play tonight the part that Paris played on another occasion .
I will not attempt to choose between them .
The task would be an invidious one and one beyond my poor powers .
For when I view them in turn , whether it be our chief hostess herself , whose good heart , whose too good heart , has become a byword with all who know her , or her sister , who seems to be gifted with perennial youth and whose singing must have been a surprise and a revelation to us all tonight , or , last but not least , when I consider our youngest hostess , talented , cheerful , hard - working and the best of nieces , I confess , Ladies and Gentlemen , that I do not know to which of them I should award the prize . "
Gabriel glanced down at his aunts and , seeing the large smile on Aunt Julia 's face and the tears which had risen to Aunt Kate 's eyes , hastened to his close .
He raised his glass of port gallantly , while every member of the company fingered a glass expectantly , and said loudly :
" Let us toast them all three together .
Let us drink to their health , wealth , long life , happiness and prosperity and may they long continue to hold the proud and self - won position which they hold in their profession and the position of honour and affection which they hold in our hearts . "
All the guests stood up , glass in hand , and turning towards the three seated ladies , sang in unison , with Mr. Browne as leader :
For they are jolly gay fellows ,
For they are jolly gay fellows ,
For they are jolly gay fellows ,
Which nobody can deny .
Aunt Kate was making frank use of her handkerchief and even Aunt Julia seemed moved .
Freddy Malins beat time with his pudding - fork and the singers turned towards one another , as if in melodious conference , while they sang with emphasis :
Unless he tells a lie ,
Unless he tells a lie ,
Then , turning once more towards their hostesses , they sang :
For they are jolly gay fellows ,
For they are jolly gay fellows ,
For they are jolly gay fellows ,
Which nobody can deny .
The acclamation which followed was taken up beyond the door of the supper - room by many of the other guests and renewed time after time , Freddy Malins acting as officer with his fork on high .
The piercing morning air came into the hall where they were standing so that Aunt Kate said :
" Close the door , somebody .
Mrs. Malins will get her death of cold . "
" Browne is out there , Aunt Kate , " said Mary Jane .
" Browne is everywhere , " said Aunt Kate , lowering her voice .
Mary Jane laughed at her tone .
" Really , " she said archly , " he is very attentive . "
" He has been laid on here like the gas , " said Aunt Kate in the same tone , " all during the Christmas . "
She laughed herself this time good - humouredly and then added quickly :
" But tell him to come in , Mary Jane , and close the door .
I hope to goodness he did n't hear me . "
At that moment the hall - door was opened and Mr. Browne came in from the doorstep , laughing as if his heart would break .
He was dressed in a long green overcoat with mock astrakhan cuffs and collar and wore on his head an oval fur cap .
He pointed down the snow - covered quay from where the sound of shrill prolonged whistling was borne in .
" Teddy will have all the cabs in Dublin out , " he said .
Gabriel advanced from the little pantry behind the office , struggling into his overcoat and , looking round the hall , said :
" Gretta not down yet ? "
" She 's getting on her things , Gabriel , " said Aunt Kate .
" Who 's playing up there ? " asked Gabriel .
" Nobody .
They 're all gone . "
" O no , Aunt Kate , " said Mary Jane .
" Bartell D'Arcy and Miss O'Callaghan are n't gone yet . "
" Someone is fooling at the piano anyhow , " said Gabriel .
Mary Jane glanced at Gabriel and Mr. Browne and said with a shiver :
" It makes me feel cold to look at you two gentlemen muffled up like that .
I would n't like to face your journey home at this hour . "
" I 'd like nothing better this minute , " said Mr. Browne stoutly , " than a rattling fine walk in the country or a fast drive with a good spanking goer between the shafts . "
" We used to have a very good horse and trap at home , " said Aunt Julia sadly .
" The never - to - be - forgotten Johnny , " said Mary Jane , laughing .
Aunt Kate and Gabriel laughed too .
" Why , what was wonderful about Johnny ? " asked Mr. Browne .
" The late lamented Patrick Morkan , our grandfather , that is , " explained Gabriel , " commonly known in his later years as the old gentleman , was a glue - boiler . "
" O , now , Gabriel , " said Aunt Kate , laughing , " he had a starch mill . "
" Well , glue or starch , " said Gabriel , " the old gentleman had a horse by the name of Johnny .
And Johnny used to work in the old gentleman 's mill , walking round and round in order to drive the mill .
That was all very well ; but now comes the tragic part about Johnny .
One fine day the old gentleman thought he'd like to drive out with the quality to a military review in the park . "
" The Lord have mercy on his soul , " said Aunt Kate compassionately .
" Amen , " said Gabriel .
" So the old gentleman , as I said , harnessed Johnny and put on his very best tall hat and his very best stock collar and drove out in grand style from his ancestral mansion somewhere near Back Lane , I think . "
Everyone laughed , even Mrs. Malins , at Gabriel 's manner and Aunt Kate said :
" O , now , Gabriel , he did n't live in Back Lane , really .
Only the mill was there . "
" Out from the mansion of his forefathers , " continued Gabriel , " he drove with Johnny .
And everything went on beautifully until Johnny came in sight of King Billy 's statue : and whether he fell in love with the horse King Billy sits on or whether he thought he was back again in the mill , anyhow he began to walk round the statue . "
Gabriel paced in a circle round the hall in his goloshes amid the laughter of the others .
" Round and round he went , " said Gabriel , " and the old gentleman , who was a very pompous old gentleman , was highly indignant .
' Go on , sir !
What do you mean , sir ?
Johnny !
Johnny !
Most extraordinary conduct !
Ca n't understand the horse ! "
The peal of laughter which followed Gabriel 's imitation of the incident was interrupted by a resounding knock at the hall door .
Mary Jane ran to open it and let in Freddy Malins .
Freddy Malins , with his hat well back on his head and his shoulders humped with cold , was puffing and steaming after his exertions .
" I could only get one cab , " he said .
" O , we 'll find another along the quay , " said Gabriel .
" Yes , " said Aunt Kate .
" Better not keep Mrs. Malins standing in the draught . "
Mrs. Malins was helped down the front steps by her son and Mr. Browne and , after many manoeuvres , hoisted into the cab .
Freddy Malins clambered in after her and spent a long time settling her on the seat , Mr. Browne helping him with advice .
At last she was settled comfortably and Freddy Malins invited Mr. Browne into the cab .
There was a good deal of confused talk , and then Mr. Browne got into the cab .
The cabman settled his rug over his knees , and bent down for the address .
The confusion grew greater and the cabman was directed differently by Freddy Malins and Mr. Browne , each of whom had his head out through a window of the cab .
The difficulty was to know where to drop Mr. Browne along the route , and Aunt Kate , Aunt Julia and Mary Jane helped the discussion from the doorstep with cross-directions and contradictions and abundance of laughter .
As for Freddy Malins he was speechless with laughter .
He popped his head in and out of the window every moment to the great danger of his hat , and told his mother how the discussion was progressing , till at last Mr. Browne shouted to the bewildered cabman above the din of everybody 's laughter :
" Do you know Trinity College ? "
" Yes , sir , " said the cabman .
" Well , drive bang up against Trinity College gates , " said Mr. Browne , " and then we 'll tell you where to go .
You understand now ? "
" Yes , sir , " said the cabman .
" Make like a bird for Trinity College . "
" Right , sir , " said the cabman .
The horse was whipped up and the cab rattled off along the quay amid a chorus of laughter and adieus .
Gabriel had not gone to the door with the others .
He was in a dark part of the hall gazing up the staircase .
A woman was standing near the top of the first flight , in the shadow also .
He could not see her face but he could see the terra-cotta and salmon - pink panels of her skirt which the shadow made appear black and white .
It was his wife .
She was leaning on the banisters , listening to something .
Gabriel was surprised at her stillness and strained his ear to listen also .
But he could hear little save the noise of laughter and dispute on the front steps , a few chords struck on the piano and a few notes of a man 's voice singing .
He stood still in the gloom of the hall , trying to catch the air that the voice was singing and gazing up at his wife .
There was grace and mystery in her attitude as if she were a symbol of something .
He asked himself what is a woman standing on the stairs in the shadow , listening to distant music , a symbol of .
If he were a painter he would paint her in that attitude .
Her blue felt hat would show off the bronze of her hair against the darkness and the dark panels of her skirt would show off the light ones .
Distant Music he would call the picture if he were a painter .
The hall - door was closed ; and Aunt Kate , Aunt Julia and Mary Jane came down the hall , still laughing .
" Well , is n't Freddy terrible ? " said Mary Jane .
" He 's really terrible . "
Gabriel said nothing but pointed up the stairs towards where his wife was standing .
Now that the hall - door was closed the voice and the piano could be heard more clearly .
Gabriel held up his hand for them to be silent .
The song seemed to be in the old Irish tonality and the singer seemed uncertain both of his words and of his voice .
The voice , made plaintive by distance and by the singer 's hoarseness , faintly illuminated the cadence of the air with words expressing grief :
O , the rain falls on my heavy locks
And the dew wets my skin ,
My babe lies cold ...
" O , " exclaimed Mary Jane .
" It 's Bartell D'Arcy singing and he would n't sing all the night .
O , I 'll get him to sing a song before he goes . "
" O , do , Mary Jane , " said Aunt Kate .
Mary Jane brushed past the others and ran to the staircase , but before she reached it the singing stopped and the piano was closed abruptly .
" O , what a pity ! " she cried .
" Is he coming down , Gretta ? "
Gabriel heard his wife answer yes and saw her come down towards them .
A few steps behind her were Mr. Bartell D'Arcy and Miss O'Callaghan .
" O , Mr. D'Arcy , " cried Mary Jane , " it 's downright mean of you to break off like that when we were all in raptures listening to you . "
" I have been at him all the evening , " said Miss O'Callaghan , " and Mrs. Conroy , too , and he told us he had a dreadful cold and could n't sing . "
" O , Mr. D'Arcy , " said Aunt Kate , " now that was a great fib to tell . "
" Ca n't you see that I 'm as hoarse as a crow ? " said Mr. D'Arcy roughly .
He went into the pantry hastily and put on his overcoat .
The others , taken aback by his rude speech , could find nothing to say .
Aunt Kate wrinkled her brows and made signs to the others to drop the subject .
Mr. D'Arcy stood swathing his neck carefully and frowning .
" It 's the weather , " said Aunt Julia , after a pause .
" Yes , everybody has colds , " said Aunt Kate readily , " everybody . "
" They say , " said Mary Jane , " we have n't had snow like it for thirty years ; and I read this morning in the newspapers that the snow is general all over Ireland . "
" I love the look of snow , " said Aunt Julia sadly .
" So do I , " said Miss O'Callaghan .
" I think Christmas is never really Christmas unless we have the snow on the ground . "
" But poor Mr. D'Arcy does n't like the snow , " said Aunt Kate , smiling .
Mr. D'Arcy came from the pantry , fully swathed and buttoned , and in a repentant tone told them the history of his cold .
Everyone gave him advice and said it was a great pity and urged him to be very careful of his throat in the night air .
Gabriel watched his wife , who did not join in the conversation .
She was standing right under the dusty fanlight and the flame of the gas lit up the rich bronze of her hair , which he had seen her drying at the fire a few days before .
She was in the same attitude and seemed unaware of the talk about her
At last she turned towards them and Gabriel saw that there was colour on her cheeks and that her eyes were shining .
A sudden tide of joy went leaping out of his heart .
" Mr. D'Arcy , " she said , " what is the name of that song you were singing ? "
" It 's called The Lass of Aughrim , " said Mr. D'Arcy , " but I could n't remember it properly .
Why ?
Do you know it ? "
" The Lass of Aughrim , " she repeated .
" I could n't think of the name . "
" It 's a very nice air , " said Mary Jane .
" I 'm sorry you were not in voice tonight . "
" Now , Mary Jane , " said Aunt Kate , " do n't annoy Mr. D'Arcy .
I wo n't have him annoyed . "
Seeing that all were ready to start she shepherded them to the door , where good - night was said :
" Well , good - night , Aunt Kate , and thanks for the pleasant evening . "
" Good - night , Gabriel .
Good - night , Gretta ! "
" Good - night , Aunt Kate , and thanks ever so much .
Goodnight , Aunt Julia . "
" O , good - night , Gretta , I did n't see you . "
" Good - night , Mr. D'Arcy .
Good - night , Miss O'Callaghan . "
" Good - night , Miss Morkan . "
" Good - night , again . "
" Good - night , all .
Safe home . "
" Good - night .
Good night . "
The morning was still dark .
A dull , yellow light brooded over the houses and the river ; and the sky seemed to be descending .
It was slushy underfoot ; and only streaks and patches of snow lay on the roofs , on the parapets of the quay and on the area railings .
The lamps were still burning redly in the murky air and , across the river , the palace of the Four Courts stood out menacingly against the heavy sky .
She was walking on before him with Mr. Bartell D'Arcy , her shoes in a brown parcel tucked under one arm and her hands holding her skirt up from the slush .
She had no longer any grace of attitude , but Gabriel 's eyes were still bright with happiness .
The blood went bounding along his veins ; and the thoughts went rioting through his brain , proud , joyful , tender , valorous .
She was walking on before him so lightly and so erect that he longed to run after her noiselessly , catch her by the shoulders and say something foolish and affectionate into her ear .
She seemed to him so frail that he longed to defend her against something and then to be alone with her .
Moments of their secret life together burst like stars upon his memory .
A heliotrope envelope was lying beside his breakfast - cup and he was caressing it with his hand .
Birds were twittering in the ivy and the sunny web of the curtain was shimmering along the floor : he could not eat for happiness .
They were standing on the crowded platform and he was placing a ticket inside the warm palm of her glove .
He was standing with her in the cold , looking in through a grated window at a man making bottles in a roaring furnace .
It was very cold .
Her face , fragrant in the cold air , was quite close to his ; and suddenly he called out to the man at the furnace :
" Is the fire hot , sir ? "
But the man could not hear with the noise of the furnace .
It was just as well .
He might have answered rudely .
A wave of yet more tender joy escaped from his heart and went coursing in warm flood along his arteries .
Like the tender fire of stars moments of their life together , that no one knew of or would ever know of , broke upon and illumined his memory .
He longed to recall to her those moments , to make her forget the years of their dull existence together and remember only their moments of ecstasy .
For the years , he felt , had not quenched his soul or hers .
Their children , his writing , her household cares had not quenched all their souls ' tender fire .
In one letter that he had written to her then he had said : " Why is it that words like these seem to me so dull and cold ?
Is it because there is no word tender enough to be your name ? "
Like distant music these words that he had written years before were borne towards him from the past .
He longed to be alone with her .
When the others had gone away , when he and she were in the room in the hotel , then they would be alone together .
He would call her softly :
" Gretta ! "
Perhaps she would not hear at once : she would be undressing .
Then something in his voice would strike her .
She would turn and look at him ....
At the corner of Winetavern Street they met a cab .
He was glad of its rattling noise as it saved him from conversation .
She was looking out of the window and seemed tired .
The others spoke only a few words , pointing out some building or street .
The horse galloped along wearily under the murky morning sky , dragging his old rattling box after his heels , and Gabriel was again in a cab with her , galloping to catch the boat , galloping to their honeymoon .
As the cab drove across O'Connell Bridge Miss O'Callaghan said :
" They say you never cross O'Connell Bridge without seeing a white horse . "
" I see a white man this time , " said Gabriel .
" Where ? " asked Mr. Bartell D'Arcy .
Gabriel pointed to the statue , on which lay patches of snow .
Then he nodded familiarly to it and waved his hand .
" Good - night , Dan , " he said gaily .
When the cab drew up before the hotel , Gabriel jumped out and , in spite of Mr. Bartell D'Arcy 's protest , paid the driver .
He gave the man a shilling over his fare .
The man saluted and said :
" A prosperous New Year to you , sir . "
" The same to you , " said Gabriel cordially .
She leaned for a moment on his arm in getting out of the cab and while standing at the curbstone , bidding the others good - night .
She leaned lightly on his arm , as lightly as when she had danced with him a few hours before .
He had felt proud and happy then , happy that she was his , proud of her grace and wifely carriage .
But now , after the kindling again of so many memories , the first touch of her body , musical and strange and perfumed , sent through him a keen pang of lust .
Under cover of her silence he pressed her arm closely to his side ; and , as they stood at the hotel door , he felt that they had escaped from their lives and duties , escaped from home and friends and run away together with wild and radiant hearts to a new adventure .
An old man was dozing in a great hooded chair in the hall .
He lit a candle in the office and went before them to the stairs .
They followed him in silence , their feet falling in soft thuds on the thickly carpeted stairs .
She mounted the stairs behind the porter , her head bowed in the ascent , her frail shoulders curved as with a burden , her skirt girt tightly about her .
He could have flung his arms about her hips and held her still , for his arms were trembling with desire to seize her and only the stress of his nails against the palms of his hands held the wild impulse of his body in check .
The porter halted on the stairs to settle his guttering candle .
They halted , too , on the steps below him .
In the silence Gabriel could hear the falling of the molten wax into the tray and the thumping of his own heart against his ribs .
The porter led them along a corridor and opened a door .
Then he set his unstable candle down on a toilet - table and asked at what hour they were to be called in the morning .
" Eight , " said Gabriel .
The porter pointed to the tap of the electric - light and began a muttered apology , but Gabriel cut him short .
" We do n't want any light .
We have light enough from the street .
And I say , " he added , pointing to the candle , " you might remove that handsome article , like a good man . "
The porter took up his candle again , but slowly , for he was surprised by such a novel idea .
Then he mumbled good - night and went out .
Gabriel shot the lock to .
A ghastly light from the street lamp lay in a long shaft from one window to the door .
Gabriel threw his overcoat and hat on a couch and crossed the room towards the window .
He looked down into the street in order that his emotion might calm a little .
Then he turned and leaned against a chest of drawers with his back to the light .
She had taken off her hat and cloak and was standing before a large swinging mirror , unhooking her waist .
Gabriel paused for a few moments , watching her , and then said :
" Gretta ! "
She turned away from the mirror slowly and walked along the shaft of light towards him .
Her face looked so serious and weary that the words would not pass Gabriel 's lips .
No , it was not the moment yet .
" You looked tired , " he said .
" I am a little , " she answered .
" You do n't feel ill or weak ? "
" No , tired : that 's all . "
She went on to the window and stood there , looking out .
Gabriel waited again and then , fearing that diffidence was about to conquer him , he said abruptly :
" By the way , Gretta ! "
" What is it ? "
" You know that poor fellow Malins ? " he said quickly .
" Yes .
What about him ? "
" Well , poor fellow , he 's a decent sort of chap , after all , " continued Gabriel in a false voice .
" He gave me back that sovereign I lent him , and I did n't expect it , really .
It 's a pity he would n't keep away from that Browne , because he 's not a bad fellow , really . "
He was trembling now with annoyance .
Why did she seem so abstracted ?
He did not know how he could begin .
Was she annoyed , too , about something ?
If she would only turn to him or come to him of her own accord !
To take her as she was would be brutal .
No , he must see some ardour in her eyes first .
He longed to be master of her strange mood .
" When did you lend him the pound ? " she asked , after a pause .
Gabriel strove to restrain himself from breaking out into brutal language about the sottish Malins and his pound .
He longed to cry to her from his soul , to crush her body against his , to overmaster her .
But he said :
" O , at Christmas , when he opened that little Christmas - card shop in Henry Street . "
He was in such a fever of rage and desire that he did not hear her come from the window .
She stood before him for an instant , looking at him strangely .
Then , suddenly raising herself on tiptoe and resting her hands lightly on his shoulders , she kissed him .
" You are a very generous person , Gabriel , " she said .
Gabriel , trembling with delight at her sudden kiss and at the quaintness of her phrase , put his hands on her hair and began smoothing it back , scarcely touching it with his fingers .
The washing had made it fine and brilliant .
His heart was brimming over with happiness .
Just when he was wishing for it she had come to him of her own accord .
Perhaps her thoughts had been running with his .
Perhaps she had felt the impetuous desire that was in him , and then the yielding mood had come upon her .
Now that she had fallen to him so easily , he wondered why he had been so diffident .
He stood , holding her head between his hands .
Then , slipping one arm swiftly about her body and drawing her towards him , he said softly :
" Gretta , dear , what are you thinking about ? "
She did not answer nor yield wholly to his arm .
He said again , softly :
" Tell me what it is , Gretta .
I think I know what is the matter .
Do I know ? "
She did not answer at once .
Then she said in an outburst of tears :
" O , I am thinking about that song , The Lass of Aughrim . "
She broke loose from him and ran to the bed and , throwing her arms across the bed -rail , hid her face .
Gabriel stood stockstill for a moment in astonishment and then followed her .
As he passed in the way of the cheval - glass he caught sight of himself in full length , his broad , well - filled shirt - front , the face whose expression always puzzled him when he saw it in a mirror , and his glimmering gilt - rimmed eyeglasses .
He halted a few paces from her and said :
" What about the song ?
Why does that make you cry ? "
She raised her head from her arms and dried her eyes with the back of her hand like a child .
A kinder note than he had intended went into his voice .
" Why , Gretta ? " he asked .
" I am thinking about a person long ago who used to sing that song . "
" And who was the person long ago ? " asked Gabriel , smiling .
" It was a person I used to know in Galway when I was living with my grandmother , " she said .
The smile passed away from Gabriel 's face .
A dull anger began to gather again at the back of his mind and the dull fires of his lust began to glow angrily in his veins .
" Someone you were in love with ? " he asked ironically .
" It was a young boy I used to know , " she answered , " named Michael Furey .
He used to sing that song , The Lass of Aughrim .
He was very delicate . "
Gabriel was silent .
He did not wish her to think that he was interested in this delicate boy .
" I can see him so plainly , " she said , after a moment .
" Such eyes as he had : big , dark eyes !
And such an expression in them -- an expression ! "
" O , then , you are in love with him ? " said Gabriel .
" I used to go out walking with him , " she said , " when I was in Galway . "
A thought flew across Gabriel 's mind .
" Perhaps that was why you wanted to go to Galway with that Ivors girl ? " he said coldly .
She looked at him and asked in surprise :
" What for ? "
Her eyes made Gabriel feel awkward .
He shrugged his shoulders and said :
" How do I know ?
To see him , perhaps . "
She looked away from him along the shaft of light towards the window in silence .
" He is dead , " she said at length .
" He died when he was only seventeen .
Is n't it a terrible thing to die so young as that ? "
" What was he ? " asked Gabriel , still ironically .
" He was in the gasworks , " she said .
Gabriel felt humiliated by the failure of his irony and by the evocation of this figure from the dead , a boy in the gasworks .
While he had been full of memories of their secret life together , full of tenderness and joy and desire , she had been comparing him in her mind with another .
A shameful consciousness of his own person assailed him .
He saw himself as a ludicrous figure , acting as a pennyboy for his aunts , a nervous , well - meaning sentimentalist , orating to vulgarians and idealising his own clownish lusts , the pitiable fatuous fellow he had caught a glimpse of in the mirror .
Instinctively he turned his back more to the light lest she might see the shame that burned upon his forehead .
He tried to keep up his tone of cold interrogation , but his voice when he spoke was humble and indifferent .
" I suppose you were in love with this Michael Furey , Gretta , " he said .
" I was great with him at that time , " she said .
Her voice was veiled and sad .
Gabriel , feeling now how vain it would be to try to lead her whither he had purposed , caressed one of her hands and said , also sadly :
" And what did he die of so young , Gretta ?
Consumption , was it ? "
" I think he died for me , " she answered .
A vague terror seized Gabriel at this answer , as if , at that hour when he had hoped to triumph , some impalpable and vindictive being was coming against him , gathering forces against him in its vague world .
But he shook himself free of it with an effort of reason and continued to caress her hand .
He did not question her again , for he felt that she would tell him of herself .
Her hand was warm and moist : it did not respond to his touch , but he continued to caress it just as he had caressed her first letter to him that spring morning .
" It was in the winter , " she said , " about the beginning of the winter when I was going to leave my grandmother 's and come up here to the convent .
And he was ill at the time in his lodgings in Galway and would n't be let out , and his people in Oughterard were written to .
He was in decline , they said , or something like that .
I never knew rightly . "
She paused for a moment and sighed .
" Poor fellow , " she said .
" He was very fond of me and he was such a gentle boy .
We used to go out together , walking , you know , Gabriel , like the way they do in the country .
He was going to study singing only for his health .
He had a very good voice , poor Michael Furey . "
" Well ; and then ? " asked Gabriel .
" And then when it came to the time for me to leave Galway and come up to the convent he was much worse and I would n't be let see him so I wrote him a letter saying I was going up to Dublin and would be back in the summer , and hoping he would be better then . "
She paused for a moment to get her voice under control , and then went on :
" Then the night before I left , I was in my grandmother 's house in Nuns ' Island , packing up , and I heard gravel thrown up against the window .
The window was so wet I could n't see , so I ran downstairs as I was and slipped out the back into the garden and there was the poor fellow at the end of the garden , shivering . "
" And did you not tell him to go back ? " asked Gabriel .
" I implored of him to go home at once and told him he would get his death in the rain .
But he said he did not want to live .
I can see his eyes as well as well !
He was standing at the end of the wall where there was a tree . "
" And did he go home ? " asked Gabriel .
" Yes , he went home .
And when I was only a week in the convent he died and he was buried in Oughterard , where his people came from .
O , the day I heard that , that he was dead ! "
She stopped , choking with sobs , and , overcome by emotion , flung herself face downward on the bed , sobbing in the quilt .
Gabriel held her hand for a moment longer , irresolutely , and then , shy of intruding on her grief , let it fall gently and walked quietly to the window .
She was fast asleep .
Gabriel , leaning on his elbow , looked for a few moments unresentfully on her tangled hair and half - open mouth , listening to her deep - drawn breath .
So she had had that romance in her life : a man had died for her sake .
It hardly pained him now to think how poor a part he , her husband , had played in her life .
He watched her while she slept , as though he and she had never lived together as man and wife .
His curious eyes rested long upon her face and on her hair : and , as he thought of what she must have been then , in that time of her first girlish beauty , a strange , friendly pity for her entered his soul .
He did not like to say even to himself that her face was no longer beautiful , but he knew that it was no longer the face for which Michael Furey had braved death .
Perhaps she had not told him all the story .
His eyes moved to the chair over which she had thrown some of her clothes .
A petticoat string dangled to the floor .
One boot stood upright , its limp upper fallen down : the fellow of it lay upon its side .
He wondered at his riot of emotions of an hour before .
From what had it proceeded ?
From his aunt 's supper , from his own foolish speech , from the wine and dancing , the merry - making when saying good - night in the hall , the pleasure of the walk along the river in the snow .
Poor Aunt Julia !
She , too , would soon be a shade with the shade of Patrick Morkan and his horse .
He had caught that haggard look upon her face for a moment when she was singing Arrayed for the Bridal .
Soon , perhaps , he would be sitting in that same drawing - room , dressed in black , his silk hat on his knees .
The blinds would be drawn down and Aunt Kate would be sitting beside him , crying and blowing her nose and telling him how Julia had died .
He would cast about in his mind for some words that might console her , and would find only lame and useless ones .
Yes , yes : that would happen very soon .
The air of the room chilled his shoulders .
He stretched himself cautiously along under the sheets and lay down beside his wife .
One by one , they were all becoming shades .
Better pass boldly into that other world , in the full glory of some passion , than fade and wither dismally with age .
He thought of how she who lay beside him had locked in her heart for so many years that image of her lover 's eyes when he had told her that he did not wish to live .
Generous tears filled Gabriel 's eyes .
He had never felt like that himself towards any woman , but he knew that such a feeling must be love .
The tears gathered more thickly in his eyes and in the partial darkness he imagined he saw the form of a young man standing under a dripping tree .
Other forms were near .
His soul had approached that region where dwell the vast hosts of the dead .
He was conscious of , but could not apprehend , their wayward and flickering existence .
His own identity was fading out into a grey impalpable world : the solid world itself , which these dead had one time reared and lived in , was dissolving and dwindling .
A few light taps upon the pane made him turn to the window .
It had begun to snow again .
He watched sleepily the flakes , silver and dark , falling obliquely against the lamplight .
The time had come for him to set out on his journey westward .
Yes , the newspapers were right : snow was general all over Ireland .
It was falling on every part of the dark central plain , on the treeless hills , falling softly upon the Bog of Allen and , farther westward , softly falling into the dark mutinous Shannon waves .
It was falling , too , upon every part of the lonely churchyard on the hill where Michael Furey lay buried .
It lay thickly drifted on the crooked crosses and headstones , on the spears of the little gate , on the barren thorns .
His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling , like the descent of their last end , upon all the living and the dead .

Electron dynamics in molecular hydrogen following photoionisation by an attosecond laser pulse .
The remaining electron in the molecule ( depicted in green ) is measured experimentally and shown as a mountain landscape .
Hills and valleys correspond to a higher probability of finding the electron on the left and right side of the molecule respectively .

( PhysOrg.com ) -- Physicists in Europe have successfully glimpsed the motion of electrons in molecules .
The results are a major boon for the research world .
Knowing how electrons move within molecules will facilitate observations and fuel our understanding of chemical reactions .
Presented in the journal Nature , the study is supported via three EU - funded projects .
The physicists , led by Professor Marc Vrakking , Director of the Max Born Institute for Nonlinear Optics and Short Pulse Spectroscopy in Germany , used attosecond laser pulses to clinch this latest technical feat .
Scientists were unable to observe this motion in the past because of the extreme speediness of electrons .
An attosecond is a billionth of a billionth of a second .
Light covers a distance of less than 1 millionth of a millimetre during an attosecond .
This is basically equal to the distance from one end of a small molecule to the other .
By creating attosecond laser pulses , the scientists could snap ' pictures ' of electrons ' movements within molecules .
For the purposes of this study , the physicists looked at the hydrogen molecule ( H 2 ) - with just two protons and two electrons , experts call H2 the ' simplest molecule ' .
The team used their attosecond laser to determine how ionisation occurs within a hydrogen molecule .
During ionisation , one electron is removed from the molecule while the energy status of the other electron changes .
' In our experiment we were able to show for the first time that with the help of an attosecond laser we really have the ability to observe the movement of electrons in molecules , ' Professor Vrakking explained .
' First we irradiated a hydrogen molecule with an attosecond laser pulse .
This led to the removal of an electron from the molecule - the molecule was ionised .
In addition , we split the molecule into two parts using an infrared laser beam , just like with a tiny pair of scissors , ' he added .
' This allowed us to examine how the charge distributed itself between the two fragments - since one electron is missing , one fragment will be neutral and the other positively charged .
We knew where the remaining electron could be found namely in the neutral part . '
For the last 30 years or so , scientists have been using femtosecond lasers to look at molecules and atoms .
A femtosecond is one millionth of one billionth of a second , so it makes it 1,000 times slower than an attosecond .
It is easy to track the movement of molecules and atoms when femtosecond lasers are used .
Scientists helped drive this technology forward by developing attosecond lasers , which are benefitting diverse studies in natural sciences including the study outlined here .
Commenting on the calculations and the complexity of the problem , co-author Dr Matthias Kling of the Max - Planck Institut für Quantenoptik in Germany , said : ' We found out that also doubly excited states , i.e. with excitation of both electrons of molecular hydrogen , can contribute to the observed dynamics . '
Professor Vrakking concluded : ' We have not - as we originally expected - solved the problem .
On the contrary , we have merely opened a door .
But in fact this makes the entire project much more important and interesting .'

Within hours of the news on March 23 , 2005 , that 15 workers had been killed by an explosion at BP 's refinery in Texas City , Texas , John Browne , BP 's ambitious chief executive , dashed across the Atlantic from London on his private jet .
A spot check had already blamed human error for the explosion .
Ever since the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska in March 1989 , the industry knew , Big Oil 's enemies were always ready to pounce on any environmental calamity .
The corporation 's fate , Mr. Browne told BP executives , depended on avoiding the manner adopted 16 years earlier by Lawrence Rawl , Exxon 's chairman ....
A co-defendant in Michael Vick 's dogfighting case whom the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback was barred from associating with was shot late Thursday night outside a club that had been hosting a birthday party for Vick .
Vick , who turns 30 on Saturday , was neither involved nor present at a Virginia Beach , Va. , nightclub when Quanis Phillips was shot , Larry Woodward , an attorney for Vick , said Friday , according to The Associated Press .
Vick was prohibited from associating with Phillips as a condition of his release on probation , which stemmed from a dogfighting conviction and resulting 18 - month federal prison sentence .
" We are aware of the incident that occurred in Virginia early this morning and are in the process of gathering all of the facts , " the Eagles said in a statement .
" Until then , we will not have any comment on this matter . "
The Virginia Beach police said Vick is " of no interest to us " as police investigate , the Philadelphia Daily News reported .
According to spokesman Adam Bernstein , the Virginia Beach police received a 911 call from a cell phone at 2:11 a.m. ET .
An unnamed person reported hearing a verbal dispute and a subsequent gunshot in Virginia Beach 's Town Center section .
Officers responded to the scene at the 4600 block of Columbus Street , according to the Daily News , and were told a shooting victim was being driven to the hospital in a car the police later stopped .
The officers reported the victim and other witnesses as " very uncooperative , " though they described the shooter as a black man in a white Cadillac Escalade .
Bernstein said a man sustained non-life - threatening injuries in the shooting at around 2 a.m. outside the club Guadalajara .
Phillips , who was sentenced to 21 months in prison for his role in the dogfighting operation , was admitted to Sentara Virginia Beach General Hospital overnight , health system spokesman Dale Gauding said .
He was discharged early Friday afternoon .
Gauding said he was not able to discuss the nature of Phillips ' injuries because of privacy laws .
NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said the league is looking into the shooting .
NFL commissioner Roger Goodell reinstated Vick after he was suspended for two years last July and said at the time that Vick 's margin for error would be " extremely limited . "
Vick played sparingly last season but was expected to take on a larger role this year after the team traded starter Donovan McNabb in the offseason .
The team picked up an option and is to pay Vick $ 5.2 million this year .
Vick is also still on three years ' probation in the federal case and on a three - year suspended sentence for a state dogfighting conviction .
He is not allowed to associate with anyone convicted of a felony unless granted permission to do so by his probation officer .
It is unclear whether Phillips was invited to the party , which was hyped on social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter as " Michael Vick 's ALL WHITE 30th Birthday Bash . "
Tickets cost $ 50 , and the party was advertised as beginning at 9 p.m and ending at 2 a.m while promising a guest list that included NBA star Allen Iverson and Washington Redskins cornerback DeAngelo Hall , both natives of the area , and a host of B - list celebrities .
Hall said via his Twitter feed on Friday that he was not at the party .
Vick , who is holding a football camp at Hampton University this week , was on the field working with campers Friday afternoon , along with former Atlanta teammate Roddy White .
White said he and Vick had already left the party when the shooting took place .
At the football camp , Vick was asked by a reporter Friday afternoon whether he had any comment on the incident .
" Watch what you do .
Pick and choose your friends carefully .
You just can't put yourself in vulnerable situations , " Vick said .
On Thursday , Vick told reporters that he tells campers the truth when they ask about his previous troubles " because I do n't want them to follow in my footsteps .
... I want them to walk a straight path , do all the things right , and just live a good life , and be happy . "

President Barack Obama said on Tuesday that he can't intervene in the long - running case of a British hacker charged with breaking into U.S. military computers .
Gary McKinnon 's case came up during discussions with British Prime Minister David Cameron in Washington .
The U.K . Home Office is reviewing whether McKinnon 's medical condition is grounds to block his extradition to the U.S. , which was approved in 2006 .
McKinnon has yet to stand trial in the U.S. , where he was indicted by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in 2002 for hacking into 97 military and NASA computers between February 2001 and March 2002 .
He has been diagnosed with Asperger 's syndrome , a neurological disorder related to autism characterized by deficiencies in social interaction .
He would prefer to be prosecuted in the U.K. , but the Crown Prosecution Service has turned down the case because the U.S. has jurisdiction .
Obama said during a press conference with Cameron that by tradition U.S. presidents do not get involved in extraditions or prosecutions and that his " team will follow the law . "
" I trust that this will get resolved in a way that underscores the seriousness of the issue , but also underscores the fact that we work together and we can find an appropriate solution , " Obama said , according to a transcript .
Cameron , who voiced support for McKinnon 's case last year along with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg , said discussions with the U.S. are ongoing and that he did n't want to prejudice the case .
" We completely understand that Gary McKinnon stands accused of a very important and significant crime in terms of hacking into vital databases , " Cameron said .
" And nobody denies that is an important crime that has to be considered .
But I have had conversations with the U.S. ambassador , as well as raising it today with the President , about this issue , and I hope a way through can be found . "
McKinnon 's case has raised questions about the U.S. - U.K. extradition treaty , which some argue is lopsided and makes it easier for the U.S. to gain custody of suspects than for the U.K .
In May , Home Secretary Theresa May adjourned a judicial review of McKinnon 's case due to take place in the High Court .
The Home Office is still reviewing McKinnon 's case , a spokesman said on Wednesday .
McKinnon , who went by the name " Solo , " contends he was merely searching for proof of the existence UFOs and did n't harm the systems he is accused of hacking .
The U.S. military alleges that McKinnon deleted critical files from its computers , which hampered its efforts after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .

Han Han ’s speech in Xiamen University : Why China cannot be a cultural power
Hello , everybody .
It ’s the second time I am in Xiamen , the air ’s clean , no wonder everybody likes to walk .
Just now , when Mr. Deng mentioned something about patriotism , two lines came in my mind , not from me though , from others .
The first one is “ patriotism is the last sanctuary for scumbags ” , and the second one is “ the real patriotism is to protect the country from any kinds of persecutions by the government ” .
Today I ’ve prepared for the speech , I brought a script , to restrain myself in case you guys get persecuted because of my irresponsible speech .
Here we go .
Leaders , teachers , and students : Hi .
Do you know why China could n’t become a cultural power ?
Because in most of our speeches , “ leaders ” always come first , and our leaders are all illiterate .
Moreover , they are scared of culture ( or knowledge ) , but their job is to censor culture , so they can control culture .
How can a country ( controlled by these people ) become a cultural power ?
What do you say , leaders ?
Actually China has the potential to become a big cultural figure , let me tell you a story .
I served as a chief editor for a magazine that could n’t manage to publish until now .
The constitution bestows us with the freedom of the press , on the other hand our laws bestow our leaders with the freedom of preventing you from exercising the freedom of the press .
Something in the magazine could n’t pass the censorship — there is a cartoon , about a man , who does n’t wear any clothes — of course this is unbearable , because relevant laws and regulations specify that we can not put the private parts on public magazines , I understand this , so I cover the illegitimate part with a super big logo of the magazine .
Suddenly publisher and people from the censoring team say it ’s not okay either , they say “ now you covered the middle part of the person , it is a parade to our party central committee ( 挡中央=covering the middle , 党中央=party central committee , both pronounce the same ) .
My reaction was just like you guys – hit by thunder .
I thought to myself , my friend , it would be so much better if you invest such brilliant imagination into literary and artistic creation instead of censoring .
The story tells us that people are full of imagination .
Of course lots of things can only stay in our mind , we cannot carry them out , we cannot write about them , most of the time we cannot even talk about them .
We bear too many restrains , this is a rated country ( like rated movie ) , how can it be possible for a rated country to foster abundant culture ?
I am a comrade with rather few self - restrain , however when I write I still cannot help but keep in mind avoiding writing this policeman , this leader , this policy , this regulation , and this legislation ; skipping many histories , Tibet , Xinjiang , demonstrations ; not touching fads , pornography , boycotting , arts , but elegancy is what I am incapable of .
I am really incapable of that field , I am not Yu Qiuyu ( also writer ) .
The pieces I put on the net is rather free .
Many screen writers I know , like Ning Caishen who writes play and some script writers for drama , they suffer a lot .
I am thinking how a country with cultural environment like this can ever manage to become a cultural primacy .
Unless there is only China , North Korea and Afghanistan left on the earth .
North Korea is a cultural prohibited land , no question about that .
Afghanistan cannot spare to manage culture when they are not clear about their own situation .
Even so , there is writer who publish “ The Kite Runner ” , but regretfully the book is n’t published in Afghanistan either .
I think it is not impossible for Afghanistan to exceed China once they clear their domestic mess .
We should not stick to the Four Classic Novels or those Confucius stuffs during our so - called international communication , we all know that , it ’s like the girl ask about your wealth in a blind date , and you say your ancestors are rich .
It is useless .
The making of the tragedy has nothing to do with you guys .
Though saying has it that the route to North Korea is built by everybody ’s silence .
But on the one hand we are much stronger than North Korea , because we all know what it looks like ; on the other hand , I believe most of you guys are not silent , you are just harmonized , that is all .
In the history of China ’s pornography extermination , I think most of you know – you are college students after all , though these contents are gone in nowadays textbooks — that Teresa Teng ( 邓丽君 ) and Liu Wen Cheng ( 刘文正 ) are pornographic , low and obscene , just because the number of people who listen to their music increase , later when the whole country are listening to them , they are immediately not low nor obscene .
Only when we fight against cultural censorship , free phrases and words from the “ blocked words base ” except those of anti-humanity , could it be possible to make our country a cultural power .
Even if your names and my name go into the base , I believe there is a ceiling in the shield words base and every time a new word goes in , it pushes closer to the ceiling and crashing the whole thing down .
So I hope our workers in the press , our students and teachers , every one who loves and engages in culture including every webmaster can make an effort to decrease the amount of censorship and relieve words and webs that are blocked .
I also hope that our leaders – mind that these leaders are different from you guys – and our government can be confident enough to let go the culture .
I know that our leaders like to export our culture , this is a sign of a powerful country , but the thing is , the available cultures are too humble to go outside .
When our writers write , they are self - censoring every second , how can any presentable works be possible when they are born under such environment ?
In the whole world , you castrate all of the works like news reports and present them to the foreigners , hoping it would sell , are foreigners aliens to you ?
Whether China is a economic strong player I do n’t know , no conclusion can be drawn until the our real estates crashes ; but if a country grows big in culture , then it is a powerful country in real sense , and I see no risk of crashing ever for a country like this .
Let me come back to the blocked words base , the more entries it has , the weak the country ’s culture becomes .
But our government can justify themselves , they tell you it is to protect our teenagers , to maintain society stableness .
Culture is boundless , so they have the right to block any information and culture that harm our teens and sabotage society stableness .
If you nod to this , then someday sooner or later when you are accusing about your mistreatment , you will find yourself blocked with the charge of sabotaging society stableness .
In the end , whoever poses threats to the administrating party or their benefits will be condemned with the charges of harming teenagers and sabotaging society stableness .
If we become supporters of the Green Dam Project at that time , we will find culture is not the only thing dying .
So guys , we can not let this day come , otherwise we will all become jokes on the e-history - book our grand children receive from satellites .
Thank you all .
About Han Han :
High school drop - out ; writer ; hottest blogger on Sina ; car racer ; recently he was nominated for the 2010 TIME top 100 most influential leaders , artists , innovators and icons and poll has him ranked at # 12 !
I translated one of Han Han ’s post , Han Feng is a good cadre in China , and 97 % surveyed agree .
Hard disk systems have recently encounted a storage density ceiling .
Most methods in use today have a limit of a few hundred gigabytes per square inch thanks to perpendicular recording .
To try to keep storage density rising , scientists have looked at technologies from holographic storage to molecular polymers , but few have made it past the demonstration stage .
In a paper in Nature Photonics this week , researchers describe a way to combine two hard drive writing methods to store data at densities of up to one terabit per square inch , and suggest the media could be stable up to ten terabits per square inch .
Each of the two write methods deals with the issue of writing pieces of data very close together without affecting the bits around it .
When bits are tightly packed , an effect called superparamagnetism can kick in , where the tiny amount of heat created by the write head will accidentally flip nearby bits and ruin surrounding data .
As researchers attempt to pack data bits tighter into a surface , being able to write to an isolated bit without disturbing surrounding ones has become very challenging .
One of the methods , thermally - assisted magnetic recording ( TAR ) , heats an area of a small - grain surface to write it , and then cools the surface once the writing is done .
In TAR , the amount of heat , design of the media , and distance between bits keep superparamagetism at bay .
The heat also allows the material to magnetize more quickly , reducing the time it takes to write by a small amount .
The other writing method , bit - patterned recording ( BPR ) , writes to a surface that has " magnetic islands " lithographed in .
The islands isolate each write event so that superparamagnetic effects can't bleed into other bits .
Each of the methods alone do n't contribute huge improvements to data density , and can only get up to two to three hundred gigabits per square inch .
As far as practicality goes , TAR has been limited by the availability of the small grained media it needs , materials that stand up to the heating and cooling , and our ability to control the size of the area we heat .
BPR , for its part , needs a write head that specifically matches the size of its magnetic data islands .
When BPR and TAR 's powers are combined , though , each solves the other 's problem .
With BPR 's magnetic islands , small - grain media is no longer needed , and TAR ensures that only the bit that is heated is written , eliminating the need for a specific size of write head .
Together , they form a writing system that can limit bits to tiny areas on inexpensive surfaces , and do n't affect surrounding data bits .
The actual device used here routes lasers through a waveguide to a plasmonic antenna that does the writing .
When the light reaches the antenna , it is translated into a charge .
The antenna is shaped like ' E ' , with the two outer prongs serving as grounds , and the middle prong acting as a sort of lightning rod to concentrate the surface charge to a small area .
With a middle prong of 20 - 25 nanometers and each track separated by 24 nanometers , researchers found they could write to areas as small as 15 nanometers in diameter without affecting surrounding data .
The efficiency of the signal from waveguide to antenna was about 40 percent , though the overall error rate was low and the system could write at speeds of 250 megabits per second .
Researchers were easily able to obtain a density of one terabit per square inch , and posit that densities of 10 terabits per square inch are theoretically possible using this method .
Overall , the authors of the paper note that the high - density data recordings were high - quality , and that the hardware could be suited for use in lithography , biosensors , and nano - manipulation as well .
The next front runner in data storage density and type is far from clear — for example , a method that involved electron quantum holography was able to store 35 bits per electron , and various solid state technologies continue to vie for attention — but this combined bit - pattern and thermally - assisted magnetic recording seems sufficiently close to current hard disk drives to be viable .

Please send letters and make phone calls to the officials who can stop this blatant example of a canned hunt to save Handsome Hank and the other deer .
There were recent successful tours of the Seneca Army Depot ( Seneca County , NY ) to observe the white deer and other wildlife , as well as the habitat and the history .
Over 2000 people participated over 3 weekends .
I took the tour on Saturday and it was clear that areas were being prepared for hunting and that hunting stands were being placed for the annual hunt that is organized to " manage " the deer population , which are all enclosed behind fences .
On the way back to the start of the tours , we passed a handsome white buck posing for pictures along the fence .
He had no fear of cars or people .
For pictures and more information :
http://www.senecawhitedeer.org/
There is a general impression that the hunting is being " professionally " managed , but the person actually in charge is one of the last 6 - 8 Army employees with no wildlife management expertise .
I just received the following note from one of the organizers :
After yesterday 's tours at the Seneca Depot , our last day of very successful tours , and seeing the new tree stand right in the middle of Handsome Hank 's habitat at the Depot , it is very clear that the deer we have named Handsome Hank is being targeted to be killed in this year 's hunt , which starts in about three weeks at the Depot .
This is a tragic situation ;
Hank is a ' domesticated ' wild deer who will come up to the fence if you provide an apple .
It would be like shooting your family dog .
No ethical hunter would ever do this but .... some of these ' hunters ' only want a white deer trophy and do n't care about that aspect .
We do .
I need your help in trying to dissuade the Army Corps of Engineers from targeting Hank this fall .
Hank is the most photographed white deer in America and is probably 3.5 years old .
I think the new stand has been built in Hank 's territory as we have made Hank a symbol of what we are trying to achieve at the Depot .
We have a crown jewel of a natural resource , a world class tourism attraction that can benefit not only the economy of Seneca County but would also educate everyone about the value of wildlife and the need for habitat and open space .
Handsome Hank symbolizes what the Seneca Depot can become and what it could mean to educate the public about the value of wildlife and
habitat .
Please make an effort to save Hank .
Local efforts to stop the hunting in the Depot and / or to acquire the land for a wildlife watching / cultural history park have not been successful .
I had hoped that by now the herd would have professional managers and more humane methods , but that is not the case .
If we can't stop the hunting , please at least save Hank .

MEXICO CITY — A reputed gang leader wanted in the United States on gun and drug charges was taken into custody by Jamaican authorities on Tuesday as the furious search for him , which set off violent clashes in Kingston , the Jamaican capital , entered its second month .
Owen Ellington , commissioner of the police , the Jamaican Constabulary Force , later told reporters that the reputed gang leader , Christopher Coke , had been peacefully taken into custody while in a vehicle with the Rev. Al Miller , an evangelical preacher who helped arrange the recent surrender of Mr. Coke ’s brother and sister .
Mr. Miller told reporters that Mr. Coke had contacted him Tuesday and asked for help in turning himself in at the American Embassy in Kingston .
The two men were en route to the embassy when the police stopped the car and arrested Mr. Coke , he said .
Mr. Coke is willing to forgo an extradition hearing and face trial in the United States , said Mr. Miller , of the nondenominational Whole Life Ministry .
Although Reverend Miller was released at the scene , Mr. Ellington later called on him to turn himself in to the authorities for questioning .
While we absolutely adore our Nexus One -- now that it's got a bellyful of that fabulous frozen yogurt -- one of the most exciting Android additions shown off at Google I/ O is n't actually slated for Froyo : the ability to push apps and music over the air from computer to phone .
The underlying framework apparently is , though , and thus a bite - sized version of the functionality is already available at Google Code .

See how ( and see it in action ) right after the break .
The mysterious phenomenon known as quantum entanglement — where objects seemingly communicate at speeds faster than light to instantaneously influence one another , regardless of their distance apart — was famously dismissed by Einstein as " spooky action at a distance . "
New experiments could soon answer skeptics by enabling people to see entangled pulses of light with the naked eye .
Although Einstein rebelled against the notion of quantum entanglement , scientists have repeatedly proved that measuring one of an entangled pair of objects , such as a photon , immediately affects its counterpart no matter how great their separation — theoretically .
The current record distance is 144 kilometers , between the Canary Islands of La Palma and Tenerife .
Photons make up light — and the fact that scientists regularly entangle these tiny packets of energy raised the possibility that humans might actually be able to observe this effect .
Now experiments to shoot entangled photons at the human eye are under development , and should take place later this year .
" It 's fascinating that entanglement is something we could see with the naked eye — it brings us closer to this strange quantum phenomenon , " notes researcher Nicolas Gisin , a quantum physicist at the University of Geneva in Switzerland
Entanglement is measured by creating entangled particles , sending them to different detectors , and seeing how quickly a measurement on one influences the other .
The idea for this experiment is simply to replace the photon detectors with human vision .
Human retinas are surprisingly sensitive , capable of being triggered by roughly seven photons .
And although they only have an efficiency of about 7 percent ( of every 100 photons that enter the pupil , only about seven go on to reach the retina ) they have a dark count of virtually zero , meaning they generate few if any false positives .
" The eye can actually detect single photons , but the signals that light sends to the brain are suppressed unless there are about seven — otherwise you would see flashes of light all the time — even in complete darkness , " explains quantum physicist Seth Lloyd of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
First , Gisin and his colleagues will entangle a pair of photons , and then amplify these signals by entangling each of these photons with another ensemble of , say , 100 photons .
In the arrangement they are currently developing , one pulse of photons would then be sent at a person , whereas the other would be sent at a conventional photon detector to test what the volunteer saw , Gisin says .
" Although there 's no reason to have human eyes on both sides , the final experiments can involve that , " he added .
Gisin and his colleagues have posted their plans to arXiv.org and submitted the idea for more formal publication in the journal Physical Review A .
People should not jump to the conclusion that such experiments will entangle people with machines or other people on a quantum level , Gisin cautions .
Rather , " people will see photons that were entangled with each other , " he explains .
Although conventional photon detectors can already accomplish these results , " it 's fascinating from a human point of view — I would always prefer to see a galaxy with my naked eye rather than download a picture from the Internet , " says quantum physicist Sandu Popescu at the University of Bristol in England , who did not participate in this research .
" Also , it 's interesting that no one until now was motivated to consider this kind of detector — you normally want to use the best detector possible , not something like the human eye . "
Entanglement is usually thought of as a rather fragile phenomenon , he added , and such experiments could highlight that it is robust enough " as to survive a person detecting it — much stronger than people usually appreciate . "
Lloyd , who also is not part of the Gisin team for these experiments , said that it " would be pretty neat if you can still detect entanglement despite the fact you 're using the naked eye , which is an imperfect detector that is pretty lousy . "
He added : " It 's really solid work , and when they do have an experiment with a human , I want to be next on line . "

" We 're working hard to get this magical product into the hands of even more people around the world , including those in nine more countries next month . "
The press release also cites over 11,000 iPad- specific applications now available in the App Store .
Apple just three weeks ago announced that it had crossed the two - million threshold for iPad sales .
The company is also gearing up for its next round of international iPad launches set for next month , with the device set to go on sale in Austria , Belgium , Hong Kong , Ireland , Luxembourg , Mexico , Netherlands , New Zealand and Singapore .
Pricing and pre-order information for those countries is yet to be announced .
Crist now supports DADT repeal compromise
Charlie Crist , who previously opposed repealing Do n't Ask Don't Tell when he was a Republican but has since been under pressure to take a stand on current repeal efforts , will now support the repeal compromise , his spokesperson confirms to me .
Until recently , Crist had been saying that the current policy works .
But with the repeal compromise moving forward in Congress , both Republican Marco Rubio and Dem Kendrick Meek , each for their own reasons , have been pressuring Crist to take a stand on the compromise .
Now Crist is coming out for it .
His spokesperson , Michelle Todd , emails a statement from him :
" Ultimately , as in all military matters I defer to the Pentagon and to the Generals and what the Senate is doing today is giving them the ultimate authority to do what is best for our military .
So , I would be inclined to support the Senate 's action on this . "
Crist 's claim that the measure gives " ultimate authority " to the commanders appears to be a reference to the fact that the compromise mandates that the Pentagon complete its study before repeal is implemented .
Nonetheless , Crist 's support for the " Senate 's action " is equivalent to support for repeal , because that 's what the compromise does .
Crist 's backing of repeal is a reflection of how much his political situation has shifted since being driven from the GOP :
He now needs to compete with Meek for Dem votes , while simultaneously battling with Rubio for moderate Republicans .
He needs support from both camps -- hence his backing of repeal , even as he hedges a bit by suggesting he 's merely deferring to the commanders .
On Sunday , June 1 , 2008 a raging fire burned through the backlot of Universal Studios Hollywood .
The iconic King Kong exhibit was destroyed as four acres were scorched and burned on that day .
Larry Kurzweil , President Universal Studios Hollywood , said : “ King Kong has been an integral part of Universal Studios Hollywood for decades and , after the 2008 fire , we knew he had to be reintroduced as a new , groundbreaking , thoroughly over - the - top experience . ”
In the video after the break , Oscar® Winning Director Peter Jackson describes the new King Kong 360 3 - D attraction .
King Kong re-emerges this summer as a new signature attraction created under the direction of Peter Jackson on the Universal Studios Hollywood tram tour .
In the new attraction , guests will be given special 3 - D glasses as they enter a darkened soundstage aboard the Studio Tour trams and will be transported — via the magic of Surround Digital 3D projection — deep into a tangled jungle location .

Guests will survive a close encounter with a swarm of hungry raptors , only to be confronted by the terrifying presence of 35 ′ tall dinosaur behemoths , intent on attacking the tram and Studio Tour guests .
Suddenly , a 25 ′ tall gorilla appears – Kong himself !
The tram jolts and shudders as the guests find themselves caught in the middle of a titanic struggle between these colossal prehistoric foes – the great ape and carnivorous reptiles – action which sends the packed trams sliding ever closer to the edge of a bottomless chasm .
How real are the effects ?
Peter Jackson describes : “ When the tails of the dinosaurs or Kong ’s hands sweep past the tram , passengers will feel air blow across their faces .
When the dinosaurs bang or try and push the tram , passengers will feel the tram being moved around physically . ”

The addition of “ King Kong 360 3 - D ” coincides with other enhancements to Universal Hollywood ’s Studio Tour .
Out of the ashes of the fire , Universal Studios engaged in the most extensive backlot construction ever in their history , and includes re-creations of legendary Hollywood sets as well as introduction of brand - new shooting locations .
Studio trams were updated to become “ mobile movie theaters ” with state - of - the - art flat - screen high - definition monitors and digital playback systems .
The new high - definition monitors feature commentary from filmmakers , actors and personalities .
Clips from numerous movie and television productions , corresponding to sites visited along the Tour route , add a new dimension to the tour of backlot attractions , sets and facades .
So what do you think ?
Will you consider adding a trip to Universal Studios Hollywood on your next trip to California ?
I know I will .

Mortal Kombat - A Book Excerpt from Replay : The History of Video Games
By Tristan Donovan
[ Gamasutra is pleased to present an excerpt from Tristan Donovan 's new and extremely comprehensive book , Replay : The History of Video Games , which is available now in the U.S. and UK .
This extract covers the early '90s tumult in the U.S. caused by violent games -- with Senator Joe Lieberman going after Mortal Kombat and Night Trap . ]
On Wednesday 1st December 1994 , the Washington press corps gathered for a press conference called by Joseph Lieberman , the Democrat Senator for Connecticut .
Next to Lieberman on the stage was Bob Keeshan , aka Captain Kangaroo -- the USA 's favorite Saturday morning kids ' TV presenter .
Once the assorted reporters had taken their seats , they were shown footage from two of the latest video games to reach the market .
In one scene a digital image of an actor playing a martial arts fighter ripped the still - beating heart out of his opponent 's chest .
The next scene showed film footage of a young woman in a nightdress being dragged off - camera by vampires before the sound of a high - pitched drill being used to extract the victim 's blood is heard .
The games in question were Mortal Kombat and Night Trap , and , like many adults in the U.S. at the time , most of the people in the room were unaware of these games , let alone their gory content .
" We 're not talking Pac - Man or Space Invaders anymore , " Lieberman told the stunned journalists .
" We 're talking about video games that glorify violence and teach children to enjoy inflicting the most gruesome forms of cruelty imaginable . "
Captain Kangaroo told reporters he could " not believe anybody could go that far " and said the nation 's children were being exposed to such material in the name of greed .
" Violent video games may become the Cabbage Patch dolls of the 1993 holiday season , " Lieberman added .
" But Cabbage Patch dolls never oozed blood and kids were n't taught to rip off their heads . "
Video game makers were in the dock facing charges of corrupting the nation 's children .
Mortal Kombat
The industry had , of course , been here before .
There were the bomb threats that followed the hit - and - run driving game Death Race , the outrage over the pornographic Custer 's Revenge , and the 1985 protests about the release of Raid Over Moscow in the UK .
" In Raid Over Moscow you had to break through and bomb the Kremlin , " said Geoff Brown , founder of the game 's UK publisher US Gold .
" It was number one in the charts , hundreds of thousands of copies being sold to kids and CND took it upon themselves to picket our offices . [ 1 ]
I thought it was fantastic .
I mean how could it get any better ?
It was in every newspaper .
They were there every day .
We used to give them coffee and they used to walk around with banners like ' ban the bomb ' .
I kept saying you 'll be better off if you did n't keep coming here , it would actually sell less . "
But in late 1994 the game industry was n't laughing off the outrage .
There had been a growing sense that the video game industry would eventually end up facing the wrath of Washington 's politicians and the early 1990s had already seen some minor skirmish­es with lawmakers .
In June 1990 a Democratic Party member of the California Assembly called Sally Tanner tabled a law to ban games that featured alcohol or tobacco .
Among the games under threat of being outlawed was Roberta Williams ' 1987 children 's nursery rhyme - themed game Mixed - Up Mother Goose , which featured a pipe - smoking Old King Cole .
The game industry managed to get the law dropped after pointing out that Tanner 's application of the ban to video games and not other media was unfair .
Tobacco had also caused another headache for the game business in January 1990 when controversy erupted about Sega 's arcade racing games Hang - On and Super Monaco GP .
Unknown to tobacco manufacturers , both featured barely disguised adverts for cigarette brands such as Marlboro , which the game 's developers had included because it was in keeping with the tobacco - dominated advertising boards that adorned racetracks at the time .
When the row broke , tobacco companies such as Philip Morris threatened to sue , conscious of being accused of trying to peddle cigarettes to children as a result .
Sega agreed to remove them .
But the intervention of Lieberman and Captain Kangaroo took video game controversy to a whole new level .
Lieberman openly declared that what he really wanted was an outright ban , although the US constitution would probably not allow it .
Instead he , together with fellow Democrat Senator Herbert Kohl , organized a public inquiry to investigate the problem of violent games and called some of the leading lights of the game business to appear before it for questioning .
---
[ 1 ] CND , the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament , were a UK pressure group .
Raid Over Moscow also caused controversy in Finland , where a member of the country 's parliament prompted a debate about whether its sale should be allowed .
The events that led to the Senate 's inquiry began back in 1991 when artist John Tobias and programmer Ed Boon , who worked for Chicago - based arcade game manufacturer Midway , started thinking about their next project .
Street Fighter II had just become the biggest arcade hit for years and Midway wanted a fighting game of its own .
" We were fans of head - to - head arcade games and their appeal to the arcade crowd , " said Tobias .
" I was also a huge geek for Hong Kong martial arts cinema and was looking for an excuse to use some of those influences . "
Having agreed to create Midway 's answer to Street Fighter II , the pair started debating how they could make their game -- Mortal Kombat -- stand out from Capcom 's landmark game .
" A big goal of mine was to differentiate the visual qualities of Mortal Kombat from any of the other ' fighting ' products out there .
It was important for players to look at Mortal Kombat and know immediately that it was , at the very least , different , " said Tobias .
The arcades were already overflowing with fighting games and some arcade owners were already tiring of them .
" We purchased fighting games when they first came out , but after a while we stopped buying them , " said Bob Lawton , founder of New Hampshire arcade Funspot .
" The sequels were coming out at a pace we could n't keep up with and as soon as a new version was released , no - one wanted to play the older one . "
Tobias hit on the idea of using digitized footage of real - life actors , an approach that had already been used in a small number of coin - op games , such as Williams ' Narc and Atari Games ' fighting game Pit-Fighter .
" We thought that by using the digitizing technique we could achieve a high level of detail , given the size of the on - screen characters in an expedited amount of time , " he explained .
The team hired actors to play out the roles of their virtual fighters in the game and , after some touching up , imported their images into the game .
Aside from the digitized characters , Mortal Kombat did not stray far from the Street Fighter II formula , sticking to Capcom 's combination of secret moves , two - player action , and tactical brawling .
Until they started testing it , that is .
" There was an anti-climactic moment at the end that created the opportunity to do something cool , " said Tobias .
" We wanted to put a big exclamation point at the end by letting the winner really rub his victory in the face of the loser .
Once we saw the player reaction , the fact that they enjoyed it and were having fun , we knew it was a good idea . "
The " exclamation points " Tobias and Boon came up with were a selection of gory takedowns that could be enacted using secret button and joystick combinations when the game urges the player to " finish " their defeated opponent .
Tobias and Boon called these gruesome finishing moves " Fatalities " .
" We certainly were n't out to cause controversy .
We were out to serve the needs of our players and make sure that they enjoyed themselves while playing -- that was our number one goal all of the time , " said Tobias .
And enjoy themselves they did .
Mortal Kombat became the hottest game in the arcades since Street Fighter II , as players fought each other in the hope of delivering a brutal fatality move to their crushed opponent .
With Mortal Kombat taking the arcades by storm it was only a matter of time before it arrived on the home consoles .
Acclaim Entertainment snapped up the rights and converted the game to both the Sega Genesis and Super NES .
Sega approved the game complete with the violence from the arcade original , but Nintendo was more squeamish and insisted the fatalities were removed .
Acclaim told the Japanese giant that the fatalities were the selling point and removing them would give Sega the superior game .
Nintendo refused to change its mind and Acclaim grudgingly cut the gore from the Super NES edition .
With the home console versions of Midway 's arcade smash ready , Acclaim prepared one of the biggest game launches ever seen at that point .
The company declared that the launch day , Monday 13th September 1993 , was " Mortal Monday " and lavished $ 10 million on TV advertising to ram home Mortal Kombat 's arrival in U.S. homes .
Children and teenagers across the nation were inspired to start urging their parents to buy them a copy .
One of them was the nine - year - old son of Bill Anderson , the chief of staff for Lieberman .
Anderson was shocked at the violence in the game and told Lieberman about his son's request for a copy .
Lieberman decided to check it out for himself .
He too was shocked at a game that he saw as rewarding players for violent acts .
He delved further into the video games on sale in the shops and found Night Trap , one of the first games released on CD - ROM .
Night Trap began life back in the late 1980s as part of Axlon and Hasbro 's abandoned VHS videocassette console , the NEMO .
After the NEMO project collapsed , Axlon co-founder Tom Zito managed to recover the rights to the game and formed a development studio called Digital Pictures to bring the game out on the Sega CD , an add - on for the Sega Genesis that hosted some of the first games to be released on compact disc .
The goal of the game was to protect a group of teenage girls at a slumber party by setting traps for vampires .
Lieberman felt the scenes where the partygoers were dragged off by the vampires were sexist ; particularly a scene where a woman dressed in a nightgown is attacked in the bathroom .
After finding out that most console owners were under 16 and that most of the parents in Connecticut who he spoke to knew nothing about the content of the video games their children played , he decided to act .
The violent games Lieberman had homed in on were exceptions , but they justified the unease about video games that many parents felt .
It was a distrust that reflected the historical pattern of new forms of media or entertainment being viewed -- at least initially -- with suspicion .
Such reactions to new forms of media could be seen in Greek philosopher Plato 's criticisms of theatre and Hollywood 's " sin city " image during the late 1920s and 1930s .
As British psychologist Dr Tanya Byron noted in ' Safer Children in a Digital World ' , her 2008 report for the UK government : " The current debates on the ' harms ' of video games and the internet are the latest manifestations of a long tradition of concerns relating to the introduction of many new forms of media . "
It was a suspicion that had even caused games such as Lemmings , a 1991 puzzle game created by Scottish game studio DMA Design , to face criticism .
The game was a play on the popular myth that the rodents regularly commit mass suicide by jumping off cliffs .
It charged players with trying to save the creatures by leading them to safety while bouncy renditions of tunes such as " How Much Is That Doggy in the Window ? " played in the background .
But the inclusion of levels where the lemmings had to avoid rivers of lava and negotiate volcanic rocks before jumping into the fiery mouth of a demon to escape prompted one southern U.S. TV station to call for the game to be banned for its satanic imagery .
But such criticism was not just about video games .
The early 1990s were a time when fears about violence in society were particularly high on the U.S. political agenda .
Congress was debating whether to restrict violent TV programming and a new gun control law , the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act , was about to be signed into law by President Bill Clinton .
Other nations also shared America 's unease about Mortal Kombat .
Germany 's youth media watchdog the Bundesprüfstelle für Jugendgefährdende Medien banned the game outright in 1994 for its extreme violence .
Until then the only games outlawed in this way were a bunch of free neo -Nazi propaganda games that started circulating around Germany and Austria at the end of the 1980s . [ 2 ]

These racist and anti-Semitic games were not released commercially , but distributed for free and , apparently , quite widely .
One newspaper poll of Austrian students reported that 22 per cent of students had encountered these games , which included concentration camp management games and quizzes testing how Aryan the player was .
The Bundesprüfstelle für Jugendgefährdende Medien banned seven such games between 1987 and 1990 .
The first day of the Senate inquiry into video games was set to take place on the 9th December 1993 , just eight days after Liberman 's press conference with Captain Kangaroo .
Ahead of the hearings Nintendo , Sega and the other video game publishers in the firing line suddenly realized just how poorly connected they were in Washington , D.C. While many of them belonged to the Software Publishers '
Association , its focus was on supporting business software companies such as Lotus and Microsoft rather than video game publishers .

With the political pressure mounting , Sega and Nintendo found themselves forced together to try and come up with a strategy for tackling the hearings .
The two harbored conflicting views of what should happen .
Sega , with its more teenage audience , wanted an age rating system so it could carry on publishing games featuring violence .
Nintendo , on the other hand , saw little need for an age rating system as it had its own family friendly policies that it applied to all games released on its console .
But with the pressure on , the U.S. 's leading game companies agreed to back an age - rating system that would be managed by the industry itself in the hope of defusing the row .
This opening gambit took some of the heat out of the situation , but the proponents of video game restrictions at the hearings still tried their best to land some blows on the game makers .
Marilyn Droz , vice - president of the National Coalition on Television Violence , asked senators how they would feel if their teenage daughter went on a date with someone who had just played Night Trap .
Eugene Provenzo , the University of Miami professor who had already annoyed the game business with his critical 1991 book Video Kids : Making Sense of Nintendo , also made the case for intervention .
Drawing on his research , Provenzo told the hearings that 40 of the 47 games he examined for his book were violent .
Video games were also " overwhelmingly " racist , sexist , and violent , he added .
There was some truth in Provenzo 's claim .
Female and black video game heroes were a rarity and this absence was still pronounced years later as a 2001 report by US children 's charity Children Now discovered .
Children
Now 's report revealed that women accounted for just 16 per cent of playable human characters in the 10 most popular games of 2000 .
It also reported that 58 per cent of playable male characters were white , but that if they had excluded sports games the proportion would have been much higher .
" Video games do seem to do worse than other mediums , particularly when it comes to the representation of women , " said Patti Miller , director of the charity 's children and the media program .
" The lack of racial diversity in video games seems to be on a similar level to that of U.S. TV . "
It was n't just a matter of ignoring women and black people .
A few Japanese games had descended into racist stereotyping of black people , partly because the country 's more homogenous racial make - up meant such racism was rarely confronted .
For example , the 1989 role - playing game Square 's Tom Sawyer , based -- somewhat ironically -- on the Mark Twain 's novel The Adventures of Tom Sawyer , portrayed black characters as blackface - style caricatures with giant lips .
It was never released outside Japan .
Many Japanese games did , however , seek to avoid portrayals of race altogether , through the use of " mukokuseki " characters that are drawn in such a way to obscure their racial origin , so that while they could viewed as white or Asian , but were neither .
In the West the racism in video games was more subtle and behind - closed - doors , with some game publishers pushing designers to " whiten " the skin tone of black characters or remove them entirely .
" It all boils down to money , " Shahid Ahmad , a British Asian game developer , told Edge magazine in 2002 .
" Publishers believe that games with black or Asian characters could lose them money , although they wo n't openly say it . "
Homosexuality , meanwhile , remained largely taboo in video games throughout the 1980s beyond Japan 's yaoi , or boys ' love , titles .
The few that did mention the subject usually did so in a negative way .
It took until the 1995 adventure game The Orion Conspiracy for the subject to be tackled in a less prejudiced way .
Created by UK developer Divide by Zero and published by Domark , The Orion Conspiracy cast the player as a father who travels to a space station to investigate the death of his son .
While searching for the truth , it emerges that the son was gay .
" When I first read the script I was quite surprised , " said " Tardie " , an artist who worked on the game .
" It was a very daring thing for Domark to do .
The gay character was embedded into the game and you found out about it as you questioned people and discovered more about your son .
It got quite charged as the father did not know , so you got to see how he handled it . "
The real battle in the Senate on the day of the hearing , however , was not between the proponents and opponents of restrictions on video games but between Sega and Nintendo .
It did not take long for the bitterness between the two video game giants to bubble to the surface and soon Washington 's finest were watching Nintendo of America chairman Howard Lincoln and Sega of America vice - president Bill White Jr. engaged in their own verbal equivalent of Mortal Kombat .
Lincoln used Nintendo's earlier decision to force Acclaim to remove the gore from the Super NES version of Mortal Kombat as a stick to beat its commercial rival with .
He said Nintendo had lost money by sanitizing its version of Mortal Kombat and had even received angry letters and telephone calls from children demanding the violence before proudly adding that Night Trap would " never appear on a Nintendo system " , ignoring how the lack of a CD drive meant the Super NES was technologically incapable of handling such a game .
White countered that Sega had an older audience demographic to Nintendo , a claim echoing the underlying message of his company 's " Sega does what Nintendon 't " advertising campaign : Sega is for cool teens , Nintendo is for children .
He added that Sega had already introduced age ratings on its games voluntarily and that it wanted other companies to adopt its system .
Lincoln stuck the knife in .
He dismissed Sega 's age ratings system as a panic measure introduced when the controversy about Night Trap started and refuted White 's assertions that the video game industry was now catering for adults rather than children .
White started listing the violent games available on the Super NES and showed the Senators a Nintendo light gun .
Lincoln described Night Trap as " outrageous " .
White defended it by pointing out that the player has to try and stop the vampires only to get slapped down by Lieberman who interjected : " You 're going to have to go a long way to convince me that that game has any moral value . "
Lieberman watched the pair tearing chunks out of each other with amazement .
Nintendo and Sega were n't the only people in the games business divided by the controversy .
The game developers who worked on Mortal Kombat and Night Trap were also divided over how to react to the row their creations had started .
" I felt like we were being attacked by a bunch of people who were mostly ignorant of what they were attacking , " said Tobias .
" Watching the news coverage at the time , you 'd think that Mortal Kombat was created by some evil corporation .
Anyone who knew me or Ed personally knew that our intentions were n't anything other than ensuring our players were having fun . "
Night Trap
Rob Fulop , who had designed Night Trap while it was still part of Hasbro 's NEMO project , found the experience harder .
" The scandal was kind of silly and it was also deeply embarrassing because friends of mine , my parents , and my girlfriend did n't really get games .
All they knew was a game that I had made was on TV and Captain Kangaroo said it was bad for kids , " he said .
" I fell out with my girlfriend because I thought it was completely bullshit . "
But while he thought the inquiry was nonsense , after nearly 15 years of game making , Fulop had begun to worry about the message video games were sending out to children .
" I grew up in a generation where you watched TV , that 's all we did .
TV was basically 30 - minute stories and always had a happy ending .
Whatever the problem , in half an hour the problem was worked out , " said Fulop .
" You tell that story to kids 20 million times and they grow up believing everything will work out .
That was my generation .
You believed everything would work out because of TV .
Now think of video games -- the message is no matter what you do you always lose .
You never ever , ever , ever , ever win .
Once in a million you win , but most of the time you never win .
Unless you can find the cheat , so what does that teach you ?
I think that 's created a whole different culture -- a very fatalistic ' what 's the point ? ' attitude .
It 's a personal philosophy , I do n't know if it 's true or not . "
The controversy surrounding Night Trap and the reaction of his family and friends inspired Fulop 's next game : " I decided that the next game I made was going to be so cute and so adorable that no - one could ever , ever say it was bad for kids .
It was sar­castic .
It was like what 's the cutest thing I could make ?
What 's the most sissy game I could turn out ? "
A shopping mall Santa Claus gave him the answer .
" I would go at the end of the year to see Santa Claus at the stores and he would tell me exactly what kids wanted , " said Fulop .
" He knows better than anyone because his job all day is to ask them what they want .
You want to know what 's going to sell , go talk to Santa .
I did that every year .
I went that year and he said the same thing that was popular every year was a puppy and has been for the last 50 years . "
Fulop 's plan to make an adorable game and children 's Christmas wishes for puppies came together to form 1995 's Dogz : Your Computer Pet , one of the first virtual pet games . [ 3 ]
Dogz installed an enthusiastic cartoon puppy on the player 's computer that was housed within a playpen window but could be stroked or taught to do tricks .
Fulop 's goal was to make players grow attached to their virtual puppy : " The dogs follow your mouse and they can't wait to be petted , you do a mouse click and they come running over , it was their biggest excitement .
" People get attached to pets because they need you .
You 're needed .
You come home and this thing is in your face ... if you 're not there you know it 's going to be very unhappy or it could die .
I do n't think a virtual pet is any different . "
Fulop 's company PF Magic played on this attachment to encourage sales of the game .
" It was sold the same way real puppies are sold , " said Fulop .
" We 'll give it to you for 10 days and then ask for it back .
You give a puppy to a kid and ask for it back five days later -- see what he says .
In sales this is called the ' puppy dog close ' .
" We gave you five days ' worth of food and after five days you ran out of food and if you want more food you 've got to call us and give us $ 20 and we 'll give you a lifetime 's supply of food , otherwise your puppy dies or you have to delete it .
And who can delete it ?
It 's cruel , it 's a little puppy and you wo n't feed it . "
Fulop 's ploy worked like a dream and Dogz became a huge success , eventually becoming the starting point of the long - running Petz series of virtual pets .

With evidence about the relationship between video game violence and real - life behavior inconclusive , the senators closed the hearing by telling the video game industry to return to Washington on 4th March 1994 to report on its progress with creating an age rating system . [ 4 ]
In the three months between the hearings and the industry 's return to the Senate , the U.S. video game industry reorganized itself .
The country 's leading game companies quit the Software Publishers Association and formed the Interactive Digital Software Association headed by veteran Washington lobbyist Douglas Lowenstein .
After several weeks of rows , the industry also created the Entertainment Software Rating Board ( ESRB ) .
The ESRB 's job was to manage the industry 's new age - ratings system .
Sega also stopped distributing the Sega CD version of Night Trap in January , although America 's leading toy stores Toys R Us and Kay - Bee Toys had already stopped stocking it because of the Senate hearings . [ 5 ]
The changes were enough to satisfy the Senate .
The controversy was laid to rest and Lieberman and Kohl 's threats of creating a state - run regulator with it .
The game industry came out of the controversy with more than just a lesson in how to handle politicians .
It had also learned that violence and controversy sells .
Sales of Mortal Kombat and Night Trap soared during the hearings .
Night Trap in particular had gone from a poorly selling Sega CD title to a game that was selling 50,000 copies a week at the height of the row .
When Zito's Digital Pictures released Night Trap on the PC to coincide Halloween 1994 , its advertising campaign embraced the scandal : " Some members of Congress tried to ban Night Trap for being sexist and offensive to women ( Hey .
They ought to know ) . "
Arcade game maker Strata , which also got a ticking off in the hearings , stuck its middle finger up to Washington within months of the hearings by launching BloodStorm , a Mortal Kombat clone featuring even more extreme violence and a hidden character that had Lieberman 's head so players could beat up the Democrat Senator .
Lieberman 's attempt to challenge video game violence failed .
If anything the changes that resulted from his intervention made video game violence more acceptable , as the age ratings system would identify violent or controversial games as for adults , not children , helping game publishers defend themselves against future accusations of peddling violence to children .
And with an age ratings system in place Nintendo no longer felt compelled to filter out the violence from games released on its consoles .
When Acclaim launched Mortal Kombat II on the Super NES , the fatalities and blood remained in place .
" The inquiry did n't impact anything , " said Tobias .
" We were content with the M for mature on our packaging .
Developers and publishers fell in line , accepted the ratings system and developed games according to the need of the product . "
The Senate hearings had actually made it safer for video game developers to create violent games , not harder .

Bandai 's portable virtual pet the Tamagotchi came out shortly after Dogz in 1996 .
Created by Aki Maita , the electronic toy became a global sensation similar in scale to the Rubik 's Cube .
Tens of millions were sold worldwide .
[ 4 ]
The evidence is still inconclusive .
As Bryon 's 2008 report for the UK government noted : " It would not be accurate to say that there is no evidence of harm but , equally , it is not appropriate to conclude that there is evidence of no harm . "
She added : " The research evidence for the beneficial effects of games is no more convincing than the work on harmful effects . "

The bigger selling Mortal Kombat , however , remained on sale .

Seven months after Google launched its first phone , the HTC - designed Nexus One , it has stopped selling the devices through its online store .
" Sorry , folks ... The Nexus One is no longer available for purchase directly from Google , " the company announced .
Google had warned users about this in May , saying it planned to wind down its web store .
Those who still want to buy a Nexus One will now have to go through Vodafone but that 's limited to some parts of Europe .
Google promises it will make the device available to " registered developers " through a partner .
The Nexus One launched with what seemed like an innovative idea in the retailing of phones .
Instead of being sold through stores , Google would directly sell it through the web to customers –something that worked for other consumer electronics products .
However , the strategy did n’t resonate with consumers .
Potential customers found they could n’t find a Nexus One in the real - world to play with , unless they knew a friend who already had the device .
Google 's customer service support for the device also left many users unhappy .
Google has acknowledged that its retailing model with the Nexus One failed to catch on with consumers .
" While the global adoption of the Android platform has exceeded our expectations , the web store has not , " wrote Andy Rubin , vice - president of engineering and Android czar at Google in a blog post in May .
" It ’s remained a niche channel for early adopters . "
At the same time , Google tried to put the devices into retail stores in U.S. I wireless , a T - mobile affiliate , got Nexus One at its 250 stores mostly in the Midwest .
So far , it has n't announced any other retail partnerships .
So is the Nexus One dead or is the Nexus One web retail experiment over ?
The answer to that will depend on whether Google will take the risk to launch a successor to the phone or if it will be content to let other handset makers take Android forward .

Intense competition for graduate jobs means that more than three quarters of employers require at least a 2:1 degree grade , a survey suggests .
The Association of Graduate Recruiters says there are more graduates chasing fewer jobs - with vacancies down by 7 % .
Applications have soared , with an average of 69 people chasing each graduate job .
In response , 78 % of employers are now filtering out applicants who have not achieved a 2:1 degree .
About two thirds of students achieve either a first class degree or a 2:1 - so this means the remaining third , who will still have passed their exams and paid their tuition fees , will not even be considered by these employers .
" While this approach does aid the sifting process it can rule out promising candidates with the right work skills unnecessarily , " says the AGR 's chief executive , Carl Gilleard .
" We are encouraging our members to look beyond the degree classification when narrowing down the field of candidates to manageable proportions . "
Missing the cut off
The most recent figures - for 2008 - 09 - show that 64 % of students achieved either a first class or upper second degree .
But there are substantial differences within this average .
For instance , men are less likely than women to achieve these higher grades and part - time students are less likely to do so than full - time ones .
When these factors are combined , less than half of male part - time students achieve a 2:1 - with this survey suggesting that many will now struggle in the jobs market .
Seventy percent of business leaders fear that inadequate staff skills are the greatest threat to their ability to capitalise on the recovery Douglas Fraser , BBC Scotland business editor Analysis :
Higher skills , but for what jobs ?
Degree classification was more widely used as a selection criterion than relevant work experience ( 34 % ) or degree subject ( 33 % ) or going to a particular university ( 7 % ) .
This annual survey provides a snapshot of the graduate jobs market , based on the experiences of almost 200 leading employers .
It shows that a growing number of graduates are competing for a shrinking number of vacancies .
This has been intensified by graduates from last year still looking for jobs and adding to the pressure on vacancies .
This was the second year of falls in graduate vacancies - and the average number of applicants per vacancy has risen from 49 to 69 .
Starting salaries remain at £ 25,000 .
This AGR survey , carried out twice a year , concludes that the recovery is " going to be slower than previously thought " .
Conflicting signals
This is the third survey of the graduate jobs market in a week - and taken together they show uncertainty over whether there is a fragile recovery or a continuing decline .
Have Your Say
As someone with both university lecturer and industry experience , I would probably not hire a graduate with a grade below 2:1 Mustafa Yorumcu Send us your comments
The hunters and the hunted
The AGR survey suggests that opportunities for university leavers are getting worse .
The current average of 69 applicants for a job contrasts with only 28 in 2006 .
But last week , another survey of the graduate jobs market , from High Fliers , found a mixed picture - with a resurgence in vacancies in banking and finance and a decline in vacancies in the public sector .
At the weekend , research from the Higher Education Policy Institute showed that graduate unemployment had risen from 11.1 % to 14 % - but that it was male graduates in particular who were failing to find jobs .
And the stiff competition for young people starts long before embarking on a degree course , with the high number of sixth formers achieving high grades making the fight for a university place even tougher .
Research commissioned by ACS International Schools suggests university admissions officers are struggling to identify the best students because of " inflated " A - level grades .
The survey of 40 UK admissions officers and 20 from the United States found 53 % thought " grade inflation " made spotting the best candidates harder .
Last year , more than one in four A - level exam entries ( 26.7 % ) were awarded an A grade .
' Savage cuts '
Concerns about a tough jobs market for graduates comes as a review considers whether universities should be allowed to charge higher tuition fees .
Aaron Porter , president of the National Union of Students , warned that spending cuts could cause even greater difficulties for university leavers .
" We are concerned that the savage cuts to the public sector will create further unemployment , and will make the lives of graduates tougher in an already difficult jobs market , " he said .
David Willetts , Minister for Universities and Skills , said : " The job market remains challenging for new graduates , as it does for others .
But a degree is still a good investment in the long term , and graduates have a key role to play in helping Britain out of the recession . "
Graduates from across the UK have been sharing their experiences with BBC Online .
Here is a selection of their comments .
I have recently graduated with a 2:1 but I have been unable to apply for the majority of graduate schemes as employers are demanding high A - Level results .
I feel that this is unfair .
Jessica McKinven , Doncaster , England
I graduated last year with a first class masters degree in civil and structural engineering from the University of Liverpool .
Following graduation I decided to take a gap year and spent the winter working in a ski resort in France .
Having returned from France , I found the graduate job market in a far worse state than when I left .
This is a terrible time to be a graduate .
If the situation does not change for the better soon , I will be looking for greener pastures abroad .
Marc Atherton , Warrington , England
Considering the domestic economic climate , the amount of students now going to university in the UK and the increasing emergence of a global labour market , it is not surprising that employers are demanding more and more from graduates .
I have decided to move to China on completion of my masters in September , gain industry experience ( where there are opportunities ) and learn Mandarin to further differentiate my CV from my competitors .
James , Welwyn Garden City , England
It 's bad for graduates in the UK but it 's even worse for international students .
It is next to impossible to find a job after spending close to £ 50,000 on a degree - there 's always a problem with getting a job with a post study work visa .
I am ashamed to say that I was fooled into coming to England to progress in life and like many other educated people I am fleeing this country for better opportunities .
Malintha Delpachitra , Southampton , Hampshire , England
I graduated with a 2:2 but this was partly due to a dissertation problem , based on all other results I would have achieved a 2:1 .
Now , a year on after graduating , I 'm still looking for a job .
I have to rule out most jobs I look at due to the 2:1 requirement .
I have six years management experience as well as my degree but apparently I 'm unsuitable because of my 2:2 .
Paul Donnelly , Glasgow , Scotland
I graduated with a BSc ( Hons ) 2:2 and went on to do an MSc at Imperial College from which I graduated with distinction .
This was still not enough to be considered for many research posts and jobs .
Elena , London , England
As a 2009 graduate I have found that the graduate job market is practically closed to anyone other than those already working in the same or similar roles as those available .
However , on the plus side , Britain has an extremely well educated customer service and retail industry !
Bern , Coventry , England
What 's so bad with doing well at university ?
I know I strive to get a first .
If you are paying for your fees like you do in England , you should be putting in the effort .
Thankfully I do not have to pay my tuition fees , but I still put in a lot of effort .
If the students are not achieving at university , how can employers expect them to perform well ?
Amy , Scotland
As a university careers adviser , I try to help students and graduates understand the full range of opportunities they can consider .
Management training schemes are great opportunities for graduates , but not everybody wants or is suited to a life in the corporate world .
Let 's not forget the thousands of small and medium - sized employers across all industries and sectors .
Alexandra Hemingway , Guildford , England
A warning for graduates thinking that they can wait until we 're out of the recession before looking for a graduate job .
When I was looking for jobs a few years ago , I found that many employers would automatically reject graduate scheme applicants who had been out of university for more than three years .
Rachel B , Leeds , England
Picking a tough course at a tough university was foolish and not worth the risk .
The vast majority of graduate jobs have told me not to bother applying unless I have a 2:1 .
Knowing this now , I would have gone to a mediocre University and studied a far less challenging degree .
Alex Jones , Cardiff , Wales
JUNE 17 -- A shipment of dozens of human heads was intercepted last week at an Arkansas airport after a Southwest Airlines worker flagged three " rubber tote containers " holding the human remains .
According to this Little Rock Police Department report , the containers were brought last Wednesday night to a Southwest cargo office by Alan Woods , a 25 - year - old deliveryman .
Since " the containers were not marked " as to what was " inside , Southwest employee Randy Stroud , 51 , advised Woods that Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration regulations covering biohazard material required him to " see what was in the containers . "
Upon inspection of the first container , Stroud discovered " a large red Bio Hazard bag ... with several items wrapped in large absorbent pads . "
When Stroud realized the items were human heads , he called airport police .
The human remains were bound for the Fort Worth , Texas office of Medtronics , a medical research firm .
The heads were later turned over by cops to the Pulaski County Coroner 's Office , which is now examining the shipment of the remains , which were picked up by Woods at a private home in Conway .
The coroner is investigating the source of the heads .

Yesterday , we reported on the curious disappearance of a WCBS report that military spy planes had been used to capture the Times Square bomber .
Why was this story scrubbed ?
We have the answer .
Sort of .
The original WCBStv.com article , " Army Intelligence Planes Led to Suspect 's Arrest , " by Marcia Kramer , read :
In the end , it was secret Army intelligence planes that did him in .
Armed with his cell phone number , they circled the skies over the New York area , intercepting a call to Emirates Airlines reservations , before scrambling to catch him at John F. Kennedy International Airport .
Then , a few minutes after we wrote about it , the article was rewritten with no mention of spy planes , and no indication it had been updated .
Spooky !
We asked WCBS what happened , and a spokesman responded :
The story that was broadcast by WCBS - TV did not include any mention of a military plane , although the station did have unconfirmed information about the use of a plane that we looked into but were unable to confirm .
A line about the use of military aircraft was inadvertently included in the story that appeared on the station 's Web site but was removed .
According to WCBS , they simply got caught up in the frenzy of breaking news and " inadvertently " put in an unconfirmed detail .
There is a problem with this account :
The detail about the Army intelligence planes was featured prominently in the title of the originally article .
Clearly , the line was n't " inadvertently included " — it was put in and deliberately promoted .
After all , it was the most eye - catching detail of the story .
Since then , no other news organizations have reported that Army spy planes helped capture Faisal Shahzad .
( Though few blogs speculated on the WCBS report , and its disappearance . )
The New York Times reports that what ultimately led to Shahzad 's capture was the crew of the Emirates flight he was on sending a passenger list to customs officials before takeoff .
They discovered Shahzad had been put on a no - fly list as a result of the FBI 's investigation .
Authorities were then able to keep the plane from taking off and dragged Shahzad off it .
But that does n't necessarily rule out the possibility that Army Special Ops — or their planes — were involved .
The Nation points out the two guys running the investigation have deep backgrounds in secret Pentagon " Special Access Programs . "
( In certain cases dealing with terrorism and WMDs , military Special Ops forces are allowed to act on U.S. soil .
See : PowerGeyser )
At some point in their investigation , the FBI began following Shahzad , then lost him until he turned up on the Emirates passenger list .
It 's possible that the planes were used during this time to try to find him .
Although the original WCBS account , that planes " intercepted a call to Emirates " does n't fit with the New York Times ' report that authorities did n't know Shahzad was on the flight until that last - minute customs cross-check .
So , why did WCBS scrub the intelligence planes detail ?
Two possibilities : 1 ) They made the bad call to promote flimsy reporting , and when their story started getting picked up by blogs ( Drudge also picked up their story ) they realized it would n't be able to stand up to widespread scrutiny .
So they quietly backed away .
2 ) They were very confident about the spy planes detail — which is why the put it in the headline — but someone made them remove it because it was super secret information .
When the WCBS spokesperson emailed us , there was some sort of Jason Bourne - like character standing behind him with a silenced pistol softly telling him to , " Do what 's best for your country ... "
Again , they quietly backed away .
Honestly , the first possibility is probably the likeliest .
But the second possibility is way cooler .
So , let 's just say Jason Bourne caught Faisal Shahzad .
Update : Maybe it was actually a drone ?
Over at Pajamas Media , Annie Jacobs spoke with a retired NSA source , who told her this :
A retired National Security Agency ( NSA ) source , speaking on the condition of anonymity , says signals intelligence was a key factor in catching Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad .
Working with the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force , NSA agents apparently tracked Shahzad 's movements by locating signals from his cell phone , possibly via a drone .
Jacobs notes that a spy plane would violate the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act , which limits military operations on American soil .
But a drone might not be covered ; apparently , DHS and coastguard have in the past expressed interest in using drones in civilian operations .
The thing about cannabis is that it sharpens your perception of whatever you put your attention on : food , music , sex , dancing , etc .
You were putting your attention on your thoughts .
And those thoughts turned into a negative spiral .
Now , I 'm going to say something here which may be something that you have not heard before , but I have found very useful when dealing with negative thoughts .
And that is this : just because the thoughts are there in my head , does not mean that they have anything to do with what I really am .
I remember that there is someone who is observing the thoughts , and that someone is me .
I am not my thoughts .
I am the observer of my thoughts .
This observer never changes , is pure consciousness , and is always free and perfect .
But I tend to identify with my thoughts ( as I identify with my body ) .
I want to protect my body from perceived threats : political , social , physical .
And as a result I will try to develop strategies to " save myself . "
In fact , I am just trying to save my body , which is a hopeless task , as the body is just born to die .
BUT : I am not my body .
I am that which observes my body .
So , my advice to you is to turn your attention away from the content of your thoughts , which , after all is just a set of stories that you are telling yourself , and instead , put your attention on the one who is telling the stories .
Your Self .
This sense of I AM , this observer , is always the same , has always been the same ( at the age of three , fifteen , twenty -- and will be the same at forty , fifty - six and ninety ) .
You can not describe this observer Self , because it is pure awareness .
You can only describe it as not being this or that .
You are nothing that you can conceive of or perceive .
And this pure awareness can never be hurt , can never be sick , can never die .
This awareness is who you really are .
Trust me .
Put your attention on that awareness .
Whenever you have a negative thought , or worry , ask yourself :
Who is having this thought ?
How is this ' awareness ' going to be affected ?
Remember , every night you go to sleep , you are willing and happy to let go of your stories , and your thoughts .
And in the morning you wake refreshed .
You can find that same refreshment , by letting go of your thoughts and stories during the day .
Notice them , yes , and then immediately turn your attention to the one who is observing the thoughts -- to the awareness behind the thoughts .
You will be amazed at the results .
Best of luck to you , my friend .
In a provocative move the ­Iranian Red Crescent was this weekend due to send two vessels packed with food and medical aid and 70 relief workers .
A third ship , carrying an operating theatre , could follow .
President Ahmadinejad raised the spectre of a sea battle as he warned the ships would be carrying an escort of “ volunteer marines ” ready to “ teach Israelis a lesson ” .
Ali Shirazi , the Revolutionary Guard ’s spokesman for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , said it was “ Iran ’s duty to defend the innocent people of Gaza ” .
Foreign Secretary William
Hague described the intervention as “ unhelpful ” .
The blockade has been in place since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2006 despite inter­national concern about a humanitarian crisis .
That concern turned to condemnation on May 31 when , in a raid on a Turkish aid flotilla , nine people were killed by Israeli commandos .
The formerly obscure measure of unemployment known as U6 has garnered a lot of attention this recession .
This data , from the Bureau of Labor Statistics , counts the conventionally unemployed ( those able to work , available to work , not working at all , and who have looked for a job in the last four weeks ) plus those working part time but preferring full - time work , discouraged job seekers who have n't actively looked for a job recently , and people who want a job but went back to school or took on family obligations , making them unavailable for work .
While conventionally measured unemployment peaked at just over 10 % , the U6 unemployment rate peaked at well over 17 % .
( Both measures were modestly off their highs at 9.7 % and 16.6 % , respectively , in May . )
Some pundits have used this much higher number as an indicator that we are rapidly approaching the 25 % unemployment rate of the Great Depression .
Others seem to imply that the U6 number is the real unemployment number and the conventional unemployment number is a smoke screen to hide how bad things really are .
A recent Wall Street Journal editorial ( the full article may not be readable without a subscription ) indicated that a lot of the interest in the U6 statistic might be more political than economic , concluding that those on the far right and far left are trying to use the ugly U6 data to score political points .
I strongly disagree .
The U6 number just adds a level of complication to the already difficult - to - interpret unemployment indicator .
Furthermore , it appears to me that the U6 takes an already badly lagging economic indicator and puts it even further behind the eight ball .
Claim : Attorney ’s essay challenges the constitutionality of health care reform legislation .
OUTDATED
Example : [ Connelly , August 2009 ]
The Truth About the Health Care Bills
Well , I have done it !
I have read the entire text of proposed House Bill 3200 : The Affordable Health Care Choices Act of 2009 .
I studied it with particular emphasis from my area of expertise , constitutional law .
I was frankly concerned that parts of the proposed law that were being discussed might be unconstitutional .
What I found was far worse than what I had heard or expected .
To begin with , much of what has been said about the law and its implications is in fact true , despite what the Democrats and the media are saying .
The law does provide for rationing of health care , particularly where senior citizens and other classes of citizens are involved , free health care for illegal immigrants , free abortion services , and probably forced participation in abortions by members of the medical profession .
The Bill will also eventually force private insurance companies out of business and put everyone into a government run system .
All decisions about personal health care will ultimately be made by federal bureaucrats and most of them will not be health care professionals .
Hospital admissions , payments to physicians , and allocations of necessary medical devices will be strictly controlled .
However , as scary as all of that it , it just scratches the surface .
In fact , I have concluded that this legislation really has no intention of providing affordable health care choices .
Instead it is a convenient cover for the most massive transfer of power to the Executive Branch of government that has ever occurred , or even been contemplated .
If this law or a similar one is adopted , major portions of the Constitution of the United States will effectively have been destroyed .

Ever since George Romero ’s Night of the Living Dead ambushed cinemas back in 1968 , zombies have gradually crept to the top of the heap …
For the latest free agent scoops follow me on twitter at www.twitter.com/andystricklandExpect an official announcement from the Dallas Stars tomorrow announcing the signing of forward Krys Barch .
Look for Barch to sign a 2 yr. deal good for $ 825,000 in 2010 - 2011 and $ 850,000 the following year .
This is a good move by Dallas as Barch is considered among his peers to be one of the toughest and guttiest players in the NHL .
This signing along with the two - year deal Shawn Thornton signed with Boston should set the market for guys like Cam Janssen in St. Louis who is seeking an extension from the Blues .
Despite some interesting speculation , Bruins goaltender Tim Thomas is not actively seeking a trade .
Right now I 'm told things remain status quo for Thomas who would consider accepting a trade but on the other hand is n't afraid to say no if it's to a city he has no interest in moving to .
The idea that his agent is calling teams in an effort to facilitate a trade is not happening .
If there is a team out there interested in Tim Thomas 's services would n't they just pick up the phone and call Bruins GM Peter Chiarelli ?
Is the agent supposed to decide what players Boston receives in return as well ?
Agents do n't work deals , General Manager 's do and no agent wants to be caught in the middle trying to orchestrate deals .
So if the Bruins trade Thomas it 's going to be because Chiarelli found a taker and Thomas elected to waive his no - trade clause .
In a way the Thomas story has painted him as a player seeking a trade when this is n't the case .
You can expect Washington forward Tomas Fleischmann to file for salary arbitration by Monday 's deadline .
Because he 's set to become an unrestricted free agent after this season he can only be awarded a one year deal .
Blues forward Cam Janssen is expected to also file for arbitration if no deal between he and the Blues is reached over the weekend .
The Blues and the agent for D-man Erik Johnson have had very mild discussions .
No real negotiations have begun at this point .
I will be mildly shocked if he signs more than a two - year deal .
Signing a one year contract may not serve in his best interest either .
Would he want the pressure of playing under a one - year deal ?
Not suggesting he could n't handle it but getting a two - year contract would allow him to settle in and take his game to the necessary level to cash in a couple of years down the road .
Same goes with David Perron .
As I 've written numerous times , I 'm not sure the Blues are prepared to commit long - term dollars just yet .
GM Doug Armstrong likely needs more time to fully know exactly who he has in David Perron .
Is he a perennial 30 goal scorer or a 15 - 25 goal scorer ?
This should n't be considered a bad thing at all , if he continues to develop and take the strides he 's shown since he ’s entered the league then he 'll be properly rewarded at the end of the day .
Expect Alex
Seen to sign a deal in the range of three years in the neighborhood of $ 3 million a year .
Are the Blues considering changing Captains heading into this season ?
Do n't be completely surprised if this were to happen .
Other teams have done so in recent years with superstar players such as Partick Marleau and Mike Modano .
It did n't seem to affect things too much in San Jose or Dallas especially with the Sharks who went on to finish another season with over 100 points .
In no way am I suggesting Eric Brewer is a bad Captain and can no longer fulfill the role that come with wearing the C .
I do think it 's time for a new crop of players to step up and take on more responsibility though .
A changing of the guard in a way might be a positive thing with a New Head Coach and GM in place .
With Paul Kariya and Keith Tkachuk no longer inside the dressing room , now appears to be the perfect time to transition into a new era .
I 'm sure Barret Jackman would be given serious consideration but I think it 's safe to say David Backes would be the logical choice when / if this happens .
The Blues have a lot of repsect for Eric Brewer and any change in my opinion would n't reflect negatively on him as much as it's the right time to move forward with a younger player .
If the Blues did n't have a candidate there would be no reason to make a change .
Earlier story ... You can pretty much rule out more than half the teams in the NHL when talking about trading for Jason Spezza .
How many teams can afford to take on a player with an AAV of $ 7 million for the next five years ?
His no -trade clause kicks in on July first which is also the same day he 's due a $ 4 million bonus .
One team I can confirm that has had conversations with Ottawa is the Calgary Flames .
It appears every player on the Florida Panthers roster is on the trade table outside of goaltender Tomas Vokoun but I would n't assume Stephen Weiss is on the move either .
Weiss has a no - trade clause and has not been asked to accept a trade by Panthers GM Dale Tallon .
The San Jose Sharks are working to get forward Manny Malhotra re-signed before he 's set to become an unrestricted free agent on July 1st .
He would like to remain with San Jose .
There is a good chance Tampa Bay re-signs RFA Steve Downey this week .
The members of Hockey Canada are in Edmonton today for a ceremony in which they will recieve their rings for winning the Gold medal in the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver .
Blues GM Doug Armstrong is on hand for the ceremony .
It 's doubtful D-man and RFA Marc Staal signs an extension with the Rangers before July first as he 'll likely wait to see if an offersheet comes his way .
Nice to hear Sidney Crosby has bought a house of his own and has moved out of the Mario Lemieux quarters .
Newly acquired Blues forward Vladimir Sobotka will likely come to St. Louis to have his recently repaired shoulder looked at by Blues Doctors .
I 'm told his re-hab is going smoothly and there 's no reason to assume he wo n't be ready for trading camp .
Sobotka asked the Bruins for a trade as he was looking for an opportunity to play a bigger role .
The Blues have told him he projects to be on the roster when the season begins .
He 's looking to sign a one - way contractWhen Blues assistant GM Jarmo Kekalainen arrived in Los Angeles early in the week he told Doug Armstrong he thought he could land both Jaden Schwartz and Vladimir Tarasenko .
Well he did .
The Blues left the Staples Center Friday night with two players they had rated number seven and eight respectively on their final draft list .
Not many teams are able to leave a draft with two players rated in their top ten in their back pocket .
Speaking to an independent amateur scout he tells me the Blues got the steal of the draft in Tarasenko who the Blues took with the 16thth overall selection .
The Blues did a nice job of moving 2009 first round pick D-man David Rundblad to make it happen .
It ’s good to see Rundblad maintained his value over the last year especially after a subpar World Junior Tournament .
Following Sweden ’s game against the Americans multiple members of the Blues organization were n’t exactly handing out compliments regarding Rundblad ’s performance .
When asked about his play a high ranking Blues official responded “ I did n’t really watch him , I was more focused on the American kids ” .
It takes just a tad of common sense to read between the lines there .
I find it hard to believe a member of the Blues was n’t watching their first round pick play in arguably the biggest game of the kid ’s career .
In fairness Rundblad rebounded nicely when he returned to the Swedish Elite League as he put together a strong finish to the season that nearly earned him a spot on the men ’s National Team for the World Championships .
In the minds of the Ottawa Senators Rundbald ’s value did n’t diminish over the last 12 months as they traded away their 16th pick this year in exchange for the 17th pick a year ago .
Kekalainen is being realistic when suggesting there ’s no way Tarasenko would be available at 16 if he were a Canadian .
We all know teams are weary of Russian born players nowadays and as an organization you do need to do your homework before taking one of these kids .
I do feel some teams are a little too scared which can be puzzling considering the NHL is loaded with Russian superstars .
This was pretty much created by Alexander Radulov who broke his contract with Nashville to return home a few years ago .
The Radulov situation has impacted and rattled just about every NHL team .
There are a lot more Ovechkin and Malkin ’s who stay than there are Radulov’s .
It all comes down to who the player is .
If you are innovative in your questioning during the interview process you can gather a decent amount of information about a player .
I do n’t care if you ’re North American or European , there is always a risk when signing a player .
How many North American players have signed big money deals and tanked ?
St. Louis and New Jersey are a few teams that do a nice job with their secondary testing at the draft which places a player in a much more relaxed setting .
Here ’s a tip to NHL clubs , do n’t draft a Russian to be a third line player .
They can turn around and be a top six guy and make more money over in the KHL .
It ’s understandable why a Russian would rather play in their home country where they ’re more comfortable especially if it means they play a bigger role with their team and can make more cash .
North America is n’t for every Russian player as some guys are just culturally out of place over here .
Russians have a choice when they come over , like Ovechkin they can make an effort to embrace the language and the culture or they can stay in Russia where they do n’t have to adjust .
One thing that never makes sense to me is why an NHL team would expect a Russian player to come over and play in the AHL .
Why would a Russian player ever want to slug it out in the AHL when they can make more money in the KHL ?
Does an AHL team really need a Russian player in the minors anyway ?
I find very little reason to bring one of these guys over before they are ready to step right into the NHL .
Tarasenko convinced the Blues that it ’s “ his dream to play in the NHL ” and they have no reason not to believe he wants to come over .
In fact , after celebrating with his family in the stands , Tarasenko told the Blues staff “ This is the most beautiful day of my life ” when he reached the stage .
The Blues and Tarasenko struck a chord during the interview process as his bubbly , outspoken personality exudes confidence and an excitement for life .
The Blues were careful before making this selection as there ’s always some level of risk when taking Russian .
Collecting an additional first rounder gave the club an opportunity to take a chance .
It makes sense to assume he would have been gone at 16 if he was North American , if he were from Canada or the U.S. it ’s likely the Blues would have taken him ahead of Schwartz as well .
Tarasenko has been competing in a men ’s league that is far superior to the USHL and already has a man ’s body at 210 pounds .
Not to mention he ’s closer than Schwartz to playing in the NHL .
How Close ?
Tarasenko will return to Russia next season and has two years left on his existing contract .
There was an agreement in place to allow him to leave for the NHL after the 2010 - 2011 season but that was with a previous General Manger who was recently replaced .
There was some talk about his Father being replaced as the Head Coach but I ’m being told it looks like he ’ll stay .
Having his dad as the head coach could make things somewhat interesting in a year or two down the roadl .
There is believed to be a buyout in his contract that would allow the player to pay his way out of any binding contract .
No NHL team is allowed to pay a KHL team to get a player out of a contract .
At the end of the day Tarasenko will come over at the age of 20 at the very latest .
The Blues told him they ’re more concerned with him being part of the organization for the next 15 years and want him to come over when he ’s ready .
It ’s incredibly crucial that the Blues and the player start heir relationship off on the right foot and in this case they certainly have .
I would be careful with some of the comparisons being tossed around .
Does he have a chance to be a special player ?
Yes he does , but he ’s not Ovechkin or Malkin .
He is a beast or in this case a “ Russian Tank ” at 210 pounds with only 10 % body fat .
He ’s not your stereotypical Russian either as he ’s the type of player who ’ll get in your face if necessary .
He once got absolutely destroyed by an American during a tournament and like Ovechkin got right up and went after the kid .
Speaking to numerous scouts in Los Angeles most tell me Tarasenko is hands down the third best forward in the draft behind Taylor Hall and Tyler Seguin .
How many draft picks have already played games with the men ’s National team ?
The Blues certainly had him rated higher than Jeff Skinner who went seventh overall to Carolina .
They may not have had him ahead of Ryan Johansen who is a prototypical Canadian center who went 4th overall to Columbus .
Regardless Tarasenko is considered a top five talent in the 2010 draft .
Los Angeles , Atlanta , New York Rangers , and Pittsbugh all believed to be interested in taking Tarasenko with the Penguins aggressively trying to trade up and get him .
I do n’t think there are many teams all that eager to help Pittsburgh become even better .
Rink Rats !
New Jersey D-man Paul Martin is eyeing St. Louis as a possible destination come July first .
When asked what his least favorite thing about hockey , a highly rated player answered practice !
No wonder the kid slipped out of the first round .
I coach kids and for the sake of the player I wo n’t name him here as he ’s only 18 and has a long way to go .
Atlanta took Russian Alexander Burmistov over Tarasenko primarily because he does n’t have an contract to play in the KHL next season .
The CHL produced 51 % of the draft selections in LA .
The WHL led the way with 43 followed by the OHL with 42 and the QMJHL with 22 .
Willie Mitchell has yet to be cleard mediacally to play next season but expects to have that done very soon .
The Penguins expect to turn to Billy Guerin after they decide what they 're going to do with Sergei Gonchar but it ’s far from a slam dunk that he returns to Pittsburgh next season .
Penguins Head Coach Dan Bylsma and Blues Head Coach Davis
Payne took a fishing trip together earlier this summer .
There was a loud ovation late in the first round when Anaheim selected Emerson Etem with the 29th pick .
Part of that ovation was from a T.V. crew who came all the way down from Medicine Hat , Alberta to film a documentary on the kid and his family .
They told me Anaheim saved the film .
Scouts with the Florida Panthers told Moose Jaw’s Quinton Howden , who they took in round one , that they were only interested in character kids .
They then turned around and took John McFarland with their 1st pick in round two who had some character question marks coming into the draft .
Both Howden and McFarland were the first overall picks in the 2007 WHL and OHL bantam draft respectively .
Some of these tampering stories I ’m hearing going on right now are very interesting .
Joel Quenneville will be taking the Stanley Cup back to his native Windsor , Ontario later this summer .
The cup will also make an appearance at the annual Canada Day Parade in Windsor .
I ’m told this might be the first time the Memorial Cup and the Stanley Cup have ever made an appearance at the same time in the Parade .
I love the trends that take place among NHL GM ’s and in this case trading for players negotiating rights .
I understand the advantage of having an opportunity to be the only team to negotiate with a player but unless you know you ’re going to sign him why not just wait another week or two and sign him without giving up anything .
The Blachawks are waiting to learn if John Torchetti will be leaving to join the staff in Atlanta .
Quenneville on Chris Pronger “ Smartest player I ’ve ever been around ” .
I noticed 11 Americans were taken in the first round of the draft but not one of them came out of the USHL which is our top junior league .
Jaden Schwartz did come out of the USHL but he ’s Canadian .
I do n’t count the kids coming out of the Development program as USHL players as the U - 18 and the U - 17 teams split the schedule .
Brandon Gormley who was taken 13th by Phoenix is best friends with Jaden Schwartz .
The two arrived at the draft together and shared a room over the weekend .
“ He ’s electrifying , a fearless player who will block shots .
Some try to find a negative because of his size but there ’s nothing he can’t do , ” Gormley said about Schwartz .
Blues Clues !
The Blues did a real nice job of piecing together a diverse draft class .
They came away with size and high end skill .
How many teams can say they took a player from the USHL , Russia , Minnesota , Finland , Sweden , QMJHL and the WHL ?
Jaden Schwartz -
Blues love his hockey sense and ability to score .
He ’s been a superstar point getter at every level he ’s played including at Notre Dame in he SJHL where he broke several offensive records .
He sees players others do n’t and has an incredible level of hockey sense .
The numbers this kid has put up are crazy .
The USHL is not an easy league to produce points as scouts often refer to it as a Roller Derby league meaning guys are coming at you from all angles and play as hard as they can every single night .
He was Canada ’s # 2 center behind Tyler Seguin in the recent U - 18 World Championships .
The focus he ’s demonstrated while his sister Mandi battles cancer says a lot about this kid .
The Schwartz family continues to look for a bone - marrow match she desperately needs .
Please go to www.becomemandishero.com for more info on helping out the Schwartz family .
Sebastian Wannstrom - The Blues were surprised he was around at # 44 in the second round .
Like David Perron he was skipped over in his first year of draft eligibility .
Plays like Lars Eller , not afraid to play inside .
Still needs to add strength .
Led Sweden ’s Junior Elite League in scoring .
Max Gardiner - This Minnesota High Schooler was taken in the third round .
He plays a power forward game who can play wing or center .
Uses body very well and could project to become a second line winger .
Will attend University of Minnesota next year .
Jani Hakanpaa -
This 4th rounder is a big D-man and compares well size wise to Eric Brewer .
Can run a power play and move the puck in transition which has the Blues hopeful he develops into a top 4 D-man .
He had a strong World Junior tourney playing for Finland .
Cody Beach - in the fifth round the Blues added some serious toughness with this 6 ’ 5 184 pound forward .
He ’s been described to me as crazy and a bigger version of Cam Janssen .
Stepehen MacAulay - Taken in the 6th round out of the QMJHL played anywhere from the first to the fourth line on a stacked St. John Sea Dogs roster .
He ’s a beanpole at only 168 pounds which the Blues are hoping fills out to around 210 one day .
Can play wing or center and can kill penalties .
People who watch him on a regular basis tell me he compares well to Jay McClement .
The Blues say newly acquired Vladimir Sobotka will be ready to play by training camp after having his shoulder operated on in May .
He ’s a guy who should be a decent 4th line center who creates energy and can bury every now and then .
He can skate and plays a real hard game who gets under the skin of the opposition .
Should make the roster next fall .
Former 7th round pick of the Blues Max Tardy plays with Schwartz in Tri Cities .
Congrats to St. Louis kids D-man John Ramage who was taken by Calgary in the 4th round , D-man Tony Dehart who was drafted in the 5th round by the Islanders and forward Michael Parks who the Flyers selected in the fifth as well .
Dehart , who played the last few years in the OHL , won a National title with Phillip McRae several years ago with the AAA Blues and once participated in the Blues development camp .
Basil McRae coached Dehart for a long time here in St. Louis .
Parks came up with the AAA Blues organization where he played several years .
One scout in reference to Ramage ..
" All he does is win .
" If you have a minute go to www.espn.go.com/espys to vote for Team USA Sled Hockey goalie Steve Cash .
He posted five straight shutouts in the recent Paralympics .
He did not allowing a single goal in Vancouver en route to a Gold Medal .
Cash is up for best male athlete with a disability .
I thought it was a class move for John Davidson to only send up Larry Pleau and Jarmo Kekalainen to the podium before Blues made their first selection .
If anything Doug Armstrong has shown he has some stones and is n't afraid to make some moves .
He 's already traded two former 1st rounders , traded for a number one goaltender , and made the move to allow Jarmo to get a Russian player he coveted .

Equine Photography is an art form all to itself .
Each breed has special poses and preferences that one should note before attempting to take pictures of their horse .
To make matters worse , photographing horses often involves no less than three people , the rider or handler of the horse , the photographer , and the person whose job it is to stand out of the picture and get the horse to put its ears forward .
Get the Location in Order
Decide where you will be photographing the horse .
A green pasture looks better than a muddy coral .
Professional breeders often keep a special pasture ( or their front yard ) used only for photography purposes , as such it always looks pristine .
Less clutter makes a better picture .
You will want the sun high or behind you ( the photographer ) as this will put the light on the animal .
photo source a very nice picture , note how the horses head is in front of the sky rather than the trees , which would have been distracting .
I would have prefered not to see this large halter on the horse .
Get the Horse Looking its Best
The horse needs to be bathed and groomed as if it was attending a horse show .
Clip its whiskers , bridle path , and ears ( how much you clip the ears depends on your weather , but at least pinch the sides together and trim the fuzzies that stick out ) .
They can have baby oil on their muzzle , around their eyes , and in their ears ( if fully shaved ) .
In shots of the whole horse care should be taken that it is groomed well , white markings look white , the feed should be polished .
Tack should be equally cleaned and prepared .
The rider should be as equally turned out for the shoot .
The Plan
Have an idea in your mind of the pictures you want to capture .
Perhaps you are looking for a natural shot of your horse at play , or a more posed one .
Perhaps you are looking for a shot of the whole horse , or just a neck / shoulder shot .
Perhaps you want an action shot , of the horse under saddle , or going over a jump .
Have your plan in mind .
If you are going to get some natural shots , and some under saddle , do the natural ones first or you will have a sweaty horse with saddle marks .
Again it is a good idea to look at pictures of your breed to know what kinds of poses are best suited to it .
photo source Quarter horses are frequently photographed from behind to show off their muscular hindquarters .
Usually they are stood square with their head turned , this one is clearly at play .
They could have cropped the person out of the picture .
With most horses standing shots , when taken from the side , should show all the horses legs .
This is best done if the near front leg is placed slightly ahead of the far front leg .
The near rear leg should be placed slightly further back than the other .
The horses head should be either a perfect profile or turned slightly towards the camera .
Care should be taken that the entire horse is within the camera frame .
The main trick is to get the horses ears forward .
This is where another helper is important .
They need to be creative and have a “ bag of tricks ” .
Throwing balls into the air , jumping up and down , dressing up in mascot costumes ( I have even seen one assistant wear a white bear skin ) .
You need to do things that the horse is not familiar with and will not expect .
If the horse has been handled well to this point , it will not be spooked , but instead will be keen on the unusual activity and put its ears forward .
Action Shots
Action shots involve using a better camera .
Move the camera with the horse so the background is blurred but the horse is in focus .
Except over fences , most action shots are at the trot , particularly for English horses .
You will want to take the picture when the far front leg is at its height .
At a canter , or lope , take the picture when the front legs are extended .
Over fences you need to take the picture just before ( or just as ) the horse girth area is over the fence , when the knees are tucked .
Face Shots
Be sure you have yourself at a good angle , the horses head should be turned so you can see the markings , but not so angled the photo becomes out of proportion .
Again , having the ears forward is key to having a good picture .
photo source a good picture except for the fact the horses ears are back , a bit more light on the face might have been good too .
Cropping
When the photos are done be sure to crop out excess areas of space , but always leave more room in front of the horse .
Take care never to crop too close to the horse or to remove parts of is body , legs , ears , or tail .
Crop head shots close , but make sure you keep the neck in the picture , ideally showing a bit of the shoulder too .
photo source a nice amount of space was left in front of the horse , but sadly its feet were cut off .

For the first time , the NHL Winter Classic will be contested in Canada and the United States , Hockey Night in Canada confirmed Thursday night .
League commissioner Gary Bettman is expected to make the official announcement at a 2 p.m. ET news conference Friday in Chicago , site of Game 1 of the Stanley Cup final on Saturday ( CBC , CBCSports.ca , 8 p.m. ET ) .
Pittsburgh 's Heinz Field will play host to the New Year 's Day game next January between the hometown Penguins and the Washington Capitals , while Montreal will travel to McMahon Stadium in Calgary in February to battle the Flames .
McMahon Stadium has a seating capacity of 35,650 but was expanded to 46,020 for the 2009 Grey Cup game .
It 's believed the reason for the separate dates is because the NHL 's ice - making trailer can only be used at one venue .
McMahon Stadium , site of the 1988 Winter Olympic opening ceremony , also has a large crown in the field that would pose a challenge for Dan Craig and his ice - making team .
The CBC suggested the doubleheader to the NHL , with the second game to take place in Canada after the success of the Winter Classic the last two years .
On New Year 's Day 2010 , Boston 's Marco Sturm slammed home the overtime winner after taking a perfect pass from teammate Patrice Bergeron to give the Bruins a 2 - 1 win against the Philadelphia Flyers in front of a sellout gathering of 38,112 at Fenway Park .
In 2009 , the Detroit Red Wings scored five unanswered goals en route to a 6 - 4 victory before 40,818 at Chicago 's Wrigley Field .
The inaugural Winter Classic in 2008 saw Buffalo host Sidney Crosby and the Penguins at Ralph Wilson Stadium .
Edmonton and Montreal played in the Heritage Classic , an outdoor game held at Edmonton 's Commonwealth Stadium in 2003 .
Federal officials Friday scrambled to get ready for the possibility that a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico could shut down containment operations at BP ’s leaking well and wash large quantities of oil ashore .
A low - pressure area brewing on the northeast coast of Honduras and Grand Cayman has a 70 % chance of becoming a tropical storm in the next 48 hours , according to the National Hurricane Center .
Computer models show the storm taking one of two possible routes : moving northwest toward the border of Texas and Louisiana , or northeast across the spill toward the Florida Panhandle .
Coast Guard Adm .
Thad Allen , the Obama administration ’s point man on the spill , said Friday that federal , state and local governments , working with BP , had a “ very robust hurricane contingency plan . ”
Five days before gale - force winds , or 40 - knot winds , are forecast , Allen said , BP would begin to withdraw the tankers and equipment now capturing oil from the leaking well .
It would also shut down the rigs that are drilling relief wells , which are designed to ultimately plug the leak .
A tropical storm becomes a hurricane when winds hit 64 knots , or 75 mph .
BP tankers are collecting more than 20,000 barrels of oil a day from a pipe leading down to the wellhead 50 miles off Louisiana .
“ A storm with gale - force winds could move into a [ Category ] 2 , 3 or 4 hurricane by the time it gets there , ” Allen said .
A storm would have “ a very negative effect , ” Allen said .
“ At some point we ’re going to have to break production and get those production units to a safer locale .... [ Our ] overall goal in this whole thing is the safety of our personnel .
And there are a lot of people on those rigs out there . ”
The prospect of withdrawing containment equipment and allowing the blown - out well to spew with uncontrolled force is alarming officials along the gulf .
Sen. Bill Nelson ( D - Fla . ) released a letter Friday calling for Navy vessels to be positioned to help skim oil after any storm passes .
“ Figure several days downtime as the storm approaches , a few more days as the storm passes , and a couple more days to get things back into place — and you ’re facing up to 10 days or more of the well gushing some 60,000 barrels a day unchecked , ” Nelson said .
“ That ’s 600,000 barrels we ’d then have to collect quickly after a storm passed , and before it could hit parts of the Gulf Coast , ” Nelson said .
“ Right now , there just is n’t enough capacity or bigger ships to collect and skim that much oil . ”
Allen acknowledged the problem , but told reporters , “ I understand the need to skim the oil as soon as we can , but it ’s going to be after the storm passes .
I do n’t think anybody wants a vessel out there trying to skim oil with the weather building beyond gale - force winds . ”
He said that Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida would serve as a rescue and coordination center in the event of a hurricane and that “ an extensive amount of work is going on between the Coast Guard and " the Federal Emergency Management Agency to prepare .
The brewing storm system is expected to gather intensity before it reaches the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico over the weekend .
“ We ’ll know how strong it will become over the next couple of days , probably by Tuesday , ” said Jeff Masters , director of meteorology at Weather Underground , a private forecasting service .
Louisiana ’s wildlife - rich coast has a shallow and gently sloping sea bottom , with little ability to stop waves or oil .
A tropical storm in the gulf can create waves as high as 12 feet , Masters said .
Even 4 - foot storm surges “ would certainly put a lot of oil inland , transported by winds , ” he said .
At Florida ’s tourist - dependent Pensacola Beach on Friday , the mood was one of wishful thinking .
Even as BP cleanup crews patrolled the beach , officials lifted a swimming ban on the county beach after noting that tar balls and swaths of black oil that washed ashore earlier in the week had been removed and had not re-appeared , said Molly Payne - Hardin , a spokeswoman for the Escambia County Health Department .
The University of West Florida and the state Department of Health are testing water samples , she said .
But authorities had yet to see the results Thursday .
Meanwhile federal officials did not lift an advisory warning against swimming at the adjacent Gulf Island National Seashore .
Meanwhile , a 2009 financial disclosure form was released Friday for New Orleans federal judge Martin L.C. Feldman , who issued an injunction earlier in the week halting the Obama administration ’s six - month moratorium on deep - water drilling in the gulf .
Feldman owned shares in at least 17 oil and gas companies last year , including an unspecified interest in Transocean Ltd. , the owner of the rig that exploded in the April 20 accident .
His holdings are not known to include any of the drilling service companies that brought suit against the moratorium .

Times staff writers Julie Cart in Los Angeles , Richard Simon in Washington and Molly Hennessy - Fiske in Pensacola , Fla. , contributed to this report .
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney is set to introduce a new law that will make it a criminal offence for anyone to offer immigration services without being a registered consultant .
The Cracking Down on Crooked Consultants Act , to be unveiled in Parliament Tuesday , will allow law enforcement authorities to lay criminal charges against the so - called “ ghost consultants , ” who prey on vulnerable to - be migrants but are off the officials ’ radar , the Star has learned .
Such individuals could face a $ 50,000 fine and a two - year jail term upon conviction .
The changes come two years after a Star investigative series that exposed the problem of unscrupulous immigration consultants who have continued to take advantage of the law ’s loopholes despite a new regulatory body Ottawa established in 2004 to weed out these operations .
“ The new legislation will crack down crooked consultants who are exploiting tens of thousands of people who dream of coming to this country , ” one source told the Star .
“ This has created an entire industry of underground ghost consultants who offer people fraudulent advice and counterfeit documents and never fulfill their promises — this has obviously been a long - standing problem . ”
Examples of consultants taking advantage of the system include charging applicants for refugee claims when they ’re not real refugees or taking applicants ’ money without completing the necessary paperwork .
Currently , RCMP and Canada Border Services
Agency officers can only go after those unauthorized individuals whose names appear in immigration or refugee applications as the legal representatives — but ghost consultants never identify themselves in any official document .
Often , immigrant and refugee applicants have to bear the consequences of such frauds and misrepresentation , seeing their cases unnecessarily rejected and their dreams shattered .
The criminalization of unauthorized consultants was one of the key recommendations put forward by the all - party parliamentary citizenship and immigration standing committee , which conducted a nation - wide consultation in 2008 to revamp the consultants ’ regulatory system after the Star investigation .
The Star series found that the consultants ’ regulator , the Canadian Society of Immigration Consultants , only has the authority to regulate its 1,500 members but was itself engulfed in and consumed with internal management issues — pushing some frustrated consultants to practise underground .
It ’s not yet known if the government will seek an overhaul of the regulatory body .
Another source told the Star that the proposed legislation will allow improved information - sharing among enforcement authorities and the regulator “ on individuals providing unethical or unprofessional representation or advice . ”
These changes will complement the immigration department ’s public awareness campaign in the past year to warn immigration and refugee applicants of the use of unauthorized consultants and its improved web - based application tools that make it easier for applicants to file applications on their own .

One of the two sources also said , as part of the overall crackdown strategy , the Canadian government plans to sign bilateral and multinational agreements with other countries to crack down on fraudulent activities of overseas immigration consultants , who are out of Canada ’s reach .
Unpaid third parties , such as family members , friends and not - for - profit community groups , who provide immigration services , would not be affected by the new law .
( CNN ) --
A proposed Arizona law would deny birth certificates to children born in the United States to illegal immigrant parents .
The bill comes on the heels of Arizona passing the nation 's toughest immigration law .
John Kavanagh , a Republican state representative from Arizona who supports the proposed law aimed at so - called " anchor babies , " said that the concept does not conflict with the U.S. Constitution .
" If you go back to the original intent of the drafters ... it was never intended to bestow citizenship upon ( illegal ) aliens , " said Kavanagh , who also supported Senate Bill 1070 -- the law that gave Arizona authorities expanded immigration enforcement powers .
Under federal law , children born in the United States are automatically granted citizenship , regardless of their parents ' residency status .
i Reporter supports the bill
Kyrsten Sinema , a Democratic state representative , strongly opposes the bill .
" Unlike ( Senate Bill ) 1070 , it is clear this bill runs immediately afoul of the U.S. Constitution , " she said .
" While I understand that folks in Arizona and across the country support S.B. 1070 , they do so because we have seen no action from the federal government , " said Sinema .
" Unfortunately , the so - called ' anchor baby ' bill does nothing to solve the real problems we are facing in Arizona . "

Back in 2008 , when Barack Obama was running for President , he took a politically unpopular stand on the gas tax .
Both John McCain and Hillary Clinton were calling for a gas -tax “ holiday ” to stimulate the economy .
Obama took the side of most economists ( not to mention our very own Justin Fox ) in saying that a lower gas tax might play well at the polls but was n’t actually smart economic policy .
Where is that principle now ?
Boston Globe columnist Derrick Jackson points out that as Congressional debate around energy reform kicks into gear , the President is surprisingly quiet about the most obvious way to tackle excessive fossil fuel consumption : getting people to burn less gas in motor vehicles .
Jackson notes that sales of SUVs rose by 32 % in May , compared to a year earlier , while sales of cars grew by just 16 % .
He writes :
If this is still the way that young and affluent Americans display how they ’ve done well , and if this is what we call putting America back to work , then we ’re in more trouble than we thought .
The oil spill began in April , yet SUVs flew out of showrooms in May .
Obama says that without a major change in energy policy we will “ jeopardize our national security ’’ and “ smother our planet . ’’
Yet , America still uses the SUV , with its overblown image of safety , as its security blanket , not worrying who or what the blanket smothers .
The oft - repeated absurdity is this : the federal gas tax has n’t changed since 1993 .
It was 18.4 cents a gallon then , and it ’s 18.4 cents a gallon now .
Taking inflation out of the equation , the effective tax has gone down to 12.2 cents a gallon .
Environmental issues aside for a moment , that ’s a huge problem considering that our nation ’s roads ( and bridges and tunnels ) are falling apart .
The Highway Trust Fund , which takes the gas tax and pays for infrastructure projects , is practically bankrupt .
Even the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , not exactly a pro-tax group , is clamoring for an increase in the gas tax ( a “ user fee ” to the Chamber ’s way of thinking ) since roads are so important to companies shipping goods and supplies around the country .
But back to the issue of how much fossil fuel we burn .
Plenty of evidence points to the fact that when gas prices go up Americans buy more fuel - efficient cars .
See , for example , the 1970s .
Or this more - recent paper , which finds that a $ 1 - a - gallon increase at the pump leads to a 20 % jump in market share for the most fuel - efficient cars ( those in the top quartile in terms of efficiency ) and a 24 % drop in market share for the least fuel - efficient ( the bottom quartile ) .
So why are n’t more of our leaders , like the President , pushing the idea ?
I ’m guessing it has something to do with mid-term elections .
Good policy is no match for the need to get re-elected .
The AP reports that Congress probably wo n’t even take up reauthorization of the nation ’s major highway and transit legislation ( which needs a re-vote every five years ) , at least in part because of the fear of having to deal with the possibility of raising the gas tax .
Now that ’s some leadership in action .
Gov. Ed Rendell and lawmakers agreed Thursday after their first official budget negotiation that a willingness to compromise exists in order to finish next year 's budget by the June 30 deadline .
After last year 's 101 - day standoff and in a re-election year for many lawmakers , officials have said that enacting a spending plan on time for the fiscal year that begins July 1 is their No. 1 priority .
But at a news conference Thursday afternoon , Rendell signaled that he would be willing to blow past that deadline to fight for funding public education , one of the priorities of his two - term tenure .
The state faces a $ 1.2 billion budget deficit and Rendell is asking lawmakers to approve a $ 354 million increase in basic - education funding .
" There 's room for compromise , " Rendell said .
" But let me say there 's nothing more important to the commonwealth 's future — nothing .
And guys , I 'm ready .
I 'm ready for 101 days if it 's necessary . "
Rendell , a Democrat , and Senate Republican leaders remained coy about where they hoped an overall spending figure for next year 's budget would fall .
Rendell said it will be less than the $ 29 billion figure he proposed this spring , but would not name a new target .
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Jake Corman , R - Centre County , said they are starting with $ 27.5 billion , the amount all parties agree they have for next year if no other revenue is added from taxes or fund transfers .
" We 're not really starting at a spending number , " Corman said .
" We 're starting with what we have , which I think most people do when they do a budget .
So that 's where we are today . "

The Perils Of A Catholic Upbringing
Taking a trip to Atlanta recently , I was reminded of my youth and my heavy duty Catholic upbringing , Catholic schooling and of course , Catholic churchgoing .
After daily contacts with Priests and Nuns their words echoed sometimes for minutes , but there are several things I do retain and the trip to Atlanta opened the floodgates and the memories came pouring through .
Sister Magdalene and Father Bromfield were a great double act , not in a funny way but in a ‘ care for the sick , feed the hungry , clothe the naked and reach out and touch ’ way .
Admirable sentiments that should be taken seriously , even by the Catholic church .
Walking down Peachtree Street , or was it Peachtree Avenue , or Boulevard , everything ’s Peachtree something in Atlanta , I saw a person dressed in nothing but rags and the poor woman was carrying her worldly possessions in two plastic bags .
The words of Sister Magdalene and Father Bromfield entered my head and would not go away .
Sure , some people would be seeing only rags , but I saw the inner beauty , I wanted to care for this woman , feed her , replace her rags with finer clothes , I wanted to reach out and touch .
So I did .

MADMIKESAMERICA HOMEPAGE
Three days after the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico , the Dutch government offered to help .
It was willing to provide ships outfitted with oil - skimming booms , and it proposed a plan for building sand barriers to protect sensitive marshlands .
The response from the Obama administration and BP , which are coordinating the cleanup : “ The embassy got a nice letter from the administration that said , ‘ Thanks , but no thanks , ' ” said Geert Visser , consul general for the Netherlands in Houston .
Now , almost seven weeks later , as the oil spewing from the battered well spreads across the Gulf and soils pristine beaches and coastline , BP and our government have reconsidered .
U.S. ships are being outfitted this week with four pairs of the skimming booms airlifted from the Netherlands and should be deployed within days .
Each pair can process 5 million gallons of water a day , removing 20,000 tons of oil and sludge .
At that rate , how much more oil could have been removed from the Gulf during the past month ?
The uncoordinated response to an offer of assistance has become characteristic of this disaster 's response .
Too often , BP and the government do n't seem to know what the other is doing , and the response has seemed too slow and too confused .
Federal law has also hampered the assistance .
The Jones Act , the maritime law that requires all goods be carried in U.S. waters by U.S. - flagged ships , has prevented Dutch ships with spill - fighting equipment from entering U.S. coastal areas .
“ What 's wrong with accepting outside help ? ” Visser asked .
“ If there 's a country that 's experienced with building dikes and managing water , it 's the Netherlands . ”
Even if , three days after the rig exploded , it seemed as if the Dutch equipment and expertise was n't needed , would n't it have been better to accept it , to err on the side of having too many resources available rather than not enough ?
BP has been inundated with well - intentioned cleanup suggestions , but the Dutch offer was different .
It came through official channels , from a government offering to share its demonstrated expertise .
Many in the U.S. , including the president , have expressed frustration with the handling of the cleanup .
In the Netherlands , the response would have been different , Visser said .
There , the government owns the cleanup equipment , including the skimmers now being deployed in the Gulf .
“ If there 's a spill in the Netherlands , we give the oil companies 12 hours to react , ” he said .
If the response is inadequate or the companies are unprepared , the government takes over and sends the companies the bill .
While the skimmers should soon be in use , the plan for building sand barriers remains more uncertain .
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal supports the idea , and the Coast Guard has tentatively approved the pro-ject .
One of the proposals being considered was developed by the Dutch marine contractor Van Oord and Deltares , a Dutch research institute that specializes in environmental issues in deltas , coastal areas and rivers .
They have a strategy to begin building 60 - mile - long sand dikes within three weeks .
That proposal , like the offer for skimmers , was rebuffed but later accepted by the government .
BP has begun paying about $ 360 million to cover the costs .
Once again , though , the Jones Act may be getting in the way .
American dredging companies , which lack the dike - building expertise of the Dutch , want to do the work themselves , Visser said .
“ We do n't want to take over , but we have the equipment , ” he said .
While he battles the bureaucracy , the people of Louisiana suffer , their livelihoods in jeopardy from the onslaught of oil .
“ Let 's forget about politics ; let 's get it done , ” Visser said .

Every day new activities around Linked Data are reported .
All this happens at a rate , which can be overwhelming .
Hence I think one should from time to time step back and have a chilled look at where we are concerning consumption of Linked Data .
In the following I try to sum up a ( rather high - level ) view on the current state of the art and highlight ongoing challenges :
As you can see , the more we get away from the data ( discovery , access ) and move into the direction of information , the fewer available solutions are there .
From an application perspective aiming at exploiting Linked Data , the integrated , cleaned , information is of value , not the raw , distributed and dirty ( interlinked ) RDF pieces out there .
In my experience , most of the consolidation and nurturing is still done on the application - level in an ad - hoc manner .
There is plenty of room for frameworks and infrastructure to supply this functionality .
No matter if you ’re a start - up , a first - year student or a CIO in an established company – have a look at the challenges and remember : now is the right time to come up with solutions .
You and the Web will benefit from it .
UPDATE : I originally had ‘ Nurture ’ as a label for this ( * ) task , however due to multiple requests I changed it to ‘ Curation ’ ( IMO a bit of a Germanism , but , alas … ) .
Secondly , thanks to another comment I updated the examples for the ‘ Discovery ’ task with Sindice and SPARQL Service Description .
Francisco ( Paco ) Santos ’s paper “ A Counterexample to the Hirsch Conjecture ” is now out :
For some further information and links to the media see also this page .
Here is a link to a TV interview .
Abstract : The Hirsch Conjecture ( 1957 ) stated that the graph of a - dimensional polytope with facets cannot have ( combinatorial ) diameter greater than .
That is , that any two vertices of the polytope can be connected to each other by a path of at most edges .
This paper presents the first counter - example to the conjecture .
Our polytope has dimension 43 and 86 facets .
It is obtained from a 5 - dimensional polytope with 48 facets which violates a certain generalization of the - step conjecture of Klee and Walkup .
This is certainly a major event .
The Hirsch conjecture with the very appealing “ non-revisiting ” formulation , with the neat formula , and with the many equivalent forms , captured the imagination of many people .
We saw it here :
When we tried to discuss related questions , most people and most comments targeted the original conjecture itself .
The proof demonstrates not only Paco ’s own ingenuity and endurance but also the steady progress in constructing polytopes and related combinatorial objects .
The computer package POLYMAKE created by Ewgenij Gawrilow and Michael Joswig played an important role in giving a different verification of the properties of the five - dimensional construction in the paper .
Paco quotes Klee and Kleinschmidt who wrote that “ finding a counterexample will be merely a small first step in the line of investigation related to the conjecture . ”
But it is left to be seen if related questions such as the “ polynomial Hirsch conjecture ” will also draw as much interest as the original conjecture did .
Certainly , Paco ’s achievement may lead to renewed interest in these related problems .
So it is time to read , learn and discuss the paper .
( It is good that our term just ended . )
I ’ll confess up front to being a Walmart stockholder .
The company ’s annual report arrived in my mail last week , with the statement on the front , “ We save people money so they can live better . ”
A number of studies ( for example , here , and here ) suggest that Walmart has lowered prices significantly in the United States , supporting the claim on their annual report cover .
They are not just saving money for people in the United States .
More than half their stores are outside the United States , including 1,469 in Mexico and 279 in China .
In making this comparison , I do n’t mean to minimize Mother Teresa ’s help for the poor .
Wikipedia reports that her Missionaries of Charity , which she founded in 1950 in Calcutta , had expanded to 610 missions in 123 countries by the time she died in 1997 .
Worldwide , the percentage of people living in extreme poverty declined from about 40 % in 1981 to about 21 percent in 2001 .
Most of that decline was in East Asia , where China and other countries moved away from central economic planning toward market economies .
We ca n’t give Sam Walton credit for all that , but the move toward economic freedom more generally probably deserves most ( or all ) of the credit .
Walmart sells in China , but the also buy Chinese products , and their presence in the market has forced other competitors to be more efficient and more productive .
Private charity helps lots of people , and Mother Teresa did some great things .
I ’m not arguing that markets can replace private charitable activity .
But the well - being of humankind — including the poor — has been improved much more by the economic progress generated by market institutions than it has by charitable activities .
Perhaps the right is rattled by the SWAT team they believed had been called up to disperse a tea party demonstration in Quincy , IL , but which turned out to be local police in body armor clearing the street to enable President Obama ’s motorcade to pass through .
But whatever the cause , they ’re now seeing the specter of SWAT teams everything .
On Friday afternoon , for example , a headline at the Drudge Report proclaimed , “ Obama Sends SWAT Teams to Oil Rigs … ”
ADVERTISEMENT
It linked to a CBS News story from the previous day which reported , “ Mr. Obama , speaking at an event for the 2010 National Teacher of the Year , said he had been receiving frequent briefings on the situation and that he is prepared to use the resources of the Department of Defense if necessary to deal with the oil spill .
…
Mr. Obama said SWAT teams were being dispatched to the Gulf to investigate oil rigs and said his administration is now working to determine the cause of the disaster . ”
Rush Limbaugh had already pounced on this story and woven it into a conspiracy theory .
He told his audience on Thursday , “ I did n’t hear this myself , but I have been informed that President Obama is sending SWAT teams to the Gulf oil rigs .
SWAT teams ?
I ’m waiting on audio sound bite confirmation of this , but why in the world would you send SWAT teams to Gulf oil rigs ?
Oh , I know !
Obama probably thinks the tea party blew up the rig .
That ’s what it is .
( laughing ) …
We had this call from a guy out there who said nobody ’s talking about whether this was an act of sabotage because I guess they ca n’t prove it , but they ’re going to send SWAT teams down there ? ”
Drudge did not link to any more current story to provide a better explanation of the president ’s remarks , but a Friday column by Ed O’Keefe at the Washington Post , which explains , “ The department deployed SWAT teams from the Minerals Management Service to inspect 30 drilling rigs operating in the deepwater sections of the Gulf of Mexico .
Inspections should be completed within the next week , according to an Interior Department spokeswoman .
Inspectors will check to see whether the rigs have conducted blow - out preventer tests and inspect related records . ”
The key here is that the teams were sent out by the Minerals Management Service , a section of the Department of the Interior which “ plays a key role in AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s energy supply by managing the mineral resources on 1.7 billion acres of the Outer Continental Shelf ( OCS ) .
This includes managing Renewable Energy Programs as well as Offshore Oil and Gas Leasing in Federal waters . ”
Although ithe acronym is not entirely clear , “ SWAT ” in this context could simply stand for “ Swift Action Team , ” or it might represent something similar to the “ soil and water assessment tool ” used by the Department of Agriculture to monitor complex watersheds .

There are also references online to the Obama administration creating a “ SWAT team ” within the Office of Management and Budget to set performance improvement targets
However , the immediate response to the word “ SWAT ” immediately aroused the specter of an armed government intervention .
Paul Joseph Watson at Prison Planet , wrote on Friday , “ Radio talk show host and former Reagan cabinet advisor Mark Levin has slammed President ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s bizarre announcement that he will be sending SWAT teams to deal with the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , alleging that the response is part of a plan to grease the skids for government takeover and nationalization of the oil industry . ”
“ Levin alleged that the response was a precursor to government nationalization of the oil industry via the back door . ”
Watson ’s story continued .
“ ‘ I think those SWAT teams are there in coordination with the attorney generalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s office , the Interior Department , Homeland Security , maybe the EPAÃ¢â‚ ¬Â¦. to seize records at these sites and to lay the foundation for more government takeover , ’ he stated . ”
James Lane at All New York News reports :
The Green Party of New York State kicked off its 2010 statewide campaign by evoking the legacy of Eleanor Roosevelt by calling for a “ Big Green New Deal ” that emphasizes human rights , living wage jobs for all , single payer health care , immigration reform , peace , and the right to education .
US Senate candidates Colia Clark and Dr. Cecile Lawrence joined with state comptroller candidate Dr. Julia Willebrand and Lt. Governor candidate Gloria Mattera to officially announce their campaigns in front of the Eleanor Roosevelt Monument in Manhattan .
They were accompanied by Green Party gubernatorial nominee Howie Hawkins , who officially launched his campaign in early May .
The candidates talked about the need to speak for the average New Yorker , just as Eleanor Roosevelt did on behalf of her disabled husband by traveling across the country to meet with everyday Americans during the Great Depression .
Colia Clark , a veteran of the civil rights movement , is running for the Senate seat presently held by Chuck Schumer .
Ms. Clark talked about the need to make quality education a right for all New Yorkers , regardless of their race or economic status .
Dr. Cecile Lawrence , who is running for the US Senate seat vacated by Hillary Clinton , has been active in the fight for universal health care and opposes the method of drilling for natural gas called High Volume Horizontal Hydrofracturing that threatens the health and welfare , as well as the water , of all of the residents of New York State .
Julia Willebrand , who receive more than 110,000 votes for State Comptroller in 2006 is running for that position again .
Willebrand , a former professor , spoke out against the drive by both parties to expand charter schools , which has proven to be a financial boondoggle at taxpayer expense for Wall Street financiers and hedge funds .
Gloria Mattera , a peace and health care activist from Park Slope Brooklyn , criticized the Democrats for once again refusing to make health care a human right , instead passing a health care insurance mandate to penalize any American who fails to buy expensive and inadequate health insurance .
Howie Hawkins , the Green Party nominee for Governor , is a member of the Teamsters Union in Syracuse .
Mr. Hawkins stated that at least one million jobs are needed to have full employment in New York State , and jobs in child care , elder care , parks & recreation programs , etc. can put people to work immediately with little training .
Additionally , New York should invest in improving our housing and infrastructure , including energy efficiency retrofits , mass transit , inter - urban rails , and water and sewer lines .
This would also include a rapid conversion to a sustainable green economy to avert irreversible climate catastrophe , ocean acidification , and other environmental damages that are leading toward ecological collapse .
The Green Party of New York State is committed to ecology , grassroots democracy , social and economic justice and nonviolence .
It needs at least 50,000 votes for Governor to help restore its rights as an official political party in NY .

Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo says the European Grand Prix set a dangerous precedent that could damage the credibility of Formula 1 .
The Italian squad has been fuming since McLaren 's Lewis Hamilton finished in second position in the Valencia race despite being given a drive - through penalty .
Ferrari believes the penalty came too late and as a result the Briton was able to keep his position despite breaking the rules by having overtaken the safety car early in the race .
Fernando Alonso , running right behind Hamilton when the safety car was deployed , stayed behind it and wound up finishing in ninth as a consequence .
Another nine drivers received five - second penalties after the race for having breaking the safety car delta time rules .
Di Montezemolo said on Monday that the situation was unacceptable and that it cast a shadow over the credibility of the sport .
" The result of yesterday 's race was misrepresentative , " di Montezemolo said on Ferrari 's website .
" Ferrari , which showed itself to be competitive in the European Grand Prix , paid a price that was too high for respecting the rules .
" Meanwhile those who did n't follow the rules were penalised by the race officials in a way that was less severe than the damage suffered by those who did respect them .
" That is a very serious and unacceptable event that creates dangerous precedents , throwing a shadow over the credibility of Formula 1 .
" We are sure that the FIA will fully analyse what happened , taking the consequent necessary decisions .
Ferrari will watch this with interest . "
Flashback : Trent Reznor and Al Jourgensen ’s Dance Daze
Ah , the salad days .
Some people may not know it , but both Ministry ’s Al Jourgensen and Nine Inch Nails ’ Trent Reznor were actually synth pop and glammy before finding their industrial edge .
Many fans remember those times before The Land Of Rape And Honey and Pretty Hate Machine ( respectively ) transformed both groups into heavier industrial rock entities , and then Psalm 69 and The Downward Spiral smashed them through mainstream barriers .
For those that do , the following two videos from the mid-’80s are nostalgic throwbacks .
For younger ( and some older ) listeners who have only heard the heavy stuff , this video couplet will certainly come as a surprise .
It ’s not that you ca n’t dance to these groups now ; you ’re just more likely to slamdance .
Pirates in the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia have captured a Singapore - flagged cargo ship with 19 Chinese crew on board , maritime authorities said .
The Golden Blessing cargo ship is a petroleum and chemical tanker .
It was travelling to India from Saudi Arabia when it was hijacked .
All 19 crew are reported to be safe .
Rescue efforts had begun according to the China Marine Rescue Centre .
Singapore maritime authorities said the ship had been chartered to Shanghai Dingheng Shipping Co Ltd , adding that they were closely monitoring the situation .
An employee of Golden Pacific International Holdings , which owns the ship , told AFP news agency that the company was in contact with the crew .
" The crew so far is safe , " said the staff member , who asked not to be named .
He added that no ransom demand had been made so far .
In October 2009 , a Chinese cargo ship with 25 crew members on board was captured by pirates northeast of the Seychelles as it was sailing to India from South Africa .
Last year was the most active yet for Somali pirates , with more than 200 attacks , including 68 successful hijackings and $ 50 m paid out in ransoms , according to unofficial figures .
Fatherhood and Other Things That Ain’t Government ’s Business
In conjunction with Father 's Day , the Obama administration unveiled Fatherhood.gov , a website offering advice to men on raising kids .
Why is this a job for the federal government ?
James Joyner · · 23 comments
In conjunction with Father ’s Day , the Obama administration yesterday unveiled Fatherhood.gov , a website offering various advice to men on raising kids that ’s drawn quite a bit of more - or - less good natured hectoring from the blogosphere .
( See Glenn Reynolds , Stephen Green , and Radley Balko for examples . )
Ira Stoll ‘s posting is getting particular attention , with Reynolds highlighting a section questioning why the government thinks itself competent to tell Americans how to raise our kids when it ca n’t even do its core functions particularly well and Kevin Drum highlighting this passage :
Here was tip number two : “ Watch a game on television with your children .
Cheer for your favorite team and chat about the plays .
Mute the commercials and use those minutes to talk about what ’s going on in your lives . ”
Here is the government telling Americans to “ mute the commercials . ”
Suppose I work at an advertising agency and earn my living making commercials , or own a company that has just invested millions of dollars in those commercials in the hope of winning customers and making a profit ?
Suppose I own a television network that makes its money by selling those commercials ?
Suppose I am a taxpayer who has just shelled out major bucks for the Army or the Census or some other branch of the government to buy these commercials , only to have another branch of the government instruct Americans not to listen to the same commercials my tax money was just spent to purchase .
If I had any advice for fathers , it would be to mute the ballgame and turn up the volume for the commercials , or turn off the tube altogether and go play a game with your child .
But now the government wants us to mute commercials ?
Really .
Drum snarks , “ Muting commercials is your beef against Barack Obama and his socialist minions ?
And conservatives wonder why the rest of us think their entire movement has gone stone crazy ? ”
Now , as one who occasionally mutes commercials and more frequently fast forwards past them , I have no great sense of civic commitment to watching them .
But here ’s where Stoll has has a point :
The federal government should not be taking a position on this issue !
Is this the biggest complaint I have against the federal government or the Obama administration ?
By no means .
Indeed , my preference is decidedly that , given the choice between watching commercials or talking to their children , American parents should choose the latter .
( Ceteris parabus , of course .
There are parents whose influence is so toxic that their kids would be better off doing anything else by being further infected . )
But this is not government ’s business .
As Stoll notes , there are taxpaying citizens who make a living selling commercials and selling products via commercials .
And there are other taxpaying citizens who make a living selling remote controls that allow the muting of commercials and recording devices that allow skipping of commercials .
Why is the president spending taxpayer money putting his thumb on the scales ?
Much of fatherhood .
com ’s other advice can be critiqued along those lines :
Experience the joy of reading without the cost of buying books .
Visit your community library and get a card for each member of your family .
Help your children select a variety of age - appropriate books you can borrow and read together .
I ’m betting the folks at Barnes and Noble and Amazon love this idea !
Watch a game on television with your children .
Cheer for your favorite team and chat about the plays .
Mute the commercials and use those minutes to talk about what ’s going on in your lives .
Aside from the aforementioned muting issue , Obama is telling Americans to choose one form of entertainment over another .
What about the people with shows up against the game ?
Or people selling tickets to the game itself ?
And what of Mrs. Obama ’s campaign against obesity ?
Why are these people sitting on their ass watching a game on TV instead of going out and playing themselves ?!
Spring cleaning will be off to a great start if you first tackle that list of home improvement chores with your children .
Little ones can find the hammer , wrench , or pliers in a toolbox while older kids can learn how to repair household items .
Will Obama take responsibility when the wee ones get hurt ?
Or do damage to the walls ?
Look , this is all pretty silly stuff .
It ’s not pernicious or even particularly wrongheaded .
But , again , why the hell is the federal government telling us how to raise our kids ?
All that said , Jonathan Chait ‘s post making fun of Stoll ’s technical competence is rather amusing .

The United States Senate recently rejected two separate proposals that would have allowed the importation of cheaper medication from other countries , apparently in order to preserve a deal between the pharmaceutical industry and the White House .
The proposals were part of a wider effort to reform the U.S. healthcare system , in large part by cutting unnecessary costs .
Drug importation was first proposed by Sen. Byron Dorgan , a Democrat from North Dakota , in an amendment to the healthcare bill .
The amendment would have allowed U.S. wholesale and retail drug distributors , including pharmacies , to import products from Australia , Canada , Europe , Japan or New Zealand , where price controls keep drug costs much lower than in the United States .
The amendment eventually gained more than 24 sponsors from both major parties .
" This issue is n't rocket science , " Dorgan said .
" The American people are charged the highest prices in the world .
They want Congress to stand up for their interests and do something about it .
" According to Dorgan and co-sponsor Sen. John McCain , a Republican from Arizona and former presidential candidate , drug importation could cut $ 80 billion off the country 's health spending over the next decade .
The United States spends $ 2.5 trillion on health care every year .
A vote on Dorgan 's proposal was blocked on December 10 by fellow Democratic Sen. Thomas R. Carper of Delaware , who expressed concerns over the safety of imported medications .
Like the FDA and the White House , Carper objected that the quality of imported drugs could not be assured .
" Senator Dorgan 's amendment could potentially allow unsafe , counterfeited drugs into the United States , contaminating our drug supply , " Carper said .
" This is a complicated issue that affects people 's lives .
We should make sure that the FDA says it 's safe before we reimport drugs from other countries . "
" My amendment includes strong safeguards to prohibit drug counterfeiting and other practices that would put the consumer at risk , " Dorgan replied .
" It applies only to FDA - approved prescription drugs produced in FDA - approved plants from countries with comparable safety standards .
" Other Senators charged that the real motive behind the claim of safety concerns was to preserve a recent deal between the White House and the pharmaceutical industry , in which the Pharmaceutical Research & Manufacturers of America ( PhRMA ) agreed to fund $ 80 billion worth of health care reform by accepting higher taxes and price agreements .
According to a number of congressional staffers and pharmaceutical industry lobbyists , the deal included a verbal promise by President Obama to not support drug importation .
" There 's great dissension in the Democrat caucus over Senator Dorgan 's amendment , " McCain said .
" If it passes , as it should , it breaks the agreement that the White House made with PhRMA .
So the White House , as well as PhRMA , has been over here lobbying furiously .
" PhRMA denied that it had made any such deal , but the group and the White House both made statements earlier in the year saying that drug importation will not be necessary if Congress approves a healthcare bill implementing lower prices on U.S. - made drugs .
The $ 315 billion pharmaceutical industry has been the biggest healthcare - related industry to support the White House 's healthcare reform effort .
It is also one of the most influential lobbies in the country .
" People are walking on eggshells , " Dorgan said .
" If we pass legislation allowing people freedom to import drugs , the pharmaceutical industry might not support the health care amendment .
"
In the end , Dorgan 's proposal , which needed 60 votes to be incorporated into the healthcare bill , failed 51 - 48 .
A separate amendment that would have allowed the importation of drugs specifically approved by the FDA also failed , 56 - 43 .
" The drug industry has a lot of clout in this town , and they demonstrated that tonight , " Dorgan said after the vote .
" This is not over .

DES MOINES , Iowa -
The siblings of a man who died more than a year ago must exhume his body so his head can be cut off and cryogenically frozen , the Iowa Court of Appeals has ruled .
The court sided this week with Scottsdale - based Alcor Life Extension Foundation , which sought to dig up the remains of 81 - year - old Orville Richardson of Burlington .
Richardson had signed a contract with Alcor in 2004 and paid $ 53,500 to have his head placed in cryonic suspension after his death .
When he died in February 2009 , Richardson 's brother and sister buried him instead , having told him earlier that they would have nothing to do with his plan , court records show .
Alcor learned of Richardson 's death two months afterward , when his brother , David Richardson , asked the Scottsdale , Ariz . - based company to refund the money already paid .
The company filed a lawsuit seeking to exhume Orville Richardson 's body at its own expense , but a Des Moines Country District Court judge denied the request .
The appeals court reversed that decision Wednesday .
It said the lower court should have granted Alcor 's request because Richardson 's siblings ignored their brother 's request , " despite knowledge he had made different arrangements . "
It was unclear what condition the body would be in .
According to Alcor , the cryonics process should begin within the first two minutes after a heart stops , and preferably within the first 15 minutes .
The company did not immediately respond to a message Friday .
Richardson 's sister , Darlene Broeker , declined to comment .
Attorneys in the case did not immediately return telephone messages Friday .
In its lawsuit , Alcor had argued that its contract with Richardson fell under the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act , which prohibits anyone other that the donor from revoking the donation .
The company asked the court to order Richardson 's siblings to obtain a permit to exhume his body .
David Richardson and Broeker argued that their brother entered his contract with Alcor before a 2006 revision to the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act took effect .
The district court agreed and ruled the pair had the right to control the " final disposition of Orville 's remains after his death . "
The court also agreed with them that Iowa 's disinterment statute did not apply because Alcor was not seeking autopsy or reburial - the only two reasons that a body can be exhumed under state law .
But the appeals court ruled that the 2006 revision to the Uniform Anatomic Gift Act prohibits anyone other than a donor from revoking the gift and that neither side in the case challenged the use of the law .
It also said Alcor meets the definition of a qualified group to accept human remains and that although Richardson had paid the company for its services , it " does not take the transaction outside the scope " of the law , " even if it ... may not qualify as a gift . "
The court also ruled that under Iowa 's disinterment code , the cryonic suspension of Richardson 's head and the cremation of the rest of his body would constitute " reburial . "
It 's an okay design ... but she does n't look like Wonder Woman .
It does n't have the same iconic vibe as the now ' old ' outfit .
Take off the Jacket , make the trousers form fitting ' short shorts # or something , maybe then it would look fine , I think .
It 'd be something still familiar to the classic WW look , but still new .
I 'm not a fan of the current design .
This makes no sense to me :
The White House said it backed “ significantly ” raising the cap on damages faced by energy firms that pollute the environment , as it demands BP pays in full for the Gulf oil spill .
Officials also hit out at fresh complaints by Republicans that it had not acted quickly enough in the immediate aftermath of an explosion on a rig in the Gulf of Mexico last month , which triggered the huge slick .
Under a law introduced after the Exxon Valdez oil tanker disaster in Alaska in 1989 , oil companies are bound by law to pay for the full clean - up and containment costs of any oil seeping from their facilities after an accident .
But the legislation caps the damages for which the firm is liable at 75 million dollars unless the company is guilty of “ gross negligence . ”
Bills introduced in the House and the Senate would fix the cap at 10 billion dollars .
Here ’s a revolutionary idea - why do n’t we get rid of the limit altogether !
If BP or Exxon cuts corners and makes a hash of things , and they cause 60 billion dollars worth of damage , they are on the hook for the whole 60 billion dollars !
And if they ca n’t pay for the whole bill , the company is liquidated , the shareholders get wiped out , and the company ceases to exist .
Why do n’t we give that a shot ?
And do n’t tell me it is because no one will then undertake oil drilling .
Of course they will !
They ’ll just pass on the costs to the consumer .
And should being really careful and safe cost too much money , then it might just make other forms of energy look cheaper by comparison , and spur investment in those energy types .
So how about it ?
No more immunity , no more corporate welfare , no more subsidizing industries that do n’t even pay a damned penny in taxes in the US anymore .
Exxon had billions in profit last year , and paid not one penny in taxes .
I ’d bet BP is in the same boat or close to it , so why should they make tons of money and force us to pay for their mistakes , especially when their mistakes were likely caused by attempts to make more money and underpay for the safety of their well .
We ’ll just have to make our corporate persons pull themselves up by their bootstraps .
It ’s the American way , after all .

Today , the United States faces Algeria in World Cup play , and thanks in part to the American draw versus England earlier in match play , the U.S. " controls its own destiny : " will advance to the next round with a win .
So when I happened to find out about the story below -- it immediately felt like a perfect fit for today .
It 's about the last time ( before this year ) that the U.S. and England matched up in World Cup play .
--
Dan
In 1950 , the U.S. Pulled Off a Huge World Cup Upset -- But No Major American Newspapers Had Sent Reporters to Cover It .
In the summer of 1950 , the World Cup resumed after a twelve - year hiatus due to the Second World War .
The United States sent a rag - tag bunch to tournament ; a team made mostly of semi- pros who , by day , were milkmen and mail carriers .
They were set to face the English national team , considered co-favorites to win the Cup , along with host country Brazil .
The Americans , on the other hand , went into Cup play having lost seven consecutive matches by a cumulative score of 45 - 2 .
That 's not a typo .
Forty - five to two .
But in the 37th minute of the match versus England , American captain William Bahr ( a schoolteacher ! ) took a shot from twenty - five feet out .
Teammate Joe Gaetjens headed it into the net , scoring the game 's only goal .
The Americans pulled off a historic upset , 1 - 0 .
The world was abuzz , with newspaper around the globe covering the upset on their front pages .
But amazingly , only one major American newspaper covered the story the next day .
Indeed , Bahr -- whose errant shot lead to the goal -- later told CNN , " I do n't think I did a single interview about the World Cup until 25 years later . "
How could this happen ?
To be blunt , it was simply a case of soccer not being very popular stateside .
Not a single American newspaper sent a reporter to the match , given the lack of interest .
The only story came via Dent McSkinning , a reporter for the St. Louis Post - Dispatch .
McSkinning took time off and , on his own dime , attended the Cup match .
He was the only American journalist at the match , and his report of the game was the only one in any major U.S. paper .
Hindsight is 20 / 20 , but foresight was nearly blind .
Bonus fact :
No one knows exactly what happened to Joe Gaetjens , the goal scorer , twenty years out .
A Haitian by birth , Gaetjens returned to Haiti later in life .
Reportedly , he was taken as a political prisoner and shot sometime in the 1960s or 70s , but understandably , there are no available records either way .
i remember coming up with this comic while walking through the OKC bombing memorial cus I am more in love with my own ideas than a bunch of people dying at once .
No wonder Israelis detained him for three days .
Jamal ElSheyyal , speaking from Istanbul :
There is no doubt from what I saw that live ammunition was fired before any Israeli soldier was on deck .
Indiscriminate fire from helicopter– one man shot in the top of the head .
Three shot passengers died because they did not get treatment over many hours .
Passenger violence : " I definitely saw iron bars . "
Passengers took apart the railings and used them to fend off the Israelis .
" I did see a number of Israeli soldiers being beaten by them . "
There were no weapons .
People wielded those bars as the Israelis tried to come aboard the ship .
He heard accounts of three Israeli soldiers being taken captive by the passengers .
The Israelis were released , because the capture produced more intense
Treated with contempt by the Israelis , he said .
Hands tied for 24 hours .
" Soldier requested that I urinate where I was . "

" The real historical plural of ' dwarf ' ( like teeth of tooth ) is dwarrows anyway : rather a nice word , but a bit too archaic .
Still I rather wish I had used the word dwarrow . "

“ White — A blank page , or canvas — his favorite .
So many … possibilities . ”
This past weekend I headed over to the Arden Theater to see their production of Sunday in the Park with George .
The musical , created by Stephen Sondheim in the 80s , is about famed artist Georges Seurat and his painting Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte .
The musical examines the artist and the people who inspired the painting , and then fast forwards 100 years to Georges ’ great - grandson , a struggling artist in his own right .
The original Broadway production was nominated for 10 Tony awards , winning in two technical categories : Best Scenic Design and Best Lighting Design .
But it ’s that scenic / lighting design that is part of what makes Sunday in the Park with George such a wonderfully unique production that demands to be seen , and appeals to us Geeks .
More after the jump …
Sunday in the Park with George is n’t an easy for a show to pull off , especially if the theater hopes to live up to the original Broadway production or the recent revival .
But that did not deter the Arden in the slightest .
Instead , they pulled out all the stops and created a production that was truly brilliant and awe inspiring .
Their production plan was so ambitious that it earned praised from Stephen Sondheim himself :
“ At a time when so many larger organizations are producing reduced forms of shows like mine and the work of other experimental theatre composers , it is heartening to know that the Arden exists .
I applaud them for their commitment to not scaling back their art , especially at this time of economic uncertainty .
I give my blessings and thanks to the Arden and everything they stand for . ”
For this production , the Arden theater called upon Jorge Cousineau , dubbed “ Philadelphia ’s theater magician ” by Philly.com .
Cousineau ’s design for Sunday in the Park with George uses nine video projectors and thirteen speakers to accomplish the task of bringing both Georges and George ’s art to life on stage before the audience ’s very eyes .
From the very beginning of the play , the audience is treated to visual spectacle .
As Georges Seurat sketches away , the large white screen behind him reveals the contents of the sketch pad .
And when he rips away the page to begin anew , so the page is “ ripped ” away from the screen .
As he describes the changes he makes to his sketch , the screen reveals those changes to the audience .
And then , of course , there ’s the creation of the famed painting itself .
We not only get to see it as it progresses , but the final work as well , all displayed by the magic of projectors and light .

As the second act begins , the audience is introduced to great - grandson George , a digital artist who has created a piece called a “ Chromolume ” that uses a machine to create images with color and light .
He is a modern version of his artistic ancestor .
And it is in this second act where Jorge Cousineau ’s design for the play really shines .
There are so many moving panels with digital projections , all perfectly in sync , interacting with the actors , and gliding across the stage .
It was at this point where I really had to pick my jaw up off the floor .
Cousineau certainly lives up to his “ Philadelphia ’s theater magician ” title , especially in this production .
I ca n’t end this review without commenting on the actors ’ performances .
After all , the best lighting in the world does not guarantee a good production .
But each and every member of the Sunday in the Park with George cast did a spectacular job .
I was particularly impressed with Kristine Fraelich , who played Dot .
Her voice was just magical .
This talented group did not have to worry about being upstaged by the special effects in the slightest .
Rather , the lighting design perfectly complimented their incredible performances .
There ’s still plenty of time to go catch a performance of the Arden theater ’s Sunday in the Park with George , as it is playing until July 4th , 2010 .
You can purchase tickets online at the Arden ’s website .
EAST HARTFORD , Conn . --
The former owner of the Hartford Whalers is planning an outdoor hockey festival that he hopes will help re-energize efforts to bring the NHL back to Connecticut .
Howard Baldwin , who moved the World Hockey League 's New England Whalers to Hartford in 1975 and brought the team into the NHL in 1979 , launched a marketing campaign Wednesday designed to bring the Whalers name , and ultimately an NHL team , back to Connecticut 's capital .
" We have got to get people talking about Hartford again when they talk about hockey , " Baldwin said .
" That stopped , and if we ever want something to happen here , we 've got to get it started again . "
Baldwin is hoping a 10 - day outdoor festival in February , based on the NHL Winter Classic , will do just that .
The " Whalers Hockey Fest , " is expected to feature up to 20 minor league , college , high school , and youth hockey games at a rink to be built at Rentschler Field , the University of Connecticut 's football stadium in East Hartford .
UConn already has signed on , and will play a doubleheader at the outdoor rink Feb. 13 .
The men will take on Sacred Heart , and the women will follow with a game against Providence , athletic director Jeff Hathaway said .
The 10 - day festival also will feature a game between Hartford Whalers alumni and former members of the Boston Bruins , Baldwin said .
Another contest , he said , will have NHL legends taking on a team of Hollywood stars called " Mystery Alaska " and based on the Baldwin - produced movie of the same name .
" We want this to be the go - to event for hockey in New England , " he said .
Baldwin also plans to reactivate the Whalers Hall of Fame , and induct new members for the first time since 1990 .
He has planned a summer " Fan Fest " that will include a celebrity golf tournament and a reunion of former Whalers players .
His plans have fans , such as 51 - year - old Joanne Cortesa of Hartford , excited .
" I have a feeling we 'll get a team within the next three years or so , " she said .
" We just need to build a new arena .
I think he 's going to get this done . "
But Baldwin has his work cut out for him .
NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said Tuesday that he could n't foresee another Whalers team in Hartford .
The franchise left Connecticut in 1997 and moved to North Carolina , where they became the Carolina Hurricanes .
The NHL did n't immediately return a phone message seeking comment about Baldwin 's announcement Wednesday .
Baldwin acknowledges that Hartford has some major obstacles to overcome .
The city 's XL Center is 35 years old , and there are no current plans for a new arena ; the minor - league Hartford Wolf Pack ranks 18th in the AHL in attendance , drawing 4,100 fans per game .
And , the city 's mayor is currently preoccupied by a corruption trial .
Other areas , including Kansas City , Winnipeg , and Quebec also are vying for NHL teams .
" The NHL is a different bird today than it was before , " Baldwin said .
" They are very careful , as they should be , about who gets in the league and who does n't , and there 's a lot of criteria that goes into it .
But if we do a great job here , they 'll come to us . "
Former Whalers captain Kevin Dineen would n't say if he believes Hartford again can support an NHL team , but said if anyone can get one to come here , he believes it is Baldwin .
" I think Howard 's a guy who over the course of his career has really done a job of connecting people and putting the pieces together that will really make any business work , " Dineen said .
" Howard is the right guy for the job . "
The French government has unveiled plans to raise the retirement age to 62 in a sweeping overhaul of the pensions system that labour unions have vowed to fight to the end .
French workers will have to pay contributions for a longer period and new taxes will be slapped on high - income earners and on capital gains to plug a gaping hole in pensions funding , labour minister Eric Woerth said .
" It is imperative that we salvage our pensions system , " Mr Woerth said as he rolled out the proposed changes , the most controversial of which is pushing back retirement from age 60 to 62 by 2018 .
" Working longer is inevitable .
There is no magical solution . "
Talk of raising the retirement age had been taboo in France where the right to stop working from age 60 has been enshrined since 1982 , a legacy of Socialist president Francois Mitterrand 's administration .
The package will allow the government to wipe out the pensions scheme 's deficit by 2018 , Mr Woerth said , with the new taxes set to haul in an extra 3.7 billion euros ( $ 5.2 billion ) in revenue .
The government is planning to extend the contributions period to 41 years and three months from 40.5 years and the retirement age will be raised gradually to 62 over the coming eight years .
" All of our partners in Europe have done it , " Mr Woerth said following a late - night meeting with French president Nicolas Sarkozy to finalise the reform package .
" It is not possible to stay on the sidelines of this movement . "
Reforming France 's pensions system is shaping up as the centrepiece of Mr Sarkozy 's agenda as he heads for a re-election battle in 2012 .
A pensions reform bill will be presented to Mr Sarkozy 's cabinet next month before heading to parliament in September .

Ok , I went to an apple store and tried to replicate the problem in 9 different iphones and nothing happened .
Signal did n't change at all and I tried to cover the antenna as much as I could with my hand .
What am I doing wrong ?
If great - grandma 's pantry contained only a bone , a handful of carrots , a couple of onions and a few potatoes left over from planting .
. . she simmered them with half a bucket of spring water and a few magical herbs from her kitchen doorstep till the tantalizing aroma lured workers from the fields and children from play .
And if the onions and potatoes were missing ( as was often the case ) , she just braised the carrots and bone with marjoram and bay and gently bubbled them with the dregs of a bottle of ketchup and some water to create a superb carrot soup .
In that spirit , assuming you have all the following ingredients ( leftovers or otherwise ) , here 's how to whip up a healthy French country cousin of vichyssoise .
( Good Woman 's Thick Soup )
1 chicken carcass or chicken bones with some meat left on them
2 large potatoes , thinly peeled and cut into 1 " chunks or unpeeled and cut into 1/2 " chunks
2 medium leeks , cut vertically , washed and cut into 1 " pieces
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried or 1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh marjoram
1/2 teaspoon dried or 1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh basil
1/4 teaspoon coarsely , freshly ground pepper
4 cups water
2 cups milk and salt to taste
Put everything but the milk into a Dutch oven or large kettle .
Cover , bring to a boil , reduce heat and simmer one hour .
Cool , remove chicken bones , pick off the meat and return it to the kettle .
Whizz the soup — two cupfuls at a time — in a blender or whip it vigorously in the pot with an eggbeater till the individual ingredients nearly disappear .
Reheat the mixture to just boiling and add the milk .
Stir , taste and add more salt if needed .
If you 're in a hungry hurry , do n't bother with the blender or eggbeater .
Just take out the bones and serve the golden , aromatic broth generously filled with bites of chicken , potato and leek with squares of pale green leek tops floating on top .
Either way , the soup — with garlic toast , cheese and fresh apples — should make a meal for six people .
But suppose — instead of meat or even bones — you have on hand only half a cup of meat drippings and fat , a lone turnip , the tired core of a former brisk bunch of celery , some leeks and potatoes ?
Shall you despair of becoming famous for the soup you serve tonight ?
Not at all . . . rejoice !
You have just the very ingredients for :
Potage Parisienne
2 tablespoons meat fat or cooking oil
1 onion , 1 leek or the tops of 2 or 3 leeks , chopped
1 carrot , chopped
1 large potato , thinly peeled and diced or just diced
5 or 6 red radishes or 1 small turnip , diced
4 cups boiling water
1/2 teaspoon salt or as needed
1/8 teaspoon black pepper , freshly ground
1/2 teaspoon dried or 1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh basil
1 to 2 cups milk
Lightly sauté the onion or the leek in the melted fat or oil till just transparent .
Add the other vegetables , meat drippings , water and seasonings .
Cover and cook on low heat for 20 minutes .
Add the milk and reheat just to steaming .
Garnish with chopped , fresh parsley .
Serves four to six .
By the way , Virginia , there really is a chicken foot soup .
It does n't have a great deal of flavor but it is protein and calcium - rich .
On its own it 's a light , little first course broth and it can become stock for borsch , cabbage soup , turnip chowder or even the famous vichyssoise .
Chicken Foot Soup
2 pairs of chicken feet
1 stalk of celery with leaves , chopped
1 whole leek , sliced vertically , cleaned and chopped
1 bay leaf
1/2 teaspoon dried tarragon
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon salt
3 black peppercorns
1 tablespoon white wine or apple vinegar
2 to 3 cups water
Cover the washed chicken feet with boiling water , then take them out one by one ; clip off their nails , peel away the skin and put them back into the liquid .
Add the vegetables and more water to cover all , bring to a rapid boil , reduce heat and simmer in covered pot for 1 - 1/ 2 hours .
Serves two or three .
For most purposes , just remove what 's left of the feet when the soup is done . . . but for vichyssoise , strain the broth .
For a soup or broth with more color and flavor , include the chicken 's back and wing tips .
For a more filling dish , add one - quarter cup of whole barley , rye grits , or brown rice .
The flavor of this soup can also be improved by adding the juice of half a lemon after cooking , at serving time .
Garnish with a thin lemon slice in each bowl .

Basic Chicken Broth
Our Pilgrim foremothers took chicken broth to sick people , fed it to babies , and willed it to us .
Full of assorted , easily digested proteins , vitamins and minerals , it goes to work the moment it enters the body to nourish it , warm the heart , stimulate a healthy appetite , and satisfy a weak one .
Put chicken bones , onion and / or leek pieces , about one cup chopped celery with tops , one diced carrot , 1 / 2 teaspoon each of dried basil , marjoram and tarragon , a teaspoon of salt , three peppercorns , four cups of water , and one tablespoon of white wine or apple vinegar into a pot .
Cover the container and bring its contents to a boil , then reduce the heat and simmer 1 1/2 hours .
Strain the broth through cheesecloth or a fine mesh strainer .
Makes about four cups .
For stock , remove the bones , retain the meat and vegetables .
Chicken Consommé
Chill strained broth .
Skim off the fat and use it to make gravy .
Reheat the broth and serve in bowls with a basket of toast or crackers and thin slices of lemon rafting little sprigs of fresh parsley .
Cabbage Soup
Make either chicken foot soup or the basic chicken broth .
Take out the bones .
Put in a cupful of chopped cabbage , peeled thinly sliced broccoli stems , chopped mustard greens , kale , or a combination of any of these .
Cook on medium heat 10 minutes , or until the greens are tender .
When I 've already used all the leek or green onion tops in some brave potage or green salad , when the weather turns hot and when something colorful and spicy is coming up later in the meal . . . then I think of vichyssoise .
Perhaps its elegance is mostly bravado — a pale potato soup , dressing up and playing Empress — but it does slide coolly down a parched throat .
It 's good hot , too .
Vichyssoise ( Potato Soup )
2 tablespoons safflower oil
3 leeks , white part only , minced
1 medium - size white onion , minced
3 large potatoes , peeled and thinly sliced
4 cups clear , strained chicken broth
1 1/2 cups cream , or cream alternate * ( directions follow )
Salt and pepper to taste
Sprinkle of mace or nutmeg
About 1 tablespoon chopped chives
Sauté and stir the leeks and onions in the oil for three minutes .
Add the potatoes and broth , cover and simmer till tender ( about 15 minutes ) .
Puree with eggbeater or blender .
Stir in cream or cream alternate , salt and pepper .
* Cream Alternate : one cup instant powdered milk mixed with one cup whole milk .
This cuts down the cost of the soup , while maintaining its consistency and flavor . . . and cholesterol counters can eat the vichyssoise with assurance .
You can also use half - and - half cream as an alternative .
Garnish each bowlful with a sprinkling of mace or nutmeg and / or a few pinches of chopped chives .
Vichyssoise is good hot but , to be deliciously authentic , should be served cold .
Really chill it . . . one to three hours in the refrigerator or a few minutes in the freezer .
A skillful , penny - pinching epicure can bless several meals with one chicken .
First meal : fried drumsticks , thighs and wings ; second meal : the precooked breasts in chicken pie , in a salad , with curried rice or creamed on buttermilk biscuits ; third : a potage made with stock from bones of the above pieces plus neck and back ; fourth : Creme Caroline , a soup made with a stock from the giblets and any chicken morsels left .
Creme Caroline
2 shallots or white parts of 3 or 4 green onions ( use the green tops in a salad to go with the soup )
2 cups stock made of chicken gizzard and heart , neck & back simmered with celery , onion , bay leaf , tarragon , salt & pepper
Chopped gizzards and hearts plus meat from neck and back ( 1/2 to 1 cup of meat altogether )
1 teaspoon additional tarragon leaves
1 cup coffee cream
Assemble all the ingredients except the cream in a heavy , covered kettle .
Bring to a boil , reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes .
Stir in the cream slowly so it wo n't curdle .
Serve at once , to two people .
Turnip Chowder
2 tablespoons chicken fat or oil
1 small onion , diced
2 small white turnips , diced
1 medium - size potato , peeled and diced
2 cups chicken stock , or giblet stock as in Creme Caroline
2 cups milk
salt to taste
Gently saute and stir the onion in the fat until the diced pieces are transparent .
Add , and continue to stir and fry the turnips till they 're lightly browned .
Add the potatoes and stock , bring to a boil , reduce heat and simmer covered 10 - 15 minutes .
Stir in milk and reheat to simmering , taste and add salt and pepper as necessary .
Turnip chowder can also be made with veal or pork stock , or — lacking any stock or bones — bacon or salt pork .
Brown the diced bacon or pork , strain out the solid pieces and reserve for a garnish .
Saute the onions and turnips with a sprinkling of thyme or marjoram ( 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon ) .
Add potatoes , one teaspoon salt and two cups ( or enough to cover all ) boiling water .
Simmer with a lid on the kettle for 15 to 20 minutes , then stir in one cup milk .
Let rest , covered , off heat for 5 minutes .
Serves four .
When sorrel — the " sour grass " with spearhead leaves — is growing abundantly , one can vary the menu with a green soup made with unstrained stock from veal bones , chicken foot soup or basic chicken stock ( dark green lettuce leaves can be used with the sorrel ) .
Green Soup
2 tablespoons cooking oil
2 or 3 green onions , thinly sliced
4 cups stock or broth
1 large potato , peeled and shredded
1 cup tightly packed washed , chopped sorrel leaves
1 teaspoon salt
Stir and sauté the onions lightly in the oil for three minutes .
Add the stock and shredded potato , bring to a boil and simmer — uncovered — for five minutes .
Add the sorrel , cover and cook one minute ( the grass should be limp but still flavorful ) .
Serves four .
Whenever I make a pumpkin pie , I always seem to wind up with more pulp than the recipe calls for .
Here are two ways to use up one - half or one cup of pumpkin most deliciously :
Pumpkin Potage
1 cup canned or cooked pumpkin purée
2 cups rich chicken stock with meat from the bones
2 tablespoons potato flour or cornstarch
1 cup milk or half - and - half
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
Salt to taste
Blend together and heat the pumpkin and chicken stock .
Mix the potato flour or cornstarch with a little of the milk or cream and add it to the soup as you stir .
Continue stirring and , as the mixture thickens , slowly pour in the remaining milk or cream .
Salt to taste and garnish each bowlful with a pinch or two of parsley .
Serves four .
Quick Little Pumpkin Soup
1/2 cup pumpkin purée
2 bouillon cubes dissolved in 1/2 cup boiling water
2 cups milk
1/2 teaspoon tarragon , dried
1/2 to 1 teaspoon curry powder
1 tablespoon fresh parsley
Blend all the ingredients and heat just to steaming but do not boil .
Cover , remove from heat , and let rest three to five minutes .
Serves two , in cups .
For soups and stews featuring beef bones , the neck bones and shank rounds are number one .
They have enough meat on them to provide the main course for a meal as well as to " beef - up " the soup stock .
The shank rounds can serve as mini - pot roasts , yielding as a bonus a rich , gelatiny stock containing calcium and marrow from the bones ' centers .
Beef loves spices ( cloves , cumin seeds , coriander ) and heartily flavored herbs ( especially garlic , marjoram or oregano and bay ) .
It also responds to the tenderizing and flavoring of red wine or wine vinegar .
Basic Beef Stock & Dinner
2 lbs. each beef neck bones and shank rounds
2 onions , quartered
3 to 5 carrots , cut into 1 " pieces
3 celery stalks , cut into 1 " pieces
2 fat cloves of garlic , whole
2 bay leaves
4 to 6 cloves
6 peppercorns
1 teaspoon dried marjoram leaves
3 teaspoons salt
6 cups water
1/4 cup wine vinegar or 1 / 2 to 1 cup red wine
4 large potatoes , peeled and halved
Heat your largest , heaviest kettle or Dutch oven and grease the bottom by rubbing it with the fattest side of a shank round .
Add a little oil if necessary and brown the shank rounds , then the neck bones .
Then put in one - third of the vegetables ( but no potatoes ) and all the spices and herbs .
Pour the water and wine over all .
As soon as the liquid boils , reduce the heat , add the remaining vegetables ( except for the potatoes ) , and cook the rich mixture for three to five hours .
By then the meat will have left the bones , the gristle melted into the broth , and the calcium will have leached out of the bones and into the stock .
During the last hour of cooking , add a potato and salt to the pot for each person expected for dinner .
When the potatoes are tender , take them out with a large spoon and use a slotted spoon to put the meat on a platter .
With three tablespoons of the fat from the top of the stock , three tablespoons of flour , a cup of the broth , and about one - half teaspoon of additional salt , make a gravy to go with the potatoes .
Serve the remaining stock as soup , or reserve it — along with any leftover meat — to use in a future soup .
Fast Borsch
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
1 carrot , shredded
1 onion , diced
5 or 6 young beets with tops , or 1 small can diced beets
2 cups beef stock or 1 can beef consommé
1 raw potato , finely diced
1 teaspoon marjoram
1 tablespoon fresh , chopped parsley
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup sour cream
Lightly sauté the carrot and onion in the butter .
Add everything else except the cream .
Bring to a boil , reduce heat , simmer covered for 20 minutes , stir , ladle into bowls , and garnish each with a dollop of sour cream .
Serves three or four .
Quick Minestrone
Lightly saute :
2 tablespoons cooking oil
1 onion , chopped
1 clove of garlic , sliced
Add to the above :
4 cups beef stock
4 peeled and chopped or 1 can stewed tomatoes
1 cup leftover beans or 1 can mixed salad beans
1/2 cup macaroni or spaghetti ( uncooked )
1 teaspoon Italian herbs
1/2 cup each chopped cabbage and celery with tops
Bring to a boil , reduce heat , simmer covered about 15 minutes , taste and add salt & herbs as needed .
During the last 5 minutes you can add bits of leftover vegetables such as whole kernel corn , zucchini , peas , or green beans .
The herbs and a few minutes simmering will marry all the flavors .
Serves eight .
Of course it 's possible to make any of these potages and soups — or at least a pale - flavored and less nourishing version — with a bouillon cube and a cup of water in place of each cup of stock .
It 's also possible to add a little more flavor and some nourishment by browning bacon or salt pork , sautéing the onion in the fat , and putting the browned meat bits back into , or onto , the soup .
You probably also know that a handful of oatmeal thickens and adds protein to meatless potages and stews and that soy flour — stirred into a little of the liquid , then into the pot — absorbs floating fat and adds protein .
But to really give soul to a soup , you must always add a little meat , gelatin from dissolved gristle , and calcium from bones .
It does n't take much else , in a pinch , to produce a masterpiece .
For instance , if you have a bone , an onion , and a handful of herbs , a hunk of some pale - looking dried - up cheese and a few slices of stale French or sourdough bread . . . you have all you need to make a dish so tantalizing in aroma , so friendly to the palate , and so satisfying to the body and spirit of mankind that people in Paris go down before daybreak to the messy , noisy , busy wholesale vegetable market — Les Halles — to get it .
French Onion Soup
2 tablespoons cooking oil or meat fat
1 very large or 2 medium onions , sliced
Bones from two veal steaks , pork chops , or whatever with leftover meat
6 cups water
1 bay leaf
1 teaspoon dried or 1 1/ 2 teaspoons fresh marjoram , minced
Toasted day - old bread , one slice for each bowl
1/2 cup grated cheese
Brown the onions while stirring them in oil on medium heat .
If some of the strands blacken , do n't worry .
This soup is good no matter what happens to it , short of overheating the grease or burning all the onions .
( If you sprinkle the marjoram on the onions while browning you can enjoy the aroma as you stir . )
Add all the other ingredients , except bread and cheese .
Cover the kettle and simmer 25 minutes or so .
Remove bones , detach meat , and put it ( the meat ) back into the broth .
Place a slice of lightly toasted bread topped with cheese into each bowl and proudly ladle the soup over it .
Voila !
Serves three or four .
Onion soup can be made with either chicken or strained beef stock .
It also gets along quite well without the cheese , or when thickened by sprinkling two or three tablespoons of flour over the onions as they finish browning .
You can even enjoy another variation by adding one - half to three - quarters cup of cream to the basic recipe .
Fish Head Soup Dinner
Any fisherman or fish market will usually give you all the fish heads you will carry away .
To two pounds of the heads , tails and bones , add :
4 to 6 cups of water
1 large bay leaf
1/2 teaspoon dried basil leaves
1 onion or leek , chopped
1 stalk diced celery or 1/2 teaspoon celery seed
1 teaspoon salt
4 peppercorns or 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar or apple vinegar
Bring everything to a boil , reduce heat , and simmer covered till the meat falls off the fish bones at a touch .
Then strain the stock through cheesecloth or a fine - mesh strainer and throw away whatever 's left after straining ( all the flavor and nourishment is in the stock now ) .
To this stock add :
3/4 cup tomato juice ( 6 oz . can )
2 small cloves of minced garlic
1 large potato , cut into thin slices
Cook the whole mixture 10 minutes or until the potatoes are tender and — with a slotted spoon — remove the potato slices to a warmed platter .
Keep the plate warm while you slip an egg into the broth for each person .
Poach the eggs , tenderly lift them out , arrange them with the potato slices and garnish the platter with fresh parsley sprigs .
Chop up some more sprigs and sprinkle them on the soup after it is poured into bowls , over slices of toast .
Mrs. Adams ' New England Fish Chowder
2 tablespoons oil or 2 or 3 slices bacon or 2 oz .
diced salt pork
1 large onion , diced
2 cups ( 1 or 2 ) potatoes , peeled and diced
1 pound fish fillets ( cod , perch , or halibut ) cut into 1 " pieces
2 cups water
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups milk
3 drops hot sauce
Brown and reserve bacon or salt pork , then gently fry the onion in the pork fat or oil .
Add the potatoes , water , salt and fish chunks , bring to a boil , cover , and simmer on low heat 20 minutes ( or till fish flakes easily with a fork and potatoes are tender ) .
Add the milk and hot sauce .
Garnish with bacon or salt pork bits , or — if you began with oil — sprinkle the soup with minced fresh parsley or basil leaves .
Bouillabaisse ( French Fish Chowder )
A bouillabaisse needs three categories of ingredients and — if you improvise within these categories — you 'll be keeping faith with epicurean French seaport soup - making ( and eating well for next to nothing if you can harvest your own seafoods ) .
(1) The bouillee : oil ( olive preferred ) , green peppers , celery and — absolutely — tomatoes .
(2) The herbs : marjoram , basil , thyme ( fresh if you have even a pot and window sill garden ) .
(3) The fishes : the traditional ideal collection is ( a ) a rock fish , ( b ) a bottom feeder , ( c ) assorted free swimmers put in whole if too small to fillet and ( d ) various shellfish .
You may use red snapper , halibut , sea perch , sea trout , sea bass , cod — or any available combination — - with crab or lobster and mussels or clams , scrubbed and in their shells .
How to Build a A Bouillabaisse a la Marseille
FIRST , PREPARE THE SEA CREATURES .
Scrub the clams and — if you dug them yourself — keep them in clean sea water 24 to 48 hours while they spit out the sand they contain .
( You can encourage this cleansing by feeding the clams a handful of cornmeal or oatmeal each morning , after changing their water .
Or hang them in a mesh bag from a dock or tow them behind your boat for two days . )
As long as the mollusks close their shells when you touch them , they 're alive , alive , oh ! and edible .
A rock crab is killed by dipping it in rapidly boiling water ( hold it by the shell , so that its claws can't grab you ) .
Pull off the back , wash the " mustard " out , break the body in half and pull off the claws .
Clean small fish and scale or skin , clean , and fillet the large ones .
Cut the fillets into serving - size pieces .
SECOND , PREPARE THE VEGETABLES AND ASSEMBLE THE HERBS .
Trim the stem end out of the green pepper and cut the vegetable into 1 " pieces .
Briefly immerse the whole tomatoes in boiling water and then remove their loosened skins .
THIRD , ASSEMBLE THE BOUILLABAISSE :
In a large , deep , straight - sided kettle put :
1/2 cup olive oil
1 large onion , diced
1 leek , sliced
4 large cloves of garlic , sliced
1 teaspoon marjoram
Sauté just till the onion is golden , while you stir occasionally and add :
3 large peeled and diced tomatoes , or 1 can stewed tomatoes
1 sprig fresh fennel
3 sprigs fresh or 2 teaspoons dried parsley
1 strip ( about 1/ 2 " x 2 " ) of orange orange peel , without white
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon fresh , ground pepper
On top of these ingredients : place :
1 lb. perch fillets
1 lb. halibut steak
1 lb. cod fillet
1 lb. red snapper
2 or 3 rock crabs
12 oysters
12 to 24 steamed clams
Pour in enough boiling water* to completely cover the fish and add a generous pinch of saffron .
Boil , covered , 15 minutes or till the fish flakes easily ( but does not lose its shape ) and the oysters and clams have opened .
Divide the fish and shellfish among 10 to 12 soup plates , with a piece of hard bread or toast in each .
Pour the soup over the bread and deal out the plates .
If Mother Earth has presented you with lamb 's - quarters or samphire during your seashore explorations , or if the edge of the sea has yielded limpets or whelks , toss them into the bouillabaisse , too , during the last five minutes of cooking .
Only foraged goose tongue should go in with the tomatoes , celery etc. for a full 15 minutes ' cooking .
This last recipe — for the making of a bouillabaisse — sums up all the principles of penny - pinching epicurean cooking :
Use even little bits of good food and combine herbs , vegetable and whatever meats or bones are available so that they supplement each other 's flavors and food value .
Great - grandma B. gave us some wise words on the subject : Waste not , want not . . . and do n't throw out the bones .

For decades small business owners have been telling anyone who would listen that they need health - care reforms that lower costs .
But President Obama and his allies in Congress pushed through a law that will dramatically raise health - care costs and increase the overall cost of doing business .

PASCAGOULA , Miss . --
William Mahan bends over a bowl of raw shrimp and inhales deeply , using his left hand to wave the scent up toward his nose .
Deep breath .
Exhale .
Repeat .
He clears his palate with a bowl of freshly cut watermelon before moving on to raw oysters .
Deep breath .
Exhale .
Repeat .
He 's one of about 40 inspectors trained recently at a federal fisheries lab in Pascagoula , Miss. , to sniff out seafood tainted by oil in the Gulf of Mexico and make sure the product reaching consumers is safe to eat .
But with thousands of fishermen bringing in catch at countless docks across the four - state region , the task of inspectors , both sniffers and others , is daunting .
It 's certainly not fail - safe .
The first line of defense began with closing a third of federal waters to fishing and hundreds more square - miles of state waters .
Now comes the nose .
Mahan is an agricultural extension director with the University of Florida based in Apalachicola , where some of the world 's most famous oysters are culled .
" We 're being trained to detect different levels of taint , which in this case is oil , " Mahan said last week .
" We started out sniffing different samples of oil to sort of train our noses and minds to recognize it . "
So what does an oily fish smell like ?
" Well , it has an oil odor to it , " Mahan said .
" Everyone has a nose they bring to it ...
Everybody 's nose works differently .
For me , the oysters are a little more challenging . "
The human nose has been used for centuries to aid in making wine , butter and cheese , and is a highly efficient and trustworthy tool , said Brian Gorman with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , which is hosting the courses along with the nonprofit Battle Creek , Mich . - based International Food Protection Training Institute .
" Properly trained noses are really remarkable organs , " Gorman said .
Even so , inspectors can't be everywhere .
The trained sniffers will be deployed where needed , when suspicions are raised about seafood being illegally culled from closed waters , or even to test fish from open waters .
No agency has yet reported finding or stopping any tainted seafood from getting to market .
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has also been sampling seafood both in closed and open waters , and sending it off for chemical testing , with more than 600 fish and shrimp processed to date .
State and local inspectors are fanning out across the region to docks , seafood processors and restaurants , some now armed with specially trained noses .
NOAA currently has 55 inspectors at its Mississippi lab , with another 55 in training .
" The message we 're delivering is simple :
The seafood in your grocery store or local restaurant is safe to eat , and that goes for seafood harvested from the Gulf , " said Kevin Griffis of the U.S. Department of Commerce .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also has a role with its own inspectors , though the agency said it only has " several seafood specialists " currently in the Gulf area .
" We are ramping up inspections at facilities in the region , " said FDA spokeswoman Meghan Scott , adding that inspectors would be present at seafood processors throughout the Gulf states .
She said the agency has deployed a mobile lab to Florida that is testing samples of fish caught in waters not yet believed to be impacted by oil , because fish do n't stay in one place .
Gulf fishermen are already hurting from the perception that their product is tainted , said Ewell Smith , executive director of the Louisiana Seafood Promotion and Marketing Board .
" Some people also just think we 're shut down altogether , " Smith said , adding that higher prices for shrimp are causing smaller businesses to cancel orders simply because they can't afford it .
Smith said no oily seafood will ever make it to market .
" You 're going to smell it , you 're going to see it .
It would be almost impossible for it to make it to market , " he said .
Fishermen say they can't sell a tainted product anyway , whether it is inspected or not .
Earlier in the week , fishermen brought in thousands of pounds of shrimp caught off Louisiana to the docks at Port Christian , Miss. , where the catch was offloaded and sold to processors and customers on site .
No inspectors were present .
" No oil , not even a drop , " said fishermen Mike Nguyen , who brought in 3,000 pounds of shrimp on Wednesday .
" When the shrimp get oily , they die and they stink , " he said .
" See , they 're alive . "
Joe Jenkins owns Crystal Seas Seafood Company on the docks at Pass Christian .
He 'll be buying thousands of pounds of shrimp .
" Here , we do n't have inspectors on any level so we have to inspect our own seafood products to make sure they 're safe and oil - free and good to eat , " Jenkins said .
" We 're not going to have inspectors everywhere .
Everybody 's got to do their own job ... to make sure they do n't have a problem with oily shrimp whatsoever . "
Mississippi shrimper Richard Bosarge agreed , and said no one wants to sell oily shrimp .
" If we catch oily shrimp , the nets are coming up , " Bosarge said shortly before heading out to sea .
He called the sniffers " ridiculous . "
" They 're going to smell it ?
No way , " added Mike Triana , who works for a Mississippi gas company along the coast .
" How they gonna know ?
I ai n't eating any of it .
I do n't trust the nose . "
Gerald Wojtala , director of the International Food Protection Training Institute , acknowledged that nosing around seafood may sound silly , but said it 's a time - proven technique .
" The human nose has been used on a lot of ( oil ) spill response , " Wojtala said .
" There are a lot of sophisticated tests , but when you think about it , do you want to run a test that takes seven days and costs thousands of dollars ?
" This saves a lot of time and money , " he added , " and it puts more eyes and noses at different points in the system . "
Still , Wojtala said , nothing is fail - safe .
Even without an oil spill , people sometimes get sick from tainted seafood , or suffer illnesses from contamination in red meat such as E. coli .
" It 's safe to say there is no 100 - percent guarantee , " he said .
" There 's never a 100 - percent guarantee .
We can only be as safe as we can be . "

Research led by Liwei Chen , MD , PhD , Assistant Professor of Public Health at LSU Health Sciences Center New Orleans , has found that there is an association between sugary drinks and blood pressure and that by cutting daily consumption of sugary drinks by just one serving a day , people can lower their blood pressure .
The research is published online in Circulation : Journal of the American Heart Association .
" We found no association for diet beverage consumption or caffeine intake and blood pressure , " notes Dr. Chen , " suggesting that sugar may actually be the nutrient that is associated with blood pressure and not caffeine which many people would suspect . "
The research , which was supported by a grant from the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health , analyzed dietary intake and blood pressure of 810 adults measured at baseline , 6 and 18 months .
After known risk factors of high blood pressure were controlled for , a reduction in sugar - sweetened beverage consumption of one serving per day was associated with a drop of 1.8 mm Hg in systolic pressure and 1.1 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure over 18 months .
After additional adjustment for weight change over the same period , a reduction in the consumption of sugar - sweetened beverages was still significantly associated with blood pressure reduction .
" By reducing the amount of sugar in your diet , you are also reducing the number of calories you consume and may lose weight , " adds Dr. Chen .
" But even among those whose weight was stable , we still found that people who drank fewer sugary sodas lowered their blood pressure . "
Elevated blood pressure continues to be one of the most common and important problems in the United States .
According to the American Heart Association , about 74.5 million people in the United States , or one in three people , age 20 and older have high blood pressure .
It is estimated that high blood pressure killed 56,561 Americans in 2006 .
From 1996 to 2006 , the death rate from high blood pressure increased 19.5 percent , and the actual number of deaths rose 48.1 percent .
Normal blood pressure , measured in millimeters of mercury , is defined as systolic ( top number ) less than 120 and diastolic ( bottom number ) less than 80 .
High blood pressure ( hypertension ) is a systolic pressure of 140 or higher and a diastolic pressure of 90 or higher .
Pressures falling in the range between are considered to be prehypertension .
High blood pressure , which usually has few symptoms , if any , is an established risk factor for stroke , cardiovascular disease , kidney failure , and shortened life expectancy .
" More research is needed to establish the causal relationship , but in the meantime , people can benefit right now by reducing their intake of sugary drinks by at least one serving per day , " concludes Dr. Chen .

Major Czech parties suffer massive election losses
By Markus Salzmann
3 June 2010
The conservative Citizens Party ( ODS ) and the Social Democratic Party ( CSSD ) have suffered massive losses in recent parliamentary elections in the Czech Republic .
Four years ago the ODS was still the largest party , with 35.4 percent of the vote , but its vote fell to just 20 percent in the general election held on May 28 - 29 .
The CSSD vote dropped from 32.3 percent to 22 percent .
The election turnout was 62.2 percent , two percent lower than in 2006 .
The Christian People ’s Party ( KDU - CSL ) and the Greens ( SZ ) , which had formed a coalition government with the Conservatives after the 2006 elections , found little support among voters .
Both parties failed to pass the five percent hurdle and neither is now represented in parliament .
Voters have turned their backs on the major parties , responding to the widespread corruption and unprincipled haggling of the political elite , which has involved not only the conservative parties , but also the Social Democrats and the Communist Party ( KSCM ) .
In the elections , the successors of the former Stalinist state party had campaigned for a coalition with the Social Democrats of the CSSD .
In the recent period there has not been a stable government in Prague .
The conservative prime minister , Mirek Topolanek , resigned a year ago when his minority government , which was dependent on the votes of several defectors from the Social Democrats , lost its majority .
Since then , a so - called non-partisan “ cabinet of experts ” has ruled under Jan Fischer .
This situation has been characterized by paralysis and conflict between the various parliamentary factions .
The losses of the major parties have benefited two newly created right - wing parties : TOP 09 ( the abbreviation stands for tradition , responsibility , prosperity ) and VV ( Public Affairs ) .
Both have managed to enter parliament on their first attempt .
With 16.8 percent , TOP 09 was the third - strongest party , pushing the Communist Party into fourth place with 11.3 percent .
VV accounted for 10.9 percent of the vote .
TOP 09 is led by 72 - year - old Karel Schwarzenberg , the head of an extended old Bohemian aristocratic family which owns many castles and forests in the Czech Republic , Austria and Germany .
He is a multimillionaire and a practicing Catholic .
Before the so - called “ Velvet Revolution ” which resulted in the departure of the Stalinist regime , Schwarzenberg had spent 40 years in exile in Bavaria and Austria .
In 1990 , he was bureau chief for Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel .
In 2007 , the Green Party nominated him as foreign minister in the Green - Conservative coalition .
In the recent election campaign , Schwarzenberg called for ruthless cost- cutting measures to close the state deficit .
VV ( Vecie Verejné ) is the creation of the populist television presenter Radek John , who has made a name for himself particularly through exposing cases of corruption .
In the election campaign , like Schwarzenberg , he too called for more budgetary discipline and won many votes by promising to conduct a “ fight against corruption . ”
The losses of the major parties have led to a series of resignations .
The most prominent victim was Social Democratic Party leader Jiri Paroubek , whose sudden resignation has ushered in a new round of leadership struggles in the CSSD .
The leaders of the Greens , Ondrej Liska , and the Christian People ’s Party , Cyril Svoboda , also announced their resignations after the election , as did former Social Democratic Prime Minister Milos Zeman , who had campaigned under a new party banner , Civil Rights ( SPOZ ) , but failed to make any headway .
For the Communist Party , whose vote dropped slightly compared to 2006 , the election could be a turning point .
Their campaign was preceded by a violent internal conflict over the course the party should take , in which the right wing was able to push through collaboration with the CSSD .
A breakup of the party is now quite possible .
Despite their heavy losses , the Social Democrats still emerged as the strongest party in the elections .
But the result was not enough to form a government with the Communist Party .
It is now fairly certain that the conservative ODS will form a new government coalition with TOP 09 and VV , and ODS chairman Petr Necas began negotiations to this end last weekend .
Together , the three parties hold 118 of the 200 seats in parliament .
That would be the largest majority of any government since the founding of the Czech Republic in 1993 .
The main task of the new government will be to overcome the previous weak leadership in the implementation of further “ reforms . ”
ODS , TOP 09 and VV have all called for economic reforms and austerity measures .
Spending cuts will be implemented in order to balance the budget .
Necas has said that under his leadership , the Czech Republic will not slip into crisis , like Greece .
In 2009 , the Czech economy shrank by 4.1 percent and experts believe that the crisis is not over yet .
In particular , the auto industry , which accounts for a large part of the Czech Republic ’s economic performance , faces further cutbacks in production .
Rising unemployment would follow , pushing up spending on welfare .
The projected budget deficit for this year of 5.3 percent of GDP is to be considerably reduced .
The same applies to the state debt , which by European standards is relatively low at 38 percent of GDP .
The focus of the attacks is on the health care and pension schemes , which , unlike other Eastern European countries , have not been completely destroyed .
Representatives of big business expressed their satisfaction over the outcome of the poll .
“ These elections point to decisive action being taken on the budget and pension reforms , ” said analyst Timothy Ash of the Royal Bank of Scotland .
The German business daily Handelsblatt clearly expressed what is expected from the new government : “ Given the crisis , the present situation is anything but rosy .
Even the Czech Republic faces inevitable budget cuts — and that requires a government that dares to implement these changes in practice . ”
The massive loss of votes by the two major parties , which in the past two decades have dominated Czech politics and carried out essentially the same anti-social policies , and the short lifespan of the Greens make it clear how far advanced the political crisis is in the Czech Republic .
A right - wing government in Prague carrying through social attacks will inevitably come into conflict with wide layers of the population .
Already the previous attacks of the non-partisan government leader Jan Fischer and his conservative predecessor led to considerable opposition and the growth of social and political tensions .
In 2008 , thousands of public service workers , teachers , truck drivers , pensioners , doctors and nurses took to the streets in protest against the cuts in social spending .
In March this year , a public transport strike was prevented only by the efforts of the unions .
A nearly 40 - year - old board game is getting a lot of new attention because of eerie similarities between the scenarios of its play and the 78 - day - old BP Gulf oil disaster .
The game BP Offshore Oil Strike , which came out in the 1970s and is adorned with an old BP logo , revolves around four players exploring for oil , building platforms and constructing pipelines - all in the name of being the first to make $ 120 million .
But like the real - life oil game there are some big hazards , too .
Players have to deal with the possibility of large - scale oil spills and cover cleanup costs .
You struggle with " hazard cards " that include phrases now part of our daily vernacular , including : " Blow - out !
Rig damaged .
Oil slick cleanup costs .
Pay $ 1 million . "
Sound a little familiar ?
The similarity has led to discussions all over the Web .
It 's prompted people to dig in their attics and put their old games up on eBay - many of which have promptly been snatched up .
One copy of the game was donated to the largest toy museum in England , the House on the Hill Toy Museum in Stansted , Essex .
The museum 's owner , Alan Goldsmith , told CNN he was shocked when he saw the donated game .
" It was sort of uncanny how it was similar to what 's happening really , " Goldsmith said .
" I thought it was odd that it was a game in the ' 70s , which has basically now come true .
The interesting thing is that it was in dollars , even though it was a European game .
The cleanup bill was $ 1 million , which we now know is n't nearly enough , but it is a weird colorful circle . "
The game came out during the oil crisis of the ' 70s - and perhaps it was an attempt to drum up support for U.S. - based drilling .
Goldsmith said as a part of the game , players work to amass a drilling empire .
But the game comes with all of the scenarios of the present Gulf disaster .
Even the game board and cover resemble images from the Gulf these days - with rigs attempting to reach far into the ocean depths .
The game has many people online remarking about whether it eerily foreshadowed the current BP disaster .
" It 's strange , you 've got this fictitious board game with fictitious drama - but it could n't be any closer to the reality of what 's happening now , " Goldsmith said .
The world of video games , meanwhile , appears to have a more direct link to the Gulf oil disaster .
In " Crisis in the Gulf , " which an independent producer released last month for the Xbox , gamers use weapons to zap blobs of oil .
The game is available for purchase through Xbox 's online marketplace .
Competition in the wireless industry is heating up with the recent launch of several new carriers , but critics say Canadians are still facing at least one big barrier to choice — locked phones — and a new copyright bill expected to be introduced this week could make matters worse .
Mobile phones are typically sold by wireless providers in Canada with a digital lock programmed into them that prevents the owner from using the device on a different carrier 's network .
This has n't been much of an issue for years since the networks of Canada 's big three cellphone companies —
Bell , Rogers and Telus — were generally incompatible anyway .
But in November , Bell and Telus jointly launched a new 3G High - Speed Packet Access network that is compatible with the one Rogers runs , while a pair of new carriers that have started up since December — Wind Mobile and Mobilicity — use the same technology as the other .
Coupled with the ability to take a phone number along when changing providers , which Canadians have been able to do since 2007 , consumers now have more ability to switch for a better deal than ever before .
However , Canadian carriers are still ordering their suppliers to lock phones .
" It 's a standard industry practice and when we bought the handset , the manufacturer asked if we wanted it , and we said , ' Sure , ' " said Mobilicity president Dave Dobbin at the carrier 's launch earlier this month .
Canadians can still unlock their phone through several methods , such as independent phone dealers found in many malls , but it often incurs an additional charge and voids the warranty on the device .
Doing so is currently legal under Canadian law and most carriers will happily provide service to customers who bring in their own unlocked devices .
Locking protects subsidies
Marc Choma , spokesman for the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association , says locking is done to protect the carrier 's investment in the devices .
Carriers typically give customers a hefty discount on their handset in exchange for a contractual commitment of one , two or three years .
" If you 're getting a phone for zero dollars but the phone is actually $ 700 , that 's exactly why the locking is there , " he said .
Rogers spokeswoman Odette Coleman said there are also non-financial reasons for the locks .
" We do n't unlock them for customers or provide tech support for them because we did not certify those devices on our network and cannot guarantee how they will perform , " she said .
" The devices … go through the rigorous process of certifying so we can provide technical support and guarantee that they will perform . "
Wind Mobile at first sold unlocked phones but began locking once it was discovered that people were buying devices at cost and reselling them on eBay for a profit , a source in the company says .
According to Wind 's website , phones are being locked " for now . "
However , consumer advocates say all carriers are inserting locks for no other reason than to keep customers from switching .
The locks are a form of double dipping , according to the Public Interest Advocacy Centre ( PIAC ) consumer watchdog group , because carriers already charge steep early cancellation charges on contracts , which are designed to cover outstanding phone subsidies .
Most carriers charge $ 20 for each month remaining on a contract , and more if the customer has a data plan , so a subscriber who cancels a two - year plan after only one year would be on the hook for at least $ 240 .
Locked phones also force consumers to pay their carrier 's often - hefty roaming fees when travelling internationally .
With an unlocked phone , the owner can buy a Subscriber Identity Module ( SIM ) card from a local carrier for a small fee and make much cheaper calls wherever they may be .
Copyright law will test government
The situation may soon put the federal government into a bind .
The government has introduced new rules and , as some critics have said , bent others to spur new competition in Canada 's moribund wireless market .
In 2007 , over the fierce protests of Bell , Rogers and Telus , the government set rules on an auction of public airwaves that reserved a portion of licences for new companies .
The ensuing auction in 2008 netted a number of new players , including Wind and Mobilicity .
And late last year the government overruled the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission , which had decided to block Wind 's launch on the grounds the company 's ownership and control structure was n't Canadian enough .
Industry Minister Tony Clement said Wind had indeed satisfied Canadian ownership rules and gave the company the green light to start up .
Now , the government 's new copyright legislation — expected to be introduced on Thursday — could come into conflict with its pro-consumer stance on wireless .
Several leaked reports have said a key provision of the new bill will make it illegal for consumers to break digital locks placed on devices and content , which would effectively enshrine carriers ' locking of phones in law .
It is possible that some types of locks , such as those put on cellphones , will get exemptions from the anti-circumvention clause , but Clement was non-committal .
" We definitely can talk once the bill is introduced , " he said .
The Canadian bill has drawn comparisons with the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act , which criminalizes the breaking of digital locks .
Unlocking cellphones has been given an exemption under the DMCA , a clause that has been reviewed and extended periodically .
Michael Geist , a copyright expert and law professor at the University of Ottawa , says the locking issue in Canada goes beyond the upcoming bill .
Getting the copyright correct on unlocked phones is only the first step — further pro-consumer laws are necessary .
" There needs to be a positive obligation on carriers to unlock in certain circumstances , " Geist said .
" The carrier should be legally obligated to unlock the phone upon request . "
Legal obligations
In Europe , a number of countries have instituted such legal obligations , ranging from requiring the carrier to unlock phones immediately when asked by a customer to doing so at the conclusion of term contracts .
Some countries , such as Singapore , outlaw locking phones entirely .
PIAC had been hoping Canada 's new carriers — and the competition they 're injecting into the market — would sort out the issue of locked phones but that has n't happened yet .
" We were sort of hoping it would organically happen , that one of these carriers would be brave and let people put their own SIM card in it , " said John Lawford , a lawyer with PIAC .
" It 's better than it was but nobody 's been really , really aggressive .
These little guys are going to need more time . "
Internet search giant Google tried that " organic " approach earlier this year when it began selling its Nexus One phone directly to U.S. customers over the internet .
The unlocked phone was made available to Canadians in March and came in two different versions — one that would run on Bell , Rogers and Telus networks , and another that was compatible with Wind and Mobilicity .
Google announced in May that it will soon give up on selling the Nexus One , which is currently still available for $ 529 US , directly via the internet , citing poor sales .
" It ’s clear that many customers like a hands - on experience before buying a phone , and they also want a wide range of service plans to choose from , " the company said , adding that it would sell the Nexus One through carriers as other manufacturers do .
Some industry analysts said Google 's move was proof that North American consumers do n't want to pay the full price of their phone up front .
But that does n't mean they 're not in favour of having proper ownership over their device , Geist says .
" Once the contract expires and the subsidy has been paid for , it 's the consumer 's device , not the carrier 's . "

Earlier today , Boing Boing reported news that the U.S. has filed formal charges against Pfc. Bradley Manning , the 22 - year - old Army Intelligence Specialist who is believed to have leaked damning classified data to Wikileaks .
The " charge sheet " published on Boing Boing specified 8 federal criminal violations , including one identified as a violation of the Espionage Act .
I spoke to Lieutenant Colonel Eric Bloom of the U.S. Army 's Public Affairs Office for more .
The Army wo n't confirm that Manning leaked anything to Wikileaks , or that he obtained and transmitted " 260,000 State department cables , " the specific number widely reported — but the Army charge sheet released today does say the 22 - year - old engaged in " conduct being prejudicial to good order and discipline in the armed forces , " which threatened to " bring discredit upon the armed forces . "
Boing Boing / Xeni Jardin :
What are the maximum penalties in Manning 's case , based on the charges filed today ?
Do any of these charges carry the possibility of capital punishment ?
U.S. Army / Ltc. Eric Bloom :
No , I do n't think we 're talking about the death penalty .
We have calculated the maximum possible number of years based on these charges to be 52 years .
Boing Boing :
So , the organization he is said to have leaked all of this classified information to , Wikileaks —
Bloom :
We have not said that he has leaked all of this material .
We have not confirmed that .
And that organization is not named in the charges .
Boing Boing : Okay , understood .
So , the organization others have reported that Manning leaked videos and State Department cables to , Wikileaks , I 'm reading that they 've said they have attempted to connect Manning with a lawyer , with civilian legal representation , but that those attempts have been rebuffed .
Is he represented by any civilian attorney ?
Bloom :
We have no knowledge of any civilian attorneys he has retained .
He is free to do so at any time .
I do not know of any rebuffing .
I 've been in the military for 26 years , and I 've never heard of any party 's attempt to secure legal representation being denied .
We do n't rebuff representation .
Boing Boing :
What happens next ?
Bloom :
As part of the Uniform Code of Military Justice , the next step in proceedings would be an Article 32 Hearing , which is similiar to a grand jury .
An investigating officer will be appointed , and that officer looks into all facts of the matter , does an investigation , and upon conclusion , the findings will be presented to a convening court martial authority .
The division commander will consider based on what is in that , what the next steps are .
Either there is enough evidence or not enough evidence to proceed to a court - martial .
Boing Boing :
Where is Manning currently detained ?
Bloom : He is Kuwait at Camp Arifjan .
Boing Boing :
When will the next step in the proceedings take place ?
Bloom : A date has not yet been set .
We have n't even identified the investigating officer .
We 're still in the early stages of this case .

Few journalists have had as great an influence — or been proved right so often — as the man who , for 23 years , was the deputy editor of The Economist
WHEN Norman Macrae died on June 11th , aged 89 , no major British newspaper published an obituary of him .
You could blame The Economist 's tradition of anonymity ; you could blame the extraordinary modesty of the man himself who , if you tried to take his photo , would duck down and giggle , convinced that no one could possibly be interested in him .
Yet Norman was one of the intellectual giants of post - war Britain : one of the very few journalists who could bear comparison with the best brains of his time .
Like Milton Friedman , he applied free - market principles to public services such as education and council housing .
Like Daniel Bell , he charted the shift from the industrial to the post - industrial society .
And like Peter Drucker he illuminated the internal workings of companies , the organisations that drove the West 's prosperity and guaranteed its freedoms .
He kept the flame of free - market thinking burning during the long night of collectivism .
He predicted the collapse of the Soviet Union , at a time when the CIA was obsessed by Russia 's growing strength , and foresaw the privatisation of industry , when other intellectuals were celebrating the triumph of the “ mixed economy ” .
Norman was the first journalist to “ discover ” Japan .
In 1962 he wrote a survey predicting that a country most Westerners regarded as synonymous with knick - knacks and knock - offs would become an industrial power - house .
He was also the first journalist to “ discover ” the internet .
In 1984 he wrote another survey arguing that life was about to be transformed by “ terminals ” which would give users access to giant databases .
He predicted that the 1973 energy shock would eventually lead to a surge in the supply of energy .
He also dismissed the Club of Rome 's prediction that the world was about to run out of food as arrant nonsense .
The Economist was fortunate that Norman decided to park his formidable intellect at 25 St James 's Street .
During his almost 40 years here — 23 of them , from 1965 to 1988 , as deputy editor — he did more than anyone else to provide the intellectual originality of what he liked to describe as “ the world 's favourite viewspaper ” .
He constantly enlivened editorial meetings with proposals to allow Disneyworld to run the West 's cities or to move the British government from London to York .
Roy Jenkins rightly described him as the “ epitome of the internal spirit of The Economist ” .
He could be a brutal editor and a savage critic of flabby ideas .
He altered colleagues ' copy with abandon .
But he was greatly liked , generous with his time and amiable in conversation .
He was also a loyal company man , never allowing his growing renown to go to his head .
He frequently slept in his office , his large frame heaped on the floor , and sweated blood to correct errant facts as well as to expunge creeping heresy .
More than anyone else , he made sure that The Economist was not blown off course by the winds of ideological fashion or becalmed in routine reporting .
But if The Economist was lucky to find Norman , he was lucky to find The Economist .
His website poses a question at the end of each of his essays : “ Brilliant ?
Batty ? ” and invites readers to join the fray .
His undoubted eccentricity was partly a matter of personal style .
The words tumbled out in an incoherent jumble interrupted by heaving shoulders and gales of cackling laughter .
His handwriting was such a scrawl that only one person in the world , his loyal secretary , Elizabeth Methold , could decipher it — and she could perform this miracle only by holding the script at arm 's length , half - shutting her eyes and ( in her words ) going into a trance .
The eccentricity extended to his writing .
Norman was a punctilious student of statistics .
But he was quite happy to illustrate a 1969 article on American productivity with the assertion that a time - and - motion study of housewives at the kitchen sink would “ almost certainly find ” that the average American housewife was twice as efficient as the average British one .
Why ?
Because the American housewife was capable of instinctively working out in her head , for each chore , “ some rough approximation of what modern businessmen call a critical path analysis ” .
The Economist provided him with the ideal mixture of freedom and discipline .
He could travel to any corner of the world he fancied to produce lengthy reports on anything he wished , from the state of America to the future of mankind .
Many of these special reports became books .
But he was reined in when he got a bit too wild — as when he advocated writing a cover leader championing a nasal spray to “ cure ” homosexuals ( who , he thought , were driven that way by their aversion to the smell of their mothers ) .
He was passed over three times for the editorship .
But , in truth , he was in exactly the right position .
The crystal ball
His greatest gift was his uncanny ability to predict the future .
But the problem with the future is that it eventually arrives .
Visions that are called from the vasty deep become reality .
Ideas that were once pooh - poohed as outlandish become commonplace .
“ Nobody listened , then everybody did , ” Norman wrote ruefully in a 1991 article called “ A future history of privatisation , 1992 - 2022 ” .
To grasp his prescience , it is necessary to return to an era when today 's commonplaces were heresies .
Not so murky to him
During much of the post - war period the market was “ out ” and the benevolent state was “ in ” .
Public intellectuals such as Kenneth Galbraith argued that the age of the entrepreneur had given way to the age of the giant corporation .
Practical politicians poured money into British Steel and the Concorde project .
The market meant chaos and unemployment ; industrial policy meant smooth growth and jobs for all .
Norman saw this as a recipe for flabby politics and failed economics .
In 1954 he coined the term “ Butskellism ” to describe the portmanteau politics of the Conservative chancellor of the exchequer , R.A. Butler , and a Labour predecessor , Hugh Gaitskell .
Throughout the Butskellite era he relentlessly documented the failures of industrial policy and government planning .
This makes it sound as if Norman was nothing more than a prophet of the new right .
But the truth is more complicated — and , as befits the man , more idiosyncratic .
Even while he embraced the market on micro-economic policy , he remained more or less a Keynesian on macroeconomic policy until the late 1970s .
He was a firm believer in pumping up demand with deficit spending and holding down inflation with incomes policy .
No deficit was too big and no incomes policy too hopeless .
He greeted the first macroeconomic flushes of Reaganism and Thatcherism with sceptical editorials before finally admitting that he had been wrong .
It was perhaps the only time he was not ahead of the debate .
Norman also had no time for social conservatism .
He worried about broken families and out - of - wedlock births , but entirely from a utilitarian rather than a moral point of view .
He dismissed the religious right as vigorously as he dismissed feminists and environmentalists ( “ both simple and psychotic Americans have too often been dominated by religious liars ” ) .
He argued that one of man 's greatest problems in the coming years would be growing life - expectancy — and advocated a “ system of planned death ” to deal with it .
In a survey of America in 1975 he predicted that euthanasia would soon be as acceptable as abortion : “ It will not be at all surprising if there is in some quite near decade - and - a - half a similarly swift and equally civilised dash to acceptance of killing off old codgers ( by then , like me ) as there has been , in so short a twinkling , towards the more emotive act of killing unborn babies . ”
In Stalin's Russia
Why did Norman think as he did ?
Why did he reject the post - war consensus about the virtues of government ?
And why did he keep his distance from a new right that embraced so many of his ideas ?
Part of the answer lies in his personality .
Norman was an extraordinarily self - contained figure .
He seldom used his telephone to call people , preferring to sit in his office poring over statistics .
He had few doubts about the rightness of his opinions .
Once he had an idea in his head he pushed it to its logical conclusion — and if he was proved wrong he simply shifted to another idea , which he pursued with equal certainty .
Richard Holt Hutton once wrote about Walter Bagehot 's “ dash and doubt ” .
Norman was just dash .
But his outlook was also shaped by his odd adolescence .
His father was a British consul in Moscow in 1935 - 38 , and Norman 's summer holidays from school were spent there at the height of Stalin 's purges .
He saw members of the embassy staff — including maids his own age — disappearing , probably to be shot .
Before and after his posting to Moscow his father also had jobs in Nazi - dominated Europe .
Many of his family 's Jewish friends were terrorised and later slaughtered .
When he left school in 1941 , Norman wrote later ,
my first job was a public - sector one , with public - sector productivity , as a teenager supposed to throw bombs about as an RAF navigator , creating a slum in the heart of the continent .
By the time I got there , the Russians were coming in from the other side .
All the politicians , including Churchill and Roosevelt , told us these were fine liberating democrats .
And of course I knew from those school summer holidays so briefly before that those were astonishing lies .
That has given me one advantage in my 40 years as a newspaperman .
I have never since then believed a word either politicians or public relations officers have said .
Norman 's early experiences did not just sour him to politicians .
They soured him to collectivism in all its many varieties .
He had no time for the government - worshipping intellectuals he found when he studied economics at Cambridge in 1945 - 47 .
He loathed the feminists and black - power activists he came across in America in the late 1960s and 1970s , smelling in their affection for group rights and their willingness to use intimidation the same intolerance he had smelt in Europe in the 1930s and 1940s .
He took his children on trips to eastern Europe in order to teach them the difference between freedom and tyranny .
He seldom missed an opportunity to champion the “ hard hats ” over the “ soft heads ” .
Norman 's case for market capitalism did not rest merely on its ability to create wealth , but on its capacity to advance individual freedom .
He was almost as critical of big - company capitalism as he was of big - government socialism .
In a 1976 survey on “ The coming entrepreneurial revolution ” he argued that big business was as doomed as big government .
Hierarchical managers sitting in their skyscrapers could no longer arrange how brain workers should best use their imaginations .
The future lay with small firms that could exploit individual creativity and with bigger firms that could split themselves into small centres and encourage competition between them .
Norman 's critique of the welfare state was inspired by a similar belief in individualism .
He pointed out that the market had produced a remarkable equalisation in people 's lives .
Rich and poor had access to the same consumer goods — the same television programmes , the same comfortable armchairs , the same plethora of goods in supermarkets , which were spreading from the suburbs to the slums .
In 1945 the average Englishman had only one pair of trousers ; in the swinging 1960s he had access not only to lots of pairs of ( tight ) trousers but also to holidays in the sun and cheap mortgages .
The great exception to this story of equalisation was the state .
The state distributed its largesse disproportionately to the rich — exactly the opposite of what was supposed to happen — allowing them to end up with better schools and better health services .
It also trapped the poorest in poverty , in sink estates with lousy schools and soaring crime and in public - sector jobs with little prospect of long - term prosperity .
Norman argued that the only way to change this was to empower individuals — to allow them to own their own homes , through privatisation , and to choose their own schools , through vouchers .
Give power to the state and you end up with self - serving interest groups .
Give power to the individual and you apply the same creative ingenuity to public services as companies have long done to the invention of washing powder .
Norman 's belief in individualism also drove his enthusiasm for technology .
This enthusiasm provoked widespread mirth at The Economist .
The man who predicted the rise of the internet in 1984 and preached the virtues of telecommuting in articles on almost anything was by far the most incompetent member of the staff when it came to using new ( or not so new ) inventions .
In battles with the office fax machine he usually came off worse .
It was rumoured that paper clips baffled him .
The staff were amazed when the Atex publishing system was introduced in 1982 and Norman revealed that he could actually type .
But as a techno - visionary he had few equals .
He predicted a world in which “ books , files , television programmes , computer information and telecommunications will merge ” — in which people could explore the world 's knowledge repositories at a touch of a button , and in which readers would have access to custom - made newspapers paid for by targeted advertising ( in typical fashion , he imagined this newspaper emerging from a fax machine at the back of the television ) .
He saw that this revolution would have huge implications for the balance of power .
Giant organisations such as governments and companies would lose their comparative advantage .
Entrepreneurs would be empowered .
Taxpayers would flee the coop and telecommute from rural villages — thus putting more pressure on governments to give up their powers and start serving people rather than bossing them about .
The last clue to Norman was that he was a consummate newspaperman .
In print — or indeed on the lecture podium — the cackling incoherence of his speech simply vanished , and he was invariably lucid and frequently amusing , even coruscating .
( A similar stylishness could be seen on the tennis court , where the immobility of middle age did nothing to inhibit a well - aimed slice that flummoxed younger and nimbler players . )
He was one of the best word - coiners of his generation , producing “ intrapreneurship ” and “ telecommuting ” ( the coinage of “ privatisation ” and “ Eurocrat ” is disputed ) .
He littered his prose with memorable phrases .
Milton Friedman was “ the maddening gnome of Chicago ” .
American ghettoes exhibited “ public squalor amid private non-affluence ” .
In diagnosing the failure of British firms to get the most out of computers , he likened them to “ former slum dwellers who , when promoted into being council - house tenants , tended to keep coal in the bath ” .
In championing the virtues of entrepreneurship and people working in small teams , he pointed out that “ Jesus Christ tried 12 , and that proved one too many . ”
Everything he wrote was compulsively readable — partly because he mixed battiness with brilliance and partly because he came at everything from such unexpected angles .
His 1975 survey of “ America 's third century ” started by posing a surprising public - policy quandary :
Our children will probably “ progressively ” be able to order their babies with the shape and strength and level of intelligence that they choose , as well as alter existing human beings so as to insert artificial intelligence , retune brains , change personality , modify moods , control behaviour .
That raised troubling ethical issues which would be best decided by a world that was shaped by America rather than “ the inexperienced Japanese ” .
Yet it was those Japanese who best demonstrated Norman 's skills as a journalist .
In 1962 he visited Japan to get a measure of how the country had changed since the second world war .
He learned little from talking to British ex-pats .
But then , in a Mitsubishi factory , he came across a British machine - tool salesman who told him that Japanese workers were getting three times as much out of their machines as their better paid British counterparts .
The resulting article , “ Consider Japan ” , sealed his global reputation as a journalist and turned him into a hero in Japan ( on his retirement in 1988 he was honoured by the emperor with the Order of the Rising Sun ) .
He argued that the key to Japanese success lay in their plethora of tiny entrepreneurial component - makers and in their ability to break up huge plants into “ small but brotherly ” profit centres .
He predicted that the Japanese productivity miracle would transform the world economy .
Arise Sir Norman , knight of the rising sun !
An eternal optimist
But for all his interest in the rest of the world , he was a very English figure .
His ideas were rooted in the English liberalism of the 19th century — a liberalism that celebrated the individual over the collective , progress over reaction , free thought over superstition .
This set him against both the “ over - government ” that had triumphed in his youth and the religious conservatism that prospered under Reaganism .
But it also turned him into an irrepressible optimist .
Few people since Bagehot and Macaulay have been so convinced that life is getting better , and that it will get better still if only a few doltish politicians can be elbowed out of the way .
This commitment to classical liberalism ensures that much of his work continues to sing .
Norman devoted his energies to two of the most ephemeral bits of journalism — opinionated leaders and lengthy exercises in futurology .
Yet a remarkable amount of what he wrote remains relevant today .
His 1975 survey on America 's 200th birthday , in which he chastises the Democrats for flirting with the Fabian cult of government expertise , conservatives for flirting with religious extremism , and business for underinvesting in innovation , might easily be a portrait of Barack Obama 's America .
Big government has been on the march for much of the past decade .
The Beijing consensus celebrates the alliance of big government and big companies .
Much of the public sector has resisted the power of vouchers and internal markets .
The battle that Norman fought for so long has still not been won .
New Hampshire Republican Congressional candidate Bob Giuda compared gay marriage to bestiality in a discussion following a speech to college students on Monday :
" Giuda had just spoken at Rivier College when he was approached by a small group of people challenging his position on gay rights .
' During that period of time , I was asked a question about gay marriage , which , of course , I oppose , because I believe marriage is strictly between a man and a woman , ' Giuda said .
But in making his point on what he believes are the boundaries within the definition of marriage , Giuda reportedly said : ' What 's going to happen next ?
Men and sheep ?
Women and dogs ? ' …
' That comment was made in the context of a discussion about institutionalizing marriage , ' Giuda said …
' The point was , it 's not to our good as a nation or society to institutionalize relationships that do not involve a man and a woman for the protection of a family , ' he said .
Giuda admitted his comments could be considered offensive to same - sex couples .
' I see where it could be taken out of context and people could take offense at it , ' he said . "
Giuda , who says he supports civil unions , is also against repeal of " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell " .
According to WMUR , " Giuda is running for the Republican nomination for the state 's 2nd District seat , which will be open as U.S. Rep. Paul Hodes runs for Senate . "

For students like Anthony Roberts , 18 , and Deandre Briber , 18 , at the Prologue Early College High School in Chicago , the federal money offers some hope .
Both are applying to the alternative school ’s summer jobs program .
Last summer , with the aid of stimulus money , the school hired dozens of students , according to its principal , Pa Joof .
This summer , without the money , the school can afford just 10 .
“ It was great last summer , ” he said .
“ We had 80 to 90 kids kept off of the street seven or eight weeks .
They were able to come right back to school without any problem ” in the fall , he added .
“ What ’s happening right now in Chicago , you let these kids out there for four or five weeks , we are going to lose some of them .
That ’s just the nature of the streets . ”
Mr. Briber , who graduates next January , said he had applied at T.J. Maxx , Target , Kmart , and at a local docking company , with no luck .
Having an income will help ease the burden on his mother , he said .
Also , he said , “ I feel like I do need to get a job because I ’m kind of a handful .
I want things , clothes , and to take care of myself .
I just want to be on my own , to help out with bills . ”
Mr. Roberts , who graduates in June and plans to attend college , said he had been searching for a job for a year and a half .
Everywhere he goes , Mr. Roberts says , there are other teenagers ahead of him .
“ It bothers me , but at the same time , ” he said , “ I try not to let it bother me . ”

In Boston , at the Charlestown High School , Jamila Hussein , 19 , said she had been running into the same problem in looking for a part - time job in retail or restaurants .
“ It ’s harder than it sounds , ” said Ms. Hussein , who has a summer internship lined up in July to clerk for a judge .
“ Right now , some of the things , even if they are available , you have adults looking . ”
E ! News hit the red carpet for Steve 's new movie Despicable Me last night , and Steve made it clear he was not joking when he told BBC Radio he would leave The Office after the coming 2010 - 2011 season .
" I just think it 's time , " Steve told our Kristina Guerrero .
" I want to fulfill my contract .
When I first signed on I had a contract for seven seasons , and this coming year is my seventh .
I just thought it was time for my character to go . "
But according to Steve , The Office could go on without him .
" It does n't certainly mean the end of the show .
I think it 's just a dynamic change to the show , which could be a good thing , actually .
Add some new life and some new energy ... I see it as a positive in general for the show . "
A positive that Michael Scott could be leaving Dunder Mifflin for good ?
Anyone else having a problem seeing that ?
Still , Steve , doused in Eau to Humility , had this to say about the attention he 's receiving for his exit : " I did n't see it as a huge thing and I certainly did n't anticipate any sort of hubbub over it .
I 'm just not going to extend my contract , but I did n't see it as a huge deal .
And the show is great , and the ensemble is so strong , and the writers are great , so it 's just one part of that ensemble drifting off .
They 've incorporated so many new characters and so many new , great storylines that I have no doubt it 'll continue as strong if not stronger than ever . "
Color me gullible , but that sure does n't sound like the usual bargaining ploy to me .
So file this one under Dammit !
' Cause Steve Carell sure seems dead serious he plans to leave The Office .
We have n’t featured Bruno Mars on this blog apart from when he has made vocal appearances on other rappers ’ tracks , but now that he has announced the impending release of this debut EP
It ’s Better If You Don’t Understand , I feel that it ’s definitely time to feature him as a solo act .
I ’m going to stick my neck out and say that we will be seeing and hearing a lot from this young man in the future .
You may have heard quite a lot of him before though , as he was responsible for co-writing the international hit Right Round for Flo Rida .
He is also attributed with production credits for some Maroon 5 songs , but I can’t find any physical evidence to prove that correct , so i’m assuming that he may be a part of their new album Hands All Over , said to be dropping in June .
As a result of this impressive impact on other artists ’ tracks , his record company have finally decided to give him the chance to release his own material , and The Other Side is the perfect opportunity to add value to his brand even more .
Sounding slightly like something Gnarls Barkley may produce , Bruno comes in with his own writing team to pen another absolutely fantastic pop song .
B.o. B repays the favour for helping him to reach the number one spot with a cameo , as does Cee - Lo Green , who compliments Bruno ’s vocals exquisitely .
Listen to it for yourself below !
Enjoy .

In the beginning , he was a gazelle whose neck the hunters were seeking .
With time , he tried to become a seagull in the hope that if he was in the sky , they would not bring him down .
He went to every corner of the land to build a nest for his rejected hopes , to find a refuge , until he finally found a place to rest his legs and soul Nitzana .
Late MK Arie Lova Eliav was the first traitor .
But I did not speak out because I was not Lova .
Later on , they attacked the people of the kibbutzim for being hedonists , and the kibbutz for being a place where people sit on easy chairs and take a dip in the pool , where the grass is greener and the water is the brightest blue .
So they imprisoned them within the security fence ; they broke their spirits .
The Zionists gem and pride turned into a wreck that would not be worth its weight in the settlements gold .
But I did not speak out because I was not a kibbutznik .
After that , they settled accounts with the media , tamed it and emasculated it , and instead of being a watchdog , it became a pet .
They exposed the left - wing mafia and eliminated the moles .
Since then , the media has fled everyday reality for reality shows .
What is happening in reality is not to be shot by the camera , and only what is shot is actually happening .
But I did not speak out because I didnt work in television .
Then they began lynching the judges .
They do not sit among their people , they said , and who are they anyway , and what do they understand ?
Its better to be judged by pagans than by apostates who are Meretzs secret spies .
Even the government no longer abides by their hostile rulings .
But I did not speak out because I was not a judge .
After that they began to lash out at the countrys Arabs and other minorities , saying they were a Trojan horse ; that evil would come forth from their bellies and their wombs .
It is an act of kindness to discriminate against them and their children for generations to come , and it is obligatory to make their equality conditional on an oath of allegiance .
Until they swear allegiance and implore , they will be conditional citizens and whenever possible will be put to the test .
Even the most faithful of the faithful will not return to their homes in Biram and Ikrit , as they had been promised .
But I did not speak out because I was not an Arab and not a refugee .
And then they dealt with the non-governmental organizations , and everyone who was not prepared to serve as the long arm of the government .
If you did not join in the chorus , you would be silenced and suspected of having alien money and ulterior motives , and your ship would not be allowed to pass .
But I did not speak out because I had no connection with the New Israel Fund , Adallah or BTselem .
After that , they pounced like predators on the education system .
The school principal who does not salute the Israel Defense Forces as the generations guiding light had better watch out ; he will be in trouble if he calls the occupation by its name .
But I did not speak out because I was not an educator .
Nor was I a foreign worker who spreads illness , so I kept silent .
Now they are attacking the academic world in the hope of conquering it the syllabus for the most part is anti-Zionist or post - Zionist and it destroys the souls of our youth .
That has been revealed by a new study that people with their finger on the trigger pulled out of thin air .
But I do not intend to speak out because I am not a professor .
It is merely a matter of time until they reach me too , and you as well .
But by that time , there will no longer be anyone here who can speak out on my behalf or yours .
The PV industry happens to be the fastest growing industry in the world , with a promising chance to remain the fastest growing industry for the next 25 to 50 years .
The PV industry worldwide grew at a compound annual rate of 35 % during 2000 - 2009 .
What is the cause of this enormous growth and why is it expected to continue ?
The reason is really quite simple .
The market demand is enormous and PV has a number of unique characteristics that give it clear and significant advantages over any other source of electrical energy .
Unique Advantages of PV :
No moving parts , minimal maintenance Safe and simple operation High dependability , durable and long life ( 30 + years )
Scalable in output , from micro-watts to millions of watts ( megawatts )
Silent operation Maximum output coincident with peak utility power loads ( summer time )
No emissions , no pollution Portable , easy and fast to install anywhere Available everywhere there is sunlight .
Ability to integrate attractively into existing and new buildings
What the PV Industry Needs
What could an industry with all these unique advantages , plus being the fastest growing industry in the world , possibly need ?
The answer is quite simple .
It needs to reduce its cost of production .
Bottom line , it currently costs too much to produce PV cells .
In order to dramatically reduce the cost , the industry must deploy next generation technologies that are scalable to larger volumes that will enable the needed cost reductions .
How could there be an industry with a product that is too expensive be the fastest growing industry in the world ?
This contradiction is a result of the fact that the market is so vast , and that despite the current tremendous industry growth , it is only the beginning of the industry ’s long - term growth curve .
Incredible as it may sound the industry actually has the potential to grow at 30 % per annum rates for decades .
Regardless of this dichotomy , long - term world demand will exceed long term supply ( even at current “ high ” costs ) and when future decreases in cost are accomplished the demand will literally soar far beyond the capabilities of current technology .
To address this coming demand surge , new next - generation technologies , capable of far greater production volumes , will be necessary ; hence process scalability will be needed .
United States Electricity Market
The current U.S. electricity demand is roughly 4 trillion watts ( 4 Terawatts or TW ) and is growing at approximately 2.5 % per year .
Current projections place demand somewhere between 11 TW and 18 TW by 2050 .
To illustrate the tremendous potential of the PV industry and also the current and future demand - supply imbalance facing the industry let ’s look at a few macro numbers .
For PV to supply only 1 % of the U.S. demand in 2010 , the worldwide PV production capacity would have to be 44 billion watts , which is over 20 times larger than current worldwide capacity .
It is obvious that expanding the total industry capacity 20 fold in a few years is impossible , one thing for sure , we MUST set the bar a lot higher .
Note :
Megawatt ( MW ) = one million watts of electricity
Gigawatt ( GW ) = one thousand megawatts ( one billion watts ) of electricity
Terawatt ( TW ) = one thousand gigawatts ( one trillion watts ) of electricity
U.S. Electricity Demand 2010 vs. Current PV Industry Capacity
Percentage of Demand ( 2010 ) to be met with PV GW of capacity needed #
Times larger than current worldwide industry capacity 1 % 44 20 Times Larger 5 % 220 125 Times Larger 10 % 440 250 Times Larger
The above table shows the enormous potential of PV and how large worldwide PV capacity would have to be compared to current industry capacity , for PV to achieve 1 % , 5 % and 10 % of the worldwide electricity market .
At least two points become very clear from the table above :
The potential market for PV worldwide is absolutely enormous ;
New production technologies will be needed to produce far greater volumes at far lower prices if the industry is ever going to make a significant penetration of this huge market .
Currently 90 % + of the world ’s solar cells are manufactured using silicon technology .
This technology is over 50 years old and the good news is that it has done an amazing job at dramatically reducing the price of solar cells over the years .
The bad news is that the price needs to decrease even more and it cannot do this without technologies that can be scaled up to produce GW and not the current industry MW .
Unless the industry develops a manufacturing technology or discovers a new breakthrough technology that is capable of cost effectively producing PV at the GW level , PV can never make a significant contribution to future electricity generation .
Importance of Development of the Next Generation of Manufacturing
In addition to the obvious huge business opportunity , there may be other factors that will necessitate the rapid development of the PV industry and a host of new next - generation clean technologies .
This future increase in demand may not be able to be addressed by fossil fuel sources for a number of reasons that , for the most part may be beyond our control :
Limitations to addressing this growth via fossil fuels :
Peak Oil : Short term , Peak Oil is approaching , when worldwide demand will exceed supply permanently .
This may cause a rapid and permanent rise in the price of oil and natural gas that will make them uneconomical at best and unavailable at worst .
Short term , Peak Oil is approaching , when worldwide demand will exceed supply permanently .
This may cause a rapid and permanent rise in the price of oil and natural gas that will make them uneconomical at best and unavailable at worst Global Warming : Longer term , global warming may drastically limit our use of fossil fuels to generate electricity .
This will be especially true of generation of electricity with coal , which currently supplies over 50 % of the electricity generated in the U.S. and is a very significant contributor to carbon to our atmosphere .
Bottom Line
The future of the PV industry and how significant of a role it will play is a question of scale .
We have to start thinking big and we have to start right now .
The answer is clear : we need to accelerate our development of next generation technologies , with far greater production capacity , so that we will have far lower cost of production .
There are a number of other macro and micro factors that will also be needed , which I will cover in a subsequent article .
But the bottom line from a macro point of view is quite simply :
The world needs PV technology capable of GW of PV production not MW .

Canadian government accused of barring non-mainstream reporters from summit
UPDATE : Seventy - five people were arrested in downtown Toronto Saturday after G20 protests turned violent , and police confirmed they used bean bag guns , pepper spray and tear gas in skirmishes with protesters .
The protests came as the leaders of the world ’s largest economies gathered to discuss the economic crisis that swept the world over the past two years .

Toronto police praised the vast majority of protesters , who marched peacefully through the city core to draw attention to issues such as environmental degradation , poverty and human rights .
But some activists were angered at the “ pre-arrests ” of four G20 protest organizers by Toronto police in the pre-dawn hours of Saturday .
Protest organizer Niki
Thorne said in a statement emailed to the press that 20 police officers raided the house she was sharing with other protest leaders and arrested four people .
“ Police forcibly detained and cuffed a number of people , and refused to allow those in the house to call for legal advice .
Without showing warrants , asking consent , or giving notice , police did an illegal cursory search of some of the people on the premises as well as the house itself , ” Thorne said .
According to the Globe and Mail , the four people were charged with conspiracy to commit mischief .

“ Police allege the group was planning to break off from peaceful protest and launch violent attacks against police , ” the newspaper stated .
ORIGINAL STORY FOLLOWS BELOW
TORONTO — Parts of Toronto ’s downtown core were in chaos Saturday evening as a G20 protest turned violent , with police shutting down public transit into the city and protesters setting fire to police cars .
Police told media that a small group of “ Black bloc ” demonstrators broke off from a protest of 10,000 people and began smashing storefront windows along the city ’s trendy Queen Street .
Some scuffles between protesters and police were reported , but there were no reports of mass arrests as of Saturday evening .

The CBC News Network reported that protesters smashed in the windows of an American Apparel outlet , pulled out the mannequins and spread feces on the floor .
The storefronts of McDonald ’s and Starbucks locations were also damaged , as were numerous bank branches .
At least two police cars were set on fire in the city ’s financial district , and police shut down public transit in the city core , as well as a large downtown shopping complex .

REPORTERS FROM NON - MAINSTREAM
MEDIA ‘BARRED FROM CANADA ’
Numerous reports suggest that Canada ’s border guards have been refusing entry to reporters covering the G8 and G20 summits for non-mainstream news sources .

Two reporters from Chicago Indymedia were reportedly accused of being protesters and denied entry .
Reporters from WeAreChange were detained for at least four hours by border officials before being denied entry .
A reporter from the InfoWars news site was also denied entry .
Two activists from CodePink were also barred from entering Canada .
Activists have accused Canadian officials of using heavy - handed tactics in preparation for protests at the G8 and G20 summits .
On Friday , it emerged that the government of the province of Ontario had secretly changed a law to allow police to arrest anyone near the G20 meeting who does n’t identify themselves .
The change to the law was n’t made public until 31 - year - old Dave Vasey was arrested under the new powers .
Vasey was kept for hours in a caged area police set up to hold arrested protesters .
he told the Toronto Star Saturday that he plans to challenge the law as early as Monday .
Vasey ’s lawyer , Howard Morton , said the law violates Canada ’s constitution , which “ guarantees people freedom of assembly [ and ] the freedom of communication . ”

SMASHED HITS
Classic pop , reappraised by the Magazine
A Radio 2 chart this week has revealed that many of the biggest selling singles of the 1960s were decidedly square , daddio .
Welcome to the flip - side of the ultra -hip decade .
If a film - maker wants to transport you to 1960s Britain , you can bank on hearing a Lennon - McCartney tune , or something from the Rolling Stones - possibly even the Hollies .
You do n't tend to hear buck - toothed comedian Ken Dodd .
Listen to Tony Blackburn play the Top 60 of the 1960s Dodd ' third best seller of 60s '
Yet a 1965 Dodd hit , Tears , was the third - biggest - selling single of the decade , an analysis of record sales unveiled this week has revealed .
He is not alone - the best - sellers of the Sixties include healthy dollops of yodelling , crooning and clarinet - tootling among the recordings that are now part of the rock canon .
Just as the majority of Beatles fans were not peeling off kaftans to take LSD on Carnaby Street , a large part of the British record - buying public was n't listening to the Beatles at all .
Here are five of the least groovy but most popular artists of the Sixties .
KEN DODD Given the Liverpudlian performer 's propensity for pulling funny faces , those unfamiliar with Tears might expect to hear a comedy number , or at least a pastiche of someone else 's record .
TEARS Please turn on JavaScript .

But Dodd 's tickling stick is nowhere to be seen or heard .
Tears , also known as Tears For Souvenirs , is a very straight ballad in which Dodd beseeches an estranged lover to " forgive and forget / Turn our tears of regret once more to tears of happiness " .
It 's from an era when an all - round entertainer like Dodd would send the audience home with a gently - crooned oldie .
Originally recorded by American bandleader Rudy Vallee in 1929 , Tears spent almost half of 1965 in the charts , sat at number one for five weeks , and held off many songs that are more familiar to 21st - Century ears .
Dodd took a ribbing from his groovier contemporaries .
" All the pop groups , they could n't find things bad enough to say , " he told the BBC in 2007 .
" This was a middle - of - the - road song , and none of the rock - and - rollers could get in .
I kept them out and I got a golden disc .
It 's on two million now . "
Actually , DJ Tony Blackburn , who presented the chart of Sixties best sellers , gives the sales as " over a million " , rather than two million .
It was a different kind of inaccurate figure that saw Dodd return to the headlines in 1989 , when he was tried for tax evasion .
" The tax people still write to me , " he told BBC Liverpool last year .
" I got one of those brown envelopes the other day . "
" Self assessment ? " he added .
" I invented that . "
ENGELBERT HUMPERDINCK
One of the few singles at the top of the list to break the Dodd - Beatle Liverpudlian lock is Engelbert Humperdinck 's Release Me. RELEASE ME Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The Last Waltz ( #11 ) There Goes My Everything ( # 23 )
This one is a touch more modern than Tears : it 's a 1946 country - and - western ballad by Eddie " Piano " Miller .
Humperdinck - who was once Arnold Dorsey , an apprentice engineer from Leicester - had his stage name chosen for him by his manager , Gordon Mills .
" ' Who the hell is that ? '
I said .
' I did n't know he was the composer of [ opera ] Hansel And Gretel and he died in 1921 . "
Mills also managed another crooner , Tom Jones , and there was a sense that the Welsh client was getting the better material .
Songwriter Jimmy Webb sees Humperdinck 's success as testament to his talent , telling Billboard magazine : " While the other singer was getting the pick of the songs , Engelbert was doing almost as well with the second - rate songs . "
In fact , in this chart , Humperdinck does better : three in the top 25 to Jones 's one .
And Release
Me has lived on , as the theme to the Fast Show , as an enduring favourite at funerals , and as the answer to the pub quiz question " What kept Strawberry Fields Forever / Penny Lane off number one ? "
This success earned Humperdinck the opprobrium of rock purists ; he has since " atoned " by recording Penny Lane , but has yet to turn his attention to Strawberry Fields .
His home remains the middle of the romantic road , but he has made other incursions into rock , including Aerosmith 's I Don't Want To Miss A Thing and , for the Beavis and Butt - Head movie , a number called Lesbian Seagull .
He reflected on its lyrics : " I believe in choices , and whatever you want to do , you do .
Whatever makes you happy , do it . "
FRANK IFIELD
It took more than one big break for the Beatles to break big .
In 1962 , the band was given the chance to join The Tommy Wallis and Beryl Xylophone Team supporting yodelling crooner Frank Ifield at the Embassy Cinema , Peterborough .
They did not impress .
I REMEMBER YOU Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Lovesick Blues ( # 29 ) Though that may sound incongruous now , the chance to play with Ifield was one any act with aspirations would jump at : he was and remains one of the 1960s ' biggest sellers .
Ifield developed the trademark catch in his voice as a boy .
While milking cows in rural Australia , he heard hillbilly yodelling on the radio and recorded his first disc aged 13 .
His biggest hit combined the style with another song from his childhood : I Remember You started life in a 1941 musical , written by Johnny Mercer , allegedly to woo a married Judy Garland .
Frank Ifield was born in Coventry before his family emigrated down under ; after returning to the UK , he competed in A Song For Europe in 1962 and 1976 .
Which might explain why , in record - collecting circles , he is best known for an odd American LP .
The record label Vee - Jay , who owned the rights to four Beatles songs , concocted an album on a " British " theme with those four tracks and some Frank Ifield material .
The resulting release - Jolly What !
England 's Greatest Recording Stars On Stage - contained an unfortunate misnomer in its sleevenotes : " It is with a good deal of pride and pleasure that this copulation has been presented . "
THE SEEKERS
It is not the Seekers ' transatlantic hit Georgy Girl that sees them in this list , but their number ones I 'll Never Find Another You and The Carnival Is Over .
THE CARNIVAL IS OVER Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
I'll Never Find Another You ( # 38 ) Continuing the mild Australian invasion of the UK charts - see above and below - the Seekers arrived in Britain from Melbourne as the house band on a cruise ship .
Under the guidance of Dusty Springfield 's brother Tom , they spent 120 weeks on the charts with a string of vaguely - folkish harmony pop recordings .
Lead singer Judith Durham is a rare female voice on the top 60 list ; it also neither includes any Motown recordings , nor any tracks by The Who , The Kinks or Bob Dylan .
The Seekers ' biggest hit , The Carnival Is Over , has a history that makes Dodd 's 1920s ballad seem contemporary by comparison .
If you hum the catchy melody , you are humming a 19th - Century Russian folk song about Cossack Stenka Razin , who led a peasant rebellion in 1670 .
It is , so far , the only song to have been covered by both Boney M and Nick Cave .
The band was not immune to Beatlemania , recording , perhaps inevitably , Yesterday before the breakaway New Seekers had an enormous hit with I 'd Like To Teach The World To Sing , promoting , like the Beatles before them , Coca - Cola .
ROLF HARRIS Had Rolf Harris's
Two Little Boys been released a few weeks earlier , it would probably feature even higher in the decade 's top twenty : it was the last number one of the 1960s , but went on selling in 1970 .
TWO LITTLE BOYS Please turn on JavaScript .

Two Little Boys - but in which war ?
Rolf had been part of Sixties pop since the beginning : his Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport was a top - 10 single in 1960 ; he wrote new lyrics in 1963 and performed it with the Beatles on the radio show From Us To You : " Cut your hair once a year , boys / If it covers your ears , you can't hear " .
There is no real consistency to Rolf 's Sixties hits : the Aborigine - themed Sun Arise ; the calypso - inspired wobbleboard workout Kangaroo and Two Little Boys , the story of a pair of friends who play war games and then , as adults , fight in a real war .
Two Little Boys is perhaps the one with the most enduring legacy ( see link , right ) .
A turn - of - the - century music - hall number with echoes of Nelson dying on HMS Victory , it 's among the few Sixties tunes that Margaret Thatcher enjoyed and one which Rolf re-recorded in 2008 with a Welsh male voice choir to mark the 90th anniversary of the end of World War I .
The simplicity of the lyric makes it applicable to any war .
Rock legend has it that John Lennon sent Harris a telegram to congratulate him on getting an anti-Vietnam song to the top of the Christmas hit parade .
Whether you buy that interpretation , it 's certainly a feat none of Rolf 's countercultural counterparts managed .
Smashed Hits is compiled by Alan Connor .
Below is a selection of your comment .
Even the bizarre and unadventurous hits mentioned here were a vast improvement over the mind - numbingly boring rubbish churned out in the fifties !
I view the sixties as a period of experimentation rather than innovation , in music and other areas of art .
Chris Whelan , Bracknell A very interesting piece , although it induced in me whatever is the opposite of nostalgia .
The UK singles charts were always a good home for novelty records and dreadful crooners ... what about Benny Hill 's Fastest Milkman in the West and the likes of Sinatra , Tony Bennett and Andy Williams .
The truth is , there was a different demographic at work here -- the mums and dads .
Your buyers of " underground " records did n't bother much with singles and tended to buy LPs instead .
Clive , Sydney
What the writer does n't seem to realise is that all the " hip " music was not sanctioned or encouraged by radio or TV at that time .
That 's why you had your Rolf Harris or your Ken Dodd at the top of the hit parade .
All the interesting music was underground - records that were promoted by hard working touring bands .
Black Sabbath , Deep Purple , Cream - you name it - they did n't get any airplay at the time .
Ken Hickmott , Burlingame , California , USA I was n't around in the 60's , but neither were my peers and it always irks me to hear people say how today 's music is so much worse .
People just forget what the charts were actually like .
Colin , Toronto
So the majority of the Great British public liked rubbish music in the 60s , and so it remains , check contemporary charts for details .
The majority of people do n't really care for originality or credibility , that 's how Simon Cowell has become so wealthy - give the public what they want !
Junk !
Ad , Hereford , UK
You are quite right middle of the road ballards did do well in the 60's .
The point was ' mum and dad ' still bought records then and record sales were not dominated by the under 25's as they are today .
The real innovation was ' progressive rock ' and ' underground ' .
After 1968 no self respecting 20 year old would be caught dead watching ToTP 's or listening to Tony Blackburn .
The ' Hit Single ' meant very little to them LP's were the thing particularly after the Sergeant Pepper album .
Kevin Gray , Harrow I am haunted by some of those awful songs .
I guess that such gems as " Little White Bull " and " She Wears Red Feathers and a Hula Hula Skirt " will pop into my head and stay for days throughout the rest of my life .
No wonder we welcomed Elvis and the Beatles with such enthusiasm .
jim scott , Ashland , Or. USA Perhaps the reason these artists did so well was that they were talented .
The music of the 1960's was fun music .
The tunes were simple , foot - tapping and you could hear the words .
They did n't try to be PC , or make a point .
The supposed singers did n't shriek or scream , the rhythm was not a monotonous thump , thump .
Today it is possible to buy mush of the music of that era .
What is churned out now will be forgotten in ten years .
Pete Hodge , Up Holland
Let 's not forget the inimitable Pinky and Perky in this illustrious line up !
Although the Beatles and the Stones were in the charts on a regular basis for the majority of the sixties , one should also consider that during this time , there would also be other high flying acts occupying the charts ; there would n't be just the Beatles for example at number one in the top forty and then thirty nine blank spaces in the rest of the chart would there ?
BBC 4 have shown some cracking clips of various sixties acts , not all of them are hip to look at but capable of a catchy tune or a powerful message .
Charlie Smith , Nottingham
But in the 60s most teenagers did n't have much money to buy records .
I remember cringing at most of these but parents , who did buy records , loved them .
T Williams , Yorkshire , UK Having grown up in the period , I never thought of the music of the sixties as swinging or ' unswinging ' , it was just a very creative period encompassing many genre 's and performed by artists of all stripes .
Nowadays , I long for that variety in music of the present day but find it sadly lacking .... or perhaps its because you become more selective as you age !
Malcolm Sutton , Burnaby , British Columbia , CANADA
This comes as no surprise to those of us who were around at the time .
I was playing in a band which progressed from a Cliff & the Shadows type group in 1963 , into a Stax style group in 1966 .
We had wonderful adventures touring Europe & Israel .
However , all the boys in the group had Mums & Dads at home who had been in the war .
They had been liberated financially in the 1960s prosperity boom , and loved to buy their middle of the road music favourites to play on their record players & radiograms .
Ken Dodd , Matt Monro , Frank Ifield .
They just loved it .
Even if their sons were rocking it up or playing Otis Redding songs in Denmark & Germany !!
Kevin , Glossop
This article failed to point out that in the early 60's , those that enjoyed real rock were too young and too poor to buy records , these , so called , chart toppers were purchased by our parents who grew up on Big Band .
The BBC refused to play Rock , except by house bands , until pirate radio forced them to change .
Payola was rife , so entertainers from other fields could purchase a hit .
Once we were old enough to have discretional spending the ridiculous era of music faded into obscurity .
There is a huge gulf between those born before WWII and those who came after , it still exists today .

New Orleans , Louisiana ( CNN ) --
The lengthy documents they initially were asked to sign used language even a native English speaker would struggle to understand .
The Vietnamese interpreters BP first brought in for safety and cleanup training stirred painful memories and suspicions because they spoke to the elders with a North Vietnamese dialect and used what some described as " Communist terminology . "
The closings of fishing areas have been announced on radio stations these fishermen do n't follow , so some have piloted their boats where they should n't , which means tickets from the Coast Guard keep coming .
For the Vietnamese - Americans living in the Gulf Coast region , the oil disaster is especially complicated .
It 's made murky by language barriers , cultural misunderstandings and a history of challenges that have shaped them for more than half a century .
Their ties to seafood run deep and wide .
A third of all fishermen in the Gulf are Vietnamese , making them arguably the most affected minority out there .
More than 24,000 people of Vietnamese origin live in Louisiana , according to the last completed census .
About 6,000 live within a two - mile radius in the neighborhood of New Orleans East -- distinguishing it , the area 's priest says , as the greatest concentration of Vietnamese people outside of Vietnam .
In the rectory of Mary Queen of Vietnam Church , the Rev. Vien Nguyen sits in front of an altar to his ancestors and his Catholic faith .
Religious texts in English and his native tongue fill the high shelves around him , as do books bearing titles like " Freshwater Crayfish Aquaculture , " " The Evolution of Cajun & Creole Cuisine " and Franz Kafka 's " The Trial . "
Here , he introduces some of the Kafkaesque oil - disaster trials facing his own people .
He talks about their distrust of lawyers -- " sharks , " he calls them -- who 've come in from out of state , circling them with promises and confusing papers .
He mentions the mental health concerns -- depression , lack of sleep , tensions in homes -- that need to be addressed , a task made difficult by an absence of Vietnamese - speaking therapists in a community that still stigmatizes admissions of emotional trouble .
He worries about the lack of job training and opportunities for a people who 've worked in an industry that may suffer for God knows how long .
" These are proud , active people who contribute to their own livelihood , and now they have to be in lines , " asking for handouts , he says .
" It is a devastating blow . "
About 80 percent of Vietnamese - Americans in the Gulf region are connected to the seafood industry through jobs that include fishing , shucking oysters , packing shrimp , and running stores and restaurants , the priest and others say .
The work they do is something many brought with them from fishing villages in their native land , a place most of them fled as " boat people " after the 1975 fall of Saigon and the end of the Vietnam War .
That departure was for many the second time they 'd become refugees .
They 'd already uprooted themselves and started over with nothing in 1954 , when their country divided into North and South and they , as the Catholic minority living in Vietnam , ran from the Communist rule that took over the North .
The former Archbishop Philip Hannan of the Archdiocese of New Orleans reached out to them in refugee camps in America , inviting them to call his home theirs .
So they came here in the '70s and ' 80s with the help of Catholic Charities and , over the next 30 years , reinvented their lives once more -- in a climate reminiscent of the country they 'd left behind .
They worked hard in a familiar industry that did n't require them to master English , often leaving their children to be cared for by older siblings and relatives so they could put in long days .
They created a self - reliant community where their own local businesses thrived .
They planted acres of vegetable gardens along levees , incorporating the agricultural roots of their ancestors .
Today , people wearing the traditional conical straw hats stoop in their cultivated yards or walk along streets with names like Saigon Drive .
A trailer , lined with coolers of freshly caught shrimp for sale at hiked - up prices , is parked in front of a strip mall that includes Tram Anh Video , Kim Tram Jewelry and Tien Pharmacy .
Hurricane Katrina five years ago marked the third time they lost everything and had to start over .
But it was also the storm that gave them a voice .
The documentary " A Village Called Versailles " -- a reference to the public housing project where they first settled -- debuted on PBS last month .
It chronicles how the Vietnamese - Americans living in New Orleans East galvanized after Katrina , making theirs among the first neighborhoods to rebuild .
Grass - roots organizers established agencies to fight for assistance and empower people , including one for youth called the Vietnamese American Young Leaders Association of New Orleans ( VAYLA - NO ) .
The church , which began holding Mass just six weeks after the floodwaters destroyed what they 'd created , became a staging ground for construction help and community meals .
Health clinics sprouted up , as did a new charter school .
And collectively , they protested a planned 90 - foot - high landfill of hurricane debris on their neighborhood 's edge , shutting down a move by the city government that they 'd never confronted en masse before .
A few years later , in 2008 , they'd help elect the nation 's first Vietnamese - American congressman , Louisiana Republican Anh " Joseph " Cao .
The next challenge : oil
Over a bowl of homemade pho , a Vietnamese beef noodle soup , Tuan Nguyen provides a glimpse into how the community is mobilizing to face its newest challenge .
He 's the 30 - year - old deputy director of the Mary Queen of Vietnam Community Development Corporation ( MQVN CDC ) , established after Katrina , and serves on the rapid response team created by Cao after the oil disaster .
Along with others on the team , he 's been crisscrossing the region , meeting with fishermen and others -- not just Vietnamese -- to assess their needs , gather testimonies , answer questions and advocate on their behalf .
They 've succeeded in gaining the ear of a BP official , Larry Thomas , who among other things has approved the hiring of qualified and trained bilingual interpreters .
" We had never been exposed to the Vietnamese community , " says Thomas , the BP manager of government and public affairs for the lower 48 states and the Gulf of Mexico .
" Clearly , it 's a tight - knit community , and it 's been a steep learning curve for us .
The interaction has been great . "
Even with all he knows about navigating the system and securing whatever assistance is available , whether that 's food stamps or BP claim dollars , Nguyen can't persuade some of his own relatives to get the help they so desperately need .
" One of my wife 's uncles is a very proud man .
He 's a deckhand .
I told him to come in and talk about services , " Nguyen says .
" He said , ' I ca n't stand in line .
What if someone sees me ? ' "
While his wife 's uncle wo n't accept assistance , others in the state have driven hours to get simple answers to questions from agencies like the MQVN CDC .
The hope , Nguyen and others say , is that grass - roots organizations will sprout up elsewhere to help meet the growing and often different community needs .
One such organization has already been formed in Biloxi , Mississippi , an area that is home to about 5,000 Vietnamese - Americans .
The Mississippi Coalition of Vietnamese American Fisherfolk and Families , led by volunteers , is hoping to step in where the New Orleans organizations logistically can't .
Celina Tran , 36 , is working full - time -- on top of her real estate broker job -- to help wherever she can .
She 's accompanying people to the BP claims office .
She 's meeting with fisherfolk to discuss their concerns and recognizes with frustration how unqualified she is to talk to them about fights in their marriages .
She 's sending testimonials to the state judiciary , in an attempt to force Mississippi to expand assistance opportunities .
And all the while , she 's worrying about what the future holds .
She sees families falling behind on mortgages -- for their homes and their boats .
At about $ 1 million a pop , many of the big Biloxi vessels require payments of $ 10,000 to $ 15,000 a month .
The up to $ 5,000 a month that BP is paying out to captains and boat owners is of little comfort to them , especially when there are home mortgages , too , college tuition payments and more .
" They 've been doing this for 45 years , 50 years of their life .
They 've relied on each other , " Tran says .
" If this drags out , it will only get worse . "
Nearly 180 miles away , back over the Louisiana state line , Ngoc Nguyen is racing around with her clipboard .
She and her husband own St. Vincent Seafood in Leeville , a small fishing community .
It 's a business they took over from her father - in - law , who 's standing around the dock in his " Luck of the Irish " T - shirt .
The shrimp being unloaded off their boat amounts to a third of what they usually bring in , says Nguyen , 27 .
It was out for two months , but given water closures imposed because of the oil disaster , access to shrimp was limited .
" There 's nothing else we can do , " she says , refusing to ponder what the family 's alternative would be if life does n't get back to normal , and soon .
" We 've never invested in anything else .
It 's all seafood . "
But Rep .
Cao holds out hope that the Vietnamese community in the Gulf will pull through -- because it always has .
" We are resilient people .
We are survivors , " he says .
" It 's an obstacle in life , and we will overcome it .
And we will emerge stronger . "

Airport body scanners ' could give you cancer ' , warns expert
Full body scanners at airports could increase your risk of skin cancer , experts warn .
The X - ray machines have been brought in at Manchester , Gatwick and Heathrow .
But scientists say radiation from the scanners has been underestimated and could be particularly risky for children .
They say that the low level beam does deliver a small dose of radiation to the body but because the beam concentrates on the skin - one of the most radiation - sensitive organs of the human body - that dose may be up to 20 times higher than first estimated .
No worries : A US scientist has claimed that the risk of getting cancer from a single airport body scanner is about 1 in 30 million
Dr David Brenner , head of Columbia University 's centre for radiological research , said although the danger posed to the individual passenger is ' very low ' , he is urging researchers to carry out more tests on the device to look at the way it affects specific groups who could be more sensitive to radiation .
He says children and passengers with gene mutations - around one in 20 of the population - are more at risk as they are less able to repair X - ray damage to their DNA .
Dr Brenner , who is originally from Liverpool but now works at the New York university , said : ' The individual risks associated with X - ray backscatter scanners are probably extremely small .
' If all 800 million people who use airports every year were screened with X - rays then the very small individual risk multiplied by the large number of screened people might imply a potential public health or societal risk .
The population risk has the potential to be significant . '
Following trials , the airport scanners were officially introduced at Manchester Airport in January , at Heathrow Terminal 4 in February and at Gatwick in May this year .
The most likely risk from the airport scanners is a common type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma , according to the academic .
The cancer is usually curable and often occurs in the head and neck of people aged between 50 and 70 .
He points out it would be difficult to hide a weapon on the head or neck so proposes missing out that part of the body from the scanning process .
' If there are increases in cancers as a result of irradiation of children , they would most likely appear some decades in the future .
It would be prudent not to scan the head and neck , ' he added .
He recently aired his concerns to the Congressional Biomedical Caucus in the US - members of Congress who meet to exchange ideas on medical research .
Dr Brenner urged them to look at his concerns but said it was important to balance any health issues against passengers ' safety when flying .
He said : ' There really is no other technology around where we 're planning to X - ray such an enormous number of individuals .
It 's really unprecedented in the radiation world . '
Concerns : People are uneasy about their images being beamed to a private room away from their view
The Civil Aviation Authority , Department for Transport and Health Protection Agency insist that the technology is safe and say their tests show it would take 5,000 trips through the scanner to equal the dose of a single chest X -ray .
They said in the climate of high security , it is essential that security staff use ' all means possible ' to minimise risks to airline security .
The CAA said : ' The device has been approved for use within the UK by the Department for Transport and has been subjected to risk assessments from the Health Protection Agency .
' To put the issue in perspective , the radiation received from the scanning process is the equivalent to two minutes radiation received on a Transatlantic flight .
' Recent press publications have been a little alarmist and may have heightened concern in frequent travellers who may worry about their repeated exposure .
' Under current regulations , up to 5,000 scans per person per year can be conducted safely . '
Six - week - old Faith Lovemore died after her mother , Julia , stuffed bits of Bible pages into the baby 's mouth and sat on her .
A judge says she was " profoundly mentally disordered and suffering from religious delusions at the time . "
Yeah .

Julia Lovemore , 41 , has been detained indefinitely under the mental health act after admitting the manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility after her lawyer described her as being in " a florid state of psychoses " at the time .
She suffers from bi-polar effective disorder and has suffered at least three psychotic episodes ; the judge ruled that this caused " grandiose delusions of special powers , religious delusions of identity and auditory hallucinations . "
The day of the killing , both a social worker and a psychiatric nurse had visited the home because , authorities had been concerned about the behavior of Lovemore 's husband David , 39 - " also a mentally - ill religious fanatic " , the court heard . "
There had been previous reports of Julia hitting her elder daughter with a hairbrush , and the children were on the " at risk " register .
In February 2009 , a psychiatrist described Julias as " at high risk " of another psychotic episode .
When social workers arrived , they found the father " praying loudly and shouting ' Take the devil out of Julia . ' "
Feeling they were making the man more agitated , ( and presumably concerned for the older daughter ) they apparently went to get backup - and a few hours later , David carried the baby 's body into a surgery .
It 's thought Faith was already dead in the other room at the time of the visit .

The prosecution has suggested that the couples ' extreme religious beliefs , in combination with their mental illness , made for an especially dangerous atmosphere , saying , ' With hindsight it was judged both parents were deteriorating sharply .
Profound mental ill health and engagement with religious beliefs turned out to be an explosive cocktail . "
The social workers had been considering an order of protection when they visited the home ; tragically , the intervention came too late .
An independent probe has found that social workers " underestimated " the parents ' illness and that " the link between [ mental illness and religious extremism ] was not sufficiently articulated . "
However , the Cambridgeshire Local Safeguarding Children Board Vice Chairman defends their social workers , saying it was an exceptional situation with a tragic outcome .
" The circumstances around this death were exceptional .
There were complex issues within the family around mental health , and the practice of their religious beliefs . "
While it would be a mistake to ascribe the tragedy to religion rather than mental illness , it 's interesting that authorities are applying special scrutiny to the intersection of mental illness and religious fervor : in combination , these things can indeed be a red flag .
According to the Daily Telegraph , when social workers initially met with David Lovemore for assessment in 2009 , " when he was asked what he would do if Faith or her sister got into difficulty he said he would pray first .
He never said yes or no to calling a doctor . "
Additionally , Julia 's aunt told authorities that her niece 's " religious fervor " had distanced her from her family , whom she denounced as " heathens . "
In combination , these things cannot be dismissed as " the practice of religious beliefs " - at least not where children 's welfare is concerned .

That installation requires that the broken existing riser that connects to the Blowout Preventer ( BOP ) has to be removed .
The bent riser has been exerting some lateral pressure on the BOP , and this might be relieved when it is cut off .
To minimize the damage , the first cut is therefore going to be further down the riser , provided that they get the saw " unstuck , " which it seems like they might have done , but no word yet on when cutting is to resume .
UPDATE : 5 pm Wednesday : I have added new material explaining how the diamond wire blunted , and how they might have fixed it , but now wo n't .
They are going back to the Shear . )
UPDATE : 1 am Thursday : New plan .
They are going to go with the big shears instead of the diamond saw for the cut .
I have been intermittently watching for the past couple of hours , while doing something else - they were prepping the Shear , and I think reconnecting the power lines from the Shear to the power pack .
Now , I believe that they are lowering the ensemble to the riser on CNN .
UPDATE : 10:30 am : The riser is cut , now on to the Top Hat / LMRP / " containment cap , " or whatever they 're calling it now , seating .
( My post continues after the video .
Please click , " There 's more " . )
VIDEO BELOW FOLD
The Lower Riser Assembly attached to the top of the BOP , the riser has folded over to the left .
10:04 am just before the pipe was severed .
The wire saw was then located ready to make the cut .
10:30 am Wire saw on riser
First shear location
Wire sawing the riser .
Possibly jammed wire at 12:30 am
The technician said that rather than trying again with the saw , the plan now was to use a large shear to cut the riser .
The shear , which is about 20 feet long and nearly 10 feet high , was used to make an earlier cut in the riser about 50 feet from the wellhead .
Because the shear will not make as clean a cut as the wire saw , modifications would have to be made to the containment cap that is to be lowered over the cut pipe .
But the technician said that even with the switch to the shear and the modifications , he expected the containment cap could be in place by Thursday .
ASJ cuts of casing from the bottom of the North Sea
I described the plan of attack in an earlier post , and what has happened , over the course of today has tried to follow that script .
I say tried , because there have been a couple of glitches that developed over the course of the day .
The large shearing machine ( apparently owned by BTI ) appeared on the scene , and in preparation for its use some of the pipes surrounding the main riser ( the choke and kill lines ) were first cut away using a diamond saw .
At the same time that this was going on , the wire saw that would make the final cut on the riser had been brought down to the site .
The riser assembly has been cleaned of extraneous pipes already , and the wire saw would fit about the flange and below the bend .
It was now time for the shearing machine ( which I ’m going to call a Shear from now on ) to fit around the riser and to make the first cut through the pipe .
Unfortunately the first cut did not appear successful , although there was a cloud of oil and gas released , indicating that the riser was at least breached .
There was a pause , and the Shear moved to a new location closer to the riser .
Again it tried to shear through the nest of pipes , that now included choke and kill lines .
It was not successful , and returned to the surface where it was fixed , and returned to the site .
UPDATE 1 : Having written this post and not seeing much happening I went off for a couple of hours .
On my return ( and before Gail posted it ) , I did not check again and as the notes below show , the Shear worked at 7 pm .
At 10:15 pm the wire saw was cutting through the riser .
I apologize for the errors .END of UPDATE 1 UPDATE 2 below >
In the meanwhile , a little calculation , based on reports that the White House has announced that the removal of the riser and drill pipe that are protruding from the Blowout Preventer ( BOP ) of the Deepwater Horizon well in the Gulf may increase the amount of the petroleum leak by 20 % when the riser section is removed .
There are two immediately obvious reasons why this might be the case .
The first of these is that there is a small amount of oil that was leaking up through the drill pipe that extended beyond the broken riser .
That flow was one of the first things capped in the remedial effort .
It did not have much impact on the overall flow volume , since the flow merely backed up and increased the flow through the main crack in the riser , but there may be a small increment of flow when this channel is re-opened with the cut below the fold in the riser .
The greater change in the flow , however , will likely come because the riser and DP , while not providing much increased resistance , did raise the pressure on the downstream side of the BOP by about 500 psi .
We know that though the pressure down at the formation was at around 12,000 psi , up on the upstream side of the BOP it fluctuates in the 8,000 to 9,000 psi range .
The higher resistance on the downstream side , reduces the pressure drop across the BOP by that 500 psi , and the flow rate will be reduced accordingly ( the gap size through the BOP is assumed not to change ) .
However , if the pressure drop across the nozzle was at 6,000 psi in the current condition , ( which with an orifice size of 0.6 inches , would give a flow rate of 512 gpm ) , then raising the pressure drop by 500 psi would only increase the flow rate to 532 gpm , or a difference of 4 % -- which might suggest that there is something about the drill - pipe flow that was initially capped which we do n’t know yet .
Alternately it may be that they think that removing the bend in the riser might ease the forces on the BOP , relaxing the metal a little and increasing the orifice size .
After all it has only to open up by another 0.05 inches to give the increase in flow that the White House are predicting .
UPDATE 2 : Sometime about midnight it appears that the cutting wire stopped moving and may be jammed in the cut , roughly half - way through .
UPDATE 3 I went to bed and have just checked the comments and it does not appear , at 8:00 am that the saw restarted , and finished cutting the riser .
At present the ROV is looking at the end of the riser , and the Shear .
Oil and gas from the cut seems to be coming up around the end making it indistinct .
Does anyone have a better version of what went on overnight ?
UPDATE 4 : On other feeds they are showing that a second cut is now being made by the wire saw , but the camera is further away .
BP is predicting that the cut will be completed today and the LMRP installed .
But it does n't look good that they are still working with the Shear , because they can't use that for a final cut , and it implies that they may be having problems with the second cut also .
UPDATE 5 : Part of the problem was apparently according to a BP spokesman that the cut through the first half had dulled the blade , so that when they got it restarted it would not cut .
( What we do in those circumstances , which are not uncommon with diamond blades , is to run the blade through firebrick , and this erodes the material into which the diamonds have been pushed , and sharpen it .
Then we drop the cutting pressure a little . )
However , BP 's current answer is going to beOh , and I mentioned earlier that an ASJ system had cut through casing and pipes at the bottom of the North Sea .
I had the orientation of that cut wrong ( at least for the picture below ) since in this case it was from the outside in , but I am aware of it being successful the other way .
And so here is the picture of casing and cement cut by an ASJ .
Sadly it was so long ago - around 23 years , that I can no longer remember exactly the pressure it was cut at , but I believe it was 5,000 psi .
And to answer a comment because the nozzle is non-contact , the surfaces it is cutting do n't have to be cylindrical .
White Plains , New York ( CNN ) --
Alleged drug kingpin Christopher " Dudus " Coke was extradited Thursday from Jamaica to the United States , where he is to face drug and weapons charges .
His extradition occurred two days after he was taken into custody in Jamaica and several hours after he had waived his right to an extradition hearing in Jamaica .
Coke arrived at about 7 p.m. at White Plains - Westchester County Airport outside New York City .
As a phalanx of armed Drug Enforcement Administration agents and U.S. marshals paraded him in front of about a dozen reporters to a silver SUV outside the terminal , Coke -- dressed in a blue open - necked shirt and black pants , his hands cuffed behind his back -- appeared subdued , a smirk on his face .
" I love the people of Jamaica , " he said in response to a question from a Jamaican reporter .
A DEA agent said he was to be taken to New York City and arraigned Friday in federal court in Manhattan .
Prior to his departure from Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston , he said in a statement that he had made the decision to waive his right to an extradition hearing of his own free will , and did so " even though I am of the belief that my case would have been successfully argued in the courts of Jamaica . "
According to a superseding indictment filed in Manhattan federal court , Coke has led a criminal organization known as the " Shower Posse " since the early 1990s , with members in the United States , Jamaica and other countries .
" At Coke 's direction and under his protection , members of his criminal organization sold marijuana and crack cocaine in the New York area and elsewhere , and sent the narcotics proceeds back to Coke and his co-conspirators , " the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York said in a statement .
" Coke and his co-conspirators also armed their organization with illegally trafficked firearms , " the statement said .
Coke , 40 , is charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine and marijuana and conspiracy to illegally traffic in firearms .
If convicted on the narcotics charge , he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison and a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison , as well as a fine of up to $ 4 million .
He faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on the firearms trafficking charge and a fine of up to $ 250,000 .
Coke was arrested on Tuesday when Jamaican police recognized him at a checkpoint .
Last month 's failed attempt to arrest Coke sparked four days of gunbattles between security forces and his supporters in Kingston that left 76 people dead .
Coke , who is also known as " President , " " Shortman " and " General , " said he was " deeply upset and saddened by the unnecessary loss of lives " and said the deaths " could have been avoided . "
" Everyone , the whole country , has been adversely affected by the process that has surrounded my extradition and I hope that my action today will go some way towards healing all who have suffered and will be of benefit to the community of Tivoli Gardens , " a neighborhood where violence erupted , he said .
He said his decision to face charges in the United States was made in " the best interest of my family , community of Western Kingston and in particular the people of Tivoli Gardens and above all Jamaica . "
He was leaving his country with " a heavy heart " and is " fully confident that in due course I will be vindicated . "
" Pray for me and God bless Jamaica , " he said .
A Jamaican opposition member , Peter Phillips , noted that since Tuesday 's arrest there had been little unrest in Coke strongholds -- the neighborhoods of West Kingston and Tivoli Gardens .
The member of parliament and former national security minister attributed the calm to the fact that the government had declared a state of emergency and troops were in the streets .
But the U.S. State Department issued a travel alert for U.S. citizens planning to visit Jamaica , updating one that had been issued June 15 .
" U.S. citizens are urged to exercise heightened security awareness and maintain a low profile , " it said .
Phillips called for the appointment of an investigative commission to probe whether the ruling Labor Party may have tried to " prevent and frustrate the extradition request . "
Jamaicans deserve to " understand the activities that took place , and the apparent conduct of members of government on the political and the administrative side , " Phillips said .
" We need to know if there was an attempt to obstruct justice on behalf of the government . "
Newspaper polls suggest most Jamaicans believe the government mishandled the extradition request , he said .
" There are still questions left to be answered , " he said .
" We need a commission to look at all dimensions of this . "
Coke has maintained a heroic reputation in the Kingston slums , with some people comparing him to Robin Hood , Jesus and one - time Colombian kingpin Pablo Escobar .
His popularity stemmed from his community efforts , including handing out food , sending children to school and building medical centers .
But drug enforcement officials say he deserves to be classified as one of the world 's most dangerous drug lords .

After six months in the International Space Station , two astronauts , a Russian and an American , returned to earth on Thursday , March 18th , 2010 in the Soyuz TMZ - 16 .
The Soyuz dropped into four feet of snow in a remote region of Kazakhstan .
NASA photographer Bill Ingalls , who has been shooting for NASA since 1991 , says that one of the hardest parts of shooting a landing is trying to catch the rockets on the spacecraft that are supposed to fire milliseconds prior to landing , in order to cushion it .
Ingalls arrived in the first group of recovery helicopters on the scene that circle the landing zone .
The same snow that blocked the ground recovery vehicles from reaching the Soyuz also made it difficult for Ingalls to tell how high above the ground the it was , and when the rockets would fire .
He shot at a high shutter speed using motor drive to capture it all .
Ingalls had made his shot , but for the astronauts , the journey was hardly over .
Coming all the way from outer space back to earth is only part of the commute from the Space Station .
After recovery from the snow at the landing site near Arkalyk , these hardy spacemen then traveled two and a half hours by helicopter to Kustanay , Kazakhstan .
There they participated in a ceremony at the airport , where the locals presented them with traditional hats .
Then they hopped on a plane for another two and a half hour ride before finally coming to rest at Star City , outside of Moscow .

The mysterious object was the anchor he was salvaging from the USS Powell for a Second World War memorial .
The video , which has been viewed more than 200,000 times on YouTube , also has an explanation .
Close examination found that it shows an encounter with a sea turtle , who mistook the camera for a meal and inadvertently switched it on .
The date is January – two months after the camera was lost and Mr Shultz 's best guess is that it happened off the coast of Honduras .
Hydrocarbon lakes on Titan may harbour exotic forms of life ( Illustration : NASA / JPL )
Two potential signatures of life on Saturn ’s moon Titan have been found by the Cassini spacecraft .
But scientists are quick to point out that non-biological chemical reactions could also be behind the observations .
Titan is much too cold to support liquid water on its surface , but some scientists have suggested that exotic life - forms could live in the lakes of liquid methane or ethane that dot the moon ’s surface .
In 2005 , Chris McKay of NASA ’s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field and Heather R Smith of the International Space University in Strasbourg , France , calculated that such microbes could eke out an existence by breathing in hydrogen gas and eating the organic molecule acetylene , creating methane in the process .
This would result in a lack of acetylene on Titan and a depletion of hydrogen close to the moon ’s surface , where the microbes would live , they said .
Advertisement
Now , measurements from the Cassini spacecraft have borne out these predictions , hinting that life may be present .
Hungry for hydrogen
Infrared spectra of Titan ’s surface taken with the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer ( VIMS ) showed no sign of acetylene , even though ultraviolet sunlight should constantly trigger its production in the moon ’s thick atmosphere .
The VIMS study , led by Roger Clark of the US Geological Survey in Denver , Colorado , will appear in the Journal of Geophysical Research .
Cassini measurements also suggest hydrogen is disappearing near Titan ’s surface , according to a study to appear in Icarus by Darrell Strobel of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , Maryland .
Observations with the spacecraft ’s Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer and its Composite Infrared Spectrometer revealed that hydrogen produced by UV - triggered chemical reactions in the atmosphere is flowing both upwards and off into space as well as down towards the surface .
Yet the hydrogen is not accumulating near the surface , hinting that something may be consuming it there .
The results reveal “ very unusual and currently unexplained chemistry ” , McKay told New Scientist .
“ Certainly not proof of life , but very interesting . ”
Too slow
It is possible that the hydrogen is combining with carbon in molecules on Titan ’s surface to make methane .
But at the low temperatures prevalent on Titan , these reactions would normally occur too slowly to account for the disappearing hydrogen .
Similarly , non-biological chemical reactions could transform acetylene into benzene – a hydrocarbon that the VIMS instrument did observe on Titan ’s surface .
But in that case , too , a catalyst would be needed to boost reaction rates enough to account for the dearth of acetylene .
“ Scientific conservatism suggests that a biological explanation should be the last choice after all non-biological explanations are addressed , ” says Mark Allen of NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California .
“ We have a lot of work to do to rule out possible non-biological explanations . ”
Jonathan Lunine of the University of Arizona in Tucson , a member of Clark ’s team , agrees .
But he says it may not be possible to distinguish between biological and non-biological explanations without additional missions to Titan .
“ The only way to know for sure would be to actually get hold of an organism and show that it is alive , ” he told New Scientist .

Russia is the sixth - largest economy in the world , but it ’s also a country relatively untouched by foreign investors , especially investors in technology .
Could Russia potentially be the home of the next massive tech boom ?
The short answer is : No way .
At least not anytime soon .
That ’s the conclusion I ’ve come to after a week in Moscow , a week in which I took part in the first ever delegation of US venture capital investors to visit Russia .
The organizers invited me as the sole member of the U.S. media .
( Disclosure :
My trip was organized by AmBar , a group of U.S. - based Russian professionals , and paid for by Rusnano , a government investment fund .
In return , I promised to write an honest account of what I found . )
Russia is making huge efforts to change .
It is plowing billions of dollars into the planned high - tech city of Skolkovo over the next couple of years that it hopes will replicate Silicon Valley .
Through $ 5 billion in other investments , it also plans to produce a $ 30 billion nanotechnology industry by 2015 .
Russian leaders , led by President Dmitry Medvedev , have convinced me they want to clean up corruption and that the only way they can achieve sustained economic growth is to diversify , and that means supporting the tech industry .
Russia is trying hard to reform and progress .
My brief visit makes me think it will get there .
Eventually .
But right now , Russia is still a mess .
It is totally reliant on its oil wealth , and as prices for oil inch upward again , Russia may once more gain comfort and lose the urgency to change .
It has a long way to go , and much of its plans are being implemented through Soviet - style top - down government mandates .
The government needs to reduce its size drastically and let personal initiative take over .
“ It ’s the people , stupid , ” U.S. angel investor Esther Dyson , one of the earliest successful investors in Russia , said to me ( see our video below ) .
Granted , the buzz is good
During our visit , we met with government officials , investors , parliamentarians , incubators and startups .
I tagged along with 20 other investors .
We also met several of the nation ’s wealthiest tycoons , including the richest “ oligarch , ” Michael Prokhorov ( pictured below right ) , who refused to do a video interview with me .
Independently , I also organized a meetup of startups at the Ritz Hotel , just off Moscow ’s Red Square .
Some 45 entrepreneurs showed up .
These guys are experimenting in all kinds of areas , but most of them are still focused on the Russian market .
Still , there ’s plenty of innovation evident here :
Just a couple of examples :
One company , Innosystems , has built a widget that lets you click a number to call online , with no software download .
Another , QiwiPay , backed by Moscow - based venture capital firm DST , is building kiosks that let Russians pay their traffic violation fines automatically — so they can avoid waiting in line in court for a day , or worse , being shaken down by police soliciting bribes .
I met others doing harder core stuff , such as Light Engines , which has a sophisticated lighting technology — although it is hardware , not the stuff Silicon Valley typically invests in .
Now , of course , I ’d be delighted if I could report that this Russia is the next India , China or Israel — all places that have seen massive foreign investment in recent years .
Russia has among the highest per capita number of students in the world , boasts high levels of mathematics and science education , and being in desperate need of modernization , you ’d think Russia would be a gold mine for investors .
President Dmitry Medvedev greeted the delegation , and made clear that technology is needed to diversify from Russian oil , gas and metals — which make up 80 percent of Russia ’s total exports .
That legacy industry is highly influenced by a group of about 22 so - called oligarchs — many of them exerting their power behind the scenes through corruption .
Technology entrepreneurship , if it is fostered , will lead to positive change — there is no question .
Everyone agrees .
But investing in Russia can be “ insanity ”
The more time I spent in Russia , the more complex the story became ( and I ’m not the first to say that about Russia ) .
The more I learned — about corruption , the abuses of the courts , the terribly archaic educational system , the choked up traffic , the lack of investment in infrastructure , the cultural penchant for Hobbesian brute leaders , the lack of a truly independent media , and the assassination of journalists when they do show independence — the harder it is for me see a positive short - term future for U.S. - style tech investment for this country .
If you ’re considering investing in Russia , you may want to check out the history of Bill Browder ( pictured left ) , the American investor whose firm , Hermitage Capital , emerged as the leading foreign investor in the 1990s and mid 2000s , with $ 4 billion under management .
Hermitage documented corruption within some of the companies he invested in in Russia ’s most tightly controlled oil and gas industries and exposed it to the media , and some of the oligarchs took umbrage .
These were some of the biggest oil and gas companies in the world , including Gasprom .
Beginning in 2006 , his operations were expropriated by tax authorities operating with support from the Russian government , and he was declared a “ risk to national security . ”
There ’s eye - opening background in this two - part video series ( Part I and Part II , and especially this longer video ) .
His case is ongoing .
Late last year , Browder ’s attorney in Russia died after apparently being tortured while being held in jail by Russian authorities .
Browder , who is in exile in London , has won a pledge from Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to launch a criminal investigation into the case .
Any venture capital investment in Russia would amount to “ complete insanity , ” he said last week .
His is n’t an isolated case .
U.S. investors I ’ve spoken , including Esther Dyson , have also heard of stories of “ stripping ” — that is , where private assets are stripped from their owner and reassigned to a government agency .
However , most people I talked with suggested the practice is on the decline .
Yet Russia is a riddle , wrapped in a mystery … .
Little is clear - cut in Russia .
For every negative fact , there ’s a positive one that provides balance .
The trends are all very good .
Compared to 10 years ago , criminality has declined significantly .
It ’s now safer to walk around for foreign investors .
Peter Loukianoff , an investor with Almaz Capital Partners , one of the first Russian venture firms focused on IT , left the country in the mid-1990s , because of a rash of assassinations including foreigners , but he ’s now back and doing business .
True , corruption is still rampant :
He knows of companies that get a call from the “ fire department ” demanding increases in “ tax payments . ”
One company he knows of — a copier distributor — pays up to 40 percent of its profit toward this unofficial tax , he said .
If you trade in physical goods , you ’re more vulnerable , agrees Drew Guff , leader of one of the first private equity firms in Russia , who just announced an investment of $ 250 million to support Russia ’s high - tech city project .
It ’s harder for Russian extortionists to track goods if you ’re dealing in e-commerce .
Here ’s a perverse logic in Russia I heard expressed by several people : “ What ’s wrong with an extra few points of corruption tax if your base income tax is only 13 percent ? ”
It ’s true that the taxes in Russia are relatively low , but that means the state , including the police offers and other government agencies , are constantly on the prowl for funds , and they use this to internally justify their thievery .
Ironically , though , there ’s another Russian quirk that may help the likes of Hermitage find justice .
Russia is one of the more bureaucratic countries in the world , with most transactions and legal actions filed at four different ministries .
So remarkably , the details of the crackdown on Hermitage , documented in the scores of pleas made by Browder ’s lawyer before he died in jail , are all safely recorded .
It will be difficult for Russian leaders to erase evidence of what happened .
Privatization and reform will make it even harder for the thugs to rule .
Yuri Soloviev , chief executive of VTB Capital , another VC firm in Russia supported in part by the Russian government , told us he once fought thugs from the fire department trying to tax his car business .
But he says continued privatization — 2,000 government enterprises will be privatized over the next couple of years — will drive out corruption because it will give preying officials fewer places to hide .
Reform has also led to higher levels of corporate governance , he said .
There are other signs of steady improvements .
The problem is it ’s all from a very low base level .
Take education .
Political officials constantly bribe teachers to get their kids into the best schools .
Some 40 percent of university students say they face “ regular ” corruption , according to a survey cited by Sergey Guriev , rector of the New Economic School in Russia , in a talk with us .
This , he said , has compromised the moral fiber of a whole generation of faculty and students .
Quality of education in Russia ’s strongest field , mathematics , is on the decline .
However , the government , again backed by the reform - minded Medvedev ( pictured left in the image above , with Putin ) , is pushing through standardized tests , and grading will be distributed regionally , which will help cut down on opportunities to bribe .
Medvedev , the prince of hope ?
So who is this progressive leader , President Medvedev ?
No one knows how powerful he is , because he won elections only after Vladimir Putin termed out of the presidential spot .
Putin had consolidated most of Russian power under his leadership and remains prime minister .
Both men may run for president in 2012 , which is when Russian watchers say the real test will come between the two men .
Medvedev appeals to a more liberal demographic in Russia , while the thuggish Putin appeals to conservatives .
Medvedev , a former law professor , is seen as a strong ally of the U.S.
Next month , Medvedev will visit Silicon Valley to learn more about the tech region as he goes about helping guide more than $ 2 billion in investments into the scientific city called Skolkovo just outside Moscow .
Medvedev has also complained about Russia ’s lack of venture capital :
The $ 2 billion managed by the nation ’s 20 venture capital capital firms is “ almost nothing , ” he complains .
He realizes the need for external VC investors , not merely for money , but for advice too .
Still , some question Medvedev ’s fortitude in making change happen .
For sure , there ’s little sign he ’ll be changing Russia ’s top - down approach .
One eye - opening example of Russia ’s tendency to “ plan ” is the government ’s investment of $ 5 billion in nanotechnology .
The project drew skepticism from American investors during the visit last week , especially when it became clear that the Russian definition of “ nano ” is still murky .
One joke is that entrepreneurs are throwing the word “ nano ” into their business plan and getting funding .
The Skolkovo project , however , is the most intriguing example ( see good overview of the project here ) .
Run by one of Russia ’s oil oligarchs , Viktor Vekselberg ( pictured left ) , reportedly a billionaire , the project entails building an “ innovation city ” from scratch and making it home to 20,000 people — complete with perimeter - wide security , clean - tech buildings , schools , healthcare and entertainment .
He took questions — many of them skeptical — from members of the U.S. delegation .
They told him it was “ all about the people . ”
Innovation needs to bubble up , and government needs to get out of the way , the U.S. investors who were with me repeated over and over again .
Vekselberg said he is negotiating letters of intent with Cisco and Nokia and is also talking with MIT , Siemens , Microsoft and Google to see if they too will agree to shift their R&D activities to the city .
An extensive post - graduate institution and an incubator for startups are also planned .
Russia ’s patriarchal nature — where the state takes care of things — is surprisingly ingrained .
“ Russians want a czar , ” said Leonid Gozman , board member of the Russian government investment group Rusnano , explaining one line of Russian outlook .
“ They found their czar in Putin , and they love him . ”
[ Update : Gozman insists I quoted him out of context here .
He says he intended to say this perception of Russians is actually a “ myth . ” I stand corrected . ]
It ’s often explained this way : Russia ’s unwieldy size , and its descent into instability whenever central power falters , has left many Russians craving strong leaders .
A majority of Russians listed Stalin as the “ greatest leader ” in Russian history in a mass survey conducted in 2005 .
And yet , most Russians I talked with said they do n’t actually like Putin .
One cab driver , when asked whether he supported Putin or not , told me he was too scared to talk about his views — apparently out of fear of reprisals .
While Russians respect authority , they also fear it .
The corrupt police force exacerbates this .
On average , Russian police officers make less than $ 400 a month , which encourages them to take things into their own hands :
One small - business owner I talked with said his greatest fear is of corrupt police pulling him aside , planting drugs in his car and demanding a pay - off of up to $ 2,000 .
This sort of thing is a regular occurrence .
Here too , though , there ’s relief on the way .
The government , led by Medvedev , has pledged to triple police monthly salaries to $ 1,195 by the end of the year .
So where does this leave us ?
Both economically and politically , the country has a long way to go .
On the economic front , Patricia Cloherty , CEO of Delta Private Equity Partners , one of the earliest U.S. investors in Russia , says there ’s massive opportunity in modernizing Russia ’s economy , but it ’s all in traditional industries , not in high - tech startups .
Her firm has pumped $ 500 M in 55 companies since 1994 , and there are signs of growth everywhere , she said .
Russians bought 7 million cell phones in the first quarter of 2010 alone , up from 1995 when there were just 93,000 in existence .
Hundreds of shopping malls have been built in Russia , up from just two in 1995 .
But she cautioned about investing in innovation , saying is should be “ avoided . ”
Risks such as weak intellectual property laws are likely to stymie such projects .
That ’s why many U.S. tech investors continue to scour Russian universities to find technology for export to the U.S. for commercialization .
Politically , the consensus here is that Medvedev and Putin will push for progress … slowly .
There ’s broad confidence Russia is headed in the right direction , but everyone says it could take years .
I had dinner with Yuri Milner of DST , the largest Russian investor in U.S. startups , and he took a pass when I asked him about plans to invest in Russia , and about Medvedev ’s resolve to push forward reform ( see video below ) .
My own view is that it will take at least five years before things improve enough for U.S. venture funds to look at Russia seriously .
And it ca n’t come until the state steps out of the way .
If you listen to Medvedev , though , there ’s no urgency to do that .
He said he wants foreigners to understand Russia ’s top - down approach : “ That ’s how our society has worked since the days of the patriarch .

A LONDON pub claims to have video footage of notorious street artist Banksy spraying his latest masterpiece in their beer garden .
CCTV cameras at the Princess of Wales pub in Primrose Hill captured a hooded man spraying a Banksy - style mural during the early hours .
The owners believe it to be the handiwork of the famous street artist , whose work has sold for hundred of thousands of dollars , and have decided to let the image stay .

" It looks very good .
My husband was going to paint over it and people came in and said , ' Do n’t touch it !'
Everybody thinks it ’s pretty much real , " landlady Karen Santi told Sky News .
Ms Santi said there is ongoing rivalry between Banksy and a local street artist , which could have prompted the new graffiti .
The artwork is painted over an outside wall covered in pictures and mirrors and shows a lion facing a little girl who is holding a heart - shaped balloon .
In a mirror above the lion , the message " Run for your lives !!! " is spelled out in red paint .
The CCTV footage recorded a man in a hooded top entering the beer garden on just before 1am .
He could be seen arranging a light to allow him to work and standing back to inspect the mural .
Mrs Santi said the artist could have entered the garden through a gate accidentally left open .
Banksy 's real name has reported to be Robin Gunningham and is thought to have been born in Bristol in 1974 .
His artwork , including exhibitions , animatronics and embarrassing Paris Hilton , has been displayed around the world .
Melbourne Council recently inadvertently painted over a priceless piece of Banksy street art .
The council ’s anti-graffiti crew painted over what is believed to be the only remaining work by the enigmatic British artist left in the city by mistake .
Banksy 's first film , Exit Through the Gift Shop , billed as " the world 's first street art disaster movie " , made its debut at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival .

To a foreigner , the Canadian police are a confusing bunch .
With Toronto locked down for the G20 summit , several of them have been cycling around the deserted streets on mountain bikes presenting what we would see as the very picture of community policing .
Yet side by side with this benign image is an intimidating , militarised presence that many Canadians feel has been deliberately cultivated in order to undermine their right to protest against the G20 and its damaging impacts .
The security operation on the streets of Toronto has provided Canadians with the greatest single talking point of the G20 gathering this weekend .
Many locals are furious at the $ 1bn price tag for policing a summit which they never wanted to host in the first place .
As John Clarke of the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty pointed out , that same money could have paid for five years of the provincial food supplement programme that has just been scrapped in the latest round of austerity cuts .
The high level of militarisation that has been witnessed over the past couple of days has also been a major talking point , as Canadians are not accustomed to seeing such weaponry being so openly paraded at civil demonstrations .
One small protest against poverty and homelessness in Toronto itself was quickly surrounded by vast numbers of police in full riot gear , including mounted police .
More chilling still was the visible presence of heavily armed officers touting tear gas rifles and other firearms ; police have also confirmed firing plastic bullets and pepper spray capsules at demonstrators on Saturday night .
Many Canadians have become suspicious of police tactics since the Quebec police force admitted that it had disguised three of its own officers as rock - wielding anarchists in an attempt to provoke violence at a peaceful protest in the town of Montebello two years ago .
Somewhat farcically , the three were exposed as agents provocateurs when they were found to be wearing official issue police boots identical to those of the uniformed officers " arresting " them .
There are concerns that similar skulduggery may have played a part in Toronto this weekend , where the burning of three police cars quickly became the defining image of Saturday 's otherwise peaceful demonstration .
Questions are being asked as to why the police chose to drive the vehicles into the middle of a group of protesters and then abandon them , and why there was no attempt to put out the flames until the nation 's media had been given time to record the scenes for broadcast around the world .
The fact that so much attention has been directed towards the policing is largely due to the lack of anything newsworthy coming out of the summit itself .
Even David Cameron , attending for the first time as British prime minister , published his own desperate plea in the Canadian press this week for summits to be turned into something more than the hot air and photo opportunities they have been in the past .
( How this relates to his stated intention to take time out to watch the second half of the England v Germany game with Angela Merkel was not made clear . )
As an invitation - only club whose membership was literally drawn up on the back of an envelope , the G20 never laid any claim to legitimacy .
Now it is also in danger of losing any credibility as a forum for global economic governance .
Its failure to address any of the structural problems that caused the financial and economic crises of the past three years has certainly not gone unnoticed in Toronto , let alone its complete refusal to deal with the challenge of climate change .
Unbelievably , the G20 is scheduled to hold its next summit in just a few months .
If the Canadian experience has taught us anything , it is that such meetings are simply not worth the candle .
There are more than enough forums already available for national leaders to discuss the key issues of our time , and almost every one of them has a greater claim to openness and inclusivity than the G20 .
Now is the time to end the charade of these summits once and for all .
“ Hell Freezes Over ” at Westboro Protest
Plans by the notorious Westboro Baptist Church to protest the Resource Center Dallas , a northern Texas nonprofit that offers a variety of programs to LGBT and HIV - positive people , on July 9 have been turned into a fund - raiser .
The center has launched an initiative called “ Hell Freezes Over ” and is asking local residents to donate an amount of money for each minute the protesters plan to picket both the center and Beth El Binah , a mainstream Jewish congregation with a longtime LGBT outreach that meets at the center .
The center plans to use funds raised to buy a new ice machine for its meals program , which serves lunches to HIV - positive clients every weekday .
“ The protesters have been known to abandon their protests when they ’re turned into a fund - raiser , ” says Bret Camp , associate executive director for the center ’s health and medical services .
“ Whether the church shows up or not , this is a way for the North Texas community to stand with us against hate and help us with a timely need . ”

WASHINGTON
When the State of Georgia ran out of money to pay the lawyers for a man facing the death penalty , the prosecutor , of all people , had an idea .
He asked the judge to appoint two overworked public defenders instead , identifying them by name .
The judge went along .
The Georgia Supreme Court , by a 4 - to - 3 vote , endorsed the arrangement in March , saying the defendant , Jamie R. Weis , should have accepted the new lawyers to help solve the state ’s budget impasse .
The adversary system does not ordinarily let prosecutors pick their opponents .
Indeed , most states do not allow established relationships between lawyers and their clients to be interrupted for any but the most exceptional reasons .
Two states , Georgia and Louisiana , take a less sporting attitude , saying poor defendants may be forced to switch lawyers long after the case is under way and must take whomever the state can afford at the time .

Anarchism and the WSM
As the economic crisis continues , the WSM has been busy in a variety of campaigns against measures attempting to impose the costs of the crisis on workers and the poor .
WSM members in the public sector trade unions have been active in organising against cuts and pressing for a no vote in ballots on the “ Croke Park ” agreement .
We have also been involved in getting the anti-water charges campaigns up and running in both Dublin and Cork and attended a protest organised by these campaigns at the Green Party annual conference in Waterford .
Elsewhere , our Cork branch was instrumental in organising a very successful celebration of International Women ’s Day ( see article ) .
We also attended a solidarity protest in Castlerea in support of jailed Mayo fisherman , Pat O’Donnell ( see article ) .
There was also a WSM presence on a march seeking justice for Toyosi Shitta - Bey , the 15 - year - old schoolboy who died following a racist attack in Dublin 15 .
We have been making a number of efforts to further awareness of anarchism .
In Dublin , we have been running a series of educationals for those interested in anarchist ideas , covering anarchist thought , capitalism and the Russian Revolution .
Our outreach group commenced the “ Rethinking Revolution Discussion Series ” in the Seomra Spraoi social centre in Dublin 1 , which , according to their Facebook group , will aim to cover “ the core ideas those of us who want revolutionary change think we have in common and so too often neglect to discuss .
The discussions will be kicked off by an opinionated presentation of one or more approaches on these questions with the purpose of drawing all present into a discussion that we hope will continue long after the meeting . ”
We have republished two pamphlets ( see article ) , the first in a series of planned reprints of popular anarchist pamphlets .
The “ Rebel Worker ” news sheet has hit the streets in Cork again recently , produced by our branch in the city , while we continue our planning for the 2010 Anarchist Bookfair in Dublin to be held on May 29th ( see article ) .
Finally , the second edition of our show , “ Radio Solidarity ” , was broadcast recently on Near FM and is available to hear at http://www.nearpodcast.org/podcast/audio/podcast-2010-03-26-58991.mp3.
It covers NAMA , the economy , the Irish Glass Bottle Factory fiasco and the Shell to Sea campaign .
If you like what you read or hear and want to learn more about the WSM , then we would be delighted to hear from you .

Deal or No Deal -
It 's a Scrap Either Way
The long days and nights of bargaining between government and union top brass at Croke Park ended when the participants emerged and presented the fruits of their deliberations .
It is a pretty awful deal , which rubber stamped the pay cuts already handed out to public sector workers and added a whole layer of new working conditions , essentially extra hours and responsibilities for the same or lower pay .
Over the couple of weeks that followed , the various public sector unions in conference or at executive level recommended either accepting or rejecting this deal , with the final call resting with the membership .
As we go to print the final result of these ballots are still unknown but recent experience should warn us that , in either case , the battle is far from over .
Public Service Pay Deal - The Battle Lines are Drawn
Jack O’Connor walked out of the government talks and refused to recommend the deal , saying that :
“ From its inception the union was distinguished from its predecessors and contemporaries in trade unionism in Ireland by its militancy in organisation and in industrial action , its extension of membership to all sections of general workers to support other wage earners in weaker strategic positions , its vigour in fighting employers , its recourse to the sympathetic strike on the principle that an injury to one is the concern of all and its proclaiming as tainted goods , unclean and untouchable material in establishments in which its members or fellow workers were on strike or locked out ”
State Repression Continues in Mayo
Local Mayo fisherman , Pat O Donnell , was sentenced to seven months in Castlerea prison in March for his role in campaigning against the Corrib gas pipeline and the corrupt deal that has given
Shell access to Ireland ’s gas fields .
He has been consistently targeted by Shell and the Gardai , being falsely arrested on two occasions when Shell has attempted to carry out works in Mayo .
This intimidation reached a pinnacle last summer when Pat 's boat was boarded and then sank by four masked men .
When he continued to stand up for his community , the state stepped in and imprisoned O’Donnell .
He had the misfortune of living in the wrong place and not being part of the cosy cartel of businessmen , bankers and politicians who run this country .
A day out of the ordinary - The Dublin Anarchist Bookfair !
This May sees the return of the annual Anarchist Bookfair to Dublin , our fifth Bookfair to take place in the city to date .
Starting from humble beginnings in the St. Nicholas of Myra Hall in The Liberties five years ago , last years Bookfair was arguably the most successful to date .
Over one thousand people passed through Liberty Hall during the day with ten different meetings and workshops held discussing a wide range of topics ranging from Palestine to Left Unity , Iran to Shell to Sea , Social Centres and beyond .
Special quests included anarchist and ex-Black Panther Ashanti Alston and well renowned feminist and author of Mujeres Libres , Martha Ackelsberg .
Several thousand euros worth of books and pamphlets were purchased from stalls operated by the Workers Solidarity book service , Barracka Books , Just Books , AK Press , Anarchist Federation , Irish Socialist Network , Oxfam Bookstore and others .
Pamphlets and leaflets from a vast array of campaigns and political organisations , including the Revolutionary Anarcha - feminist Group , Shell to Sea , Residents Against Racism , Choice Ireland , Seomra Spraoi and Justice for Mumia Abu Jamal , were distributed freely .
The place was abuzz all day .
That 's Capitalism
In 2009 , “ 11 % of employers visited by welfare officials were not compliant with their PRSI commitments ” , according to the Department of Social and Family Affairs .
In plain English this means that they never paid PRSI to the government , as they are obliged to do .
When workers steal , it ’s ‘ theft ’ , when bosses do the same , it ’s ‘ non-compliance ’ .
Successful International Women ’s Day Celebration
The Workers Solidarity Movement ( WSM ) in Cork was delighted by the success of the Douglas Street Community Celebration of International Women ’s Day on Monday , 8th March .
The day comprised of fifty free , open events involving poetry , music , workshops , speakers , fortune tellers , performance art , a community dinner , knitting club , films , a community art exhibition and much more .
The celebration ran from 10 am to midnight at Solidarity Books and many other venues on and around Douglas Street .
Lessons of Pride
There will be celebrations of Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual and Transgendered ( LGBT ) Pride across Ireland this summer , including Cork 's Pride Parade on June 5th and Dublin 's Parade on June 26th .
The original Pride marches were held to commemorate the Stonewall riots in New York which began on June 28 , 1969 , and which were led mainly by working class Black and Puerto Rican trans people , butch dykes and drag queens sick of being beaten up and arrested by the police .
The following year , in commemoration of the riots , the Gay Liberation Front organised a march from Greenwich Village to Central Park .
Almost 10,000 women and men attended the march .
Today , many major cities all over the world hold LGBT / Queer Pride Marches on the last Sunday of June in honour of Stonewall .
Iranian Protesters at War with God
On Monday November 9th last year , news of the impending execution of Ehsan Fattahian , a 28 - year - old Iranian political activist of Kurdish origins , began reaching the outside world .
Human rights groups , caught unaware , began a frantic effort to halt the execution .
Thinking About Anarchism - Should the Catholic Church remain in control of our schools ?
Despite the Catholic hierarchy ’s shameful efforts to silence the survivors of abuse , we now have some idea of what was happening behind the walls of church - run institutions across Ireland .
In the wake of this , many people have begun asking whether the Catholic Church should continue to have any control whatsoever over state - funded education .
As it stands , the Church still control 92 % of primary schools .
However a MRBI / Irish Times poll in January of this year found that a majority of Irish people now want this situation remedied .
The Church is understandably reluctant to cede one of the most important sources of its power and has launched a series of media and policy initiatives over the past few months with the aim of retrenching themselves within the schooling system , albeit on a smaller scale than before ( 1 ) .
Given the Church ’s response and the fact that there seems to be no end to the torrent of stories of abuse and attempted cover-ups , it is unlikely that this debate is going to finish anytime soon .
Beach bums , rejoice !
Slate ‘s Jonah Weiner has declared the return of the “ beach band , ” mostly in the form of Wavves , Beach Fossils , Beach House , Best Coast , and other artists whose names make you think of sun , sand , and surf .
( Never mind that Beach House does n’t sound like the others at all . )
Now , we know this is n’t a popular opinion in the summer of 2010 , but we listened to Wavves ’
King of the Beach a few times and could n’t believe the whole thing was n’t a stupid joke .
So , although we love some of these bands , we ’re mostly feeling nostalgic for the great beach albums of yore ( most of which , we admit , came out before we were born ) .
Reminisce with us as we count down ten classics after the jump .
The Beach Boys — Summer Days ( And Summer Nights ! ! ) ( 1965 ) Let ’s just get this out of the way :
No one is ever going to agree on which Beach Boys album is the quintessential beach record .
We would say just about any of their pre-1966 offerings ( although , do n’t get us wrong , in terms of general mind - blowingness , Pet Sounds wins every time ) could fit the bill .
So we went with the one that has “ California Girls ” — and “ Help Me , Rhonda ” — on it .
Accept no ( David Lee Roth ) substitutes .
Listen : “ California Girls ”
Lou Reed — Coney Island Baby ( 1975 )
Most classic beach albums come from California or , at the very least , reference that fun - in - the - sun sound .
But Lou Reed is New York through and through .
This record is wistful , backward - looking , softer than most of Reed ’s more experimental offerings , and perfect for a day in that syringe - laced Brooklyn sand .
Lester Bangs may have hated it , but our relationship with Reed is a little less complicated than his , and we ca n’t complain .
Listen : “ Coney Island Baby ”
The Surfaris — Wipe Out ( 1964 )
Although , these days , it ’s been relegated to oldies radio , The Surfaris ’ “ Wipe Out ” was kind of revolutionary for its time .
A rare rock instrumental hit ( well , except for that famous derisive opening , voiced by the band ’s manager , Dale Smallin ) , it was originally recorded as the B - side to “ Surfer Joe ” but soon eclipsed that song ’s success .
But that track , and the rest of this energetic album , have much to offer beyond “ Wipe Out ’s ” addictive hook .
Listen : “ Wipe Out ”
The Dictators — Go Girl Crazy !
( 1975 ) What , you thought The Ramones were the first New Yorkers to fuse punk and surf ?
Nope .
The Dictators earned that distinction in 1975 , before punk even formally existed .
And you know what else ?
On their debut , Go Girl Crazy ! , Handsome Dick Manitoba and friends covered “ California Sun ” years before Joey Ramone got his grubby hands on it .
But the true classic on this record is the greaser fantasy “ ( I Live for ) Cars and Girls , ” which rocks the boast , “ I leave ’em in another state whenever I accelerate . ”
Listen : “ ( I Live For ) Cars and Girls ”
The Go-Gos — Vacation ( 1982 ) Beauty and the Beat may remain The Go - Gos ’ best - known ( or simply best ) album , but the one we want on our beach blanket is most certainly Vacation .
“ Beatnik Beach ” is another seaside staple , but even the less specifically summer - oriented tunes are perfect for a party in the sand .
Watch : “ Beatnik Beach ”
The Ventures — Ventures in Space ( 1963 )
It ’s kind of impossible to choose between the thousands of wonderful albums in the prolific Ventures ’ early ’60s catalog .
So we ’re going with one of the weirdest :
The band ’s surfy tribute to the great unknown .
We have to assume that some of these strange , now - commonplace , sounds made their debut on this very record .
Listen : “ Moon Child ”
Man or Astro - Man ? — Is It… Man or Astro - Man ? ( 1993 ) Perhaps the heirs to The Ventures , Man or Astro - Man ?
were unquestionably the oddballs of the ’90s surf revival .
Instead of confining their love of kitsch to the realm of ’60s beach - party soundtracks , these wacky instrumentalists sample all manner of B - movie gems , from sci - fi cheese to biker bravado .
While their schtick eventually grew old , there ’s nothing quite like Man or Astro - Man ? ’s pleasantly bizarre debut .
Listen : “ Mermaid Love ”
The Honeys — The Honeys Collection ( 2000 ) Surfer dudes like The Beach Boys and Jan and Dean may have gotten all the attention , but we bet your parents will remember The Honeys .
Led by sisters Diane and Marilyn Rovell ( the latter was Brian Wilson ’s first wife ) , the group sang a catchy combo of surf - rock and Phil Spector - style girl - group pop .
Since they never managed to release a proper album , this recent comp is your best bet .
Listen : “ Shoot the Curl ”
Mr. Bungle — California ( 1999 ) Mike Patton ’s Mr. Bungle would never release an album that only referenced a single genre , so do n’t look for pure surf rock on the band ’s final studio release , California .
Although it ’s by far the group ’s most accessible full - length , it ’s a slightly more seamless version of the typical genre clusterfuck :
There ’s some metal , some Hawaiian sounds , some doo - wop , and some straight - up out - there experimental stuff .
This is what summer sounds like when you ’re a weirdo .
Listen : “ Air - Conditioned Nightmare ”
The B - 52s — s/t ( 1979 )
The bouncy synth beats of New Wave owe a great deal to the tube - amp sounds of ’ 60s surf — and nowhere is that clearer than on The B - 52s ’ self - titled debut .
The album ( which apparently counted John Lennon among its fans ) is full of gnarly bass lines , from “ Wipe Out ” cousin “ Planet Claire ” to oddball anthem “ Rock Lobster . ”
Watch : “ Rock Lobster ”
The Director of Public Prosecutions ( DPP ) has decided not to lay criminal charges against contractors accused of incorrectly installing ceiling insulation in Canberra homes .
Between November last year and January this year , insulation batts were installed in the Macarthur , Fadden and Lyneham homes under the Federal Government 's failed home insulation scheme .
Soon after , fire damaged the homes - in one instance , a blaze broke out on the same day .
During a coronial inquiry , a statement tendered to the court said each fire started as a result of incorrect installation .
It said batts were placed directly over down lights , leading to a build up of heat in the roof space .
No covers were used in the Lyneham or Fadden installations , and a cardboard guard was used in the Macarthur home .
Coroner Grant Lalor said in each of the cases there had been serious non compliance with Government safety advice .
He described one of the jobs as hurried and unprofessional .
In March the coroner referred the matter to the DPP saying he believed there may be enough evidence to charge the three installers .
Now the DPP has decided that no criminal charges will be laid on the material currently available .
It is expected the coroner will now complete his inquiry .

In light of the fact that the Nashville Predators had a difficult time winning faceoffs last season , I thought it might help to offer some further detail , along with suggestions as to how things might improve ( outside of bringing back Scott Nichol , that is ) .
Follow after the jump for a detailed analysis of the Nashville Predators ' performance at winning faceoffs , in a way I do n't think you 've seen before ...
The table below reflects the faceoff - winning performance of the main Nashville Predators , split by Even Strength , Power Play , and Shorthanded duty .
The " Weighted Performance " column reflects the overall results based on the number of faceoffs in each situation ( since , on average , you should win 55 % of PP draws and 45 % of SH , rather than 50 % ) .
For example , Jason Arnott took many more faceoffs on the power play than shorthanded , so his overall results should be north of 50 % .
Instead , he won 4.2 % fewer faceoffs than the NHL average for that workload .
EV PP SH Overall Weighted Player FO Taken Win % FO Taken Win % FO Taken Win % Win % Performance Jason Arnott 853 48.8 % 215 48.8 % 9 55.6 % 48.8 % 95.8 % David Legwand 886 48.5 % 99 50.5 % 139 41.7 % 47.9 % 96.1 % Jerred Smithson 409 54.3 % 11 63.6 % 128 56.3 % 54.9 % 112.3 % ( wow ! )
Marcel Goc 778 52.1 % 19 68.4 % 115 49.6 % 52.1 % 105.3 % Colin Wilson 98 49.0 % 26 53.8 % 50.0 % 97.9 % Cal O'Reilly 227 47.1 % 48 45.8 % 6 66.7 % 47.3 % 93.3 % Mike Santorelli 93 43.0 % 12 66.7 % 45.7 % 90.4 % Nick Spaling 88 44.3 % 7 0.0 % 41.0 % 82.7 % Dustin Boyd
( only NSH games ) 100 57.0 % 2 100.0 % 3 66.7 % 58.1 % 116.3 % Team Total 3723 49.5 % 519 48.6 % 446 47.3 % 49.2 % 98.2 %
First off , two words of caution .
The first is that for some of these cells , the sample size is too small to have confidence in them .
Secondly , the ability of wingers to battle for pucks drawn to the side has an impact on winning percentages , but this as close as we get to a one - on - one , measurable competitive situation in hockey .
Baseball , for example , lends itself much more easily to statistical analysis , because most of the action involves a series of individual activities ( fielding a ball hit to a given area of the diamond ) and matchups ( i.e. pitcher vs. hitter ) .
That said , let 's dig into the details here , zooming in on the top Preds in terms of overall faceoff work ( just so the graph does n't get too cluttered ) :
Here 's a breakdown of each of the main faceoff men based on the height ( in inches ) of their opponents .
The above chart is against left - handed shooting opponents only ( we 'll hit the righties below ) .
Roughly 75 % of all the faceoffs in this sample take place against opponents ranging from 71 - 74 inches in height ( 5 ' 11 " to 6 ' 2 " ) .
To trim the noise , I 've also excluded data points driven by fewer than 10 draws .
So what does this tell us ?
Colin Wilson has a lot of work to do on the dot .
Jason Arnott had a rough year across the board , consistently below 100 % .
Marcel Goc dominated guys his height ( 73 inches ) or taller
Jerred Smithson rocks the dot , especially against 6 ' opponents and shorter
And now , how they did against the righties ...
Note that this graph is wilder , because the sample size is smaller ( about 75 % of faceoffs were against lefties , only 25 % against righties ) .
I eliminated Colin Wilson from this one as he only had 32 faceoffs against right - handed opponents .
Still , a few observations can be made :
Jason Arnott does well against taller right - handed opponents .
This is useful , because for some reason the sample of right - handed opponents is taller in general than the lefties ( 61 % of them were above 6 ' ) .
Marcel Goc consistently was under 100 % here , arguing in favor of trying to match him up against lefties instead .
Again , Jerred Smithson rocks the dot .
It would appear that there may be an opportunity here for the Preds to improve their faceoff performance by taking advantage of these tendencies .
For example , it 's very common to have two of your main faceoff guys on a given line during key situations .
Jason Arnott could be paired with Marcel Goc , with Arnott given the job of facing righties , while Goc handles the lefties .
Against tall , right - handed centers , the instruction could be given to expect the other team to probably dominate faceoffs , allowing wingers to better anticipate the action .
Just based on offensive contribution , you can make the argument as to whether Goc should get some power play time for Nashville next season , but when you toss in his faceoff performance , that adds fuel to the fire .
Recall that the Predators had the worst FO Win % in the league on the power play this season .
Note : I have a to - do to bring prior seasons into this analysis , to see if these relationships hold up over time .
In the meantime , it 's something to chew on ...
Image caption Each of Britannia 's turbine blades will weigh more than 30 tonnes
Huge wind turbines with a span rivalling that of the London Eye could form part of the UK 's energy future .
The first giant offshore turbine , named Britannia , will be complete by 2012 .
It will tower 574ft ( 175 m ) above the North Sea , with blades that sweep a circle more than 100 ft ( 30 m ) wider than the diameter of the London landmark .
Lead engineer Bill Grainger thinks future turbines will be even bigger , saying : " There is n't a technical issue that screams out size limit . "
Offshore turbines are commonly capable of generating either 2.5 or five megawatts of power , but the Britannia will produce 10 megawatts .
That translates into enough electricity to power about 10,000 homes , and replace some two million barrels of oil during its lifetime .
Risk of failure
Mr Grainger thinks Britannia is only the start of a trend towards a new generation of giant turbines , producing more power , more cost - effectively .
He told The Engineer magazine : " There might be a limit to the size that people want to put into the field ; if a 20 megawatt turbine failed , that 's a big chunk of electricity to lose .
" But then , if a power station goes off - line you 've lost 300 megawatts , so I do n't think that 's a limit either .
You have to make changes as you get bigger .
Blades get floppier , for example Bill Grainger , Clipper Windpower Marine
" They 'll get bigger than 10 megawatts , is my feeling .
How much bigger ?
I do n't know . "
Mr Grainger is engineering manager at Clipper Windpower Marine , the UK arm of the US company in charge of the £ 44 m Britannia build .
Each of its blades will be 236ft ( 72 m ) long and will weigh more than 30 tonnes .
It is the enormous stress placed on these metal structures as they rotate that presents one of the biggest engineering challenges to increased turbine size .
Mr Grainger said : " You have to make changes as you get bigger .
" Blades get floppier , for example , so you have to put more carbon in , but we are n't anywhere near 100 % carbon yet . "
Britannia is being built at Blyth , in Northumberland , and is most likely to be placed on Dogger Bank , off the north - east coast of England .
An Interview with Belinda Wright , Founder & Executive Director of the Wildlife Protection Society of India ( www.wpsi-india.org)
Over the past 100 years wild tiger numbers have declined 97 % worldwide .
In India , where there are 39 tiger reserves and 663 protected areas , there may be only 1,400 wild tigers left , according to a 2008 census , and possibly as few as 800 , according to estimates by some experts .
Illegal poaching remains the primary cause of the tiger ’s decline , driven by black market demand for tiger skins , bones and organs .
For example , so far in May , four big cats have died in the Corbett Tiger Reserve alone due to poaching and poisoning .
This precipitous fall in tiger populations in India has lead the government to take crucial if not radical steps to prevent the Bengal Tiger from going extinct .
Not only are poaching , illegal logging , and habitat loss now being addressed , but the mushrooming tourism trade in and around tiger reserves will most likely be curtailed in the near future , as well .

One of India ’s leading conservationists , Belinda Wright has been on the forefront of the country ’s wildlife issues for over three decades .
While her organization , the Wildlife Protection Society of India ( WPSI ) , does not carry the global recognition of large international NGOs , her group ’s commitment to the preservation of tigers , their habitat , and the Indian people who live with these apex predators , is one reason tigers still exist .
In May 2010 , Wright spoke with mongabay.com about her in - the - trenches effort to protect tigers and India ’s endangered wildlife populations .
AN INTERVIEW WITH BELINDA WRIGHT
Mongabay : Your family has a long and distinguished history in humanitarian and conservation efforts in India .
What made you decide that wildlife , and tigers especially , are your calling ?

Belinda Wright :
Both my parents were wildlife enthusiasts .
I spent much of my childhood in the jungles of eastern India , in tiger habitat in fact , and I guess it was in my blood .
I never wanted to do anything else and I remember , at the age of 14 , announcing this to my family .
A few years later I ventured out as a wildlife photographer – a rare creature in those days – and later became a wildlife documentary film maker .
I worked for many years , both as a still photographer and a filmmaker , for National Geographic .
Then in 1994 , I made the decision to become a full - time wildlife activist and put away my cameras .
I guess it was pay - back time , for all that wildlife had given me .
I have now been working on wildlife issues in India for over 35 years .
Umbrella species like the tiger and Asian elephant are under tremendous pressure from poaching , habitat loss , and human population growth .
How does WPSI ’s work address these issues ?
Which programs are you seeing making the biggest impact ?
WPSI has been working tirelessly for more than 15 years to tackle India ’s growing wildlife crisis by providing support and information to government authorities to combat poaching and illegal wildlife trade ; by dealing with human - animal conflicts ; and by providing support to conservation field projects .

Our Anti-Poaching and Illegal Wildife Trade program has been particularly successful .
A countrywide network of WPSI field investigators provides a constant flow of information that is processed and used to assist enforcement authorities in the arrest of hundreds of wildlife criminals throughout India , and the seizure of wildlife products , particularly tiger parts .
WPSI also maintains a Wildlife Crime Database which has records of more than 16,500 wildlife cases , along with details of over 12,900 alleged wildlife criminals .
It is continuously updated and plays a critical role in exposing the extent of poaching and trade in India .
It also plays an important part in the development of new conservation strategies .
We also conduct Wildlife Law Enforcement Workshops .
So far , we have hosted nearly 190 workshops and provided training to more than 7,800 forest and police officers in 17 states across India .
We have given specialist presentations to institutions such as the National Police Academy , the Indian Institute of Criminology , the Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) , the Indo - Tibetan Border Police ( ITBP ) , Customs and Excise , the Wildlife Institute of India , and various enforcement training centers .

WPSI ’s Legal Program aims at strengthening wildlife laws and their implementation through research and advocacy .
At the policy level , WPSI engages and interacts with Government ministries and departments , and at the ground level we support the prosecution of poaching and trade cases that involve the tiger and other endangered species .
We also file petitions on important wildlife conservation issues , including encroachments in protected areas .
Apart from curbing wildlife crime , our other priority areas include critical issues such as the growing human - animal conflict ( which in turn fuels poaching ) , and awareness generation .
We support conservation projects on subjects as varied as elephant corridors , tiger census techniques and a campaign to save the olive ridley sea turtle off the coast of Orissa .
One such high - impact project is our “ Corridor to Survival ” landscape plan for elephants in the states of Jharkhand and Orissa , in eastern India .
An action plan for elephant conservation has been drawn up by WPSI which is currently being implemented by the Orissa State Government .
WPSI has site - specific projects in and around six Tiger Reserves – Sundarban , Ranthambhore , Bandhavgarh , Tadoba , Corbett and Satkosia Gorge .
Mongabay : I have been asked before how can one worry about wildlife and donate to conservation with so many humanitarian crises taking place .
I respond by pointing out that it is n’t the animals that receive the money – it ’s the people who live with them .
Do you see WPSI ’s role as not only conservation driven , but humanitarian driven as well ?
Belinda Wright :
Although WPSI ’s main activities are targeted towards wildlife , we believe that there is a vital link with humanitarian issues .
In our experience , for conservation efforts to succeed local people need to become stakeholders , economically and emotionally .

Our on - ground projects reflect this .
We always hire local staff , and endeavor to create income - generating activities among the local communities to reduce pressure on the forests and wildlife .
Through our Community Outreach Program in the Sundarbans , for instance , we have supported the development of a range of livelihood activities to help reduce people ’s dependency on the forests .
WPSI has supported a micro credit scheme for over 50 self - help groups of women in the Sundarbans .
These women are now earning incomes for their families by running mangrove plantation nurseries , and also by embroidering tigers and other animals onto silk , which are made into cushions for sale in the cities .
WPSI also provides healthcare and education facilities to the local people , to help them become more aware of the benefits and responsibilities towards their forests and wildlife .
Over the years , this has helped reduce the animosity against wildlife and man-animal conflict in the area .
Mongabay :
What has been the overall effect on these local communities where this conservation / humanitarian work is being done ?

Belinda Wright :
It is really heartening to see that where we have been able to effectively combine conservation and humanitarian activities , the local communities have started to view their wildlife as an asset rather than as a threat .
The understanding that they cannot survive without their forests is palpable , and some people have even begun to undertake their own conservation activities .
In the Sundarbans , over 180,000 mangrove saplings have been planted in and around Bali Island by the local communities .
With our support , the locals have also formed a voluntary Tiger Rescue Team which reacts swiftly to any reports of tigers entering nearby villages .
Armed with nets , sticks and portable loudspeakers , they assist in keeping crowds away from a tiger until the Forest Department arrives on the scene .
This has helped save many tigers from a violent and unnecessary death .
Chinese demand for tiger parts has been the tiger ’s nemesis for many decades now .
WPSI works closely with the Indian government to curtail poaching and trade in illegal wildlife , but each year goes by and wildlife numbers continue to fall .
What do you see is necessary for a real break through – a systematic end of poaching as we know it ?

One of India ’s biggest challenges , particularly to safeguard wild tigers , is the enforcement of our wildlife laws .
Although we have good wildlife laws and policies , they are not implemented effectively .
Enforcement has also not moved with the times .
What we need now is professional , intelligence - led enforcement .
Without this we cannot hope to stop the poaching mafias that empty our forests often with impunity , and the well - organized traders and smugglers that control the trade in tiger and other wildlife parts across international borders .
India has been trying to dialogue with China , where the lucrative and huge demand for tiger parts is fueled .
Until this has been achieved , and China agrees to keep its 1983 ban on the use of tiger bone in traditional Chinese medicine in place and seriously crack down on the trade in tiger parts , the best thing India can do is to focus on keeping our wild tigers alive .
The effective implementation of our wildlife laws , to stop poaching of tigers and their prey species , will go a long way to achieving this .
We must also deal with three other critical issues of habitat loss , man-animal conflict , and good leadership in the field .
There is now a lot more awareness of these problems and the Indian Government is providing the funds and taking big steps to address these issues .
Mongabay : Given the downturn in the global economy , have you seen any variations in poaching numbers this past year ?
Belinda Wright :
The number of tiger poaching cases does not seem to be effected by the downturn in the global economy .
In fact , 2010 is the ‘ Year of the Tiger ’ in China , and poaching cases are predicted to be higher than usual to feed the demand for tiger parts .
In 2009 , WPSI recorded 85 cases of tiger mortality , which included 32 poaching and seizure cases ( 38 % ) .
So far in 2010 , we have already lost 23 wild tigers , including 15 tigers to poaching .
Mongabay : Aside from tigers , how are other indicator species like the Great Indian One - horned Rhinoceros doing ?

Belinda Wright :
Although the Great Indian One - horned Rhinoceros made a spectacular comeback in the 1900s , it is now facing two serious threats , that of poaching and loss of habitat to encroachments .
Rhino horns are highly valued in the illegal wildlife trade .
They are also known to help fund the activities of insurgents , including the purchase of arms , in north - east India .
Kaziranga National Park , which is only 430 sq km , is home to about 2,048 Indian rhinos ( 68 % of the world ’s population ) .
Not a week goes by when the brave forest guards of Kaziranga have a shoot out with poachers .
Even the army has been called in to help with the battle against poachers .
At least nine rhinos have been killed by poachers in Kaziranga in the first five months of 2010 .
Mongabay :
No doubt you had many encounters with tigers during the making of your Emmy Award - winning National Geographic film “ Land of the Tiger . ”
Is there any one particular “ tiger moment ” that moves you even today ?
Belinda Wright :
I have two “ tiger moments ” that are deeply etched in my memory ; even now they continue to inspire me to fight on to secure a future for wild tigers .
The first , was one afternoon in Kanha National Park in 1982 .
I was sitting on the back of an elephant watching a tigress we called ‘ Banseri ’ in a bamboo forest .
Banseri moved towards a clearing ablaze with shafts of golden light .
She laid down , lifted her head and made a gentle call .
Two young cubs padded out of the bamboo , greeted her affectionately and startled suckling .
This is the first time I had ever seen this and I have never felt more privileged .

The second moment was early one morning in Ranthambhore , also in 1982 , when I was sitting quietly in a stripped - down Jeep watching a tigress we knew well called ‘ Lakshmi ’ .
She was in a rocky stream - bed and had just killed a cheetal stag .
After a while , Lakshmi looked up at us and with considerable difficulty lifted the dead cheetal and carried it determinedly towards our parked Jeep .
She stuffed her prize virtually under the vehicle and looked at us as if to say ‘ please look after this for me ’ .
She then walked to a nearby pool to drink and cool off .
Fifteen minutes later Lakshmi returned , pulled the stag out , and proceeded to eat it beside us .
If was an incredible example of trust by a wild carnivore .
Mongabay :
What is your current estimation of the wild tiger population and if things improve , where do you think this number could be in 5 or 10 years ?

Belinda Wright :
I believe the last all - India tiger estimation , which gave a lower limit of 1,165 tigers and an upper limit of 1,657 ( this did not include tigers in Sundarban , Jharkand and parts of Chhattisgarh ) , was as accurate as possible .
These depressing figures were released in 2008 , after two years of research .
Tiger poaching and mortality figures have certainly not decreased since then and unfortunately it is likely that the new estimation will show a further decline in tiger numbers .
The results of the study are due to be released in October 2010 .
But all hope is not lost for the tiger .
Tigers are resilient , and good breeders .
If we can secure their protection , good prey densities and inviolate space for these incredible big cats , India can certainly sustain a much larger tiger population .
Mongabay :
What can the general public outside of India do to get involved with tiger conservation ?
Belinda Wright :
The most effective thing that people outside India can do is to speak out about wild tigers , and show that they care about their survival .
India , and the other 14 tiger range countries , need to know that this is a critical issue and that the eyes of the world are watching them .
China , in particular , needs to understand that saving wild tigers is an important global issue and that it is imperative that China takes five urgent steps : ( i ) publicly declare that the 1993 ban on the use of tiger bones for traditional Chinese medicine is permanent , ( ii ) destroy all its stockpiles of tiger parts , as India has done , ( iii ) phase out tiger farms , ( iv ) send a strong message to consumers that the use of skins and other tiger parts will not be tolerated , and ( v ) enforce the law .

People outside India need to keep themselves informed of the issues surrounding the plight of the tiger .
They can do this by following stories in the media , and on the internet , and by following current conservation efforts .
The website truthabouttigers.org and WPSI ’s website www.wpsi-india.org are two such informative websites .
People outside India should also keep their governments and public aware of the issues by writing letters to political leaders , newspaper editors , etc .
Another way of helping is to donate funds for tiger conservation efforts in India , or start a fund raising campaign in your school , work environment , or community .
You do not have to be in India to be a part of the tiger conservation movement .
Everyone has a skill to offer , either in person or through the Internet , that can contribute to the cause ; journalists can spread awareness , people with IT skills can assist with websites , politicians can make sure that the issue is kept alive politically , and others in civil society can raise funds and awareness .
It is essential that we all work together to save what is undoubtedly the most charismatic animal on this planet .
If we fail , the world will be a much , much poorer place , and indeed future generations will condemn us for letting this glorious animal , the tiger , slip through our fingers .

Why top predators matter : an in - depth look at new research
( 02/02/2010 )
Few species have faced such vitriolic hatred from humans as the world ’s top predators .
Considered by many as pests — often as dangerous — they have been gunned down , poisoned , speared , ‘ finned ’ , and decimated across their habitats .
Even where large areas of habitat are protected , the one thing that is often missing are top predators .
However , new research over the past few decades is showing just how vital these predators are to ecosystems .
Biologists have long known that predators control populations of prey animals , but new studies show that they may do much more .
From controlling smaller predators to protecting river banks from erosion to providing nutrient hotspots , it appears that top predators are indispensible to a working ecosystem .
Top predators sit at the apex of an ecosystem ’s food chain .
Wolves in Alaska , tigers in Siberia , lions in Kenya , white sharks in the Pacific are all examples of top predators .

Today 's WikiWeirdness is that connoisseur of celery , grocery bags and panties counter - gravitationally tumbling around the ankles of shocked 50's pin-up models ... the notorious Art Frahm .
From the Wikipedia article :
Art Frahm ( 1907 - 1981 ) was an American painter of campy pin-up girls and advertising .
Frahm lived in Chicago , and was active from the 1940s to 1960s .
Today he is best known for his “ ladies in distress ” pictures involving beautiful young women whose panties mysteriously flutter to the ground in public situations , often causing them to spill their bag of groceries .
In one of Frahm ’s noted idiosyncratic touches , celery is often depicted .
Of course , here 's something that I never hear anyone mention about Frahm : the bag of groceries is an excuse for the girl to have her hands full , and be completely incapable of pulling up her panties as they fall .
Plausible .
Genius .
Art Frahm is , without a doubt , my favorite painter .
I have printed out a number of the illustrations from his ' Ladies in Distress ' series , had them tastefully framed and hanged them all over my bathroom walls .
Coupled with the mirror that points directly at the toilet , this has caused a good deal of consternation amongst some of my female visitors when they 've had to use the toilet , but it 's all in the sake of art .
Of course , the Wikipedia entry on Art is pretty swell , but James Lileks ' series of Frahmian analysis is still quintessential .
Art Frahm [ Wikipedia ]
We may ask why the US sends troops abroad , but the fact is that we do send large numbers into a region about which they have little knowledge and almost no cultural connection .
We then ask them to interact safely and efficiently with military and civilian natives .
These interactions require varying levels of linguistic , cultural , and interpersonal background .
As a foreign language educator , I am fascinated by the evolution of the training materials given to US soldiers and how cultural visual knowledge plays and increasingly important role .
Over the past seven years , the military has noticeably changed how it trains soldiers for these vital kinds of cross-cultural interactions .
These " changes in visuality " allow an exemplary look at how visual & cultural literacy has seriously impacted language and cultural training .
The first way instructors train is to rely on a simple visual clue for meaning .
This is the equivalent of simple translations .
The approach image = word = meaning is effective when it comes to teaching soldiers basic life saving skills in the field while trying to increase their visual perception performance .
In the case of IED recognition , nuance is not necessary and soldiers react quickly , based on what they see , to avoid this threat .
Images of various IED types are presented for soldiers to study with the basic word association of IED = Death .
The training materials also feature severed limbs to show the result of these attacks .
In highlighting cases like these we need to keep in mind the importance of the elementary nature of this survival training .
Important vocabulary items were usually handed out on so called " smart cards " or laminated sheets for people to study with a limited amount of material on them .
An almost complete reliance on visuals proved to be somewhat effective in the arena of threat recognition .
When soldiers face the danger of improvised explosive devices , they need to visually recognize the object immediately .
Additionally , they need to quickly identify their target in conditions that may not be optimal .
Soldiers are increasingly using technology - mediated visual equipment , for example night vision , and must quickly make decisions based on visual clues alone .
Beyond the mere threat recognition strategies associated with visual training of soldiers , a problem with ' enhanced ' visual perception devices is the avoidance of fratricide as indicated in this 2008 study .
In the Iraqi and Afghani combat zones , however , the initial war was a precursor to the real war , that of the insurgency .
The initial fighting gave way to an occupation involving an insurgency coupled with a civilian population that may or may not be hostile .
Soldiers were not only expected to make decisions regarding friend or foe , they were expected to engage locals in close quarters with both weapons and words .
The military also relied heavily on these visual training modules to equip their soldiers with linguistic and cultural knowledge .
The classic military phrase book method puts the locals in a clear adversarial position .
All the phrases introduced center around providing security for the soldiers and keeping them alive .
From that starting point , basic cultural knowledge is introduced including local customs , expressions , and items that one might encounter in the field .
Here we see the progressions of two separate training cards for soldiers at two different stages .
The second card moves towards authentic photos to instruct the soldiers in basic culture in Iraq , as the stick figure drawings were not providing enough useful information .
Cultural training materials developed from mere tools of threat recognition to models of threat prevention .
The method of threat prevention is based on understanding the authentic culture of the area in order to engage the locals in a meaningful way .
At Fort Irwin , California , at the National Training Center , the military has constructed Iraqi villages in the desert so soldiers can practice their interactions with locals and insurgents and get the authentic feel for life in Iraq as an occupying force .
The documentary film Full Battle Rattle ( 2008 ) chronicles soldiers ' experiences in this virtual arena where they are expected to engage people through culture and language , not merely through the force of their weapons .
This shift in approach has proven to be effective .
Cultural training programs are ongoing and exist for several areas .
Cross-cultural competence is " something that we want to bring to the department as a critical piece of training that we think needs to be incorporated into our overall training establishment , " said Gail H. McGinn , the deputy undersecretary of defense for plans , during an interview with Pentagon Channel and American Forces Press Service reporters .
This cultural training program has now gone electronic through the program " Tactical Language Series , " a type of virtual reality gaming environment designed to teach people visual literacy and cultural knowledge for the geographical and linguistic areas in which they will serve .
The company that developed the Tactical Language series , Alelo , Inc , states on their web site :
DARPA The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Program Manager Dr. Ralph Chatham was inspired to start the program after listening to one of the first soldiers who went into Afghanistan in 2002 .
The captain told how he and his comrades reluctantly rode on tiny ponies into a town , totally relying on their Northern Alliance escorts who only spoke Pashto and some broken Russian and Arabic while the U.S. soldiers only spoke English and some broken Russian and Arabic .
When the town 's people came out on the streets the soldiers did not know if they were friendly or hostile from their gestures , demeanor and words .
The Tactical Language Series currently has virtual worlds for military personal to learn Iraqi Arabic , Pashto , Dari , and French for North Africa .
Here you see examples from the " Tactical Iraqi " October 2009 release .
These programs use a hybrid approach to training that employs authentic visuals and mission - based skills .
Most importantly , though , cultural competence is taught through virtual engagement with locals .
The program teaches soldiers to recognize military insignias of foreign militaries through virtual reality games designed to enhance their visual perception .
Most of the training here takes places at a cognitive visual level , so that recall time is enhanced .
Soldiers take commands in the local dialect and navigate virtual authentic cities and villages .
They learn local customs , gestures , and cultural practices that are meant to help them interact with locals in order to avoid cultural misunderstandings .
This training software resembles the typical first person shooter game many soldiers are familiar with .
Unlike a first person shooter game , though , this series does not have the option to pull a gun .
In place of weapons one finds culturally - appropriate gestures and an accurate voice recognition system , which allows the learner to interact with virtual Iraqis in Arabic .
The development , implementation , and continued use of this intercultural training approach poses several questions .
What does this teach us about how we learn languages and interact with other cultures ?
In a short period of time ( from an educational - curricular perspective ) the military has gone from the old " Hands - up ! " phrase book to a complete realization that culture is intrinsically tied to language and that phrases are not enough to engage people .
In order to communicate , you must know something about a person .
While it may not be a magic bullet for intercultural training , the fundamental design aspects of this educational training tool focus on cultural proficiency and use of the language in an authentic , respectful context .
From the Computer Assisted Language Learning ( CALL ) perspective , this training program highlights the fact that images , specifically culturally authentic images are required in this training .
When you train absolute beginners , authentic images tie the language to a culturally specific context for use .
For too long we have used generic stock photos , clip art , and line drawings for visual clues in multi-media learning environments .
Since the greatest source of these images in the US , most of the world 's computer based language programs reflect a world view ( literally ) that shows homes as always having a two car garage , white picket fences , grocery store baggers , and upper middle class citizens .
You could say that clip art and stock photos are not representative of any culture .
Nevertheless , they remain popular in popular language learning software packages .
In the educational world , we talk of assessment to prove educational effectiveness .
In the world of the U.S. Military , assessment of cultural training can be a life and death matter .
Therefore it is an interesting example from which we can learn a great deal .
Alelo , Inc is developing software for the US Military that is , educationally speaking , pretty advanced and quite effective for elementary learners with little experience in language acquisition .
The necessity of that training aside , it is fascinating to see a US military training program that sets out as its premise the need for threat avoidance through cultural understanding and linguistic proficiency .
If one looks at the suggested pre-deployment reading list , one will find a great deal about the culture of the area , a shift from the previous approach of phrases and limited cultural information .
Since NATO forces will adopt some of these technologies in the near future , specifically the UK and German forces , it is also fascinating to see the US take the lead on language learning .
What is the word for someone who speaks three languages ?
" Trilingual "
And the word for a speaker of two languages ?
" Bilingual "
And for one language ?
" American "
Perhaps the old joke may not be true anymore .
While the lessons of war are often lost on current and future generations of citizens , soldiers , and leaders , I 'm hopeful that this method of using authentic media in an effective & prudent manner will be one to reach language educators at all levels of instruction .
The media is out there , so let 's use it in a better way .
Venus , currently one of the most inhospitable places in thesolar system , may once have had an ample supply of water ?
possibly even oceans ?
and been a potentially habitable place when it was young , a new studysuggests .
The finding comes from the European Space Agency ( ESA ) 's VenusExpress satellite currently orbiting our neighboring planet .
The probe isproviding new evidence that Venus and Earth are n't as dissimilar as they seem .
Earth and Venus are wildly different today .
Earth is teemingwith life at clement temperatures , while Venusis hellish , its surface hotter than the inside of a kitchen oven .
But the two planets share some striking similarities .
Theyare nearly identical in size and makeup , for example .
" The basic composition of Venusand Earth is very similar , " said H?kan Svedhem , ESA project scientistfor Venus Express .
Today , Venus has very little water .
If the amount of watervapor in the atmosphereof Venus was spread onto the planet 's surface , it would create a globalpuddle just 1.2 inches ( 3 cm ) deep .
By comparison , Earth 's oceans would createa layer 1.9 miles ( 3 km ) deep if they were spread evenly across our planet .
Yet scientists think this was n't always the case on Venus .
Billionsof years ago , the planet may have had much more water , they said .
Over time , Venus is thought to have lost a large quantity ofthat water to space .
As ultraviolet radiation from the sun streams into theplanet 's atmosphere it breaks up the water molecules into their constituenthydrogen and oxygen atoms .
Then these loose atoms escape into space .
Venus Express has measured this escaping water vapor , andfound that about twice as much hydrogen as oxygen is escaping , ESA officialssaid in an announcement .
Since water is made of two hydrogen atoms and oneoxygen atom , the findings suggest that water is the source of this escaping material .
" Everything points to there being large amounts ofwater on Venus in the past , " said research team member Colin Wilson of Oxford University in England .
But that does not necessarily mean there were vast oceans onVenus , researchers cautioned .
The water could have been mostly locked in the atmosphere ofVenus and existed only during the very earliest times , when the surface of theplanet was completely molten , according to computer models by researcher EricChassefi?re of France 's Universit ?
Paris -Sud .
However , colliding comets may have delivered additionalwater to the surface of Venus that could have crated standing bodies of water , the researchers said .
If Venus ever did possess surface water , the planet may havehad an early habitable phase during which life may have been able to form .
" Much more extensive modeling of the magmaocean ?
atmosphere system and of its evolution is required to better understandthe evolution of the young Venus , " Chassefi ?re said .
The Venus Express team discussed some of their findings at the International Venus Conference this week in Aussois , France .
It 's a last - ditch effort to alter / thwart Democratic financial reforms : House Republicans will force a floor vote today on Ron Paul 's proposal for an audit of the Federal Reserve .
The effort is tied to America Speaking Out , the House GOP legislative crowd - sourcing website in which Republicans take suggestions from users on bills to propose .
According to the House GOP , a fed audit is one of the suggestions most commonly offered through the website .
Paul introduced the Federal Reserve Transparency
Act last spring ; it would require the Government Accountability Office to conduct and audit and submit the results to Congress .
The proposal is popular in the House , having gained 320 cosponsors , but probably would n't fare as well in the Senate : a related bill , introduced by Vermont Independent Sen.
Bernie Sanders , drew only two cosponsors .
The vote will come in the form of a Motion to Recommit , a parliamentary procedure that allows the minority party one last chance to alter a bill and send it back to committee before it is passed .
Given how close Democrats are to passing financial reform , it 's unlikely House Dems -- even those who want to see a GAO audit of the Fed - - will vote to send House and Senate negotiators back to the negotiating table .
The financial reform bill already has a compromise Fed - audit provision ; the motion to recommit would replace it with Paul 's language .
One intriguing political dimension of this is that Paul has somehow found himself , to some degree , in the mainstream : his skepticism of the Fed has gained traction not just among Tea Partiers , but among a majority of the House , including liberals , moderates , and Bush - era conservatives .
Lynn Woolsey , who chairs the House Progressive Caucus , supports his bill ; so does House Minority Leader John Boehner .
House Republican leaders are pushing Paul 's idea to combat the Democratic platform .
I do n't think we 'll see Paul taking over as Minority Leader or Speaker next year , but it 's tempting to call it a sign of the times that popular legislation by the libertarian outsider is being pushed by his party 's establishment .

A string of delays and extension periods written into a final version of Congress 's financial regulation reform bill means that firms such as Citigroup and Goldman Sachs could exploit loopholes until 2022 before withdrawing from " illiquid " funds such as private equity .
The long gestation period is an example of the degree of compromise inserted into the package following months of lobbying on Capitol Hill by powerful banks .
" You ca n't just say ' stop ' , you ca n't just say ' unwind , ' " said Lawrence Kaplan , a lawyer at Paul , Hastings , Janofsky & Walker in Washington , who said the delay was a dose of political reality .
" These things have contracts and detailed legal frameworks .
You ca n't undo them without doing considerable harm . "
The Volcker rule , championed by formed Federal Reserve boss Paul Volcker , stops banks from engaging in " proprietary trading " whereby they trade with their own capital , rather than clients ' money .
It also severely restricts their investments in high - risk hedge funds and private equity ventures .
Language in the act , according to Bloomberg News , allows for a six - month study and a further nine months of rule - making .
The measure is supposed to become effective 12 months after the final rule is laid , then banks have two years to conform .
But if they need to , they can apply for a three - year extension .
On top of that , a five - year moratorium is available for " illiquid " funds that are hard to unwind .
Complicated caveats in the bill are subject to interpretation .
A spokesman for Jeff Merkley , a Democrat who proposed various changes to the rule , told Bloomberg that the maximum delay was supposed to be nine years .
Other measures in Obama 's reforms include the creation of a consumer protection agency , the introduction of a vote by shareholders ' on boardroom pay and new powers for authorities to seize troubled financial institutions .
For Wall Street , the Volcker rule and curbs on derivatives trading are the most contentious changes .
In a research note , analyst Jason Goldberg of Barclays Capital said JP Morgan , Bank of America and Citigroup would be most affected by a ban on proprietary trading .
Taken together with the rest of the regulatory reform bill , Goldberg estimated that Obama 's crackdown could cut earnings at 26 leading banks by 14 % in 2013 , eliminating nearly $ 18bn of profit .
WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama urged Congress Tuesday to pass legislation that would create a $ 30 billion fund to incite banks to extend credit to small businesses .
Mr. Obama outlined the proposal in February and it is part of a broad effort by the administration to spur small - business growth amid a lending slowdown caused by the economic downturn .
Such efforts include several tax breaks and changes to Small Business Administration lending programs .

A movie director in India is threatening legal action against lawmakers after it was revealed they gathered and watched a pirate copy of his hit movie .
The film , titled ' Raajneeti ' ( ' Politics ' ) , was released early this month in theaters but dozens of lawmakers from the Indian Bharatiya Janata Party did n't visit one .
They were caught after their illicit screening was broadcast on TV as part of a news report .
June started exceptionally well for movie director Prakash Jha .
His latest movie ‘ Raajneeti ‘ , which translates to ‘ Politics ’ , is a Bollywood political thriller which has been doing rather well .
Inside two weeks the movie became an official hit taking around 1 billion rupees .
By the middle of the month , however , controversy came calling .
On June 15 the movie was screened at a plush hotel for the pleasure of dozens of legislators from the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) .
But there was a problem .
The movie is not officially available on DVD as it is still running in theaters .
The BJP overcame this small problem by watching a pirate copy .
The problematic viewing might have gone unnoticed if the country ’s news channels had n’t aired footage of the screening and one BJP member saying : “ We are watching this movie because it has the title Raajneeti [ Politics ] , it is the latest movie in town and more so because it has to do with politics . ”
A furious Prakash Jha immediately announced he would take action against both the politicians and the hotel where the screening took place .
“ Whatever legal recourse needs to be taken against people who were responsible for showing the film , and those who watched it , is being taken , ” said Jha .
“ No one will be spared , everybody involved – whether it is [ Former chief minister of the state ] Vasundhra Raje or the hotel authorities – will be punished . ”
“ It ’s funny to see that the first among lawmakers themselves are turning against the law , ” he added .
“ It ’s ridiculous that they screened a pirated version of the movie !
How can they not know that the original version of a just - released movie will never be available in the market ? ”
A BJP member was unapologetic .
“ They are making a mountain out of a molehill .
This is not good .
You talk to Prakash Jha as to what action he will take .
We have not done anything wrong . ”
Jha said that if the lawmakers wanted to watch the movie , if only they had asked he would ’ve provided a copy .
“ It ’s high time that a lesson be taught to people committing such illegal actions , ” he concludes .
“ We have been trying so hard all these years to fight piracy and they just come , watch a pirated movie and go .
Not done ! ”
Following the filing of a criminal complaint , last Thursday a court asked police to begin an investigation into the matter .
California welfare recipients are able to use state - issued debit cards to withdraw cash on gaming floors in more than half of the casinos in the state , a Los Angeles Times review of records found .
The cards , provided by the Department of Social Services to help recipients feed and clothe their families , work in automated teller machines at 32 of 58 tribal casinos and 47 of 90 state - licensed poker rooms , the review found .
State officials said Wednesday they were working to determine how much money had been withdrawn from casino ATMs by people using the welfare debit cards .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , who learned of the issue when asked to comment for this story , promised to take immediate action .

“ We have instructed our vendors to prohibit these cards from being accepted at ATMs located in casinos and card rooms , ” Schwarzenegger spokesman Aaron McLear said Wednesday .
“ It is reprehensible that anyone would use taxpayer money for anything other than its intended purpose . ”
Administration officials said the social services agency contracts with a private ATM network to handle the electronic transfer of benefits to people on welfare , and had n’t noticed that the taxpayer money was being withdrawn at gambling establishments .
McLear said the system of paying out welfare benefits via bank cards was created under Schwarzenegger ’s predecessor , Democrat Gray Davis .
Since the late 1990s most states have adopted this system , which is a viewed as a more efficient way of distributing and tracking government aid .

Schwarzenegger has been wrangling with lawmakers over other efforts to combat waste and fraud in the state ’s social services programs .
He fought back a legislative effort to discontinue fingerprinting of food stamp recipients , a system designed to prevent double - dipping and other abuses .
Casino ATMs account for a handful of the thousands of machines in the contractor ’s network , and the amount withdrawn from them by welfare recipients almost certainly would comprise a tiny fraction of the state ’s multibillion - dollar welfare spending .
But the issue is likely to come up as lawmakers fight over how best to close their historic budget deficit .
Schwarzenegger had already threatened to eliminate the state welfare program in his May budget proposal , and that was before he and his Republican allies in the Legislature knew that the cash could be accessed by people strolling from poker games to blackjack tables .
“ In a time when we have a $ 19 - billion deficit , and we ’re taking a serious look at the future of many safety - net programs , it ’s appalling to think that welfare beneficiaries can use their cards in a casino , ” said Seth Unger , spokesman for the Assembly Republican Caucus .

Democratic leaders , who have vowed to protect the state ’s fraying social safety net , also began calling for reform Wednesday .
“ In these tough times , when so many children and vulnerable families depend on the safety net , we have to make sure food stamps and other services are being used the way the people of California intended them to be , ” said Shannon Murphy , spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker John A. Perez ( D - Los Angeles ) .
“ Other states have closed this loophole , and the Assembly will work with the Schwarzenegger administration to make that happen . ”
The casinos are listed on a Department of Social Services website that allows welfare recipients to search for addresses of ATMs where they can withdraw cash provided under the Temporary Aid for Needy Families program .
The monthly grant ranges up to $ 694 ; most of the ATMs impose a withdrawal limit of about $ 300 per day .
The Times compared the addresses on that website with lists of tribal casinos and state - licensed poker rooms published on the California Gambling Control Commission ’s website .

It ’s not clear which casinos are most frequently patronized by welfare recipients because social services officials denied a January request from The Times for data showing transaction information from all of the ATMs in their network .
Department lawyers argued that federal law prohibits the state from releasing financial information about merchants who accept cards issued to welfare recipients .
The Electronic Benefit Transfer cards look and work just like ordinary debit cards .
They allow welfare recipients to access two accounts : the cash offered so needy parents can provide a home for their children while they train for better jobs , and an electronic version of food stamps that has restrictions on where and how the benefits can be spent .
The cash benefits , however , can be withdrawn and spent just about anywhere .
The Capitol Casino , a few blocks from the legislative chambers in Sacramento , appears on the social services website showing where clients can get money .
Each of its small rooms has an ATM : one so close to a poker table that a player could lean back and withdraw cash without leaving his chair ; the other is a few steps from the blackjack table .
Advertisement
At the Casino Royale on the outskirts of Sacramento , the first thing patrons pass as they walk to the gaming floor is the ATM with a sign next to it saying , “ Exceed your ATM daily limit here ! ! ”
Faye Stearns , a part - owner of Casino Royale , said she had no idea people on welfare could withdraw taxpayer dollars from the machine , and would not oppose a measure to prohibit it .
“ We would n’t want to be taking money from children , ” Stearns said .
“ The adults ?
Hey , that ’s their problem .
But kids ?
No . ”
The cash portion of California ’s welfare benefits comes from Temporary Assistance for Needy Families .
Each year , California ’s program gets $ 3.7 billion from the federal government and $ 2.9 billion from state and local governments .
Advertisement
The state of New Mexico and at least one company that supplies ATMs to the gaming industry have already taken steps to make sure their machines in casinos reject welfare cards .
“ It makes social sense , ” said John Monforte , executive director of the New Mexico Gaming Control Board .
“ There are wonderful things [ casinos ] do for tribal governments , but the reality is there are also negative social impacts . ”
Global Cash Access , a Las Vegas firm that provides ATMs and other equipment for more than 1,000 casinos in the United States , started programming their machines to reject welfare cards more than a decade ago .
“ Unless a state tells us to allow access to their EBT cards , we will continue to block these cards from being accepted at our devices , ” said Katie Lever , the firm ’s general counsel .
“ It ’s really easy to do . ”

How ’s All That Progressive Regulatory Stuff Workin’ Out For Ya ?
In a previous column ( “ BP ’s Fate in a Free Market , Part Two “ ) , I discussed the possible ways that unlimited tort liability might discipline corporate polluters and other malfeasors in a free market regime .
Total damages from a spill like Deepwater Horizon , if not enough to liquidate all the assets of a company like BP , would probably eat up enough of their ongoing revenue stream for many years to amount to a corporate death sentence .
The resulting market pressures to maintain robust liability insurance would be intense , and the economic incentives for insurers to impose effective safety regimes would be overwhelming .
But look at the other side of the scale .
How ’s the much - vaunted regulatory state actually been performing ?
BP management deliberately skimped on safety measures , neglected maintenance on multiple levels of failsafe mechanisms because they cut into profits , and slept ( and snorted crystal meth ) with government inspectors .
Now one could argue , and that quite plausibly , that this was a holdover from the Bush years , when Exxon - Mobil lobbyists wrote environmental policy on hunting trips with Dick Cheney .
But that does n’t explain the farce put on by Tony Hayward and Barack Obama since the spill happened .
While emoting in TV ads , saying all the right things about “ earning the public trust ” and “ making things right , ” what has Hayward actually been doing ?
From what I ’ve seen on CNN , the skimmers and cleanup crews actually assigned to controlling damage are a tiny fraction of the resources that could be brought to bear , if BP hired all the specialists and contract workers available for the job .
Instead , they ’ve spent what amounts to a few days ’ total profits .
BP brought in ringers to pad the cleanup effort a hundredfold for Obama ’s appearance , while warning their cleanup workers not to talk to the press .
BP told cleanup workers they did n’t need safety gear like masks and gloves — mainly because the sight of all those people in spacesuits would be really bad PR — and ( again ) warned them not to talk to the press .
BP has refused to share its inside knowledge of the chemical composition of its dispersants , which means the cleanup workers , public and ecosystem are subject to God only knows what kinds of risks .
The average age of cleanup workers from the Exxon - Valdez spill today is 51 , some talking head on CNN said today , and most of them are dead .
Despite all his superficially assuring promises to make good on all damages , on closer inspection Hayward shows himself to be as much a master of “ what is is ” as Bill Clinton .
Notice how he keeps inserting that “ all valid claims ” qualifier ?
That means , according to my crystal ball , that BP will fight every single claim to the highest available court of appeals , and will end up paying only the “ valid claims ” of those fishermen rich enough to afford a gazillion dollars in legal fees .
In short , while boohooing like Iron Eyes Cody in his tearjerker TV ads , Hayward is displaying exactly the same leadership style that created the mess in the first place : cutting corners , doing things on the cheap , stonewalling , shining it on and covering up .
And what is our “ progressive ” government doing about it ?
Hayward ’s not even getting the kind of grilling the Detroit CEOs got before Congress ( remember how they fidgeted about the corporate jets ? ) .
Let alone any tough talk about criminal prosecutions from the Justice Department .
Imagine the treatment you ’d get from the government if you owed them $ 1000 , and contrast that with the government ’s treatment of a man who was almost certainly criminally negligent in causing billions of dollars worth of damage .
Think : this is the most “ progressive ” president , with the largest Democratic majority , likely to be elected in a generation .
If this guy lacks the political will to make full use of the powers available to him in holding a dirtbag like Hayward accountable in a smoking gun case like this , what good ’s a regulatory state ?
A regulatory state that works properly only when completely staffed with Dudley Do-Rights , who never sleep on the job ( especially with the people they ’re supposed to be regulating ) is a regulatory state that will never work .
In the real world , government is a lot more apt to protect the corporations against you than vice versa .
Thursday on CNN , watch BP chief executive Tony Hayward testify before a congressional committee looking into the oil disaster .
You can see it for yourself on CNN , CNN.com / Live , and the CNN iPhone app starting at 10 a.m. ET Thursday .
Washington ( CNN ) --
Eight weeks after an explosion uncorked a massive oil spill into the Gulf , BP still does not know whether its efforts to stanch the flow will soon succeed , its CEO will testify Thursday .
" We cannot guarantee the outcome of these operations , but we are working around the clock with the best experts from government and industry , " Tony Hayward says in prepared testimony to be delivered before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations .
Hayward expresses regret over the disaster .
" The explosion and fire aboard the Deepwater Horizon and the resulting oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico never should have happened -- and I am deeply sorry that they did , " he says in his prepared remarks .
" None of us yet knows why it happened .
But whatever the cause , we at BP will do what we can to make certain that an incident like this does not happen again . "
Rep. Bart Stupak , D - Michigan , appeared underwhelmed at Hayward 's planned appearance before his committee .
CNNMoney.com : BP's Hayward to strike emotional tone
" Look , he 's a corporate guy , " Stupak said .
" At the end of the day , he 's going to put his best foot forward .
It 's not going to ring true with me or the American public .
And we 've got a mess on our hands , a disaster , a catastrophic disaster for our environment and those people who lost their lives .
He 's just going to say , ' I 'm sorry , it 's not going to happen again . '
It 's not good enough . "
Stupak : Lawmakers going to take Hayward 's ' hide off '
But Hayward plans to say more than that .
The drilling of two relief wells , " which we believe represents the ultimate solution to stopping the flow of oil and gas from the well , " has reached depths of 15,226 feet and 9,778 feet , respectively , he says , but they are not expected to be completed until August .
" We have spent nearly $ 1.5 billion so far , and we will not stop until the job is done , " he says .
Day 58 : The latest on the oil disaster
Though the company has accepted that it is the " responsible party , " Hayward adds a qualification : " It is important to understand that this ' responsible party ' designation is distinct from an assessment of legal liability for the actions that led to the spill , " he says .
So far , more than 400,000 barrels of oily water mix have been recovered , and the company has paid more than $ 90 million on the more than 56,000 claims that have been submitted , he says .
Additionally , about $ 16 million is expected to be paid this week to businesses , he says .
In all , 32 walk - in claims offices are open in Alabama , Florida , Louisiana and Mississippi .
Nearly 700 people have been assigned the task of handling claims , he says .
How the oil - disaster flow estimates have evolved
Hayward adds that , though the cause of the disaster remains unclear , his company 's investigation suggests that the accident was caused by the apparent failure of " a number of processes , systems and equipment . "
" Investigations into the causes of the incident are ongoing , and issues of liability will be sorted out separately when the facts are clear and all the evidence is available . "
The transcript of Hayward 's planned remarks was given to reporters hours after he and other BP executives told President Obama that the company will set aside $ 20 billion in an escrow account to compensate oil spill victims .
The fund " will not supersede individuals ' or states ' rights to present claims in court , " Obama said .
BP , he asserted , will remain liable for the environmental disaster in the Gulf .
BP Chairman Carl - Henric
Svanberg said that the board of the oil giant has decided not to pay any further dividends this year .
BP also has agreed to create a $ 100 million fund to compensate oil rig workers now unemployed as a result of closure of other deep - water rigs after the April 20 Deepwater Horizon explosion , Obama said .
After taking a beating in recent weeks , BP 's stock price closed Wednesday at 31.85 , up 1.43 percent for the day .
The Obama administration has tapped attorney Kenneth Feinberg to mediate the claims process .
Feinberg played the same role in compensation for the victims of the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
Anyone dissatisfied with Feinberg 's handling of their claim will be able to appeal to a three - person panel , then to the federal oil spill liability trust fund and then to court , said Carol Browner , the president 's point person on energy and climate change .
BP has also paid roughly $ 70 million to the U.S. Coast Guard for cleanup operations , wire transfer receipts showed .
Svanberg apologized to the American people for the disaster .
He said he hoped the company could earn back the trust of the American people , because " we care about the small people . "
A few hours later , he issued a statement apologizing for the remark .
" I spoke clumsily this afternoon , and for that , I am very sorry , " he said .
" What I was trying to say -- that BP understands how deeply this affects the lives of people who live along the Gulf and depend on it for their livelihood -- will best be conveyed not by any words but by the work we do to put things right for the families and businesses who 've been hurt .
Like President Obama , I believe we made some good progress toward that goal today . "
BP has been under intense political pressure to ensure that it can cover all costs related to the catastrophic oil spill , the largest in U.S. history and one that Obama described as an " unprecedented environmental disaster . "
i Report : Share your views , solutions on Gulf oil spill
BP has been siphoning oil from a containment cap placed atop the ruptured well .
The company said Wednesday that it has started collecting oil gushing into the Gulf through a second containment system attached to the ruptured well .
The new system is connected directly to the blowout preventer and carries oil up to a second ship , the Q4000 .
By the end of July , officials hope to be able to contain as many as 80,000 barrels of oil per day , said Coast Guard Adm .
Thad Allen .
By that time , he predicted , there will be only " minimal leakage " around the wellhead .
On Tuesday , government scientists increased their estimate of oil flowing into the Gulf by 50 percent -- to between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels per day .
That translates into 1.5 million gallons to 2.5 million gallons per day .
The government 's previous estimate , issued last week , was 20,000 to 40,000 barrels per day .
Obama said Wednesday that BP assured him that recovery efforts should capture up to 90 percent of the gushing oil in the coming days and weeks .
" That is still not good enough , " Obama said .
" We will continue to press BP and draw on our best minds and resources to capture the rest of the oil until the company finishes drilling a relief well later in the summer that is expected to stop the leak completely . "
The spill dwarfs the 11 million gallons that were dumped into Alaska 's Prince William Sound in 1989 when the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground , and oil in varying amounts and consistencies has hit the shores of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida .
The United States is in danger of losing its ability to monitor key climate variables from satellites , according to a new Government Accountability Office report .
The country 's Earth - observing satellite program has been underfunded for a decade , and the impact of the lack of funds is finally hitting home .
The GAO report found that capabilities originally slated for two new Earth - monitoring programs , NPOESS and GOES -R , run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Department of Defense have been cut and adequate plans to replace them do not exist .
Meanwhile , up until six months ago , NASA had 15 functional Earth - sensing satellites .
Two of them went down in the past year , and of the remaining 13 , 12 are past their design lifetimes .
Only seven may be functional by 2016 , said Waleed Abdalati , a longtime NASA satellite scientist now teaching at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Studies at the University of Colorado Boulder .
Taken together , American scientists will soon find themselves without the ability to monitor changes to key Earth systems at a time when such measurements could help determine the paths of the world 's energy and transportation systems .
" Can you imagine if we 've passed the apex of our Earth - observing capability right at a time when we realize that , ' Hey , we need to understand what 's going on ' ? " said Abdalati .
" We 're talking about less than half the capability in the coming five years than we 've had in the previous five years . "
While President Obama 's 2011 budget has gone partway to restoring money for Earth observations , a decade of neglect has left the nation 's agencies – the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , NASA and the US Geological Survey – without the resources they need to do the job .
Despite this , the agencies put together a consortium to come up with a coordinated strategy for Earth observations , the United States Group on Earth Observations .
The group readied a report on the state of the nation 's Earth - observation capabilities , but it 's been stuck in review for the past year .
The GAO 's very first recommendation is that this report be released to the public .
" We 've been told that it proposes continuing observations in 15 to 20 areas .
We 've been told that it does n't involve costs and schedules , " said GAO auditor David Powner , lead author of the GAO report .
" We think that what 's really important is that we need to get these initial findings and reports .
Everyone is telling us that there are good things to build off of in there . "
The National Academy of Sciences also created a survey of satellite capability , which highlighted 15 important missions .
The group of scientists called for increasing NASA 's $ 1.4 billion Earth - science budget by $ 500 million .
Without that cash infusion , American Earth - observation capabilities will decline .
" The extraordinary U.S. foundation of global observations is at great risk , " the report concludes .
" Between 2006 and the end of the decade , the number of operating missions will decrease dramatically , and the number of operating sensors and instruments on NASA spacecraft , most of which are well past their nominal lifetimes , will decrease by some 40 percent . "
Obama 's current budget plans have the NASA Earth - science budget reaching $ 1.65 billion by 2014 , but the damage to the base of the country 's capabilities during the Bush years continue to hurt current operations .
" It 's no secret that Earth science did suffer at NASA and perhaps at NOAA under the Bush administration , " Abdalati said .
" Now , there are certainly efforts to reclaim that capability . "
But American scientists are now playing from behind trying to replace or patch up the infrastructure that lets us understand what 's going on with our planet .
There are structural problems , too .
Climate observation missions have very particular requirements , said climate scientist Inez Fung of the University of California at Berkeley .
" If you want to do climate change , you need a uniform set of data so that you can compare changes through time , " Fung said .
" It 's a really tough problem . "
That means researchers need continuity in the data they receive from satellites , which requires long - term planning and long - term planning requires consistent funding .
" Long - term planning for the federal government is really difficult , " Powner said .
" There are some good folks within NOAA , NASA and DOD who are very concerned about the long - term outlook .
But it 's tough to compete , especially when there is a downturn and smaller budgets .
It 's always that near - term focus . "
And so the United States may lose its ability to understand what 's happening on and to the planet .
" The agencies will not be able to provide key environmental data that are important for sustaining climate and space weather measurements , " the GAO report concludes .
For Abdalati , the ability to observe Earth from space is fundamental to U.S. interests .
" If we just step back as a society and ask , ' How important is it that we understand how and why our Earth is changing ? '
Regardless of where you fall on man-made influences to climate change , we can all agree that there is a need to figure out what 's going on and what 's coming . "

WASHINGTON – A new poll shows European countries strongly supportive of international intervention to stop a nuclear - armed Iran , including further sanctions .
By overwhelming numbers , citizens of Germany , France and Sweden said that they wanted the international community to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons – by 80 percent , 83 % and 90 % respectively – rather than agreeing that Iran has the right to develop nuclear weapons .
Those surveyed in the three countries also said they want to see the EU impose further sanctions .
Germans answered that they wanted additional sanctions by a 70 - 22 margin , French by a 66 - 27 margin and Swedes by a 78 - 15 margin .
In addition , significant majorities of all three groups had cool rather than warm feelings towards Iran .
The poll was conducted by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research from The Israel Project over the second and third week of July .
It was conducted of just over 1,000 people in Germany and France , and 500 in Sweden .
The margin of error was +/- 3.1 percent in France and Germany and 4.5 +/- percent in Sweden .
The Israel Project declined to comment on whether a possible military strike had been another possible type of international intervention posed to those surveyed .
US : Iran Threatens Family of Nuclear Defector Shahram Amiri Iranian scientist at center of spy intrigue was key source for CIA .
June 28 , 2010  --
This story has been updated .
The Iranian government has threatened to harm the family of a nuclear scientist who defected to the U.S. and helped provide crucial details about Iran 's burgeoning weapons program unless he returns home , according to people in the intelligence community briefed by the CIA .
The high - stakes spy saga is being played out online , where both the Iranian intelligence agency and the CIA have posted dueling videos of the scientist .
In one video , he claims the U.S. kidnapped him , in the other he says he is happy to be in the U.S .
Behind the scenes , the situation has become so grave that American officials fear Amiri could re-defect , according to the people briefed on the situation .
A full report on the case will be broadcast Monday on ABC's " World News with Diane Sawyer " and " Nightline . "
At the center of the intrigue is Shahram Amiri , an Iranian nuclear scientist , who officials say operated within Iran as a key CIA spy for several years before his defection .
Amiri apparently provided crucial information , though his precise role in U.S. intelligence gathering remains unclear .
Former and current intelligence officials told ABC News that Amiri confirmed the existence of a secret underground enrichment facility near Qom and also described him as a key source in the conclusions of the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate , which found that Iran had suspended its nuclear weaponization program .
Initially , before Amiri defected back to Iran , the same officials told ABC News that Amiri 's information had contradicted the 2007 NIE finding , but further reporting indicates that was an incorrect interpretation .
CIA director Leon Panetta told ABC News yesterday on This Week that the CIA no longer believes the conclusions of the 2007 NIE , saying that Tehran continues " to work on designs " for a nuclear weapon .
" I think they continue to develop their know - how , " Panetta said .
" They continue to develop their nuclear capability . "
CIA officials pushed for Amiri to flee the country out of fear that his disclosures might expose him to Tehran as a spy .
Amiri vanished last year during a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia .
The Iranian government claimed then that their scientist , a professor at Tehran 's Malek Ashtar University , had been kidnapped by the CIA .
In fact , say U.S. officials , the CIA , with the help of the Saudi government , whisked Amiri to the U.S. , where he was to permanently resettle .
Competing Amiri Videos
A few months after Amiri arrived , the Obama Administration announced that U.S. intelligence had discovered a second , hidden nuclear enrichment facility in the Iranian city of Qom .
Both the CIA and the White House have refused to comment on Amiri .
Complicating the defection is the fact that he left behind a wife and child .
Since arriving in the U.S. , and being secluded in Arizona , U.S. officials say Amiri has struggled with his decision to flee Iran .
Then came the alleged threats by Iranian intelligence , which set off the bizarre battle of dueling videos that were released earlier this month .
The first , which was broadcast on Iranian state television , shows Amiri speaking to a computer camera and announcing that the U.S. had drugged and kidnapped him and forced him to Tucson , Arizona .
He appeared to be looking down at a script as he spoke .
According to the two current U.S. officials , Amiri called home earlier this year because he missed his family .
On a second call , Iranian intelligence answered and threatened to harm his son , unless he taped an internet video saying he'd been kidnapped .
Amiri , fearing for his family , agreed , according to a person briefed on the case .
" He missed his son , " said the person .
" And he could n't help calling home to speak to him . "
Within days , the CIA learned that Amiri had given the Iranians a video and moved quickly to produce a version of its own .
The second video shows Amiri well - dressed and manicured with a globe - turned to North America - and chess set behind him as he appears to read from a teleprompter .
He says , in Farsi , that he is happily living in the U.S. and going to school .
He also denied having worked in the Iranian nuclear program and made a plea to his wife and son .
" I want them to know that I never abandoned then , and that I will always love them . "
According to one U.S. official , the CIA intended to produce the video and launch it on the internet before the Iranians had a chance to air their version .
Instead , the video languished at CIA headquarters for weeks , according to a senior intelligence official .
Then , earlier this month , Iranian state television aired the Amiri video .
Within a day , the CIA posted their Amiri video on YouTube , with a user identification of " shahramamiri2010 . "
Amiri Faces Tough Decisions
The Iranian government has since formally requested the U.S. government to return Amiri , accusing the Americans of holding him against his will .
A spokesperson for the State department has acknowledged that the U.S. government has received the request , but has had no further comment .
" The United States does n't force people to defect — that 's a decision they make themselves , " said a U.S. official .
" Mr. Amiri was n't kidnapped , and he certainly was n't tortured .
That 's absurd .
The guy has internet access and the ability to make and transmit videos .
Let 's get real .
If you look at defectors as a group , without commenting on any particular individual , some adjust better than others , and some deal better than others with tugs and pressures from back home .
But , ultimately , they make their own choices . "
One Iranian defector warned that Amiri has some tough decisions ahead .
Reza Kahlili , who still uses a pseudonym to protect his relatives whom he left behind in Iran , told ABC News that Amiri is likely making life or death decisions .
Defecting , Khalili said , " becomes very emotional , and at times you question your sanity and the decisions that you 've made . "
" If he went back …he would be tortured . " Khalili said .
" And then he would certainly be executed . "

Eight years after being ousted as head of Hydro One Inc. , Eleanor Clitheroe is immersed in a new life as an Anglican priest .
But it does n’t require a vow of poverty .
The Ontario government believes she is entitled to a monthly pension of $ 25,637.08 .
But Clitheroe , who earned $ 2.2 million in 2001 , her last full year as the utility ’s chief executive officer , argues she should receive considerably more — $ 33,644.21 a month .
In a case to be heard by the Ontario Court of Appeal on June 15 , Clitheroe argues her Charter rights to liberty and security of the person were violated by Bill 80 , passed by the Legislature in June 2002 .
It was the province ’s attempt to clean house at the publicly owned utility and abolish what was seen as excessive compensation for senior officers .
But a trial judge who dismissed her claim last year found Clitheroe ’s pension entitlements were purely economic interests which are n’t protected by the Charter .
Lawyers for Hydro
One say the legislation stripped away special pension arrangements Clitheroe negotiated when she joined what was then called Ontario Hydro in 1993 .
They included two and , in some cases , three years of credited service for every year actually worked .
But even with those special arrangements gone , Clitheroe , 56 , is doing better than most people , lawyers Benjamin Zarnett and Peter Kolla argue in material filed with the court .
“ The restriction on Clitheroe ’s supplementary pension entitlement is limited to an amount well in excess of the pension income of the average Canadian or even the average Hydro One employee , ” they say .
The average pension income of Canadians in 2005 was $ 14,800 , the court was told .
Meanwhile , Hydro
One pensioners receive , on average , $ 33,122 a year .
Clitheroe , who now ministers in Smithville , near Hamilton , argues the trial judge , Justice Ruth Mesbur , failed to appreciate the significance of a person ’s decision to give up a high - paying private sector job and join the government , mainly because of the security of the pension .
That ’s a “ fundamental personal choice , ” she says , and reducing a promised government pension seriously interferes with that decision .
Clitheroe , who has two law degrees , a masters of business administration and a masters of divinity , articled at the downtown Toronto law firm now known as Torys .
She then went to work for the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce , becoming vice - president of foreign exchange and money - market trading .
Clitheroe joined the Ontario government in 1989 , in part because she was interested in public policy , but also because the government offered a good pension .
She was a deputy minister of finance and joined Hydro in 1993 as its chief financial officer .
The special pension arrangements in her contracts provided :
• In addition to payments Hydro employees receive through their registered pension plan , and in addition to supplementary “ top up ” payments , Clitheroe would be credited with two years of service for every year worked .
This , she argues , was the same deal she was given as deputy minister of finance — and the same benefit every deputy minister receives by virtue of a special order - in - council .

• No reduced pension if she retired before 65 .
• Under terms of a contract negotiated in 2001 , she would receive three years credit for one year of service .
• Performance bonuses would be counted as income when her pension was calculated .
An expert witness in the case , pension consultant Robert Dowsett , testified at the trial last year that it would be a “ mortal blow ” to the pension system in Canada if governments could simply reduce accrued pensions by passing legislation .
Mesbur , the trial judge , said there is no doubt governments have the power to pass such laws .
But they can only divest people of vested rights — including pension rights — if it is done in “ clear , unequivocal and unambiguous ” terms and they do n’t infringe a person ’s Charter rights in doing so .
In Clitheroe ’s case , the government failed on both counts , argues her lawyer , Alan Lenczner .
In material filed in conjunction with this month ’s appeal , Lenczner frames his case as a classic debate over how courts should interpret legislation — the stuff that has polarized the United States Supreme Court .
The wording of the legislation is key , he says .
Unless Bill 80 mentions Clitheroe ’s pension arrangements specifically , one ca n’t say her rights were clearly cancelled by the legislation , Lenczner argues .
The legislation says Hydro pensions are not to exceed what would be paid to employees under a registered and supplementary pension plan .
Since it does n’t actually include any phrases such as “ two years of credited service for each year worked , ” Clitheroe and her lawyer believe there is hope .
Anglican clergy make in the range of $ 50,000 to $ 60,000 a year on average .
The January 2009 court settlement between the Irish Recorded Music Association ( IRMA ) and Eircom cranks into action today as the ISP starts the process of cutting off broadband access to customers found to be repeatedly illegally sharing copyright material , such as songs and movies , over the network .
The ‘ three strikes ’ agreement went ahead despite being brought to court and challenged by the Data Protection Commissioner after it was found that the monitoring and identification of IP addresses by IRMA was not affecting the protection of personal customer data .
From today , IRMA will supply names to Eircom that it has obtained using anti-piracy tracking firm Dtecnet to monitor online copyright infringement .
Eircom will receive the IP address , along with a time stamp and details of the peer - to - peer application used by the customer .
If it is found that an Eircom customer has been illegally sharing ( ‘ sharing ’ refers to either the uploading or downloading of copyright content ) on three separate occasions they will be disconnected from Eircom ’s broadband service for one week , after which service will be denied for one month if their IP address is detected by Dtecnet for a fourth time .
This graduated response is related to music but TV shows and movies fall outside the remit of the Eircom / IRMA court settlement .
Several other Irish ISPs have been contacted by IRMA and asked to implement the three strikes system .
Following the 19 April high court ruling by Judge Peter Charlton in favour of the rights of copyright holders and against the Data Protection Commissioner Billy Hawke ’s privacy concerns , UPC remained adamant that it would not be following suit .
" UPC ’s position remains unchanged following ( the ) judgment .
UPC will do everything necessary to comply with its legal obligations but will not voluntarily agree to implement measures such as a graduated response system in the absence of a legal obligation to do so . "

There is something to cheer in the so - called Year of the Woman .
You do n’t have to credit the Republican Party , which did next to nothing to bring on the wave that swept Carly Fiorina , Meg Whitman , Sharron Angle and Nikki Haley to victory in June ’s primary elections .
Indeed , before the RNC began heralding its Mama Grizzlies , in Sarah Palin ’s typically catchy but grating phrase , it was brushing off complaints about how its roster of 104 rising " Young Guns , " lavished with party attention and resources , included only seven women .
Fiorina and Whitman bought their gleaming California wins with their own money , while Angle charged to victory in Nevada on sheer Tea Party adrenaline .
There ’s certainly nothing progressive about these women , but their brash , unapologetic and largely unsolicited emergence in Republican politics — in American politics — does represent progress , of a sort .
Ad Policy
That being said , it ’s maddening that a party that has resisted every advance of feminism and undermined women ’s economic strength at every turn now claims to embody " the overall triumph of the women ’s movement , " as New York Times columnist Ross Douthat put it .
To appreciate the breadth of the chasm between the party ’s symbolism and its substance , consider the subject of working mothers .
Some of today ’s GOP women , like many more Democratic women before them , have indeed broken barriers by campaigning around the clock with young children at home .
But what does it mean to be " comfortable " with the spectacle of a working mother , as Douthat claims Republicans now are , when you oppose the very supports that would make the lives of working mothers comfortable ?
Fresh new faces aside , the Republican Party ’s stance on the issues that matter to working mothers is as regressive as it has ever been .
Recall how Republicans in Congress , at the behest of their corporate backers , tried mightily to block President Clinton ’s Family and Medical Leave Act , which granted women the right to take unpaid time off to have a baby and still keep their jobs .
The passage of the FMLA in 1993 was a real advance , but it is hardly sufficient .
Because so many more men have lost their jobs in the Great Recession , an increasing number of families depend on a female wage - earner ’s paycheck to survive , and many women simply cannot take unpaid time off to care for a baby without imperiling their families .
President Obama slipped $ 50 million into his budget proposal to aid states interested in addressing this problem by guaranteeing paid leave .
But this item , along with nearly all the other expenditures to blunt the pain of the downturn and restore economic health , has no support from Republicans , who have signed countless pledges to freeze spending , cut taxes and reduce the deficit , regardless of the human consequences .
The new GOP women are at the front of the fiscal conservative pack .
Fiorina , for example , signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge put out by Americans for Tax Reform , promising as a US senator to oppose any new taxes on California citizens or businesses — this when the state desperately needs federal help to close its $ 19.1 billion deficit and is poised to slash daycare , welfare , public school , and drug treatment programs and services for the poor .
Obama has proposed another round of stimulus , which would put $ 50 billion into state coffers to ease the crisis California and other states are experiencing , but fiscal conservatives like Fiorina and South Carolina ’s Haley ( who stands by Governor Mark Sanford ’s notorious decision to refuse federal stimulus money ) oppose such intervention .
The fiscal crisis in the states cuts to the core of women ’s economic security : as Heather Boushey of the Center for American Progress points out , women are suffering the brunt of it because they make up 60 percent of state and local government employees , and they depend disproportionately on the social services , such as childcare , that states provide .
Although the first wave of this recession hit men hardest , Boushey says we are undergoing a shift toward job losses for women as cuts in the public sector mount .
The reductions in childcare subsidies that states are contemplating , for example , will affect a workforce that is 95 percent female ; and at the same time , the loss of services will surely make holding jobs impossible for many former welfare recipients who now , thanks to Democrat - inspired welfare reform , have nowhere else to turn .
Women caught in this crisis definitely can’t count on the GOP ’s new female leaders for solidarity .
California ’s Whitman — she of the $ 1.3 billion eBay fortune — pledges to reduce the lifetime limit on welfare from five years to two if she is elected governor .
Nevada ’s Angle , who makes Sarah Palin look like Eleanor Roosevelt , not only opposes all stimulus spending but wants to phase out Social Security and , for good measure , the IRS .
It ’s insidious how Republicans are deploying women candidates to pitch government belt - tightening to women as the " keepers of the family budget , " as if the stresses of working families are increased by childcare , healthcare , eldercare , after - school and other social programs .
New Hampshire ’s Kelly Ayotte , the Tea Party favorite running for the Senate , who signed the Club for Growth Repeal
It healthcare pledge , declares , " You ca n’t spend money you do n’t have .
Like most New Hampshire families , Joe and I sit around our kitchen table , and we have to prioritize and live within our budget .
Our government should be no different . "
This analogy is not only flawed — the state , unlike individuals , must create the conditions for economic prosperity — it ignores how families frequently borrow money to invest in their future , to pay for education , for example .
It ’s not clear this message is resonating with women .
According to a new survey by the Ms. Foundation for Women and the Center for Community Change , women — especially women of color , low - income women and single mothers — are more likely than men to believe the government should take a more active role in making the economy work ( a majority of men believe this too ) .
It ’s one thing — and not a small thing — to celebrate the strength of women in politics .
But it ’s supremely cynical to do so , as the GOP Year - of - the - Woman revelers have , while working to undercut the strength of women in society .
Now , will the real Mama Grizzlies please rise up ?
So much for insider tips , it looks like Rock Band 3 for Xbox 360 , PS3 , and Wii will add an actual lay - it - out - flat - and - jam - on - it mini - keyboard to its stable of increasingly realistic musical peripherals when it ships in time for the holidays .
Not a standard - sized keyboard , mind you -- it 'll only have 25 black and white keys , where most entry - level synths start at 61 -- but everything else will be unscaled and MIDI - connectable , usable with or away from the game .
USA Today has the scoop straight from Alex Rigopulos , CEO of Rock Band developer Harmonix , who believes that introducing keyboards will " help feed the appetite for music for years to come . "
It may also further deflect criticism from some corners that faux - instrument music games tend to " trivialize " musical performance .
While the keyboard 's a bit small ( as keyboards go ) it is fully functional , and if you want to plug it into a Mac or PC for use with stuff like Apple 's Garage Band or PG Music 's Band - in - a - Box , it sounds like you can using the inbuilt MIDI port .
Adding keys brings Rock Band 's virtual jam tally to seven , including lead and bass guitar , drums , lead vocals , and two more singing harmony .
( Time to cost out upsizing our living rooms ? )
It 's not clear if a stand comes with the keyboard or not -- I 'd wager it will , since setting it on your lap sounds a little anticlimactic , though who knows .
Maybe they 'll ship with an optional strap so you can play it like a half - keytar standing .
How does it work ?
Simple .
The game fires its trademark green , red , blue , yellow , and orange " notes " along a visual stream , and those colors correspond to keys on the keyboard .
As the colors -- sometimes single , sometimes parallel - - race past a rhythm marker ( the current beat ) you play the correlating keys on the keyboard .
If that sounds a little too simplistic , Rock Band 3 will add an optional " pro " mode that 'll let you jam with all 25 keys , shifting its onscreen note display left or right to overlay the correct keys .
Harmonix wants to play up that real - world connection , calling its keyboard peripheral " a real instrument and a real device . "
In the " what 's to play ? " column , Rock Band 3 will add tunes like " Break On Through " by The Doors and " Bohemian Rhapsody " by Queen ( though sadly not The Muppet version ) .
The game itself will get new guitar controllers ( including an actual stringed Fender guitar for use in pro mode ) , better onscreen animations , and the option to change difficulty settings or join / leave a session without interrupting songs .
What I 'm waiting for ?
Two things .
The option to plug my full - sized , 88 - key graded hammer action Yamaha P - 120 into the game ( hey , it 's MIDI compatible , so ... ) , and a chance to funk out with Herbie Hancock 's " Chameleon . "

Fringe season two did n't end with a gonzo shock like the undamaged Twin Towers at the end of season one .
But that 's okay , because it gave us a zillion things to think about , especially in its final moments .
Spoilers ahead ...

Our heroes succeeded in rescuing Peter Bishop , after he 'd already figured out that his birth dad did n't actually want to give him a pony .
And Walter got some quality time at last with William Bell , who explained some stuff and gave Walter some closure .
And Olivia met her match - leading to a cunning substitution .
So here 's some stuff to think about :
1 ) Was it really just Walter who caused all of that damage to the Other Side ?
That seems like a hell of a lot of damage for just one trip .
Especially when we 're told over and over that William Bell has made the voyage so many times , he 's turned his molecules into a universe worth of atom bombs ?
Still , the extent of the carnage in the alternate Earth was horrifying , and the glimpse of all those people trapped inside amber by the Fringe Division 's containment mechanism was the best special effect the show 's ever had .
Advertisement
Actually , second best .
The best special effect is John Noble 's acting , especially this time around .
Walter 's reaction as he and Bell drive across the gray , dead countryside and he sees just what he 's done is ... amazing .
And Walternate continues to be a bravura performance as well .
2 ) Was William Bell telling the truth about anything ?
I know , I know - he 's dead now , and the Law of Television is that when a character 's dead , you generally have to take their word for stuff .
You do n't generally find out a character 's lying unless you can see that character get confronted and ' fess up .
Plus , this was clearly meant to be the " closure " episode for William Bell , thanks to Nimoy retiring .
And yet ... I still wonder .
Did Walter really ask Bell to take a piece of his brain out ?
What exactly was Bell doing working with Walternate ?
Did the " other " William Bell really die in a car crash ?
The more William Bell said we had to trust him , the less I did .

3 ) How long is it going to take for our crew to see through Fauxlivia ?
That 's the best name I can think of for her .
She wo n't have the same chemistry with Peter that Olivia has , and she just seems too full of life and energy and character , and all the stuff that Olivia lacks .
Makes you wonder how hard it 's been for Anna Torv to act dead - eyed all this time .
4 ) Why did Walternate do the switcheroo with the two Olivias ?
I mean , they captured " our " Olivia , and that should have been enough to stop the escape attempt in its tracks .
If the goal was to keep hold of Peter , then why not do the simplest thing ?
I wonder if this will be explained next season or if it 's just a plot hole .
Advertisement
5 ) What did William Bell mean when he said Peter is holding up well ?
Is there yet another problem with Peter 's health or metaphysical consistency that we 're not aware of yet ?
Peter is such a fragile flower .
Is Peter going to turn into a trillion atom bombs ?
6 ) What are they doing to Olivia in the alternate universe ?
They 've only had her as their prisoner for a couple days , and she 's already fallen to pieces .
That was genuinely scary and alarming .
Advertisement
7 ) Is there a way to fix the other universe without destroying ours ?
Ca n't the two Walters put their heads together and figure something out ?
With the double Walter brain power , it would probably take them an afternoon .
Tops .
And is anybody else disappointed that we got Olivia / Fauxlivia action , but no Walter / Walternate confrontation ?
8 ) Does Olivia really love Peter , like she seemed to hint , or was that just a strategem that her frosty brain came up with ?
Can anybody tell what Olivia 's really feeling - even Olivia ?
And as a side note , you could tell that this episode was co-written by movie scribe Akiva Goldsman .
Brilliant though it was , it definitely had a few moments of big - screen movie dialogue , where people make loudly subtle declarations , including Peter to Walter at the end .
Advertisement
9 ) Why ca n't Peter see Walter 's point of view ?
It 's not rocket science , really .
10 ) Can it be next fall now please ?
What did you all think ?
opinion Telstra ’s management will come to regret its $ 11 billion deal with NBN
Co signed this afternoon as the most disastrous decision it has ever made in the telco ’s long and tortured history in Australia ’s telecommunications sector .
The decision is so bad that it will eventually come to dwarf the hiring of chief executive Sol Trujillo and the 2005 chop in retail broadband rates below wholesale prices in terms of the infamy in which it will come to be regarded within Telstra ’s ranks .
The reasons for this are simple .
Firstly , the agreement — in a single fatal stroke — attempts to transform the fundamental nature of Telstra ’s business , changing it from an engineering company which primarily builds and operates telecommunications networks into a retail service provider focused on delivering the best customer service and value - add products in Australia ’s telco sector .
This is simply not a role to which Telstra is well suited .
When Telstra has finished migrating its fixed - line telephone and broadband customers onto the National Broadband Network , it will find they have little incentive to continue to give it their business .
Despite the onset of strong competition in the telco sector , many Telstra customers ( especially families and businesses ) have remained with Telstra for years because they do not want to go through the hassle of untangling their complex telecommunications arrangements ( fixed - line broadband and telephony , mobile phones , mobile broadband and so on ) into separate carriers .
But the technological disruption associated with the migration of their services to the NBN will provide Telstra customers with a once in a lifetime reason to look at rival providers .
When they do , they will find that there is almost no reason to remain with Telstra .
The NBN is the great leveller for Australia ’s telecommunications sector .
It will remove any ability for Australian telcos to compete for customers ’ money by building better network infrastructure ( an advantage Telstra has historically exploited to the maximum ) .
Instead , telcos will be forced to compete on the grounds of having better prices , customer service or value - added services .
It is a fact as plain as day that Telstra cannot compete with the likes of smaller telcos like iiNet , Internode or even Optus when it comes to customer service .
Despite the best efforts of its chief executive David Thodey , Telstra ’s customer service continues to stink .
After all … when you call iiNet ’s customer service centre you do n’t get transferred around endlessly between different departments .
Telstra will never suffer itself to compete on price — the very idea is an abomination in its internal thinking .
And value - added services are increasingly becoming the province of third - party companies , especially when it comes to content — one need only look at the growing number of IPTV and video on demand services launching this year from the TV networks and third parties to see that trend in action .
One possible exception to this disastrous trend for Telstra may be the corporate sector , where Telstra has expertise that smaller telcos may struggled to match .
But even in that area the big T will suffer — the likes of Optus , AAPT and Macquarie Telecom have been carving chunks off Telstra ’s dominance in that market for years .
Yes , the Federal Government may be providing Telstra with some $ 9 billion to migrate its customers to the NBN , but Telstra will need every penny of that money — because many of those customers will flip Telstra the bird as soon as they join the NBN and hitch their fate to the likes of iiNet instead .
Even if you discount the likely flood of biblical proportions of Telstra customers leaving the ship when the NBN migration takes place , however , the telco has another major problem .
What is it going to spend its $ 11 billion windfall from the Federal Government on ?
Telstra already struggles to find enough places to invest its money .
Despite the fact that Telstra re-engineered almost every single aspect of its network infrastructure during the years from 2005 through 2009 ( spending billions and billions under the strategy of then - CEO Trujillo ) , the company ’s net profits barely took a hit and have already almost recovered , according to its latest annual report , reaching $ 4.08 billion for the year to 30 June 2009 , compared with $ 4.31 billion in mid-2005 .
Likewise , its free cash flow dipped in 2007 to $ 2.9 billion , down from $ 5.2 billion in 2005 – but has recovered quickly to reach $ 4.36 billion last year .
In 2010 Telstra is predicting it will generate free cash flow of $ 6 billion .
Now obviously this is a high - level glossing over of the situation – Telstra ’s financial situation is a complex minefield — and we have n’t gone into any real level of analysis into the company ’s complicated balance sheet ( or , more accurately , complicated cascading series of balance sheets that descends into a nighmare of detail that gives even seasoned telco financial analysts migraines ) .
But the fact remains that Telstra currently generates a stack of cash every year and keeps much of it sitting around … at 30 June last year it had $ 1.38 billion in cash sitting in the bank and a further $ 4.8 billion in current assets .
It ’s a lovely little stockpile — and it just keeps on growing .
Traditionally Telstra has invested much of its overflow in its fixed - line networks .
Building out fixed infrastructure is quite expensive , as Communications Minister Stephen Conroy is discovering with the $ 43 billion ( plus Telstra ’s $ 11bn , for a total of $ 54 billion ) NBN policy .
But Telstra ’s agreement with NBN
Co means that that avenue will no longer be open to it .
Some will argue — rightfully — that Telstra will now focus on building mobile infrastructure instead of fixed — a favourite target of Trujillo due to the ACCC ’s light regulation touch there , which came about due to the strong levels of mobile competition being posed by Optus , Vodafone and Hutchison .
But mobile networks are cheap .
Telstra famously spent just $ 1 billion on its contract with Ericsson to build its flagship Next G network .
Even if you assume the big T spent a further $ 1 billion in internal effort and has spent another cool billion enhancing Next G’s speed over the past few years , Next G still looks cheap compared with similar fixed - line investments .
All of this begs the question of where Telstra will invest its growing cash pile — including the Government ’s $ 11 billion purse .
Any area that I can think of that Telstra could invest in would take the company clearly outside the area of its core competencies .
And this is a very dangerous thing for a company as large and fixed in its ways as Telstra .
Former monopolies do not easily or quickly change their stripes .
Telstra is pretty much prohibited from acquiring other telcos in Australia and consolidating its market presence – any acquisition of scale would likely get knocked back by the ACCC and raise a political outcry besides .
Unlike SingTel , Telstra has never really demonstrated any real aptitude for investing in international telecommunications markets .
Its CSL New World investment in Hong Kong grew steadily in the year to 30 June 2009 , but the revenue growth in that year is not significant when compared to Telstra ’s wider operations — a measly $ 72 million .
The company ’s NZ subsidiary TelstraClear actually went backwards by $ 15 million in 2009 .
If I were to say why that happened , I would guess it ’s because the business again is just not large enough for Telstra ’s Australian management to pay it the correct level of attention .
Another option for Telstra is to expand into markets adjacent to its own .
The most likely one would be new media / content – a field Telstra has long toyed with .
Its long - running interest in its Foxtel joint venture is one example of this attention — as were Trujillo ’s new media acquisitions in China and even the speculation that Telstra could one make a play for the Fairfax empire .
The problem with the idea that Telstra might become a media giant is , unfortunately , that if it attempts to do so , it will suffer the same difficulties that the telco did with its $ 333 million buyout of Australian IT services group KAZ in mid-2004 .
As David Thodey well knows — because he oversaw the KAZ business for years in his role as group managing director for Telstra ’s Enterprise and Government division —
Telstra was never able to integrate KAZ into its operations and was ultimately forced to sell it , because the nature of the IT services market is fundamentally different from Telstra ’s strength in network construction and operation .
Just last year Telstra sold KAZ to Fujitsu and abandoned its attempt to play in a market that , after all , was much more adjacent and compatible to Telstra ’s core strengths than a new media or content business would be , the company ’s encouraging efforts in IPTV and video on demand notwithstanding .
This situation would be even worse if Telstra attempted to invest in a market — say , mining — that is drastically removed from its strengths .
This has always been the problem with Thodey ’s leadership of Telstra .
In the more than a year since the former IBM executive took the reins of Australia ’s telecommunications warhorse , he has failed to clearly articulate to shareholders where Telstra ’s future revenue growth could come from .
Today ’s $ 11 billion deal with NBN
Co has just made that problem a thousand times worse .
Now , let ’s not pretend Telstra ’s NBN
Co deal has no upside .
For the Government , the deal is fantastic — it resolves Telstra ’s integrated retail / wholesale nature while also ensuring a speedy and convenient fibre rollout through the use of Telstra ’s ducts and delivering the NBN a guaranteed massive customer base .
Telstra ’s rivals must be jumping for joy at the idea that they will finally be able to compete with the telco on an even footing , and of course customers will benefit from getting fibre broadband faster and with more competition .
Telstra may be the great tottering grand - daddy from which Australia ’s entire telecommunications sector was spawned .
But pity is not always offered for those that make gross mistakes of judgment .
Thodey ’s hubristic belief that he can heal Telstra ’s acrimonious relationships with the public and Government will likely come back to bite him and Telstra itself .
As a certain Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam said in Frank Herbert ’s classic sci- fi novel Dune : “ The boy may be worth saving , but for the father , nothing . ”

A Wild Duck Chase
So I was driving along the highway yesterday on my way to meet a customer when I noticed a paper bag on the road .
I get a little closer and realize it's not a random piece of debris , but three tiny ducklings !
Being in traffic , I could n't swerve in time , so I did my best to make sure they went under my car and checked the rear view mirror to make sure they were still there .
They looked dazed , but were still moving and the car behind me avoided them .
Instantly the adrenaline started going along with the guilt of possibly hurting baby ducks .
I make it about a half mile further when I realize that nobody else is going to do anything to help because the left shoulder is too narrow and you can't stop ... so I exit and loop back .
I get into the left lane , slow way down with the hazards and pull right up to the ducklings .
There were only two left at this point , but luckily they had made it to the left shoulder .
I happened to have a box with me so I grabbed it , stopped the car and leaped out , intending to scoop them up quickly and be on my way .
Instead of thanking me - the two !
#$ %$ # #ers took off running !
So there I am flailing with a box and running full boar down the freeway ... Luckily I caught up and managed to get both into the box and make it back safely to the car .
The two ducklings were in total shock in the pic above and it took them a good two hours to snap out of it .
We gave them a warm box for the night and plenty of food and drink , but unfortunately , the smaller one died hours later .
It was having problems standing , poor thing had a bad day .
The bright side is that the other guy made it through the whole ordeal unscathed .
I took this pic the next morning after he enjoyed a hearty breakfast of meal worms and some greens .
The stars were on this little duckling 's side as that night , we randomly caught a bit on the local news about how the Audobon Society in Portland will care for orphaned ducklings ( though they do ask you some questions to make sure they are indeed orphaned and to make sure you are n't unintentionally kidnapping the little guys ) .
We 're still a little saddened by the loss , but at least one made it through ok .
And in case anyone is wondering , the people at the Audobon Society said that the duckling was a mallard and probably hybridized because its markings are a little darker than normal .
If you live in Portland , I recommend visiting their facility , it 's pretty interesting and they have some really beautiful birds living there .
The photos here demonstrate , sometimes the best test is the simplest one :
You ’ll only know a failed state when you see it .
The 10 states that fill out the top ranks of this year ’s Failed States Index — the world ’s most vulnerable nations — are a sadly familiar bunch .
Shattered Somalia has been the No. 1 failed state for three years running , and none of the current top 10 has shown much improvement , if any , since Foreign Policy and the Fund for Peace began publishing the index in 2005 .
Altogether , the top 10 slots have rotated among just 15 unhappy countries in the index ’s six years .
State failure , it seems , is a chronic condition .
( Pics )
This year ’s index draws on 90,000 publicly available sources to analyze 177 countries and rate them on 12 metrics of state decay — from refugee flows to economic implosion , human rights violations to security threats .
Taken together , a country ’s performance on this battery of indicators tells us how stable — or unstable — it is .
And unfortunately for many of the 60 most troubled , the news from 2009 is grave .
At the top of the list , Somalia saw yet another year plagued by lawlessness and chaos , with pirates plying the coast while radical Islamist militias tightened their grip on the streets of Mogadishu .
Across the Gulf of Aden , long - ignored Yemen leapt into the news when a would - be suicide bomber who had trained there tried to blow up a commercial flight bound for Detroit .
Afghanistan and Iraq traded places on the index as both states contemplated the exit of U.S. combat troops , while already isolated Sudan saw its dictator , Omar Hassan al - Bashir , defy an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court and the war - ravaged Democratic Republic of the Congo once again proved itself a country in little more than name .
Even good news for these plagued states came tempered by hard facts .
A coalition government in Zimbabwe whipped history ’s second - worst bout of hyperinflation , fostering the country ’s first year of positive growth in more than a decade , and Sri Lanka crushed its Tamil Tiger insurgency .
But Robert Mugabe ’s security goons still rule Harare unchecked , while the Sri Lankan government stands accused of committing gross human rights violations .
Given time and the right circumstances , countries do recover .
Sierra Leone and Liberia , for instance , no longer rank among the top 20 failing states , and Colombia has become a stunning success story .
Few remember today that the Dominican Republic once vied with its neighbor Haiti for the title of “ worst Caribbean basket case . ”
But the overall story of the Failed States Index is one of wearying constancy , and 2010 is proving to be no different : Crises in Guatemala , Honduras , Iran , and Nigeria — among others — threaten to push those unstable countries to the breaking point .
1. Somalia – FSI score : 114.3 ( out of 120 )
Somalia has topped the Failed States Index for the last three years — a testament not only to the depth of the country ’s long - running political and humanitarian disaster , but also , as James Traub writes , to the international community ’s inability to find an answer .
After two decades of chaos , the country is today largely under the control of Islamist militant groups , the most notorious and powerful of which is al - Shabab .
A second faction , Hizbul Islam , rivals the former in brutality — it recently executed two Somalis for the crime of watching the World Cup .
Off the coast , pirates such as the men pictured here torment passing ships , often holding them hostage for a high price .
In 2009 , Somali pirates earned an estimated $ 89 million in ransom payments .
2. Chad – Score : 113.3
Chad ’s troubles are often written off as spillover from the conflict taking place in next - door Darfur , Sudan .
But this central African country has plenty of problems of its own .
An indigenous conflict has displaced approximately 200,000 , and life under the paranoid rule of Chadian President Idriss Déby is increasingly miserable .
Déby has arrested opposition figures and redirected humanitarian funding to the military in recent years .
Matters might soon get worse as the U.N. peacekeeping mission in the country ’s east , where the bulk of the refugees reside , begins to depart on July 15 .
Pictured here , local Chadians in the village of Dankouche struggle to share scarce resources such as firewood with a nearby Sudanese refugee camp .
3. Sudan – Score : 111.8
The next year will prove a decisive one for Sudan , perhaps more so than any other since the country ’s independence in 1956 .
In January 2011 , the people of South Sudan will vote in a referendum on whether they would prefer to remain an autonomous region — or secede as an independent state .
All analysts predict it will be the latter , but they are equally certain that it wo n’t be so easy .
President Omar Hassan al - Bashir is likely to cling close to his control of the South , where much of the country ’s oil riches lie .
This is to say nothing of Darfur , where peacekeepers recently reported an uptick in violence with hundreds killed .
In this scene , children crowd around a U.N. helicopter in the South Sudanese town of Akobo .
4. Zimbabwe – Score : 110.2
Life in Zimbabwe has undoubtedly gotten better since a power - sharing agreement between Robert Mugabe , who has ruled this southern African country since 1980 , and Morgan Tsvangirai , his most prominent opponent and the current prime minister , entered into force in February 2009 .
Inflation is down from 230 million percent , goods are back on the shelves , NGOs are able to work again ( though they are often still harassed ) , and the country is able to tap into foreign credit lines from regional banks and China .
The bad news is that Mugabe has kept up his dictatorial rule as if nothing had changed ; for example , he celebrated his 30th anniversary in office to the spectacular fanfare seen here , where children display militant loyalty to the ruling party .
Mugabe and Tsvangirai operate autonomously , holding occasional talks to resolve disputes over cabinet appointments , land expropriation , opposition arrests , and media freedom — among other things .
With little sign of progress for months , both leaders are now looking forward to fresh elections as the “ only way out ” of the political stalemate , as Tsvangirai has put it .
5. Democratic Republic of the Congo – Score : 109.9
The Democratic Republic of the Congo is the epitome of a country cursed by its resources .
Blessed with perhaps the world ’s single most abundant , diverse , and extractable supply of minerals , Congo has been exploited from the moment its riches were known — first by Belgian colonialists , then by miserable kleptocrats , and today by the Army and various rebel groups and militias .
Meanwhile , miners , such as those seen here , work for meager wages .
For all the country ’s mineral wealth , today it has little to show for it save one of the world ’s most desperate humanitarian situations .
Although the International Rescue Committee ’s estimated death toll of 5.4 million since 1998 has been contested , no one doubts that hundreds of thousands , if not more , have died — not from fighting but from disease .
6. Afghanistan – Score : 109.3
To anyone who has followed the news over the last decade , Afghanistan needs no introduction .
An ongoing U.S. - led military operation there is working town by town and safe haven by safe haven to defeat the Taliban , the Islamist movement that ruled the country until its overthrow after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks .
But the weak and fraying government of President Hamid Karzai , reelected under dubious conditions last August and presiding over a deeply corrupt administration , has thwarted those efforts .
Now , with the self - imposed U.S. deadline to begin pulling out troops just a year away , many are wondering if conditions will permit the international forces to leave .
Here , women in the capital city of Kabul stand patiently — even as a nearby explosion sends passersby into a frenzy .
7. Iraq – Score : 107.3
Iraq rocketed to the top of the Failed States Index after a 2003 U.S. military invasion ousted the dictator Saddam Hussein and set off a period of violent turmoil .
Amid the explosion of sectarian killings and reprisals that followed , more than 2 million Iraqis fled the country , and many have yet to return .
Although Iraq has calmed dramatically since the violence peaked in 2007 , the country remains deeply polarized along ethnic and religious lines .
Recent parliamentary elections were among the freest in the Arab world , but were marred by suicide attacks and allegations of fraud , and a new government has yet to be named .
Any number of factors could prove destabilizing going forward : tension over oil rights , latent Sunni-Shiite hostility , the pullout of U.S. combat troops by Sept.
1 . An April 23 attack in Baghdad is pictured here , on a day when 58 died in similar assaults throughout the country .
8. Central African Republic – Score : 106.4
The Central African Republic should have calmed down by now ; peace deals in 2007 and 2008 brought rebels into the government ’s fold .
But banditry and violence are still common , and lately the country has played unintentional host to the Lord ’s Resistance Army , a legendarily brutal group of rebels that has been pillaging and abducting new “ recruits ” and hapless children after being chased out of nearby Uganda .
Meanwhile , François Bozizé , a former army chief of staff who came to power in a 2003 coup , has drained the country ’s wealth for the benefit of his small cadre .
The country has known little if any modernization since its independence from France a half - century ago .
Here , a man watches a burning village set aflame with the intention of warding off snakes and scorpions — and boosting fertility .
9. Guinea – Score : 105.0
The last 18 months have been a roller - coaster ride for this small West African country , with far more downs than ups .
After Guinea ’s longtime president died in December 2008 , a group of renegade soldiers seized power , naming a rogue Army captain , Moussa Dadis Camara , as president .
Camara quickly proved to be a delusional , erratic , and violent ruler .
In September 2009 , Guinean troops massacred 150 opposition protesters at the country ’s national stadium , provoking international outrage .
Months later , Camara was shot by one of his own guards , who claimed that the junta leader was forcing him to take the fall for the massacre .
The injured Camara was flown out of the country for medical care and his deputy , Sékouba Konaté , took charge together with a civilian prime minister .
Elections to seat a permanent government are promised for June 27 — the first good news this heavily militarized country has had for a while .
In this photo , tanks prepare to bring a 2007 general strike to heel .
10 . Pakistan – Score : 102.5
Pakistan has more than once been described as the world ’s most dangerous country .
Its wild northern reaches remain host to various branches of the Pakistani Taliban and likely to al Qaeda ( Osama bin Laden is thought to be among them ) , while other militant groups make gains closer to urban areas .
The bomb that went off here left six dead in Quetta , in the country ’s southwest .
More than 3 million Pakistani civilians were displaced by “ counterinsurgency ” operations in 2009 — the largest single movement of people since the Rwandan genocide .
Meanwhile , President Asif Ali Zardari ’s democratically elected government looks hapless — unable to gain any measure of civilian control over a nuclear - armed military obsessed with planning for a war with India , or an intelligence service that stands accused of abetting the Afghan Taliban .
11 . Haiti – Score : 101.6
As 2010 began , Haiti was finally making progress : Donor funds were flooding in , the government was on its feet , and there was more optimism than at any point in the last two decades .
And then , in the span of a few seconds , everything fell apart .
The 7.0 magnitude earthquake that hit Haiti on Jan. 12 created one of the worst humanitarian disasters in recent memory .
Today , some 230,000 Haitians are thought to have died , with more than 1 million homeless and 2 million in need of food aid .
For the country ’s people — such as the man seen here drinking street water from a makeshift straw — as well as its government and donors , the temblor has been an epic tragedy , setting back years of painstaking development efforts .
12 . Ivory Coast – Score : 101.2
They signed a peace deal in 2007 , but today , the Ivory Coast ’s northern and southern regions are more divided than ever over how to share the country ’s resources .
Elections to replace the current government , which took office in a 2003 power - sharing agreement , were scheduled to have taken place in 2005 .
A half - decade later , the country has yet to finalize an electoral list , and violence once again looms .
Nor has the country been rebuilt ; the houses pictured here were ransacked back in 2002 .
This young boy is malnourished — as one in every five children in the Ivory Coast are .
13 . Kenya – Score : 100.7
Kenya , like the Ivory Coast , has lately shown that power - sharing arrangements can be as divisive as the conflicts they are meant to end .
In Nairobi , the country ’s president and prime minister have been perpetually at odds since their forced marriage in 2008 .
The government has done little to investigate or make amends for that year ’s explosion of election - related violence .
An exasperated Kofi Annan , the former U.N. secretary - general who helped resolve the electoral dispute , has given the International Criminal Court names of people who are implicated — because Kenya seems unwilling to try them itself .
Meanwhile , for the average Kenyan , all this has proved a distraction from everyday concerns .
Villagers in northeastern Kenya , pictured here , carry water amid a drought of the sort that often threatens regional famine .
14 . Nigeria – Score : 100.2
Nigeria ’s infamous political instability was in the news with unfortunate frequency in recent months , as the country ’s president fell ill , disappeared for medical care , and eventually passed away , leaving control to his vice president , Goodluck Jonathan .
Meanwhile , a combination of intercommunal violence in the country ’s middle belt ( corpses from which are seen buried here ) , a flailing amnesty program in the oil - rich Niger Delta , police brutality , scathing poverty , and rampant corruption has kept this West African country in the ranks of the world ’s most dysfunctional states .
15 . Yemen – Score : 100.0
Decades of conflict and insecurity have made AK - 47s a status symbol in Yemen on par with the country ’s traditional dress .
Attempted Christmas Day bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab trained in Yemen , and despite U.S. military aid , there is little sign that the central government is capable of rooting out militant groups such as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula .
Throw in declining oil revenues , failing water supplies , an internal rebellion or two ( the destruction from which is manifest here ) , and an influx of Somali refugees , and the question becomes when , not if , Yemen ’s ticking time bomb will go off .

Hank Johnson Congress : Guam Tipping Over Video – Hank Johnson , a very well respected Congressman has addressed some concern that he believes Guam is at risk of tipping over and capsizing .
Yes that ’s right , actually crumbling apart .
At a House Armed Services committee Hank Johnson was speaking with a commander of the United States Pacific fleet about the effect that the Marines and families of the Marines are having on Guam .
Johnson told the commander that he is truly fearing that the entire island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize .
I could n’t think of anything more horrible that to witness that happening and if it ’s true , I am glad the issue is being addressed ahead of time , we need to get this issue sorted out .
Johnson may not have expected this but the video of him making these remarks quickly spread to the media and when viral .
All over the internet people are talking about the congressman ’s latest remarks .
Johnson has since tried to speak out on his concern and why he said what he did .
He said , “ i was using a metaphor to say that with the addition of 8,000 Marines and their dependents – an additional 80,00 people during peak construction to the port on the tiny island with a population of 180,000 – could be a tripping point which would adversely affect the island ’s fragile ecosystem and overburden its already overstressed infrastructure . ”
Judging by that statement it seems that the Congressman is still very concerned with the issue and with Guam ’s increase in terrorism things are sure to become published very soon .

news The Fourteen Essential G20 Videos
Photo by Christopher Drost / Torontoist .
It ’s been days now since the G20 ended , and the details and extent of what actually happened across downtown Toronto over the weekend — on Saturday , along Queen and King and Yonge streets and at Queen ’s Park ; on Sunday night , at Queen and Spadina ; throughout the weekend , at the temporary detention centre on Eastern Avenue ; and just about everywhere else — are still unfolding .
It helps , though , that video evidence is everywhere , shot by everyone from aspiring directors to pedestrians with cell phone cameras to professionally trained videographers .
Here are the fourteen G20 videos that we ’ve been able to find , or that have been sent to us , that we think are the most important ones for everyone in Toronto to see .
WHAT IT ’S OF :
The police car attacked and set ablaze on Saturday afternoon at King and Bay .
WHO SHOT IT : Ryan Walker / Torontoist .
KEY MOMENT : The whole thing , but especially after 0:34 , when Walker gets out into the street .
WHAT IT ’S OF : Some of the most dramatic action from Saturday , in a video that is ( unlike many of the others included here ) more heavily edited .
WHO SHOT IT : Miguel Barbosa of YEAH !
Films , who also shot more peaceful protests over the weekend .
KEY MOMENT : 0:42 , when black - clad rioters surround and start to attack a police car at Queen and Spadina , with a police officer still inside , and other officers rush in to help .
Click the image above to launch CTV ’s video .
WHAT IT ’S OF : Looters , Black Bloc–ers , protesters , pedestrians , cyclists , and media making their way up Yonge Street on Saturday , in ten minutes of unedited footage .
As others who watched similar looting elsewhere have pointed out , there were no visible police .
WHO SHOT IT : A CTV cameraman .
KEY MOMENT : The whole thing , but especially everything that comes after 2:00 .
WHAT IT ’S OF :
One man tackles a looter , on Yonge south of College on Saturday , about as politely as anyone can . [ :

Two men doing an impromptu strip - tease in front of a line of police officers on Saturday , as the crowd chants “ you ’re sexy , you ’re cute , take off your riot suit . ”
WHO SHOT IT : YouTube user tomekbuga .
KEY MOMENT : All of it .
What ’s important to glean from it is that the tone of most demonstrations were not anything like those that drew the most attention .
Violent protests were still the exception , not the rule , this weekend , as another video from Saturday , by the Toronto Video Activist Collective , or TVAC , demonstrates .
WHAT IT ’S OF : Steve Paikin , host of The Agenda on TVO , explaining what he saw first - hand ( and tweeted about ) on Saturday night at the Novotel Hotel protest .

What it was like inside the kettle at Queen and Spadina on Sunday , as it closed .
WHO SHOT IT : Jason MacDonald , a CTV viewer who was later arrested and taken to the detention centre .
Justin Stayshyn ( who was later detained at the intersection ) shot another video nearby .
KEY MOMENT : 3:05 , when the line of police moves to approach the crowd .
WHAT IT ’S OF :
Of the many allegations made about conditions inside the G20’s temporary detention centre at 629 Eastern Avenue , those from Amy Miller , an independent journalist detained there , are the most serious — she was told , she says , that she was “ going to be raped ” ; she says she witnessed strip searches of women by male officers ; and she also heard at least one allegation of sexual assault .

The International Cricket Council ( ICC ) has officially rejected former Australian prime minister John Howard 's bid for the vice - presidency after a revolt by Asian and African nations .
The ICC has issued a statement saying Mr Howard 's nomination did not have sufficient support within the organisation 's board .
Mr Howard 's nomination for the role of ICC vice - president was rejected by at least six of the 10 Test - playing nations at an ICC executive board meeting in Singapore on Wednesday .
" Following lengthy consideration it was recognised that the nomination ( of Mr Howard ) put forward by Cricket Australia and New Zealand Cricket did not have sufficient support within the ICC board , " the ICC said in a statement .
Australia and New Zealand have been invited to nominate another candidate by the end of August , the statement said .
Cricket Australia says it is " deeply disappointed " Mr Howard 's bid was rejected .
" Effectively it was a bloc of Africa , Asia and the West Indies in the end saying no , " he said .
" [ It 's ] deeply disappointing as I said because it is this region 's turn to nominate a person .
" We followed the process and had expected the normal processs would be followed and he would be endorsed . "
African and Asian nations refused to support Mr Howard , who was ultimately supported by just Australia , New Zealand and England .
" There was nothing personal against Howard , " a source in the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) said .
" But we do accept the argument that only a man with previous experience in cricket administration should head the ICC .
Howard was not involved with Cricket Australia at any time . "
Former BCCI chief Sharad Pawar , a federal minister in the Indian government who has served as ICC vice - president for the last two years , takes over from outgoing president David Morgan of England on Thursday .
Tradition dictates that after Pawar , it is the turn of Australia / New Zealand in 2012 .
Mr Howard was put forward by Cricket Australia as a wily political operator who could boost the governing body 's profile in international sport .
Mr Howard 's tough stance against the Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and past criticism of Sri Lankan bowler Muttiah Muralidaran were believed to be key factors in the ICC 's decision .
In 2007 , he strongly supported Australian umpire Darrell Hair who outraged Pakistan by halting a Test match and awarding victory to England as the South Asian side protested against ball - tampering accusations .
Mr Howard was also a leading critic of Zimbabwe 's regime under Robert Mugabe and included its cricket officials in 2008 sanctions .
The 70 - year - old had hoped to take over as President of the ICC after two years under the organisation 's traditional rotation policy .
Under a rotational five - region electoral process , Mr Howard 's candidacy for vice - president should have been rubber - stamped months ago .
But growing opposition to Mr Howard delayed the decision , which is usually a formality appointment .

On Monday the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment applies to states and cities as well as the federal government .
Judging from their objections , the four dissenters were still reeling from the Court 's landmark 2008 decision recognizing that the amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms .
In their dissenting opinions , Justices John Paul Stevens and Stephen Breyer ( joined by Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor ) worry that overturning gun control laws undermines democracy .
If " the people " want to ban handguns , they say , " the people " should be allowed to implement that desire through their elected representatives .
What if the people want to ban books that offend them , establish an official church , or authorize police to conduct warrantless searches at will ?
Those options are also foreclosed by constitutional provisions that apply to the states by way of the 14th Amendment .
The crucial difference between a pure democracy and a constitutional democracy like ours is that sometimes the majority does not decide .
Likewise , Stevens defends " state and local legislatures ' right to experiment , " while Breyer is loath to interfere with " the ability of States to reflect local preferences and conditions — both key virtues of federalism . "
Coming from justices who think Congress can disregard state decisions about the medical use of marijuana because a plant on the windowsill of a cancer patient qualifies as interstate commerce , this sudden concern about federalism is hard to take seriously .
Another reason to doubt the dissenters ' sincerity :
They would never accept federalism as a rationale for letting states " experiment " with freedom of speech , freedom of religion , or due process protections .
Much of their job , as they themselves see it , involves overriding " local preferences " that give short shrift to constitutional rights .
Second Amendment rights are different , Breyer says , because " determining the constitutionality of a particular state gun law requires finding answers to complex empirically based questions . "
So does weighing the claims in favor of banning child pornography or depictions of animal cruelty , relaxing the Miranda rule , admitting illegally obtained evidence , or allowing warrantless pat - downs , dog sniffs , or infrared surveillance .
When they decide whether a law or practice violates a constitutional right , courts cannot avoid empirical questions .
In cases involving racial discrimination or content - based speech restrictions , for example , they ask whether the challenged law is " narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest " and is the " least restrictive means " of doing so .
But unlike equal protection or freedom of speech , Stevens says , " firearms have a fundamentally ambivalent relationship to liberty . "
How so ?
" Just as they can help homeowners defend their families and property from intruders , " he explains , " they can help thugs and insurrectionists murder innocent victims . "
Every right can be abused , with results that are immoral , illegal , or both .
Freedom of speech can be used to spread hateful ideas , promote pernicious political philosophies , slander the innocent , or engage in criminal conspiracies .
If there were no potential for harm from exercising a right , there would be no need to protect it , because no one would try to restrict it .
The dissenters ' most frivolous objection is that making states obey the Second Amendment " invites an avalanche of litigation , " as Stevens puts it .
Every day we hear about cases in which people argue that the government has violated their rights under the First , Fourth , Fifth , Sixth , or Eighth amendment .
Neither Stevens nor Breyer wants to stop this " avalanche . "
Only when the Second Amendment is added to the mix do they recoil in horror at the prospect that Americans will use the courts to vindicate their rights .
Stevens warns that " the practical significance of the proposition that ' the Second Amendment right is fully applicable to the States ' remains to be worked out by this Court over many , many years . "
But that 's because the Court for many , many years ignored the Second Amendment while gradually defining the contours of its neighbors in the Bill of Rights .
There is a lot of catching up to do .

Well , Glenn Beck has long had a predilection for promoting the work of far - right extremists like Cleon Skousen , as well as promoting a variety of ideas and theories that originated with the extremist right .
But his latest endorsement is simply beyond the pale .
Media Matters has the whole scoop :
On his radio show today , Glenn Beck heralded and promoted the work of Nazi sympathizer Elizabeth Dilling , who spoke at rallies hosted by the leading American Nazi group and praised Hitler .
Today , Dilling is heralded by White Supremacists and White Aryans who revere her " fearless " work against Jewish people .
As Media Matters ' Simon Maloy noted , Beck had kind words for Dilling 's 1934 anti-communist book , The Red Network , saying : " This is a book -- and I 'm a getting a ton of these -- from people who were doing what we 're doing now .
We now are documenting who all of these people are .
Well , there were Americans in the first 50 years of this nation that took this seriously , and they documented it . "
Maloy noted that Dilling has a long history of rabid anti-Semitism , such as calling President Eisenhower " Ike the Kike " and labeling President Kennedy 's New Frontier program the " Jew frontier . "
Professor Glen Jeansonne and writer David Luhrssen note in the encyclopedia Women and War that Dilling was n't only anti-Semitic , but a sympathizer and supporter of the Nazis and Hitler :
When World War II began in 1939 , Dilling was part of the national network of anti-Semitics , anti-Communists , and Nazi sympathizers such as Father Charles Coughlin , Reverend Gerald L. K. Smith , Reverend Gerald Winrod , and William Dudley Pelley .
Material generated by Nazi organizations in Germany to inspire race hated and exploit dissatisfaction in the United States found its way into Dilling 's publications .
She spoke at rallies hosted by the leading U.S. Nazi organization , the German - American Bund , and had traveled to Germany , pronouncing the country as flourishing under Hitler .
Dilling called for appeasing Germany ; she blamed the war on Jews and Communists and accused the Roosevelt administration of being controlled by Jewish Communists .
... After Pearl Harbor , Dilling resisted wartime rationing and denounced the Allies .
So Dilling " spoke at rallies hosted by the leading U.S. Nazi organization , the German - American Bund . "
Who 's the German - American Bund ?
Let Glenn Beck , Elizabeth Dilling fan , tell you :
BECK : The Bund gathered socially and ran Nazi camps .
The camps were advertised as summer retreats where you could escape the city , celebrate German heritage , dance , drink , at places like Camp Nordlund in New Jersey and Camp Siegfried in Long Island .
The camps hidden as pro-German / pro- American were attended by adults and families .
On the outside , they looked like any other camp .
But the children were indoctrinated in the ideals of Nazism , breeding young Americans to become full - fledged Nazis .
They marched , performed drills in Nazi uniforms .
And they were taught about their racial superiority , their potential as Aryan youth .
As media scrutiny of the Bund increase , so did anti-Nazi protests , including other Americans who hated the Nazi image and Jewish - American veterans .
Instead of quieting down , Bund leader Fritz Kuhn decided to hold the largest rally in their history , Madison Square Garden .
These American Nazis showed their true colors , beating a Jewish protester who rushed the stage .
Kuhn and other speeches were nothing more than anti-Semitic rants wrapped in the American flag protected by the First Amendment .
[ Glenn Beck , March 11 ]
British Professors Christopher Partridge and Ron Geaves wrote that Dilling was a " pro-Nazi anti-Semite " who disseminated Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion .
The ADL describes Protocols as " a classic in paranoid , racist literature .
Taken by the gullible as the confidential minutes of a Jewish conclave convened in the last years of the nineteenth century , it has been heralded by anti-Semites as proof that Jews are plotting to take over the world . "
Dilling 's Nazi sympathies have made her a cult hero among Aryan groups and White Nationalists / Supremacists .
For instance , the group Women for Aryan Unity features Dilling in a publication whose purpose is " to honour Aryan Women past and Present . "
Got an iPhone 4 yet ?
Hold it carefully by the glass , avoiding the new steel antenna band that runs around the edges .
Note the number of signal - strength bars you have .
Now , touch the steel band with your other hand , preferably the left and bottom sides together .
You will almost certainly see your signal disappear , or drop by three or four bars .
The problem is being so widely reported that Gizmodo has managed to add 16 videos of the phenomenon , along with many , many user reports .
The problem is also repeatable , making it look like a lot more than simple coincidence .
Wired.com readers are also reporting the problem :
Out of more than 40 respondents , about 35 are reporting a similar pattern of problems :
If you hold the iPhone 4 in your left hand , or touch the lower - left corner of the outside steel band , the signal indicator starts losing bars within a few seconds .
Many respondents indicated that this led to dropped calls , and one , " Edward , " did download speed tests that showed a dramatic drop in throughput when holding the iPhone 4 in his hand , from 2 M bps to a measly 12 Kbps .
Two respondents have said that they 've observed the same diminishing - signal problem with previous models of the iPhone .
Two people have reported that keeping the iPhone 4 in its protective " bumper " case eliminates the problem , probably because it is an electrical insulator and prevents the antenna band from contacting the conductive surface of the skin .
If you have ever touched a bare - metal loop antenna for a TV , you 'll know that the water - filled human body has an effect on the reception , although in that case it usually improves the picture .
In this case , it has the opposite effect .
It 's possible that the antenna band is not a continuous loop , and that touching it in the lower - left corner short - circuits the loop somehow .
This , it turns out , is not entirely unexpected .
Just two weeks ago , Jens Nielsen of Danish blog ComON quoted Professor Gert Frølund Pedersen of the Department of Electronic Systems at Aalborg University :
[ H] uman tissues will in any case have an inhibitory effect on the antenna .
Touch means that a larger portion of the antenna energy turns into heat and lost .
This makes the antenna less efficient to send and receive radio signals .
[ Translation by Google ]
Simply holding the new iPhone in the hand is enough to kill the signal .
Even Walt Mossberg , in his review of the iPhone 4 , had an eerily similar - sounding experience :
[ O ] n at least six occasions during my tests , the new iPhone was either reporting “ no service ” or searching for a network while the old one , held in my other hand , was showing at least a couple of bars .
Neither Apple nor AT&T could explain this .
[ Emphasis added . ]
Is it possible that a problem like this would make it into the wild ?
You'd think that it would have been discovered in testing .
On the other hand , maybe this is what caused Steve Jobs ' connection woes at the WWDC keynote where he demoed the new handset ?
One possible answer is in the way the new antenna works .
Instead of just picking the strongest signal , the iPhone 4 picks the highest quality signal , the frequency with the least amount of interference .
In the current iPhone firmware , this is not yet reflected in the signal display , which still indicates actual strength .
Apple has said that this is a known bug that it plans to fix .
If true , then you should n't actually drop a call , even when your apparent signal - bars drop to zero .
Or perhaps it is all a sinister plot from Apple to sell more of those insulating rubber Bumper cases ?
If you have an iPhone 4 , please test this out for us , and post your experience in the comments .
Specifically , check to see if a decrease in displayed bars corresponds with an actual drop in call quality .

Harry says that ECLIPSE is the first fully complete film of the TWILIGHT series ... well , almost .
Published at : June 29 , 2010 , 2:23 a.m. CST by headgeek
I figured I 'd get this done with before starting the DVD column for the night .
I just got back from seeing ECLIPSE at a local Press screening .
I really do wonder what seeing these press screenings would 've been like had they not allowed the squealing throngs of Twigirls in ...
The problem is , as they bubble over with nervous anticipatory giggles - it becomes incredibly hard to take the films seriously at all ... and it seems that the story itself kind of gave in on it's own yummy teenage anxiousness ...
I 'm sorry , the Edward , Bella , Jacob tent scene ?
OK - so how many folks here have ever been in a love triangle relationship ?
I 've unfortunately been in a couple of those .
They are almost without exception the most deceptive and jealous - ridden situations ever .
AND - if I ever found myself in that tent in a blowing cold mountain top on what could very well have been the last night of my life ?
And if I were a Teenage Girl ....
I 'd totally be all about that doggy & diamond double dicking !
And there was n't a girl in my theater tonight that was n't wondering if the diamond sprinkled vampire skin would be more like the pyrex dildo or the cyberskin one ?
And the team Jacob girls with the German Shepard .... mmhmmm , you know it .
The funny thing is - Every actor in that tent is thinking that too .
And I kinda think that Jacob would be into it , because he does say , " Bella you are capable of loving more than one person . "
So , I 'm pretty damn sure that Jacob almost wants to be the puppy on the floor nestled at the foot of the bed , just waiting to play .
This film is about sex .
The father knows it is either happening or is close to happening .
He 's kinda freaking out , because he does n't know how to act about it , because he looks at Robert Pattinson 's Edward and he can't imagine the teenage girl in him fucking that .
Her mother knows .
We all fucking know they 're all about fucking each other .
Edward has this Victorian hang up about no sex before marriage , it is driving Bella 's hormones into overdrive .
It is the only reason this fucking triangle is going on .
Bella is putting out fuck me pheromones like a bitch in heat - and Jacob 's doggy sensitive nose can not stay out of her crack .
He might be " talking " about her " heartbeat stopping , " but what he really wants is that hymen .
HE KNOWS IT !
That 's why he 's leg humping her at every single chance .
And you can't really hate him like that other guy , because he 's a puppy .
He can't help it .
Just look at those pert always hard boy nipples ?
They 're just so amazingly in focus .
They 're just asking to be nuzzled at the very least .
That there are actual scenes of Edward driving Bella out in the middle of nowhere , just to hand off to Jacob ?
Several times .
When has this actually happened ?
This movie is just so " out " as to what it is , that there is absolutely no way I could n't fucking kinda love it .
This movie is such a thigh squeezer that guys ... if you 're just moderately passibly cute after 3 beers , you might want to go just to try and hook up .
This is absolutely better than WOLVERINE was ... a bit gayer , but ya know ... there 's some cool fucking action , way cuter girls ... well , way cuter guys too , if that like makes you questionable curious or not , might be up to your on threshold for thinking about wonder what it'd be like ...
You know , they 're just so goddamn pretty .
Your girlfriend will probably definitely be thinking about a 3 way with you and one of these guys on screen .
I 'm not just talking about Jacob or Edward .
Your girl might have a thing for Jasper , or that Moose looking mutherfucker .
There 's totally a Hyper Riverdale kinda vibe , mixed with some of the silliness of that whole NEW MUTANTS thing was .
You know .
Teenager superheroes ?
That 's this , but there 's just two types ...
The Furry ones or the Glam ones .
I can giggle through out this fucking thing .
Because ...
I can go home , tell my wife I 'd totally do " ______ " with you ...
And I 'll get laid tonight .
Seriously , that 's the kind of fucking date you have tonight .
You 'll go , you 'll check out that psychic chick , wonder about those two joints and bedding Bella night .
And you 'll totally bring up doing one of those two ... or maybe that redhead , with your girl too .
And SHE WILL be into it too .
Yeah , that 's right .
I 'm a man and I 'm using this shit .
BECAUSE IT WORKS !
And I 'm not too shy to say it .
Because you know this shit works too !
The future of your dick is on the line here .
GO and it will be yours .
This is better than the single 's bar because there 's not 9 sticks per _____ .
You could arrive at a bar with this .
And teenagers , you go with your girl ... this might be a good night for you too .
You know , you do n't have to tell your guy friends you saw it .
I 'm doing that for ya .
So that next time hanging out , that ... " Yeah , I 've had sex " gleam will be showing .
For a guy - that 's what this movie can be .
For a girl , this film is deeply meaningful in a once in a lifetime kind of way .
Use that .
Seriously .
Bugatti's Veyron has reclaimed the title of world 's fastest supercar .
A new version of the vehicle , called the Super Sport , hit 268 mph at Volkswagen 's test track in Ehra - Leissien , Germany .
The Veyron 's previous record of 253 mph was broken in 2007 by the American SSC Ultimate Aero which reached 256mph .
Bugatti test driver Pierre Henri Raphanel piloted the Super Sport over two runs , averaging 431.072 km/h ( 268mph ) .
Uprated specs
The new top speed was reached after Bugatti uprated the specifications of its flagship sportscar .
Its 8.0 litre , 16 cylinder engine remains the same .
However , its four turbochargers have been upgraded and larger intercoolers added .
The new combination raises the Veyron 's power output from 1,001 horsepower to 1,200hp .
Bugatti has also redesigned the car 's bodywork , with an all carbon fibre shell reducing weight .
Top Gear
The standard Veyron 's top speed was famously put to the test on the BBC's Top Gear programme .
Presenter James May reached 253 mph on VW 's Ehra-Leissien track .
Afterwards he said the experience " made my eyes water " .
However , when driven on the programme 's test track , the Veyron only managed 10th place .
Jeremy Clarkson speculated that the vehicle 's relatively heavy weight may have caused it to put in a slower time than cars such as the Caparo T1 and Koenigsegg CCX .

What ’s the best response when a cop asks you something ?
Silence , or a short , polite non-answer .
Shut up .
Just .
Shut . Up .
The police are not your friends .
They are not there to protect you .
They are there to arrest you , convict you , and take your money or your freedom or both .
You should be polite and calm whenever dealing with any armed person .
It ’s even more important when that person knows they can shoot you without any serious consequences .
But do n’t say any more than you have to .
These videos made the rounds about a year ago .
If you have n’t seen them , watch them now .
If you have seen them , watch them again .

World Of Tanks !
Three words that just make so much sense .
It ’s a free - to - play MMO that ’s already doing well in Russian - language lands , is heading Westward .
It really does sound splendid : a garage full of tanks , destructible surroundings , a global map for clans to fight over .
But what of the details ?
Fortunately we ’ve got some of those , right here .
We recently spotted Mike Zhyvets , the game ’s technical director , coming over the horizon and so we positioned our self - propelled 40 mm word - cannon to land questions squarely in his mind .
Read on for a full examination of his response crater .
RPS : Tanks ?
Really ?
How does that work ?
Do players have garages full of different tanks ?
Zhyvets :
The choice of the concept for World of Tanks was n’t random .
We knew that millions of tank enthusiasts around the world were looking forward to playing a team - based MMO featuring authentic panzer models , something that could fully feed their tank driving thirst .
So here we are with World of Tanks focusing on tense online warfare and historically accurate models of fighting vehicles that were designed and produced from the 30’s and up to the Korean War .
We ’ve chosen that era as it ’s the most interesting period of tank building history .
And 20 thousand beta testers we have so far in Russia prove that we were right with both the concept and the setting .
World of Tanks gives players a chance to command nearly 150 historically accurate models of fighting vehicles from America , Germany and USSR as well as explore their strong and weak points in battles .
We will gradually add panzers from other nations like Britain , France , Italy , Japan .
All in all World of Tanks will include about 500 models of fighting vehicles .
By the way , it is not only the tanks that the game features .
Anti-tanks and SPGs are also included in World of Tanks .
Moreover , we are planning to add rocket artillery after the release .
Our first attempt in this direction is the premium RBT - 5 Soviet tank — the light tank that hosted a pair of large artillery rocket launchers .
The players can fill up their garage with all these toys , drive different panzers and see how they work on the battlefield .
The garage can hold from five to dozens of panzers .
Avid tank buffs can get up to 100 tanks in their collections .
RPS : Can you tell us a bit about what the tanks get up to in World Of Tanks ?
I understand that it ’s PvP - focused , but how is that packaged for the player ?
Zhyvets :
Your tank is the main character of the game .
One panzer refers to one player on the battlefield .
Thus , you are a tank commander of your steel monster , fighting shoulder to shoulder with your brothers - in - arms against your enemies in intensive team deathmatch battles .
That is why team cooperation and tactics play an immensely important role for success in every fight .
World of Tanks is not just a run-and - gun game , although solo players will be getting tons of fun and thrill in duels as well .
The gameplay differs depending on the type of a fighting vehicle a player commands .
You can choose a light tank and help your team as a scout by breaking into the enemy ’s rears , spotting the enemy tanks ’ positions or destroying SPGs .
Medium tanks are ” jacks of all trades ” while heavy tanks like IS - 4 or the Royal Tiger represent the team ’s crushing power .
Tank destroyers are perfect defensive units .
With powerful weapons and thick frontal armor , they are capable of engaging enemy vehicles from relatively long distances .
The role of SPGs is slightly different .
They work in tense cooperation with light tanks that scout the map and unveil enemy vehicles for them .
Their extremely powerful weapons may cause a one - shot lethal outcome for any opponent .
As I ’ve said , the basic mode is the team deathmatch , however , more exciting modes like Survival or Garage Wars will be added as well .
We did n’t intend to introduce AI , except the training mode only , as it is always much more challenging to fight against real players in online wargames .
RPS : How do modifications to tanks work ?
( And how do players progress ? )
Zhyvets :
A player will start with a small and funny 1st level tank , which will be Leichttraktor for Germany and MS - 1 for USSR .
By taking part in battles the player earns experience and credits to modify his tank , research and buy a fighting vehicle of a next level .
Every unit has got about 10 modifications with different historically grounded specifications ( sorry , no chance to install a turret from Tiger on your T - 44 ) .
An average tank normally has 2 modifications of turrets , 2 versions of tracks , 3 engine models and 2 - 6 modifications of the main gun .
Having obtained enough credits and experience , the players can buy new vehicles and place them in their garage .
There ’s no limitation on nations or types of panzers to have at one ’s collection .
The German SPG “ Hummel ” can be a neighbor to the Soviet T - 44 at your depot .
Your tank crew levels up as well .
With every new battle , your crew members gain more and more experience , which improves your panzer ’s performance in the battle .
For example , with a veteran gunner aboard , your tank will be more accurate in shooting , while an experienced loader will increase the panzer ’s firing rate .
RPS : The destruction model looks fun – are there any practical limits to what you can blow up ?
Zhyvets :
We have to put up with some certain technical limitations typical for MMO games .
Moreover , we are very precise about the ballistics in the game which leads to additional loads on the server .
Players can’t destroy absolutely everything in World of Tanks , so landscapes remain practically untouched .
Still , all other components of the ingame environment will be totally destructible — cars , hedges , trees , etc .
Buildings can be ruined into splinters with some showy effects as well .
Concerning fighting vehicles , we have implemented multilevel damage system that accounts for tank models ’ various parameters like armor thickness , amour slope , “ soft spots ” typical for a particular panzer , etc .
However , there are some modules like tracks or guns that ca n’t be knocked out completely .
We have added the repair function to prevent nasty situations when two damaged tanks are stuck on the opposite sides of a map having no chance to engage each other .
In case the engine is 50 % damaged it works at its half power .
The same refers to other modules and your crew — damaged tank radio will provide a reduced communication range , the loss of your gunner will lead to firing accuracy decrease .
We will add repair kits that can be used only once per battle in order to keep the proper game balance .
RPS : Just how many players can you have on a battlefield at any one time ?
Any problems with lag with high numbers ?
( And how big are the battlefields ? )
Zhyvets :
At the moment , the number of players in a team is limited to 15 and will be increased to 30 .
Thus , up to 60 panzers can clash in tense fights on the World of Tanks battlefields .
The size of a standard map is 1 square kilometer .
Maps ’ size is specified by technical and gameplay demands .
However , a desert map with lack of huge objects on it may be much larger and we will definitely add such locations into our game .
We had no serious lags so far .
The closed beta we held in Russia helped us reveal some bugs and errors that will be removed by the start of the European beta .
RPS : Can you explain a bit about how the global war part of the game will work ?
What would an RPS clan get out of playing together in that mode ?
Zhyvets :
To make a long story short , let ’s imagine a global map with persistent world divided into hundreds of provinces .
At the very beginning , we will start from the eastern boards of Germany to Volga and from Scandinavian countries to Romania .
There are several economic categories of provinces , from basic ones to “ capitals ” that will give most monetary benefits to their owners .
Once per day clan masters declare attacks on neutral or enemy provinces and a corresponding number of battles are scheduled and take place accordingly .
The bigger your clan is , the harder it gets to repel attacks and expand your empire .
Clans can sign treaties , non-aggression pacts or become vassals .
Having a couple of solid alliances will help protect the clan ’s flanks and rear .
But we also expect a lot of treachery , changing alliances , double - agents , stubbing in the back and other political tricks .
New clans enter the map by having a chance to fight a battle for one of the “ coastal ” provinces .
If they kick the owner out , that province will be their new home , from where they will expand deeper into the continent .
The more panzers you have , the more powerful your clan is , but in order to start fighting and capturing the provinces you should gather a team of 15 players .
Clans can also participate in clan tournaments that will last for much shorter time : from a couple of hours to a couple of days .
I ’m fairly sure that RPS clans will have some hilarious time in World Tanks clan wars .
Just interesting to see how good they are at diplomacy and tactics against hundreds of other guilds fighting for global domination .
RPS : So fun and games , but how much real history is in there ?
Zhyvets :
We have no story - driven missions .
But we definitely will introduce historic campaigns — series of battles set up on the maps close to their historical prototypes where only specific models of tanks will be allowed .
Historic Campaigns have the same mechanics as in Clan Wars , however , they will have less diplomacy and building options .
Holding such events on the regular basis , we will give players a chance to recreate the history of WWII and we are looking forward to seeing how they ’ll deal with that .
RPS : I understand the game is free , but with micropayments ?
What sort of stuff will players be asked to pay for ?
Zhyvets : World of Tanks is based on the free - to - play model .
Download the client , install it and join tense online warfare straight away .
We believe that the majority of players will be getting tons of fun from World of Tanks without investing a penny into the project and we are calm about it .
The leveling - up does n’t take ages and lasts extremely fast comparing to other MMO projects .
However , the player will have an opportunity to invest money into some bonus content .
First , this is a premium account , which gives +50 % to credits and experience per battle to the owner .
The premium account is a very comfortable option for players who do n’t have enough time for their favorite game , therefore , it will give them a chance to progress faster .
However , this account will not give you any advantages in battles .
The only advantage here is your saved time .
Second , players will also be able to purchase premium tanks .
We are very cautious about the game balance and will prevent “ war of wallets ” .
That ’s why we are not offering top - level tanks as premiums .
These are some special tanks with prominent history like Churchill or Matilda in the Russian tech tree or Lowe for Germany .
These panzers will be jewels in the crown of any tank lover ’s collection .
And finally , we will offer our players to use some custom features for their pets like personal drawings , insignias , clan emblems or custom camos .
RPS : Thanks for your time .
Expect a beta this summer , with the full launch to follow by the Autumn .
TARRYTOWN , N.Y . -
The mother of Army private Elizabeth Lynch - Gonzalez , who jumped from the Tappan Zee Bridge early Thursday , said her daughter was upset that her deployment to a Texas military base had been moved up to Thursday .
The mother said her daughter , who was 19 and 2009 graduate of Lakeland High School , was greatly upset when she found out Wednesday that her deployment order for Fort Hood had been moved up to Thursday .
The comments of the mother , Mary Ellen Lynch , came moments before police confirmed that a body found in the Hudson River a few miles south of the bridge was her daughter's .
The body washed ashore in Dobbs Ferry shortly after noon , 10 hours after the young woman jumped from the middle of the Tappan Zee Bridge .
Lynch - Gonzalez , who turned 19 in May , parked her car on the Rockland - bound side of the bridge about 2:30 a.m. , climbed over the railings , and jumped .
A construction worker on the bridge who saw what happened called authorities .
State police at Tarrytown called out marine units and fire department boats and divers from both sides of the Hudson River in a search for the victim .
By sun up , the search had become a recovery effort , police said .
" This is a tragedy , " said Jim Van Develde , communications director for the Lakeland Central School District .
" People here are reacting with a great deal of sadness . "
Members of the district 's crisis intervention team offered providing counseling to students and teachers .
Lynch - Gonzalez received her Army basic training at Fort Leonard Wood , Mo .
The young woman was the second military member this year to jump from the bridge .
In March , the body of Wolf Aristilde , 22 , of Spring Valley was found on the banks of the Hudson near Yonkers after he apparently plunged from the Tappan Zee on Jan .
3 .
Aristilde was an Army reservist with the 325 Military Intelligence Battalion in the Bronx and had been scheduled to be deployed to Iraq this month .
Lady Gaga ’s Alejandro video caused quite a stir with the blasphemous nature of its imagery .
Many people are , however , still wondering :
What is the meaning of the song and what message is the video trying to convey ?
This article examines the occult symbols used in Alejandro in order to understand its underlying message .
So , by a show of hands , who envisioned gay N - - i soldiers being raped by Lady Gaga while first listening to Alejandro ?
Okay , counting … one person .
One sick , disturbed person .
But seriously , art does n’t have to be literal and Lady Gaga ’s latest video surely is n’t .
As was the case with Bad Romance and Telephone , the video for Alejandro adds another layer of interpretation to the song by giving the words a deeper meaning .
Taking place in a cold , Orwellian , militaristic setting , the visuals of the video sharply contrast with the “ summer - y ” Latin beat of the song .
Other opposing concepts collide and blend in the video as well : good vs. evil , male vs. female and domination vs. submission .
The religious symbolism , in addition to adding the “ shock factor ” necessary to get people talking , gives the song a definite spiritual connotation .
The video for Alejandro is very symbolic and leaves it open for multiple interpretations .
For instance , I ’ve read an interpretation of the video claiming that it portrays the Catholic church ’s repression of the gay community .
This interpretation might have some validity to it , but it ignores many important aspects of the video .
Other observers seem to believe that all videos with religious imagery are “ tributes to Madonna . ”
Yes , Madonna did Like a Prayer , but this does n’t explain anything in Gaga ’s video .
In addition to a possible tribute , the symbolism of the video tells a story of spiritual rejection and metamorphosis taking place in the context of an oppressive police state .
The trend of incorporating militaristic and oppressive imagery in recent music videos has been discussed in some previous articles on Vigilant Citizen .
The video was directed by Steven Klein , a well - established photographer in the fashion industry .
He has worked with Calvin Klein , Alexander McQueen , Madonna , Nike and many others .
His photographic style often exploits the theme of homoeroticism and he obviously carried that theme into this video format .
We will attempt to decode the symbolism of the video and how it relates in today ’s context .
Spiritual Transformation
The most prevalent theme in the song is rejection .
The introduction of the song establishes this concept right away :
“ I know that we are young .
And I know you may love me .
But I just ca n’t be with you like this anymore ,
Alejandro . ”
The video starts with a funeral procession .
Gaga wears a black veil and holds the Sacred Heart , the bleeding heart of God for humanity .
Something is dead inside of Gaga and it seems to be her love for Alejandro .
But who is Alejandro ?
A gay guy she can not be with ?
A man she is cheating on with Roberto and Fernando ?
All possibilities , the song is not quite clear about that .
The imagery of the video , however , tells the viewers that Alejandro might stand for something deeper .
In a later scene , Gaga is shown laying down , wearing a red latex nun suit and holding a rosary .
Looking at the sky she says : “ Stop , please , just let me go . ”
Then , just when she says “ Alejandro , ” she raises her hands to the sky .
In this context , it is safe to say that Alejandro might very well be God .
“ She hides true love
En su bolsillo .
She ’s got a halo ’round her finger ,
Around you . ”
The halo around the finger is a wedding ring and Alejandro has a halo around him , which signifies he is considered “ holy . ”
The wedding ring represents Gaga ’s union with God through religion , but she is now ashamed of this marriage .
She hides the ring in her bolsillo , the Spanish word for pocket .
Why does she refer to a Fernando and a Roberto at some point ?
Is she referring to the triple aspect of God , the Holy Trinity ?
The concept of rejection is thus applied to God as he does not seem to satisfy Gaga ’s spiritual needs .
She then decides to seek godhood herself by embracing a new type of spirituality .
It seems to me the nun becomes a Luciferian priestess .
Inverted Cross
Gaga ’s robe contains many inverted crosses .
This is extremely significant in symbolic language .
The cross is a symbol of the Christian faith as it represents Jesus Christ ’s sacrifice and resurrection .
In Christianity , the inverted cross is known as the “ Cross of St. Peter ” , in honor of Simon Peter who requested to be crucified upside down because he felt unworthy to be put to death in the same matter as Christ .
In non-Christian circles , however , the inversion of the cross represents the perversion and desecration of what it symbolizes .
For this reason , inverted symbols are found in black magic and satanism .
“ In symbolism , an inverted figure always signifies a perverted power ( …) Black magic is not a fundamental art ; it is the misuse of an art .
Therefore it has no symbols of its own .
It merely takes the emblematic figures of white magic , and by inverting and reversing them signifies that it is left - handed . ” – Manly P. Hall , Secret Teachings of All Ages
The inverted cross , placed on Gaga ’s crotch , becomes a phallic symbol .
Superimposed and combined with her female genitals , the theme of androgyny becomes prevalent .
In occult circles , the alchemical transformation of the spiritual matter , the Great Work , must unite both opposing energies .
Becoming a God
The rosary is a set of beads used in Catholic tradition for prayer and meditation .
By swallowing the rosary , Gaga incorporates within her a symbol of religious devotion because 1 ) it is shocking and would get media attention 2 ) represents Gaga seeking to obtain godhood by her own means .
We have here a symbolic representation of the tenets of Luciferianism , which is the drive to attain divinity by one own means .
Lucifer is considered to be the active principle towards godhood , the one who brought “ divine light ” to the humans .
In another scene , Gaga is shown giving the sign of benediction and blessing , a gesture reserved in Catholicism to those who are considered Holy .
Later in the video , Gaga is violently pushed around and abused by the dancers surrounding her .
She surrenders and removes her robe for sexual , ritual initiation .
At the ending of the video , Gaga is consumed from within and her “ inner light ” comes out , representing her transformation from the physical to the spiritual plane .
Gaga ’s performance at American Idol truly exploited the Luciferian theme of the song .
The performance takes place in a setting reminiscent to the Garden of Eden , where the “ Fallen Angel ” –Lucifer , the one who was banished from Heaven and tempted Adam and Eve with divine knowledge–presides over the ceremony .
Fire comes out of the angel ’s wings ( after all , he is the “ Light Bringer ” ) each time Gaga says “ Alejandro . ”
At the end of the performance , Gaga is lifted up under the Fallen Angel as a blood - red liquid oozes out from the fountain underneath him .
Another ritual sacrifice has taken place on prime - time television .
Police State Imagery
Gaga ’s spiritual transformation is taking place in a dark , oppressive and militaristic backdrop .
This trend in music videos has been discussed in The Transhumanist and Police State Agenda in Pop Music .
The article describes how the public is currently being bombarded with militaristic and oppressive imagery , intertwined with sexuality , in order to desensitize the public and create a subconscious positive association .
Alejandro is clearly a continuation of this agenda set by the rest of the industry .
During the entire video , we see in the background a giant screen displaying scenes of social unrest , buildings on fire and military police running around , placing the viewers in a tense and oppressive ambiance .
The video opens with men marching to a militaristic rhythm , some of them having their heads covered , maybe hinting that those men are prisoners of some sort .
One of the men is inside a pyramidal shape while another holds a hexagram as the prisoners march .
Is this a representation of the masses marching to the rhythm of the elite , holding up high the symbols of its own oppression ?
Gaga is then shown in a position of power , wearing a black , illuminated crown while looking over the prisoners performing for her .
The “ Black Queen ” removes one goggle at a time , flashing the Illuminati All - Seeing Eye sign ( discussed in many previous articles on this site ) and revealing the true nature of her power .
In this scene , Gaga wears a “ gun bra , ” in accordance with the agenda of the sexualization of oppressive imagery .
Her backup dancers are dressed in uniforms reminiscent of dictatorships of the era of Hitler , Stalin , Franco , and Mussolini .
Political oppression is indeed sexy … oh wait , no , it ’s not … it actually goes against everything America supposedly stands for .
Mind Controlled Slaves ?
In a symbolic scene , a soldier is shown attached to strings , like a marionette .
He is not in control of his own movements and holds a gun on his privates ( more sexualization of weaponry ) .
He stares blankly , looking confused as a mind - control slave would .
In what looks like an internment camp , Gaga has the gay men bound to a bed as she rapes them , in what looks like a reenactment of ritual abuse .
In the final scene of the video , Gaga is shown attached to strings .
Is she herself controlled into perpetuating this agenda ?
In Conclusion
As stated above , the video to Alejandro is very complex and symbolic , and lends itself to multiple interpretations , depending on the viewer ’s knowledge and point of view .
There are , however , parts of the video in which the symbolism is clear and concise , leaving little doubt regarding the message being communicated .
During the video , Gaga goes through a very profound metamorphosis , rejecting Christian faith by desecrating its symbols and embracing a new type of spirituality .
Is Gaga ’s transformation a representation of the transformation that is currently happening on a worldwide scale ?
Are members of the elite , who were thought to be part of “ regular ” religions , revealing their true , Luciferian selves to the public ?
Will the New World Order leave traditional religions in the dust to embrace a new type of spirituality ?
Whatever the case may be , pivotal videos such as this one disseminate into the collective unconscious a specific set of symbols and values that will become , in time , “ part of our culture . ”
In order to achieve this , charismatic figures that are admired by the public are used make those messages cool and trendy .
Music fans have been subjected to an intense creative drought in the past years , which caused them to be desperate for a new , eccentric and iconic presence .
So Lady Gaga comes into the picture , slightly distances herself from the painfully formulaic music acts and is heralded as the new pop princess .
She also brings with her all of the Illuminati agenda and flashes in her fans faces the symbols of their own oppression .
I ’m sure many fans have a gut feeling that something is wrong with her act , but still ca n’t stop listening to her .
They must tell themselves , “ well , there is nothing else to listen to . ”
And that ’s what media monopolies are all about .
The Metro UK web site published a copy of the game 's original box .
Look familiar ?
The only things missing are artistic renderings of dead pelicans and oil billowing out of the ocean floor .
The article says the game allowed four players acting as " would - be tycoons " to compete for oil , " building platforms and laying pipelines to their home countries . "
Apparently not many of the BP games sold .
Oh , really ?
I can't imagine why .
Who would n't want to " lay pipe " instead of play Battleship , Risk , or even The Game of Life ?
Speaking of the game of life ...
In what may be the most ironic part of the story , " Offshore Oil Strike " reportedly included " hazard cards " , like one which says " Blow - out !
Rig damaged .
Oil slick clean - up costs .
Pay $ 1 million . "
The world worked together to help bring apartheid to an end , writes Kader Asmal .
So why allow it to live on in Israel / Palestine ?
In 1980 , I served on a commission of enquiry into reported violations of international law by Israel following its invasion of Lebanon .
We spent 22 days in Lebanon , Israel and the surrounding areas .
The devastation in Lebanon was quite overwhelming .
Bombings were carried on while we were there ; whole new blocks of flats in Beirut were destroyed simply because they were there .
The noise , the dust and the sound of bullets were ceaseless .
And then , after our preliminary work had been done , there were the Sabra and Shatila massacres of hundreds of defenceless refugees , shot dead by the Israeli surrogates , the Phalange .
The Palestine Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) had been expelled from Lebanon .
Golda Meir had said coldly that there was no such thing as a Palestinian .
Now the visible signs of such people had to be destroyed , as with the famous Palestine Library in Beirut and the hospital records in the West Bank .
Israel Shahack , head of an Israeli civil - liberties body , drew my attention to the similarities between Israel and apartheid South Africa : “ You see , ” he said , “ the West Bank and Gaza are our bantustans , reserves of labour for Israel but no freedom of labour . ”
The Palestinians have been betrayed by those who believe in the legal system that holds the world together and they have been betrayed by their neighbours , who bought peace from Israel .
The European Union grants Israel the enormous advantage of preferential trading status through the EU - Israel Association Agreement , and billions of American dollars in “ aid ” allows Israel to have the most technologically advanced army and counter - intelligence agency in the world .
It is time to delegitimise this entity .
We did that to the apartheid government in South Africa , and the same must happen to Israel .
We spent years trying to isolate South Africa , and the campaign grew to embrace a worldwide call for state - ordained boycotts , including military , economic , sporting , academic and cultural sanctions .
These campaigns stirred the conscience of the world .
Today , in Israel , non-Jewish nationals have no right to return .
Non-Jews are severely restricted in owning land in Israel and in the occupied territories .
There is no freedom of movement for Palestinians , who can also lose their residence rights for the slightest reason .
There is no right to assembly without the permission of the police .
Israel , as the occupying power , has appropriated nearly 30 % of the West Bank and destroyed the cohesiveness of East Jerusalem by building Israeli homes .
Every tenet of freedom and equality is violated by Israel , not only in the occupied territories but also in relation to their attitude to Palestine .
Today the West Bank and East Jerusalem are home to nearly half a million Israeli settlers who are subject to Israeli and not Palestinian law .
Special “ Israeli- only ” roads join these settlements together and to Israel .
There are more than 600 checkpoints in the West Bank , where Palestinians need identity cards to travel from one village to another .
Israel has imposed a matrix of controls that surpasses the restrictions once imposed by South Africa ’s apartheid regime on the black population .
With the construction of its “ apartheid wall ” , deemed illegal by the International Court of Justice ( ICC ) in 2004 , Israel has not just annexed a further 10 % of Palestinian land but has divided the West Bank into increasingly watertight ghettoes .
A look at a map of the West Bank reveals that , in reality , it is now part of greater Israel .
There are two classes of people living in this territory : Jews who have rights and privileges and non-Jews who have neither .
This is apartheid , and has been identified as such by former American president Jimmy Carter , among others .
Given that the world worked together to help bring apartheid to an end , why allow its persistence in Israel / Palestine ?
The United States perceives Israel as a strategic ally .
Furthermore , the Israeli lobby is by far the most powerful on Capitol Hill .
The EU is paralysed by the genocide committed against Europe ’s Jews in the 1940s .
This turns the Palestinians into scapegoats for Europe ’s past crimes , while equating the Israeli state with the Jewish people , many of whom worldwide passionately oppose its policies .
With no external pressure to conclude a peace agreement with the Palestinians , domestic pressure in Israel for peace has become muted .
Israel will not voluntarily relinquish control of the Palestinian territories , extend equal rights to Palestinian citizens of Israel , or negotiate a just resolution to all outstanding issues if there are no negative consequences for maintaining the status quo .
Whenever an opportunity for negotiation arises , Israel derails it with a provocative act .
In December 2008 and January 2009 , the Israeli military onslaught on Gaza , named Operation Cast Lead , left 1 400 Palestinians civilians dead , including 116 women and 313 children .
At no time in the history of apartheid did the racists use tactics such as those used by the Israelis : aerial strafing of built - up areas ; tanks and cannon against houses ; the destruction of water and sanitation works
In addition to the fatalities and injuries , tens of thousands of Palestinians were left homeless .
Israel tightened the illegal blockade on Gaza in place since June 2007 , preventing assistance being rendered to casualties and the importation of materials to rebuild Gaza .
Nearly 20 000 Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza are in Israel ’s prisons .
In April 2009 the United Nations Human Rights Commission established an independent international fact - finding mission to investigate violations of international human - rights and humanitarian law during Operation Cast Lead .
It was led by Richard Goldstone , a former member of the South African Constitutional Court and chief prosecutor with the international criminal tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia .
In September 2009 the Goldstone Report was released .
It accused both the Israeli Defence Force and Palestinian militants of war crimes and possible crimes against humanity .
It recommended that Israel and Hamas carry out independent , credible investigations , and that the allegations be brought to the ICC if they did n’t .
The Israeli government rejected the report ’s findings ; Hamas first rejected and then embraced it .
The most damning of the report ’s findings is paragraph 1886 of its conclusions :
“ The Mission recognises that not all deaths constitute violations of international humanitarian law .
The principle of proportionality acknowledges that , under certain strict conditions , actions resulting in the loss of civilian life may not be unlawful .
What makes the application and assessment of proportionality difficult in respect of many of the events investigated by the Mission is that deeds by the Israeli armed forces and words of military and political leaders prior to and during the operations indicate that , as a whole , they were premised on a deliberate policy of disproportionate force aimed not at the enemy but at the ‘ supporting infrastructure ’ .
In practice , this appears to have meant the civilian population . ”
In October 2009 the UN General Assembly endorsed Goldstone ’s findings , as did the EU Parliament on March 10 2010 — and on March 22 the EU Foreign Affairs Council voted to enhance the EU / Israel Association agreement , providing Israel with even more favourable trading conditions !
It would appear that if there is a contest in EU policy between human rights and economic benefit , human rights come off worse .
Yet the EU recently cancelled a trade agreement with Sri Lanka on human - rights grounds .
The only logical conclusion is that Israel has impunity because of Europe ’s past crimes .
The moral question remains :
Why must the Palestinian people pay with their lives and freedom to ease the consciences of Europeans ?
Now we must engage in a “ legitimacy war ” .
Doubt must be cast on several dimensions of Israel ’s legitimacy , its status as a moral and law - abiding actor , as an occupying power , and with respect to its willingness to respect the UN and abide by international law .
No more impunity .
Israel ’s leaders must be held to account .
The Goldstone report lends weight to calls from around the world to disrupt normal relations with Israel : by boycotting cultural and academic activities , by disrupting trade relations through disinvestment , or by refusing to load and unload ships and planes carrying cargo to or from Israel , and by pressing governments to impose economic sanctions .
It is up to all of us dedicated to peace and justice to do all we can to help the Palestinians prevail in the legitimacy war and bring their long ordeal to an end .

Enabling & Support Astronaut 's eye view : Mars Express orbiting the Red Planet
02/06/2010 2451 views 5 likes
This video shows what future astronauts would see from their cockpit : Mars turning below as they sweep around the Red Planet .
Last month , ESA 's Mars Express snapped images every minute to create a unique video that loops through a complete orbit of Earth 's gorgeous neighbour .
Mars holds a special fascination for humans .
Its relative proximity and its solid surface make it a tantalising target for exploration .
Thanks to this new video from Mars Express , we can now imagine what it will be like to orbit the Red Planet some day , possibly searching for a place to land .
Last month , mission controllers commanded the Visual Monitoring Camera ( VMC ) to acquire an image of Mars every minute during one complete , 7 - hour orbit .
The VMC is a low - resolution , non-scientific digital camera originally used only to confirm separation of the Mars Express lander in 2003 .
The resulting still images have been combined to create a unique video as Mars Express loops between its greatest height above the surface , 10 527 km , to its lowest , at just 358 km , and back again .
This is the first such video ever generated from a spacecraft orbiting Mars .
A constellation of giant volcanoes
The giant volcanoes of Mars can be clearly seen at the start of the video , visible as a constellation of dark spots on the desert surface .
They are followed by a glimpse of the Argyre Planitia , lying just north of the southern polar circle , before the spacecraft plunges into the darkness of the planet 's night side .
Daylight returns with a soaring ride over the spiral ices of the North Pole .
Near the beginning and end of the video , as Mars Express slows down during the highest arc of its orbit , Mars can be seen rotating on its axis .
At the very end , Phobos passes far beneath Mars Express , and the tiny moon 's disc can be seen as a dark circle moving from top to bottom in the movie .
The video clearly illustrates the highly elliptical orbit of Mars Express , with the journey around the planet starting slowly at high altitude and gaining speed as the altitude lowers .
It also shows how Phobos orbits Mars as well as numerous geographic features on the surface .
The fact that the viewer enters darkness on the night side and comes back out on the morning side ( and can see surface features rotating into the light ) also shows how night and day are created by a planet 's rotation , just like our own dusk and dawn on Earth .
Seven - hour orbit and 600 raw images
The images used to generate the video , 600 in total , were acquired during the 8194th orbit on 27 May 2010 between 02:00 and 09:00 UTC ( 03:00 - 10:00 CEST ) and were transmitted to Earth a few hours later via ESA 's 35 m - diameter New Norcia deep space antenna in Australia .
This unique video was produced through a cooperative effort between the scientists and mission controllers who care for Mars Express during its regular daily scientific exploration activities .

More information on the VMC , additional versions of this video and an archive of past images are available in the VMC - the Mars Webcam dedicated website .
Energy bill and carbon footprint are becoming increasingly important topics for commercial buildings .
This trend started with large buildings but nowadays also small and medium size buildings occupants and owners are eager to reduce their energy bill and carbon footprint … and to show it to all their stakeholders .
Devices and solutions providers are developing new features and new offers to enable that efficient management of the various energies , so that facility managers both for new and existing buildings can contribute to a sustainable development : meters , wireless communication systems , etc .
But the most dramatic change will come from the way the occupant and facility manager interact with that energy management systems to make it an actual tool for them to make things happen , in his specific situation .
In other words , standard energy dashboards and reports implemented once and for all do n’t meet the ever changing energy efficiency requirements !
That ’s where the new IT technologies come into play and where consumer technologies join business technologies : iGoogle , smart phones and tablets such as iPAD .
Tomorrow the more advanced energy management systems will leverage those technologies and thus allow the occupant and the facility manager to tailor himself the energy dashboards to his very specific need :
he will have access to an application store where he will be able to download the specific application widget , but only when he needs it : cost allocation , energy bill analysis …..
in a few mouse clicks he will be able to set a new energy dashboard : display a specific usage meter because some specific issue triggers that need now
he will easily select the energy dashboards he wants to display for exemple in his iGoogle page , along with his other key widgets
each individual user will be able to have his specific energy dashboards : no need to navigate in a complex hierarchy designed to cover all users needs
But technology is nothing if the user is not proactive .
Their challenge is to take the ownership of those possibilities and to adapt their energy dashboards to the changes in their organization , in the regulations , in their building processes , ….
Are buildings occupants and facility managers ready for that change ?
Laurent Bloch
Roy Ashburn was smitten by politics as a kid on the Central Coast .
At 12 , he was pedaling his bike to Ronald Reagan ’s gubernatorial campaign headquarters in San Luis Obispo , hanging out and helping out .
He would grow up to be a Kern County supervisor for a dozen years , then an Assembly member and a state senator for another 14 years , representing some of the most conservative turf in California and casting some of the most conservative votes in the Legislature .
Ashburn will be termed out come December , but his life as a “ family values ” politician all but ended months ago , in the early morning hours of March 3 .
He was arrested for DUI after he ’d left a gay club , and soon thereafter acknowledged that he was gay .
His DUI cost him his driver ’s license for a time and put him back on a bike , pedaling his life in an altogether new direction .
How different has your life been since your arrest ?
Totally and completely .
Obviously I stopped drinking .
All of my normal routines were stopped because of no driver ’s license , no car , the penalties that are proper for my offense , and I ’m going through those step by step , but I guess the bigger change is within me , and that ’s one that I ’m learning as I go .
For decades you worked so hard to keep your sexual orientation under wraps .
This must have been a torment , but in another sense , was there an element of relief ?
I ’m sensing relief now .
I had not consciously decided to come out , but there ’s no doubt looking back that I had become increasingly bold about attending gay events , like pride festivals , and going to dance clubs and bars .
Last year I attended Las Vegas Pride and San Diego Pride .
Were you looking over your shoulder ?
A little more in San Diego than Las Vegas .
You ’ve been obsessed with politics since you were 8 .
I asked my mother to take me to San Luis Obispo to watch Richard Nixon on the back of a train as he campaigned for governor , doing what they called a whistle - stop tour .
I can remember vividly being in that crowd at the train station and seeing Nixon deliver a speech .
And when you were 12 , you dragged your parents to register to vote for Ronald Reagan ?
I watched the 1964 [ Reagan ] speech about why [ Barry Goldwater ] should be elected .
I was totally captivated , so in 1966 , when Reagan decided to run for governor , I asked Dad and Mom to go with me to San Luis Obispo to register as Republicans to vote for Reagan , in the campaign office there next to the mission .
I used to pedal my bike to the campaign office after school [ to work ] for Ronald Reagan .
He came to San Luis Obispo ; the organizers of the rally asked me to be at the foot of the steps of the bus when he stepped off .
I have a picture ; it was in the newspaper .
It was electrifying .
Why Republicans ?
I never was interested in being a Democrat .
I watched the Democrat conventions — in those days they were actually somewhat meaningful , and remember , they were gavel to gavel , play by play of what was going on in the convention hall .
I watched all of the conventions , but from the very beginning , it was always Republicans .
At some point , you must have realized a public career was incompatible with being open about your sexual preferences .
Something happened that I guess caused me to realize that .
When I was in sixth grade , the police had a raid in the sand dunes [ near San Luis Obispo ] and a bunch of gay men were arrested , probably charged with indecent activity .
That sticks in my mind — the publicity and the shame around it .
One of my teachers was one of the people .
The talk among the kids , the talk among the adults , the talk in the community , the press — at that time the choice was pretty clear :
If you were gay and open , it was a life of shame , ridicule , innuendo about molesting and perversion .
It was a dark life .
Given that choice of whether you come out or whether you ’re in secret , I mean , there really was n’t a choice .
You worked for members of Congress , then were elected to public office yourself from Kern County .
Were your sexual preferences in the back of your mind , or did you just go about your business ?
The answer is both yes and no .
I was married and had children .
And I had a career and a passion .
I also had a huge secret .
But given my circumstances and my responsibilities , it was n’t an overwhelming issue for me .
The desires were always there , but my focus was primarily on — well , pretty selfishly — on me and my career and my family .
Barry Goldwater had a gay grandson and did n’t think government had any business in anybody ’s bedroom .
But the recent brand of Republicanism has championed anti-gay issues .
I truly believe the conservative philosophy as embraced by Goldwater : that the government has no role in the private lives of the citizens .
In the 1980s , there was a coming together of the religious right and the Goldwater right , sort of a marriage of convenience .
It propelled Ronald Reagan to the presidency .
Reagan never repudiated that but — this is just my view — I do n’t think he really embraced it either .
In no way do I want to put down people of strong religious convictions ; I happen to have very strong religious beliefs myself .
But it was a merger of those two , and the religious [ right ’s issues ] were about same - sex rules , same - sex marriage , abortion , gun rights , these sort of core , litmus - test issues .
Did you feel uneasy with that combination ?
You did help to organize and speak at a rally in 2005 against a legislative bill sanctioning same - sex marriage .
How I ever got into that is beyond me .
I was very uncomfortable with that , and I told one of my confidantes , “ I ’m never doing that again . ”
It was not what I wanted to do , it was n’t me , but I helped to organize and lent my name .
A lot of people , gay or straight , are probably wondering why you voted even against issues like insurance coverage for same - sex partners .
The best I can do is to say that I was hiding .
I was so in terror I could not allow any attention to come my way .
So any measure that had to do with the subject of sexual orientation was an automatic “ no ” vote .
I was paralyzed by this fear , and so I voted without even looking at the content .
The purpose of government is to protect the rights of people under the law , regardless of our skin color , national origin , our height , our weight , our sexual orientation .
This is a nation predicated on the belief that there is no discrimination on those characteristics , and so my vote denied people equal treatment , and I ’m truly sorry for that .
When it comes to marriage , I ’m getting the feeling that you ’re mulling over whether government ought to be in the marriage license business at all .
It ’s a very complicated issue , marriage , but it seems to me that the government ’s role is to protect a civil contract , whether it ’s to purchase a home together , enter into whatever financial or legal arrangement , including marriage .
The whole issue of marriage as a 5,000 - year - old tradition , a religious context , a historical context — what government ’s role is , is the sanctification of the legal bond .
Then it seems to me a matter for a church or some other societal organization but not for government .
What have you been talking about with the gay groups you ’ve been meeting with ?
The same things we ’re talking about .
I do n’t have an agenda .
I do n’t have a plan .
I do n’t have an expectation .
I just want people to know who I am and what ’s in my heart .
I kept that from people .
I concealed it from everyone for almost all my life , so I ’m [ now ] privileged to work with people from all aspects of life , including organizations devoted to advancing the rights of gay and lesbian and transgendered individuals .
Recently in the Senate you spoke in favor of a resolution calling on Congress to repeal “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell . ”
For that day I knew I had to say something .
I already had prepared what I was going to say about serving in the military , and I actually had it written out because I wanted to be precise .
But I had to preface it with something else , to give context to why all this time in elective office and being so deeply hidden , why was I now standing and speaking on this subject matter , and so I did .
You ’ll probably be regarded as a go - to spokesman for a lot of gay issues from here on out .
Are you OK with that ?
I ’m just trying to tell the truth from the reality of the life I ’ve lived , which has been an amazing life .
I have had the privilege of serving in elective office for 26 years and dealing with important legislation , and I did so with a huge secret and in many ways a career built upon lies and deceit .
Now that the truth is known , actually I am comfortable talking about these things .
What legislative accomplishment are you proudest of ?
It ’s multifaceted .
I ’m the author of the bill which created what we call CalWorks .
The Thompson - Maddy - Ducheny - Ashburn Welfare - to - Work Act of 1997 [ was about ] the proper role of government in trying to provide help to poor people .
Two million Californians are no longer on welfare .
Yours is a pretty conservative district .
What have you heard from constituents ?
My constituents are very understanding , remarkably accepting people .
Many are the descendants of Dust Bowl migrants , and they brought with them the values of that part of the country .
They also brought an openness and friendliness and work ethic .
These are wonderful people , and I shocked them .
I mean , I shocked them to the core with this revelation .
Understandably they would be upset , they would be angry , they would be disillusioned , disappointed .
The person they had supported and known and donated to — I was someone other than what I had always portrayed myself to be .
And even in the light of that , most people have been very kind to me .
You ’re divorced , with four daughters and grandchildren .
So here ’s where I ask about your family , and you can tell me to buzz off .
The things we ’re talking about were my choices .
It was my choice to keep it secret ; it was my choice to be a gay man and be married and have children .
It was my choice to build a life on lies in order to conceal myself .
That obviously had a big effect on my marriage and my children in ways that I do n’t fully comprehend , but it ’s my responsibility and not something to be talked about in interviews .
Fair enough .
What happens now ?
I like my [ Senate ] job very much .
I wish we did n’t have term limits , which is also another really bad Republican idea we ought to repeal .
I ’m doing the things necessary for me to fulfill my obligation for breaking the law .
I ’m in DUI classes ; I ’m coming to terms with my alcohol abuse .
At the same time , I do n’t know that I ’ve ever felt more optimistic about the future for myself .
I do n’t know what the future holds , but I think it ’s going to be incredible .

I love communicating with my readers .
Unfortunately , I do n’t get nearly as much time as I ’d like to do it .
Occasionally I have a conversation that I think will have value with other readers and I ask to share those discussions in a public forum .
This is one such conversation , dealing with the effects of viewing such things as child porn while performing one ’s duties as a forensic investigator .
I hope this help helps others , and as always – your feedback is appreciated in the comments below .
I read every comment !
Here ’s the e-mail chain from my monkey mailbox ( chiefmonkey AT gmail.com ) .
Enjoy !
Chief , I have a job interview , for a forensics firm , coming up next week .
I know its a good job educationally and financially , but I am worried about the material I will be exposed to .
The worst kind of porn .
Just a quick background .
I finished a 3 year diploma in information security and forensics 3 years ago .
After school I took a job with a small law firm in the area doing some security projects and systems administration .
The main reason I took the job is because the head of my program at college was working with the lawyer to start an information security company .
I was exited to work with my teacher , but in the end it did n’t take off .
Last year when the economy took a dive I was laid off .
I have been doing random jobs for the last 8 months while trying to find a serious job in the infosec field .
Last week a friend from college called me up and asked if I wanted to take a job at the forensics firm he was at .
I enjoyed the investigations at school and the few I did after I graduated ; so I agreed to an interview .
I then found out I would not be working with my college friend as I was interviewing to be his replacement , because he was having issues with the material he was seeing in his investigations .
This lead me to asking the question of how I would react .
Before finishing school I had wondered about this topic , because I was thinking about doing forensics for law enforcement , though I never come to an answer .
I want to do something in my life that makes a difference .
I would like to think doing investigations that help convect the guilt and protect the innocent would make it worth it , but I do n’t know .
So I seek your guidance Chief .
In the post Pr0n : The Subject That Keeps On Giving you wrote “ Once you are exposed to that material during an investigation , it haunts you for the rest of your life and may even affect your life in ways that you ’d never imagined .
You start being uncomfortable around young children , you start feeling guilty for no reason other than having to view that garbage during a forensic acquisition , and – well , you just become sad and angry ” .
With that in mind was it worth it for you ?
You have had an exiting career doing investigations and security , but would you trade all of it to have not seen some of the things you have seen on the journey ?
or has the good out weighted the bad ?
Does it ever stop haunting you ?
Thanks for taking the time to read about my concerns and for any advice you can give .
I know we all will react differentially to these things , but I want to go into it with a informed perspective .

My response :
Hi ,
To answer your three questions : Would you trade all of it to have not seen some of the things you have seen on the journey ?
I , like others in this field , certainly have days where we probably would trade it all to make it “ go away ” .
There is a vast spectrum of “ badness ” for this type of material from semi-harmless to mind - blowing evil .
To give you an idea of what that scale looks like – if I had to make a scale – it would look something like this ( 1 being harmless , 10 being OMG ) :
1 ) Crawling through financial records and tax statements .
* yawn *
2 ) Crawling through video surveillance .
This is time consuming and depending on what crime was committed can be quite disturbing .
3 ) Discovery of e-mails , deleted attachments , and IM logs .
You ’d be surprised ( and maybe scared ) at some of the things that people share when in front of a computer .
When they are discussing things like # 7 through # 10 below it gets even worse .
4 ) Finding breadcrumbs of people ’s posts in facebook , myspace , etc .
Most of it is just utter nuttery , but there are some people that like to brag about things they ’ve done which is disturbing to read if you have a vivid imagination .
5 ) Finding sophisticated tracking software on a victim ’s computer , and then tracking where the information went , and how it was used .
Cyber criminals are just as sick as pervs , except the exploitation revolves around financials and personally sensitive information like medical conditions , relationships , etc .
6 ) Child - looking adults that dress up like children for sexual adult videos / pictures .
These even fool medical doctors when testifying as to the age of the “ victim ” , which usually lands the perp in jail for child pr0n .
Unless the actress comes forward , or an investigator tracks them down – the perp is almost always jailed .
( Perfect example right here : http://www.pumpsmag.com/ ladies/lupe-fuente-saves-fan- trip -puerto-rico/ < – warning , the ads may be NSFW )
7 ) Violence against animals .
Tying animals to train tracks , microwaving , drowning , strangulating , shooting , stabbing … sadly this is mostly done by young teens and angry drunks .
8 ) Violence against women for the sake of being violent .
Tying them up , locking them in closets , burning them , rape , sodomy , “ sharing ” them with other perps , starving them to death – all videotaped or photographed .
9 ) Sexual exploitation of children , typically related to the perp in some way ( daughter , son , niece , nephew , grandchild ) .
10 ) Sexual violence against children ( from infants to teens ) in the worst possible ways .
Things you ’d never imagine , or inferred from TV , Movies , or Books .
Things that you ’re pretty sure only probably happened in truly evil people .
Would I trade it ?
Probably not .
I ’ve done some great work , and some not so great work .
But I ’m damn proud of the great work !
… or has the good out weighted the bad ?
To be honest , that thought is what kept me going for years and years .
A few years ago , I made a decision that I was at a point in my life and career where I honestly did n’t want to do it any longer and starting outsourcing that function .
I still make a few exceptions for boring things ( like financial investigations and favors to friends ) , but that ’s about it .
It ’s a sanity thing .
Does it ever stop haunting you ?
Computer forensics has taught me two important lessons in life :
1 ) There are evil , evil , evil people in this world .
You can be as optimistic as you like , and embrace Buddhist - like philosophies on the nature and meaning of life , but nothing will prepare you for what you will encounter .
You need to put an emotional shield up and focus on the mission at hand , and then try really hard to let it roll off your shoulders .
Take pride in the fact that you helped prosecute someone that broke the law , or that you helped free a person that was wrongly accused ( my favorite types of cases , all though somewhat rare ) .
2 ) That being said , do n’t forget that there are wonderful people in this world that try to do the right thing , try to make a difference , and try to make the world a better place .
For some of those people to accomplish their mission , they have to have very thick skin , and fuel themselves on the merits of their work .
While it may seem sometimes that the good people are outnumbered , I can tell you from my experience that it ’s the other way around .
The truly evil people are a small subset of the population , and should not cloud your vision of what humanity is .

An unidentified 17 - year old from Latrobe , Pennsylvania has been handed a sentence of 12 months probation , 250 hours of community service with an order to pay Sony Computer Entertainment $ 5,000 for his successful effort to crash the electronics and gaming titan ’s website in November of 2008 .
An investigation spearheaded by the FBI led authorities to the minor , who hacked into and crashed the site in an apparent response to being kicked off the PSN a number of times for cheating while playing SOCOM U.S. Navy Seals .
He reportedly used hacking tools to gain access to infected computers around the globe and ended up clogging a trio of games on the PlayStation site , causing it to go down .
Sony originally sought around $ 33,000 from the boy , but Judge John Driscoll ruled that the amount would be “ too excessive ” , citing that the teen “ seems to have accepted personal responsibility and agrees he should be held accountable . ”
[ Pittsburgh Tribune - Review ]
PRESIDENT
Obama has secretly sanctioned a huge increase in the number of US special forces carrying out search - and - destroy missions against al - Qaeda around the world , with American troops now operating in 75 countries , The Times reported .
The dramatic expansion in the use of special forces , which in their global span go far beyond the covert missions authorised by George W. Bush , reflects how aggressively the President is pursuing al - Qaeda behind his public rhetoric of global engagement and diplomacy .
When Mr Obama took office , US special forces were operating in fewer than 60 countries .
In the past 18 months he has ordered a big expansion in Yemen and the Horn of Africa - known areas of strong al - Qaeda activity - and elsewhere in the Middle East , central Asia and Africa .
According to The Washington Post , Mr Obama has also approved pre-emptive special forces strikes to disrupt terror plots , and has given the units powers and authority that was not granted by Mr Bush when he occupied the White House .
It also emerged yesterday that Robert Gates , the US Defense Secretary , has ordered the Pentagon to find savings of more than $ US100 billion over the next five years to redistribute more funds for combat forces - including special operations units .
Mr Gates has called on all departments to come up with proposals by July 31 , and is initially demanding $ 7 billion in cuts and efficiencies for the 2012 fiscal year , and further cuts each year up to 2016 .
The effort to provide more money for combat forces in Afghanistan and Iraq - including special operations units - is likely to lead to a clash with Congress , and also with the defense industry if favoured equipment programs are scrapped .
The aggressive secret war against al - Qaeda and other radical groups has coincided with a surge in the number of US drone attacks in the lawless border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan , an al Qaeda and Taliban haven , since Obama took office .

Updated on May 21 , 2019 : Please note : Cucumber kim chi is best refrigerated and enjoyed right after making it .
You can allow it to ferment before refrigerating as you would with cabbage kim chi , but because cucumbers tend to go soft a lot quicker than cabbage , it 's best to think of this dish as a crisp , refreshing salad / side dish .
Enjoy !
One of the joys of Korean cuisine is having a number of healthy and yummy side dishes to eat along with each main course .
Kim chi - fermented , spicy cabbage - is easily the most celebrated Korean side dish .
Few non-Koreans know that hundreds if not thousands of varieties of kim chi are made throughout Korea .
Makes perfect sense , of course , since you can make kim chi out of most varieties of vegetables .
Why should you consider eating kim chi now and again ?
It 's a tasty way to give your body a number of nutrients that come with raw vegetables , including those found in raw garlic .
Combine raw garlic , plenty of enzymes , and a long list of antioxidants with the probiotics that come with naturally fermented kim chi , and you have yourself a true superfood that provides a powerful strengthening effect on your immune system .
Here 's a look at how my mom makes cucumber kim chi , which has long been one of my favorite dishes ...
Start with about 15 to 20 small cucumbers , the kind that are used to make dill pickles .
If you can't find small cucumbers , you can use about the equivalent amount of large cucumbers .
Give the cucumbers a good rinse , then chop them into bite - size pieces .
Put them in a large bowl , add about two flat tablespoons of sea salt , and toss well .
Allow salted pickles to sit overnight at room temperature , or at least for a couple of hours .
The salt helps draw moisture out of the cucumbers , which creates a natural brine .
Now add 1 /2 to 1 full teaspoon of minced raw garlic .
We use raw minced garlic that we keep in a small container in the refrigerator .
Wash and chop up three green onions - not three bunches , but three individual ribs .
Not sure if they are called ribs ?
Cords ?
Hope this is clear .
Add chopped green onions to the mix .
Do n't you love seeing all this green ?
The green onions add texture and natural sweetness to this cucumber kim chi dish .
For a little extra sweetness , chop up 1 / 4 of a small to medium yellow onion .
And add it to the mix .
If you 're worried about the sharp bite that raw onions have , stop worrying right now .
Once given a day or two to naturally ferment , the onion loses most of its sharpness .
But it does n't lose any of its flavor , so unless you really have something against onions , go ahead and add some .
Now the part that makes any kim chi a real , authentic kim chi : add two flat tablespoons of fine red chili flakes .
I do n't know whether to call this red chili flakes or powder .
It 's not really a powder ... the flakes are really fine .
Koreans call it ko choo kah rhoo , which literally means ground hot peppers .
If at all possible , please get some of this stuff from a local Korean grocery store so that you can be sure that you have the right kind for making kim chi .
You can add ko choo kah rhoo to any number of dishes , of course , like miso soup and seasoned green beans .
Koreans add ko choo kah rhoo to just about everything .
Did I mention that ko choo kah rhoo is extremely rich in vitamin C ?
Now add a teaspoon of vinegar .
Next , put on a pair of gloves ( to protect your skin against the heat of the ko choo kah rhoo ) and give everything a good toss .
Here 's about what it should look like when you 're done tossing :
Oops , forgot to add a little extra hint of sweetness .
Just a tablespoon of honey will do , please .
You can actually add the honey before the first good toss ... we just forgot .
Here 's a good look at the glorious kim chi brine that is naturally created as you go through the steps in this recipe .
Once the kim chi cools down in the refrigerator , this brine is a real treat on hot days .
Just one spoonful after a meal makes you feel like everything is going to be okay .
Now pack your cucumber kim chi away into glass bottles , and do n't forget to add a bit of brine to each one - just a couple of tablespoons of brine per bottle will do .
Here 's a close - up just before we cap it and put this baby to rest for a day or two .
All that 's left to do at this point is to transfer the bottles to your refrigerator and enjoy small servings as you please .
Cucumber kim chi does n't typically keep as well as cabbage kim chi , so you can begin enjoying it right away , almost like a crisp , refreshing salad or side dish .
It 's best to eat up your batch within two to three days , though if kept refrigerated , it will keep for quite a bit longer , although it will lose its crunch by the day .
Dish some out , just like this , whenever you need a little kim chi to spice up a meal :
And the next time you make kim chi , feel free to be creative and try a different cut .
For example , instead of chopping the cucumbers up into rough chunks , you can slice them into thinner , longer strips , which look really nice with a bowl of noodles .
Here 's what I mean :

Quotable :
On Tuesday last week , customers at Deb ’s Books in Cullman , Ala . started coming in and calling with an odd request :
They wanted copies of “ The Road to Serfdom , ” a book economist Friedrich Hayek wrote over 65 years ago .
Customers at Schuler Books and Music , in Grand Rapids , Mich .
were also looking Hayek ’s book .
Same with the Book Shop in Green Valley , Ariz .
On Amazon , it shot to number one where it remained for a week .
The reason : Fox News television host Glenn Beck , whose recommendations have lately had an Oprah Winfrey - like effect on book sales , had just devoted a section of his show to the Road to Serfdom .
Hayek ’s
The Road to Serfdom remains the # 2 book at Amazon , topped only by Glenn Beck ’s own The Overton Window .
More from the article :
The Elkhart Public Library , in Elkhart , Ind. , has just one copy of the Road to Serfdom and nine holds on it for people waiting in line to read it .
It ’s ordered another one and would have ordered two , except that recent cuts in the library ’s funding mean that it ca n’t buy as many books in response to reader demand as it used to .
And a great quote from Don Boudreaux :

For the first time in the competition ’s history , the 2011 Six Nations Championship will start with a Friday evening fixture .
This departure from tradition has been driven by television paymasters hoping for bumper viewing figures for what is always one of the most eagerly anticipated fixtures of the tournament , Wales versus England .
France will kick off their defence of their Grand Slam with a tricky tier against a much improved Scotland , whilst Ireland will take flight to Rome .
The second week of matches will see Ireland welcome France to Dublin for the first Six Nations fixture at the rebuilt Lansdowne Road , now renamed the Aviva Stadium .
Many have criticised the IRFU for moving back to the site of their old ground after a number of years at the magnificent Croke Park , which holds 30,000 more supporters , but the income streams from the new stadium and the control of their own destiny made the move inevitable .
The Six Nations tournament will run its usual 7 week course with games being played on the first two weekends , a weekend off followed by a game with a rest week after it and a final set of back to back games .
This format will once again test the squad depths of the competing nations as well as making it an exciting spectacle for the fans .
The final weekend will see all six teams play in a ‘ Super Saturday ’ format .
The final game , which the organisers will be hoping will decide the championship will be Wales v France at Cardiff .

How to Buy Six Nations Rugby Tickets
Six Nations tickets are readily available for games at some stadia , especially Stade de France in Paris and Murrayfield in Scotland , but the majority of games are instant sell outs .
High price Six Nations tickets are usually available through secondary sellers , but there is a danger of forgery or fraud .
A number of Six Nations tickets are usually allocated to local rugby clubs affiliated to the home union and many distribute them to club members through a draw .
However , there is an increasing trend to raise revenue for the club by selling them on to Corporate hospitality companies or in exchange for sponsorship .
Philadelphia ’s nickname may be “ The City of Brotherly Love , ” but sports fans in that metropolis are notorious for a lack of fraternal affection : According to reputation , Philadelphia fans love a winner ( who does n’t ? ) but will mercilessly turn on any players or team that do n’t live up to expectations , no matter how brilliant their past performances .
No single image sums up that reputation more succinctly than the claim that fans in Philadelphia once booed and pelted with snowballs that most inoffensive , beloved , and benevolent of figures , Santa Claus himself .
The claim is true , although the potentially mitigating circumstances under which the incident occurred typically go unmentioned .
The infamous “ booing Santa Claus ” episode took place at old Franklin Field ( then the home field of the NFL’s Philadelphia Eagles franchise ) on 15 December 1968 , as the Eagles squared off against the Minnesota Vikings in their final game of the season .
The Eagles ’ record stood at a dismal 2 - 11 going into the game ( they ’d end the season 2 - 12 after losing to the Vikings that day ) ; even worse , Philadelphia had begun the year with a pathetic eleven straight losses , and two meaningless late season victories had served no purpose other than to take the Eagles out of the running for the # 1 pick in the upcoming NFL / AFL common draft .
( The 1 - 12 - 1 Buffalo Bills garnered the first pick and used it to select a USC running back named O.J. Simpson ; the Eagles went third and chose forgettable running back Leroy Keyes from Purdue . )
Adding to the disenchanting game environment that Sunday afternoon was the weather :
It had been snowing in Philadelphia since the night before , and by game time the temperature was in the low 20s , with a wind chill factor abetted by wind gusts of up to 30 miles per hour .
Arriving fans reportedly had to clear their seats of an accumulated three inches of slush and snow before sitting down .
Still , as noted in The Great Philadelphia Fan Book , the fact that over 54,000 people showed up to watch a miserable team play in miserable weather is a testament to the loyalty of Philadelphia fans .
The Eagles claimed an early 7 - 0 lead until , just before the end of the half , the Vikings capitalized on an interception and quickly tied the game with a 57 - yard touchdown pass .
But even if the football on the field was less than scintillating that day , at least fans in attendance were supposed to be treated to a decent Christmas Pageant at halftime :
While the Eaglette cheerleaders ( dressed up as elves ) romped on the field accompanied by a 50 - piece brass band playing Christmas tunes , Santa was to make his entrance riding around the field on a huge Christmas float featuring an “ ornate sleigh dragged by eight life - sized fiberglass reindeer . ”
Even before it had barely begun , however , the halftime show started to go as awry as the Eagles ’ season .
A day ’s worth of snow and the pounding cleats of large football players had turned much of the field to muck , and the float quickly got stuck in the mud , meaning Santa would have to abandon his traditional means of conveyance and parade around on foot instead .
But Santa was nowhere to be found , the person hired to portray him ( depending upon which report one believes ) having been prevented from making it to Franklin Field due to either an excess of inclement weather or an excess of alcoholic refreshments .
In a panic , the Eagles ’ entertainment director , Bill Mullen , approached a fan sitting in the stands , 20 - year - old Frank Olivo , to fill in for the absent Santa Claus .
Olivo , who had worn a red corduroy Santa suit and a fake beard to the game , was given a large sack and tapped to weave down the field between two columns of Eaglettes , waving to the crowd as the brass band played “ Here Comes Santa Claus . ”
Years later , Olivo recalled what happened next :
“ That ’s when the booing started .
At first , I was scared because it was so loud .
But then I figured , hey , it was just good - natured teasing .
I ’m a Philadelphia fan , I knew what was what .
I thought it was funny .
” When Olivo finished his run down Santa Claus Lane , he got into range .
A fan in the upper deck threw the first snowball .
As Santa hit the south end zone , one turned into ten , then into 100 .
“ When I hit the end zone , and the snowballs started , I was waving my finger at the crowd , saying ‘ You ’re not getting anything for Christmas , ' ” Olivo recalled .
“ Oh , I got pelted , ” Olivo says .
He remembers being hit by several dozen snowballs , which suggests that many of the upper - deck denizens were more accurate passers than [ the Eagles ’ quarterback ] .
“ I did n’t mind , ” he says .
“ I started kibitzing with some of the people throwing the snowballs . ”
Still , he had his limits .
“ When I finished , Mr. Mullen asked if I wanted to do it again the next year , ” Olivo says .
“ I told him , ‘ No way .
If it does n’t snow , they ’ll probably throw beer bottles . ”
What prompted the Philadelphia fans to treat Santa Claus so inhospitably that day remains a subject of contention .
Some , such as Jim Gallagher , the Eagles ’ public relations director at the time , claimed the bad behavior was prompted by Santa ’s pathetic physical appearance , recalling : “ He was the worst - looking Santa I ’d ever seen .
Bad suit , scraggly beard .
I ’m not sure whether he was drunk , but he appeared to be . ”
For his part , Olivo maintains that he was “ a terrific Santa ” ( if slightly undersize for the part at 5 ’ 6 ″ and 170 lbs. ) , that his suit was actually of quite good quality , that he was n’t drunk , and that “ a lot of [ people who claim otherwise ] were n’t even here . ”
Others opine that Santa was just a stand - in for the real ( and out - of - reach ) targets of the Philadelphia fans ’ frustration , the ownership and coaching that had transformed a championship football franchise into one of the league ’s worst teams ( and that the booing was initially directed at the Eagles players as they headed for the locker room at halftime ) .
One spectator present that day , himself later an NFL player and team president , explained the fans ’ temperament :
“ It was a miserable day and a miserable team , ” recalls [ Matt ] Millen , who was 11 years old at the time .
“ That was the only fun part of the game , and everybody joined in — fathers , sons , even the old ladies .
That guy had it coming .
I still remember the song , ‘ Here Comes Santa Claus ’ — BOOM !
Got ‘im !
Hey , it was just the thing to do at the time .
No big deal . ”
“ But it was different in that era , ” he adds .
“ Very passionate .
Franklin Field was a crazy place .
People took their football seriously .
Hell , they ’d run on the field to get at the players and coaches . ”
Millen is now president of the Detroit Lions .
How would he feel if fans threw snowballs at his stadium ?
“ Well , we play in a dome , ” he says .
“ So I guess they ’d have to smuggle them in . ”
For those who claim that Philadelphia ’s “ throwing snowballs at Santa ” tale is merely a myth that has been invented and grown in the telling across the decades , we note that the incident was prominent enough to garner mention in contemporaneous news accounts of the game :
[ Philadelphia ]
Inquirer columnist Frank Dolson worked it into his story , saying that Santa “ made his tour of the stadium , waving cheerfully in the best holiday tradition .
The fans responded , pelting him with snowballs , in the worst Philadelphia tradition . ”
The [ Philadelphia ]
Bulletin‘s Ray Kelly wrote , “ The fans even threw snowballs at Santa when he paraded around the field at halftime . ”
The entire incident might have been forgotten if late Sunday night the local news had not been followed by the “ ABC Weekend Report , ” a national news show featuring Howard Cosell with a weekly package of NFL highlights .
When the whip - around got to Franklin Field , Cosell showed no football .
Instead , he aired the pelting of Santa , accompanied by his polysyllabic verbiage shaming the Philadelphia faithful .
When the NBA ’s Philadelphia 76ers held a December 2003 promotion to set a record for the largest number of Santas at one gathering , in conjunction with a game against the Orlando Magic , Frank Olivo made an appearance in costume to reprise his role as Philadelphia ’s most ( in ) famous Santa Claus :

There ’s an implicit pressure on social media enthusiasts to be connected in more than one way .
It ’s not enough to have a Facebook page , you need a Twitter account as well .
What do you mean you ’re not on Linked In ?
Well , at least you have a blog on Wordpress or Tumblr , right ?
There is no requirement to spread your digital self thin , but many of us are still juggling more than one online profile ( I ’m currently balancing at least five ) .
Each of these profiles offers us a chance to connect with new communities in different ways , but each network needs to be managed and updated .
With so many online profiles , questions are bound to arise .
Is your bio page the same across all platforms ?
Should it be ?
There are few hard and fast rules when navigating social media ; a lot comes down to preference .
For those starting out or just looking to make sense of their profiles , we ’ve culled advice from five social media experts in a range of backgrounds .
Mashable ’s given you ways to create your brand , face the challenges , track your reputation , and corral your profiles on the social web .
Now , here are five ways to manage , consolidate , and clean up your online identity .
1. Keep it Consistent
One of the best things you can do is to make sure your profiles are consistent .
This includes your bio page , your profile pic , and your tone of voice .
“ Consistency is important , ” said Dan Schawbel , managing partner of Millennial Branding , “ If you ’re “ Matt ” on one site , you better be “ Matt ” on every other site . ”
That similarity can help viewers keep track of you across different platforms .
Start by scooping up vanity URLs on sites like Facebook ( facebook.com / ClarkKent ) and Twitter ( twitter.com / ClarkKent ) , and buying your domain name ( www.ClarkKent.com).
Similar fonts and font sizes can also help create a congruous online identity .
But what about your updates — how do you keep those consistent ?
“ Using the same tone of voice will help keep the cohesion , ” said Amber Naslund , Director of Community at Radian6 .
“ It does n’t have to be verbatim but there needs to be a certain level of consistency , ” Naslund said .
“ You ’re assuming that [ one particular social site ] might be the only place they get that [ information ] . ”
Keep in mind that consistency does n't mean repetition .
Customize your profiles and updates to align with the values and uses of each social platform , but maintain a common theme throughout .
2. Find Your Brand
Put some forethought into what your want your digital reputation to be and build towards that .
Joshua Benton , Director of Harvard ’s Nieman Journalism Lab , highlights the importance of viewership .
“ You do n’t want to have carbon copies because you ’re talking to different audiences .
Your paragraph bio on LinkedIn is n’t going to make sense on your Twitter page and neither of those is going to make sense on your Facebook page . ”
Benton recommends making a basic bio that can be tailored for each network .
“ Think about how the image you want to present sits in with the audience . ”
Different networks are better for different things — it helps to cater your posts based on the audience .
“ Part of that is baked into the form , ” Benton said .
“ It ’s sort of hard to have a wild and crazy Linked In profile , whereas you can on something like MySpace . ”
Whether you want to be known by your real name ( recommended ) or a cute buzzword , it ’s important to come up with something memorable and representative of you .
This advice applies to people and brands .
“ When you type Digsby , we are the first result , ” said Steve Shapiro , CEO of Digsby .
“ It is important to pick a unique product name but also one that people can spell when they hear it , or they ’ll never find you on Google . ”
Once you ’ve decided your online name and brand , try to stick with it .
It ’s hard to build a reputation if you keep changing .
“ The problem with changing your specialty every six months is that people can see what you did six month ’s prior , ” explained Barry Hurd , CEO and founder of 123SocialMedia .
That kind of indecision can make it difficult for your audience to get a grasp on your identity .
3. Own Your Name
One of the best ways to track your progress is a simple Google search .
“ I ’m conscious that I ’m writing about the things I ’d liked to be found for , ” Naslund said .
“ If I ’m going to post a tweet about a drunken bender with my sister from last night , it might pop up on Google . ”
Make sure you 're updating your social networks on news and events that you want to be known for .
Part of managing your online identity is understanding your professional profiles ( like Linked In ) can very well get mixed up with personal profiles ( like Facebook ) .
“ You ca n’t keep the peas from touching the mashed potatoes , " Naslund added .
" The Internet does n’t distinguish between profiles .
That ’s a human distinction , not a technical one .
It all gets lumped into the same basket . ”
An easy , free way to manage your name ’s SEO is by getting onto popular social media sites .
“ Twitter accounts often pop up on the first page even if you 've only posted three tweets , ” Benton explained .
“ Chances are you ’d rather have that and a link to your bio page than something you do n’t have control over .
Get on networks with good page rankings . ”
Another tip for optimizing SEO is by proactively setting up inbound links between your profiles .
Include links to your social profiles , such as Foursquare , Twitter , LinkedIn and Quora , on your blog .
On your Twitter profile , include a link to your blog .
And on Foursquare , make sure you include your Twitter profile link .
If you already use multiple networks , this practice is an easy way to increase the amount of inbound links for each site .
It 's a circle of links that will help optimize your Google search rankings .
The ultimate goal is to optimize your SEO so that someone should be able to search for your name and get a good idea within the first 10 results of who you are or who you ’d like to be .
4. Get a Little Help
The good news is that you do n’t have to monitor all these sites by yourself .
There are a bunch of web tools that can help you track or update your entire online presence .
Try using a multi-platform dashboards like Ping.fm , Tweetdeck , or Hootsuite to update your social media identity all from a central hub .
As a secondary step , if you ’re interested in seeing which sites are benefiting you the most from a PR point of view , set up Google Alerts on each of your profiles .

Hurd suggested adding a small Facebook logo to your Facebook profile pic , for example , so you can see when your Facebook profile ( along with a pic ) is linked to .
5. Human Afterall
Out of all these tips , perhaps the most important lesson is to just be yourself .
It may sound simple , but ultimately people are connecting with you because of who you are .
“ How people perceive you is through those interactions with your audience , not just a neat and tidy persona , ” Naslund said .
“ People want to see the person behind the persona . ”
Schawbel recommended being selective with your networks and genuinely connecting : “ If your Twitter handle or Facebook page is your name , it has to come from you . ”
That same sense of honesty can also be a great way to find customers .
" These platforms are a huge opportunity to interact with users one - on - one , " Shapiro said .
Connecting in an honest way can bring in new supporters for your product or brand .

[ 1/29 Update : Kalambrew is reporting more on the mini-kegs and has announced that Oberon Day is Monday , March 29th . ]
( Kalamazoo , MI ) – Someone in Kalamazoo has a thing for surrealist paintings !
Bell ’s Brewery will add some historical significance to its Oberon mini-kegs when they are released this spring ( typically in May ) .
The mini-kegs will feature an interpretation of Salvador Dali ’s masterpiece , “ The Persistence of Memory . ”
The clocks from the original are replaced with Oberon logos .
The painting celebrates its 75th anniversary and appears to be part of the collection at the Museum of Modern Art in NYC :
“ Time is the theme here , from the melting watches to the decay implied by the swarming ants .
The monstrous fleshy creature draped across the paintings center is an approximation of Dalís own face in profile .
Mastering what he called “ the usual paralyzing tricks of eye - fooling , ” Dalí painted this work with “ the most imperialist fury of precision , ” but only , he said , “ to systematize confusion and thus to help discredit completely the world of reality . ”
There is , however , a nod to the real :
The distant golden cliffs are those on the coast of Catalonia , Dalís home . ”

When Sally graduated from college , she had aspirations of finding a career in project management .
And much to her delight , she landed a great position with a large , internationally - based consulting firm .
In addition to billing out fresh college graduates at obscenely high rates , the company developed obscenely expensive software for large enterprises .
With the vast majority of the firm ’s software development being performed at the other end of the world , they relied heavily on teams at the client ’s site to define application requirements and act as the “ face ” for the offshore developers .
Sally was hired to work on these types of teams and , and to her , it seemed like a perfect fit .
Soon after being brought on , Sally was given a thorough “ onshoring ” training course at the company ’s US headquarters .
Basically , it was everything one needed to know to be a highly - paid consultant : proper protocol for communicating between the various groups , the importance of good documentation , and a crash course in project management best practices .
Everything was a little bit rushed , but the instructors explained that everything was simply an overview – the real training would be learned on the job .
On the last day of training , Sally expected to receive her first assignment , but instead she returned home without any further direction .
Naturally concerned , Sally called the HR representative who had hired her and asked when she might expect to be assigned to a client .
“ Oh , that ’s because you ’ve been temporarily benched , ” explained her HR rep , “ Do n’t worry though , really it should only be a week , tops ! ”
The rep further explained that while on the bench , she would receive a full salary with benefits , and to think of it as a “ paid vacation , minus the vacation part . ”
Sally was told to take advantage of the time to hone her skills and read up on some of the technologies that the company works with .
At first , it was complete bliss : getting paid to sleep in past 10 am , getting paid to eat corn flakes , getting paid to watch Jerry Springer , and then getting paid to read “ SAP Best Practices ” at the local Starbucks .
After the week had passed , Sally gave her rep a ring just to make sure that everything was ok and when she might expect her next assignment .
“ We ’re working on it ! ” replied the cheery HR rep , “ Things are kind of in a holding pattern ... recession , dontchaknow ! ” she chuckled under her breath .
Sally asked when she might want to touch base again but she received a curt , and almost cliché , “ Do n’t call us , we ’ll call you . ”
Skip ahead a year later when Sally ’s phone rings - it was the HR department of the company that she had received a steady stream of paychecks for the past 11 months and 22 days .
Turns out that a position at a client site had finally materialized ... in Seattle ... some thousand miles away .
Starting Monday .
Such a sudden and radical move was n’t something that Sally had expected , but at this point , any opportunity seemed better than baking an anniversary cake for her time sitting on the bench .
So , after some quick negotiations of the wheres and whens , Sally packed her things , boarded a flight , and booked a nice hotel room nearby the client site where she could stay .
It was n’t too long before Sally realized that something was seriously amiss .
As it turned out , some requirement was mistranslated by someone , and the client did n’t actually need an off - shore liaison .
No , they needed a mid-level experienced VB developer .
Of course , since both the client and the consulting firm turn around as fast as a battleship , it took two full months for the mess to be sorted out .
All the while , Sally did exactly what she had done for the past year : nothing .
The only difference was she had to continue living out of a hotel and report to the client ’s site every day .
Eventually , Sally was finally told to return home and await a new assignment .
The HR rep promised her that they had a new , tentative assignment that was “ right around the corner . ”
To this day , Sally is still waiting for that assignment and , of course , continuing to receive paychecks .
But this time , she ’s spending her bench time brushing up on her job interviewing skills .
Making a living as an illustrator is a dream for many young artists – but it takes more than dreaming to impress potential clients .
A successful illustrator needs flare , persistence and a strong portfolio .
Over the years I 've experimented with various mediums and techniques to establish a broad range of styles .
In this article I 'd like to share my thoughts and experiences with using multiple illustration styles , as opposed to fixating on just one .
What is Style ?
Style refers to visual vocabulary ; such as color , shape , line weight and principles of proportion .
It can also refer to the tools / techniques used to create the illustration .
This image uses color and Illustrator 's symbol feature in a creative way – it's also a style that I 'm keen to evolve .
Client : Digital Arts magazine .
Software : Illustrator and Photoshop .
If you 're planning on developing a range of styles , it 's important to be true to yourself and not slavishly copy current trends .
My best advice would be to gravitate towards the styles of work you feel most comfortable with and build up a strong portfolio that reflects the commissions you want .
Illustrators are often requested to follow current trends – that 's inevitable ; just remember though , that by following trends , you 'll never set them !
This commission takes inspiration from the cheesy B movie posters of the 50s .
Client : Digital Arts magazine .
Software : Bryce , Photoshop and Illustrator .
I 've had numerous commissions where art directors will place an existing illustration into a design or mock up and ask me to produce something similar for the finished artwork .
Through my experience this is common working practice , because art directors are busy people who need to relay their ideas quickly .
In cases like this it's best to " air on the side of caution " and inject as much of your own individual flair as possible , what 's more a good art director will welcome your input .
For these web banner illustrations the art director initially emailed me a selection of styles he liked .
These samples were then used as an incentive to generate my own unique style .
Client : VHD Creative .
Software : Illustrator .
It 's also worth noting that the most successful illustrators have what 's known as a signature style .
This is similar to how a brand or logo works to make their work instantly recognizable .
The repeating circular patterns that are abundant in Scott Hansen 's work are a prime example of a strong signature style .
Trends Change
Style , like fashion and music are in a constant state of flux ; what 's hot in the visual marketplace today maybe considered untrendy tomorrow .
Saying that , styles have the habit of re-emerging , albeit being slightly re-invented .
Illustration is also a diverse field , so for me it made sense to create a wide variety of styles that could allow for change .
This illustration borrows imagery from " The Son of Man , " by the surrealist painter René Magritte .

I began my career as a traditional designer and admit to being a complete technophobe when the desktop revolution arrived in the mid 80s .
I realized I had to embrace this new technology , or find another job .
The early Macs were unable to handle large image files .
Back then , Photoshop was solely used to scan lores sprinters or position guides and the printer stripped in hires scans at repro stage .
These images recapture some of my traditional hand painted illustration techniques .
Clients : Digital Arts and Photoshop Creative magazines .
Software : Photoshop .
Advances in technology now offer us new and exciting methods of producing imagery .
The 90s was saturated with what I call " program - led " style – illustrators were producing artwork with a sterile , computer - generated look .
What you need to remember is that 100 % digital work is very reliant on technique and therefore fairly easy to mimic , that 's probably why in recent years we 've witnessed a step back , towards a more hand - crafted aesthetic .

Other Applications
Although Photoshop is my primary illustration tool .
I also love the way Illustrator and Photoshop work in tandem ; for example , pasting Smart Objects from Illustrator into Photoshop and exporting Photoshop paths to Illustrator .
I used a custom perspective grid and the Free Transform Tool to create this map , rather than relying on Illustrator 's built - in 3D effects – which can sometimes affect linework quality .
Client : Computer Arts magazine .
Software : Illustrator .
It also seemed a natural progression for me to explore 3D applications .
I currently use Poser , Daz Studio , Bryce and Cinema 4D .
I would n't claim to be an expert in the 3D arena , so I make up for any shortcomings with some Photoshop magic !
This illustration was inspired by the 80s airbrush artist Hajime Sorayama .
Client : MetalFX Technology .
Software : Poser , Bryce and Photoshop .
There are certain styles that I would never attempt , such as a hyper - realistic cut away drawing of a car for example .
This is quite a specialized field and best left to the experienced professionals .
I can remember being in awe at some of the technical drawing student 's airbrush work back in my collage days .
This product design is probably the closest thing I 've done to technical illustration .
Client : Advanced Photoshop magazine .
Software : Photoshop .
Promote Yourself
I get a steady flow of freelance work from regular clients , so I guess having a varied range of styles has paid off for me .
As well as having a strong web presence , I 've found that sending out regular mailshots also generates new business .
I mail samples that showcase some of my best work to a database of existing and potential clients ( this can be costly , but it does pay off when you consider the amount of new business generated ) , I then make follow up phone calls to check it 's arrived OK and also get feedback .
I can remember being totally amazed when one art director thought I was an illustration agency representing different illustrators !
Here 's my " What 's Your Brief " mailer .
Unfolded , it measures 32 '' , so hopefully it will stick in peoples mind and they 'll keep it to hand .
Final Thoughts
We 're all different , so I 'm not saying working in numerous styles is right for everyone , although I firmly believe diversity shows adaptability and dexterity .
In fact , the only downside to having a varied portfolio is that some art directors may consider you a " jack of all trades and a master of none " if your work is not polished to a high enough level .
Vladimir Putin Hints At Return To Russian Presidency
In 2012
Doug Mataconis · · No comments
Just a little more than two years after leaving office due to a Constitutional term limit , former Russian President Vladimir Putin is hinting that he will make a bid to return to power when Russia holds elections in 2012 :
MOSCOW – Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and President Dmitry Medvedev are already considering their roles in the 2012 presidential election , Putin told French media Wednesday .
“ Naturally , I am already thinking about this issue with President Medvedev but have decided not to make much fuss about it , not to let ourselves be distracted by this problem , ” Putin said .
His comments to French media were reported by Russian news agencies .
Putin , president from 2000 to 2008 , anointed Medvedev as his successor when his second consecutive term — the maximum allowed under the constitution — expired .
But Putin , the country ’s most popular politician , can run for president again in 2012 and stay in power until 2024 if he wins two more terms , extended under new rules to six years .
Since 2008 the duo have been running the country in a tandem , with Medvedev overseeing foreign policy and Putin concentrating on domestic issues and measures to overcome Russia ’s deepest economic crisis in a decade .
“ What we will do in 2012 will depend on the results ( of our work ) , ” Putin said in an interview ahead of his visit to France , which starts Thursday .
He said there was “ no need to interfere in each other ’s area of competence . ”
None of this should come as a surprise , of course .
As soon as Putin anointed his long - time acolyte Medvedev as his Presidential successor , and then Medvedev turned around and immediately named Putin has Prime Minister , it was fairly clear that Putin would remain , if not the de jure power in Russia , the de facto man in charge .
In fact , the past two years have made fairly clear that Putin probably does n’t need to reclaim to title of President in order to maintain the power that he has in Russia , although I ’m sure it would be a nice feather in his cap and would allow him , as President , to once again become the public face of Russia to the world .
It ’s a cynical move , no doubt , but this is Russia and , as Anne Applebaum noted during the last round of elections , the Russian public seems to have given up on democracy :
ROSTOV-ON - DON , Russia , March 2 — Voters slogged through cold rain and mud Sunday to cast their ballots at Precinct No. 1619 on Pushkin Street here , though many expressed feelings about the state of democracy that were even gloomier than the weather .
“ Everyone understands that nothing can be changed , ” said Mariana Poromaryova , who voted for President Vladimir Putin ’s handpicked successor , Dmitry Medvedev .
She said Russia was a democracy in name only , with leaders lacking accountability to the people they rule .
“ The people live in one country , and the government in another , ” she said .
Moments later , another voter stormed off after an exit pollster asked about her vote .
“ I voted for anybody but United Russia ! ” she said , referring to the pro-Kremlin party that backs Medvedev .
“ Because they are all the biggest crooks ! ”
Many voters expressed anger or apathy about a campaign without real competition .
In recent days , United Russia workers hit the streets with brochures and projected political ads onto buildings with laser light shows .
To which many Russians responded :
Why bother ?
“ United Russia will win probably , and there is no other choice , ” said Rosa Ivanovna Agaeva , 73 , a Communist Party supporter .
During Soviet rule , she said , there was not as much airy talk of democracy but a lot more economic security .
“ That was the way we lived , and we got used to it , ” said Agaeva , who worked in a pharmacy .
“ You were given a job with regular pay . ”
Since there does n’t appear to be any real opposition to the Putin / Medvedev bloc , it seems the Russian people are doomed for the moment to live in a country where democracy is little more than a sham .
If you ’re using Sudo , you ’ve probably already discovered that the increased privileges apply only to the first command typed and do n’t extend to any input or output redirection .
For example :
With Sudo , a sys admin can allow certain users to run commands as root or another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their arguments .
Unfortunately , increased privileges usually apply only to the first command typed .
Here ’s how to extend them to any input or output redirection .
sudo iptables - L > /etc/iptables
will give you a ‘ Permission denied ’ error because the shell interprets the first command ( with sudo ) , then pipes it into the second command ( without sudo ) .
One solution to this is to jump straight into the root user shell with su .
However , this ignores all the many very good reasons to use sudo in the first place ( including logging , ticketing and a lower risk of accidentally doing something foolish because you ’ve left a root shell lying around ) .
A better solution is to use sudo to run bash .
Just typing
sudo bash
is n’t great , as this would put you in much the same position as just using su .
However , if you use the -c option , you can execute a single command and then return to your original shell :
sudo bash - c ' iptables - L > /etc/iptables '
Another option uses echo and a second pipe :
echo 'iptables - L > /etc/iptables ' | sudo bash
This method really comes into its own if you ’re building up a particularly complicated command , as it allows you to confirm what you ’re doing in advance .
Type
echo 'iptables - L > /etc/iptables '
and you ’ll see the command you ’re about to run echoed to your screen .
This makes sure there are n’t any unexpected escapes or similar in there .
Then , recall the previous command with the up arrow , and add | sudo bash ( or | sudo sh , if you prefer ) to the end .
Helpfully , these are all fairly easy to edit from the previous line , for those all - too - common occasions when you forget about the redirection issue until the error reminds you .

Five sharpshooters fired bullets through the heart of double murderer Ronnie Lee Gardner on Friday , making him the first US prisoner in 14 years to be executed by firing squad .
ADVERTISEMENT
Shackled to a chair and with a black hood covering his head , Gardner , 49 , was put to death just after midnight in a brightly lit execution chamber at Utah State Prison .
Salt Lake Tribune reporter Nate Carlisle , one of nine journalists who witnessed the execution , “ focused on [ Gardner ’s ] fist . ”
At the bottom of his restraint , I focused on his fist .
Gardner died much the way he lived — with a clenched fist .
“ At the time , I interpreted this as Gardner suffering — clenching his fist in an effort to fight the pain , ” Carlisle writes .
As I write this , I do n’t know whether that ’s true .
It could have just been reflexes or some other process the body begins after a major trauma .
Scientists do not know much about what a person shot through the heart feels .
ADVERTISEMENT
Carlisle writes that he ’s “ amazed ” that so many people have asked him if it ’s the only execution he ever witnessed , but never once writes how he felt watching a man shot to death , whom he described in his last moments as looking like “ Utah ’s own ghost of Hannibal Lecter . ”
“ Firing four bullets into a man ’s chest is , by definition , violent , ” Carlisle writes , before noting , “ If it can also be clinical and sterile , then that also happened in this execution . ”
Asked if he had any last words , Gardner , who had been on death row for 25 years , replied : “ I do not .
No . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The warden “ reached up and gently pulled a hood over Gardner ’s head , ” Carlisle writes .
Over the next 30 seconds , my heart raced .
I realized the five gunmen would launch their volleys any moment .
I placed a Styrofoam plug in my right ear to match the one I had earlier placed in my left .
The other reporters and I stood in front of the glass .
I watched Gardner .
As the seconds passed , I grew anxious .
I pivoted my eyes away from Gardner toward the slits .
In that fraction of a second my eyes were in transit , I heard “ boom boom . ”
The sounds were as close together as you could spew them from your mouth .
My eyes darted back to Gardner and to his chest .
The target , perfect just a second earlier , had three holes .
The largest hole was in the top half of the circle and toward Gardner ’s left side .
It may have been where two bullets entered Gardner .

Carlisle ’s last image : “ In the final second , my eyes focused on the straightened left arm , seemingly flexing , and that clenched fist . ”
Utah Department of Corrections director Thomas Patterson told reporters Gardner was pronounced dead two minutes after being shot .
“ This is an unusual task but one we have done professionally , ” Patterson said .
“ It has been done with absolute dignity and reverence for human life .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It ’s been a balancing act of being sensitive to the families who lost loved ones and the family who lost a loved one tonight . ”
Journalists who witnessed the execution reported seeing Gardner ’s arm twitch up and down after the firing squad blasted their 30/30 caliber Winchester rifles at a small target placed over Gardner ’s heart .
“ It was so sudden , so quick .
Boom , boom , just like that .
We did n’t get a countdown .
It happened so quickly , ” said Marcos Ortiz of KTVX TV .
Gardner ’s gruesome death was billed as a bloody throwback to the days of Old West justice , the first execution of its kind in the United States for more than a decade and possibly the last ever .
ADVERTISEMENT
But there was an unmistakably 21st century twist to his final minutes when Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff used micro-blogging site Twitter to announce he had given the final approval for the execution .
“ I just gave the go - ahead to Corrections Department to proceed with Gardner ’s execution , ” Shurtleff tweeted shortly before Gardner was shot .
“ May God grant him the mercy he denied his victims . ”
Firing squads were outlawed by Utah in 2004 but the ban was not retroactive , allowing Gardner the freedom to opt for the gruesome method instead of lethal injection during a hearing in April .
Gardner had spent 25 years on death row for gunning down an attorney in a failed bid to escape from a court room in 1985 during a murder trial .
His case had renewed debate about use of the death penalty in the United States and divided family and friends of his victims .
ADVERTISEMENT
Loved ones of lawyer Michael Burdell , shot dead by Gardner in his botched escape attempt , have said they were against his execution because Burdell opposed the death penalty .
“ Michael was a gentle soul .
And he loved people and he loved life .
And he would not have wanted Ronnie Lee to be killed , especially in his name , ” Donna Nu , Burdell ’s fiancee , told CNN earlier Thursday .
“ I think that we as a human race — all the brilliant minds we have on this planet — we could come up maybe with something better . ”
Gardner ’s death came after a day which saw his lawyers fail with multiple appeals to have the execution stayed , lobbying Utah Governor Gary Herbert , a federal court in Denver and the US Supreme Court .
All three bids were rejected .
“ Upon careful review , there is nothing in the materials provided this morning that has not already been considered and decided by the Board of Pardons and Parole or numerous courts , ” Herbert wrote .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Mr Gardner has had a full and fair opportunity to have his case considered by numerous tribunals . ”
The Utah Department of Corrections said Gardner was “ relaxed ” Thursday , spending the day reading a David Baldacci novel — “ Divine Justice ” — while watching “ The Lord of the Rings ” fantasy trilogy .
He was served his final meal — steak , lobster , apple pie , vanilla ice cream and 7 - Up — on Tuesday before choosing to commence a 48 - hour fast before his execution for undisclosed reasons .
He met his attorney during the morning , after saying goodbye to his brother and daughter on Wednesday through prison bars .

Gardner requested none of his family members be present at his execution , which was witnessed by a small group of state officials , relatives of Gardner ’s victims and journalists from local media outlets .
Instead , Gardner ’s loved ones huddled in a car park outside the prison close to an area where some family members of the killer ’s other victims gathered .
Gardner ’s family , including a brother and his daughter , linked arms and held candles , singing the Lynyrd Skynyrd classic “ Free Bird ” before releasing balloons carrying messages such as “ We love you Ronnie .

I once took part in a vodka tasting contest , in which participants tried to tell an expensive brand from a cheap one .
I do n’t recall the exact outcome , for obvious reasons .
But I do know that several people swore they could taste the difference .
Well , maybe they could .
Because according to a study in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry , different vodkas can have different molecular “ structures , ” which could drive drinkers to favor one brand over another .
[ Naiping Hu et al. , http://bit.ly/bktqSV]
Vodka ’s an alcoholic beverage that ’s supposed to be relatively flavorless .
So researchers got to wondering : how come people who enjoy the stuff often express brand preference ?
Being good little scientists , they trotted out their spectroscopic equipment and examined the chemical signatures of five different vodkas .
What they found is that each brand differs in how its ethanol molecules cluster .
In the ethanol - water mix we call vodka , some of the ethanol molecules get surrounded by a sort of “ cage ” made of water .
And different brands differ in how much ethanol is caged .
Vodkas with fewer cages might seem more “ watery ” than those with more structure .
Of course , drink enough of the stuff and it really wo n’t matter how tightly caged it is .
You ’ll be loose as a grey goose .

Image caption The Kuiper Belt is home to several dwarf planets , one of which is Pluto
Astronomers say they have observed , for the first time , a distant icy world orbiting beyond Neptune as it passed briefly in front of a bright star .
This " stellar occultation " occurs when a planetary body hides a star as it moves across the sky .
A US - led team of 18 astronomy groups used the occasion to study KBO 55636 from the Kuiper Belt on the outskirts of the Solar System .
They tell the journal Nature that the occultation lasted only 10 seconds .
But this was enough time to determine the object 's size and albedo , or reflectivity , the team said .
The Kuiper Belt is a collection of space objects , remnants from the Solar System 's formation .
These objects lie beyond the orbit of the Solar System 's most remote planet , Neptune .
The Kuiper Belt is similar to the asteroid belt , but instead of being composed of mainly rock and metal , most of its bodies are frozen volatiles - methane , ammonia and water .
Space impact
So far , scientists have detected over a thousand Kuiper Belt Objects ( KBOs ) , but they believe that there may be as many as 70,000 of them .
The lead author of the study , MIT professor of planetary astronomy , James Elliot , told BBC News that the recently observed KBO 55636 probably formed as a result of a space collision about one billion years ago .
He said that a dwarf planet known as Haumea might have been hit by another object , and this impact caused Haumea 's icy mantle to break into a dozen smaller pieces , including KBO 55636 .
The Kuiper Belt is home to several dwarf planets , one of which is Pluto .
Prof Elliot explained that in order to spot KBO 55636 as it passed in front of a star , he had to get together a team of 42 astronomers from 18 observation stations located in Australia , South Africa , Mexico and the US .
" For several years , we 've been accurately measuring the position of the KBO .
" With an accurate orbit , we just projected where it was going to be in the sky and looked for stars that it might occult . "
The scientist explained that it was hard to predict exactly where the KBO would pass .
In order " to be on the safe side " , his team used a number of observation stations along a 5,900 km stretch of the Earth 's surface that corresponded to the predicted shadow path of the space body .
" It was our way of hedging our bets , " he said .
Out of the 18 telescopes aimed at the sky , only two stations , both in Hawaii , managed to detect the 10 - second - long stellar occultation .
High albedo
The researchers then measured the exact amount of time that the star was blocked from view and the velocity of the KBO 's shadow moving across Hawaii .
Using this data , the team determined the object 's size - about 300 km in diameter - and its albedo , or ability to reflect light .
The scientists thought that the surface of KBO 55636 would be rather dull , unable to reflect much light due to space weathering , dust accumulation and bombardment by cosmic rays .
But the results were unexpected , said Prof Elliot .
" We found out that this object is much smaller than we thought before and that it is very reflective - it reflects most of the light that hits the surface . "
He explained that the surface is probably made of ice - very much like the surface of Pluto .
But bigger objects , such as Pluto or Saturn 's moon Enceladus , are able to brighten their surfaces with a fresh supply of ice from processes such as cryovolcanism which sees ice - not lava - spew from the interior of the objects .
This explanation did not really apply to the KBO due to its tiny size and the time it had spent floating in space , said the professor .
" I am not sure [ why the albedo is so high ] .
Maybe because water - ice surfaces are more robust and do n't get darkened by cosmic ray impacts and other things that darken other surfaces . "
I attended yesterday 's C - 32 media lockup on behalf of the Toronto Star , who asked for a quick analysis piece of the bill .
My column is posted below :
Copyright has long been viewed as one of the government 's most difficult and least rewarding policy issues .
It attracts passionate views from a wide range of stakeholders , including creators , consumers , businesses , and educators and is the source of significant political pressure from the United States .
Opinions are so polarized that legislative reform is seemingly always the last resort that only comes after months of delays .
The latest chapter in the Canadian copyright saga unfolded yesterday as Industry Minister Tony Clement and Canadian Heritage James Moore tabled copyright reform legislation billed as providing both balance and a much - needed modernization of the law .
The bill will require careful study ( suggestions that a quick set of summer hearings will provide an effective review should be summarily rejected ) but the initial analysis is that there were some serious efforts to find compromise positions on many thorny copyright issues .
Unfortunately , the legal protection for digital locks – unquestionably the biggest and most controversial digital copyright issue – is the one area where there is no compromise .
Despite a national copyright consultation that soundly rejected inflexible protections for digital locks on CDs , DVDs , e-books , and other devices , the government has caved to U.S. pressure and brought back rules that mirror those found in the United States .
These rules limit more than just copying as they can also block Canadian consumers from even using products they have purchased .
Bill C - 32 , which ironically carries the same number as the last time Canada underwent major copyright reforms in 1997 , features three types of provisions : sector - specific reforms , compromise provisions , and the no-compromise digital lock rules .
The sector - specific reforms are designed to address a single constituency or stakeholder concern .
These reforms include something for almost everyone : new rights for performers and photographers , a new exception for Canadian broadcasters , new liability for BitTorrent search services , as well as the legalization of common consumer activities such as recording television shows and transferring songs from a CD to an iPod .
In fact , there is even a “ YouTube ” user - generated content remix exception that grants Canadians the right to create remixed work for non-commercial purposes under certain circumstances .
There are a number of areas where the government has worked toward a genuine compromise .
This includes reform to Canada 's fair dealing provision , which establishes when copyrighted works may be used without permission .
The government rejected both pleas for no changes as well as arguments for a flexible fair dealing that would have opened the door to courts adding exceptions to the current fair dealing categories of research , private study , news reporting , criticism , and review .
Instead , it identified some specific new exceptions that assist creators ( parody and satire ) , educators ( education exception , education Internet exception ) , and consumers ( time shifting , format shifting , backup copies ) .
The Internet provider liability similarly represent a compromise , as the government is sticking with a " notice - and - notice " system that requires providers to forward allegations of infringement to subscribers .
The system is costly for the providers , but has proven successful in discouraging infringement .
It also compromised on the statutory damages rules that create the risk of multi-million dollar liability for cases of non-commercial infringement .
The new rules reduce non-commercial liability to a range of $ 100 to $ 5,000 , which is not insignificant but well below the $ 20,000 per infringement cap currently found in the law .
All these attempts at balance should be welcomed , yet they are undermined by the no-compromise position on digital locks .
The foundational principle of the new bill is that anytime a digital lock is used , it trumps virtually all other rights .
This means that both the existing fair dealing rights and Bill C - 32's new rights all cease to function effectively so long as the rights holder places a digital lock on their content or device .
Moreover , the digital lock approach is not limited to fair dealing – library provisions include a requirement for digital copies to self - destruct within five days and distance learning teaching provisions require the destruction of course materials 30 days after the course concludes .
The government could have introduced a compromise provision that would have allowed for compliance with international treaties , protection for digital locks and the preservation of the copyright balance .
In failing to strike that balance , the government has introduced a flawed , but potentially fixable bill .
Hello all , posted a long time ago regarding getting a sailboat and learning to sail .
Well , over the past year I have taken US Sailing classes and purchased a 1977 Catalina 22 ( on the advice of sailing friends who said start small and with something you can sail now ) .
Spent three months rebuilding her , upgrading rigging and such , and have now spent the last few months sailing her off the coast of Tybee Island , Ga .
Fun little boat and some really relaxing days sailing around .
However , yesterday we got caught in our first storm on a sailboat .
Let me describe what happened , what I did , what I think I did wrong , and the outcome .
Maybe some of you with experience can critique my actions so that I can learn from them .
First off , I fully understand that the Catalina 22 is not designed for any kind of heavy weather or even use in the ocean .
After yesterday I may be looking to sell her and purchase something more suited to the area in which I sail .
Now on to the story ;
Yesterday started out perfectly , marine weather forecast called for partly cloudy , winds 10 - 15 knots , seas 2 - 3 feet with a 20 % chance of a thunderstorm late in the day .
Actual weather was sunny , 5 - 10 knot winds with 2 - 3 foot waves .
We sailed out about 2 miles from shore tacking every half mile or so trying to make it to Saint Cathrine 's island .
Somewhere around 1530 hrs we noticed thunderheads a long distance away appearing south .
I decided to turn around and run North back to Tybee and the protected inlet of the Savannah River .
We were making good speed until suddenly all wind died .
The sun was still out and the storm , though closing , was still far on the horizon .
After about 35 minutes , the wind resumed at around the same speed as before .
Now , I am running a 150 Genoa and a full Mainsail , the only sails I have as my working Jib fell apart from age .
After running for about an hour , the storm started filling the sky behind us .
The wind started picking up though not dangerously .
I started thinking about reducing sail but because we were making good speed I decided to hold on a little longer .
This I believe was my first mistake , because about 10 minutes later , the wind started gusting to about force 3 - 4 .
The boat began to surf and seemed to plane .
I told the girl to hold the tiller and keep the boat pointed downwind as I went forward to wrestle down the genny and secure it .
I managed to do this without to much fuss though the jib halyard broke free and flew around near horizontal for the remainder of the storm .
( at this point we could not turn into the wind to take down sail as it would have capsized us )
Once the genny was down the boat became controllable again and we continued to run under full mainsail with the sheet all the way out .
I had never reefed the main before and could n't find any line small enough to do so but I kept thinking that I needed to reef NOW !!!!
We were at this point about a half mile from the turn into the Savannah River .
Suddenly , the storm winds hit , wind indicator showed sustained 37 mph with gusts to 48 .
The waves became taller than the cabin of the boat and salt water filled the air .
Mistake number 2 , I should have dropped the main before the winds hit .
Though I thought we could make it .
Again I told the girl to hold the tiller ( which at this time had so much weather helm that it was almost impossible to keep the boat straight .
It would round up to port even with two hands pulling the rudder and bracing against the cockpit .
She was screaming that she could n't hold it but I knew I had to drop the main .
I waited until we were in between waves and jumped up , released the halyard and wrestled the main down , wrapped it around the boom and secured it with bungee cords .
We were now running under bare poles and it seemed to be somewhat more comfortable .
Though she still had amazingly strong weather helm and waves were boarding over the transom .
( Cockpit lockers are water tight and secured , additional drains have been installed in the cockpit and I had put the companionway boards in earlier so they were draining quickly and to me posed no real threat ) .
Now , on to my biggest mistake .
What I think I should have done is maintain sea room and continue to run as I had control , I was watertight and the storm was fast moving .
What I did was try to turn into to Savannah River inlet and make it to the protection of the cove .
First let me describe the inlet .
The Savannah River inlet is about three miles wide , has submerged rock jetties dividing it into two channels .
A major shipping lane goes through the southern side .
Massive sand bars line both sides and run right up to the navigational buoys .
The tide was outgoing against the wind and the water depth goes from 40 ' to 7 ' very quickly .
Basically , 5 - 6 foot swells become 6 - 7 ' breakers very quickly .
By turning to port under bare poles I lost steerage way and began taking large breaking waves on my beam .
I started the outboard ( useless as it was out of the water most of time ) and tried to make some sort of headway .
I kept trying to run a bit and then turn to port to make it the half mile or so to get behind the island .
After doing this for the longest 35 minutes of my life , and having one particularly large breaker lift us up , roll us over till the starboard windows were submerged and then slide us down the wave ( thank god the keel was down ) we began to get shielded by the island .
Suddenly , the wind stopped , the waves dissipated and the sun came out ..... it became the most beautiful time yet on the water .
Dolphins were playing , gulls were circling , it was almost surreal .
As if we had just passed a test and this was the reward ...
Now , I would like to say it was my actions that saved us that day but I know it was pure luck .
I made some near fatal mistakes yesterday that could have cost me the boat and possibly our lives .
Though this may seem petty to those who brave mid ocean storms with 40 ' waves and 60 knot winds .
Our little gale with 6 - 7 foot breakers in a 1900 pound 22 ' boat seemed serious enough to us ...
Now , what could I have done better ?
I have been in worse storms in a small Boston Whaler that seemed safer than this sailboat .
This boat was all over the place , weather helm was so strong I thought the tiller would break .
I have come up with my own conclusions that I would appreciate comments on ;
1 ) If you think a storm is approaching and the weather report confirms this , if you can take refuge in the nearest leeward cove or behind the lee of an island , do it .
If you cannot ,
2 ) Seriously reduce sail area well before the winds hit , in a small boat like the Catalina 22 this may be all sails down and secure .
3 ) If you get caught in the storm , maintain sea room and stay the hell out of harbors and river inlets until the storm passes .
Wave heights in these areas are astronomical .
4 ) Never take waves on the beam , if your running continue to do so .
5 ) Outboards are useless in a seaway .
Being that we survived this , I am taking this as a stern lesson from the sea .
Apparently she is not a theoretical teacher .
She teaches you in ways that force you to learn and if you fail , you do n't come back .
What should I have done differently ?
The situation was very scary in this boat , is this boat really so bad in these conditions that I need to look at buying a different boat ?
Would a heavy displacement , 27 ' boat have made a difference or was it simply my inexperience that made it so scary ?
All in all I am amazed at how quickly the sea can become dangerous and though it was quite terrifying , I look forward to the next sail ...

Has the World Cup referee who hosed the U.S. been benched ?
Maybe .
Koman Coulibaly -- who set off a firestorm of fan anger when he inexplicably disallowed a goal that could have given the U.S. a victory against Slovenia -- is n't on the list of officials for the next World Cup matches .
The latest list , sent out via e-mail by FIFA , covers games for tomorrow and Wednesday .
Those games include the crucial U.S. - Algeria Group C finale on Wednesday .
FIFA likes the job the referees are doing .
That does n't mean Coulibaly , of Mali , wo n't oversee further action before the tournament ends July 11 .
But it raises the question of whether he 's facing an unofficial punishment .
FIFA announces officials as competition progresses , and wo n't make a specific comment regarding Coulibaly according to Bloomberg .
The head of the officials , Jose Maria Garcia Aranda , is scheduled to meet with news media today , but FIFA said he would n't be commenting on decisions made so far during the tournament .
More than a century has passed since the public open house was held for the Salt Lake Temple , but an exhibit featuring a 1:32 scaled replica of the Mormon temple opened today that offers an open house experience of the magnificent building .
Earlier this morning , The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints unveiled the 88 - inch tall , near - identical replica of the temple in the South Visitors ’ Center on Temple Square .
The permanent exhibit will be open to the public starting at 1:30 p.m. today .
“ This replica will show the millions of visitors who come to Temple Square the beauty and majesty of this sacred and historic building , ” said Elder Richard G. Hinckley , executive director of the Missionary Department .
“ Like all temples , once the building is dedicated it is used for sacred Church purposes and not open to the general public , but this exhibit will provide the public with a glimpse of the interior and a feeling of the Spirit that is present there . ”
The Salt Lake Temple is a landmark known throughout the world .
When it was last open to the public in April of 1893 , the local press reported that approximately 5,000 people , most of whom were not members of the Church , toured the temple before the dedication .
The reports went on to say that “ altogether the richness and elegant workmanship of the temple was a revelation of wonder to the visitors . ”

Extensive open houses have been held prior to the dedication of newly constructed temples throughout the world and allow visitors to walk through and experience the sacred structures .
Once dedicated , temples are in continual , even daily , use by members of the Church for religious purposes .
While public open houses for new temples regularly draw tens and even hundreds of thousands of people , millions will likely see this model of the Salt Lake Temple over its lifetime .
“ Many people think our temples are like great halls or cathedrals .
Actually , they have a number of rooms designed for certain functions such as marriages , baptisms and instructional sessions , ” said Elder William R. Walker , executive director of the Church ’s Temple Department .
The model of the Salt Lake Temple sits in front of a giant window in the South Visitors ’
Center facing the actual building that it replicates .
The south and east walls of the replica have been cut away to show depictions of many of the rooms in the temple , including the large assembly hall and rooms where the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles meet .
The baptistery and other ordinance rooms are also depicted .
Close attention is paid to detail , and even paintings , furniture and working chandeliers and lamps imitate those found in the actual temple .
Peter McCann Architectural Models of Toronto was commissioned to create the replica last August .
Sixteen modelers with different expertise in various parts of the duplication process worked on the project for five months .
( Click here for fact sheet , photos and audio sound bites about the creation process ) .
“ Some of the detail is so fine that we had to find people that were capable of doing it at that scale , ” said Josh Coulas , manager of the project for Peter McCann Architectural Models .
In addition to the scaled model , the new display in the South Visitors ’
Center features new kiosks that show high - definition photos and video of the Salt Lake Temple interior rooms .
A narrator gives an explanation of the purpose of the rooms and a diagram shows where they are located on the model .
The presentation is very similar to what a person would experience during the public open house of a temple .
“ This new display will give people another reason to visit Temple Square for the first time or for the hundredth time , ” said Elder Hinckley .
“ Because of its history and spiritual significance , this temple is beloved by millions and recognized as an icon of Mormonism throughout the world . ”
Brigham Young designated the location for the Salt Lake Temple just days after the first group of pioneers came into the Salt Lake Valley .
Construction began on the building in 1853 and was completed in 1893 .
More than just a structure with a beautiful and functional design , the temple was central to the faith of the pioneers who settled the Salt Lake Valley .
Latter - day Saint temples are considered houses of God , a place of holiness and peace separate from the preoccupations of the world .
They provide a place where Church members make formal promises and commitments to God .
They are also the place where the highest sacraments of the faith occur — the marriage of couples and the “ sealing ” of families for eternity .
Anyone , regardless of religion , may enter a Latter - day Saint meetinghouse and attend services .
However , because of the sacredness of temples as “ houses of the Lord , ” only members of the Church who are in good standing are allowed to enter the temples .
A member must be observing the basic principles of the faith and attest to that fact to his or her local leaders once every two years in order to enter a temple .
The Salt Lake Temple was the sixth temple built by the Church .
Today there are 132 operating temples throughout the world .
BIG NAMES SLAMMING ISRAELI LOBBY LEADING U.S. ACADEMICS SAY ISRAEL A LIABILITY  FOR U.S. By Michael Collins Piper
It s received little attention among Americans who dont follow public affairs and its not been widely mentioned in the media across the country , at least thus far but among informed folks who closely follow the intrigues of the Israeli lobby , the release of a new report critical of Israel and its lobby has been the most talked - about subject of recent days .
Two of the most distinguished foreign policy specialists in the American academic world John Mearsheimer of the University of Chicago and Stephen Walt of Harvard have released a paper , entitled  The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy  that has some less than favorable things to say about Israel and the U.S. relationship with that tiny , yet powerful , foreign nation .
The 83 - page paper , which includes some 40 pages of detailed footnotes , was first published on the Internet , but a pared - down rendition of the paper was published on March 23 in The London Review of Books .
The article can be found on the internet at www.ssrn.com or at Harvards official web site , www.ksg.Harvard.edu/research/working_papers/index.htm.*
Ironically , as the New York - based newspaper , Forward , put it on March 24 , theres little that s new in the report .
Anyone who has been a reader of American Free Press or who , going back to the 1960s and 1970s , read other populist publications like Liberty Letter or The Spotlight knows whats now being reported by the two academics .
Although Americas mainstream media always portrayed Israel in the fondest light , free thinkers raised uncomfortable questions that suggested the truth might be different .
Such critics of the U.S. - Israel axis were called anti-Semites ,  and neo - Nazis and haters . 
Worldwide , in contrast , Israel and its American lobby have not been held in such esteem .
In 2002 , for example , South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu , whountil then was an icon of the American press , shocked many when he asserted that in the United States  the Israeli government is placed
on a pedestal ,  because , Tutu said ,  the Jewish lobby is powerfulvery powerful . 
Now Meirsheimer and Walt have stepped up to echo what critics of Israel have been saying for years .
However , what is disturbing to pro-Israel forces is that the academics , as Forward put it , cant be dismissed as cranks outside the mainstream . 
As the Jewish weekly put it :  They are the mainstream . 
Walt has not only been a Harvard professor , but hes also the outgoing academic dean of the universitys John F. Kennedy
In the wake of the firestorm directed at Harvard , the professors removed the Kennedy School logo from the paper on the Internet .
Despite this , as the papers critics have noted , the genie is out of the bottle and copies of the paper have been flying across the globe via email .
As a result , a lot of people who previously were told that criticism of Israel was the work of haters  and extremists  are learning that two of the most respected American foreign affairs specialists are saying some tough things about Israel , its Washington lobby and the dangers of the lobbys influence on U.S. foreign policy making .
On March 25 , the fiercely pro-Israel  Editorial Board column of The Wall Street Journal ( WSJ ) took the professors to task but accurately noted that :
[ The premise of Mearsheimer and Walt ] is that Israel is a huge strategic liability for the U.S. which wrecks our reputation in the Arab world , complicates our diplomacy at the UN , inspires Islamic fanaticism and terror , goads us into misbegotten wars and makes us complicit in Israeli human rights abuses , all the while costing some $ 3 billion a year .
Although the WSJ asserted Mearsheimer and Walt are not necessarily anti-Semitic ,  their paper is anti-Semitic in effect . 
Meanwhile , pro-Israel elements are touting the claim by another Harvard professor , pro-Israel agitator Alan Dershowitz , that the two largely relied on material on neo - Nazi and anti-Semitic web sites as their sources .
Dershowitz is not telling the truth .
The most cursory examination of the citations used by the duo demonstrates they used thoroughly mainstream sources as documentation .
The Washington Post , The New York Times , Israels Haaretz , the New York - based Jewish Week , and the aforementioned Forward were prominent among the sources .
In the meantime , on March 26 , The New York Daily News , owned by Mort Zuckerman , former chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations a major force in the Israeli lobby featured a commentarymaking the claim that there is no Israel lobby . 
Zuckermans tabloid repeated the old saw that Congress and American presidents have been friends of Israel out of humanitarian concerns and that the policies have nothing to do with any powerful lobby . 
However , that claim is refuted in the very first footnote in the Mearsheimer - Walt report , which says :  The mere existence of the lobby suggests that unconditional support for Israel is not in the American national interests .
If it was , one would not need an organized special interest group to bring it about .
But because Israel is a strategic and moral liability , it takes relentless political pressure to keep U.S. support intact . 
And so it is .
