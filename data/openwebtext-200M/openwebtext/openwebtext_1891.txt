Today , the Senate rejected a binding resolution that would have resulted in the withdrawal of American forces from Iraq within the next twelve months :
The Senate today rejected a binding Democratic - sponsored resolution that would have set a target date a little more than a year from now for the withdrawal of most U.S. combat troops from Iraq .
Senators then approved by large margins two nonbinding resolutions that express support for the troops .
The withdrawal resolution , which under a Senate agreement needed 60 votes to pass , failed to win even a majority , with 48 senators voting in favor of it and 50 against it .
The White House had threatened a veto if such a binding measure reached President Bush ’s desk .
( …. )
Two Democrats , Ben Nelson ( Neb. ) and Mark Pryor ( Ark. ) , and independent Joseph I. Lieberman ( Conn . ) joined Republicans in voting against the Democratic withdrawal plan .
One Republican , Gordon Smith ( Ore. ) , sided with most Democrats in supporting it .
Two senators did not vote .
The two Senators who did n’t vote were Tim Johnson of South Dakota , who is recovering from a stroke , and John McCain , who apparently is too busy campaigning for Grand Poobah President of the United States to actually do his job .
Most likely these two would have cancelled each others votes out , so the result would have been the same .
More importantly , though , today ’s vote in the Senate seems to be a fairly strong indication that the chances of America ’s involvement in the Iraq War ending before January 20 , 2009 are beyond infinitesimal .

How to get RSS right 7 March , 2007 — Stuart Brown 5 tips to help get subscribers , keep subscribers Posted in RSS and Syndication , Blogs & Blogging
Tagged with : rss , feed , syndication , tips RSS is an essential part of growing a blog 's audience , and most get the fundamentals right .
Some , however , do n't exactly embrace RSS as a medium - and occasionally those who do offer some limited , broken feed that simply is n't worth subscribing to .
Here are some pointers to keep your syndication on track .
Offer full feeds
If you 're not fully au fait with RSS yourself , you might not appreciate this one - but trust me , there 's nothing more annoying than reading an article in your aggregator then have it suddenly come to a halt .
Full feeds are better , and will help encourage readers to subscribe .
If you 're worried about lost ad revenue , do n't be - services such as FeedBurner and Feedvertising can be used to keep the money rolling in , whilst you keep your loyal subscribers happy .
Avoid amendments to feed items once they 're posted Some RSS aggregators will show a feed item as new for every spelling correction , alteration or amendment to a post - particularly so if you have full feeds .
Whilst I abhor bad spelling , try to minimise the corrections you make ( proof reading before publishing can do wonders ! ) , and you 'll avoid losing subscribers when the same post comes up 12 times in a row with indiscernible differences .
If you do update a post , it 's best done clearly marked with an ' UPDATE : ' at the bottom .
Do n't hide the link to your feeds
If your feed is n't linked via a < link > tag in your header , most web browsers wo n't pick up on your feeds - and if you hide the link to your feeds away at the bottom of the page , or partway down some obscure column , there 's a good chance a potential subscriber wo n't find your feed at all .
Make sure it 's obvious - but bigger is n't necessarily better .
Do n't post too often
Never posting any new content is bad enough , but posting too much ?
Even worse .
If subscribers can't keep up , they 'll unsubscribe very quickly indeed .
Split your feeds up if you find this is the case , or simply relax the rate at which you post .
Anything more than 20 a day is excessive , and most folk would probably prefer a lot less from most blogs .
Give your readers a good reason to subscribe
I 'd hate to labour a point , but it 's worth reiterating .
You can get everything spot on ( technically ) with your RSS feeds and still drive away potential subscribers , while other sites with terribly implemented feeds can attract thousands .
The real secret to getting a strong RSS readership is to write great content - get the technical details right , though , and you can help keep your subscribers happy .
Linux and Independent Software Vendors
Miguel de Icaza ( [ email protected ] )
A friend of mine at the Microsoft PDC conference who is an Independent Software Vendor ( ISV ) made a few observations : the continuous breakage of the Linux development platform is hurting them .
Linux is still a small market compared to the Windows and Mac markets .
In most cases , the revenue opportunities for the small and medium ISVs are too small to make a Linux port worthwhile , and when it is , the staffing requirements for maintaining and testing their software for a dozen of distributions and release versions quickly becomes a big burden .
In particular my friend complained about the a.out to ELF migration ;
Then the ELF libc5 to libc6 migration , and apparently the new version of libc6 breaks their application again .
They still update their software , but older binaries distributed to the public stop working on new releases of the product .
Internally I know that all those changes were needed for Linux , and also that it is possible for the Linux community to provide the backwards compatible packages .
Although this is possible in theory , in practice these compatibility libraries are not shipped with the main distributions .
In his view , this is scaring off developers ( both his customers and themselves ) , and he has noticed a decrease in the demand for their software on the Linux platform and an increase on the MacOS X platform .
As an anecdote I would not worry much about it , but the problems he described resounded with what we have heard from customers .
I used to think that the worst offender in breaking working applications was Debian .
Considering that the commercial distributions at least did an effort to make stable releases of their products , as opposed to the continuum of updates that Debian is .
Supporting Debian as an ISV is just too hard : there is no way to release software that will be usable a few months down the line , and there its too easy for a Debian user to accidentally move from `stable ' to their `bleeding edge ' setups .
But to these outsiders , Debian is not even on their radar : the support offered by the commercial Linux distributions is flaky compared to what they are used to from the Unix world and Windows .
At Ximian we had a similar experience : the Ximian Desktop was built , packaged and tested on a number of distributions ( Debian was supported once upon a time for example ) .
But as time went by the matrix of distributions that had to be supported kept on increasing , the small differences kept on creeping and we were not able to keep up maintaining and testing packages for all these combinations of Linux , let alone support them .
And keep in mind that Ximian was a company commited and devoted to support Linux - based applications .
Note about Debian : it is clearly the choice for many free software enthusiasts and is very entrenched due to its deep community roots .
Tools like apt - get help people try out the latest developments in the open source world with little effort , and their community commitment is fantastic , but is a very hard platform to support for an ISV .
As much as the free software community would like to see a fully open source system , with every conceivable tool and piece of software available as free software it will not happen in the short or medium term .
After all these years of working for this cause , we know that many of these applications will just not materialize as free software : games , vertical applications , developer tools , educational software , just to list a few .
To make Linux a viable platform for mainstream desktop use our community needs to realize the importance of these third - party vendors and not alienate them .
Having a stable API , and a stable ABI is very important for this reason .
GNOME has learned this lesson and has strict commitments on ABI / API stability ( thanks to our friends at Sun that pushed for this ) and the XFree folks deserve the credit for making ABI compatibility across operating systems a reality for their drivers .
Two good steps in the right direction .
And of course , part of the problem is that it is not fun to work on backwards compatible ways , nor is it fun to work when innovation is hampered by backwards compatibility .
Proprietary software is not going away any time soon , and our community should start thinking about ways of co-existing with it , such that ISVs help our platform by enriching it with a larger software offering .
Red Hat has taken an active approach at providing an API - stable edition of Linux with their enterprise editions .
It is good as a short - term solution , but it is not a long - term solution , nor a scalable one given Linux 's varied offerings .
We need to attack the problem at the roots :
The culture of API stability needs to be assimilated by maintainers and developers .
Which brings me to Mono ( funny how everything I think revolves around this topic ) .
With Mono we are trying to keep things compatible with the .NET Framework : even when we believe we can do better , we avoid introducing incompatible changes .
When we have new functionality , we encourage our developers to expose that new functionality in a new library , and encourage them to make it available also to .NET developers ( System .
Security / Mono .
Security is the best example of this pattern ) .
We very much hope that Mono will become the standard development platform that developers are looking for : a platform that makes strong API / ABI commitments , supports older versions of the libraries and supports their products moving forward ( in fact , .NET does provide this very functionality in the GAC ) .
It is useful that the .NET 1.0 and 1.1 APIs are set in stone now , because we have a concrete goal to aim for , and developers will know that those APIs will be supported .
Also , the CLI makes binary compatibility easier to achieve .
A lot of thought went into the VM and into the C# programming language to deal with versioning problems that arise during the natural life time of a component .
On the VM side , it is possible to add new fields , new methods and rearrange them without suffering ABI breakage .
This is possible because the .NET metadata preserves naming information and binary layouts are only computed on the target processor at installation or JIT time .
People sometimes focus on what would happen if Microsoft changes an API in .NET , how would that impact Mono ?
This is not as much as a problem , given Microsoft 's commitment to keep binary compatibility ;
The major threat to Linux as a development platform is its own development model , mixed with the lack of understanding in many hacker circles that API and ABI binary compatibility are crucial .
Update :
And of course if something like the Linux Standard Base would get a long way to make this happen , but it has never got a lot of buy - in from the actual distributions .
A bomber hit a bank in Kirkuk as soldiers collected their pay
Enlarge Image
Military spokesman Maj Gen William Caldwell said there had been a " disheartening " 22 % rise in attacks in Baghdad since the end of last month .
His comments came as a wave of bombings across Iraq killed at least 41 people .
President George W Bush has said the surge in Iraq may be equivalent to the US experience in the Vietnam War .
Mr Bush acknowledged that the escalation of violence " could be " comparable to the 1968 Tet Offensive against US troops , which helped turn public opinion against the Vietnam War .
But , speaking on ABC News , Mr Bush denied that the rising number of Iraqi and US military deaths in Iraq meant the campaign there was failing .
Deadly month
Launched in June , Operation Together Forward is a joint US and Iraqi security drive in which thousands of extra troops have been deployed in Baghdad .
But Gen Caldwell said attacks on US troops and Iraqi forces in Baghdad has risen significantly in the first three weeks of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan , which began in the last week of September .
" Operation Together Forward has made a difference in the focus areas but it has not met our overall expectations of sustaining a reduction in ... violence , " he said .
Gen Caldwell said 73 US soldiers had been killed so far in October , which was heading towards becoming the deadliest month for US forces in Iraq for two years .
The senior US commander in Iraq , Gen George Casey , has now ordered a review of the strategy .
The gloomy assessment by the US military will add to growing pressure on the Bush administration for some shift in strategy in Iraq , says the BBC's James Westhead in Washington .
But the White House dismissed reports that it was preparing for a change of course , with spokesman Tony Snow describing them as a " bunch of hooey " .
Curfew
The US comments came on another day of violence in Iraq .
In Mosul in the north there were six separate suicide bomb attacks on Thursday alone .
In the deadliest attack , an explosives - laden fuel lorry blew up at a police station in the city .
Civilians bore the brunt of the attack , as many of the casualties were motorists waiting to buy fuel at a nearby petrol station .
Shortly after the blast , insurgents fired mortars and small arms and triggered more explosions in Mosul , killing at least three more people .
The violence prompted authorities to impose a six - hour curfew until calm was restored .
Correspondents say Mosul has witnessed a recent escalation of violence , with Sunni Arab insurgents battling US troops and the Shia - led government in Baghdad .
Attackers also struck in Kirkuk , killing 12 more people and wounding 70 when a car bomber targeted a crowded bank .
The blast tore though a crowd of soldiers who had gathered there to collect their salaries .
Elsewhere , at least 10 people were killed when a roadside bomb ripped through the Shia market town of Khalis .
Meanwhile , police in Baghdad said at least two officers and two passers - by were killed in the south of the city after a double roadside bomb attack on a police patrol .
At 12:01 a.m. Saturday , their fingers will race across the pages of J.K. Rowling 's final Harry Potter installment .
They 'll be dressed – just like Potter – in wizard robes and Hogwarts school uniforms as their fingertips absorb the raised - dot combinations known as braille .
Potter 's much - awaited fate will be revealed to these blind children at Boston 's Midnight Madness party at the National Braille Press ( NBP ) .
It will be a time of celebration , as the party marks only the second time braille readers have had simultaneous access to a new Harry Potter book release .
But these braille - literate children are a clear minority in the blind community .
The NBP estimates that today only 12 percent of 55,000 legally blind children in the United States can read braille – named for founder Frenchman Louis Braille .
Although the number does not account for those cognitively unable to read , the literacy rate is down significantly from 50 percent in the 1960s .
It seems the time , effort , and money it takes to teach children braille is sometimes passed over in favor of less expensive and less time - consuming audio and computer aids .
To many within the blind community , this trend holds serious ramifications .
" [ Literacy ] is the biggest single determinant of a person 's ability to be successful , " says Steven Rothstein , president of Perkins School for the blind in Watertown , Mass .
" If literacy rates had gone down for the general population , there would be a political uproar in this country . "
Mr. Rothstein estimates that braille literacy is closer to 20 percent and considers the decline an " enormous crisis " requiring a civil rights movement for America 's disabled .
According to statistics from the American Foundation for the Blind , only 32 percent of the blind in the US are employed .
But several studies indicate that at least 90 percent of that population who hold jobs are braille literate .
The decline in literacy is generally linked to the 1973 Rehabilitation Act , which mainstreamed blind students into public schools where teachers were often unprepared to teach them .
Today about 85 percent of blind schoolchildren are enrolled in public schools .
According to the National Federation of the Blind , 33 states have enacted bills promoting braille instruction within K - 12 school systems .
NBP vice president Tanya Holton says this " grass - roots " effort began in the late 1980s when blind adults became concerned that American youth were not receiving adequate braille instruction .
She says guardians should be educated about such legislation and prepared to fight for braille education .
Trials in seeking better teaching in schools
Stephen Yerardi , class president of Perkins 's 2004 graduating high school class , soberly recalls his family 's fight for braille education in the New Hampshire public school system when he was 9 .
He says teachers suggested a " life - skills program " with no academic instruction and no hope for college .
" I hated going to school , " Mr. Yerardi says by phone .
" The teachers did n't really understand how to teach me , and they were kind of negative toward me . "
Yerardi says he received braille instruction just twice a week – significantly too little time , he says – from a teacher who mistakenly reversed dot combinations .
" They had no experience teaching a blind student , " he says .
" I was the only person with a physical disability in nine towns . "
At age 13 , Yerardi says school system administrators paid for his instruction at Perkins after coming to the conclusion that they could not provide adequate resources .
Consistent braille and computer instruction at Perkins changed his academic future , he says .
As a dean 's list student at Keene State College where he will be junior this fall , Yerardi reads textbooks using a PAC Mate personal digital assistant with audio instruction and a refreshable braille display .
He plans to teach technology to the blind after he graduates in 2009 .
Technology brings braille to PDAs
The fusion of braille and technology presents an intriguing challenge to the blind community .
Some worry that the growing emphasis to modernize will eliminate braille , but this worry is not evident at the Carroll Center for the Blind in Newton , Mass .
On the last Friday of June , three collegiate students gathered in a small classroom with Brian Charlson , Carroll 's vice president of computer training .
Mr. Charlson praises the technological advances he 's seen during the past decades .
Gone are the days when students had to manually make dot combinations with styluses or Perkins Braillers , the common braille typewriter .
Now students can electronically scan pages and translate them to braille with Duxbury translation software .
They can even print the pages with braille embossers .
Refreshable braille displays with changing dot combinations , sleek voice recorders , and the JAWS computer screen - reading program are just a few options available for blind students .
Charlson points to large volumes of braille books in his office shelves .
The books are expensive to produce because of the thick paper and size requirements , he says .
Unlike print , braille cannot be reduced in size .
So when the Hogwarts aficionados leave the Midnight Madness party early Saturday morning , they each will be toting the 10 braille volumes that make up Potter 's final adventures in " Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows . "
Each set weighs 12 pounds and costs about $ 62 to produce , although the NBP will charge the same price sighted readers will pay for the book in an effort to promote parity .
" When everybody talks about technology killing braille , it 's the other way around , " Charlson says of refreshable braille displays .
" Technology is growing braille , because braille is no longer an issue of size .
It 's still an issue of expense , though . "
All three students in Charlson 's class say their public school districts funded their Carroll technology class .
All know braille , and all have expensive refreshable braille personal digital assistants .
And Charlson says each pupil is an example of how such opportunities are " exclusively " available for students or the employed .
He reiterates that about 70 percent of the blind population is unemployed and will not have access to such expensive technology .
Renn Bailey of Albuquerque , N.M. , enrolled in Charlson 's class to prepare for his freshman year at the University of New Mexico .
The New Mexico Commission for the Blind provided his BrailleNote – a note - taking device with refreshable braille display and audio instruction .
The latest version sells for about $ 6,000 .
" I had a social studies book in audio once , and it was terrible , " he says of his preference for reading rather than listening .
Mr. Bailey 's classmate Danielle Senick of Norwich , Conn. , says she read her first braille book at age 5 .
Ironically , the book was about the man who changed blind literacy and opened the door to her education .
" I remember sitting out on the porch at this family gathering and everyone was like , ' Read us a book , ' " says Ms. Senick , a soon - to - be freshman at Curry College in Milton , Mass .
" So I read them this book about Louis Braille .
I 've used braille a lot ... for pleasure , for education .
I just feel I 'd be lost if I did n't know how to read it . "
The one photo the GOP does not want anyone to see was snapped at yesterday 's NAACP GOP Presidential Candidate Forum .
The NAACP invited all 9 Republican candidates to the forum , but only one showed up : Tom Tancredo .
All the Democratic Presidential hopefuls showed up for their forum .
The excuses given by the Republican campaigns mostly had to do with scheduling conflicts -- just too busy to make it .
The resulting photo of Tancredo -- standing on a stage of empty podiums -- sums up the Republican party 's commitment to civil rights in America : the only Republican interested is the guy running to deny immigrant workers their rights .
One has to wonder why this photo was not the lead on every morning show and on the front pages of every morning newspaper in America .
The reason , most likely , is a coordinated effort by Republicans to pressure news agencies to downplay the obvious implications of having 8 out of 9 of their Presidential candidates as " no shows " for a debate at the NAACP .
What is keeping the obvious story about Republicans and racism out of today 's headlines ?
David Beckham 's arrival in Hollywood .
This is an ideal moment to stand up and demand the kind of news coverage we want in America .
Contact your local TV stations and newspapers .
Ask them to run this photo and to write an article about Republicans , civil rights and racism .
Like Pattern Recognition before it , William Gibson 's eighth novel , Spook Country , feels like dictation from the zeitgeist .
Its " illegal facilitators , " nonexistent magazines , terrorists , pirates , junkies , mad art dealers , and WMD are all woven together into something more unsettling and blackly comic than anything he 's done before .
Gibson and I started talking in 2004 , shortly before meeting in person while I was in Vancouver working on a doomed TV pilot based on my comic book series Global Frequency .
At the time , he disclosed that near - future events would determine whether Spook Country would be comedy or horror .
We 've stayed in touch electronically ever since , and when wired asked me to talk to him about the book , set for release in August , we picked up right where we left off .
Wired : So , comedy or horror ?
Gibson : I think it turned out to be satirical , which is what comedy best aspires to in tragic times .
I can't make a narrative up beforehand , can't write before I start typing , so I literally do n't decide what a story is or where it goes .
Wired : I was surprised to see Hubertus Bigend from Pattern show up .
It made me wonder if that novel and Spook are consciously building to form your third trilogy .
Gibson :
You know , I 've never wanted to write a trilogy .
I tacked that " He never saw Molly again " on the end of Neuromancer to indicate no sequel was to be expected .
The fact that I 've done it twice now ...
Well , it seems to be one result of my " method . "
I was n't suspecting H.B. either , for the longest time , but then it became apparent that Node , the shadowy magazine startup , was way Bigendian .
Wired :
One of the details that leaped out at me was the Adidas GSG9 , named for the German counterterrorism squad .
I felt certain you 'd invented the shoe , but then I Googled it .
Gibson : The Adidas GSG9s were the obvious choice for the thinking man 's ninja .
Nothing I could make up could resonate in the same way .
There 's code in name - checking the GSG9 history — esoteric meaning .
Something that started with Pattern Recognition was that I †discovered I could Google the world of the novel .
I began to regard it as a sort of extended text — hypertext pages hovering just outside the printed page .
There have been threads on my Web site — readers Googling and finding my footprints .
I still get people asking me about " the possibilities of interactive fiction , " and they seem to have no clue how we 're already so there .

Barclays is attempting to raise enough finance to take over ABN
If it succeeds and if Barclays acquires ABN , the Chinese state would emerge with a shareholding of around 7 % in the enlarged group .
The Asian cash will be used to help Barclays increase its takeover bid for ABN to around £ 50bn .
A group led by Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ) is also vying for the Dutch firm .
Overseas investment
Banking sources have said that Barclays ' Asian deal was being negotiated overnight .
A smaller stake of about 3 % would be taken by Temasek , the investment arm of the Singaporean government .
If Barclays fails to buy ABN , the newly formed Chinese investment authority and Temasek would take smaller stakes in the British bank .
The Chinese and the Singaporeans are paying around 740 p per Barclays share , above its closing market price on Friday night of 713.5p .
Ambitious
The deal was arranged by the leading US private equity house , Blackstone - which recently sold a £ 1.5 bn stake in itself to the Chinese state .
The Chinese state has $ 1.2 trillion of foreign exchange reserves to invest , much of which has been placed in US Treasuries or government bonds .
China recently signalled it would be taking a more imaginative and aggressive approach to how it invests hundreds of millions of dollars , including buying significant holdings in overseas companies .
The deal with Barclays under negotiation would be the most ambitious manifestation to date of its new boldness as an investor .
The idea that the Chinese government could end up with an influential stake in such an important European financial institution as the merged Barclays / ABN could prove controversial .
Some Barclays shareholders may be concerned that the Chinese are buying the shares without them being offered to existing shareholders .
Barclays will also announce that it will buy in several billion pounds of its own shares .
KABUL , Afghanistan , June 18 — Seven children were killed during an airstrike by the American - led coalition against a religious compound thought to be an Al Qaeda sanctuary in remote eastern Afghanistan , the coalition reported today .
The death of the children , tragic enough by itself , may well add to the growing anger many Afghans feel about civilian casualties from American and NATO military operations .
More than 130 civilians have been killed in such airstrikes and shootings in just the last six months , according to Afghan officials .
“ We are truly sorry for the innocent lives lost in this attack , ” Maj .
Chris Belcher of the United States Army said of Sunday ’s raid against several structures , including a school and mosque , in Paktika Province , near the border with Pakistan .
“ We had surveillance on the compound all day and saw no indications there were children inside the building . ”
There are more than 50,000 foreign troops operating in Afghanistan , the bulk of them American .
One NATO soldier and two Afghan policemen died today during heavy fighting that killed “ a large number of enemy extremist fighters ” in Uruzgan Province in the south of the country , according to a NATO news release .
Mrs Patil 's backers say her election will be a boost to women
Mrs Patil , 72 , won nearly two - thirds of votes cast in state assemblies and in India 's parliament , they said .
The former governor of the northern Indian state of Rajasthan described her win as " a victory of the people " .
Mrs Patil 's supporters say her election to the largely ceremonial role will be a boost to millions of Indian women .
The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder , in Delhi , says that while some see her victory as an important step towards gender equality in India , many view it as only a symbolic gesture .
Millions of women in India face discrimination and poverty often linked to age - old traditions which require the parents of a bride to pay a large dowry to the family of her eventual husband .
Women 's landmark
Mrs Patil emerged as a surprise , last - minute candidate after left - wing parties in the Congress - led coalition opposed the Congress Party 's first choice .
She was backed by Congress leader Sonia Gandhi , but was mocked by opponents and by some sections of India 's media .
This is a victory for the principles which our Indian people uphold
Pratibha Patil
Profile : Pratibha Patil
But Mrs Gandhi , the Congress Party leader , hailed her candidate 's win .
" In the 60th year of our independence , for the first time we have a woman president , " she said .
" I am grateful to the people of India and the men and women of India and this is a victory for the principles which our Indian people uphold , " the Reuters news agency quoted Mrs Patil as saying after her victory was confirmed .
There was also support at a hostel Mrs Patil established in Mumbai , in her home state of Maharashtra .
" It is encouraging for other women who want to step out of their homes and make something out of their careers or do something in the world , " said one resident , Priya Mehra .
Balancing role
Mrs Patil has courted controversy , recently telling a Muslim congregation that the veil was introduced to protect their women from Mughal invaders , a comment she later retracted .
She also faced allegations that a bank she helped set up gave out cheap loans to her relatives before it folded up .
The Congress Party has rejected those allegations and was highly critical of the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) - led opposition candidate , Vice - President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat , an 83 - year - old party veteran .
The presidency is largely a ceremonial post , but plays a key role with a fragmented electorate often throwing up precariously placed coalition governments .
Around 4,500 MPs and state legislators were eligible to vote in the election .
Mrs Patil will succeed A P J Abdul Kalam , a popular missile scientist , as president .
A new analysis of behaviour in a structured population illuminates Darwin ’s theories of co-operation and competition between kin , and provides an abstract model that could simplify scientists ’ quest to map behaviour among disease - causing organisms within a cell .
The study by Queen ’s Mathematics and Statistics professor Peter Taylor , and co-authors Troy Day ( Queen ’s ) and Geoff Wild ( University of Western Ontario ) presents a simple formula for balancing the benefit and cost in altruistic acts , allowing researchers to predict behaviour and summarize disparate results in a simple framework .
“ Although our main focus is on cooperation , these graph - theoretic relationships can apply to the evolution of other traits , ” says Dr. Taylor .
For example , at Queen ’s we are particularly interested in the behaviour of pathogens competing within a host , in their capacity to cause disease , and we expect applications of our results to these models . ”
The study titled Evolution of cooperation in a finite homogeneous graph is published in Nature .
It provides a system that can be applied to any species within its natural environment to gain an understanding of its behaviour and interactions .
“ One can imagine interacting individuals playing a game , ” says Dr. Taylor .
“ With fitness determined by the game payoffs and the competition between offspring for space , our model predicts which strategies will emerge under the forces of evolution . ”
The research was funded by NSERC ’s program of discovery grants .
DIGG THIS
Toward the end of the American Revolutionary War ( 1775 — 1783 ) , the 13 colonies joined together under the Articles of Confederation ( 1781 — 1788 ) , which was succeeded by the U.S. Constitution in 1788 .
The Constitution created the Federal government and the United States of America .
Several of the Founding Fathers ( John Jay , James Madison , and Alexander Hamilton ) in 1787 — 1788 launched a campaign to get the new Constitution adopted by the 13 states .
Their essays , collected in the Federalist Papers , contain powerful and persuasive arguments by writers who were skilled users of rhetoric .
The Federalist Papers helped launch the ship of American state on its voyage .
The entire country went along for the ride .
The course adopted at the outset is the same course we are still on .
Arguments expressed in the Federalist Papers are still made today .
Sentiments they expressed still persuade Americans today that they need a central government with appreciable powers .
Looking back , we can now see that very little time passed before the ship ’s motion revealed its course was opposite the hope represented by " life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . "
Section 2 of the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 , for example , imposed a fine of up to $ 2,000 and a sentence of up to 2 years in jail for anyone convicted of uttering , writing , printing or assisting in causing to be produced speech that brought any arm of the Federal government into " contempt or disrepute " or to " excite against them … the hatred of the good people of the United States . "
The American ship of state early on began to run into tyrannical waters and it still does .
It has often instituted laws ( with approving majorities ) that decimate the rights of not only large minorities but also majorities of the American people .
Logic suggests that if we are on the wrong course and if the Federalist Papers helped to establish that course , then there must be incorrect argumentation in the Federalist Papers .
Our Founding Fathers must have presented false rationales .
If we are on the wrong track , then we need to go back and re-examine the launching to understand why we have gone so far off course .
We will find that important presumptions in the Federalist Papers are entirely false and wrong .
We will find cases where the persuasive rhetoric of its writers has substituted for wisdom and truth .
The adoption of false ideas gives rise to destructive and counterproductive policies .
The tragedy is that we are following these policies to this day .
The presumptions of the Federalist Papers are a part of American culture , passed on and inculcated in endless ways to each succeeding generation .
This article focuses on Federalist # 2 in order to point out the false ideas in it that are giving us trouble today .
Coercive government assumed
John Jay begins with : " Nothing is more certain than the indispensable necessity of government … " True .
Government , in the sense of upholding natural rights , is indispensable to a society .
" … and it is equally undeniable , that whenever and however it is instituted , the people must cede to it some of their natural rights in order to vest it with requisite powers . "
False .
Jay assumes that all government must be coercive government , run and administered by a coercive state .
He means that all people must allow themselves to be taxed and interfered with , in order to achieve some ends .
He does not acknowledge the possibility of self - government within an order of market anarchism .
In the latter , people do not cede natural rights .
But , for the sake of evaluating his arguments , let us stipulate along with Jay that we shall have such a coercive government .
Let us ignore the many questions that arise such as : How can such a government be instituted without unanimous consent ?
How can it be legally binding on new voters and new generations ?
What powers shall it have ?
How shall they be limited ?
Jay then poses two alternatives : separate confederacies or one national government , " each [ with ] the same kind of powers . "
He unnecessarily assumes away many other possible alternatives including no sovereignties at all .
Jay goes on to present arguments in favor of a single central government .
Prosperity linked to government
Argument 1 : Continuing American prosperity depends on the people being united under one government .
False .
He is referring in part to the fact that the people united to end British rule and to create the Articles , but he is also making a general argument .
But even if winning the war required coordination of American forces , prosperity does not require like coordination under a single central political leadership .
Political coordination or centralization requires the exercise of political power , and this goes beyond maintaining individual rights .
It involves taxing , regulating , tariffs , drafting , printing money , giving away land , subsidizing enterprises , military ventures , transfer payments , etc .
Such exercises of power necessarily harm some persons to benefit others , and this must cause a diminishment of overall prosperity by altering incentives to produce , by introducing property rights uncertainty , and by establishing rivalries to utilize the power for private ends .
A monopolized political power is especially dangerous in its propensity to expand and be used to tyrannize .
Prosperity is the result of peaceful pursuits .
It has several roots , one of the most important of which is private property rights .
A culture of respect for property rights creates an atmosphere of trust , security , and fair dealing , all of which lower the costs of trade and production and enhance prosperity .
A united central government , by Jay ’s own admission , diminishes such rights at the outset by people ’s ceding some rights .
Subsequently , unless restrained , such a government can infringe rights and thus decrease prosperity .
And how is one to restrain a monopoly government ?
One is likely to observe such a government grow , as has occurred in our history and in the history of many countries .
Today , whenever politicians recount how well off Americans are , what a great country this is , and how advanced our civilization is , and then go on to link these with the American system , the nation , democracy , the federal government or related political constructs , they are making Jay ’s argument anew .
Jay wrote " that the prosperity of the people of America depended on their continuing firmly united " and " under one federal government . "
The U.S. Department of State , writing about John Hay ’s Open Door policy of 1899 writes : " Americans dreamed of building prosperity at home through trade with China .
To achieve this political leaders and businessmen assumed that China needed to be stable , unified , and open to international commerce . "
Jay ’s seed sprouted into the notion that it was up to America and European powers to assure prosperity by uniting China under a single ( friendly ) government .
Here was sown a conflict with Japan that ultimately brought on Pearl Harbor and World War II !
It is no distance whatever to the notion that Middle Eastern oil is crucial to American national security and prosperity .
I quote from the November , 2005 White House ( National Security Council ) policy document titled " National Strategy for Victory in Iraq " as follows : " Ceding ground to terrorists in one of the world ’s most strategic regions will threaten the world ’s economy and America ’s security , growth , and prosperity , for decades to come . "
Is this war about terrorism ?
Only peripherally .
According to our government , it is about American prosperity , American wealth , American growth , and American profits .
Jay saw American prosperity as a function of the 13 states being under one government .
Hay saw American prosperity as being a function of China being under one unified government .
The National Security Council sees American prosperity as a function of Iraq being under a democratic government .
It lays out its strategy for " Helping the Iraqi people defeat the terrorists and build an inclusive democratic state . "
Americans now believe not only that prosperity and one central government ( democracy ) are linked , but that American prosperity justifies extending this linkage to foreign lands in the same way that it was extended to the American continent .
The idea of prosperity under one government has become more virulent , more expansive , and more dangerous .
It leads to great wars .
American expansionism is happening under the confused guise of a war on terrorism .
The Iraq War reflects ( among other things ) how Americans think about prosperity and government .
This is how they have thought for a long time , and this is a fundamental error in their thinking .
Today President Bush says : " The advances of free markets and trade and democracy and rule of law have brought prosperity to an ever - widening circle of people in this world . "
Again we see prosperity identified with government , a single government now being taken for granted .
Bush ’s statement carries the rhetorical confusions even further than Jay’s .
He falsely mingles government ( today called democracy ) with free markets and trade .
Governments today do not allow free markets and trade ; they vigorously regulate them .
And the rule of law has come to mean ( among other things ) , not that natural law is supreme , but that the legal system should operate impartially even if the laws are unjust .
Jay ’s argument , heard today , confuses the prosperity that arises from property rights with the central government ’s existence .
An airplane flying against prevailing winds flies because it burns fuel , not because it encounters these headwinds .
And the stronger the winds are , the more difficult the flight .
A cynic might say that the goal of this confusion is to identify a beneficial institution ( private property rights ) that brings prosperity with the government , that is , with a parasitic institution that destroys rights and prosperity .
This may be so .
But whether or not Jay , Hay , Bush , and many others in American history believed what they were saying is not the central issue .
What is central is that identifying prosperity with a unified government is incorrect .
In the case of the United Nations , the idea is enshrined in the notion that the earth needs to be divided up among monopoly states with fixed boundaries .
In the case of the U.S. , the ever - expanding application of this notion attempts to lead in one direction , which is a unified world government under American control .
The attempt will fail as all such prior attempts have failed .
Geography
Argument 2 : America is one country or one land that is geographically suited to being ruled by one government .
False .
Jay appeals to a romantic notion of a land in which Providence has given its people natural water boundaries .
However , the Holy Bible makes no reference to America ; and natural boundaries are in the eye of the beholder .
Furthermore , even if America did have a single natural - looking geography , it does not follow that it should have a single government over it all .
If this principle operated throughout the globe , what would become of a native people inhabiting an area that another country thought should be annexed because the geography suggested it should be ?
Where is the justice in such a principle ?
This argument was an elastic one that eventually was used in praise of the American expansionary drive , northwards , southwards and westwards .
God had made the Mississippi River for America to expand to .
Then we realized the Rocky Mountains had been made for that purpose .
Then we realized , no , God had created the Pacific Ocean as a boundary .
And that was not correct either .
We were supposed to reach across the Pacific to the shores of Asia .
Meanwhile , if Florida was next to Georgia , should n’t Florida be part of the country ?
And after reaching the Rio Grande , why not incorporate Mexico ?
There was a brief " all Mexico " movement around 1847 .
Why not Cuba and the Caribbean Islands ?
Why should n’t President Monroe declare South America off limits to European powers ?
Unity
Argument 3 : America has one people as well as one country , as if by Providential design .
" Providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people … "
Therefore , it should have one government .
False .
This argument is powerful because of its religious overtones : " What therefore God hath joined together , let not man put asunder . " ( Mark 10:9 ) .
It is powerful because of the appeal to unity .
A powerful Nazi slogan was " Ein Volk , ein Reich , ein Führer , " ( one people , one empire , one leader . )
Appeals to unity , which are common from American politicians of all stripes , tap into the most basic fears of us vs. them and order vs. chaos .
The appeal to unity is related to the idea that God blessed America , as one nation , under God , indivisible .
Jay invoked the fear of a " band of brethren " being " split into a number of unsocial , jealous , and alien sovereignties . "
But why should Americans have conceived of unusual enmities when they had every incentive to prosper by cooperation ?
Why should a rights - loving people divide into warring sovereignties ?
Would one state try to conquer the rest ?
This might happen , but there was no intimation that it would ; and the costs of such maneuvers would be very high .
Jay would be the last person , of course , to mention that the central government might itself cause such splits , or magnify them , leading perhaps to civil wars .
In Jay ’s words , Americans were " a people descended from the same ancestors , speaking the same language , professing the same religion , attached to the same principles of government , very similar in their manners and customs , and who , by their joint counsels , arms , and efforts , fighting side by side throughout a long and bloody war , have nobly established general liberty and independence . "
All of these commonalities make it easier for people to govern themselves without a central authority .
By contrast , a central government would increase the chance that a party or a clique would attempt to make its voice and opinions the predominant ones in the land .
The chances of civil war would be enhanced .
Furthermore , the items that Jay recites as uniting Americans ( language , religion , manners , and customs ) exist prior to any political state and they require no central government for their existence or preservation .
They are social , not political , matters .
In truth , Americans could still be Americans , even if they lived in 50 separate states , as they now do .
Defects in the Articles of Confederation
Argument 4 : The Articles of Confederation brought a valued union and therefore that union should be preserved .
The Articles are " greatly deficient , " partly because they were drawn up under trying conditions of war when their composers could not think straight .
The people perceived these defects and convened the Constitutional Convention .
Now therefore is the time to perfect them .
Nearly all of these statements are false .
Jay is a very clever debater .
He wants to have his cake and eat it too by arguing that the Articles brought a valuable union , yet should be discarded because they are defective .
In this way , he wraps the halo of the Articles , union , and continuity around what is really a bald assertion that the country should have union under a new and strong central government .
And he slides over the fact that whatever union the Articles brought was not the kind of union promised under the new Constitution .
It is true that the country experienced economic problems while the Articles were in effect , but it had experienced such troubles before and has felt them many times thereafter under the Constitution .
We had a Constitution during the Great Depression .
Economic problems are frequently the result of the misuses and misdeeds of political actions upon such matters as currency , banking , taxes , tariffs , war , and regulations .
Scott Trask and others have argued that the Articles were not responsible for the post - war deflation and recessionary economy , these being the aftereffect of inflationary wartime finance .
Nor , as historian Charles Beard has shown , was the Convention called upon popular demand of the people .
Jay ’s storytelling is pure spin .
Authority of wise men
Argument 5 : The Constitution should be accepted because it is the product of " minds unoccupied with other subjects " who have " passed many months in cool , uninterrupted , and daily consultation ; and finally , without having been awed by power , or influenced by any passions except love for their country , they presented and recommended to the people the plan produced by their joint and very unanimous councils . "
The Secret Proceedings and Debates of the Constitutional Convention 1787 makes hash out of this depiction .
See also Gary North .
In any event , this is an argument to accept the authority of wise and virtuous men .
Jay bemoans a prior case , the Congress of 1774 , whose measures met with disapproval : " … yet it is fresh in our memories how soon the press began to teem with pamphlets and weekly papers against those very measures . "
Yet , he relates , the wisdom of the American people prevailed in supporting the Congressional measures .
And with even more wise grey hairs at the helm , the public has " still greater reason … now to respect the judgment and advice of the convention … "
Jay again wants his cake and eat it too , for he simultaneously mentions that he is neither recommending " blind approbation " nor " blind reprobation . "
He is asking that people make up their own minds while placing the largest weight on the authority of those who wrote the Constitution .
Conclusion
Jay closes Federalist # 2 by returning to its most important argument : " not only the first , but every succeeding Congress , as well as the late convention , have invariably joined with the people in thinking that the prosperity of America depended on its Union . "
He proposes in succeeding papers to explain why the " cause of the Union rests on great and weighty reasons . "
There have been all sorts of " Unions " in this world since Jay wrote Federalist # 2 .
There has been the Soviet Union .
There has been the German Empire .
There is the People ’s Republic of China .
There are hundreds of peoples united in the political unions we call nation - states .
Some have prospered .
A great many have not .
Some have failed miserably , in fact , those with the strongest unions , the totalitarian states , have come to the greatest grief and inflicted enormous damage on their own and other peoples .
We should have learned by now that political union does not assure prosperity , nor is political union a necessary condition to gain prosperity .
The same goes if we substitute the words democracy or socialism for political union .
Indeed , political union provides the state with powers that it uses to undermine prosperity .
Yet we have not learned this .
The long - lived myth that prosperity and union are one lives on in an even more deadly form .
Today we are told that American prosperity demands democracy everywhere on earth .
These are not mere words meant to cover up other motives that may also be operative .
These words reflect ideas that took root here in America hundreds of years ago and that have now spread everywhere and are reflected in major institutions like the U.N .
Jay was wrong .
The prosperity of America does not depend on its Union , that is , on a Federal government .
The opposite is true .
The Federal government sabotages prosperity .
It does this because it sabotages property rights .
Bush is wrong .
America ’s prosperity ( and security ) do not depend on creating new democracies or perfecting the imperfect ones that everywhere prevail .
The correct concept is this : Prosperity depends on private property rights .
The Best of Michael S. Rozeff
House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers has said that if three more Congress Members get behind impeachment he will start the impeachment proceedings .
I was a guest today on Bree Walker 's radio show .
She 's the progressive radio host from San Diego who purchased Cindy Sheehan 's land from her in Crawford , Texas .
Bree attended an event on Friday in San Diego at which Congressman Conyers spoke about impeachment .
Her report was extremely interesting .
I had already heard reports that Conyers had said : " What are we waiting for ?
Let 's take these two guys out ! "
But , of course , what we 're waiting for is John Conyers .
Is he ready to act ?
It was hard to tell from that comment .
In January , Conyers spoke at a huge rally on the National Mall and declared " We can fire them ! " but later explained that what he meant was that we could wait for two years and Bush and Cheney 's terms would end .
Was this week 's remark just more empty rhetoric ?
It appears to be more than that .
Bree Walker told me , on the air , that Conyers said that all he needs is three more Congress Members backing impeachment , and he 'll move on it , even without Pelosi .
I asked whether that meant specifically moving from 14 cosponsors of H Res 333 to 17 , or adding 3 to the larger number of Congress Members who have spoken favorably of impeachment but not all signed onto bills .
Bree said she did n't know and that Conyers had declined to take any questions .
Either way , this target of three more members seems perfectly doable .
It 's safe to assume , I think , that we 're talking about impeaching Cheney first .
But , even if Conyers is talking about Bush , the target is perfectly achievable .
First , there are Congress Members like Jesse Jackson Jr. who have spoken out for impeachment but not signed onto H Res 333 .
They should be urged to act now !
Second , there are dozens of members who signed onto H Res 635 a year and a half ago , Conyers ' bill for an investigation into grounds for impeachment , who have not signed onto H Res 333 yet .
Third , one of the excuses citizens often hear from lots of Congress Members for not signing onto articles of impeachment is that not enough of their colleagues have signed on and therefore " we do n't have the votes . "
Well that just changed .
Now three more votes is all that 's needed to get this machine rolling .
Fourth , many of the 14 Congress Members backing H Res 333 have used similar excuses to justify refraining from lobbying their colleagues to join them .
That can now end .
Our 14 leaders can do more than just put down their names .
Now , if Conyers begins impeachment proceedings in the House Judiciary Committee , we should all be clear on what that will mean .
If it is serious , it will not mean sending any subpoenas or contempt citations to the emperors ' court .
Bush and Cheney have already repeatedly refused to comply with subpoenas .
President Richard Nixon did the same , of course , and his refusal to comply with subpoenas constituted the offense cited in one of the three Articles of Impeachment approved by the House Judiciary Committee on July 27 , 1974 as warranting " impeachment and trial , and removal from office . "
But Bush and Cheney have gone further , ordering former staffers not to comply with subpoenas , and announcing that the Justice Department will not enforce any contempt of Congress proceedings .
What the impeachment of Cheney or Bush will be is very , very fast .
It will not disrupt or distract from the important business of passing nonbinding resolutions and holding all - night gripe sessions over bills destined to be vetoed .
Impeachment in the case of Dick Cheney need not take the three months it did for Nixon or the two months it did for President Bill Clinton .
In fact , it could take a day .
Here 's why :
Bush and Cheney 's lies about Iraqi ties to al Qaeda are on videotape and in writing , and Bush and Cheney continue to make them to this day .
There was no al Qaeda in Iraq until the invasion .
Their claims about Iraqi weapons have been shown in every detail to have been , not mistakes , but lies .
Their threats to Iran are on videotape .
Bush being warned about Katrina and claiming he was not are on videotape .
Bush lying about illegal spying and later confessing to it are on videotape .
A federal court has ruled that spying to be a felony .
The Supreme Court has ruled Bush and Cheney 's system of detentions unconstitutional .
Torture , openly advocated for by Bush and Cheney and their staffs , is documented by victims , witnesses , and public photographs .
Torture was always illegal and has been repeatedly recriminalized under Bush and Cheney .
Bush has reversed laws with signing statements .
A fresh class action lawsuit charges Apple 's iTunes , major online music shops , and top record labels with performing an end - run around a musician 's permission and his royalty payments .
Dawg Music , a relatively small label run by bluegrass musician ( and former collaborator with Jerry Garcia ) David Grisman as well as his business partner Craig Miller , is accusing those that carry Grisman 's catalog of knowingly selling his works with sometimes poor or nonexistent compensation , and without his consent .
Filed in its most recent form on May 3rd by the Law Offices of Jeffery L. Graubart and represented by Strange and Carpenter , the suit makes a two - part complaint that implicates both labels and their online store partners .
Two of the largest record producers in the industry , Universal Music Group and Warner Music , are alleged to have neglected Dawg Music 's copyrights and royalties when signing deals with major online services .
In effect , the two music giants are said to have agreed to online distribution of Grisman 's library without first asking the permission of Dawg Music , which owns the copyrights .
By doing so , Universal and Warner have not only made unauthorized hard copies of the music but have also usurped control of the royalties due for each album : the lack of communication has meant " gross underpayments " of the expected dues , Dawg Music says in the 26 - page filing .
Online stores are guilty by association , according to the complaint .
The suit claims that in addition to Apple 's iTunes , seven other outlets — AOL Music Now , Buy.com , Microsoft's MSN.com , Napster , RealNetworks '
Rhapsody , Wal - Mart.com , and Yahoo Music — are also culpable by agreeing to host and sell the unsanctioned copies from their servers .
While all eight pay royalties on the music in question , the failures by Universal and Warner to land specific online contracts have resulted in the direct - download services trading songs without genuine consent ; money is sent to the intermediate labels , not the copyright holders .
Sidestepping the copyrights this way has caused " irreparable injury " to Dawg Music , the suit alleges , and will continue to inflict damage as long as the present - day contracts for online music remain in place .
Most of the blame lay at the labels ' feet for both infringing on copyright and for leading the online services to commit accidental infringement ; but all the targets of the lawsuit , including Apple , would have to compensate Dawg Music should it win its battle in the central California court hearing the case .
The reparations could be comparatively severe for a royalty case .
Although the plaintiffs hope to use their time in court to prove the damages and missed profits they expect to receive , the alternative remedy would have each defendant pay $ 150,000 for every work whose copyright was violated — resulting in millions of dollars spread across the involved defendants .
For a successful case , however , the attorneys will have to prove that none of the existing clauses in Dawg Music 's agreements with Universal and Warner already cover the online distribution at the heart of the matter .
When contacted by AppleInsider , however , representing attorney Brian Strange declined elaborating on the claims .
It is too bad that conservatives , conservative intellectuals in particular are not capable of stepping back and appreciating the irony of the swill they write .
Paragon of conservative intellectuals Bill Kristol writes about convicted felon I. Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby ,
“ I FEEL TERRIBLE for Scooter Libby ’s family .
Millions of Americans feel terrible for Scooter Libby ’s family .
But we ca n’t do anything about the injustice that has been done .
Nor can we do anything to avert a further injustice looming on the horizon–Judge Reggie Walton seems inclined not to let Libby remain free pending appeal .
Unlike the rest of us , however , George W. Bush is president .
Article II , Section Two of the Constitution gives him the pardon power .
George W. Bush can do something to begin to make up for the injustice a prosecutor appointed by his own administration brought down on Scooter Libby .
And he can do something to avert the further injustice of a prison term .
Well certainly there has been an injustice .
Libby was a high ranking lieutenant and helped George Bush , Dick Cheney and Karl Rove carry out a hit on former Ambassador Joesph Wilson and a high ranking CIA covert operative who was an expert on weapons of mass destruction .
Libby lied and was convicted of those lies because George , Dick and Karl did n’t have the moral courage to step up and tell America and the court the details of their involvement .
Libby ’s problems would n’t disappear tomorrow if the major players in the Bush administration , the players Libby lied to protect came forward , but it is n’t a great leap to assume that he might receive a lighter sentence .
We ’re not going to see that happen because the three stooges George , Dick and Karl have been smirking moral cowards their entire lives – they used Libby to keep from being exposed for what they are .
For them honor is just a five letter word and they probably can’t even spell accountability .
“ I regard him as among the most gifted and valuable public servants of his generation , ” wrote Norman Podhoretz , the former editor of conservative opinion journal Commentary .
“ I find it inconceivable that a man of his sterling character , who is also famous for his lawyerly scrupulousness , could deliberately have told lies to a grand jury , or for that matter to anyone else . ”
Norm , yet another conservative intellectual thinks Scooter was one of the most gifted public servants of our time .
If you consider taking a hit for the Bush team so that the ones that are truly guilty and benefited the most from Libby ’s lies a valuable servant that is true , but not the public servant part .
Libby served his masters , not the nation , not the public and certainly not the common good .
wrote Francis Fukuyama , a prominent foreign - policy thinker .
“ To the contrary , in my discussions with him on issues from Middle East diplomacy to his work on the Cox Commission to the Iraq war , he has always been open to different views and notably without rancor . ”
Note the WaPo does n’t identify Fukuyama as neocon who ’s views of how to handle foreign policy in the middle - east helped pave the way for the Iraq debacle .
“ Sadly I believe that Mr. Libby ’s premature departure from the Administration has been a major reason for the downward spiral of the situation in Iraq and the consuming mess in which we find ourselves today regarding that country , ” he wrote .
If Libby had n’t been caught up in his lies on behalf of his friends in the administration Iraq would look like Pasadena on a Sunday afternoon in early fall .
If he was so valuable how come Cheney has n’t stepped forward to admit his lies so that Scooter could save Iraq .
Whatever these people are , they are not mature rational adults .
Their loyalty first and last is the Conservative Movement , not America .
Ultimately that is why the Right is blowing a fuse today because no act of betrayal really counts when it is done on behalf of the cause – Notes From the Libby Sentencing
The modern Republican party is built on the construct that all government is bad , and once in power they set about bringing into fruition this self - fulfilling prophecy with ruthless efficiency .
They destroy everything they touch , but they are very good at what they are good at : PR , partisan politics and preserving their own power .
From where they stand , from where Scooter stands , there is no culpability in anything done in the service of this , and Scooter was just doing his job .
For the Right the job , the Cause is greater then America , greater then the law .
The Cause has and will continue to be the Right ’s priority , America and its democratic ideals are just excess baggage , bastard children they ’d rather ignore .
Bloomberg On JFK Plot : ‘ Stop Worrying , Get A Life ’
“ There are lots of threats to you in the world .
There ’s the threat of a heart attack for genetic reasons .
You ca n’t sit there and worry about everything .
Get a life , ” he said .
Bloomberg is a Republican and the mayor of city number one on any terror list , yet he manages to have a little perspective .
The right - wing blogs and pundits are upset because putting things in their proper perspective is a road block in the all fear all the time agenda .
Tallying Bush Progress on Democracy or Georgie gets a report card and racks up a perfect “ F ” .
IRAQ
By every measure , the occupation has been a catastrophe .
With at least 70,000 civilians killed , 2 million refugees , a civil war , dismemberment physical , economic and social across the land , it ’s foolhardy to still say the invasion was worth it , or that lengthening American involvement there will improve the situation .
AFGHANISTAN
Briefly thought a model of anti-terrorism conquest and reconstruction under NATO ’s protection , the country is increasingly looking like Iraq .
The Taliban controls entire provinces .
Opium production , which fuels Taliban and terrorist activities , is at record highs .
Various members of NATO contributing troops there —
Germany , France , Canada and the Netherlands among them — are rethinking their role .
NATO itself risks becoming the irrelevant auxiliary of American foreign policy .
If only they ’d let Super Scooter out of jail he ’d have this whole mess cleaned up in no time .

Patrick J. Buchanan
August 12 2002
To see members of Congress smiling behind President Bush , as he signed the " fast track " law by which Capitol Hill surrenders all rights to amend trade treaties , is to understand the new realities of power in this city .
We have a Congress that recoils from responsibility .
The great congresses of Webster , Clay and Calhoun , which held this nation together , are history .
No longer the first branch of government that the Founding Fathers intended , Congress today ranks in power and influence beneath the president and Supreme Court , and even beneath the U.S. bureaucracy and national press .
At the Constitutional Convention , the framers entrusted Congress , and it alone , with the power to take this nation into war .
They wanted nothing to do with Caesarism .
Yet , since his " axis - of - evil " address , President Bush has threatened war , planned war , prepared for war , promised war .
He has so committed us to destroying Iraq that the United States will suffer a humiliating loss of credibility if he now fails .
Yet , for six months , Congress has cravenly abdicated its duty to stand up and say to a president hell - bent on war , " Sir , you do not have the authority to take us into war . "
Across America , questions are being raised that Congress refuses to ask of the president 's War Cabinet .
What was Iraq 's act of aggression against us that justifies war ?
How many troops will be needed to ensure the defeat and occupation of Iraq ?
Will we have to call up the reserves ?
How many casualties can we expect ?
Who will be at America 's side on the road to Baghdad ?
How does the president intend to pay for a war that could cost $ 100 billion ?
Raise taxes ?
What will be the effect on the U.S. economy ?
The world economy ?
How long do we intend to occupy Baghdad ?
What do we do if the Kurds exploit the chaos to declare independence ?
Help crush the Kurds ?
What do we do if Iran encourages the Iraqi Shi'ites to rise up , and they declare independence ?
What do we do if occupied Iraq turns into another Beirut , with U.S. troops daily subjected to sniper fire and suicide attacks ?
Are we confident that in a second Gulf War the " Arab Street " will not succeed where it failed in the first , in overturning one or more of our allies  in Jordan , Egypt , Saudi Arabia or among the Gulf states ?
What will be the impact on nuclear - armed Pakistan ?
In 1990 , Iraq was the aggressor and the president 's father had the support of every neighbor - nation , save Iran and Jordan .
We had the U.N. Security Council behind us , the entire Arab world , a united NATO , and the commitment of Japan and Germany to underwrite the war .
We had the use of all bases in Saudi Arabia .
Yet , even then , President Bush won the vote for war only by the narrowest of margins in the U.S. Senate .
This time , the Arab world is united against an attack on Iraq .
Saudi Arabia will not let us use its bases .
Germany 's chancellor wants no part of the president 's " adventure . "
Outside of Tony Blair  and his support is tepid  NATO enthusiasm is invisible .
Not only is the U.S. government divided , depending on which paper you read , the U.S. military is divided over the wisdom and necessity of this war .
Even the national security adviser to the first President Bush , a co-architect of his Gulf War victory and co-author of his memoir , Gen .
Brent Skowcroft warns that a U.S. war on Iraq could ignite the entire Middle East , imperiling all of America 's vital interests in the region .
And where is Congress ?
Off on five weeks vacation , junketing , campaigning , fishing and doing everything else besides its solemn duty to debate and declare  or refuse to declare  war on Iraq .
Meanwhile , the War Party has slipped its leash .
This week , The Washington Post reported that the Defense Review Board , chaired by Richard Perle and containing such luminaries as Henry Kissinger , had a secret briefing from a Rand Corp. analyst that Ariel Sharon might have called over - the - top .
Message : After Baghdad comes Riyadh !
" Saudi Arabia supports our enemies and attacks our allies , " the briefer asserted .
Riyadh is " the kernel of evil , the prime enemy , the most dangerous opponent . "
After we capture Baghdad , give the Saudis an ultimatum and , if they balk , seize the oil fields .
For the president and War Party , there is now no turning back .
But if this war turns into a debacle for America , moral responsibility will belong not only with them , but to this cowardly Congress that , in running away from its duty , has disgraced itself , dishonored the Founding Fathers and disserved the people who elected it .
Korea and Vietnam were presidential wars  undeclared wars that tore us apart .
Because Congress has failed us , we are headed into another .

Crisis usually defines Lebanon , but these days , the country is navigating threats that many describe in existential terms , including a battle entering the third week between the Lebanese army and al - Qaeda - inspired fighters .
Below are pictures of a Palestinian refugee camp in the midst of the carnage :
RTBF reporters kept up the spoof for nearly two hours
The Belgian public television station RTBF ran a bogus report saying the Dutch - speaking half of the nation had declared independence .
Later it said Wednesday night 's programme was meant to stir up debate .
It appears to have succeeded .
Thousands of people made panicked calls to the station and politicians complained .
" It 's very bad Orson Welles , in very poor taste , " said a spokesman for Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt , referring to the famous director 's 1938 radio adaptation of War of the Worlds .
That spoof fooled many Americans into believing Martians had invaded .
We obviously scared many people - maybe more than we expected
Yves Thiran
RTBF head of news
" In the current context , it 's irresponsible for a public television channel to announce the end of Belgium as a reality presented by genuine journalists , " he added .
The French - language TV channel interrupted regular programming with an apparent news report , announcing that Dutch - speaking Flanders had unilaterally declared independence and that Belgium as a nation had ceased to exist .
It showed " live " pictures of cheering crowds holding the Flemish flag , huge traffic jams leading to Brussels airport , and trams stuck at the new " border " .
Monarchists rallied outside the Royal Palace after the report
The broadcast came amid an apparent growth of separatist sentiment in Flanders .
Recent regional elections have shown strong support for the far - right , nationalist Vlaams Belang party , which advocates Flemish independence .
The station 's website crashed briefly as alarmed viewers sought more information , and 2,600 calls were made to a telephone number given out during the spoof .
" Our intention was to show Belgian viewers the intensity of the issue of the future of Belgium and the real possibility of Belgium no longer being a country in a few months , " Yves Thiran , head of news at RTBF , told the BBC .
He said it introduced people to the debate who would otherwise have ignored it , but he admitted some may have taken it the wrong way .
" We obviously scared many people - maybe more than we expected , " he said .
Diplomatic reaction
Some politicians were in on the joke , contributing interviews to the programme with their reactions to the " news " .
But others were not amused .
The minister for audiovisual affairs for the French - speaking community , Fadila Laanan , said the words " this is fiction " appeared on screen half an hour into the broadcast - at her insistence .
" I find it questionable to use such a tactic , which frightened people unbelievably , " she said , adding that a number of people had called her in panic when the " news " broke .
The AFP news agency reported that even some foreign ambassadors in Brussels were taken in , and sent urgent messages back to their respective capitals .
Conical shapes with irregularities produce parastichous spiral ‘ X ’ patterns , such as on the scientists ’ microstructure at left , and a strawberry at right .

While the aesthetics and symmetry of Fibonacci spiral patterns has often attracted scientists , a mathematical or physical explanation for their common occurrence in nature is yet to be discovered .
Recently , scientists have successfully produced Fibonacci spiral patterns in the lab , and found that an elastically mismatched bi-layer structure may cause stress patterns that give rise to Fibonacci spirals .
The discovery may explain the widespread existence of the pattern in plants .
Chaorong Li , of the Zhejiang Sci-Tech University and the Institute of Physics in Beijing , along with Ailing Ji and Zexian Cao , both of the Chinese Academy of Sciences , produced their Fibonacci spiral pattern by manipulating the stress on inorganic microstructures made of a silver core and a silicon dioxide shell .
The spontaneous assembly of Fibonacci patterns has rarely been realized in the laboratory , and the scientists ’ results suggest that plant patterns might be modeled by mutually repulsive entities for both spherical and conical surfaces .
Fibonacci spiral patterns grow on conical - shaped microstructures , shown above in the sinister form .
Scientists conjecture that Fibonacci spirals are the least energy configuration on conical shapes .

“ Patterns that evolve naturally are generally an optimized configuration for an assembly of elements under an interaction , ” Cao explained to PhysOrg.com .
“ We conjecture that the Fibonacci spirals are the configuration of least elastic energy .
Our experimental results provide a vivid demonstration of this energy principle .
This is the best support for this energy principle of phyllotaxis ( or “ leaf arrangement , ” often credited to D'Arcy Thompson ) before a rigorous mathematical proof is available . ”
Fibonacci spiral patterns appear in many plants , such as pinecones , pineapples , and sunflowers .
The patterns consist of spirals that curve around a surface in both the “ sinister ” form ( clockwise ) and the “ dexter ” form ( counterclockwise ) .
The numbers of spirals on a surface are two consecutive numbers in the Fibonacci sequence ( 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , etc. ) .
For example , Li , Ji , and Cao produced a series of spirals of 3x5 , 5x8 , 8x13 , and 13x21 .
Because their microstructures were very small , the next series ( 21x34 ) would have required more than 700 “ spherules , ” creating so much stress that the structure would break .
In their experiment , the scientists used a technique from stress engineering , which is often used for the mass fabrication of micro- and nanostructures .
On an elastically mismatched structure , which consists of a stiff layer on a compliant surface , a variety of buckling occurs .
In this example , the scientists heated a mixture of SiO and Ag 2 O to prepare the silver - cored , silicon - dioxide - shelled microstructures onto substrates at 1270 K , a temperature above the melting point of silver but below that of silicon dioxide , in order to achieve the proper elasticity difference in the subsequent cooling process .
The thermal stress caused the shell to become unstable , and when the conical - shaped structures were cooled , spherules grew on the most stressed sites .
The spherules revealed Fibonacci spiral patterns , sometimes growing in the sinister form and sometimes in the dexter form .
The scientists could n’t determine why one form rather than the other would emerge .
While the chirality is considered random in plants , Li , Ji and Cao suggested that a geometrical factor may tip the balance .
“ Modeled as the least energy configuration on a confining conical support , one element more or less may reverse the chirality , ” said Cao .
“ We are seeking help on this question from simulations . ”
The scientists experimented with different shaped structures , and found that only conical shapes produced Fibonacci spirals with definite chirality .
On the other hand , spheres produced triangular patterns , while conical shapes with irregularities ( such as the shape of a strawberry ) produced an ‘ X - pattern ’ .
Still , the scientists noted that conical surfaces do not have to be perfect to produce Fibonacci spirals , which may explain the common occurrence in nature .
“ The least energy configuration for particles is dependent on the geometry of the space in which the particles are confined — just look at the thorn bundles of various cacti , ” Cao explained .
“ I only know that the Fibonacci spiral patterns are not the least energy pattern for a sphere ( try to imagine a football ) or flat plane ( we can make Fibonacci spirals on street pavement , but it is not self - assembled ) .
However , Fibonacci spirals do appear on conical receptacles in nature .
I conjecture that Fibonacci spirals are the least energy configuration on conical supports , but I cannot prove it . ”
For plants , Cao ’s conjecture is supported even in very old literature , although scientists have yet to discover a mathematical proof .
Cao explained why this proof is so difficult .
“ The patterns on a sphere are now referred to as the Thomson problem , which has been generalized as the Generalized Riesz Problem , ” Cao said .
“ There is no general method to find the least energy configuration for a given confining geometry , and the numerical solution costs enormous time of both the computers and the scientists .
Even worse , it is difficult to make oneself believe that the least energy solution he finds is really the global minimum .
And numerical solutions would never be accepted as proof . ”
Cao added that there are many similar “ embarrassments ” in physics .
He explained how physicists know that the body - centered cubic lattice is the least energy configuration of atoms for many metals , which is also currently unproven .
“ We do wish that one day this will be proven , ” he said .
” You know , as David Hilbert once said , ‘ Physics is too difficult for physicists . ’
In my opinion , a proof of problems of this kind needs new mathematics . ”

The largest bottled - water factory in North America is located on the outskirts of Hollis , Maine .
In the back of the plant stretches the staging area for finished product : 24 million bottles of Poland Spring water .
As far as the eye can see , there are double - stacked pallets packed with half - pint bottles , half - liters , liters , “ Aquapods ” for school lunches , and 2.5 - gallon jugs for the refrigerator .

Really , it is a lake of Poland Spring water , conveniently celled off in plastic , extending across 6 acres , 8 feet high .
A week ago , the lake was still underground ; within five days , it will all be gone , to supermarkets and convenience stores across the Northeast , replaced by another lake ’s worth of bottles .
Looking at the piles of water , you can have only one thought : Americans sure are thirsty .
Bottled water has become the indispensable prop in our lives and our culture .
It starts the day in lunch boxes ; it goes to every meeting , lecture hall , and soccer match ; it ’s in our cubicles at work ; in the cup holder of the treadmill at the gym ; and it ’s rattling around half - finished on the floor of every minivan in America .
Fiji Water shows up on the ABC show Brothers & Sisters ; Poland Spring cameos routinely on NBC’s The Office .
Every hotel room offers bottled water for sale , alongside the increasingly ignored ice bucket and drinking glasses .
At Whole Foods , the upscale emporium of the organic and exotic , bottled water is the number - one item by units sold .
Thirty years ago , bottled water barely existed as a business in the United States .
Last year , we spent more on Poland Spring , Fiji Water , Evian , Aquafina , and Dasani than we spent on iPods or movie tickets – $ 15 billion .
It will be $ 16 billion this year .
Bottled water is the food phenomenon of our times .
We–a generation raised on tap water and water fountains –drink a billion bottles of water a week , and we ’re raising a generation that views tap water with disdain and water fountains with suspicion .
We ’ve come to pay good money –two or three or four times the cost of gasoline –for a product we have always gotten , and can still get , for free , from taps in our homes .
When we buy a bottle of water , what we ’re often buying is the bottle itself , as much as the water .
We ’re buying the convenience–a bottle at the 7 - Eleven is n’t the same product as tap water , any more than a cup of coffee at Starbucks is the same as a cup of coffee from the Krups machine on your kitchen counter .
And we ’re buying the artful story the water companies tell us about the water : where it comes from , how healthy it is , what it says about us .
Surely among the choices we can make , bottled water is n’t just good , it ’s positively virtuous .
advertisement
Except for this : Bottled water is often simply an indulgence , and despite the stories we tell ourselves , it is not a benign indulgence .
We ’re moving 1 billion bottles of water around a week in ships , trains , and trucks in the United States alone .
That ’s a weekly convoy equivalent to 37,800 18 - wheelers delivering water .
( Water weighs 81/3 pounds a gallon .
It ’s so heavy you ca n’t fill an 18 - wheeler with bottled water –you have to leave empty space . )
Meanwhile , one out of six people in the world has no dependable , safe drinking water .
The global economy has contrived to deny the most fundamental element of life to 1 billion people , while delivering to us an array of water “ varieties ” from around the globe , not one of which we actually need .
That tension is only complicated by the fact that if we suddenly decided not to purchase the lake of Poland Spring water in Hollis , Maine , none of that water would find its way to people who really are thirsty .
A chilled plastic bottle of water in the convenience - store cooler is the perfect symbol of this moment in American commerce and culture .
It acknowledges our demand for instant gratification , our vanity , our token concern for health .
Its packaging and transport depend entirely on cheap fossil fuel .
Yes , it ’s just a bottle of water –modest compared with the indulgence of driving a Hummer .
But when a whole industry grows up around supplying us with something we do n’t need –when a whole industry is built on the packaging and the presentation –it ’s worth asking how that happened , and what the impact is .
And if you do ask , if you trace both the water and the business back to where they came from , you find a story more complicated , more bemusing , and ultimately more sobering than the bottles we tote everywhere suggest .
In the town of San Pellegrino Terme , Italy , for example , is a spigot that runs all the time , providing San Pellegrino water free to the local citizens –except the free Pellegrino has no bubbles .
Pellegrino trucks in the bubbles for the bottling plant .
The man who first brought bottled water to the United States famously failed an impromptu taste test involving his own product .
In Maine , there is a marble temple to honor our passion for bottled water .
And in Fiji , a state - of - the - art factory spins out more than a million bottles a day of the hippest bottled water on the U.S. market today , while more than half the people in Fiji do not have safe , reliable drinking water .
Which means it is easier for the typical American in Beverly Hills or Baltimore to get a drink of safe , pure , refreshing Fiji water than it is for most people in Fiji .
At the Peninsula hotel in Beverly Hills , where the rooms start at $ 500 a night and the guest next door might well be an Oscar winner , the minibar in all 196 rooms contains six bottles of Fiji Water .
Before Fiji Water displaced Evian , Diet Coke was the number - one - selling minibar item .
Now , says Christian Boyens , the Peninsula ’s elegant director of food and beverage , “ the 1 liter of Fiji Water is number one .
Diet Coke is number two .
And the 500 - milliliter bottle of Fiji is number three . ”
advertisement
Being the water in the Peninsula minibar is so desirable – not just for the money to be made , but for the exposure with the Peninsula ’s clientele –that Boyens gets a sales call a week from a company trying to dislodge Fiji .
Boyens , who has an MBA from Cornell , used to be indifferent to water .
Not anymore .
His restaurants and bars carry 20 different waters .
“ Sometimes a guest will ask for Poland Spring , and you ca n’t get Poland Spring in California , ” he says .
So what does he do ?
“ We ’ll call the Peninsula in New York and have them FedEx out a case .
“ I thought water was water .
But our customers know what they want . ”
The marketing of bottled water is subtle compared with the marketing of , say , soft drinks or beer .
The point of Fiji Water in the minibar at the Peninsula , or at the center of the table in a white - tablecloth restaurant , is that guests will try it , love it , and buy it at a store the next time they see it .
Which is n’t difficult , because the water aisle in a suburban supermarket typically stocks a dozen brands of water–not including those enhanced with flavors or vitamins or , yes , oxygen .
In 1976 , the average American drank 1.6 gallons of bottled water a year , according to Beverage Marketing Corp .
Last year , we each drank 28.3 gallons of bottled water – 18 half - liter bottles a month .
We drink more bottled water than milk , or coffee , or beer .
Only carbonated soft drinks are more popular than bottled water , at 52.9 gallons annually .
No one has experienced this transformation more profoundly than Kim Jeffery .
Jeffery began his career in the water business in the Midwest in 1978 , selling Perrier ( “ People did n’t know whether to put it in their lawn mower or drink it , ” he says ) .
Now he ’s the CEO of Nestlé Waters North America , in charge of U.S. sales of Perrier , San Pellegrino , Poland Spring , and a portfolio of other regional natural springwaters .
Combined , his brands will sell some $ 4.5 billion worth of water this year ( generating roughly $ 500 million in pretax profit ) .
Jeffery insists that unlike the soda business , which is stoked by imaginative TV and marketing campaigns , the mainstream water business is , quite simply , “ a force of nature . ”
advertisement
“ The entire bottled - water business today is half the size of the carbonated beverage industry , ” says Jeffery , “ but our marketing budget is 15 % of what they spend .
When you put a bottle of water in that cold box , it ’s the most thirst - quenching beverage there is .
There ’s nothing in it that ’s not good for you .
People just know that intuitively .
“ A lot of people tell me , you guys have done some great marketing to get customers to pay for water , ” Jeffery says .
“ But we are n’t that smart .
We had to have a hell of a lot of help from the consumer . ”
Still , we needed help learning to drink bottled water .
For that , we can thank the French .
Gustave Leven was the chairman of Source Perrier when he approached an American named Bruce Nevins in 1976 .
Nevins was working for the athletic - wear company Pony .
Leven was a major Pony investor .
“ He wanted me to consider the water business in the U.S. , ” Nevins says .
“ I was a bit reluctant . ”
Back then , the American water industry was small and fusty , built on home and office delivery of big bottles and grocery sales of gallon jugs .
Fiji Water produces more than a million bottles a day , while more than half the people in Fiji do not have reliable drinking water .
Nevins looked out across 1970s America , though , and had an epiphany : Perrier was n’t just water .
It was a beverage .
The opportunity was in persuading people to drink Perrier when they would otherwise have had a cocktail or a Coke .
Americans were already drinking 30 gallons of soft drinks each a year , and the three - martini lunch was increasingly viewed as a problem .
Nevins saw a niche .
From the start , Nevins pioneered a three - part strategy .
First , he connected bottled water to exclusivity :
In 1977 , just before Perrier ’s U.S. launch , he flew 60 journalists to France to visit “ the source ” where Perrier bubbled out of the ground .
He connected Perrier to health , sponsoring the New York City Marathon , just as long - distance running was exploding as a fad across America .
And he associated Perrier with celebrity , launching with $ 4 million in TV commercials featuring Orson Welles .
It worked .
In 1978 , its first full year in the United States , Perrier sold $ 20 million of water .
The next year , sales tripled to $ 60 million .
advertisement
What made Perrier distinctive was that it was a sparkling water , served in a signature glass bottle .
But that ’s also what left the door open for Evian , which came to the United States in 1984 .
Evian ’s U.S. marketing was built around images of toned young men and women in tight clothes sweating at the gym .
Madonna drank Evian–often onstage at concerts .
“ If you were cool , you were drinking bottled water , ” says Ed Slade , who became Evian ’s vice president of marketing in 1990 .
“ It was a status symbol . ”
Evian was also a still water , which Americans prefer ; and it was the first to offer a plastic bottle nationwide .
The clear bottle allowed us to see the water–how clean and refreshing it looked on the shelf .
Americans have never wanted water in cans , which suggest a tinny aftertaste before you take a sip .
The plastic bottle , in fact , did for water what the pop - top can had done for soda :
It turned water into an anywhere , anytime beverage , at just the moment when we decided we wanted a beverage , everywhere , all the time .
Perrier and Evian launched the bottled - water business just as it would prove irresistible .
Convenience and virtue aligned .
Two - career families , overprogrammed children , prepared foods in place of home - cooked meals , the constant urging to eat more healthfully and drink less alcohol–all reinforce the value of bottled water .
But those trends also reinforce the mythology .
We buy bottled water because we think it ’s healthy .
Which it is , of course : Every 12 - year - old who buys a bottle of water from a vending machine instead of a 16 - ounce Coke is inarguably making a healthier choice .
But bottled water is n’t healthier , or safer , than tap water .
Indeed , while the United States is the single biggest consumer in the world ’s $ 50 billion bottled - water market , it is the only one of the top four –the others are Brazil , China , and Mexico–that has universally reliable tap water .
Tap water in this country , with rare exceptions , is impressively safe .
It is monitored constantly , and the test results made public .
Mineral water has a long association with medicinal benefits–and it can provide minerals that people need–but there are no scientific studies establishing that routinely consuming mineral water improves your health .
The FDA , in fact , forbids mineral waters in the United States from making any health claims .
If the water we use at home cost what even cheap bottled water costs , our monthly water bills would run $ 9,000 .
And for this healthy convenience , we ’re paying what amounts to an unbelievable premium .
You can buy a half - liter Evian for $ 1.35 – 17 ounces of water imported from France for pocket change .
That water seems cheap , but only because we are n’t paying attention .
In San Francisco , the municipal water comes from inside Yosemite National Park .
It ’s so good the EPA does n’t require San Francisco to filter it .
If you bought and drank a bottle of Evian , you could refill that bottle once a day for 10 years , 5 months , and 21 days with San Francisco tap water before that water would cost $ 1.35 .
Put another way , if the water we use at home cost what even cheap bottled water costs , our monthly water bills would run $ 9,000 .

Taste , of course , is highly personal .
New Yorkers excepted , Americans love to belittle the quality of their tap water .
But in blind taste tests , with waters at equal temperatures , presented in identical glasses , ordinary people can rarely distinguish between tap water , springwater , and luxury waters .
At the height of Perrier ’s popularity , Bruce Nevins was asked on a live network radio show one morning to pick Perrier from a lineup of seven carbonated waters served in paper cups .
It took him five tries .
We are actually in the midst of a second love affair with bottled water .
In the United States , many of the earliest , still - familiar brands of springwater –Poland Spring , Saratoga Springs , Deer Park , Arrowhead–were originally associated with resort and spa complexes .
The water itself , pure at a time when cities struggled to provide safe water , was the source of the enterprise .
In the late 1800s , Poland Spring was already a renowned brand of healthful drinking water that you could get home - delivered in Boston , New York , Philadelphia , or Chicago .
It was also a sprawling summer resort complex , with thousands of guests and three Victorian hotels , some of which had bathtubs with spigots that allowed guests to bathe in Poland Spring water .
The resort burned in 1976 , but at the crest of a hill in Poland Spring , Maine , you can still visit a marble - and - granite temple built in 1906 to house the original spring .
24 % of the bottled water we buy is tap water repackaged by Coke and Pepsi .
The car , the Depression , World War II , and perhaps most important , clean , safe municipal water , unwound the resorts and the first wave of water as business .
We had to wait two generations for the second , which would turn out to be much different–and much larger .
Today , for all the apparent variety on the shelf , bottled water is dominated in the United States and worldwide by four huge companies .
Pepsi has the nation ’s number - one - selling bottled water , Aquafina , with 13 % of the market .
Coke ’s Dasani is number two , with 11 % of the market .
Both are simply purified municipal water–so 24 % of the bottled water we buy is tap water repackaged by Coke and Pepsi for our convenience .
Evian is owned by Danone , the French food giant , and distributed in the United States by Coke .
The really big water company in the United States is Nestlé , which gradually bought up the nation ’s heritage brands , and expanded them .
The waters are slightly different –springwater must come from actual springs , identified specifically on the label–but together , they add up to 26 % of the market , according to Beverage Marketing , surpassing Coke and Pepsi ’s brands combined .
advertisement
Since most water brands are owned by larger companies , it ’s hard to get directly at the economics .
But according to those inside the business , half the price of a typical $ 1.29 bottle goes to the retailer .
As much as a third goes to the distributor and transport .
Another 12 to 15 cents is the cost of the water itself , the bottle and the cap .
That leaves roughly a dime of profit .
On multipacks , that profit is more like 2 cents a bottle .
As the abundance in the supermarket water aisle shows , that business is now trying to help us find new waters to drink and new occasions for drinking them–trying to get more mouth share , as it were .
Aquafina marketing vice president Ahad Afridi says his team has done the research to understand what kind of water drinkers we are .
They ’ve found six types , including the “ water pure - fectionist ” ; the “ water explorer ” ; the “ image seeker ” ; and the “ struggler ” ( “ they do n’t really like water that much … these are the people who have a cheeseburger with a diet soda ” ) .
It ’s a startling level of thought and analysis–until you realize that within a decade , our consumption of bottled water is expected to surpass soda .
That kind of market ca n’t be left to chance .
Aquafina ’s fine segmentation is all about the newest explosion of waters that are n’t really water –flavored waters , enhanced waters , colored waters , water drinks branded after everything from Special K breakfast cereal to Tropicana juice .
Afridi is a true believer .
He talks about water as if it were more than a drink , more than a product–as if it were a character all its own , a superhero ready to take the pure - fectionist , the water explorer , and the struggler by the hand and carry them to new water adventures .
“ Water as a beverage has more right to extend and enter into more territories than any other beverage , ” Afridi says .
“ Water has a right to travel where others can ’t . ”
Uh , meaning what ?
“ Water that ’s got vitamins in it .
Water that ’s got some immunity - type benefit to it .
Water that helps keep skin younger .
Water that gives you energy . ”

Water :
It ’s pure , it ’s healthy , it ’s perfect–and we ’ve made it better .
The future of water sounds distinctly unlike water .
The label on a bottle of Fiji Water says “ from the islands of Fiji . ”
Journey to the source of that water , and you realize just how extraordinary that promise is .
From New York , for instance , it is an 18 - hour plane ride west and south ( via Los Angeles ) almost to Australia , and then a four - hour drive along Fiji ’s two - lane King ’s Highway .
Every bottle of Fiji Water goes on its own version of this trip , in reverse , although by truck and ship .
In fact , since the plastic for the bottles is shipped to Fiji first , the bottles ’ journey is even longer .
Half the wholesale cost of Fiji Water is transportation – which is to say , it costs as much to ship Fiji Water across the oceans and truck it to warehouses in the United States than it does to extract the water and bottle it .
The bubbles in San Pellegrino are extracted from volcanic springs in Tuscany , then trucked north and injected into the water from the source .
That is not the only environmental cost embedded in each bottle of Fiji Water .
The Fiji Water plant is a state - of - the - art facility that runs 24 hours a day .
That means it requires an uninterrupted supply of electricity –something the local utility structure cannot support .
So the factory supplies its own electricity , with three big generators running on diesel fuel .
The water may come from “ one of the last pristine ecosystems on earth , ” as some of the labels say , but out back of the bottling plant is a less pristine ecosystem veiled with a diesel haze .
Each water bottler has its own version of this oxymoron : that something as pure and clean as water leaves a contrail .
San Pellegrino ’s 1 - liter glass bottles–so much a part of the mystique of the water itself –weigh five times what plastic bottles weigh , dramatically adding to freight costs and energy consumption .
The bottles are washed and rinsed , with mineral water , before being filled with sparkling Pellegrino–it uses up 2 liters of water to prepare the bottle for the liter we buy .
The bubbles in San Pellegrino come naturally from the ground , as the label says , but not at the San Pellegrino source .
Pellegrino chooses its CO 2 carefully–it is extracted from supercarbonated volcanic springwaters in Tuscany , then trucked north and bubbled into Pellegrino .

Poland Spring may not have any oceans to traverse , but it still must be trucked hundreds of miles from Maine to markets and convenience stores across its territory in the northeast–it is 312 miles from the Hollis plant to midtown Manhattan .
Our desire for Poland Spring has outgrown the springs at Poland Spring ’s two Maine plants ; the company runs a fleet of 80 silver tanker trucks that continuously crisscross the state of Maine , delivering water from other springs to keep its bottling plants humming .
We pitch into landfills 38 billion water bottles a year–in excess of $ 1 billion worth of plastic .
In transportation terms , perhaps the waters with the least environmental impact are Pepsi ’s Aquafina and Coke ’s Dasani .
Both start with municipal water .
That allows the companies to use dozens of bottling plants across the nation , reducing how far bottles must be shipped .
Yet Coke and Pepsi add in a new step .
They put the local water through an energy - intensive reverse - osmosis filtration process more potent than that used to turn seawater into drinking water .
The water they are purifying is ready to drink–they are recleaning perfectly clean tap water .
They do it so marketing can brag about the purity , and to provide consistency :
So a bottle of Aquafina in Austin and a bottle in Seattle taste the same , regardless of the municipal source .
There is one more item in bottled water ’s environmental ledger : the bottles themselves .
The big springwater companies tend to make their own bottles in their plants , just moments before they are filled with water – 12 , 19 , 30 grams of molded plastic each .
Americans went through about 50 billion plastic water bottles last year , 167 for each person .
Durable , lightweight containers manufactured just to be discarded .
Water bottles are made of totally recyclable polyethylene terephthalate ( PET ) plastic , so we share responsibility for their impact :
Our recycling rate for PET is only 23 % , which means we pitch into landfills 38 billion water bottles a year–more than $ 1 billion worth of plastic .
Some of the water companies are acutely aware that every business , every product , every activity is under environmental scrutiny like never before .
Nestlé Waters has just redesigned its half - liter bottle , the most popular size among the 18 billion bottles the company will mold this year , to use less plastic .
The lighter bottle and cap require 15 grams of plastic instead of 19 grams , a reduction of 20 % .
The bottle feels flimsy –it uses half the plastic of Fiji Water ’s half - liter bottle–and CEO Jeffery says that crushable feeling should be the new standard for bottled - water cachet .
“ As we ’ve rolled out the lightweight bottle , people have said , ‘ Well , that feels cheap , ' ” says Jeffery .
“ And that ’s good .
If it feels solid like a Gatorade bottle or a Fiji bottle , that ’s not so good . ”
Of course , lighter bottles are also cheaper for Nestlé to produce and ship .
Good environmentalism equals good business .

John Mackey is the CEO and cofounder of Whole Foods Market , the national organic - and - natural grocery chain .
No one thinks about the environmental and social impacts and the larger context of food more incisively than Mackey–so he ’s a good person to help frame the ethical questions around bottled water .
Mackey and his wife have a water filter at home , and do n’t typically drink bottled water there .
“ If I go to a movie , ” he says , “ I ’ll smuggle in a bottle of filtered water from home .
I do n’t want to buy a Coke there , and why buy another bottle of water – $ 3 for 16 ounces ? ”
But he does drink bottled water at work : Whole Foods ’ house brand , 365 Water .
“ You can compare bottled water to tap water and reach one set of conclusions , ” says Mackey , referring both to environmental and social ramifications .
“ But if you compare it with other packaged beverages , you reach another set of conclusions .
“ It ’s unfair to say bottled water is causing extra plastic in landfills , and it ’s using energy transporting it , ” he says .
“ There ’s a substitution effect–it ’s substituting for juices and Coke and Pepsi . ”
Indeed , we still drink almost twice the amount of soda as water –which is , in fact , 90 % water and also in containers made to be discarded .
If bottled water raises environmental and social issues , do n’t soft drinks raise all those issues , plus obesity concerns ?
What ’s different about water , of course , is that it runs from taps in our homes , or from fountains in public spaces .
Soda does not .
As for the energy used to transport water from overseas , Mackey says it is no more or less wasteful than the energy used to bring merlot from France or coffee from Ethiopia , raspberries from Chile or iPods from China .
“ Have we now decided that the use of any fossil fuel is somehow unethical ? ”
Mackey asks .
“ I do n’t think water should be picked on .
Why is the iPod okay and the water is not ? ”

Mackey ’s is a merchant ’s approach to the issue of bottled water–it ’s a choice for people to make in the market .
Princeton University philosopher Peter Singer takes an ethicist ’s approach .
Singer has coauthored two books that grapple specifically with the question of what it means to eat ethically –how responsible are we for the negative impact , even unknowing , of our food choices on the world ?
“ Where the drinking water is safe , bottled water is simply a superfluous luxury that we should do without , ” he says .
“ How is it different than French merlot ?
One difference is the value of the product , in comparison to the value of transporting and packaging it .
It ’s far lower in the bottled water than in the wine .
“ And buying the merlot may help sustain a tradition in the French countryside that we value–a community , a way of life , a set of values that would disappear if we stopped buying French wines .
I doubt if you travel to Fiji you would find a tradition of cultivation of Fiji water .
“ We ’re completely thoughtless about handing out $ 1 for this bottle of water , when there are virtually identical alternatives for free .
It ’s a level of affluence that we just take for granted .
What could you do ?
Put that dollar in a jar on the counter instead , carry a water bottle , and at the end of the month , send all the money to Oxfam or CARE and help someone who has real needs .
And you ’re no worse off . ”
Beyond culture and the product ’s value , Singer makes one exception .
“ You know , they do import Kenyan vegetables by air into London .
Fresh peas from Kenya , sent by airplane to London .
That provides employment for people who have few opportunities to get themselves out of poverty .
So despite the fuel consumption , we ’re supporting a developing country , we ’re working against poverty , we ’re working for global equity .
“ Those issues are relevant .
Presumably , for instance , bottling water in Fiji is fairly automated .
But if there were 10,000 Fijians carefully filtering the water through coconut fiber–well , that would be a better argument for drinking it . ”

Marika , an elder from the Fijian village of Drauniivi , is sitting cross-legged on a hand - woven mat before a wooden bowl , where his weathered hands are filtering Fiji Water through a long bag of ground kava root .
Marika is making a bowl of grog , a lightly narcotic beverage that is an anchor of traditional Fiji society .
People with business to conduct sit wearing the traditional Fijian skirt , and drink round after round of grog , served in half a coconut shell , as they discuss the matters at hand .
Marika is using Fiji Water –the same Fiji Water in the minibars of the Peninsula Hotel–because Drauniivi is one of the five rural villages near the Fiji Water bottling plant where the plant ’s workers live .
Drauniivi and Beverly Hills are part of the same bottled - water supply chain .
Jim Siplon , an American who manages Fiji Water ’s 10 - year - old bottling plant in Fiji , has arranged the grog ceremony .
“ This is the soul of Fiji Water , ” he says .
The ceremony lasts 45 minutes and goes through four rounds of grog , which tastes a little furry .
Marika is interrupted twice by his cell phone , which he pulls from a pocket in his skirt .
It is shift change at the plant , and Marika coordinates the minibus network that transports villagers to and from work .
Fiji Water is the product of these villages , a South Pacific aquifer , and a state - of - the - art bottling plant in a part of Fiji even the locals consider remote .
The plant , on the northeast coast of Fiji ’s main island of Viti Levu , is a white two - story building that looks like a 1970s - era junior high school .
The entrance faces the interior of Viti Levu and a cloud - shrouded ridge of volcanic mountains .
Inside , the plant is in almost every way indistinguishable from Pellegrino ’s plant in Italy , or Poland Spring ’s in Hollis , filled with computer - controlled bottle - making and bottle - filling equipment .
Line number two can spin out 1 million bottles of Fiji Water a day , enough to load 40 20 - foot shipping containers ; the factory has three lines .
The plant employs 200 islanders–set to increase to 250 this year–most with just a sixth - or eighth - grade education .
Even the entry - level jobs pay twice the informal minimum wage .
But these are more than simply jobs–they are jobs in a modern factory , in a place where there are n’t jobs of any sort beyond the villages .
And the jobs are just part of an ecosystem emerging around the plant–water - based trickle - down economics , as it were .
Siplon , a veteran telecom manager from MCI , wants Fiji Water to feel like a local company in Fiji .
( It was purchased in 2004 by privately owned Roll International , which also owns POM Wonderful and is one of the largest producers of nuts in the United States . )
He uses a nearby company to print the carrying handles for Fiji Water six - packs and buys engineering services and cardboard boxes on the island .
By long - standing arrangement , the plant has seeded a small business in the villages that contracts with the plant to provide landscaping and security , and runs the bus system that Marika helps manage .
In 2007 , Fiji Water will mark a milestone .
“ Even though you can drive for hours and hours on this island past cane fields , ” says Siplon , “ sometime this year , Fiji Water will eclipse sugarcane as the number - one export . ”
That is , the amount of sugar harvested and processed for export by some 40,000 seasonal sugar workers will equal in dollar value the amount of water bottled and shipped by 200 water bottlers .
However we regard Fiji Water in the United States–essential accessory , harmless treat , or frivolous excess –the closer you get to the source of its water , the more significant the enterprise looks .
No , no coconut - fiber filtering , but rather , a toehold in the global economy .
Are 10,000 Fijians benefiting ?
Not directly .
Perhaps 2,000 .
But Fiji
Water is providing something else to a tiny nation of 850,000 people , which has been buffeted by two coups in seven years , and the collapse of its gold - mining and textiles industries : inspiration , a vision of what the country might have to offer the rest of the world .
Developed countries are keen for myriad variations on just what Fiji Water is–a pure , unadulterated , organic , and natural product .
Fiji has whole vistas of untouched , organic - ready farmland .
Indeed , the hottest topic this spring ( beyond politics ) was how to jump - start an organic - sugar industry .
Of course , the irony of shipping a precious product from a country without reliable water service is hard to avoid .
This spring , typhoid from contaminated drinking water swept one of Fiji ’s islands , sickening dozens of villagers and killing at least one .
Fiji
Water often quietly supplies emergency drinking water in such cases .
The reality is , if Fiji Water were n’t tapping its aquifer , the underground water would slide into the Pacific Ocean , somewhere just off the coast .
But the corresponding reality is , someone else –the Fijian government , an NGO –could be tapping that supply and sending it through a pipe to villagers who need it .
Fiji Water has , in fact , done just that , to some degree– 20 water projects in the five nearby villages .
Indeed , Roll has reinvested every dollar of profit since 2004 back into the business and the island .
Siplon acknowledges the risk of slipping into capitalistic neo-colonialism .
“ Does the world need Fiji Water ? ” he asks .
“ I ’m not sure I agree with the critics on that .
This company has the potential of delivering great value–or the results a cynic might have expected . ”
Water is , in fact , often the perfect beverage –healthy , refreshing , and satisfying in a way soda or juice are n’t .
A good choice .
Worldwide , 1 billion people have no reliable source of drinking water ; 3,000 children a day die from diseases caught from tainted water .
Nestlé Waters ’ Kim Jeffery may be defending his industry when he calls bottled water “ a force of nature , ” but he ’s also not wrong .
Our consumption of bottled water has outstripped any marketer ’s dreams or talent :
If you break out the single - serve plastic bottle as its own category , our consumption of bottled water grew a thousandfold between 1984 and 2005 .
In the array of styles , choices , moods , and messages available today , water has come to signify how we think of ourselves .
We want to brand ourselves–as Madonna did–even with something as ordinary as a drink of water .
We imagine there is a difference between showing up at the weekly staff meeting with Aquafina , or Fiji , or a small glass bottle of Pellegrino .
Which is , of course , a little silly .
Bottled water is not a sin .
But it is a choice .
Packing bottled water in lunch boxes , grabbing a half - liter from the fridge as we dash out the door , piling up half - finished bottles in the car cup holders –that happens because of a fundamental thoughtlessness .
It ’s only marginally more trouble to have reusable water bottles , cleaned and filled and tucked in the lunch box or the fridge .
We just ca n’t be bothered .
And in a world in which 1 billion people have no reliable source of drinking water , and 3,000 children a day die from diseases caught from tainted water , that conspicuous consumption of bottled water that we do n’t need seems wasteful , and perhaps cavalier .
That is the sense in which Mackey , the CEO of Whole Foods , and Singer , the Princeton philosopher , are both right .
Mackey is right that buying bottled water is a choice , and Singer is right that given the impact it has , the easy substitutes , and the thoughtless spending involved , it ’s fair to ask whether it ’s always a good choice .
The most common question the U.S. employees of Fiji Water still get is , “ Does it really come from Fiji ? ”
We ’re choosing Fiji Water because of the hibiscus blossom on the beautiful square bottle , we ’re choosing it because of the silky taste .
We ’re seduced by the idea of a bottle of water from Fiji .
We just do n’t believe it really comes from Fiji .
What kind of a choice is that ?
Once you understand the resources mustered to deliver the bottle of water , it ’s reasonable to ask as you reach for the next bottle , not just “ Does the value to me equal the 99 cents I ’m about to spend ? ” but “ Does the value equal the impact I ’m about to leave behind ? ”
Simply asking the question takes the carelessness out of the transaction .
And once you understand where the water comes from , and how it got here , it ’s hard to look at that bottle in the same way again .
以前エントリーには書いたのですが、 グラフをあげていなかったので、お伝えします。
ICVSという （International Crime Victim Survey）という調査です。暗数を含んだより正確な犯罪動向を掴むために33か国で実施されていて、龍谷大学の浜井浩一氏がその第４回（2000年）の調査で先進12ケ国を比較したデータです。
まず、不法侵入及び未遂 ↓ についてはフィンランドに次いで2番めに低いのが日本です。 画像をクリックすると大きくなります（以下同）。
さらに犯罪不安に最も影響を与える暴力犯罪被害 ↓ については飛びぬけて低いのが日本です。日本は以前世界一安全な国といってよいでしょう。
だがしかーし、量刑意識 ↓ となるとなんと犯罪大国、アメリカに続き日本が上から2番目。
これ ↑ 21歳の青年による２度目の侵入窃盗に対する望ましい量刑を聞いたものです。
被害率が低いにも関わらず量刑意識が厳しいのが日本の特徴です。この厳罰化傾向で、国会などで「厳罰化法案」がスイスイとおり、刑務所が過剰収容になってます。世の中では凶悪犯が放りこまれてiいると思い込んでいる人が多く「刑務所が犯罪者でいっぱいだー！日本の治安が～」とか新聞に書かれておりますが、刑務所は作業ができる人を確保するのも難しいほど、さつまあげ1個盗んだだけの高齢者などが放り込まれているのが事実です。刑務所は福祉施設じゃありません。そのあたりは、以前書いたこちらのエントリーをご覧ください「過剰収容のカラクリ」。
なんと不寛容な国なんでしょうか。
さらにさらに少年犯罪対策としては厳罰化を選択する者がトップ
↓ という、大変若者には厳しい国となっています。こんなとこで堂々の金メダルとってどうするんでしょうか。どうしてこんなに少年犯罪に対して厳しいかという点については、90年代後半少年犯罪「報道」大ブームに一因があります。これについてはこのエントリーをお読みください。
ICVS ではないですが 少年犯罪の実態はどうかというと、こちらも浜井先生のデータを使いますと・・・。長いスパンで見たときの激減っぷりは全く疑う余地はありませんが、最近の傾向みても増加トレンドではありません。 これは少年犯罪の凶悪犯罪検挙人員の推移 ↓（すぐ下のグラフ） です（凶悪犯罪とは殺人、強盗、強姦、放火のこと）。 あと覚せい剤事犯 ↓（もうひとつ下のグラフ） の推移です 。
「 もともと （凶悪犯罪人員は） 増加傾向はなく、 と
くに04年からは減少傾向を示しています。覚せい剤事犯件数の推移をみても、今まさにピークと思い込んでる人も多いかもしれませんが、最盛期は1982年で、そこから減少し、97年まで上昇しますがまた減少トレンドです。覚せい剤に起因する凶悪犯罪も増加傾向にはありません。」
浜井先生がおっしゃるに唯一増えているのは「 不良行為」への補導人員 ↓ です。
「 この数値だけは一貫して増加傾向にあり、その傾向は加速しつつあります。「不良行為」とは刑法に触れるような明らかな犯罪ではなく、深夜徘徊や喫煙といった青少年健全育成条例に反する行為を指します。この数値の増加傾向は若者の変化というよりも、警察の対応の変化、すなわち治安要求の変化です。深夜に街にいる若者を見つけると市民が通報しそれによって警察が動いて補導する。一昔前であれば社会が許容していたような行為が最近は比較的すぐに補導につながるようになったのです。」
ようする に 「警察と住民が意味なく、がんばりすぎ(ようするに、うざい人たちが増えている）」ということです。ほんと全くどういう国なんでしょうか・・・。
さらに凶悪犯罪の 「低年齢化」が危惧されていますが、これも統計的には全くギャグです、あいえ、まちがえた。逆です。「少年犯罪」の分野においても、実は「高齢化」の傾向です。例えば暴走族はその総数は減少傾向にありますが、その中で高齢化が目立ってきています。
新聞の見出し に 「 中学生ら 」 とか「 高校生ら」いう 「 ら 」 ついてますが、この 「 ら 」 がクセ者です。中学生や高校生を引き連れている上の世代がいるということです。つまり、足が洗えない19歳とか21歳とかがいるってことで、今迄なら、足が洗えていたんですが、雇用状況の問題でそういった少年がいるのが最近のトレンドなんです。
いずれにせよ、若年層の雇用状況の問題が少年犯罪分野でも「高齢化」という事象につながっているといえるのです。
雇用の創出とセーフティネットの構築が最重要課題です。実態とそぐわない体感治安の増加、それを支える犯罪未然防止の気運と連動するわたしたちの被害者化する社会そのものが問題なのです。
あとものすごく当たり前のこと書きますが、テレビでわーわー報道されるような「たまにいる」極悪非道な犯人は「珍しいから」報道されてるんですよ。だから正しい反応は「珍しいなあ」なんです。

Subset
Cross-product
Conclusion
Higher order functions ( i.e. all , forAll )
Sections ( `elem` xs ) being equal to \x -> elem x xs
Infix operators such as + and `elem` , along with priorities
Beautiful syntax
Lazy evaluation can make some operators more efficient ( but is not incredibly important )
As part of my PhD , one thing I 've been doing recently is specifying and working with set theory operations .
Haskell is the perfect language for this , because in most cases the set theory can be implemented almost directly .
Let 's take a few examples to show how neat Haskell is at this .
I 've done all the set theory in LaTeX - I guess most people who know set theory probably know LaTeX as well !
I 've also used xs / ys for sets , and x/y for elements from the sets .
Although this is n't the way most mathematics would have been written , it does actually make it a bit more readable with some explicit typing :) Subset is defined as : xs \subset ys = \ forall x \in xs , x \in yssubset xs ys = all ( \x -> x `elem` ys ) xssubset xs ys = all ( `elem` ys ) xsThe first version is the direct translation .
We can of course make Haskell a bit closer to set theory with : forAll = flip all Now we have : subset xs ys = forAll xs ( `elem` ys ) That is a pretty direct translation of the mathematics .
One operation I wanted to specify recently was : merge xs ys = { c | \exists x \in xs , \exists y \in ys , c = x <> y}( where <> is an operation I had defined myself ) This time you can use Haskell 's list comprehensions to obtain a translation : merge xs ys = [ x <> y |
xIn this case the Haskell is actually shorter the the corresponding mathematics .
I could give more examples of where the mathematics and the Haskell overlap closely , but they are almost too easy .
Almost every piece of set theory that I 've tried to define in Haskell comes out looking very much like the original .
This closeness allows me to work in mathematics , and then translate things to Haskell easily without worrying about having made mistakes in the translation .
The facilities of Haskell that make the set theory translation so direct include :

Eating healthy is important .
Eating healthy :
Lowers disease risks
Increases productivity
Gives you more energy
Makes you stronger
You probably think eating healthy is expensive .
I 'll be honest — it is .
But there are tricks to spare your savings account and keep it low cost .
Here are sixteen ways to eat more healthy while keeping it cheap .
What is Healthy Food ?
Before we start , let 's define healthy food .
It consists of :
Protein .
The building blocks of muscles , needed for strength .
Fat .
A balanced intake of omega 3 , 6 & 9 .
Veggies .
All kinds , especially green fibrous veggies .
Fruit .
Full of vitamins .
Water . 1 liter per 1000 calories you expend .
Whole grain food .
Oats , rice , pasta , breads , …
On with the tips .
1. Switch to Water .
I drank huge amounts of soda daily for more than 15 years .
Then I started Strength Training and switched to water :
It 's healthier
It 's cheaper
Quit the soda & drink water .
Take a bottle wherever you go .
2. Consume Tap Water .
Check the price of water on your tap water bill .
Now check the price of bottled water .
Quit a difference , is n't it ?
So why are you buying bottled water ?
Cleaner ?
Not necessarily .
Better taste ?
No , simply a matter of Adaptation .
Bottled water companies get their supply from the same source you do : municipal water systems .
It 's like selling ice to Eskimos .
If you do n't trust the quality of tap water , filter it yourself .
I use a Brita Pitcher .
One $ 7 filter cleans 40 gallons water .
3. Eat Eggs .
I always have eggs at breakfast :
Full of vitamins
High in proteins
Low in price
Do n't believe the Eggs & Cholesterol myth .
Dietary cholesterol is not bound to blood cholesterol .
Want to make it cheaper ?
Buy a chicken .
4. Eat Fatty Meats .
Fatty meats are cheaper & more tasty than lean meats .
You think it 's not healthy ?
Check the Fat Myths :
Fat does n't make you fat , excess calories do
You need a balanced intake of fats : omega 3 , 6 & 9
I 'm on the Anabolic Diet , I buy beef chuck instead of sirloin .
5. Get Whey .
The cheapest source of protein . 70 $ for a 10 lbs bag lasting 4 months .
Nothing beats that .
Use whey in your Post Workout Shake to help recovery .
6. Tuna Cans .
Canned tuna is cheap & contains as much protein as meat .
Alternate tuna with eggs , meat & whey .
You 'll easily get to your daily amount of protein .
7. Buy Frozen Veggies .
I mostly buy frozen veggies :
Take less time to prepare
You do n't waste money if not eaten in time
Can be bought in bulk for discounts & stored in your freezer
If you can afford fresh veggies , then do it .
I go frozen .
8. Use a Multivitamin .
Pesticides lower the vitamin levels of your fruits & veggies .
Two solutions :
Buy organic food .
Expensive .
Use a multivitamin .
$ 10 a month .
Choose what fits your wallet best .
I take the multivitamin .
9. Fish Oil. Omega - 3 is found in fish oil .
Benefits of omega - 3 consumption include :
Lowered cholesterol levels
Decreased body fat
Reduced inflammation
You need to eat fatty fish 3 times a week to get these benefits .
Time consuming & expensive , I know .
Try Carlson ‘s Liquid Fish Oil with Lemon flavor .
One teaspoon daily .
You 'll be ok .
10 . Buy Generic Food .
The box might be less attractive , it 's certainly more attractive to your wallet .
Brand - name food will always be more expensive .
You 're paying for the name .
Get real .
Food is food .
Go generic .
11 . Buy in Bulk .
Think long - term .
Buying in bulk is more expensive at the cashier , but cheaper in the long run :
Gets you discounts
Saves time
Saves car fuel
Invest in a big freezer .
Buy meats & veggies in bulk and freeze them .
12 . Go to One Grocery Store .
This grocery store is cheaper for meat , that grocery store is cheaper for veggies , the other grocery store is cheaper for fish …
How many grocery stores are you going to , trying to find the cheapest food ?
Think !
Time is money .
Stop losing a day shopping .
Cars do n't run on water .
Lower your fuel expenses .
I get all my food in a big grocery store near my place .
It has n't the cheapest price for all foods , but it saves me time & fuel .
13 . Make a Plan .
A classic , but worth repeating .
Everything starts with a plan .
Make a list of what you need
Eat a solid meal , do n't go hungry
Go the grocery , get what 's on your list & get out
No need to take your partner or kids with you .
This is not a recreational activity .
Just get your food & get back home .
Executive privilege may not block ex-Rove aide 's testimony , say scholars Michael Roston
Published : Tuesday July 10 , 2007 Print This Email
This Congressional investigators condemned the White House this week for attempting to block two subpoenaed former Bush administration officials from testifying in the probe into the firing of 8 US Attorneys .
But some scholars interviewed by RAW STORY suggested that President Bush 's assertion of ' Executive Privilege ' may not fully obstruct former Bush officials like Sara Taylor and Harriet Miers from testifying .
" Where Bush has it all wrong is in the assertion that a claim of executive privilege can prevent former aides from talking about a subject generally , " said Mark Rozell , a Professor at George Mason University 's School of Public Policy .
Referring to former Karl Rove lieutenant Taylor , he added , " There is no reason that Taylor cannot testify , answer any questions that do not trench on presidential confidentiality , and then refuse to answer those questions that indeed would violate confidentiality .
Certainly there are some areas that would be protected by executive privilege , even in the case of a former aide .
But that is far different than prohibiting her from speaking at all . "
In a letter written Saturday to Senator Patrick Leahy , the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , Taylor 's attorney W. Neil Eggleston suggested that his client would like to testify , but could not .
" She recognizes the burden on any citizen to respect the Senate 's processes and to be responsive to its subpoenas , " he wrote .
" Absent the direction from the White House , Ms. Taylor would testify without hesitation before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
She has participated in no wrongdoing .
She will assert no personal privilege . "
However , Eggleston stated that the President 's assertion of ' executive privilege ' would prevent Taylor from testifying .
Executive privilege is a controversial concept in American government .
Rozell , in a 1999 Minnesota Law Review article , said that executive privilege is " the right of the President and high - level executive branch officers to withhold information from Congress , the courts , and ultimately the public , " and added that it is " now a well - established constitutional power - one with a longstanding history in American government , going back to the George Washington administration . "
But he also noted that it " is controversial in large part because it is never mentioned in the Constitution , " and has been given a bad name since its abuse by President Richard Nixon in the Watergate era .
Rozell was n't the only scholar to question the impact of ' executive privilege ' on Congressional oversight .
In contrast with attorney - client privilege and doctor - patient privilege , the violation of which brings significant professional sanction , another scholar told RAW STORY that the enforcement of ' executive privilege ' is less tangible .
" As for whether Ms. Taylor could be punished criminally or civilly by the Bush Administration , I 'm not sure that they'd have much basis to do that , beyond possibly arguing that she 's released classified information , " said Heidi Kitrosser , an associate professor at the University of Minnesota Law School .
" My guess is that the biggest threat for her is the implicit threat of being blackballed and harassed by the administration , as the administration has been known to do to many an inside whistleblower . "
Taylor 's attorney appeared to recognize that the personal impact of breaking Bush 's desire for privilege is her primary concern .
" [ S ] he can attempt to work out an accommodation with the Senate , which will put her at odds with the President , a person whom she admires and for whom she has worked tirelessly for years , " Eggleston wrote in the letter to Leahy .
But Kitrosser emphasized that violating ' executive privilege ' should be less worrisome to Taylor than the possibility that she might be found in criminal contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with the Senate 's subpoena .
" Taylor is at risk not only of retribution by the Bush Administration , but also punishment for disobeying a congressional subpoena , " Kitrosser added .
" There 's a statutory basis for holding an official in criminal contempt for violating a congressional subpoena . "
At the same time , another observer of White House - Congressional fights over executive privilege suggested there might be a positive benefit of Taylor clinging tightly to the President 's writ .
" If the President invokes executive privilege to prevent Taylor 's testimony , she should honor it so that his overbroad assertion of privilege can be challenged in court , " said the Clinton White House veteran who asked to remain anonymous .
Taylor , Miers will both attend Senate , House hearings Ultimately , the debate may be purely academic .
Salon 's Alex Koppelman reported that Taylor will appear before the Senate committee on Wednesday .
" [ D]espite President Bush 's invocation of executive privilege in regards to the testimony of former White House staffers Sara Taylor and Harriet Miers about the ongoing U.S. Attorneys scandal -- Taylor will still appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday , " he wrote in a Monday afternoon post at the blog War Room .
And on Tuesday afternoon , the House Judiciary Committee confirmed that Harriet Miers would appear on Thursday . " [ F] ormer White House counsel Harriet Miers will attend Thursday 's hearing concerning the US Attorney firings , " the Committee said in a statement .
However , Reps. John Conyers ( D - MI ) and Linda Sanchez made clear that they would carefully consider any assertions of executive privilege .
" Ms. Miers may decline to produce documents or answer certain questions based upon your interpretation of letters you have received from the White House , and those claims will be considered at the hearing , but its of course incumbent on Ms. Miers to appear at the hearing pursuant to the subpoena , " they wrote to her attorney in a Tuesday letter .

Today , Last.fm was acquired by CBS , a company who had the first commercial radio station in the US , ran a record label ( CBS Records ) , and amongst other things are responsible for several respected TV series ( CBS on Wikipedia ) .
The team here have spent a lot of time this year discussing what the future should hold for Last.fm , and while contemplating raising some additional venture capital we were approached by CBS .
As you can imagine , we have been approached numerous times in the past few years from all the usual suspects regarding acquisitions and so on ; CBS are one of the few companies who needed no explanation of what we are doing , and we were impressed at how progressive their plans are .
This deal with CBS gives us a chance to really make Last . fm shine , and gives us more flexibility than other funding options would for doing all the crazy stuff we ’ve had scribbled on whiteboards for years .
CBS understands the Last.fm vision , the importance we place on putting the listener in charge , the vibrant and vocal community , the obsession with music stats , and our determination to offer every song ever recorded .
I ’ll try and answer all ( reasonable ! ) questions regarding the deal and what it means for Last.fm .
Here are some miscellaneous thoughts upfront :
The Last.fm team stays put in London , we ’ll grow the company some more here .
We will continue to execute our world domination plans – our focus is still music and the surrounding ecosystem .
The founders ( myself included ) are still at the helm .
We have more resources at our disposal now , and more clout when it comes to negotiating licensing deals etc .
OH NOES UR SELLIN MY SCROBBLES !!1 !! —
Do n’t panic .
The openness of our platform and our approach to privacy wo n’t change .
There is quite a sense of achievement at Last . fm HQ today , we see this is as a huge boost for Last.fm and we are confident that together with CBS we have the wherewithall to change the music industry , and way people interact with music for good .
Now we are all going for a slap up vietnamese lunch at the Viet Hoa .
We ’ll be back in an hour to finish off our facebook app :)
Four days before Christmas , 1988 .
A flight takes off from Heathrow , headed for New York .
Thirty - eight minutes later , one blip on the radar becomes four .
Hidden in a Toshiba cassette player inside a brown Samsonite suitcase , a block of plastic explosive punches a 20 - inch hole in the left side of the fuselage , right near the “ P ” of the Pan Am logo , sending shock waves through the craft and causing the nose to detach in less than three seconds .
The cockpit flops on the ground near a churchyard outside Lockerbie , Scotland , looking like a severed fish head on a bed of brown and green grass .
One of the wings , loaded with fuel , completely vaporizes upon landing , killing 11 Lockerbie residents instantly .
Fire , metal and flesh rain from the sky .
The ground is strewn with the flight 's crew and passengers , all 259 dead , all from less than one pound of plastic explosive .
With 189 Americans onboard , the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 is the deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. civilians until the second Tuesday of September 2001 .
Libyan involvement is instantly suspected , seen as payback for President Ronald Reagan 's decision to bomb Tripoli and Benghazi in 1986 , and two Libyan nationals are eventually tried for the attack .
Barely a month after the incident , The Nation runs an article asking a question that 's on the mind of many in the intelligence community :
Was a former CIA agent indirectly responsible for the carnage ?
“ When E. Lawrence Barcella Jr. heard about the explosion of Pan American Flight 103 , he immediately thought of Edwin Wilson , the Central Intelligence Agency 's infamous renegade , ” the article begins .
“ In particular , Barcella , the former Assistant U.S. Attorney who tracked down Wilson and put him behind bars , pondered the 40,000 pounds of C - 4 plastic explosive that Wilson , well schooled by the agency in intrigue and arms dealing , sold to Col. Muammar el - Qaddafi in 1977 . ”
Wilson 's involvement is a valid concern , one potentially rich with irony .
And even though the explosive used in the Pan Am bombing turned out to be Semtex , a cousin of C - 4 made in Czechoslovakia , Barcella still thinks of Wilson every time a bomb goes off anywhere in the world .
Here was a guy who had been trained by the U.S. government to set up fake proprietary companies and who turned around and used that knowledge to sell arms to a brazen sponsor of terrorism .
Here was a rogue agent , a death merchant .
During his 1983 trial in Houston for shipping the explosives and his Virginia trial the year before for shipping guns , Wilson maintained his innocence , claiming he was still working under the aegis of the Company when dealing arms to Libya .
The CIA called bullshit and produced an affidavit stating Wilson had n't had any indirect or direct contact with the agency , save for one minor incident , since his retirement in 1971 .
The Houston jury asked for that affidavit to be reread right before bringing back a guilty verdict .
Wilson was sent away for a long time , sentenced to 57 years in all , the first ten spent in solitary confinement .
Justice was served .
But there was just one problem :
The CIA had lied when it said Wilson had n't been in contact with the agency since 1971 .
He 'd actually been in contact with CIA officials at least 80 times .
And the Justice Department knew the CIA had lied and did n't do anything about it .
In 2003 , U.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes vacated the Houston conviction , slapping the government for its willful use of false evidence .
Wilson was freed in 2004 .
He now lives in Seattle .
He 's working on getting his Virginia conviction overturned , as well as a conviction in New York for conspiring to have witnesses and prosecutors killed .
He filed a civil suit in 2005 , but five weeks ago U.S. District Judge Lee Rosenthal declared that the former prosecutors  two of whom are now sitting federal judges  had immunity for their actions .
The history of what exactly happened 30 years ago will always be hazy , but Rosenthal 's ruling makes one thing clear :
The government lied and locked a man up , and there 's not much he can do about it .
Like any good spy story , this one begins with murder : the 1976 assassination of a Chilean ambassador named Orlando Letelier in Washington , D.C. Letelier was rounding Sheridan Circle when a bomb exploded under his car , shredding him and his assistant .
He had been a high - profile critic of Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet .
Seven months later , Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward penned an article titled “ Ex- CIA Aide , Cuba Exiles Focus of Letelier Probe . ”
The Ex-CIA aide was none other than Edwin Wilson , and in the article Woodward outlined how Wilson had been in contact with the Libyan government and how Wilson was being questioned in connection with the Letelier murder .
Nothing ever came of the Wilson - Letelier connection , but the article sent Washington scrambling to figure out what exactly Wilson was doing over there in Qaddafi-land .
And perhaps most important , Woodward 's story placed Wilson 's name in the mind of Assistant U.S. Attorney Barcella , whose eventual pursuit of the arms dealer would span three continents and almost four years .
The revelation that a former CIA agent was running around Libya was n't good PR for the agency , but no one could deny Wilson had been part of the Company .
An Idaho farm boy , he became a spook after a stint with the Marines in Korea , where he suffered a leg injury .
On a hop to D.C. , he told his story to a stranger who gave him a number to call if he ever needed work .
Wilson did call , and next thing he knew , he was taking a battery of tests , the last of which involved a lie detector .
When asked if he'd ever engaged in a homosexual relationship , Wilson became livid .
“ I just remember the time on the ship when a guy in the middle of the night reached up and I had to take care of him , ” he says , making clear his abhorrence for same - sex relations .
Even though Wilson still did n't know exactly what he was applying for , he was sure he'd failed the test .
He was wrong .
From 1955 to 1971 he had a variety of assignments for the CIA , working security for the U - 2 program and infiltrating the labor movement by means of a Master 's program at Cornell .
But it was in Special Ops that he found his niche , setting up proprietary companies that enabled the agency to wheel and deal without attracting too much attention .
Let 's say Country X wants to procure some intelligence equipment , so it asks the CIA for help .
The agency would be happy to oblige , at the very least to keep the Soviets out of the equation , but at the same time it knows Country Y will get really pissed if it ever finds out .
No problem .
Just have a corporation that 's , ahem , completely unaffiliated with the agency make the deal .
Wilson has always had a knack for making money  he graduated college with ten grand in his pocket , thanks to summers spent running grain harvesters through the Idaho farm country  and setting up cover companies was a natural fit for the man who would become an arms dealer .
After leaving the CIA , he was recruited for a top - secret Navy operation known as Task Force 157 , where he worked from 1971 to 1976 .
Wilson set up several companies for Task Force 157 and began hauling coal to Europe .
He tried to give the profits back to the Navy , he says , but accounting was n't equipped to handle the funds , so he wound up using the cash to hire more people .
One of his biggest projects involved measuring the pull of gravity along the coasts of Morocco , Algeria , Tunisia , Libya and Egypt .
This information was crucial for figuring out the desired trajectory of a missile fired from a submarine .
As a cover , Wilson outfitted his ship with equipment for measuring oil deposits , a move that ultimately proved profitable .
“ Actually , the thing made enough money by selling the information to the oil companies to pay for it , ” he says .
“ Worked out good . ”
C - 4 is a highly malleable explosive capable of taking a bullet without going off , making it one kick - ass weapon .
It can be sliced , twisted and shoved into any crevice , and once set off by a detonator it expands at a rate of 26,400 feet per second .
All it takes is an ounce to blow open an airplane window .
You can stick a dab in an envelope and tear off a pen pal 's face .
When stored properly , it lasts up to 20 years .
On October 12 , 1977 , a demolitions expert named Jerome Brower arranged for 856 five - gallon cans to be loaded onto a chartered DC - 8 at Houston Intercontinental Airport .
The cans were labeled as oil - drilling mud , and inside each there were three or four inches of the brown - gray gunk .
Underneath the mud , however , was white - gray clay , C - 4 , 21 tons in all , the largest known private shipment in history .
Its destination was Libya , where Edwin Wilson had set up a one - stop shop for Qaddafi 's regime .
Wilson imported handguns and detonators to Libya .
He brought over retired Green Berets to train the country 's commandos .
He helped arrange land - mine - clearing operations .
He says every deal was done with the implicit permission of the CIA , primarily through conversations he had with Theodore Shackley , the agency 's associate deputy director for operations .
The CIA looked the other way , he says , in exchange for having an inside man .
Those deals gave him incredible access , he says .
“ Plus I made a lot of money out of it . ”
Wilson primarily dealt with Libya as a broker , using his CIA training to make shipments disappear , but there was one instance when his involvement was particularly hands - on .
In 1978 several units of the Ugandan army mutinied and bolted to Tanzania , prompting despot Idi Amin to declare war on his southern neighbor .
Amin invaded the northern province of Kagera and soon realized he needed help , so Libya responded with 3,000 troops , which was far from enough , since , as Wilson says , “ the Tanzanians whipped everybody . ”
Libya needed its troops out , so it contracted Wilson , he says , to hop on a 707 and fly down to drop off supplies and scoop up soldiers .
Upon landing , Wilson told the pilot to keep the engine running while he handed food through the passenger plane 's small doors .
“ All of a sudden , nobody 's taking the food from the door , ” he says , “ and I can't figure out what 's wrong , so I grab an AK and I tell the pilot , ‘ Do n't you leave without me or else . ' ”
And that 's when Wilson exited the plane and saw the soldiers tearing apart the packages and chowing down .
They were too famished to even bother unloading the rest of the cargo .
“ They had been pretty hungry , ” he says .
“ So with a little emphasis I get the plane unloaded and I must 've taken  I do n't know how many people we had on that damn plane . ”
Wilson was indicted on April 23 , 1980 , charged with shipping explosives and soliciting the murder of a Libyan dissident .
The latter rap was the only one he wound up beating .
Also indicted were two of his associates : Jerome Brower , the demolitions expert , and Frank Terpil , another former CIA agent turned arms dealer .
At the time Assistant U.S. Attorney Lawrence Barcella did n't know exactly how much C - 4 had been shipped , but Brower soon freaked out and fessed up to the whole amount .
He eventually got off with a four - month sentence .
Terpil fled to Lebanon , Syria and ultimately Cuba , where he 's still said to live .
Wilson stuck it out in Tripoli , the Libyan capital , farting around , playing tennis with oil workers .
“ I do n't mean to be blasé , but I have fun where - the - hell - ever I am , ” he says .
“ So I got along fine . ”
Wilson did want to clear his name , however , so he agreed to a meeting with Barcella in Rome on July 7 , 1981 .
It was a détente of sorts .
Wilson would provide information on the Letelier assassination in return for not being arrested the minute he got off the plane .
He also had some intel , including details on Libya 's search for an atomic bomb , that he considered far more important than the charges levied against him .
How useful the information actually was depends on whom you ask .
Wilson : “ I gave him a complete rundown of everything the Libyans were doing . ”
Barcella : “ The information he was offering was crap . ”
Wilson went back to Tripoli , and the chase resumed .
Barcella soon employed a secret weapon , a con artist named Ernest Keiser , to try to lure Wilson back out of Libya .
Originally from Germany but also claiming New York or Brazil whenever it was convenient , Keiser was having passport problems when he happened upon a New York Times article about Wilson .
If he could trick the rogue agent out of Libya , he figured , the U.S. government would overlook his sketchy paperwork , so Keiser posed as an employee of the National Security Council and began corresponding with the former spy .
Keiser claimed the council wanted Wilson 's help in setting up a cover company to mount attacks against pro-communist guerrillas in Central America , a move that would surely help wipe Wilson 's slate clean with the Justice Department .
Wilson says he always knew Keiser was n't completely on the up - and - up , but he 'd fallen out of favor with the Libyans after returning from Rome , so he decided to take a chance in June 1982 .
“ I had to get out of there , ” he says .
The Libyans were done with him .
“ They were either going to get me out of the country or execute me , and I had to leave . ”
Before departing , Wilson had given Keiser a half million dollars to start up the front company .
He would never see the money again .
When Wilson landed in the Dominican Republic with a 40 - page plan for the Central American operation in his suitcase , U.S. marshals stuck a gun in his back and escorted him onto another plane bound for New York .
Even on the ride back , Wilson was n't too worried about being prosecuted , he says .
He figured the CIA would stand up for him .
The CIA did n't .
During the Houston trial , prosecutors presented an affidavit signed by Charles Briggs , executive director of the CIA , stating “ with one exception while he was employed by Naval Intelligence in 1972 , Mr. Edwin P. Wilson was not asked or requested , directly or indirectly , to perform or provide any services , directly or indirectly , for the CIA . ”
Wilson knew he had no defense against that , so he opted not to testify .
The jury convened , asked to be read the affidavit one more time , and came back with a guilty verdict on February 5 , 1983 .
Wilson was also convicted in Virginia for shipping arms to Libya and in New York for conspiring to have his prosecutors killed .
His prison stint began in solitary confinement at the federal pen in Marion , Illinois , where one of his neighbors was Christopher Boyce , the affluent twentysomething who sold secrets to the Soviets and was immortalized in the book and movie The Falcon and the Snowman .
Wilson was locked up at least 23 hours a day in a 12 - by - 12 - foot cell at Marion .
“ Cement beds are tough , because the mattress is about that thick , ” he says , holding his large thumb and larger forefinger less than an inch apart .
“ The first ten years were miserable . ”
But he did have a lot of free time , so he began requesting boxes upon boxes of documents through the Freedom of Information Act , often asking for the same information multiple times in the hope the good stuff would n't always be blacked out .
Folder by folder , sheet by sheet , he began to uncover proof of his contacts with the CIA after he'd left the agency and proof the federal prosecutors knew about those contacts .
In 1997 , U.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes brought in local attorney David Adler to represent Wilson in his motion to vacate the 1983 Houston conviction .
A former CIA man himself , Adler could get the clearance to view all the documents , plus he could weed through all the abbreviations dotting them .
He started digging , and finding , and adding to the case .
Adler admits he initially thought of Wilson as just another guy in prison swearing his innocence .
“ But going through that warehouse of materials , ” he says , “ all of a sudden you come across this stuff that starts to support his claims , and you start thinking , ‘ My God , this guy really was screwed over . ' ”
One gun that spewed smoke was a memo from a low - level employee of the CIA 's inspector general 's office , sent just three days after Wilson was convicted in Houston , that outlined several agency requests for Wilson 's services after his retirement .
“ That started the whole house of cards that took 20 years to collapse , ” says Adler .
Two days later a memo titled “ Duty to Disclose Possibly False Testimony ” was drafted by someone in the Justice Department and included a handwritten note : “ Plain meaning of services > the affid. is inaccurate . ”
The next day U.S. Attorney Daniel Hedges wrote a memo defending the affidavit , stating the use of the term “ services ” was not meant to be taken in a broad sense .
And anyway , the logic went , Wilson already knew about his contacts with the agency , so it was n't really new evidence and did n't have to be disclosed .
A week later the government drafted a letter to Wilson 's attorneys that stood by the affidavit but mentioned several of Wilson 's post - 1971 contacts .
The letter was never sent .
Within three months of the conviction , the Justice Department knew of at least 80 contacts between Wilson and the agency after he 'd retired .
These included a meeting with associate deputy director Shackley about providing potential Libyan contacts and another about acquiring a Soviet surface - to - air missile system , not to mention contacts with agency personnel about securing antitank weapons and Iranian body armor .
During Wilson 's appeal , the government slipped in a quick mention of two of his more innocuous contacts with the agency : procuring desalinization plants for Egypt and helping a Laotian general find a house in the United States .
Wilson 's conviction was upheld .
The former spy sat for two decades before Judge Hughes vacated his conviction on October 27 , 2003 .
“ America did not defeat the Axis because it locked up Japanese Americans , ” the judge wrote .
“ America did not defeat the Soviet Union because it tried to lock up its philosophic fellow - travelers here .
America will not defeat Libyan terrorism by double - crossing a part - time , informal government agent . ”
Wilson walked out of prison on September 15 , 2004 .
We 'll probably never know if the CIA actually encouraged the sale to Libya of enough plastic explosive for 40,000 Pan Am Flight 103s , but it 's not tough to imagine a current scenario in which the agency might look at the big picture and okay the deal .
“ I'm telling you right now , ” says Adler , “ if I was an agency officer and somebody told me , ‘ Give me 40,000 pounds of explosives that I can pass on to Osama bin Laden and I 'll tell you where he is or whether he's got a nuclear bomb , ' I would say , ‘ We need to doctor it up some way so it becomes inert after about a week , ' but I would say , ‘ Let 's do it . '
I do n't think you 're doing your job as an American intelligence officer if you do n't jump on that kind of stuff . ”
Now 78 years old , Wilson is busy working on appealing his convictions for shipping guns in Virginia and soliciting murder in New York .
His argument in Virginia is roughly the same as it was in Houston , and he ’s got Adler on the case .
Getting the New York conviction overturned is going to be more difficult , although last year the undercover FBI agent who lured Wilson into arranging the hits was charged with complicity in four gangland - style slayings , so that ’ll probably help his chances .
And then there 's the civil lawsuit , which Seattle superstar attorney Steve Berman , winner of more than $ 340 million for former Enron employees , filed on Wilson 's behalf in October 2005 .
The defendants include Lawrence Barcella and Daniel Hedges , who went on to become big - time private - practice attorneys in D.C. and Houston , respectively , not to mention former prosecutors Stephen Trott and Daniel Jensen , now both sitting federal judges .
The suit alleges Wilson 's Fifth Amendment rights were violated when federal prosecutors knowingly fabricated evidence against him .
It details how the government stripped Wilson of tens of millions in tax court .
It implies Barcella leaked classified documents to author Peter Maas during research for the book Manhunt : the Incredible Pursuit of a CIA Agent Turned Terrorist , which heroized the lawman 's quest for Wilson .
“ The information that Maas got was not classified , ” says Barcella , who claims the author , now deceased , constructed his narrative from grand - jury transcripts to which Wilson also had been privy .
But none of that really matters anymore , because five weeks ago U.S. District Judge Lee Rosenthal dismissed Wilson 's civil suit outright , ruling the behavior of the prosecutors , “ even if improper , is entitled to absolute immunity . ”
When asked to comment on the decision , Houston attorney Hedges said he'd rather not , since there is likely to be an appeal , although the Houston Press did manage to coax from him a bland acknowledgement that Rosenthal 's opinion was “ thoroughly researched and very clearly explained . ”
Wilson 's civil attorney says he definitely plans to appeal the decision .
“ There is a doctrine of immunity that applies to prosecutors , but we believe Judge Rosenthal erred in that he gave it more legs than it has , ” says Berman .
“ The court is saying , ‘ Oops , sorry .
They 're allowed to do that . '
That 's third - world country stuff .
You expect it in Panama , maybe , that government officials could lie and get someone locked up for 20 years and walk away , not in the United States .
It 's just outrageous . ”
As for Barcella , he wo n't comment on what went down during Wilson 's prosecution , but he does say the judge made “ a correct decision in the law , although from a personal standpoint , it 's slightly frustrating ” because the former assistant U.S. attorney will likely never get the chance to defend his actions in court .
You 've got to wonder what he'd have to say .
Paper ' busts ' lawmakers at immigration rally pointing to ' empty boxes '
Ron Brynaert
Published : Monday June 18 , 2007 Print This Email This Lawmakers were pointing to " empty boxes " at a press conference last Thursday , a Capitol Hill newspaper reports .
" At a pro-immigration rally Thursday , a group of politicians including Sens. Mel Martinez ( R - Fla . ) , Edward Kennedy ( D - Mass . ) and Bob Menendez ( D - N.J. ) and Rep. Joe Baca ( D - Calif . ) addressed reporters while picturesquely standing in front of an impressive tower of boxes they said contained letters from a million supporters of comprehensive immigration reform , " Emily Heil reports for Roll Call 's ' Heard on the Hill . '
According to a press release , the letters were part of the " Por la Reforma Migratoria con Piolín " campaign launched by Univision radio personality Eddie ' Piolín ' Sotelo , and was touted as marking " the first time that a letter writing campaign has generated such a large number of letters in support of immigration reform . "
" As the Members repeatedly referred to the letters and gestured toward the boxes allegedly containing them as evidence of the support for the immigration bill that is struggling in the Senate , a crack Roll Call photographer on hand at the event began to grow suspicious , " Heil continues .
" He could see light shining through the handles of the boxes , indicating that they werent full . "
The paper reveals , " Sure enough , a quick check revealed that the boxes were , indeed , completely empty . "
However , as the above photo shows , at least some letters were present at the press conference .
In January of 2003 , a speech by Bush elicited some controversy when it was discovered that " prop " boxes had been relabeled to provide visual cues for the president .
As CNN reported , " When the president delivered his remarks , he did so from the floor of a warehouse with American flags in the background along with the logo ' Strengthening America 's Economy ' on a backdrop of boxes .
The boxes were stamped ' Made in U.S.A . '
One problem :
The boxes were made in China . "
" And that was evident despite an effort to hide labels on boxes surrounding the stage , " the CNN report continued .
" The boxes placed on the side of the stage had ' Made in China ' labels covered up with white pieces of paper . "
A White House spokesman later blamed the incident on an " overzealous advance volunteer . "
Excerpts from Roll Call article : # Carlos Sanchez , spokesman for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus , which helped coordinate the event , said that actually bringing the 310 boxes full of the real , dead - tree letters that Sotelo collected would have presented a security headache in a box - spooked world .
 We didnt want to put Capitol Police through the stress of having hundreds of boxes out there ,  he said of the events Russell Park location .
Turns out , figuring out what the heck to do with the boxes is tougher than youd think .
Sotelo traveled with them in an 18 - wheeler across the country to deliver them , but they couldnt just be dumped at the Capitol .
Now , nonprofit groups are divvying them up and will spend the next weeks sorting them by Congressional district for delivery to the proper Hill offices , Sanchez said .
HOH is shocked  shocked  to learn that in politics , as in theater , all is not as it seems .
# FULL ROLL CALL ARTICLE CAN BE READ AT THIS LINK ( Correction : Article originally incorrectly referred only to Democrats at pro-immigration rally )
Why is it that some people , no matter what dire circumstances life places them in , fight back and work towards something meaningful and some resemblance of success , even if they have to scratch and claw one inch at a time .
Give some people a spoon and enough time and they ’ll dig a mile long tunnel to get where they want to be .
Give some people a bulldozer and they ’ll never even start it up and try .

She wants it all - babies , fame , and to save the world .
But what she definitely does n't want is marriage .
So - could it be true ?
Is Angelina getting ready to dump Brad ?
Sitting at a bar in the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood is a blond , good - looking man with well - chiselled features on an instantly recognisable face .
" You know what it 's like to be on the cover of every magazine , having your personal life dissected with all the lies , all the rubbish ? " he asks me .
He takes a swig from a bottle of beer and says : " It 's hell .
Certainly , pick on me - but why pick on Angelina ?
That 's so low .
She 's such an amazing woman - like Supergirl , in every way . "
Scroll down for more ...
I had just happened upon Brad Pitt while walking through the hotel and went over to say hello .
He was by himself , waiting for friends , and said : " I 'm sorry if I seem to be taking my frustration out on you . "
" So , how are things going with you and Angelina , anyway ? " I ask .
He smiles and replies : " Oh sure , like I 'm going to talk to you about that . "
His attitude is n't surprising in view of reports that Angelina Jolie is thinking about ending it with him after just a couple of years of unwedded bliss .
According to these stories , the actress recently left Brad to take care of their three adopted children , Maddox , five , Zahara , two , and Pax , three , and their own child , Shiloh , born barely a year ago , while she went to Chicago to work on a new movie called Wanted .
This was just a week after she had adopted Pax and told a newspaper in Ho Chi Minh City , Vietnam , where he was adopted : " I will stay at home to help Pax adjust to his new life . "
Next month , she 's due in Prague for more filming and will then hit the road to promote another movie , A Mighty Heart .
Meanwhile , Brad is supposedly at his wits ' end as he tries to figure out how to handle the huge and sudden responsibility of parenthood ( despite the typical Hollywood team of nannies and other functionaries ) .
Reports have it that the passion between Brad and Angelina has cooled in the past year and she 's very close to breaking up with him .
Considering these two have been generating news stories for more than two years - ever since meeting in 2004 on the set of Mr And Mrs Smith - their break - up would be the biggest showbiz story of the year .
To discover the truth , I have contacted some of her friends and associates .
According to one of these reliable sources , Angelina , 31 , is adamant she wants to return to work and does n't appear too bothered about how she balances her career with motherhood .
" She took a couple of years off doing her work as a goodwill ambassador for the UN , spending time with Brad and the kids .
Now she wants back into movies .
If it were up to Brad , I think she would not work for a while , but it 's not up to him .
" She believes she can have it all and , as she once told me : ' I will have it all .
Just wait and see ! '
As for the headlines about her and Brad , she 's used to controversy .
It does n't bother her much . "
That is certainly true .
The first time I met Jolie was in 2001 at a reception for her movie Lara Croft : Tomb Raider .
She was wearing a flowing black gown with a plunging neckline which , along with her long , raven - coloured hair and heavy eye make - up , made her look more like a creature of the night than a movie star .
Seeming dark and enigmatic , she flirted openly with the male reporters .
I could n't help but wonder whether certain rumours about her were true .
For instance , there was a lot of speculation at the time that she and her brother , James Haven , were in an incestuous relationship .
Why ?
Because when she won her Golden Globe in 2000 for Girl , Interrupted , she actually made out with him backstage , her arms around his neck , her lips all over his .
It was pretty creepy .
When I tackled her , she simply asked with an arched eyebrow : " Do I look like the kind of woman who would have sex with her own brother ? "
I answered : " Well , I do n't know what that kind of woman looks like . "
" Exactly , " she countered .
Then , as she drifted off , she looked over her shoulder and winked at me .
Confirmation or denial ?
I was n't sure .
One thing was certain , though : I 'd never had a stranger moment with a celebrity .
It 's interesting how her image has since changed .
Today , Angelina Jolie is thought of as a philanthropic woman concerned about poverty - stricken countries and the adoption of disadvantaged children .
As a UN ambassador , she is respected for donating money for hospitals and shelters .
Certainly , Pitt 's status was elevated just by his association with her .
" She 's expanded his horizons , " says a friend from his home state of Missouri .
" He 's a totally different man .
It 's like he 's living with Mother Teresa now as she ministers to the poor , the sick , the orphaned . "
Not long ago , it definitely was n't Mother Teresa who sprang to mind when one thought of Angelina Jolie .
In 1996 , when marrying her first husband , British actor Jonny Lee Miller , she used her own blood to paint his name on the white shirt she wore at the ceremony .
Then , in keeping with her vampire image , she wore a phial full of the blood of her second husband , Billy Bob Thornton , around her neck .
She also admitted to being fascinated by knives , corpses and mortuary science ( she took embalming classes in Los Angeles at the age of 15 ! ) and said she was fascinated with sado - masochistic sex .
Talking of her first sexual relationship , she said : " I brought knives out and we had a night where we attacked each other .
It was so primitive and it felt so honest .
But then I had to deal with not telling my mother - and wearing bandages to high school . "
She also said she was bisexual , admitting to an affair with actress Jenny Shimizu , who later observed Jolie " has a very dominant personality " .
It 's remarkable that Angelina has managed to reinvent herself , but what makes this process even more astonishing is that she achieved it at a time when many people blamed her for Brad ending his popular marriage to Jennifer Aniston .
There had been persistent rumours that Jolie and Pitt were romantically involved when the Friends actress announced her marriage to Brad was over .
Less than a month later , Pitt and Jolie were photographed frolicking on the beach .
But while the reputation of being " the other woman " might have destroyed the careers of some actresses , the scandal did n't even dent Jolie 's image .
Remarkably , she has prospered using her own instinct and without a publicist .
That is a rarity in Hollywood - a star who does n't have at least one lackey to clean up private messes for public consumption .
Above all , she uses the media to her advantage .
People close to her have revealed that she carefully orchestrates many of the photographs taken of her .
She calls paparazzi and tells them where she 'll be , and even asks for copies if she likes the photos .
Typical was when she collected her adopted son , Pax , from the Tam Binh Orphanage in Vietnam .
A few days later , she staged photos of herself , Pitt and the kids and sold them to magazines for millions of dollars - then gave all proceeds to charities .
Her attitude was that the magazines would manage to get their own pictures in due course and she said privately : " I may as well control how they get them , make them pay and use the money for a good purpose . "
Tellingly , an executive on the Hollywood magazine Variety said : " Nowadays , she is perceived as somewhat saint - like - a woman who only wants to do good in the world .
When you 're in her presence , she 's so serene , you 'd feel like an idiot asking a dumb question such as : ' So , did you break up Jennifer Aniston 's home ? ' "
On the rare occasion when she has been forced to explain what happened with the Pitt - Aniston marriage , she has come across as most self - possessed .
" To be intimate with a married man , when my own father cheated on my mother , is not something I could forgive .
I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that .
I would n't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife , " she said .
Only in January 2006 , when Angelina was clearly pregnant , did she confirm she was carrying Pitt 's child .
But then came the problems .
" It 's been downhill from there for them , " said one of the couple 's intimates .
" It was too much too soon , especially for Brad .
They 're bickering an awful lot these days .
They 're like an old married couple with kids - and they never even got married . "
According to Jim Cruse , who has known the actor for many years : " Brad always said he wanted a family .
But you should be careful what you ask for .
He got four kids in two years , all under the age of six .
It 's no picnic .
" Angelina is great with the kids - she loves her children .
But they both still want to make movies . "
Cruse says the couple are helped by being able to take the children to a day - care centre in nearby Burbank when they are working in Los Angeles .
Indeed , security at the popular Bright Horizons centre is at an all - time high now that the Jolie - Pitt brood is enrolled .
Other parents are asked not to use mobile phones to ensure they do n't take pictures of Pitt , Jolie or their children .
" So it 's not as if either Brad or Angelina is chained to the house with a bunch of screaming kids all day , " says Jim Cruse .
Still , a friend of Jolie 's seemed to suggest that Angelina could get out of the relationship easily if she chose : " She 's been married twice before .
She knows she 's not the marrying kind , which is why she has n't married Brad .
" He 's much more domesticated .
He 'd marry her in a second if that 's what she wanted .
She does n't .
So , if it ends , I think she could extricate herself without too much trouble . "
Her friends well remember , of course , when Angelina and Billy Bob Thornton were so inseparable it seemed impossible she would ever leave him .
Yet that marriage ended very suddenly .
Angelina explained that she " woke up one day and felt differently , and that was the end of that " .
Added Jim Cruse : " I do n't think she 's ever really been content .
If you ask me , this thing about her ' wanting it all ' is just another way of saying she 's never happy .
The truth is that she makes no excuses for who she is .
She thinks of herself as a survivor . "
Angelina Jolie is a survivor .
Although she comes from a broken home , it made her more resilient .
She 's made a fortune in a tough , cut - throat business and with her professional reputation still intact : she 's well - regarded among her peers .
Her manager , Geyer Kosinski , vehemently denies she is placing her career over her family .
" Angelina worked a total of only 35 days last year and is currently scheduled to work 40 days this year . "
However , others in her camp tell a different story .
They say she 's got four more movies on the horizon : two this year - Atlas Shrugged , an adaptation of the Ayn Rand novel , and The Changeling , a drama directed by Clint Eastwood - and two more next year .
Will she be able to manage it all - busy career and hectic home life ?
Who knows ?
" Brad would be devastated if the relationship ended , " concludes Jim Cruse .
" She 's a lot tougher than he is .
She would see to it that he gets to see the kids because they think of him as their father .
Then she 'd just get on with her life . "
Such thoughts make her out to be rather cold .
But maybe that 's how it has to be when a woman who wants it all is faced with the possibility of not being able to have it that way .
In trying to balance everything - movie star career , " husband " , family life - something might have to give and probably - hopefully , anyway - it wo n't be the kids .
" But what 's going to happen when she 's left alone with a whole bunch of children and no man ? " asked one concerned friend of the actress .
" Is she finally going to be happy then ?
She 'll have her independence , sure .
But then what ? "

NEVER underestimate a computer .
Never overestimate one either .
For many years Garry Kasparov , a world chess champion , said that a computer would never beat him ( or , indeed , any other human in his position ) .
In May 1997 he had to eat his words .
Deep Blue , an invention of IBM , did just that .
This was impressive , but it demonstrated processing power rather than intelligence .
Computers are generally good at solving specific problems , not specifically good at solving general ones .
Deep Blue did not learn to play chess from experience .
It was painstakingly programmed with thousands of “ tactical weighting errors ” devised by human experts .
So whenever it selected a move , it used these to work through multitudes of possible options and their possible responses .
No one is quite sure how Mr Kasparov 's processor operates but it certainly does not do that .
One theory goes that the human brain recognises strategic positions in a general way , and that this helps to reduce the problem to a manageable size .
Thomas Serre and his colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have built a computer processing system that tries to work in this general way .
Among the tasks that computers are bad at is recognising broad categories of images .
Tell one to search for something specific , such as a rectangle or even a human face , and it can make a reasonable fist of the task .
Ask it to find “ animals ” among photographs of dragonflies , trees , sharks , cars and monkeys , and it falls over .
Indeed a monkey — or even a human baby — would leave it in the dust .
That , at least , was how it used to be .
But as Dr Serre describes in this week 's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , his computer handles this problem rather well .
In a recent test it even did a little better than humans .
Picture perfect
Given the briefest of glances at a picture , most people believe they have not had time to recognise anything in it at all .
Ask them whether they saw an animal and they consider themselves to be making a futile guess .
Yet those guesses are right much more often than they are wrong .
That is because the brain can carry out immediate visual processing even when it does not have time for any cognitive back - chatter .
A neuroscientist trying to understand how people recognise objects would thus start with this simplest of systems .
That is the purpose of Dr Serre 's computer .
His project is nothing less than an attempt to reverse - engineer the relevant part of the brain .
That part is the ventral visual pathway .
Anatomy shows that it is organised into numerous areas .
Experiments on monkeys , in which researchers have recorded what excites individual nerve cells in each of these areas , give strong hints about how it works .
The pathway is hierarchical .
Signals from the retina flow to the most basic processing area first ; the cells in that area fire up others in the next area ; and so on .
Those in the first area are fussy .
They react to edges or bars in particular orientations .
By combining their signals , however , cells in the second area can respond to corners or bars in any orientation .
And so the system builds up .
Cells in the final area can recognise general things , animals included .
Dr Serre considered his computer 's processing units analogous to nerve cells , and he organised them into areas , just as they are in real brains .
Then he let the machine learn in much the same way that babies do .
First he mimicked early development when nerve cells are plastic .
At this stage babies ' brains tune their nerve cells to visual features according to how common those features are in the world around them .
That is why kittens raised so that they see only vertical lines have brains that look different from those raised in an environment with purely horizontal ones .
Dr Serre 's processor developed sensitivities in a similar fashion when he showed it lots of photographs .
That stage complete , he then told the computer when what it “ saw ” contained an animal , and when it did not .
The result was a model that closely imitates the ventral visual pathway .
Processing units in each area are sensitive to the same set of features as nerve cells in the brain 's analogous areas , and they are linked together as they are in the brain .
This artificial recognition system correctly distinguishes photographs containing animals from those without creatures 82 % of the time ; Dr Serre 's students get it right 80 % of the time .
Moreover , his computer and his volunteers tend to slip up on the same images — and turning photographs on their sides makes poorer animal - recognisers out of both , by roughly the same amount .
A system like this has obvious applications ( it may , for instance , soon be put to use searching for child - pornography sites on the internet ) .
But it also brings more subtle benefits .
Based as it is on how brains work , it may give insights into what happens when they go wrong .
Real neuroscientists rely on lesions ( that is , damaged areas of a brain ) to help them understand what is going on in brains by seeing what happens in response to particular sorts of damage .
Dr Serre has therefore “ lesioned ” his computer system in similar ways .
So far , this has demonstrated the importance in visual recognition of the rare connections that bypass a unit or two in the hierarchy .
A computer chess - player could not have told you that .
Pick your movie format : Download or DVD
For the first time , Hollywood is making its latest movies available for download the same day DVDs arrive .
The first movie to receive simultaneous DVD and download treatment will be Brokeback Mountain , available Tuesday at Movielink ( www.movielink.com).
Now playing on the service , launched today , are recent releases King Kong , Memoirs of a Geisha , Pride & Prejudice , Rent and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire .
" For the first time , consumers have the ability to not just rent a ( downloadable ) major motion picture from the major Hollywood studios but to own them , " Movielink CEO Jim Ramo says .
Consumers will pay for the convenience .
New films such as Brokeback , King Kong and Memoirs of a Geisha will cost $ 20 to $ 30 ; older films such as Jaws , Easy Rider , To Kill a Mockingbird and The Sting will cost $ 10 to $ 16 .
By comparison , new DVD releases often are discounted as low as $ 14 .
Until now , only a few of Hollywood 's latest films have been available online — typically weeks after they have hit DVD — but usually only for rental on sites such as Movielink , CinemaNow and Starz 's Vongo .
Movielink 's announcement beats to the punch a similar service scheduled to launch in the UK next week by movie site Lovefilm , Universal and America Online .
Online retailer Amazon also is reportedly talking with studios about the idea .
" We 're probably three to five years away from any huge market , but early adopters are very interested , " says Mike McGuire of Gartner Research .
Movielink 's downloads will be of lesser quality than DVD but comparable to that of digital cable and satellite TV , Ramo says .
" It certainly looks good on a notebook computer , desktop computer and a TV . "
It takes about an hour to download a film , but it can be viewed within minutes .
Customers can burn copies to DVD , but the movies , which are in Windows Media format , can't be played on standard DVD players .
Downloads can be transferred to up to two PCs .
A copy can be transferred to a laptop , but not to an iPod or Sony PSP , though eventually it will be compatible with Microsoft - supported portables .
Studios that will supply films to Movielink include Universal , Warner Bros. , Paramount , Fox , Sony and MGM .
Talks continue with other studios , Ramo says .
" The smartest people in Hollywood realize that they are not in the movie business ; they are in the content business , " says Shelly Palmer , author of Television Disrupted : The Transition from Network to Networked TV .
" It is their job to listen to their customers and deliver content in form factors that consumers want . "
Enlarge Focus Features ' Brokeback ' breaks more boundaries by becoming the first movie to offer downloads the same day its DVD arrives .
Sometimes the American public gets hung up on so - called â€œpunditsâ€ that are really just snake - oil salesmen .
They are vilified and debunked because they go out on the proverbial â€œledgeâ€ to try and prove their nonsensical views , and this makes them easy targets for anyone with a high school education to show them for what they are , mostly bigoted wretches that think they have something to prove and they do it by attacking the so - called â€œliberal intelligentsiaâ€ that they couldnâ€™t get to notice them in high school and college because they just werenâ€™t , and for lack of a better word , very bright .
I put Bill Oâ€™Reilly , Glenn Beck , Rush Limbaugh and Shawn Hannidy and Michael Savage in this category along with a bigger list I donâ€™t want to take the time to write out .
You probably can get my drift from the â€œAâ€ list I mentioned .
Then along comes someone that should have actually been embraced by the â€œliberal intelligentsiaâ€ because of his background and breeding .
The guy is Jewish , has a good command of the English language , rarely goes on rants and finger pointing escapades , but is still nothing but a shill for every right wing , anal - retentive , preposterous notion out there .
Iâ€™m talking about Bill Kristol .
Hereâ€™s a guy that has turned his back on his own intellectual curiosity and taken up with the savages of the human race , and tries to dignify their hare - brained schemes by writing succinct literary prose in defense of â€¦absolute crap .
Iâ €™ve seen him on TV talk shows and agreed to disagree with him in my mind .
He had a nice way about him and tried to justify his opinions , but I just thought he was just wrong .
During my trips here and there on the Web however , I ran into the Weekly Standard for which he is the editor .
I read this and couldnâ€™t believe what I was reading .
In fact , a friend from my town wanted to prove something to me and he did it by sending me an article from the Weekly Standard .
My friend turned out to be right about what we were discussing , but I told him that the forum that he used to prove his case was a right wing , cat litter box lining .
I continued to read the magazine though , just to make sure that I wasnâ€™t judging the entire publication by one article .
I finally followed Mr. Kristolâ€™s muses to an article he wrote for the Washington Post .
It was entitled â€ œWhy Bush will be a Winnerâ€ .
He goes on to defend Bushâ€™s Presidency with an arrogance that defies common sense .
He talks about this wonderful economy that Bush has wrought .
Like other right wingers , his idea of the economy is predicated solely on the Dow - Jones .
I want to make a simple statement , the economy should not be judged solely on how the Dow - Jones is performing .
Our Ponzi - scheme government with its lopsided balance of payments is an economistâ€™s nightmare .
The average take home pay for a middle - class family has taken a definite turn for the worse , leaving 10 % of the population with 90 % of the nationâ€™s wealth .
Thatâ€™s a good economy ?
He defends outsourcing , claiming that it was Bushâ€™s vision that stopped the â€œprotectionistâ€  left from stopping it .
Itâ€™s OK that all of our manufacturing and even our service industry like call centers and the like went to New Delhi and Singapore and the Philippines , we have Wal - Mart and McDonalds to fill the hiring void .
He tells us that we should be grateful to Bush for a lack of terror attacks in the US .
Why should the terrorists come to the US when we have brought our best and brightest over to them to kill ?
Not only that , for every Iraqi that dies from â€œcollateral damageâ€ ten new jihadists born .
Thatâ€™s OK though ;
The Bush family is planning on moving to Paraguay in the near future anyway .
They have already bought the land .
He praises Bush for putting Roberts and Alito on the court .
I guess he is getting a kick out of not having to see white kids go to school with black kids , or a woman having a right to choose if she lives or dies if something horrible goes down in the maternity ward .
I think Kristol , like many Jewish people of today in the United States with money ; just love the idea of war in the Middle East , just as long as Israel doesnâ€™t have to do the fighting .
By the way , he used to be the Chairman of the project for a New American Century .
What crap , they should just call that entire group another outgrowth of AIPAC .
He goes on to say that if not for Bush that Saddam Hussein would have been victorious over the U.S. and would have restarted his nuclear weapons program .
He says that if we could only stop Iranâ€™s â€œmeddlingâ€ in the war , General Petraeus could do his job and be successful in September .
Sure , and if only the U.S. would leave Iraq maybe the Iraqiâ€™s would stop killing each other to the tune of over a hundred a day .
Maybe they would just give us the 75 % of their oil that we are demanding of them for being so nice .
This guy is dangerous .
I donâ€™t understand how he is on talk show after talk show , and they never mention that he belongs to the radical right .
They always introduce him as a â€œrespectedâ€ journalist .
Respected by whom , The Project for a New American Century ?
Iâ€™m disgusted with the news shows that never give out this guyâ€™s credentials .
I know what they are now , and if they try to introduce him as a â€œrespected journalistâ€ instead of a â€œrespected right - wing conservative journalistâ€  they are missing the boat .
Heâ€™s so far to the right , he make Rush Limbaugh look like a Marxist .
Sometimes I wonder how these guyâ€™s live with themselves .

VATICAN CITY ( Reuters ) - Pope Benedict on Saturday called on China to lift restrictions on religious freedom that “ suffocate ” the Church and sow divisions among Catholics , in his most significant address on China to date .

But the Pope also called for greater dialogue with the officially atheist state , writing in a 55 - page open letter that he sought to restore full diplomatic ties with Beijing that were severed two years after the 1949 Communist takeover .
The Pope , writing to China ’s bishops , priests and faithful , lamented that millions of Catholics in China were still forced to worship under a state - controlled church that refuses to recognise his authority .
Millions of others worship in “ underground ” churches loyal to the Pope , and the Pontiff said the divisions had weakened the Church in China .
“ It is true that in recent years the Church has enjoyed greater religious freedom than in the past , ” the Pope said .
“ Nevertheless , it can not be denied that grave limitations remain that touch the heart of the faith and that , to a certain degree , suffocate pastoral activity . ”
China ’s foreign ministry responded with a short statement saying it was willing to continue “ frank , constructive dialogue with the Vatican ” .
But Beijing also reiterated the Vatican must not interfere in China ’s internal affairs by “ using religion as a pretext ” .
Tensions have repeatedly flared over the appointment of bishops .
China refuses to allow the Vatican to appoint them , saying this would amount to meddling in domestic matters .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
The Pope said on Saturday his ability to appoint bishops is a fundamental part of the ability to fully “ exercise ... the right of religious freedom ” .
He said all but “ a very small number ” of the bishops in China had sought the Pope ’s blessing .
Many , he said , had secretly received a “ clandestine consecration . ”
TAIWAN AND EVANGELISATION
China foreign ministry also called on the Vatican to sever ties with Taiwan , which Beijing considers a renegade province .
“ We hope that the Vatican will show real initiatives and it must not again lay down fresh obstacles , ” ministry spokesman Qin Gang said in a statement .
The Pope did not address Taiwan .
The Vatican said in an accompanying note it was ready to transfer its embassy from Taiwan to China “ at any time ” in the event of a deal with Beijing , but it did not offer to sever ties .
The Vatican said previously it wants to keep some kind of relations with Taipei even if it reopens its embassy in Beijing .
Catholics in China met news of the letter with high hopes , even though the document had yet to widely circulate .
“ We ’ll be praying that it helps to foster reconciliation in the Chinese church .
That ’s what we need right now , ” said Father John Baptist Zhang Shijiang , a leader of Jinde Charities in north China ’s Hebei province , a major Catholic organisation .
EVANGELISATION
For the Vatican , China is a country of immense potential .
The Vatican estimated there are only between 8 million and 12 million Catholics in China , but the Pope expressed hope that it would prove fertile ground for evangelisation .
“ During the first Christian millennium the Cross was planted in Europe and during the second in the American continent and in Africa , ” the German - born Pope wrote .
“ During the third millennium a great harvest of faith will be reaped in the vast and vibrant Asian continent . ”
But until relations improved , the Pontiff acknowledged the challenges facing the “ nascent ” Church in China .
He urged his followers in China , when possible , to seek out clergy who were in communion with the Pope .
But , if that were not viable , the Pope said they should attend Church regardless .
It seems that the government and the mainstream media are actively avoiding the use of a simple word , illegal .
Let ’s take a look at the definition of illegal , just as a refresher : against the law .
A longer definition is as follows : behavior that can result in either criminal sanctions , such as prison sentences or fines , or civil sanctions , such as liability or injunctions .
Seems clear enough , right ?
The more and more illegal activity I ’ve been reading about this past year or two , the more obvious it is that the word is not being used on purpose .
I noticed the trend starting when the first warrantless wiretapping scandal started .
The wiretapping went counter to the foundation of FISA , which requires court approval of all such activities .
Ok , then the program was illegal right ?
Nope , it was reported as “ extrajudicial ” everywhere I looked .
A more recent study of the president ’s excessive use of signing statements declared that the administration did not carry out the provisions “ according to law . ”
So …then at least one person must have committed an illegal act , right ?
Of course not .
This past June , the CIA declassified 702 pages of “ misdeeds . ”
By misdeeds , they mean illegal activities .
The list is long and the violations are clear , but the word illegal is almost nowhere to be found .
Instead , the CIA just “ violated its charter for 25 years . ”
That has a better ring to it , does n’t it ?
That same month , the FBI released an internal audit regarding the use of National Security Letters , a powerful new tool given by the PATRIOT Act .
They found that 10 - 15 percent “ did not follow the required legal procedures . ”
Finally , someone admits they did something illegal !
Wait , what ’s that ?
It ’s not illegal , those silly agents were just “ non-compliant . ”
Who remembers the Jack Abramoff scandal , or the partisan firing of eight U.S. attorneys ?
Well , good thing we have the Presidential Records Act to keep track of internal communications .
These should both be easy cases .
Wait , what do you mean that 88 White House aides used privately controlled RNC email accounts , and that 51 of them have been mysteriously deleted ?
Good thing it ’s not illegal though , CNN reports that they just “ skirted the law . ”
Part of me hopes that this is all just a journalism necessity .
That the media does n’t want to sound like a broken record , so they have to keep inventing new ways to report more and more illegal activities .
The other part of me thinks the word is being actively avoided because either they do n’t want someone held accountable for their actions , or they know that no one in a position of power would be anyway .
The moral of the story is that everyone needs to become active in politics , or at least understand what ’s going on , in order to bring some much - needed change .
I 've said it before , I 'll say it again -- if Republicans lose their fundraising advantage , they 've got nothing left .
They 've always lost on the issues , but have used money to destroy Democratic candidates , to muddy the issues , and to fund organized campaigns to disenfranchising Democratic base voters .
The underfunded Democrats have thus suffered as a result .
But that is now changing .
According to preliminary fundraising numbers released by the campaigns this week , the combined Democratic field raised about $ 80 million , compared with roughly $ 50 million collected by their GOP adversaries .
In 1999 , the last presidential race without an incumbent in the race , Republicans raised $ 33 million in the first quarter , compared with $ 13 million by the Democrats , according to the Campaign Finance Institute .
The disparity was also evident in 1988 , when the Republican field reported $ 19 million in first - quarter fundraising , compared with $ 3 million by the Democrats .(...)
The lag in donations extends beyond the presidential field .
The Republican National Committee is expected to report $ 25 million in first - quarter revenue later this month .
Last year , the RNC raised $ 32 million in the same quarter .
And in 2003 , the start of the last presidential cycle , it collected $ 29 million .
The Democratic National Committee has n't caught , or surpassed , the RNC , which has long been the political fundraising giant .
Still , the DNC has reported raising more than $ 14 million in the first quarter - a $ 6 million increase over the same quarter in 2003 .
Republicans will still have enough money to run their fear - and smear - based campaigns , but we now have better tools and more money to fight back .
The politics of 2002 , when I started blogging , and those of the 2007 - 2008 cycle are really worlds apart .
A woman was beaten and then forced to behead her lover after her husband found out she was having an affair , police said .

On July 12th , ImpeachforPeace.org cofounder Mikael Rudolph was interviewed by Bert Cohen of WSCA LP FM Radio 106.1 Portsmouth , New Hampshire on the topic of ‘ impeachment ’ for a full hour :
Mikael ’s fellow Cofounder Jodin Morey , who had arranged for this interview , was supposed to also be a part of the program but technical problems prevented that .
On the heels of House Judiciary Chair John Conyers ( D - MI ) saying that he just wants just a few more Representatives to come onboard for impeachment before initiating the proceedings , now would be a great time for New Hampshire residents to contact their own Representatives demanding of them that they honor their oaths to “ support and defend the Constitution of the United States of America against all enemies foreign AND DOMESTIC ” .
Vice President Cheney and President Bush as well as Attorney General Alberto Gonzales have most certainly proven themselves exactly those domestic enemies to our Constitution , the Rule of Law and Habeas Corpus .

Organic farming can build up soil organic matter better than conventional no - till farming can , according to a long - term study by Agricultural Research Service ( ARS ) scientists .
Researchers made this discovery during a nine - year study at the Henry A. Wallace Beltsville Agricultural Research Center ( BARC ) , Beltsville , Md. BARC is operated by ARS , the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's chief scientific research agency .
Plant physiologist John Teasdale , with the ARS Sustainable Agricultural Systems Laboratory in Beltsville , was surprised to find that organic farming was a better soil builder than no -till .
No - till has always been thought to be the best soil builder because it eliminates plowing and minimizes even light tillage to avoid damaging organic matter and exposing the soil to erosion .
Organic farming , despite its emphasis on building organic matter , was thought to actually endanger soil because it relies on tillage and cultivation — instead of herbicides — to kill weeds .
But Teasdale 's study showed that organic farming 's addition of organic matter in manure and cover crops more than offset losses from tillage .
From 1994 to 2002 , Teasdale compared light - tillage organic corn , soybean and wheat with the same crops grown with no -till plus pesticides and synthetic fertilizers .
In a follow - up three - year study , Teasdale grew corn with no -till practices on all plots to see which ones had the most - productive soils .
He found that the organic plots had more carbon and nitrogen and yielded 18 percent more corn than the other plots did .
Consumers got their hands on Vista in late January
Early reviews have tended to damn the upgrade with faint praise , however , characterising it as the best , most secure version of Windows , yet one that contains few , if any , revolutionary features .
While those reviews have focused chiefly on new functions , for the past few months the legal and technical communities have dug into Vista 's " fine print " .
Those communities have raised red flags about Vista 's legal terms and conditions as well as the technical limitations built in to the software at the insistence of the motion picture industry .
Hard look
The net effect of these concerns may constitute the real Vista revolution as they point to an unprecedented loss of consumer control over their own PCs .
In the name of shielding consumers from computer viruses and protecting copyright owners from potential infringement , Vista seemingly wrestles control of the " user experience " from the user .
Vista 's legal fine print includes extensive provisions granting Microsoft the right to regularly check the legitimacy of the software and holds the prospect of deleting certain programs without the user 's knowledge .
During the installation process , users " activate " Vista by associating it with a particular computer or device and transmitting certain hardware information directly to Microsoft .
Even after installation , the legal agreement grants Microsoft the right to revalidate the software or to require users to reactivate it should they make changes to their computer components .
For those users frustrated by the software 's limitations , Microsoft cautions that " you may not work around any technical limitations in the software " .

Vista goes on sale Vista DRM defended Experts challenge Vista security claim
Vista also incorporates Windows Defender , a security program that actively scans computers for " spyware , adware , and other potentially unwanted software " .
The agreement does not define any of these terms , leaving it to Microsoft to determine what constitutes unwanted software .
Once operational , the agreement warns that Windows Defender will , by default , automatically remove software rated " high " or " severe " even though that may result in other software ceasing to work or mistakenly result in the removal of software that is not unwanted .
For greater certainty , the terms and conditions remove any doubt about who is in control by providing that " this agreement only gives you some rights to use the software .
Microsoft reserves all other rights " .
For those users frustrated by the software 's limitations , Microsoft cautions that " you may not work around any technical limitations in the software " .
Those technical limitations have proven to be even more controversial than the legal ones .
Image problem
In December 2006 , Peter Gutmann , a computer scientist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand released a paper called " A Cost Analysis of Windows Vista Content Protection " .
The paper pieced together the technical fine print behind Vista , unraveling numerous limitations in the new software seemingly installed at the direct request of Hollywood .
Mr Gutmann focused primarily on the restrictions associated with the ability to play high - definition content from the next - generation Blu - Ray and HD - DVD discs ( referred to as " premium content " ) .
He noted that Vista intentionally degrades the picture quality of premium content when played on most computer monitors .
High definition DVDs are starting to become popular
Moreover , he calculated that the technological controls would require considerable consumption of computing power with the system conducting 30 checks each second to ensure that there are no attacks on the security of the premium content .
Microsoft responded to Mr Gutmann 's paper earlier this month , maintaining that content owners demanded the premium content restrictions .
Said Microsoft : " If the policies [ associated with the premium content ] required protections that Windows Vista could n't support , then the content would not be able to play at all on Windows Vista PCs . "
While that may be true , left unsaid is Microsoft 's ability to demand a better deal on behalf of its enormous user base or the prospect that users could opt - out of the technical controls .
When Microsoft introduced Windows 95 more than a decade ago , it adopted the Rolling Stones Start Me Up as its theme song .
As millions of consumers contemplate the company 's latest upgrade , the legal and technological restrictions may leave them singing You Can't Always Get What You Want .

JavaScript Hijacking
Interesting paper on JavaScript Hijacking : a new type of eavesdropping attack against Ajax - style Web applications .
I ’m pretty sure it ’s the first type of attack that specifically targets Ajax code .
The attack is possible because Web browsers do n’t protect JavaScript the same way they protect HTML ; if a Web application transfers confidential data using messages written in JavaScript , in some cases the messages can be read by an attacker .
The authors show that many popular Ajax programming frameworks do nothing to prevent JavaScript hijacking .
Some actually require a programmer to create a vulnerable server in order to function .
Like so many of these sorts of vulnerabilities , preventing the class of attacks is easy .
In many cases , it requires just a few additional lines of code .
And like so many software security problems , programmers need to understand the security implications of their work so that they can mitigate the risks they face .
But my guess is that JavaScript hijacking wo n’t be solved so easily , because programmers do n’t understand the security implications of their work and wo n’t prevent the attacks .

Farmers are propped up by consumers , who pay more for their food than the world price , and by taxpayers , who finance direct payments to agriculture .
These transfers have generally fallen as a share of total farm receipts since the late 1980s , but they are still large .
In 2005 the European Union lavished $ 134 billion on its farmers , well ahead of the United States , which provided $ 43 billion .
The reason that Amazon.co.uk do not provide customers with email addresses to respond directly to us is to prevent spam and viruses from getting onto the Amazon system .
This policy also protects the integrity of our customers ' accounts , keeping their details secure .
In response to your comments on our email communications system , email is not necessarily a " risky medium " .
But by not having a direct email address , we can prevent time consuming spam and junk mail that is often automated and sent indiscriminately .
By not having a direct address , we avoid this , and spend our time replying to relevant customer queries .
I hate companies being rude to me .
This includes Amazon.com , Dell and other companies that supposedly pride themselves in high quality customer service .
They are rude to me by sending me emails and then denying me the opportunity of replying via the same channel .
Obviously they know I have an email address , as they are using it .
Obviously they know I have access to the Internet because I can use it to collect said email .
They then assume incorrectly from those two assumptions that my preferred means of response is via a secure web form .
It is n't .
They write to me via email , they get a reply via email .
That 's the way it works .

You are disabled and although some sites might be web accessible it's a slow process navigating round them .
Every site is different .
Your email client is laid out identically regardless of who you email , it 's convenient .
Companies that deny you the opportunity to use email waste your time .
Problem 2 .
An increasing number of people pick up email on PDAs ( Blackberry , Nokia E61 etc ) .
Said people have no problem connecting to pick up email , a few Kb if you have a decent spam filter .
Sending a quick reply is less than 1K .
Fast and cheap .
Bring up a web browser on a small screen and wondering where the relevant link is an then navigating drop list spaghetti to find the right option , and then eventually getting to the right form and typing in all your details whilst staying connected the whole time is extremely wasteful of time and it only takes a few such instances to use up several Mb of bandwidth which is n't much if you are on a fixed package .
It 's astronomically expensive if you happen to be abroad ( or even close to a border as your phone can roam to the foreign network even though you are inside the border ) .
A huge waste of time and money compared to the 1K email .
There 's a vast difference between broadband access from a fast PC and " dial up " speeds on a PDA in another country .
Make no assumptions when dealing on the net where your customers are or how they are accessing the Internet .
Problem 3
The website is n't compatible with your PDA .
I ca n't use Jobserve with my PDA web browser as I get a crippled version that is totally unusable ( it is impossible to log in and actually apply for a job without having to write to the job link sent to me in email manually and hoping I have entered it correctly ) .
So much for click and go .
I can't access the full site as they have disabled access from PDAs .
Problem 4 The website requires you to log in .
Since you access hundreds of websites that require log ins and for security reasons you have a different log in for each site , more time is wasted while you fire up the browsers , access the forgotten password feature , wait for the mail to arrive and then try again .
Problem 5 Amazon gave me this reasonOK , My email is secure .
My system has no viruses .
I assume that a company the size of Amazon can buy a decent spam filter , virus filter and can assure me that none of its employees will ever introduce a virus directly .
However , since Amazon have told me that email is n't secure , why are they sending me correspondence via email ?
I want a web form right away .
I want every company on the planet to have to use my webform to contact me .
I want every company to have an annoying random graphic to decipher before they get anywhere near my mailbox , oh and they can have 10 annoying drop lists like ebay to fill in before they get anywhere near the webform .
I 'll even throw in a useless wizard to hinder and annoy then .
Then when they have filled in their details on my secure webform I 'll even give them an auto generated response that tells them to get lost if they even think of replying to it .
Yeah , that 'll do nicely .
I 'll be secure then .
I wonder how bloody inconvenient the companies that send tens of thousands of email each day would find THAT .
Then when they reply they might appreciate how valuable MY time is with all this secure webform bollocks nonsense .
I sent my comments to Amazon who then changed their tune somewhat and wrote : Yeah , right .
Like you can't get a decent spam filter ?
How many billions are you worth ?
Here 's my response if you still have problems , even with a spam filter .
1 . Send me an email using a custom reply address with the issue number in it .
e.g. amazon-helpdesk-abcd1234@amazon.com2 .
Only accept emails to the above address from the email address used to log the particular issue ( in this case , my address ) 3 .
If you like , you can expire the above address a few weeks after the issue is closed .
That 's it .
Did n't take a brain the size of Jeff Bezos ' to work out that one .
Indeed if they did implement such a system , rather than trying in vain to navigate PDA hostile webforms at great expense , I might actually have more free time when I get back to a real PC and use that time on the Amazon site buying that Harry Potter book etc. that 's coming out soon .
We all want more free time and certainly I would have more if I did n't have to waste it on webforms when email should be good enough .
I have worked on a large number of help desk systems that deal with responses to emails , filter them correctly and then file them against the relevant issue provided the subject is left intact .
It works .
Big Rude Companies Please Pay Attention .
I realise it is somewhat ironic having to fill in a webform to reply to this blog , but this blog is a web based medium , so using the web to reply to a web based medium does n't contradict the above .
Thank you for listening to Rant Of The Day .

Millions of Britons leaving United States airports face mandatory fingerprinting under new security guidelines .
Passengers travelling from the US will have to present their fingers as well as their passports at check - in from the end of next year , according to a senior security official .
Virgin Atlantic , whose customers may be forced to endure longer waits in terminals , has vowed to oppose the move .
Michael Jackson , deputy secretary of the US department of homeland security , said the procedure would apply to all passengers and airlines flying out of the US as the country accumulates information on every foreign national travelling through America .
" We will need biometric as well as biographical data , " he said .
Under current regulations , EU airlines flying to the US have to supply passenger name records ( PNR ) .
The arrangement is a source of tension , amid anger that American authorities are also seeking access to credit card details and email accounts .
European flights have also been forced to turn around mid-air after US authorities barred certain passengers from entering the country , including Yusuf Islam , formerly known as the singer Cat Stevens .
Mr Jackson said fingerprinting every passenger would not lead to long queues , even though airlines would have to do the job , and the procedure would be easy to integrate , over time , " into the business model of the industry " .
He said his department was willing to supply the electronic fingerprinting kit to airlines in the initial phase .
Speaking at the International Air Transport Association conference in Vancouver , he said some larger airlines would be able to adapt existing check - in kiosks to scan passengers ' index fingers .
" We do n't think phase one will be burdensome . "
He said the US would not demand a similar procedure for flights travelling from the UK to the US .
Airlines warned that the process would test passengers ' patience , already stretched by tight security guidelines in US and UK airports .
Virgin Atlantic warned that mandatory fingerprinting " does not make sense " and it is lobbying against the proposal .
" There is a real danger that it could create longer queues , " said Paul Charles , director of communications at Virgin .
" Our check - in staff are not security or immigration officials and that 's not their role . "
Mr Jackson added that the most " catastrophic " threat to the airline industry was a rocket - propelled grenade attack similar to the one that nearly downed an Israeli airliner in Kenya five years ago .
He said another attack on the scale of September 11 2001 was inevitable .
" It is not clear whether it could be in aviation ... but it would be silly not to understand that we will have many more September 11s .
It is a long - term struggle . "
Turn your Django application in to an OpenID consumer
I ’ve just put the finishing touches on the first releasable version of django_openidconsumer , a package that makes it easy to add OpenID consumer support to any Django application .
Full documentation can be found in the repository .
The package consists of Django models that implement the persistent part of an OpenID consumer , some simple views that hook in to the python - openid library from OpenID Enabled and a piece of middleware that makes the user ’s OpenID (s ) directly available within a Django view .
To cut a long story short , it allows you write view functions that look like this :
def example_view ( request ) : if request.openid : return HttpResponse ( " OpenID is %s " % escape ( str(request.openid ) ) ) else : return HttpResponse ( " No OpenID " )
The package also supports simple registration , which lets you request additional details such as an e-mail address or nickname from the user ’s OpenID provider .
I plan to keep the package under active development , with the aim of using it to demonstrate best practises in implementing OpenID ( hence the support for multiple OpenIDs and simple registration out of the box ) .
Next on the list is integration with Django ’s built in authentication system , including the ability to associate one or more OpenIDs with an existing user account .
Please post any feedback as a comment on this entry , and direct bug reports to Google Code .

A germproof full - body suit , complete with a glass face mask and an airhose attachment in the back , lies in a corner .
An odd smell – ether , chlorine and something indefinable – lingers in the air .
Poking out of the rubble are dusty issues of The British Medical Journal and The Journal of Infectious Diseases .
It is all surprisingly low tech : nails are everywhere , but no screws .
There are books by Marx and Lenin and yellowed , handwritten ledgers that would not seem out of place in a museum devoted to a 19th - century Russian writer .
Despite the island 's pedigree , as a site of weaponized viruses and other unknown contagions , its buildings are now being taken apart by scavengers .
In fact , we 're told , the " only access to the island now is in the company of the scavengers , who say they began stripping the island bare back in 1996 . "
They 've now stolen " everything from floorboards to wiring , " and have begun " working on galvanized - steel piping , sealed and towed at a snail 's speed to the mainland shore . "
The real – and much more pressing – question seems to be : what else will these scavengers find on Vozrozhdeniye Island ?
When they arrived for last year 's toil , in July , the scavengers discovered that an official U.S. - Uzbek expedition had come earlier in the year and burned down a row of eight warehouses .
But much of the contents of the warehouses survived the blaze , including a vast array of test tubes , bottles and petri dishes , some still in their original wrapping .
The fire left some half - melted , looking like figures in a Dalì painting , but most are intact underneath a coat of dust .
Like a scene from
Further on , four poles have been set horizontally on pickets two feet from the ground .
Rusty chains hang down , even a few feed troughs .
This is where the horses and donkeys were tied up .
You can imagine them standing patiently in a row at dusk , when the wind would ease and deadly aerosols would be released .
At the highest point on the island , a 40 - foot observation tower stands near the foundations of a gutted building .
A spindly radio antenna still soars .
It was a weather station .
From the top of the tower , six dirt roads can be seen stretching in various directions to other test sites .
It is all very spare and quiet .
The scavengers are silent , too .
Alarmingly , we then read that some of Vozrozhdeniye 's " local rodents " may have been exposed to a super - resilient , weaponized strain of bubonic plague – and that the plague could thus have spread beyond the test range , hopping from flea to flea and following families of rats , just waiting to be passed on to humans .
Bubonic plague , the article quietly notes , already " affects a handful of people each year in Central Asia . "
It 's here that the ongoing risks of the site are made clear : " if a scavenger contracts the plague and makes it to a hospital , he could start an epidemic . "
Worse , Vozrozhdeniye Island is now attracting representatives of the oil industry – who have begun to perform some exploratory drilling .
What might they really dig up ...?
[ Image : An aerial view of Kantubek , an abandoned town on Vozrozhdeniye Island ; via Wikimedia ] .
The implied storylines here for future science fiction , or horror , films is totally out of control – and yet there is still more to learn about Vozrozhdeniye Island .
For instance : it 's no longer really an island .
The Aral Sea , in which Vozrozhdeniye sits , has been evaporating since the 1980s , due to catastrophically mismanaged Soviet irrigation plans – which means that Vozrozhdeniye
This otherwise unremarkable geographical shift has frightening implications :
Many of the containers holding the [ biowarfare agents ] were not properly stored or destroyed , and over the last decade many of the containers have developed leaks .
As the Aral Sea continues to recede , the area will eventually connect further with the surrounding land .
Many scientists fear that animals will move to the surrounding land and eventually carry these deadly biological agents out .
Such a scenario may sound far - fetched , but it 's worth pointing out that there was , indeed , an outbreak of smallpox in 1971 in the nearby city of Aralsk .
According to " a previously secret Soviet medical report , " which included " autopsy reports , pathology reports , containment tactics , and an official Soviet analysis of the outbreak 's source , " there were 10 cases of smallpox reported in Aralsk alone – after which " officials quarantined the city for weeks . "
In the process , " Homes and belongings were decontaminated or burned . "
Potential novelists or screenwriters might want to start paying attention here , though , because this is a near - perfect plot device .
The person believed to have introduced the virus to Aralsk was a young female ichthyologist who had just returned from a four - week research expedition on the Aral Sea aboard the Lev Berg , a small fishing boat .
According to official documents , she was bed - ridden with a fever , headache , and muscle aches aboard the ship beginning Aug. 6 , five days before returning to Aralsk on Aug. 11 .
Before public health officials diagnosed smallpox as the cause of her illness six weeks later , the young woman had exposed her nine - year - old brother , who had exposed others .
Even more interesting , this woman – referred to as Patient 1 – is still alive , and she disputes the official narrative of the outbreak .
Nonetheless , it 's now more or less accepted that the woman 's ship must " have strayed too close to [ Vozrozhdeniye Island ] as smallpox viral particles , alighted on the wind by a Soviet weaponizing additive , floated across the ship 's decks , where Patient 1 netted fish day and night . "

On the desolate central Asian island of Vozrozhdeniye – or Vozrozhdeniya – near the south rim of the shrinking Aral Sea , you 'll find " the remains of the world 's largest biological - warfare testing ground .
"
As The New York Times reported back in 2002 , for nearly four decades Vozrozhdeniye Island was " a practice field for the most hideous kind of warfare .
" The whole site is now abandoned .
Amidst " hundreds of cages designed to hold guinea pigs , hamsters and rabbits , " the New York Times continues , the old Soviet germ labs lie in ruins :

"
The real – and much more pressing – question seems to be : what else will these scavengers find on Vozrozhdeniye Island ?
Like a scene from W.G. Sebald , the actual test site itself is on a nearby plateau .
The landscape there is covered with " scrubby trees " that " have leaned into the road , " as there are no cars driving by to stop them .
The " range , " as it's called – where temperatures can apparently reach 120ºF in the summer – is itself lined with " a row of three - foot - high concrete posts at 300 - foot intervals , oriented in the direction of the prevailing winds .

Madison , JS Online — State Rep. Frank Boyle ( D - Superior ) wants to see President Bush impeached and will introduce a joint resolution saying that Bush has violated his oath of office .
Boyle said passage of the resolution would create “ good cause ” to launch impeachment proceedings ; legislatures in six other states have introduced such resolutions , he said .

NEWARK , Feb . 27  When Yusef Johnson , a 15 - year - old honors student , was killed outside an apartment complex here so gang - infested it is known as Crazyville , a witness came forward within days and told the police she knew the man she had seen fire the fatal shots .
In another case three months later , in November 2005 , officers found two people who identified a street gang leader as the man they saw kill a marijuana dealer named Valterez Coley during a dispute over a woman .
And when Isaiah Stewart , a 17 - year - old wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet from a recent brush with the law , was gunned down that December , another Newark teenager sketched a diagram of the crime scene , correctly identified the murder weapon and named a former classmate as the person he had watched commit the crime .
They seem like slam - dunk cases , but none of the three suspects have been arrested .
It is not that detectives are unsure of their identity or cannot find them .
Rather , it is because so many recent cases here have been scuttled when witnesses were scared silent that the Essex County prosecutor has established an unwritten rule discouraging pursuit of cases that rely on a single witness , and those in which witness statements are not extensively corroborated by forensic evidence .

One theory is that aliens are really trying to write on our landscapes in their own language .
Now why would aliens do that , when this man , Nick Newcomen , just scrawled out a message on planet Earth in a human language .
You can read it in the photo .
Newcomen drove for 30 days , through 30 states , for a grand total of 12,238 miles .
He had a Qstarz BT - Q1000X as the medium for his message , and it can only seen with Google Earth with the recorded GPS device data .
This is probably the biggest sign in the world .
It makes the Hollywood letters look like very fine legal print .
Only the Great Wall of China could underline these three words .
Just to let you know , the driver did n’t write these words in order .
He had to write the word “ Rand ” , then went north to write “ Read ” , and managed to do “ Ayn ” .
Clearly the works of Anthem , The Fountainhead , and Atlas Shrugged are worth reading with this devotion .
Let ’s be glad that his favorite author was n’t Fyodor Dostoevsky or something even longer .
I wonder if he had to go off - road in order to make some of these giant letters .
Seriously , are the roads in the United States shaped like letters so well ?

It 's a potent hallucinogen that 's comparable to LSD .
And while it 's been around for centuries , it 's just now catching on with college students and recreational users nationwide .
It 's called salvia divinorum and it's easy and legal to purchase in most of the United States .
Despite its strong hallucinogenic properties and popularity with young users , salvia is not classified as a controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency .
That means that in most places salvia can be bought straight off the store shelf or ordered on the Internet , where a one ounce of dried salvia leaves sells for $ 7.49 .
Chris Barstow , a 28 - year - old lawmaker from Maine , is out to change that , at least for his state .
He has proposed a bill to the state legislature that would ban the sale of salvia .
" It 's a very strong drug , " Barstow said .
" The idea that we have a hallucinogen of this nature out there without regulation when a low - grade drug like marijuana is banned -- I just do n't see a balance with regard to the drug scheduling practices . "
But if Barstow is fighting a crusade , it 's against an enemy few people know by name .
A plant originally found in Mexico , salvia divinorum or " diviners sage " was used for religious and medicinal purposes by indigenous tribes .
When the leaves are chewed or smoked , they produce a hallucinogenic effect that lasts anywhere between 15 minutes and three hours .
Users describe its effects as an intense , psychedelic high : fingers changing color , a floating sensation , imaginary objects moving through midair .
" For a few hours after you do it , you feel really distracted and just plain stupid .
But for about three minutes after you do it , you feel really elated and out of body , " said one user , a student at Dartmouth College who asked not to be identified .
According to some users , effects of the drug include a sense of contemplative peace and intense calm .
Others report a more negative experience , saying they were overcome with panic and depression , a loss of self - awareness and a lack of bodily control .
It 's in that lack of control that Barstow sees a threat dangerous enough to justify a salvia ban .
" Any drug that if you go onto the Internet says you should have a spotter present poses a threat , " said Barstow of his justification for a ban .
" The worst - case scenario is someone gets behind the wheel and hurts another person or that someone takes the drug in the home and hurts themselves for lack of bodily control .
And we as a society end up incurring the health care cost . "
Despite Barstow 's concerns , there have been few reported injuries directly caused by salvia .
The only known salvia - related death is the 2006 suicide of Brett Chidester , who killed himself shortly after smoking salvia .
His parents blame the drug for his death and successfully pushed for the passage of Brett 's Law , banning salvia in their home state of Delaware .
Only a handful of other states , including Louisiana and Missouri , have added salvia to their list of regulated substances .
Other states , among them Vermont and Georgia , are currently debating a salvia ban .
Tennessee passed a ban but maintained a peculiar loophole :
It is illegal to sell salvia for consumption , but still legal to sell it for use in gardening .
The salvia plant is popular in landscaping and gardening shows in the state .
As for Barstow 's state of Maine , legislators rejected his proposed ban on salvia .
Instead they opted for a less restrictive regulation , outlawing the sale of salvia to anyone younger than 18 .
But Barstow says he 'll keep fighting for an outright ban .
" We end up paying for the [ negative effects ] of those who use substances irresponsibly .
We need to balance between individual citizens and their civil rights vs. the cost the government has to pay for those who can't handle those substances responsibly . "
Moreover , after his experience with the salvia bill , Barstow wants citizens and lawmakers to rethink their approach to drug law .
He sees an imbalance between the legality of salvia and the regulation of less potent narcotics .
" There needs to be an open discussion of the drugs that are scheduled drugs and those that perhaps should be scheduled drugs .
If you 're going to have a tobacco provision of salvia , it should be considered for marijuana as well , " Barstow said .
" The overall discussion needs to be held . "

Like teenagers , babies do n't much care what their parents say .
Though they are learning words at 10 months old , infants tend to grasp the names of objects that interest them rather than whatever the speaker thinks is important , a new study finds .
And they do it quickly .
The infants were able to learn two new words in five minutes with just five presentations for each word and object , said study leader Kathy Hirsh - Pasek , a professor of psychology at Temple University .
Importantly , the babies paired a new word to the object they liked best , regardless of what object the speaker referred to .
" The baby naturally assumes that the word you 're speaking goes with the object that they think is interesting , not the object that you show an interest in , " Hirsh - Pasek said .
The result is not too surprising , Hirsh - Pasek said in a telephone interview .
She says interest drives learning for older children , too , and even adults .
She cites six - year - olds she 's heard talking knowledgably about baseball players ' batting averages .
" How in the world do they get it ?
They 're not going to do decimals until 7th or 8th grade . "
" Ten - month - olds simply ' glue ' a label onto the most interesting object they see , " said Shannon Pruden , a Temple doctoral student in psychology and lead author of a report on the findings in the March / April issue of the journal Child Development .
Later , around 18 months , children learn to use the speaker 's interest — such as where the eyes gaze — as a guide to learning , the researchers say .
Still , Hirsh - Pasek thinks there is a lesson for parents and educators of children at all ages : " Sometimes we fail to take notice of what our learners are doing and what they 're interested in , " she said .
" We all learn best when things are meaningful . "
WASHINGTON , July 1 - Justice Sandra Day O'Connor , the first woman to serve on the United States Supreme Court and a crucial swing vote on abortion and a host of other divisive social issues , announced today that she was resigning , setting up what is sure to be a tumultuous fight over confirming her successor .
After months in which speculation about the Supreme Court focused on the likelihood of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 's stepping down , the resignation of Justice O'Connor , 75 , caught much of Washington , including the White House and her own colleagues on the court , off guard .
Even so , the armies of ideological activists from both sides who had massed in anticipation of a battle over replacing the chief justice , a reliable conservative , quickly pivoted to what they agreed was an even higher - stakes showdown for control of a seat that could alter the court 's balance on an array of polarizing topics .
Justice O'Connor 's decision creates the first vacancy on the court in 11 years , ending the longest period without a change in the line - up of justices in almost two centuries , and it provides President Bush with his first opportunity to name a Supreme Court justice .
The chief White House spokesman , Scott McClellan , said the president would not make a selection until after returning from a summit meeting next week in Scotland .
It is still not clear whether Chief Justice Rehnquist , who is battling thyroid cancer , will step down this summer , creating another vacancy and expanding the confirmation battle to two fronts .
U.S. General Norman Schwarzkopf ( left ) and Iraqi Lt - General Sultan Hashim Ahmed salute each other following the formal surrender of Iraq to U.S. - led coalition forces in 1991 .
Arabic - speaking armies have been generally ineffective in the modern era .
Egyptian regular forces did poorly against Yemeni irregulars in the 1960s .
1
Syrians could only impose their will in Lebanon during the mid-1970s by the use of overwhelming weaponry and numbers .
2
Iraqis showed ineptness against an Iranian military ripped apart by revolutionary turmoil in the 1980s and could not win a three - decades - long war against the Kurds .
3
The Arab military performance on both sides of the 1990 Kuwait war was mediocre .
4
And the Arabs have done poorly in nearly all the military confrontations with Israel .
Why this unimpressive record ?
There are many factors — economic , ideological , technical — but perhaps the most important has to do with culture and certain societal attributes which inhibit Arabs from producing an effective military force .
It is a truism of military life that an army fights as it trains , and so I draw on my many years of firsthand observation of Arabs in training to draw conclusions about the ways in which they go into combat .
The following impressions derive from personal experience with Arab military establishments in the capacity of U.S. military attaché and security assistance officer , observer officer with the British - officer Trucial Oman Scouts ( the security force in the emirates prior to the establishment of the United Arab Emirates ) , as well as some thirty year 's study of the Middle East .
False Starts
Including culture in strategic assessments has a poor legacy , for it has often been spun from an ugly brew of ignorance , wishful thinking , and mythology .
Thus , the U.S. army in the 1930s evaluated the Japanese national character as lacking originality and drew the unwarranted conclusion that the country would be permanently disadvantaged in technology .
5
Hitler dismissed the United States as a mongrel society6 and consequently underestimated the impact of America 's entry into the war .
As these examples suggest , when culture is considered in calculating the relative strengths and weaknesses of opposing forces , it tends to lead to wild distortions , especially when it is a matter of understanding why states unprepared for war enter into combat flushed with confidence .
The temptation is to impute cultural attributes to the enemy state that negate its superior numbers or weaponry .
Or the opposite : to view the potential enemy through the prism of one 's own cultural norms .
American strategists assumed that the pain threshold of the North Vietnamese approximated their own and that the air bombardment of the North would bring it to its knees .
7
Three days of aerial attacks were thought to be all the Serbs could withstand ; in fact , seventy - eight days were needed .
It is particularly dangerous to make facile assumptions about abilities in warfare based on past performance , for societies evolve and so does the military subculture with it .
The dismal French performance in the 1870 Franco - Prussian war led the German high command to an overly optimistic assessment prior to World War I.8
The tenacity and courage of French soldiers in World War I led everyone from Winston Churchill to the German high command vastly to overestimate the French army 's fighting abilities .
9 Israeli generals underestimated the Egyptian army of 1973 based on Egypt 's hapless performance in the 1967 war.10
Culture is difficult to pin down .
It is not synonymous with an individual 's race nor ethnic identity .
The history of warfare makes a mockery of attempts to assign rigid cultural attributes to individuals — as the military histories of the Ottoman and Roman empires illustrate .
In both cases it was training , discipline , esprit , and élan which made the difference , not the individual soldiers ' origin.11
The highly disciplined , effective Roman legions , for example , were recruited from throughout the Roman empire , and the elite Ottoman Janissaries ( slave soldiers ) were Christians forcibly recruited as boys from the Balkans .
The Role of Culture
These problems notwithstanding , culture does need to be taken into account .
Indeed , awareness of prior mistakes should make it possible to assess the role of cultural factors in warfare .
John Keegan , the eminent historian of warfare , argues that culture is a prime determinant of the nature of warfare .
In contrast to the usual manner of European warfare which he terms " face to face , " Keegan depicts the early Arab armies in the Islamic era as masters of evasion , delay , and indirection .
12 Examining Arab warfare in this century leads to the conclusion that Arabs remain more successful in insurgent , or political warfare13 — what T. E. Lawrence termed " winning wars without battles .
" 14 Even the much - lauded Egyptian crossing of the Suez in 1973 at its core entailed a masterful deception plan .
It may well be that these seemingly permanent attributes result from a culture that engenders subtlety , indirection , and dissimulation in personal relationships .15
Along these lines , Kenneth Pollack concludes his exhaustive study of Arab military effectiveness by noting that " certain patterns of behavior fostered by the dominant Arab culture were the most important factors contributing to the limited military effectiveness of Arab armies and air forces from 1945 to 1991 .
" 16 These attributes included over - centralization , discouraging initiative , lack of flexibility , manipulation of information , and the discouragement of leadership at the junior officer level .
The barrage of criticism leveled at Samuel Huntington 's notion of a " clash of civilizations " 17 in no way lessens the vital point he made — that however much the grouping of peoples by religion and culture rather than political or economic divisions offends academics who propound a world defined by class , race , and gender , it is a reality , one not diminished by modern communications .
But how does one integrate the study of culture into military training ?
At present , it has hardly any role .
Paul M. Belbutowski , a scholar and former member of the U.S. Delta Force , succinctly stated a deficiency in our own military education system : " Culture , comprised of all that is vague and intangible , is not generally integrated into strategic planning except at the most superficial level .
" 18 And yet it is precisely " all that is vague and intangible " which defines low - intensity conflicts .
The Vietnamese communists did not fight the war the United States had trained for , nor did the Chechens and Afghans fight the war the Russians prepared for .
This entails far more than simply retooling weaponry and retraining soldiers .
It requires an understanding of the enemy 's cultural mythology , history , attitude toward time , etc. — demanding a more substantial investment in time and money than a bureaucratic organization is likely to authorize .
Mindful of walking through a minefield of past errors and present cultural sensibilities , I offer some assessments of the role of culture in the military training of Arabic - speaking officers .
I confine myself principally to training for two reasons .
First , I observed much training but only one combat campaign ( the Jordanian Army against the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1970 ) .
Secondly , armies fight as they train .
Troops are conditioned by peacetime habits , policies , and procedures ; they do not undergo a sudden metamorphosis that transforms civilians in uniform into warriors .
General George Patton was fond of relating the story about Julius Caesar , who " In the winter time ... so trained his legions in all that became soldiers and so habituated them to the proper performance of their duties , that when in the spring he committed them to battle against the Gauls , it was not necessary to give them orders , for they knew what to do and how to do it .
"

Information as Power
In every society information is a means of making a living or wielding power , but Arabs husband information and hold it especially tightly .
U.S. trainers have often been surprised over the years by the fact that information provided to key personnel does not get much further than them .
Having learned to perform some complicated procedure , an Arab technician knows that he is invaluable so long as he is the only one in a unit to have that knowledge ; once he dispenses it to others he no longer is the only font of knowledge and his power dissipates .
This explains the commonplace hoarding of manuals , books , training pamphlets , and other training or logistics literature .
On one occasion , an American mobile training team working with armor in Egypt at long last received the operators ' manuals that had laboriously been translated into Arabic .
The American trainers took the newly - minted manuals straight to the tank park and distributed them to the tank crews .
Right behind them , the company commander , a graduate of the armor school at Fort Knox and specialized courses at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds ordnance school , collected the manuals from the crews .
Questioned why he did this , the commander said that there was no point in giving them to the drivers because enlisted men could not read .
In point of fact , he did not want enlisted men to have an independent source of knowledge .
Being the only person who can explain the fire control instrumentation or boresight artillery weapons brings prestige and attention .
In military terms this means that very little cross-training is accomplished and that , for instance in a tank crew , the gunners , loaders , and drivers might be proficient in their jobs but are not prepared to fill in for a casualty .
Not understanding one another 's jobs also inhibits a smoothly functioning crew .
At a higher level it means there is no depth in technical proficiency .
Education Problems
Training tends to be unimaginative , cut and dried , and not challenging .
Because the Arab educational system is predicated on rote memorization , officers have a phenomenal ability to commit vast amounts of knowledge to memory .
The learning system tends to consist of on - high lectures , with students taking voluminous notes and being examined on what they were told .
( It also has interesting implications for foreign instructors ; for example , his credibility is diminished if he must resort to a book . )
The emphasis on memorization has a price , and that is in diminished ability to reason or engage in analysis based upon general principles .
Thinking outside the box is not encouraged ; doing so in public can damage a career .
Instructors are not challenged and neither , in the end , are students .
Head - to - head competition among individuals is generally avoided , at least openly , for it means that someone wins and someone else loses , with the loser humiliated .
This taboo has particular import when a class contains mixed ranks .
Education is in good part sought as a matter of personal prestige , so Arabs in U.S. military schools take pains to ensure that the ranking member , according to military position or social class , scores the highest marks in the class .
Often this leads to " sharing answers " in class — often in a rather overt manner or junior officers concealing scores higher than their superior's .
American military instructors dealing with Middle Eastern students learn to ensure that , before directing any question to a student in a classroom situation , particularly if he is an officer , the student does possess the correct answer .
If this is not assured , the officer will feel he has been set up for public humiliation .
Furthermore , in the often - paranoid environment of Arab political culture , he will believe this setup to have been purposeful .
This student will then become an enemy of the instructor and his classmates will become apprehensive about their also being singled out for humiliation — and learning becomes impossible .
Officers vs. Soldiers
Arab junior officers are well trained on the technical aspects of their weapons and tactical know - how , but not in leadership , a subject given little attention .
For example , as General Sa'd ash - Shazli , the Egyptian chief of staff , noted in his assessment of the army he inherited prior to the 1973 war , they were not trained to seize the initiative or volunteer original concepts or new ideas.20 Indeed , leadership may be the greatest weakness of Arab training systems .
This problem results from two main factors : a highly accentuated class system bordering on a caste system , and lack of a non-commissioned - officer development program .
Most Arab officers treat enlisted soldiers like sub-humans .
When the winds in Egypt one day carried biting sand particles from the desert during a demonstration for visiting U.S. dignitaries , I watched as a contingent of soldiers marched in and formed a single rank to shield the Americans ; Egyptian soldiers , in other words , are used on occasion as nothing more than a windbreak .
The idea of taking care of one 's men is found only among the most elite units in the Egyptian military .
On a typical weekend , officers in units stationed outside Cairo will get in their cars and drive off to their homes , leaving the enlisted men to fend for themselves by trekking across the desert to a highway and flagging down busses or trucks to get to the Cairo rail system .
Garrison cantonments have no amenities for soldiers .
The same situation , in various degrees , exists elsewhere in the Arabic - speaking countries — less so in Jordan , even more so in Iraq and Syria .
The young draftees who make up the bulk of the Egyptian army hate military service for good reason and will do almost anything , including self - mutilation , to avoid it .
In Syria the wealthy buy exemptions or , failing that , are assigned to noncombatant organizations .
As a young Syrian told me , his musical skills came from his assignment to a Syrian army band where he learned to play an instrument .
In general , the militaries of the Fertile Crescent enforce discipline by fear ; in countries where a tribal system still is in force , such as Saudi Arabia , the innate egalitarianism of the society mitigates against fear as the prime motivator , so a general lack of discipline pervades .
21
The social and professional gap between officers and enlisted men is present in all armies , but in the United States and other Western forces , the noncommissioned officer ( NCO ) corps bridges it .
Indeed , a professional NCO corps has been critical for the American military to work at its best ; as the primary trainers in a professional army , NCOs are critical to training programs and to the enlisted men's sense of unit esprit .
Most of the Arab world either has no NCO corps or it is non-functional , severely handicapping the military 's effectiveness .
With some exceptions , NCOs are considered in the same low category as enlisted men and so do not serve as a bridge between enlisted men and officers .
Officers instruct but the wide social gap between enlisted man and officer tends to make the learning process perfunctory , formalized , and ineffective .
The show - and - tell aspects of training are frequently missing because officers refuse to get their hands dirty and prefer to ignore the more practical aspects of their subject matter , believing this below their social station .
A dramatic example of this occurred during the Gulf war when a severe windstorm blew down the tents of Iraqi officer prisoners of war .
For three days they stayed in the wind and rain rather than be observed by enlisted prisoners in a nearby camp working with their hands .
The military price for this is very high .
Without the cohesion supplied by NCOs , units tend to disintegrate in the stress of combat .
This is primarily a function of the fact that the enlisted soldiers simply do not trust their officers .
Once officers depart the training areas , training begins to fall apart as soldiers begin drifting off .
An Egyptian officer once explained to me that the Egyptian army 's catastrophic defeat in 1967 resulted from a lack of cohesion within units .
The situation , he said , had only marginally improved in 1973 .
Iraqi prisoners in 1991 showed a remarkable fear and enmity toward their officers .
Decision - making and Responsibility
Decisions are made and delivered from on high , with very little lateral communication .
This leads to a highly centralized system , with authority hardly ever delegated .
Rarely does an officer make a critical decision on his own ; instead , he prefers the safe course of being identified as industrious , intelligent , loyal — and compliant .
Bringing attention to oneself as an innovator or someone prone to make unilateral decisions is a recipe for trouble .
As in civilian life , conformism is the overwhelming societal norm ; the nail that stands up gets hammered down .
Orders and information flow from top to bottom ; they are not to be reinterpreted , amended , or modified in any way .
U.S. trainers often experience frustration obtaining a decision from a counterpart , not realizing that the Arab officer lacks the authority to make the decision — a frustration amplified by the Arab 's understandable reluctance to admit that he lacks that authority .
This author has several times seen decisions that could have been made at the battalion level concerning such matters as class meeting times and locations requiring approval from the ministry of defense .
All of which has led American trainers to develop a rule of thumb : a sergeant first class in the U.S. Army has as much authority as a colonel in an Arab army .
Methods of instruction and subject matter are dictated from higher authorities .
Unit commanders have very little to say about these affairs .
The politicized nature of the Arab militaries means that political factors weigh heavily and frequently override military considerations .
Officers with initiative and a predilection for unilateral action pose a threat to the regime .
This can be seen not just at the level of national strategy but in every aspect of military operations and training .
If Arab militaries became less politicized and more professional in preparation for the 1973 war with Israel , 22 once the fighting ended , old habits returned .
Now , an increasingly bureaucratized military establishment weighs in as well .
A veteran of the Pentagon turf wars will feel like a kindergartner when he encounters the rivalries that exist in the Arab military headquarters .
Taking responsibility for a policy , operation , status , or training program rarely occurs .
U.S. trainers can find it very frustrating when they repeatedly encounter Arab officers placing blame for unsuccessful operations or programs on the U.S. equipment or some other outside source .
A high rate of non-operational U.S. equipment is blamed on a " lack of spare parts " — pointing a finger at an unresponsive U.S. supply system despite the fact that American trainers can document ample supplies arriving in country and disappearing in a malfunctioning supply system .
( Such criticism was never caustic or personal and often so indirect and politely delivered that it was n't until after a meeting that oblique references were understood . )
This imperative works even at the most exalted levels .
During the Kuwait war , Iraqi forces took over the town of Khafji in northeast Saudi Arabia after the Saudis had evacuated the place .
General Khalid bin Sultan , the Saudi ground forces commander , requested a letter from General Norman Schwarzkopf , stating it was the U.S. general who ordered an evacuation from the Saudi town .
23
And in his account of the Khafji battle , General Bin Sultan predictably blames the Americans for the Iraqi occupation of the town .
24
In reality the problem was that the light Saudi forces in the area left the battlefield .
25 The Saudis were in fact outgunned and outnumbered by the Iraqi unit approaching Khafji but Saudi pride required that foreigners be blamed .
As for equipment , a vast cultural gap exists between the U.S. and Arab maintenance and logistics systems .
The Arab difficulties with U.S. equipment are not , as sometimes simplistically believed , a matter of " Arabs do n't do maintenance , " but something much deeper .
The American concept of a weapons system does not convey easily .
A weapons system brings with it specific maintenance and logistics procedures , policies , and even a philosophy , all of them based on U.S. culture , with its expectations of a certain educational level , sense of small unit responsibility , tool allocation , and doctrine .
Tools that would be allocated to a U.S. battalion ( a unit of some 600 - 800 personnel ) would most likely be found at a much higher level — probably two or three echelons higher — in an Arab army .
The expertise , initiative and , most importantly , the trust indicated by delegation of responsibility to a lower level are rare .
The U.S. equipment and its maintenance are predicated on a concept of repair at the lowest level and therefore require delegation of authority .
Without the needed tools , spare parts , or expertise available to keep equipment running , and loathe to report bad news to his superiors , the unit commander looks for scapegoats .
All this explains why I many times heard in Egypt that U.S. weaponry is " too delicate . "
I have observed many in - country U.S. survey teams : invariably , hosts make the case for acquiring the most modern of military hardware and do everything to avoid issues of maintenance , logistics , and training .
They obfuscate and mislead to such an extent that U.S. teams , no matter how earnest their sense of mission , find it nearly impossible to help .
More generally , Arab reluctance to be candid about training deficiencies makes it extremely difficult for foreign advisors properly to support instruction or assess training needs .
Combined Arms Operations
A lack of cooperation is most apparent in the failure of all Arab armies to succeed at combined arms operations .
A regular Jordanian army infantry company , for example , is man - for - man as good as a comparable Israeli company ; at battalion level , however , the coordination required for combined arms operations , with artillery , air , and logistics support , is simply absent .
Indeed , the higher the echelon , the greater the disparity .
This results from infrequent combined arms training ; when it does take place , it is intended to impress visitors ( which it does — the dog - and - pony show is usually done with uncommon gusto and theatrical talent ) rather than provide real training .
This problem results from three main factors .
First , the well - known lack of trust among Arabs for anyone outside their own family adversely affects offensive operations .
26 Exceptions to this pattern are limited to elite units ( which throughout the Arab world have the same duty — to protect the regime , rather than the country ) .
In a culture in which almost every sphere of human endeavor , including business and social relationships , is based on a family structure , this orientation is also present in the military , particularly in the stress of battle .
Offensive action , basically , consists of fire and maneuver .
The maneuver element must be confident that supporting units or arms are providing covering fire .
If there is a lack of trust in that support , getting troops moving forward against dug - in defenders is possible only by officers getting out front and leading , something that has not been a characteristic of Arab leadership .
Second , the complex mosaic system of peoples creates additional problems for training , as rulers in the Middle East make use of the sectarian and tribal loyalties to maintain power .
The ' Alawi minority controls Syria , East Bankers control Jordan , Sunnis control Iraq , and Nejdis control Saudi Arabia .
This has direct implications for the military , where sectarian considerations affect assignments and promotions .
Some minorities ( such the Circassians in Jordan or the Druze in Syria ) tie their well - being to the ruling elite and perform critical protection roles ; others ( such as the Shi'a of Iraq ) are excluded from the officer corps .
In any case , the assignment of officers based on sectarian considerations works against assignments based on merit .
The same lack of trust operates at the interstate level , where Arab armies exhibit very little trust of each other , and with good reason .
The blatant lie Gamal Abdel Nasser told King Husayn in June 1967 to get him into the war against Israel — that the Egyptian air force was over Tel Aviv ( when most of its planes had been destroyed ) — was a classic example of deceit .
27 Sadat 's disingenuous approach to the Syrians to entice them to enter the war in October 1973 was another ( he told them that the Egyptians were planning total war , a deception which included using a second set of operational plans intended only for Syrian eyes ) .
28 With this sort of history , it is no wonder that there is very little cross or joint training among Arab armies and very few command exercises .
During the 1967 war , for example , not a single Jordanian liaison officer was stationed in Egypt , nor were the Jordanians forthcoming with the Egyptian command .
29
Third , Middle Eastern rulers routinely rely on balance - of - power techniques to maintain their authority .
30
They use competing organizations , duplicate agencies , and coercive structures dependent upon the ruler 's whim .
This makes building any form of personal power base difficult , if not impossible , and keeps the leadership apprehensive and off - balance , never secure in its careers or social position .
The same applies within the military ; a powerful chairman of the joint chiefs is inconceivable .
Joint commands are paper constructs that have little actual function .
Leaders look at joint commands , joint exercises , combined arms , and integrated staffs very cautiously for all Arab armies are a double - edged sword .
One edge points toward the external enemy and the other toward the capital .
The land forces are at once a regime - maintenance force and threat at the same time .
No Arab ruler will allow combined operations or training to become routine ; the usual excuse is financial expense , but that is unconvincing given their frequent purchase of hardware whose maintenance costs they cannot afford .
In fact , combined arms exercises and joint staffs create familiarity , soften rivalries , erase suspicions , and eliminate the fragmented , competing organizations that enable rulers to play off rivals against one another .
This situation is most clearly seen in Saudi Arabia , where the land forces and aviation are under the minister of defense , Prince Sultan , while the National Guard is under Prince Abdullah , the deputy prime minister and crown prince .
In Egypt , the Central Security Forces balance the army .
In Iraq and Syria , the Republican Guard does the balancing .
Politicians actually create obstacles to maintain fragmentation .
For example , obtaining aircraft from the air force for army airborne training , whether it is a joint exercise or a simple administrative request for support of training , must generally be coordinated by the heads of services at the ministry of defense ; if a large number of aircraft are involved , this probably requires presidential approval .
Military coups may be out of style , but the fear of them remains strong .
Any large - scale exercise of land forces is a matter of concern to the government and is closely observed , particularly if live ammunition is being used .
In Saudi Arabia a complex system of clearances required from area military commanders and provincial governors , all of whom have differing command channels to secure road convoy permission , obtaining ammunition , and conducting exercises , means that in order for a coup to work , it would require a massive amount of loyal conspirators .
Arab regimes have learned how to be coup - proof .
Security and Paranoia
Arab regimes classify virtually everything vaguely military .
Information the U.S. military routinely publishes ( about promotions , transfers , names of unit commanders , and unit designations ) is top secret in Arabic - speaking countries .
To be sure , this does make it more difficult for the enemy to construct an accurate order of battle , but it also feeds the divisive and compartmentalized nature of the military forces .
The obsession with security
can reach ludicrous lengths .
Prior to the 1973 war , Sadat was surprised to find that within two weeks of the date he had ordered the armed forces be ready for war , his minister of war , General Muhammad Sadiq , had failed to inform his immediate staff of the order .
Should a war , Sadat wondered , be kept secret from the very people expected to fight it ?
31
One can expect to have an Arab counterpart or key contact to be changed without warning and with no explanation as to his sudden absence .
This might well be simply a transfer a few doors down the way , but the vagueness of it all leaves foreigners with dire scenarios — scenarios that might be true .
And it is best not to inquire too much ; advisors or trainers who seem overly inquisitive may find their access to host military information or facilities limited .
The presumed close U.S. - Israel relationship , thought to be operative at all levels , aggravates and complicates this penchant for secrecy .
Arabs believe that the most mundane details about them are somehow transmitted to the Mossad via a secret hotline .
This explains why a U.S. advisor with Arab forces is likely to be asked early and often about his opinion of the " Palestine problem , " then subjected to monologues on the presumed Jewish domination of the United States .
Indifference to Safety
In terms of safety measures , there is a general laxness , a seeming carelessness and indifference to training accidents , many of which could have been prevented by minimal efforts .
To the ( perhaps overly ) safety - conscious Americans , Arab societies appear indifferent to casualties and show a seemingly lackadaisical approach to training safety .
There are a number of explanations for this .
Some would point to the inherent fatalism within Islam,32 and certainly anyone who has spent considerable time in Arab taxis would lend credence to that theory , but perhaps the reason is less religiously based and more a result of political culture .
As any military veteran knows , the ethos of a unit is set at the top ; or , as the old saying has it , units do those things well that the boss cares about .
When the top political leadership displays a complete lack of concern for the welfare of its soldiers , such attitudes percolate down through the ranks .
Exhibit A was the betrayal of Syrian troops fighting Israel in the Golan in 1967 : having withdrawn its elite units , the Syrian government knowingly broadcast the falsehood that Israeli troops had captured the town of Kuneitra , which would have put them behind the largely conscript Syrian army still in position .
The leadership took this step to pressure the great powers to impose a truce , though it led to a panic by the Syrian troops and the loss of the Golan Heights .
33
Conclusion
It would be difficult to exaggerate the cultural gulf separating American and Arab military cultures .
In every significant area , American military advisors find students who enthusiastically take in their lessons and then resolutely fail to apply them .
The culture they return to — the culture of their own armies in their own countries — defeats the intentions with which they took leave of their American instructors .
When they had an influence on certain Arab military establishments , the Soviets reinforced their clients ' cultural traits far more than , in more recent years , Americans were able to .
Like the Arabs ' , the Soviets ' military culture was driven by political fears bordering on paranoia .
The steps taken to control the sources ( real or imagined ) of these fears , such as a rigidly centralized command structure , were readily understood by Arab political and military elites .
The Arabs , too , felt an affinity for the Soviet officer class 's contempt for ordinary soldiers and the Soviet military hierarchy 's distrust of a well - developed , well - appreciated , well - rewarded NCO corps .
Arab political culture is based on a high degree of social stratification , very much like that of the defunct Soviet Union and very much unlike the upwardly mobile , meritocratic , democratic United States .
Arab officers do not see any value in sharing information among themselves , let alone with their men .
In this they follow the example of their political leaders , who not only withhold information from their own allies , but routinely deceive them .
Training in Arab armies reflects this : rather than prepare as much as possible for the multitude of improvised responsibilities that are thrown up in the chaos of battle , Arab soldiers , and their officers , are bound in the narrow functions assigned them by their hierarchy .
That this renders them less effective on the battlefield , let alone places their lives at greater risk , is scarcely of concern , whereas , of course , these two issues are dominant in the American military culture , and are reflected in American military training .
Change is unlikely to come until it occurs in the larger Arab political culture , although the experience of other societies ( including our own ) suggests that the military can have a democratizing influence on the larger political culture , as officers bring the lessons of their training first into their professional environment , then into the larger society .
It obviously makes a big difference , however , when the surrounding political culture is not only avowedly democratic ( as are many Middle Eastern states ) , but functionally so .
Until Arab politics begin to change at fundamental levels , Arab armies , whatever the courage or proficiency of individual officers and men , are unlikely to acquire the range of qualities which modern fighting forces require for success on the battlefield .
For these qualities depend on inculcating respect , trust , and openness among the members of the armed forces at all levels , and this is the marching music of modern warfare that Arab armies , no matter how much they emulate the corresponding steps , do not want to hear .
Norvell De Atkine , a U.S. Army retired colonel with eight years residence in Lebanon , Jordan , and Egypt , and a graduate degree in Arab studies from the American University of Beirut , is currently instructing U.S. Army personnel assigned to Middle Eastern areas .

ABIDJAN , Ivory Coast , Sept. 28 — It was his infant son ’s cries , gasping and insistent , that first woke Salif Oudrawogol one night last month .
The smell hit him moments later , wafting into the family ’s hut , a noxious mélange reminiscent of rotten eggs , garlic and petroleum .
Mr. Oudrawogol went outside to investigate .
Beside the family ’s compound , near his manioc and corn fields , he saw a stinking slick of black sludge .
“ The smell was so bad we were afraid , ” Mr. Oudrawogol said .
“ It burned our noses and eyes . ”
Over the next few days , the skin of his 6 - month - old son , Salam , bloomed with blisters , which burst into weeping sores all over his body .
The whole family suffered headaches , nosebleeds and stomach aches .
How that slick , a highly toxic cocktail of petrochemical waste and caustic soda , ended up in Mr. Oudrawogol ’s backyard in a suburb north of Abidjan is a dark tale of globalization .
It came from a Greek - owned tanker flying a Panamanian flag and leased by the London branch of a Swiss trading corporation whose fiscal headquarters are in the Netherlands .
Safe disposal in Europe would have cost about $ 300,000 , or perhaps twice that , counting the cost of delays .
But because of decisions and actions made not only here but also in Europe , it was dumped on the doorstep of some of the world ’s poorest people .
Once again , this time for a report commissioned by the broadcaster itself , the ostensibly neutral BBC stands accused of a sneaky preference for dressing to the left .
Much of the evidence for this is , at best , wobbly , but one witness employee , Washington correspondent Justin Webb , needs to be heard .
The organisation , he peeved , is anti-American ; it treats the US with scorn and derision and accords it ' no moral weight ' .
He is , thus far at least , correct .
The last 10 years have seen American stories relegated to a slew of ' and finally ' freak shows , a vast country 's talents reduced to synchronised gas - guzzling as choreographed by Paris Hilton .
The trouble is that it is not just the BBC ; disdaining Americans has become a national sport , regardless of the fact that it requires the skill of all sports involving fish , guns and barrels .
Everybody knows the check - list , only their priorities vary : stem cells , lethal injections , indelicate warfare , creationism , the second amendment , Wal - Mart , reproductive choice , pointy white hoods , chewing tobacco and obscene chocolate .
We may add personal quibbles : that they call this paper The London Observer , on the solipsistic basis that if all their newspapers are mono - citied , then so must be everyone's .
Or that now they finally screen Formula One , they go to ad breaks during clusters of pitstops because , apparently , stationary cars are boring .
Jeez .
And yet , still , the view looks different from here .
Here , in the house we bought a decade ago , a purchase then widely envied but news of which is now greeted in Britain with rudely choleric disbelief , especially given that we are in Georgia , not even the settlements of Tina Brown ! , I heard Justin Webb 's lone but plaintive cry and felt a comradely sadness .
The international shimmy from anti-Bush sentiments to blanket anti-American sentiments has been widely noted , especially since the President was elected a second time and so , say critics , the refusal of the nation to bow to experience means not just they have only themselves to blame but that we , by extension , may play the blame game too .
Whatever the logic of that , however , it sits uncomfortably in comparison with a British electorate who had three doses of ' experience ' before buying Blair another shot ; further , the more than half of the US who did not vote for Bush express a visceral dismay at the electoral consequence with a passion that far outweighs the languid , late - night punditry of the more than half who did not vote for Blair .
The price of democracy , they queue to tell you here , is how often it sucks .
That these people , by the tens of millions , should be damned with the same contempt deservedly dished to fundamentalist fools ( cheering local bumper sticker : ' The Christian right is neither ' ) is not fair ; nor does it serve either their or our better interests .
For here in flyover America , far from the hotspots better known to foreigners - Noo York , Washington , La-la - is where , and how , most Americans live .
And for all that much of it is indeed as corny as Kansas in August , a great deal more is attractive and , frankly , ripe for the copying .
The social mobility yearned for by , say , Alan Johnson thrives here .
Not one of our wealthier friends was born that way and both cause and result of this is a genuine , albeit incomplete erosion of what the British think of as class .
The southern oil billionaire 's accent is the same as his pool - boy 's ; when I watched an eminent attorney in court , he asked : ' Woz y'all workin ' that day ? ' - not because he was thick , inarticulate or patronising his witness , but because they both speak like that .
We share casual suppers with the first from Daddy 's farm to make college and who now holds an engineering doctorate , along with a feisty pizza waitress , a salvage diver , an international bestselling novelist , a lesbian runaway from the Moonies , the local fire lieutenant and a flight attendant who has an MA , Eng lit , but chose her job because she likes to get out more : regrettably , an inconceivable grouping in north London .
The lust for wealth that we love to mock is admittedly real and , if achieved , enjoyed .
But by the same token , an appreciation of money ensures that nurses , teachers and firefighters are - relative to the UK - well - paid .
It is also a sine qua non that if you have , you give ; charity is endemic , not spasmodically wrung out of you by rock stars on a roll .
If you have n't money , the insurance companies will stiff you , but your neighbours , by and large , will not .
A lawyer friend recently had a client unable to pay her bill so , for an agreed eight weeks , she found a home - cooked Sunday lunch nestling in her front porch .
Which might be altogether too Atticus Finch for your taste , but it does n't happen in Basingstoke , and you may decide if that is Basingstoke 's loss .
God - bothering is , of course , a pain .
But at least it is kept out of state schools so no parental piety - real or otherwise - may snaffle a choicer education from a more deserving child .
And speaking of children : we only hear of the one who runs amok in West Virginia ; from the other 58 million , we have lessons to learn .
Even in deprived , no - go - after - dark downtown , teenage boys stand to look you in the eye , call you ma'am and have no familiarity with the language of the monosyllabic grunt - if only because their mamas , white and black , will have it no other way , not because the government is sponsoring ' initiatives ' on ' respect ' .
Too Pollyanna a picture ?
Missed out the killing fields of Detroit ?
Perhaps .
But even if none of the above negates any of the problem issues on your list or mine , it does not mean than the pros of America are less real - or less evident , if you take the time to look - than the cons .
Moreover , the perpetual sneering from overseas is having a sadly dispiriting effect on people who have achieved , in many areas , very much more than we have .
They deserve a lot better .
We deserve a little humility .
The BBC deserves its slap .

Conservatives like to divide judges into liberal “ activists ” and conservative nonactivists who interpret the law rather than making it .
Anyone who follows the courts knows that conservative judges are as activist as liberal judges just for different causes .
A new study of Supreme Court voting patterns confirms this and suggests that the conservative Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas are actually more activist than their liberal colleagues .
Lori Ringhand , a professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law , examined the voting records of the Supreme Court justices from 1994 to 2005 .
Because judicial activism is a vague concept , she applied a reasonable , objective standard .
In the study , which is forthcoming in Constitutional Commentary , justices were considered to have voted in an activist way when they voted to overturn a federal or state law , or one of the court ’s own precedents .
The conservative justices were far more willing than the liberals to strike down federal laws  clearly an activist stance , since they were substituting their own judgment for that of the people ’s elected representatives in Congress .
Justice Thomas voted to overturn federal laws in 34 cases and Justice Scalia in 31 , compared with just 15 for Justice Stephen Breyer .
When state laws were at issue , the liberals were more activist .
Add up the two categories , and the conservatives and liberals turned out to be roughly equal .
But Justices Thomas and Scalia , who are often held out as models of nonactivism , voted to strike down laws in more of these cases than Justice Breyer and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , the court ’s two Clinton appointees .
By the third measure , overturning the court ’s own precedents ( for which data were available only up to 2000 ) , the conservatives were far more activist .
Justice Thomas voted to overturn precedent 23 times and Justice Scalia 19 times , while the court ’s four liberals did so in 10 cases or fewer .

IRAQ IS OVER .
Iraq has not yet begun .
These are two conclusions from the American debate about Iraq .
Iraq is over insofar as the American public has decided that most U.S. troops should leave .
In a Gallup poll earlier this month , 71 % favored “ removing all U.S. troops from Iraq by April 1 of next year , except for a limited number that would be involved in counter - terrorism efforts . ”
CNN ’s veteran political analyst , Bill Schneider , observes that in the latter years of the Vietnam War , the American public ’s basic attitude could be summarized as “ either win or get out . ”
He argues that it ’s the same with Iraq .
Most Americans have now concluded that the U.S. is not winning .
So : Get out .
Because this is a democracy , their elected representatives are following where the people lead .
Although the Democrats did not get the result they wanted in an all - night marathon on the floor of the Senate , from Tuesday to Wednesday this week , no one in Washington doubts that this is the way the wind blows .
Publicly , there ’s still a sharp split along party lines , but leading Republicans are already breaking ranks to float their own phased troop - reduction plans .
President Bush says he ’s determined to give the commanding general in Iraq , David Petraeus , the troop levels he asks for when he reports back in September , and the White House may hold the line for now against a Democrat - controlled Congress .
Leading Republican contenders for the presidency are still talking tough .
However , the most outspoken protagonist of hanging in there to win in Iraq , John McCain , has seen his campaign nosedive .
Even if the next president is a hard - line Republican , all the current Washington betting will be confounded if he does not , at the very least , rapidly reduce the number of U.S. troops in Iraq .
After all , that ’s what the American people plainly say they want .
The American people ’s verdict is remarkably sharp on other aspects of the Iraq debacle .
In a poll for CNN , 54 % said the United States ’ action in Iraq was not morally justified .
In one for CBS , 51 % endorsed the assessment — shared by most of the experts — that U.S. involvement in Iraq was creating more , not fewer , terrorists hostile to the United States .
If once Americans were blind , they now can see .
For all its plenitude of faith , this is a reality - based nation .
So Iraq is over .
But Iraq has not yet begun .
Not yet begun in terms of the consequences for Iraq itself , the Middle East , the United States ’ own foreign policy and its reputation in the world .
The most probable consequence of rapid U.S. withdrawal from Iraq in its present condition is a further bloodbath , with even larger refugee flows and the effective dismemberment of the country .
Already , about 2 million Iraqis have fled across the borders , and more than 2 million are internally displaced .
Now a pained and painstaking study from the Brookings Institution argues that what its authors call “ soft partition ” — the peaceful , voluntary transfer of an estimated 2 million to 5 million Iraqis into distinct Kurdish , Sunni and Shiite regions , under close U.S. military supervision — would be the lesser evil .
The lesser evil , that is , assuming that all goes according to plan and that Americans are prepared to allow their troops to stay in sufficient numbers to accomplish that thankless job — two implausible assumptions .
A greater evil is more likely .
In an article for the Web magazine Open Democracy , Middle East specialist Fred Halliday spells out some regional consequences .
Besides the effective destruction of the Iraqi state , these include the revitalizing of militant Islamism and enhancement of the international appeal of the Al Qaeda brand ; the eruption , for the first time in modern history , of internecine war between Sunni and Shiite , “ a trend that reverberates in other states of mixed confessional composition ” ; the alienation of most sectors of Turkish politics from the West and the stimulation of authoritarian nationalism there ; the strengthening of a nuclear - hungry Iran ; and a new regional rivalry pitting the Islamic Republic of Iran and its allies , including Syria , Hezbollah and Hamas , against Saudi Arabia , Egypt and Jordan .
For the United States , the world is now , as a result of the Iraq war , a more dangerous place .
At the end of 2002 , what is sometimes tagged “ Al Qaeda Central ” in Afghanistan had been virtually destroyed , and there was no Al Qaeda in Iraq .
In 2007 , there is an Al Qaeda in Iraq , parts of the old Al Qaeda are creeping back into Afghanistan and there are Al Qaeda emulators spawning elsewhere , notably in Europe .
Osama bin Laden ’s plan was to get the U.S. to overreact and overreach itself .
With the invasion of Iraq , Bush fell slap - bang into that trap .
The U.S. government ’s own latest National Intelligence Estimate , released this week , suggests that Al Qaeda in Iraq is now among the most significant threats to the security of the American homeland .
The U.S. has probably not yet fully woken up to the appalling fact that , after a long period in which the first motto of its military was “ no more Vietnams , ” it faces another Vietnam .
There are many important differences , but the basic result is similar :
The mightiest military in the world fails to achieve its strategic goals and is , in the end , politically defeated by an economically and technologically inferior adversary .
Even if there are no scenes of helicopters evacuating Americans from the roof of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad , there will surely be some totemic photographic image of national humiliation as the U.S. struggles to extract its troops .
Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo have done terrible damage to the U.S. reputation for being humane ; this defeat will convince more people around the world that it is not even that powerful .
And Bin Laden , still alive , will claim another victory over the death - fearing weaklings of the West .
In history , the most important consequences are often the unintended ones .
We do not yet know the longer - term unintended consequences of Iraq .
Maybe there is a silver lining hidden somewhere in this cloud .
But as far as the human eye can see , the likely consequences of Iraq range from the bad to the catastrophic .
Looking back over a quarter of a century of chronicling current affairs , I cannot recall a more comprehensive and avoidable man-made disaster .

Mr Schaeuble wants to prevent Muslim alienation in Europe
Wolfgang Schaeuble suggested that the EU should promote the training of imams to encourage Muslim leaders who were comfortable with European values .
He compared parts of the Islamic world to pre-Enlightenment Europe , and criticised both the burka veil and traditional Muslim attitudes to women .
He pledged to use his country 's EU presidency to promote integration .
He wanted training for imams that could " strengthen those who can live with the European rule of law , universal rights and the achievements of the Enlightenment " , he said , referring to the 17th Century European movement that put reason and universal rights ahead of tradition .
" There are still parts of the Muslim world where historical enlightenment still needs to be implemented , " he told Brussels - based journalists on Thursday .
" We should not be arrogant but only helpful .
After all , Christianity waged terrible conflicts for a few centuries until the process of Enlightenment took root . "
He echoed senior British politician Jack Straw when he said he thought the all - over burka worn by some Muslim women was " an element that hinders communication " .
But he said he did not believe it was politicians ' role to decide what people should wear .
However , equal rights for women was a universal principle that should be defended everywhere , he said , not just " some peculiarity " of Europe .

Report : Cunningham admits soliciting bribes , prostitutes in exchange for earmarks RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday July 18 , 2007 Print This Email This Disgraced former Rep. Randy " Duke " Cunningham described to the FBI an elaborate bribes - for - favors scheme in which he solicited cash and prostitutes from defense contractors in exchange for wasteful federal earmarks , Copley News Service reports .
The San Diego Republican was interviewed by the FBI and other investigators in February at the federal prison in Tucson , Ariz . , where he is serving more than eight years after admitting accepting $ 2.4 million in bribes and gifts .
The depiction of Cunningham that emerges from the interviews , an 11 - page summary of which were obtained by Copley News Service , shows he was the mastermind behind the quid pro quo arrangement .
" Cunningham was very much the initiator of his corrupt actions , demanding bribes , accepting envelopes with cash and displaying an insatiable appetite for more money , more cars , more drink , more fine food and more expensive goods , " report George E. Condon Jr. and Marcus Stern .
Among Cunningham 's admissions were that defense contractor Brent Wilkes provided the then - congressman with prostitutes during a vacation in Hawaii .
Cunningham told the FBI that he was upset Wilkes got the " younger and cuter " call girl and said he was " somewhat embarrassed on this occasion because he had some difficulty in completing intercourse . "
Wilkes faces 30 counts in two separate indictments , including charges that he gave Cunningham $ 600,000 in cash and gifts in exchange for more than $ 80 million in federal defense contracts .
His trials are expected to begin this fall .
The interviews paint a picture that contrasts sharply with the image Cunningham sought to create after his downfall .
In a letter released after his conviction , he said he was unable to resist the coaxing of corrupt defense contractors and merely accepted " gifts " but never sold his office .
On the contrary , Cunningham admitted to the FBI that he was intimately involved in soliciting bribes from the contractors .
He and Wilkes jointly concocted a cover story that allowed Wilkes to give Cunningham $ 100,000 .
Ostensibly , Wilkes purchased Cunningham 's boat with the money , but Wilkes knew there would be " no actual change in ownership " of the yacht , according to the FBI interviews .
He also admitted demanding regular envelopes full of cash , which he called " maintenance money , " that were delivered at least once to his office at the US Capitol .
A member of the House defense appropriations subcommittee and Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , Cunningham was well placed to deliver federal dollars to his benefactors .
He admitted misleading congressional ethics officials and working around objections of other lawmakers to secure the multimillion - dollar earmarks .
" Cunningham stated that , by 2000 , he had already been receiving numerous benefits from Wilkes that included such things as vacation trips , liquor , cash / maintenance money , " the FBI interview summary states .
" According to Cunningham , in return for these benefits , he had been helping Wilkes / ADCS in their efforts to secure government contracts . "
Chest fridge
Using vertical doors in refrigeration devices is an act against the Nature of Cold Air .
Understanding and cooperating with Nature rather than acting against it leads to much better efficiency .
My chest fridge ( Vestfrost freezer turned into a fridge ) consumes about 0.1 kWh a day .
It works only about 2 minutes per hour .
At all other times it is perfectly quiet and consumes no power whatsoever .
My wind / solar system batteries and power - demand - sensing inverter simply love it .
It is obvious that a truly energy efficient fridge does not cost any more money than a mediocre one .
It actually costs less .
It also has amazing food - preserving performance becuse temperature fluctuations in its interior are naturally minimized .
So - WHY mediocre food - spoiling fridges are being made ?
WHO makes decisions to manufacture them ?
Who awards them " stars " and other misleading awards ?
Why people continue to buy and use energy wasting and food - spoiling devices ?
Does anyone care about understanding anything ?
Nearly every household on Earth has a fridge that totally wastes at least 1 kWh of energy a day ( 365 kWh a year ) .
How much reduction in greenhouse emissions can we achieve by banning just ONE inefficient household device in just ONE country ?
How many politicians debating for how many years will it take to achieve such a ban ?
Rather than waiting for someone to do something I would like to volunteer to supply modified chest freezers and / or freezer modification kits to environmentally conscious people of Australia .
Let ’s do something in the right direction right now .
Chest fridge that consumes about 0.1 kWh per day .
Yes , only about 100 Wh per day .
If I connected my chest fridge to the power grid $ 5 would pay for the entire year of using it .
Note the electronic thermostat on the wall and the energy meter at the power point .

Court of Appeals Judge Richard Posner has become one of the leading advocates of drastically expanded federal police powers as a response to the terrorist threat .
He advocates the creation of a domestic spy agency ( an internal CIA / KGB / Stassi - type agency to monitor domestic activities ) ; expanding the group of citizens subjected to warrantless eavesdropping to include even include " [ i ] nnocent people , such as unwitting neighbors of terrorists " ; allowing warrantless eavesdropping even if it violates the law ; and stripping federal courts of their ability to enforce legal limits on the President 's national security powers .
Posner was interviewed yesterday by Glenn Reynolds and Reynolds ' wife , Helen , concerning the topics covered in Posner 's new book , Not a Suicide Pact : The Constitution in a Time of National Emergency .
The podcast interview is here .
The two Reynolds -- credit where it 's due -- actually do a decent job of asking Posner the right questions , which allow Posner to expound what are his truly radical theories of constitutional interpretation .
What is amazing is that self - proclaimed " conservatives " are celebrating Posners ' views even though those views are exactly those which conservatives have always claimed to be against .
Posner 's core argument is that the threat of terrorism is so " very great " and " very novel " -- " sui generis " -- that the Constitution must be intepreted differently than it ever was before in order to deal with the threat ( there is no transcript available -- all quotes are from my listening to the podcast ) .
Posner repeatedly claims in the interview that " the Constitution is flexible " and he even says that it is a " , not shrink wrap . "
Thus , we " have to interpret the Constitution in a way to enable us to cope with unanticipated dangers .
" Posner 's relentless characterization of the Constitution as this amorphous , evolving document which must be shaped and molded by political events led Reynolds to ask the right if not obvious question -- is n't Posner advocating the very theory of a " living , breathing Constitution " which conservatives have long claimed to despise , even consider tyrannical ?
Posner paused and stuttered quite a bit after being asked that question , and then admitted , quite astonishingly , that he " had n't thought about that " painfully obvious point before .
But he then told Reynolds that he 's " right " about the fact that he , Posner , has an elastic view of the Constitution -- that it is a " flexible " document .
Posner then justified that view by essentially denegrating the Constitution as obsolete and useless in light of this grave new threat .
The Constitution is nothing but " an 18th Century document , " Posner complained , and " the notion that [ the Founders ] had the answers to 20th Cenutry problems . . . is , I think , Posner may or may not be right about the claim that terrorism requires changes to the system of constitutional protections guaranteed to Americans by that document .
But he is self - evidently and dangerously wrong to suggest that we can just get rid of constitutional structures by whimsically interpreting them away at will as obsolete in light of new political developments .
The Founders obviously recognized that subsequent events or re-assessments may require changes to the Constitution -- and they therefore provided within the document several procedures for amending it .
If Posner is right that the U.S. Constitution should be radically changed because of some Islamic extremists , then those changes can be effectuated only through the amendment process , not by judges deciding on their own that the terrorism threat necessitates an abridgement of liberties .
Posner is expressly advocating that the Constitution be changed without complying with any of those procedures -- simply by having judges " interpret " the Constitution differently in light of their view of political events and the terrorist threat .
George Bush advanced the same view of the living , breathing Constitution ( albeit in a much more muddled way ) when he criticized Judge Taylor 's ruling by claiming that supporters of her decision " do not understand the nature of the world in which we live " -- as though Constitutional protections guaranteed to American citizens by the Bill of Rights are not to be discerned from that document , but instead , by one 's abstract understanding " of the world in which we live .
"
In one sense , this is nothing new .
In order to defend the Bush administration 's lawlessness , self - proclaimed conservatives have been advocating legal theories which are the very antithesis of the strict constructionism and originalism they claim to espouse .
They insist , for instance , that the President has the power to engage in warrantless eavesdropping on Americans under Article II , even though Article II mentions not a word about surveillance or eavesdropping ( such powers instead presumably " emanate " from the " penumbra " of the Executive 's generalized Commander - in - Chief powers ) .
Similarly , they contend that the 2001 AUMF " implicitly " repealed eavesdropping limitations imposed by FISA even though that statute also failed to say a word about eavesdropping , surveillance or FISA .
But Posner is nothing if not candid , and so he much more explicitly argues that the Constitution should be a clay - like instrument that can be shaped and changed by judges based on the whimsical political events of the day .
Posner is a consistent theorist -- he requires a thorough intellectual justification for his conclusions -- and he knows that the Constitution as it has been understood and interpreted simply bars the extremist policies he wants , such as prolonged periods of lawless detention of U.S. citizens and his the massively expanded warrantless domestic surveillance which he advocates .
So Posner does what he is intellectually forced to do -- he argues that all of those Constitutional limitations can simply be done away with , banished with a magic wand , due to the terrorist threat , and he claims that this would happen if only judges had a better understanding ( like he does ) of just how grave this threat is .
But arguing that the Constitution should be understood differently in light of contemporary political developments supposedly " unanticipated " by the Founders is precisely the legal theory which conservatives claim to despise .
Yet they nonetheless cheer on Posner , because Posner is advocating drastically expanded domestic police powers , and that -- rather than any limitations on judicial power or abstract theories of judicial restraint -- is what the new " conservatives " want most .
And as their otherwise inexplicable support for Posner demonstrates , they do n't really care how that 's accomplished .
German Defense Minister Franz Josef Jung said Friday he was rejecting a request from Kabul for 19 German Army soldiers to move to the country 's embattled south with a Afghan battalion they have been training for the past few months .
Thomas Raabe , spokesman for the minister , said in Berlin the assistance was not an emergency and therefore was not covered by the current German parliamentary mandate authorizing over 3,000 troops currently stationed in Afghanistan as a part of a NATO - led international peacekeeping force ( ISAF ) .
Germany 's ground troops are only authorized to operate in Kabul and the north of Afghanistan , though the German air force flies reconnaissance missions above the fighting in the south .
German peacekeepers in Afghanistan are largely confined to the capital Kabul
Kabul had urgently asked for the 19 Germans as part of an Afghan Army infantry battalion based in Kundus in the north which is being redeployed to Kandahar , a province which is the scene of intense fighting between alliance forces and a resurgent Taliban .
The 19 Germans are among 60 German soldiers selected to train the Afghan unit .
A German television channel , ZDF , has reported that the battalion is set to move out Saturday or Sunday .
Controversial request
Kabul 's request was bound to be a controversial one for the German government which until now has steadfastly maintained that it does not want its peacekeeping troops embroiled in the growing fighting in Afghanistan .
Germany has elite special forces in Afghanistan but has never disclosed where they operate , though it is generally believed that the KSK commandoes are in the south in direct conflict with Taliban forces .
Germany sent Tornado spy jets to Afghanistan last month
Germany 's parliament needs to approve any military or peacekeeping deployment of its troops .
The current Afghanistan mandate explicitly rules out German participation in combat missions .
Earlier last month , Germany sent six surveillance jets to Afghanistan -- amid misgivings among some opposition parties -- to photograph Taliban locations and support NATO forces on the ground .
Politicians want more open debate
On Friday , a few politicians raised doubts about the deployment and urged the government to openly discuss Afghanistan 's request for troops .
" My spontaneous reaction is that this request from Kabul is not covered by the parliamentary mandate for the ISAF deployment , " Karl Lamers , defense expert of the governing Christian Democratic Party ( CDU ) told the online site of Der Spiegel magazine .
Claudia Roth , head of the opposition Green party said Defense Minister Jung needed to inform parliament and the public about his decision .
" Such a request ( from Afghanistan ) belongs in the parliament and should not be clandestinely decided in the defense ministry , " Roth said .

ニセ科学対抗勢力としてはかなりの面子だと思われ。
ぱっと見た感想。かなり年齢層高め。ニセ科学に対するウェブの盛り上がりとは裏腹に、おじいさん率が高かった。男女比は6:4くらいか。会場はかなり混雑していて、立ち見もちらほらと。座ってみてる人もいましたね。
筆者は寝坊して菊池先生のしか聞けなかったのでちょっとだけ要旨をまとめてみます。
ニセ科学がなぜいけないか
社会的損失 経済的・時間的・人的損失…ようするに無駄、ってこと。徒労に終わるのを防止しなければいけない。 善意の無駄遣い
社会の非合理化 思考の単純化…結果のみを求める。プロセスを無視。
信じる側はどんな人 ？
科学的だか ら
科学ではまだ証明されていないが事実だと思う
信じたいから…このレベルまで来るとお好きにという気はしますが。
なぜ受けいれられるのか
科学的意匠の低さ・敷居の低さ…科学っぽいけど原理(みたいなもの)がわかりやすい。理解しやすい。
結果のわかりやすさ・思い切りの良さ 二分法的思考…ダメな物はとことんダメ、効くものはなんでも効く。ズバリいわれたい。江原・細木が流行るのもそのせいでは。
願望充足 こうなってほしい、と思うことを提案する。 特に何もしなくても良い。ただ " それ " をしたり、買ったりするだけで全て解決する。
スピリチュアルブー ム
江原・細木 言っている事は普通→受け入れやすい 気持ちを代弁してくれている→自分の考えというか気持ちを理由によって補強する。安心を得る。 説明原理としての前世・オーラ→これが科学になって間違った方向へいったのがニセ科学。
感想とか
まだもうちょっと喋ってらしたのですが、あんまりうまくレポートできてないですね…ニューエイジや、船井幸雄、水伝とか百匹目の猿の話もしてらっしゃいました。二分法的思考というのは別にニセ科学だけの問題ではなく、単にニセ科学という分野に現れてきているだけではないかと菊池先生はおっしゃっていました。
最後に菊池先生にホメオパシーが云々の話をしてたおばさんが居て、全否定されてちょっと凹んでらっしゃいました。でも…でも…となんとか納得しようとしてるのがもうなんとも…先生曰く、治った、という事実は確かにある。因果関係は科学では認められていない。それだけの事。個人的な体験を一般化しない事。一般化するには適切なプロセスを経る必要がある、などなど。
このような価値ある講演会ですが、おじいさん方が本当に科学リテラシを身に付けて帰るのかは正直謎です。最後に質問する機会が与えられたのですが、還元水と純水は違うのかーとか薬飲むときに飲む水は水道水か純水か？とか。そんな事は問題の本質じゃないだろうと思ったのですが、身近な例から入っていくのが正しいのかもしれませんからなんともかんとも。やらないよりは絶対にやった方がいい講演活動ですが、一人ひとり問いただすと凄い人が居そうな気がしました。
説得力より納得力、だそうです。信じたいものを信じちゃう。
あと個人的に聞いたんですが " ネットの盛り上がりに反して意外とご高齢の方が多いですね " と言った ら
やっぱりまだ既存メディアの影響力というのは果てしなく大きい。ある年齢層以上ではウェブを情報源にすることはほとんどない。ネットを使えてもヤフーくらいのもの。僕はYouTubeで自分の動画をみたけど。こういった講演会、新聞やテレビなどといったものの方がいわゆる一般市民に影響を与えることになるだろう。やっぱりテレビが一番いいんだけど、さすがにゴールデンは厳しいだろう。出れても「世界一受けたい授業」くらいか。(スポンサーとかもあるのでしょうね、と相槌)
ただあの時間帯で民放だと編集されるのが一番怖い。どこを切り取られるのかわからない。その点、「視点論点」というのはノーカットなので良かった。たまに怪しい人も出ますけどね。
ということでした 。
ウェブでの活動に際して嫌がらせ等はあんまりないのだが、既存メディアに出演するようになると嫌がらせが増えると。左巻先生は京都新聞で連載している時に、研究室に浄水器の販売会社の社長と会長が現れて、恫喝まがいの事をされたそうだ。どこから金もらっとんじゃワレ…的な。
天羽先生は裁判中。詳しい経緯は先生のウェブサイトで。
訴状 - http://atom11.phys.ocha.ac.jp/wwatch/claim/case01/index.html
ずっと噛み付いている反論サイト - ttp://www.minusionwater.com/
どうもこういう人らは嫌がらせには長けていて、研究室に抗議しにいくのではなくて、大学へ抗議するのだそうだ、内容証明郵便など用いて。すると大学の方からご注進みたいなのが行くと。あんまり事を荒立てないでね、と言われるそうな。

To fully reap this Manual you need to have a basic understanding of the Windows Registry
If you wants to know the basic of registry then go to Registry Tips page of this site .
Important Note : Before you read on , you need to keep one thing in mind .
Whenever you make changes to the Windows Registry you need to Refresh it before the changes take place .
Simply press F5 to refresh the registry and enable the changes .
If this does not work Restart your system .
1 ) Disabling Display of Drives in My Computer :
This is yet another trick you can play on your geek friend .
To disable the display of local or networked drives when you click My Computer go to : HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies \Explorer
Now in the right pane create a new DWORD item and name it NoDrives .
Now modify it 's value and set it to 3FFFFFF ( Hexadecimal ) Now press F5 to refresh .
When you click on My Computer , no drives will be shown .
To enable display of drives in My Computer , simply delete this DWORD item .
It 's .reg file is as follows : REGEDIT4 [ HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer ]
" NoDrives " =dword:03ffffff
2 ) Pop a banner each time Windows Boots :
To pop a banner which can contain any message you want to display just before a user is going to log on , go to the key : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion \WinLogon
Now create a new string Value in the right pane named LegalNoticeCaption and enter the value that you want to see in the Menu Bar .
Now create yet another new string value and name it : LegalNoticeText .
Modify it and insert the message you want to display each time Windows boots .
This can be effectively used to display the company 's private policy each time the user logs on to his NT box .
It 's .reg file would be : REGEDIT4 [ HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Winlogon ]
" LegalNoticeCaption " =" Caption here . "
3 ) Secure your Desktop Icons and Settings :
You can save your desktop settings and secure it from your nerdy friend by playing with the registry .
Simply launch the Registry Editor go to : HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies \Explorer
In the right pane create a new DWORD Value named NoSaveSettings and modify it 's value to 1 .
Refresh and restart for the settings to get saved .
4 ) Deleting System Options from the Start menu :
You can actually remove the Find and Run options from the start menu by performing a simple registry hack .
Again like always
Launch the registry editor and scroll down to the below key : HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software \Microsoft \Windows \CurrentVersion \Policies \Explorer Right - click on the right pane and select New , DWORD Value .
Name it NoFind .( To remove the RUN option name it NoRun ) .
Double - click the newly create DWORD to edit it 's value and enter 1 as its value .
This will disable the FIND option of the Start Menu and will also disable the default Shortcut key ( F3 for Find . )
To restore the Run or find command modify the value of the DWORD to 0 or simply Delete the DWORD value .
5 ) Cleaning Recent Docs Menu and the RUN MRU : The Recent Docs menu can be easily disabled by editing the Registry .
To do this go to the following Key : HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows \CurrentVersion \Policies \Explorer
Now in the right pane , create a new DWORD value by the name : NoRecentDocsMenu and set it 's value to 1 .
Restart Explorer to save the changes .
You can also clear the RUN MRU history .
All the listings are stored in the key : HKEY_USERS \.
Default \Software \Microsoft\Windows \CurrentVersion \Explorer\RunMRU
You can delete individual listings or the entire listing .
To delete History of Find listings go to : HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows \CurrentVersion \Explorer \Doc Find Spec MRU and delete .
6 ) Other Similar Useful Tricks : Launch Regedit and go to the following Registry Key : HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/CurrentVersion/Policies
Under this key , there will definitely be a key named explorer .
Now under this explorer key we can create new DWORD values and modify it 's value to 1 in order to impose the restriction .
If you want to remove the Restriction , then you can simply delete the respective DWORD values or instead change their values to 0 .
The following is a list of DWORD values that can be created under the Explorer Key- : NoDeletePrinter : Disables Deletion of already installed Printers NoAddPrinter : Disables Addition of new Printers NoRun : Disables or hides the Run Command NoSetFolders : Removes Folders from the Settings option on Start Menu ( Control Panel , Printers , Taskbar ) NoSetTaskbar : Removes Taskbar system folder from the Settings option on Start Menu NoFind : Removes the Find Tool ( Start > Find ) NoDrives : Hides and does not display any Drives in My Computer NoNetHood : Hides or removes the Network Neighborhood icon from the desktop NoDesktop : Hides all items including , file , folders and system folders from the Desktop NoClose : Disables Shutdown and prevents the user from normally shutting down Windows .
NoSaveSettings : Means to say , ' Do n't save settings on exit ' DisableRegistryTools : Disable Registry Editing Tools
( If you disable this option , the Windows Registry Editor ( regedit.exe ) too will not work . )
NoRecentDocsHistory : Removes Recent Document system folder from the Start Menu ( IE 4 and above ) ClearRecentDocsOnExit : Clears the Recent Documents system folder on Exit. Nolnternetlcon : Removes the Internet ( system folder ) icon from the Desktop Under the same key : HKEY_CURRENT_USER / Software / Microsoft / CurrentVersion / Policies you can create new subkeys other than the already existing Explorer key .
Now create a new key and name it System .
Under this new key , system we can create the following new DWORD values ( 1 for enabling the particular option and 0 for disabling the particular option ) : NODispCPL : Hides Control Panel
Hides Control Panel NoDispBackgroundPage : Hides Background page .
Hides Background page .
NoDispScrsavPage : Hides Screen Saver Page
Hides Screen Saver Page NoDispAppearancePage : Hides Appearance Page
Hides Appearance Page NoDispSettingsPage : Hides Settings Page
Hides Settings Page NoSecCPL : Disables Password Control Panel
Disables Password Control Panel NoPwdPage : Hides Password Change Page
Hides Password Change Page NoAdminPaqe : Hides Remote Administration Page
: Hides Remote Administration Page NoProfilePage : Hides User Profiles Page
Hides User Profiles Page NoDevMgrPage : Hides Device Manager Page
Hides Device Manager Page NoConfigPage : Hides Hardware Profiles Page
Hides Hardware Profiles Page NoFileSysPage : Hides File System Button
Hides File System Button NoVirtMemPage : Hides Virtual Memory Button Similarly , if we create a new subkey named WinOldApp , we can add the following DWORD values under it ( 1 for enabling the particular option and 0 for disabling the particular option ) : Disabled : Disable MS - DOS Prompt NoRealMode : Disable Single - Mode MS - DOS .

This is the proof that America is winning the " War on Terror " according to Mr. GW Bush .
Because the American administration continues to deny the deaths of their own soldiers , the freedom fighters of Iraq thought it necessary to video their activities as proof of the numbers that are falling .
Somehow I do n't think that the Fox channel is going to show this , do you ?
For those that do n't read Arabic , here are the numbers that fell in a two week period as shown in the footage .
156 killed .
and the rest were injured seriously .
Chicken Philosophy
WHY DID THE CHICKEN CROSS THE ROAD ???
Plato :
For the greater good .
Aristotle : To fulfill its nature on the other side .
Karl Marx :
It was a historical inevitability .
Machiavelli :
So that its subjects will view it with admiration , as a chicken which has the daring and courage to boldly cross the road , but also with fear , for whom among them has the strength to contend with such a paragon of avian virtue ?
In such a manner is the princely chicken 's dominion maintained .
Hippocrates : Because of an excess of light pink gooey stuff in its pancreas .
Jacques Derrida :
Any number of contending discourses may be discovered within the act of the chicken crossing the road , and each interpretation is equally valid as the authorial intent can never be discerned , because structuralism is DEAD , DAMMIT , DEAD !
Thomas de Torquemada :
Give me ten minutes with the chicken and I 'll find out .
Timothy Leary : Because that 's the only kind of trip the Establishment would let it take .
Douglas Adams : Forty - two .
Nietzsche : Because if you gaze too long across the Road , the Road gazes also across you .
Oliver North : National Security was at stake .
B.F. Skinner : Because the external influences which had pervaded its sensorium from birth had caused it to develop in such a fashion that it would tend to cross roads , even while believing these actions to be of its own free will .
Carl Jung :
The confluence of events in the cultural gestalt necessitated that individual chickens cross roads at this historical juncture , and therefore synchronicitously brought such occurrences into being .
Jean - Paul Sartre :
In order to act in good faith and be true to itself , the chicken found it necessary to cross the road .
Ludwig Wittgenstein :
The possibility of " crossing " was encoded into the objects " chicken " and " road " , and circumstances came into being which caused the actualization of this potential occurrence .
Albert Einstein :
Whether the chicken crossed the road or the road crossed the chicken depends upon your frame of reference .
Aristotle : To actualize its potential .
Buddha :
If you ask this question , you deny your own chicken - nature .
Howard Cosell :
It may very well have been one of the most astonishing events to grace the annals of history .
An historic , unprecedented avian biped with the temerity to attempt such an herculean achievement formerly relegated to homo sapien pedestrians is truly a remarkable occurence .
Salvador Dali : The Fish .
Darwin :
It was the logical next step after coming down from the trees .
Emily Dickinson : Because it could not stop for death .
Epicurus : For fun .
Ralph Waldo Emerson :
It did n't cross the road ; it transcended it .
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe :
The eternal hen - principle made it do it .
Ernest Hemingway : To die .
In the rain .
Werner Heisenberg :
We are not sure which side of the road the chicken was on , but it was moving very fast .
David Hume :
Out of custom and habit .
Saddam Hussein :
This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it .
Jack Nicholson : ' Cause it ( censored ) wanted to .
That 's the ( censored ) reason .
Pyrrho the Skeptic :
What road ?
Ronald Reagan : Well , ...................
John Sununu :
The Air Force was only too happy to provide the transportation , so quite understandably the chicken availed himself of the opportunity .
The Sphinx : You tell me .
Henry David Thoreau :
To live deliberately ... and suck all the marrow out of life .
Mark Twain :
The news of its crossing has been greatly exaggerated .
Mishima :
For the beauty of it .
The chicken 's extension of its sinuous legs sent shivers of a dark despair into the souls not only of the silently watching hens but also the roosters , who felt a sudden sexual desire for their exquisite comrade .
The dark courage of the chicken was as beautiful as drops of dew upon jade at midnight , struck by a partial moon , its light filtered through clouds .
One of the deeply aroused roosters could stand the intensity of the moment no more and bit off the head of the beautiful , courageous chicken - hero , whose wine blood was deliciously drunken by the road , and he died .
Johnny Cochran :
The chicken did n't cross the road .
Some chicken - hating , genocidal , lying public official moved the road right under the chicken 's feet while he was practicing his golf swing and thinking about his family .
Camus :
The chicken 's mother had just died .
But this did not really upset him , as any number of witnesses can attest .
In fact , he crossed just because the sun got in his eyes .
John Sununu ( again ) : I would argue that the chicken never crossed the road at all .
That it is a story concocted by the Clinton Administration to distract attention from their failed agriculture policy .
Where is the evidence that the chicken crossed the road ?
Where , Michael ?
Michael Kinsley : Oh , John , come on !
Everybody knows the chicken crossed the road .
What evidence do you need ?
It 's obvious that the chicken crossed the road .
Your whole argument is just a smoke and mirror tactic to distract us from the fact that most chickens polled now back the Democratic Party .
You ought to be ashamed of yourself , John .
Siskel : I do n't know why it crossed the road , but I loved it .
Thumbs up !
Ebert : I disagree .
The whole thing left the audience wondering ; the chicken 's crossing the road was never clearly explained and the chicken did n't emote very well .
It could n't even speak English !
Thumbs down .
Michael Kinsley :
But you both agree it did cross the road , right ?
See , John .
I 'm right as usual .

Since its humble beginnings as a single cell , life has evolved into a spectacular array of shapes and sizes , from tiny fleas to towering Tyrannosaurus rex , from slow - soaring vultures to fast - swimming swordfish , and from modest ferns to alluring orchids .
But just how such diversity of form could arise out of evolution ’s mess of random genetic mutations — how a functional wing could sprout where none had grown before , or how flowers could blossom in what had been a flowerless world — has remained one of the most fascinating and intractable questions in evolutionary biology .
Now finally , after more than a century of puzzling , scientists are finding answers coming fast and furious and from a surprising quarter , the field known as evo-devo .
Just coming into its own as a science , evo-devo is the combined study of evolution and development , the process by which a nubbin of a fertilized egg transforms into a full - fledged adult .
And what these scientists are finding is that development , a process that has for more than half a century been largely ignored in the study of evolution , appears to have been one of the major forces shaping the history of life on earth .
For starters , evo-devo researchers are finding that the evolution of complex new forms , rather than requiring many new mutations or many new genes as had long been thought , can instead be accomplished by a much simpler process requiring no more than tweaks to already existing genes and developmental plans .
Stranger still , researchers are finding that the genes that can be tweaked to create new shapes and body parts are surprisingly few .
The same DNA sequences are turning out to be the spark inciting one evolutionary flowering after another .
“ Do these discoveries blow people ’s minds ?
Yes , ” said Dr. Sean B. Carroll , biologist at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at the University of Wisconsin , Madison .
“ The first response is ‘ Huh ? ’ and the second response is ‘ Far out . ’ ”
“ This is the illumination of the utterly dark , ” Dr. Carroll added .
The development of an organism — how one end gets designated as the head or the tail , how feet are enticed to grow at the end of a leg rather than at the wrist — is controlled by a hierarchy of genes , with master genes at the top controlling a next tier of genes , controlling a next and so on .
But the real interest for evolutionary biologists is that these hierarchies not only favor the evolution of certain forms but also disallow the growth of others , determining what can and cannot arise not only in the course of the growth of an embryo , but also over the history of life itself .
Bill Gates has often said that over time , the cost of computer hardware approaches zero .
Here 's one such example :
Ten years out , in terms of actual hardware costs you can almost think of hardware as being free .
History has proven him right .
Computer hardware is n't literally free , of course .
But it 's effectively free relative to the level of computing power you 're getting for your dollar .
What does it mean when computer hardware is effectively free , and getting even more free every day ?
For one thing , computer software starts to look incredibly expensive .
But let 's put aside the ratio of software cost to hardware cost for now .
If you 're Google , or any other company building out massive datacenter farms , cheap hardware is a strategic advantage .
It means you can build larger and larger datacenters for less money .
Computers may be smaller and cheaper than ever , but they still require electricity to operate .
You now have a new problem .
The electrical power used to drive all that free hardware you 've amassed becomes your greatest expense :
Over the last three generations of Google 's computing infrastructure , performance has nearly doubled , Barroso said .
But because performance per watt remained nearly unchanged , that means electricity consumption has also almost doubled .
If server power consumption grows 20 percent per year , the four - year cost of a server 's electricity bill will be larger than the $ 3,000 initial price of a typical low - end server with x86 processors .
Google 's data center is populated chiefly with such machines .
But if power consumption grows at 50 percent per year , " power costs by the end of the decade would dwarf server prices , " even without power increasing beyond its current 9 cents per kilowatt - hour cost , Barroso said .
Computer hardware costs may be approaching zero , but power costs are fixed – or rising .
The thirst for power in the face of increasingly large datacenters has driven Google to build datacenters in out - of - the - way places where power costs are low :
Google , for example , has watched its energy consumption almost double during the past three generations of upgrades to its sprawling computing infrastructure .
It recently unveiled a major new datacenter site in a remote part of Oregon , where power costs are a fraction of those at Google 's home base in Silicon Valley .
But cheap power may not be enough .
Last year , Google engineer Luiz Andr Barroso predicted that energy costs would dwarf equipment costs – " possibly by a large margin " – if power - hungry datacenters did n't mend their ways .
Barroso went on to warn that datacenters ' growing appetite for power " could have serious consequences for the overall affordability of computing , not to mention the overall health of the planet . "
Google does n't just build their own servers .
They build their own power supplies , too :
The power supply to servers is one place that energy is unnecessarily lost .
One - third of the electricity running through a typical power supply leaks out as heat , [ Urs Hlzle ] said .
That 's a waste of energy and also creates additional costs in the cooling necessary because of the heat added to a building .
Rather than waste the electricity and incur the additional costs for cooling , Google has power supplies specially made that are 90 % efficient .
" It 's not hard to do .
That 's why to me it 's personally offensive " that standard power supplies are n't as efficient , he said .
While he admits that ordering specially made power supplies is more expensive than buying standard products , Google still saves money ultimately by conserving energy and cooling , he said .
Google wants to extend that same efficiency outside their datacenter to your home PC .
The three page Google whitepaper High - efficiency power supplies for home computers and servers ( pdf ) outlines how and why :
At Google , we run many computers in our data centers to serve your queries , so energy conservation and efficiency are important to us .
For several years we 've been developing more efficient power supplies to eliminate waste from power supplies .
Instead of the typical efficiencies of 60 - 70 % , our servers ' power supplies now run at 90 % efficiency or better , cutting down the energy losses by a factor of four .
We believe this energy - saving power supply technology can be applied to home
computers , too .
So we 've been working with Intel and other partners to propose a new power supply standard .
The opportunity for savings is immense – we estimate that if deployed in 100 million PCs running for an average of eight hours per day , this new standard would save 40 billion kilowatt - hours over three years , or more than $ 5 billion at California 's energy rates .
I can vouch for this : power is incredibly expensive in California , to the point that running even a single PC 24/7 can have a noticeable impact on your power bill .
Google 's proposal to increase the efficiency of PC power supplies mirrors a push for efficiency that 's been going on for a while in the PC enthusiast space .
It 's partly a reflection of the quiet PC movement : less heat always equal less noise .
But it can also have a bottom - line impact on how much you pay the power company each month .
I 'm not aware of any standard PC power supplies that reach the lofty 90 % efficiency goal Google claims .
What Google 's proposing is a deeper , more fundamental change to the way the PC power supply is built – simplifying from multiple voltages ( +12 v , - 12 v , 5 v , and 3.3v ) to a single voltage ( 12v ) .
But a standard PC power supply of sufficient quality can reach up to 85 % efficiency .
Consider the following graph comparing the efficiency of two PC power supplies :
The graph shows the difference between a typical PC power supply and one of the most energy efficient power supplies currently on the market .
The data table tells the story in raw watts :
NeoPower 480 Power Supply AC Input 110 142 220 276 336 390 515 596 DC
Output 65 90 150 200 250 300 400 460 Efficiency 59 % 63 % 68 % 72 % 74 % 77 % 78 % 77 % Waste 45 52 70 76 86 90 115 136
Corsair HX520W Power Supply AC Input 64 88 115 183 236 295 350 486 638 DC
Output 43 63 89 148 199 251 298 407 519 Efficiency 68 % 72 % 77 % 81 % 84 % 85 % 85 % 84 % 81 % Waste 21 24 26 35 37 44 52 79 119
It 's a decent result ; efficiency increases by more than 10 percent across the board .
But there 's a catch : the power supply efficiency curve peaks at around 250 watts .
Most desktop PCs barely use 200 watts of power .
It 's extremely difficult to build a desktop computer that uses 250 watts of power without adding a high - powered $ 300 + gaming class video card to the mix – or even two of them in SLI mode .
Furthermore , you 'll only reach that level of power usage under extreme load – with the video card and CPU both operating at near 100 % usage .
In other words , only when you 're playing a video game .
The difference between idle and gaming load power usage can be more than 100w .
Unless you 're a gamer , you wo n't even come close to 200 watts of power usage , even under full load .
And how often is your PC operating at full load ?
If you 're like most users , almost never .
Your PC is statistically idle 99 % of the time it is turned on .
Idle power consumption for a typical desktop PC ranges between 120 and 150 watts .
Thus , the real challenge is to deliver 90 % + efficiency at typical idle power consumption levels – 120 - 150 watts .
The savings from upgrading to an efficient power supply on a single PC are rarely worth it .
I 'll demonstrate using my old server as an example .
It draws 160 watts of power at idle , and is turned on 24/7 , 365 days a year .
If I was to hypothetically install a power supply in this server that was 15 percent more efficient – a best - case scenario – how much power would I save per year ?
160 watts * ( 8,760 hours per year ) / 1000 = 1401.6 kilowatt - hours 136 watts * ( 8,760 hours per year ) / 1000 = 1191.4 kilowatt - hours
At the insanely expensive California power rates in my area , that equates to the following dollar amount per year :
1401.6 kilowatt - hours * 14.28 cents / 100 = $ 200.15 1191.4 kilowatt - hours * 14.28 cents / 100 = $ 170.13
I 'd save a whopping thirty bucks per year .
That 's not even enough to cover the cost of the energy - efficient power supply !
I 'd have to amortize the cost of the power supply over three years to justify the expense .
All this tells us is that Google 's problems are n't necessarily our personal problems .
Not exactly news .
But if you multiply that result by the tens of thousands of servers in Google 's server farm , all operating at near 100 % load , it 's a whole different ballgame .
Efficiency is a strategic business decision for Google .
Considering the millions upon millions of computers in the world , more efficient PC power supplies are also part of the greater public good .
Do no evil , indeed .
Information technology also plays a key role for CombinatoRx ( which is pronounced com - bin - a - TOR - ics , as in the mathematics field that deals with combinations ) .
The company relies on the latest robotic drug - screening technology and software to test several thousand pairs of medicines a day .
At its laboratory here , researchers and robots systematically pair about 2,000 generic drugs with one another , with 2 million different combinations possible .
Each is tested on human cells .
If a drug pair inhibits the cells ’ production of inflammatory proteins , for example , that might be reason to explore whether the combination might work against arthritis .
Mr. Borisy describes it as a “ dumb , brute - force , empirical approach ” that assumes current knowledge of disease is too limited to predict in advance what combinations might work .
The company does , though , give priority to testing pairs it believes have the best chance of working .

Eight of the company ’s randomly arranged marriages , including drugs for cancer , arthritis and diabetes , have moved into clinical trials — an unusually high number for a company that is only seven years old .
Other companies are taking more calculated approaches .
Orexigen , in creating its obesity drug Contrave , took a treatment used for drug and alcohol addiction and combined it with an antidepressant sometimes used to help people quit smoking .
Meanwhile , Celator is focusing on drugs that are already used together to treat cancer .
But while doctors now generally use the maximum tolerable dose of each drug , Celator says the ratio of the drugs is what matters more .
So the company is developing combination products meant to deliver optimal ratios of the drugs to tumors .
Besides being quicker or cheaper to develop than single new drugs , combinations might also be more effective .
Scientists have long known that the biochemical pathways involved in disease are complex , with numerous alternate routes .
Trying to interfere with disease by blocking a single point can be like trying to keep traffic from reaching downtown Manhattan by closing a single intersection .
Reverend Billy was arrested and detained last night while reciting the First Amendment in Union Square .
The police claimed his preaching it at this month 's Critical Mass constituted " Harassment of a Public Official " .
The NYPD has a history of some controversial arrests at the Critical Mass events , and at last night 's the number of police practically outnumbered the riders .
From the press release we received :
" ... even unaffiliated riders were ticketed as they approached the park .
Reverend Billy and his partner Savitri D were reciting the First Amendment to the United States Constitution to the gathered police force when Lieutenant Daniel Albano , head of the NYPD 's Legal Division , ordered the Reverend 's arrest and detention at the 13th Precinct station .
It is believed Albano is the public official Reverend Billy has been charged with harassing . "
This brings up ongoing concern over protecting civil liberties and rights to free assembly and political action .
However , it also draws attention to selectively enforced Parade Laws , drafted by the police and passed into law by the City Council earlier this year .
The law criminalizes gatherings of more than 50 people that do not have permits .
Something the press release points out is that " while the NYPD surrounded and intimidated last night 's Critical Mass cyclists , a line of several hundred shoppers formed just across the street to purchase the new iPhone , blocking pedestrian traffic and forcing people to walk in the street . "
As of now , Reverend Billy is being held at 100 Centre Street , awaiting arraignment .
Hopefully he 'll be out for tomorrow 's Hot and Holy Highline Revival show !

In practice the close because associated  principle is violated in all sorts of design works , beginning with an ordinary layout .
For example , a header is often placed so that its equally distant from the paragraphs above and below it .
Although a reader mostly has enough grey matter to figure out where the header belongs , you had better get him to pay attention to contents rather than let him have a hard time making sense of the form .
The header should always cling to the paragraph right under it .
The group says it wants to inform the public
The Terror - Free Oil Initiative ( TFO ) , which runs the outlet , says none of its fuel comes from countries which it believes are supporting terrorism .
It currently uses only petrol from the US and Canada , rejecting supplies from the Middle East and elsewhere .
The TFO admits this is difficult on a large scale but says using its petrol will send a message to the big oil companies that customers want change .
The outlet is decorated to drive home its message .
Along with the large Terror - Free signs , the pumps display a diagram of how the owners believe unscreened fuel funds the enemies of the US .
Perhaps most emotive is the TFO 's logo , which combines the twin towers , the Pentagon and the United 93 designation of the fourth 9/11 plane .
In a statement , the group 's spokesman Joe Kaufman , said : " We can not help but feel held hostage to the whims of those that , if they were n't accepting our money , would instead accept our demise .
" Because of this , and other reasons as well , our quest is to get away from Middle Eastern oil altogether . "
The station is reported to have had a quiet start , not helped by a nearby rival dropping its prices .
Greetings Blogland , I have made a quick and dirty one download installer for Qi for the Windows platform .
It installs CLISP under the Qi directory and adds a link for Qi in the start menu .
I 'm using NSIS to create the software so if anyone wants to make the installer better , let me know .
I 'll be adding the installer code to the SVN repository atthe google code page .
I 've also added a Featured Download on the right hand site to help people get to Qi quicker and easier .
This is an easy area that needs more work so if anyone feels like maintaining packages , create them and let me know .
I 'll keep the Windows package up to date but if anyone wants to take the Linux or OS X side , I 'd appreciate it .
Here is the direct download linkbut you can easily see it atHopefully this will help spread Qi to new and interesting places .
Let me know if you have any problems with the installer , please let me know .
Until Later ...
Robert has already discussed this on his own site but since there was some discussion of these figures , I thought it useful to post them so that the more general audience could see them .
So all I want to do is insert the relevant states of the various plots that we usually put up at frequent intervals .
( Though I will also pause to point that the curve is now turning up , as Robert predicted it would on Tuesday ) .
Perhaps the most relevant ( in regard to us not worrying ) is the state of the crude stocks , since with those available , then we can produce more gasoline as it now becomes more in demand .
It may not , however , turn around fast enough to avoid an all - time high in gas prices .
This is more for the historic record than much else , although it is true that every picture tells a story , and with the impact evident in the gas prices , here is the current state of the gasoline stocks in the US , according to the EIA Wednesday .
The timing of the curve should capture the measure of this season ’s drop in volume .
Demand itself has been up measurably over this time last year , but is now falling back to the same level of demand .
Whether this will continue , as the driving season comes upon us will be a function of gas prices and the general state of the economy – about which I am not going to comment , except to say that there is no talk around our office about any impact from the current rise in prices .
Domestic production of gasoline has been running significantly above last year , but is now returning to those levels
While imports have been well below last year , although climbing at the same rate as they did about this time last year .
As far as the refineries go , they are processing about the same amount of crude as they did this time last year
But while imports have been about the same as last year
The amount that comes from domestic production , while it has been stable for almost a year , is now starting to dip down again .
It is this downward dip in domestic production , when tied with the problems that Mexico ( typical of other South American countries ) is now seeing , and the other issues about production around the world , that suggest that this could end up being a little more volatile summer than some of the other commentators would have us believe .
I note , for example , that both Peter Jackson and Michael Lynch spoke at the Canadian Energy Research Institute Oil Conference last week in Calgary the natural gas one being in March .
Not having taken the time to drop by I am not quite sure how rosy they painted the picture , but it will be interesting to see how far off their predictions are this time , and what excuses will and will not be made .
One of the great things about LtU discussions is that we have some very witty posters , and some posts are LOL funny ( that 's " laugh out loud " for those new to the internet ... )
So I decided to start an informal poll here : which is the funniest post on LtU ever ?
I suggest two categories : one for general humour and wit , and a second for humour that requires knowledge of the theory of pogramming languages to decipher .
On edit : I think we need a special category for longer , more literary posts , if you will - the type Frank used to produce .
An Italian judge today ordered 26 Americans , almost all CIA agents , to stand trial on charges of kidnapping a terrorism suspect in 2003 and flying him to Egypt , where he says he was tortured .
The Milan judge set a trial date for June 8 .
Prosecutors allege that five Italian intelligence officials worked with the Americans to abduct Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr from a Milan street in February 2003 .
The Americans will almost certainly be tried in absentia .
Among those indicted was the former Italian chief of military intelligence , Nicolo Pollari .
Mr Pollari , the only defendant who appeared during the preliminary hearing , insisted that Italian intelligence played no role in the alleged abduction .
He told the judge he was unable to defend himself properly because documents clarifying his position had been excluded from the proceedings because they contain state secrets .
After his capture , Mr Nasr was allegedly transferred by vehicle to the Aviano air force base near Venice , then by air to the Ramstein air base in Germany , and then on to Egypt , where critics say he was tortured .
All but one of the American suspects have been identified as CIA agents , including the former station chiefs in Rome and Milan .
The other is a US Air Force officer stationed at the time at Aviano .
The European parliament this week approved a report accusing Britain , Germany , Italy and other EU countries of turning a blind eye to CIA flights carrying terrorist suspects in Europe .
In its report , the parliament 's committee on CIA activities in Europe said more than 1,200 CIA - operated flights had used European airspace between 2001 and 2005 .
It accused some European countries of turning a blind eye to the flights , a number of which were allegedly used to illegally transport terrorism suspects .
The US intelligence agency may also have operated secret jails for terrorism suspects at US military bases around Europe , according to the report .
Several member states were criticised for a " lack of cooperation " and the committee accused Britain , Austria , Italy , Poland and Portugal of showing an obstructive attitude .
Criticism of Britain for allegedly not cooperating with the parliamentary investigation was removed from the report at the insistence of Labour MEPs and the final wording was also softer on the German government .
But objections to testimony by the EU foreign policy chief , Javier Solana , remained , with the parliament accusing him of making " omissions " in his statement to the committee .
The Bush administration acknowledges the secret transfer of suspects to foreign countries , but denies torturing them or handing them to countries that did .
A Munich court last month issued arrest warrants for 13 suspected CIA agents accused of kidnapping Khaled el - Masri , a German national of Lebanese descent .
Mr Masri , who spent five months in an Afghan jail where he said he was tortured , wants to sue the CIA .
Last year , the German parliament set up a special committee to investigate the alleged " renditions " of Mr Masri and of Murat Kurnaz , a German - born Turk .
Mr Kurnaz spent nearly five years in Guantánamo Bay where he said he was tortured and abused .

Australians in the last decade have embraced coffee in all its forms , but they ’ve saved the most expensive -- and excremental -- for last .

Kopi Luwak , made in neighboring Indonesia from coffee beans excreted by native civet cats , is reputedly the world ’s rarest and most expensive coffee , painstakingly extracted by hand from the animals ’ forest droppings .
When roasted , the resulting beans sell for around $ 1,000 a kilogram ( $ 450 a pound ) and brew into a earthy , syrupy , coffee acknowledged by connoisseurs as one of the world ’s finest .
Despite the closeness of the coffee ’s home on the islands of Sumatra , Java and Sulawesi , Australia ’s first civet cat brew has only just gone on sale in Queensland state , selling for A$ 50 a cup at the Heritage Tea Rooms , west of Townsville .
“ Everyone calls it cat poo coffee , ” cafe owner Michelle Sharpe told the Australian Associated Press .
“ People who willingly pay the $ 50 are uplifted by the thrill of the experience , ” her husband Allan Sharpe said .
Civet cats , considered a delicacy in China , are linked to the SARS respiratory virus that emerged in the south of that country in 2002 and spread globally .
Kopi Luwak joins a booming coffee scene in Australia , which has seen consumption grow from 300 grams per person in 1939 , to 2.4 kilograms a head , or 1.26 billion cups a year worth A$ 3 billion ( $ 2.5 billion ) in sales .
Around a dozen people a month try out the exotic brew , with reactions so far 99 per cent favorable .
“ It ’s as good as my private life is bad .
This is the kind of coffee you renounce your religion and sell your child for , ” one taster quoted by AAP said .

October 2005
The first Summer Founders Program has just finished .
We were surprised how well it went .
Overall only about 10 % of startups succeed , but if I had to guess now , I 'd predict three or four of the eight startups we funded will make it .
Of the startups that needed further funding , I believe all have either closed a round or are likely to soon .
Two have already turned down ( lowball ) acquisition offers .
We would have been happy if just one of the eight seemed promising by the end of the summer .
What 's going on ?
Did some kind of anomaly make this summer 's applicants especially good ?
We worry about that , but we can't think of one .
We 'll find out this winter .
The whole summer was full of surprises .
The best was that the hypothesis we were testing seems to be correct .
Young hackers can start viable companies .
This is good news for two reasons : ( a ) it 's an encouraging thought , and ( b ) it means that Y Combinator , which is predicated on the idea , is not hosed .
Age
More precisely , the hypothesis was that success in a startup depends mainly on how smart and energetic you are , and much less on how old you are or how much business experience you have .
The results so far bear this out .
The 2005 summer founders ranged in age from 18 to 28 ( average 23 ) , and there is no correlation between their ages and how well they 're doing .
This should not really be surprising .
Bill Gates and Michael Dell were both 19 when they started the companies that made them famous .
Young founders are not a new phenomenon : the trend began as soon as computers got cheap enough for college kids to afford them .
Another of our hypotheses was that you can start a startup on less money than most people think .
Other investors were surprised to hear the most we gave any group was $ 20,000 .
But we knew it was possible to start on that little because we started Viaweb on $ 10,000 .
And so it proved this summer .
Three months ' funding is enough to get into second gear .
We had a demo day for potential investors ten weeks in , and seven of the eight groups had a prototype ready by that time .
One , Reddit , had already launched , and were able to give a demo of their live site .
A researcher who studied the SFP startups said the one thing they had in common was that they all worked ridiculously hard .
People this age are commonly seen as lazy .
I think in some cases it 's not so much that they lack the appetite for work , but that the work they 're offered is unappetizing .
The experience of the SFP suggests that if you let motivated people do real work , they work hard , whatever their age .
As one of the founders said " I 'd read that starting a startup consumed your life , but I had no idea what that meant until I did it . "
I 'd feel guilty if I were a boss making people work this hard .
But we 're not these people 's bosses .
They 're working on their own projects .
And what makes them work is not us but their competitors .
Like good athletes , they do n't work hard because the coach yells at them , but because they want to win .
We have less power than bosses , and yet the founders work harder than employees .
It seems like a win for everyone .
The only catch is that we get on average only about 5 - 7 % of the upside , while an employer gets nearly all of it .
( We 're counting on it being 5 - 7 % of a much larger number . )
As well as working hard , the groups all turned out to be extraordinarily responsible .
I can't think of a time when one failed to do something they 'd promised to , even by being late for an appointment .
This is another lesson the world has yet to learn .
One of the founders discovered that the hardest part of arranging a meeting with executives at a big cell phone carrier was getting a rental company to rent him a car , because he was too young .
I think the problem here is much the same as with the apparent laziness of people this age .
They seem lazy because the work they 're given is pointless , and they act irresponsible because they 're not given any power .
Some of them , anyway .
We only have a sample size of about twenty , but it seems so far that if you let people in their early twenties be their own bosses , they rise to the occasion .
Morale
The summer founders were as a rule very idealistic .
They also wanted very much to get rich .
These qualities might seem incompatible , but they 're not .
These guys want to get rich , but they want to do it by changing the world .
They would n't ( well , seven of the eight groups would n't ) be interested in making money by speculating in stocks .
They want to make something people use .
I think this makes them more effective as founders .
As hard as people will work for money , they 'll work harder for a cause .
And since success in a startup depends so much on motivation , the paradoxical result is that the people likely to make the most money are those who are n't in it just for the money .
The founders of Kiko , for example , are working on an Ajax calendar .
They want to get rich , but they pay more attention to design than they would if that were their only motivation .
You can tell just by looking at it .
I never considered it till this summer , but this might be another reason startups run by hackers tend to do better than those run by MBAs .
Perhaps it 's not just that hackers understand technology better , but that they 're driven by more powerful motivations .
Microsoft , as I 've said before , is a dangerously misleading example .
Their mean corporate culture only works for monopolies .
Google is a better model .
Considering that the summer founders are the sharks in this ocean , we were surprised how frightened most of them were of competitors .
But now that I think of it , we were just as frightened when we started Viaweb .
For the first year , our initial reaction to news of a competitor was always : we 're doomed .
Just as a hypochondriac magnifies his symptoms till he 's convinced he has some terrible disease , when you 're not used to competitors you magnify them into monsters .
Here 's a handy rule for startups : competitors are rarely as dangerous as they seem .
Most will self - destruct before you can destroy them .
And it certainly does n't matter how many of them there are , any more than it matters to the winner of a marathon how many runners are behind him .
" It 's a crowded market , " I remember one founder saying worriedly .
" Are you the current leader ? " I asked .
" Yes . "
" Is anyone able to develop software faster than you ? "
" Probably not . "
" Well , if you 're ahead now , and you 're the fastest , then you 'll stay ahead .
What difference does it make how many others there are ? "
Another group was worried when they realized they had to rewrite their software from scratch .
I told them it would be a bad sign if they did n't .
The main function of your initial version is to be rewritten .
That 's why we advise groups to ignore issues like scalability , internationalization , and heavy - duty security at first . [ 1 ]
I can imagine an advocate of " best practices " saying these ought to be considered from the start .
And he'd be right , except that they interfere with the primary function of software in a startup : to be a vehicle for experimenting with its own design .
Having to retrofit internationalization or scalability is a pain , certainly .
The only bigger pain is not needing to , because your initial version was too big and rigid to evolve into something users wanted .
I suspect this is another reason startups beat big companies .
Startups can be irresponsible and release version 1s that are light enough to evolve .
In big companies , all the pressure is in the direction of over - engineering .
What Got Learned
One thing we were curious about this summer was where these groups would need help .
That turned out to vary a lot .
Some we helped with technical advice -- for example , about how to set up an application to run on multiple servers .
Most we helped with strategy questions , like what to patent , and what to charge for and what to give away .
Nearly all wanted advice about dealing with future investors : how much money should they take and what kind of terms should they expect ?
However , all the groups quickly learned how to deal with stuff like patents and investors .
These problems are n't intrinsically difficult , just unfamiliar .
It was surprising -- slightly frightening even -- how fast they learned .
The weekend before the demo day for investors , we had a practice session where all the groups gave their presentations .
They were all terrible .
We tried to explain how to make them better , but we did n't have much hope .
So on demo day I told the assembled angels and VCs that these guys were hackers , not MBAs , and so while their software was good , we should not expect slick presentations from them .
The groups then proceeded to give fabulously slick presentations .
Gone were the mumbling recitations of lists of features .
It was as if they 'd spent the past week at acting school .
I still do n't know how they did it .
Perhaps watching each others ' presentations helped them see what they 'd been doing wrong .
Just as happens in college , the summer founders learned a lot from one another -- maybe more than they learned from us .
A lot of the problems they face are the same , from dealing with investors to hacking Javascript .
I do n't want to give the impression there were no problems this summer .
A lot went wrong , as usually happens with startups .
One group got an " exploding term - sheet " from some VCs .
Pretty much all the groups who had dealings with big companies found that big companies do everything infinitely slowly .
( This is to be expected .
If big companies were n't incapable , there would be no room for startups to exist . )
And of course there were the usual nightmares associated with servers .
In short , the disasters this summer were just the usual childhood diseases .
Some of this summer 's eight startups will probably die eventually ; it would be extraordinary if all eight succeeded .
But what kills them will not be dramatic , external threats , but a mundane , internal one : not getting enough done .
So far , though , the news is all good .
In fact , we were surprised how much fun the summer was for us .
The main reason was how much we liked the founders .
They 're so earnest and hard - working .
They seem to like us too .
And this illustrates another advantage of investing over hiring : our relationship with them is way better than it would be between a boss and an employee .
Y Combinator ends up being more like an older brother than a parent .
I was surprised how much time I spent making introductions .
Fortunately I discovered that when a startup needed to talk to someone , I could usually get to the right person by at most one hop .
I remember wondering , how did my friends get to be so eminent ?
and a second later realizing : shit , I 'm forty .
Another surprise was that the three - month batch format , which we were forced into by the constraints of the summer , turned out to be an advantage .
When we started Y Combinator , we planned to invest the way other venture firms do : as proposals came in , we 'd evaluate them and decide yes or no .
The SFP was just an experiment to get things started .
But it worked so well that we plan to do all our investing this way , one cycle in the summer and one in winter .
It 's more efficient for us , and better for the startups too .
Several groups said our weekly dinners saved them from a common problem afflicting startups : working so hard that one has no social life .
( I remember that part all too well . )
This way , they were guaranteed a social event at least once a week .
Independence
I 've heard Y Combinator described as an " incubator . "
Actually we 're the opposite : incubators exert more control than ordinary VCs , and we make a point of exerting less .
Among other things , incubators usually make you work in their office -- that 's where the word " incubator " comes from .
That seems the wrong model .
If investors get too involved , they smother one of the most powerful forces in a startup : the feeling that it 's your own company .
Incubators were conspicuous failures during the Bubble .
There 's still debate about whether this was because of the Bubble , or because they 're a bad idea .
My vote is they 're a bad idea .
I think they fail because they select for the wrong people .
When we were starting a startup , we would never have taken funding from an " incubator . "
We can find office space , thanks ; just give us the money .
And people with that attitude are the ones likely to succeed in startups .
Indeed , one quality all the founders shared this summer was a spirit of independence .
I 've been wondering about that .
Are some people just a lot more independent than others , or would everyone be this way if they were allowed to ?
As with most nature / nurture questions , the answer is probably : some of each .
But my main conclusion from the summer is that there 's more environment in the mix than most people realize .
I could see that from how the founders ' attitudes changed during the summer .
Most were emerging from twenty or so years of being told what to do .
They seemed a little surprised at having total freedom .
But they grew into it really quickly ; some of these guys now seem about four inches taller ( metaphorically ) than they did at the beginning of the summer .
When we asked the summer founders what surprised them most about starting a company , one said " the most shocking thing is that it worked . "
It will take more experience to know for sure , but my guess is that a lot of hackers could do this -- that if you put people in a position of independence , they develop the qualities they need .
Throw them off a cliff , and most will find on the way down that they have wings .
The reason this is news to anyone is that the same forces work in the other direction too .
Most hackers are employees , and this molds you into someone to whom starting a startup seems impossible as surely as starting a startup molds you into someone who can handle it .
If I 'm right , " hacker " will mean something different in twenty years than it does now .
Increasingly it will mean the people who run the company .
Y Combinator is just accelerating a process that would have happened anyway .
Power is shifting from the people who deal with money to the people who create technology , and if our experience this summer is any guide , this will be a good thing .

NEWS RELEASE
AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS
*************************
A calculation the size of Manhattan
Mathematicians solve E 8 structure which will lead to potential new discoveries in mathematics , physics and other fields
PALO ALTO , Calif . - March 19 , 2007 – The American Institute of Mathematics ( AIM ) , one of the leading math institutes in the U.S. , announced today that after four years of intensive collaboration , 18 top mathematicians and computer scientists from the U.S. and Europe have successfully mapped E 8 , one of the largest and most complicated structures in mathematics .
Partners on this project included MIT , Cornell University , University of Michigan , University of Utah and University of Maryland .
The findings will be unveiled today , Monday , March 19 at 2 p.m. Eastern , at a presentation by David Vogan , professor of mathematics at MIT and member of the team that mapped E 8 .
The presentation is open to the public and is taking place at MIT , Building 1 , Room 190 .
E 8 ( pronounced " E eight " ) is an example of a Lie ( pronounced " Lee " ) group .
Lie groups were invented by the 19th century Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie to study symmetry .
Underlying any symmetrical object , such as a sphere , is a Lie group .
Balls , cylinders or cones are familiar examples of symmetric three - dimensional objects .
Mathematicians study symmetries in higher dimensions .
In fact , E 8 is the symmetries of a geometric object like a sphere , cylinder or cone , but this object is 57 - dimensional .
E 8 is itself is 248 - dimensional .
[ Illustration above shows a 2 - dimensional projection of an 8 - dimensional depiction of E 8 's root system . ]
For details on E 8 , click here .
" E 8 was discovered over a century ago , in 1887 , and until now , no one thought the structure could ever be understood , " said Jeffrey Adams , project leader and mathematics professor at the University of Maryland .
" This groundbreaking achievement is significant both as an advance in basic knowledge , as well as a major advance in the use of large scale computing to solve complicated mathematical problems . "
The mapping of E 8 may well have unforeseen implications in mathematics and physics which wo n’t be evident for years to come .
" This is an exciting breakthrough , " said Peter Sarnak , Eugene Higgins Professor of Mathematics at Princeton University and chair of AIM 's scientific board .
" Understanding and classifying the representations of E8 and Lie groups has been critical to understanding phenomena in many different areas of mathematics and science including algebra , geometry , number theory , physics and chemistry .
This project will be invaluable for future mathematicians and scientists . "
The magnitude and nature of the E 8 calculation invite comparison with the Human Genome Project .
The human genome , which contains all the genetic information of a cell , is less than a gigabyte in size .
The result of the E 8 calculation , which contains all the information about E 8 and its representations , is 60 gigabytes in size .
This is enough to store 45 days of continuous music in MP3 - format .
If written out on paper , the answer would cover an area the size of Manhattan .
The computation required sophisticated new mathematical techniques and computing power not available even a few years ago .
While many scientific projects involve processing large amounts of data , the E 8 calculation is very different , as the size of the input is comparatively small , but the answer itself is enormous , and very dense .
" This is an impressive achievement , " said Hermann Nicolai , Director of the Albert Einstein Institute in Potsdam , Germany .
" While mathematicians have known for a long time about the beauty and the uniqueness of E 8 , we physicists have come to appreciate its exceptional role only more recently .
Understanding the inner workings of E 8 is not only a great advance for pure mathematics , but may also help physicists in their quest for a unified theory . "
According to Brian Conrey , executive director of the American Institute of Mathematics : " The E 8 calculation is notable for both its magnitude as well as the way it was achieved .
The mapping of E 8 breaks the ' mold ' of mathematicians typically known for their solitary style .
People will look back on this project as a significant landmark and because of this breakthrough , mathematics will now be viewed as a team sport . "
The Atlas of Lie Groups Project
The E 8 calculation is part of an ambitious project sponsored by AIM and the National Science Foundation , known as the Atlas of Lie Groups and Representations .
The goal of the Atlas project is to determine the unitary representations of all the Lie groups ( E 8 is the largest of the exceptional Lie groups ) .
This is one of the most important unsolved problems of mathematics .
The E 8 calculation is a major step , and suggest that the Atlas team is well on the way to solving this problem .
The Atlas team consists of 18 researchers from around the globe .
The core group consists of Jeffrey Adams ( University of Maryland ) , Dan Barbasch ( Cornell ) , John Stembridge ( University of Michigan ) , Peter Trapa ( University of Utah ) , Marc van Leeuwen ( Poitiers ) , David Vogan ( MIT ) , and ( until his death in 2006 ) Fokko du Cloux ( Lyon ) .
The Atlas project is funded by the National Science Foundation through the American Institute of Mathematics .
About American Institute of Mathematics
The American Institute of Mathematics , a nonprofit organization , was founded in 1994 by Silicon Valley businessmen John Fry and Steve Sorenson , longtime supporters of mathematical research .
AIM is one of the seven mathematical institutes in the U.S. funded by the National Science Foundation , an independent federal agency that supports mathematics , computer and social sciences .
The goals of AIM are to expand the frontiers of mathematical knowledge through focused research projects , by sponsoring conferences , and helping to develop the leaders of tomorrow .
In addition , AIM is interested in helping preserve the history of mathematics through the acquisition and preservation of rare mathematical books and documents and in making these materials available to scholars of mathematical history .

“ If you want others to be happy , practice compassion .
If you want to be happy , practice compassion . ” – Dalai Lama
By Leo Babauta
I believe compassion to be one of the few things we can practice that will bring immediate and long - term happiness to our lives .
I ’m not talking about the short - term gratification of pleasures like sex , drugs or gambling ( though I ’m not knocking them ) , but something that will bring true and lasting happiness .
The kind that sticks .
The key to developing compassion in your life is to make it a daily practice .
Meditate upon it in the morning ( you can do it while checking email ) , think about it when you interact with others , and reflect on it at night .
In this way , it becomes a part of your life .
Or as the Dalai Lama also said , “ This is my simple religion .
There is no need for temples ; no need for complicated philosophy .
Our own brain , our own heart is our temple ; the philosophy is kindness . ”
Definition
Let ’s use the Wikipedia definition of Compassion :
Compassion is an emotion that is a sense of shared suffering , most often combined with a desire to alleviate or reduce the suffering of another ; to show special kindness to those who suffer .
Compassion essentially arises through empathy , and is often characterized through actions , wherein a person acting with compassion will seek to aid those they feel compassionate for .
Compassionate acts are generally considered those which take into account the suffering of others and attempt to alleviate that suffering as if it were one ’s own .
In this sense , the various forms of the Golden Rule are clearly based on the concept of compassion .
Compassion differs from other forms of helpful or humane behavior in that its focus is primarily on the alleviation of suffering .
Benefits
Why develop compassion in your life ?
Well , there are scientific studies that suggest there are physical benefits to practicing compassion — people who practice it produce 100 percent more DHEA , which is a hormone that counteracts the aging process , and 23 percent less cortisol — the “ stress hormone . ”
But there are other benefits as well , and these are emotional and spiritual .
The main benefit is that it helps you to be more happy , and brings others around you to be more happy .
If we agree that it is a common aim of each of us to strive to be happy , then compassion is one of the main tools for achieving that happiness .
It is therefore of utmost importance that we cultivate compassion in our lives and practice compassion every day .
How do we do that ?
This guide contains 7 different practices that you can try out and perhaps incorporate into your every day life .
7 Compassion Practices
Morning ritual .
Greet each morning with a ritual .
Try this one , suggest by the Dalai Lama : “ Today I am fortunate to have woken up , I am alive , I have a precious human life , I am not going to waste it .
I am going to use all my energies to develop myself , to expand my heart out to others , to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings , I am going to have kind thoughts towards others , I am not going to get angry or think badly about others , I am going to benefit others as much as I can . ”
Then , when you ’ve done this , try one of the practices below .
Empathy Practice .
The first step in cultivating compassion is to develop empathy for your fellow human beings .
Many of us believe that we have empathy , and on some level nearly all of us do .
But many times we are centered on ourselves ( I ’m no exception ) and we let our sense of empathy get rusty .
Try this practice : Imagine that a loved one is suffering .
Something terrible has happened to him or her .
Now try to imagine the pain they are going through .
Imagine the suffering in as much detail as possible .
After doing this practice for a couple of weeks , you should try moving on to imagining the suffering of others you know , not just those who are close to you .
Commonalities practice .
Instead of recognizing the differences between yourself and others , try to recognize what you have in common .
At the root of it all , we are all human beings .
We need food , and shelter , and love .
We crave attention , and recognition , and affection , and above all , happiness .
Reflect on these commonalities you have with every other human being , and ignore the differences .
One of my favorite exercises comes from a great article from Ode Magazine — it ’s a five - step exercise to try when you meet friends and strangers .
Do it discreetly and try to do all the steps with the same person .
With your attention geared to the other person , tell yourself : Step 1 : “ Just like me , this person is seeking happiness in his / her life . ”
Step 2 : “ Just like me , this person is trying to avoid suffering in his / her life . ”
Step 3 : “ Just like me , this person has known sadness , loneliness and despair . ”
Step 4 : “ Just like me , this person is seeking to fill his / her needs . ”
Step 5 : “ Just like me , this person is learning about life . ”
Relief of suffering practice .
Once you can empathize with another person , and understand his humanity and suffering , the next step is to want that person to be free from suffering .
This is the heart of compassion — actually the definition of it .
Try this exercise : Imagine the suffering of a human being you ’ve met recently .
Now imagine that you are the one going through that suffering .
Reflect on how much you would like that suffering to end .
Reflect on how happy you would be if another human being desired your suffering to end , and acted upon it .
Open your heart to that human being and if you feel even a little that you ’d want their suffering to end , reflect on that feeling .
That ’s the feeling that you want to develop .
With constant practice , that feeling can be grown and nurtured .
Act of kindness practice .
Now that you ’ve gotten good at the 4th practice , take the exercise a step further .
Imagine again the suffering of someone you know or met recently .
Imagine again that you are that person , and are going through that suffering .
Now imagine that another human being would like your suffering to end — perhaps your mother or another loved one .
What would you like for that person to do to end your suffering ?
Now reverse roles : you are the person who desires for the other person ’s suffering to end .
Imagine that you do something to help ease the suffering , or end it completely .
Once you get good at this stage , practice doing something small each day to help end the suffering of others , even in a tiny way .
Even a smile , or a kind word , or doing an errand or chore , or just talking about a problem with another person .
Practice doing something kind to help ease the suffering of others .
When you are good at this , find a way to make it a daily practice , and eventually a throughout - the - day practice .
Those who mistreat us practice .
The final stage in these compassion practices is to not only want to ease the suffering of those we love and meet , but even those who mistreat us .
When we encounter someone who mistreats us , instead of acting in anger , withdraw .
Later , when you are calm and more detached , reflect on that person who mistreated you .
Try to imagine the background of that person .
Try to imagine what that person was taught as a child .
Try to imagine the day or week that person was going through , and what kind of bad things had happened to that person .
Try to imagine the mood and state of mind that person was in — the suffering that person must have been going through to mistreat you that way .
And understand that their action was not about you , but about what they were going through .
Now think some more about the suffering of that poor person , and see if you can imagine trying to stop the suffering of that person .
And then reflect that if you mistreated someone , and they acted with kindness and compassion toward you , whether that would make you less likely to mistreat that person the next time , and more likely to be kind to that person .
Once you have mastered this practice of reflection , try acting with compassion and understanding the next time a person treats you .
Do it in little doses , until you are good at it .
Practice makes perfect .
Evening routine .
I highly recommend that you take a few minutes before you go to bed to reflect upon your day .
Think about the people you met and talked to , and how you treated each other .
Think about your goal that you stated this morning , to act with compassion towards others .
How well did you do ?
What could you do better ?
What did you learn from your experiences today ?
And if you have time , try one of the above practices and exercises .
These compassionate practices can be done anywhere , any time .
At work , at home , on the road , while traveling , while at a store , while at the home of a friend or family member .
By sandwiching your day with a morning and evening ritual , you can frame your day properly , in an attitude of trying to practice compassion and develop it within yourself .
And with practice , you can begin to do it throughout the day , and throughout your lifetime .
This , above all , with bring happiness to your life and to those around you .
Linux Web Hosting
Linux is a Unix - like computer operating system assembled under the model of free and open source software development and distribution .
In fact , derived from UNIX .
The defining component of any Linux system is the Linux kernel , an operating system kernel first released October 5 , 1991 , by Linus Torvalds .
Linux system distributions may vary in many details of system operation , configuration , and software package selection .
Linux hosting and the system , in general , grew more popular .
Today , developers and hosting providers equipped with all the tools needed to make this platform just about as easy to use as the user - friendly Windows system .
On the other hand , if you have the know - how , you can get the most out of Linux by controlling your site via Shell 's command line interface .
Cost Efficient : .
In most cases , Linux hosting is notably less expensive than solutions designed on the Microsoft Windows platform .
Under the GNU GPL ( General Public License ) , it is an open - source software application freely distributed .
Although not all versions are free , distributions such as CentOS , Debian , and OpenSUSE are , thus making Linux hosting a solution that is the most affordable on the market .
Hence , preferred by individuals and SME's ( small and medium - sized business ) .

Hence , preferred by individuals and SME's ( small and medium - sized business ) .
Reliable , Robust and Stable : Linux hosting provides security , stability , and reliability .
With proper hardware , it can run for an extended period without needing to be rebooted for maintenance or technical issues .
Linux can harness the processing power of the computer on which installed , producing an unrivaled performance .

With proper hardware , it can run for an extended period without needing to be rebooted for maintenance or technical issues .
Linux can harness the processing power of the computer on which installed , producing an unrivaled performance .
Linux environment gets consistently improved , blocking appearing loopholes .
Get patched with new appearing security threats .
Linux hosting is highly functional , flexible and reconfigurable .
The functionality of Linux hosting attributed to the ability to make the most of the hardware , but its excellent compatibility plays a significant role as well .
It offers a greater range of support for programming languages than almost any other operating system .
Supports most of Programming languages and applications .
Some of the most common languages it supports are C , C++ , Python , Perl , and Ruby to name a few .
Compatible with widely SQL databases of the open - source variety , such as Postgre SQL and the industry - leading MySQL Server .
When combined , these powerful components allow users to create an operating system you have running on your personal computer ; you can still choose a Linux or UNIX hosting package and maintain your site directly from your web browser .
Services such as the Apache web server , the BIND name server , Send mail and Exim mail servers run smoothly on Linux
Difference with Windows Hosting
Support not available for Microsoft proprietary coding platforms like ASP .NET and Microsoft FrontPage extensions .
The Port numbers below 1024 can only use by the superuser ( root , under Unix ) and this prevents other users from running programs masquerading as regular services .
But , Under Win32 there is currently no real security beyond what you can provide us using file permissions and no superuser ( at least , not as far as port numbers are concerned ) .
Windows servers deploy scalable server applications using IIS is getting stronger as compared to Apache .
IIS enables developers to host a new generation of dynamic and engaging Web content , IIS fully supports , Microsoft Visual Basic programming system .
VBScript , Microsoft JScript , development software and JAVA components , it also supports Common Gateway Interface ( CGI ) and WinCGI for web - based programs , and Internet Server Application Programming Interface ( ISAPI ) extensions and filters .
Process isolation allows hosting multiple Web sites safely .
If a site stops responding , other sites will not be affected .
Microsoft Visual Basic gives you a complete Windows application development system in one package .
Visual Basic lets you write , edit , and test Windows applications .
Besides , Visual Basic includes tools you can use to write and compile help files , ActiveX controls , and even Internet applications .
The hosting companies which provide Linux hosting are CPWebHosting , WebHostingCheap.net , WebHostingSmarts.com , usa-webhosts.com , etc .
Linux is one of the major operating systems in use today , providing all the power and flexibility of a UNIX workstation as a complete set of Internet applications and a fully functional desktop interface .
Most of the companies sell their PC or Laptops with pre-installed versions of the UNIX or LINUX O.S. Dell Desktop , Laptop & Notebook series features Ubuntu .
Ubuntu is one of the most popular open sources , Linux based OS on the plant .
Internet Applications for Linux Hosting
Internet application is a web application that resembles a desktop application in many ways but is delivered by a browser , virtual machine or from a browser plug - in .
The list of Internet applications is quite long , I have here given the list of web browsers supported by Linux .
A worldwide community of developers
The worldwide community of developers who contribute to the source code , security fixes , and system enhancements always provide support to the Linux .
Forums and distributed community offer free support and user peace of mind .
There 's no single source and single point of failure for Linux support or development .
Linux Foundation : Linux has one additional advantage that it has The Linux Foundation which is a corporate collection of platinum supporters ( Fujitsu , Hitachi , HP , IBM , Intel , NEC , Novell , and Oracle ) .
Considered as a positive sign for Linux users and adopters because its presence assures that Linux developed on the continuous basis .
This foundation also contains members who sponsor Linux Torvalds through donations and membership dues and others who work on Linux full time .
Behind this , their primary objective is to “ promote , provide safety and standardize Linux to encourage its growth around the world . ”
It is the largest source for all things Linux .
But this advantage is not possessed by the Windows .

TRUTH : This is incorrect .
The Constitution never once mentions a deity , because the Founding Fathers wanted to keep their new country " religion - neutral . "
Our Founding Fathers were an eclectic collection of Atheists , Deists , Christians , Freemasons and Agnostics .
George Washington , the Father of our country , and John Adams ( Second President of the USA ) CLEARLY stated in the 1796 Treaty of Tripoli : " The Government of the United States of America is not , in any sense , founded on the Christian Religion . ” G.W. rarely attended church and instead followed a popular 18th century philosophy called Deism — a Star Wars - esque philosophy that believed in a cosmic energy or big-ass universal " Force . "
The dictionary says that Deism is " a system of thought advocating natural religion based on human reason rather than revelation , " that had nothing to do with Christian principles .
James Madison , original mastermind of our Constitution , was an Atheist to the core who loved skewering Christianity .
In 1785 he wrote , " What have been [ Christianity ’s ] fruits ?
More or less in all places , pride and indolence in the Clergy , ignorance and servility in the laity ; in both , superstition , bigotry and persecution .
” Thomas Jefferson , who sat down and authored The Declaration of Independence , rarely missed an opportunity to laugh at Christianity .
In a letter to John Adams in 1823 , he wrote : " The day will come when the mystical generation of Jesus …will be classed with the fable of the generation of Minerva in the brain of Jupiter .
" More ammo : In 1814 , Tommy J. wrote about the Bible 's Old and New Testaments , " The whole history of these books is so defective and doubtful -- evidence that parts have proceeded from an extraordinary man ; and that other parts are of the fabric of very inferior minds .
” In fact , it was President Jefferson himself who first wrote ( to a Baptist church group in 1802 ) , " The First Amendment has erected a wall of separation between Church and State . "
Therefore , when Jefferson talked about “ Nature ’s God , ” the “ Creator ” and “ divine Providence ” in the Declaration that he wrote , he was being a hippie and referring to a general cosmic energy -- not the Christian God.
America is not a Christian nation .
Period .
Our Constitution derived from the post - Christian Enlightenment values of reason and truth ... never from the paranoid yammerings of that otherwise compassionate cult leader who fucking died in the Middle Eastern desert 3000 years ago .
MYTH 2 : US Conservatives tend to be patriotic , ethical Americans ; liberals tend to hate America and are immoral .
TRUTH : Liberals are n't the traitors to America .
In fact , conservatives who insist on sending American troops into the Iraqi slaughterhouse to watch some blood - n' - guts " towelhead " ass - kickin ' are the traitors .
Most of them could care less about our troops , no more than Mao or Stalin cared about the safety of their own soldiers .
In the neocons ' view , these young boys and girls are expendable test dummies .
They 're dying for virtually nothing , so that the hicks in the Bush Admin can make good on their campaign promises to their buddies from the petroleum and infrastructure - rebuilding industries .
By revving up the Arab threat , these MFs can scream " national security " and " freedom " as smokescreens , while getting their hands on a diminishing resource : Middle Eastern fossil fuels , which power everything from your lightbulbs and computer that you leave on all night , to your stupid gas - guzzler pickup truck .
Pro-war conservatives are the traitors to America .
With only 29 % of the public approving of Bush 's policies now , it took a full 5 years for America to finally wake up in bed next to this disgusting fact .
Do liberals hate America ?
No , in fact they care so much about the USA that they fight so aggressively to make it better .
They 're not anti-American ; they 're just anti-stupidity .
Do liberals hate American policies ?
Sometimes , but only the self - destructive ones that threaten human rights , liberty , democracy , justice , inquiry , excellence and reason -- the values that our country was founded upon .
As for conservative moral superiority ?
Frauds .
Think of the child - molesting priests , money - scamming televangelist preachers , Jack Abramoff 's friends in the Bush Admin , gay - hating Jesus lovers , the Christians who beat up the professor who opposed intelligent design , human rights violators like Lynndie England and her Abu Ghraib hick officer pals , Tommy " Scandal - icious " Delay , Scooter " Leaky " Libby , the entire K Street Project meant to hire only Republicans , FEMA 's Michael " Yer doin ' a heckuva job " Brownie , and so on .
Oh and by the way , conservative Red states have a divorce rate 27 % higher than the liberal Blue states , the per capita rate of violent crime in Red states is 49 per 100,000 higher than in Blue states , the top 5 states with the highest rates of alcohol abuse are Red states , and the per capita rate of gonorrhea in Red states was 41 per 100,000 higher than in the Blue states .
Time to unshelf the antibiotics for our " ethical , " " God- fearing " conservative friends with their " traditional family values .
"
MYTH 3 . The US has a liberal media .
TRUTH : This is a paranoid Republican myth .
Reality check : the US media is a mix of liberal , centrist and conservative voices .
Also , the US media is largely owned by 10 corporations who frequently push pro-conservative agendas to the American public .
Evidence : 1. Even Republican Pat Buchanan confessed , " For heaven sakes , we kid about the liberal media , but every Republican on earth does that . "
Neo -conservative pundit Bill Kristol also said , " I admit it : the liberal media were never that powerful , and the whole thing was often used as an excuse by conservatives for conservative failures .
" 2 . A 2005 study in the Quarterly Journal of Economics found that " coverage by public television and radio is conservative compared to the rest of the mainstream media . "
Why ?
Partly because only four major corporate networks control American TV news -- up to 75 % of the audience share .
The " Big 10 " media conglomerates who control the bulk of the entire US media are : AOL Time Warner , Disney , General Electric , News Corporation , Viacom , Vivendi , Sony , Bertelsmann , AT&T and Liberty Media .
Yes , we have National Public Radio , but compare its public reach to that of Canada 's CBC and the United Kingdom 's BBC.3 .
Eighty percent of all US newspapers are owned by corporate chains .
4 .
Liberals are virtually non-existent on talk radio stations nationwide .
Rush and Dr. Laura , eat your hearts out .
5 . Conservatives are very well accomodated for across FOX News , the Wall Street Journal , the Washington Times , the New York Post , the American Spectator , the Weekly Standard , the Drudge Report , the National Review , etc .
Even so - called " bastions of liberalism , " e.g. the NY Times , MSNBC , WashPost and NPR make a concerted effort to be " fair and balanced " by bringing in right - wing views like those of David Brooks , Joe Scarborough , Tucker Carlson , Charles Krauthammer and Cokie Roberts to have their say in these forums , respectively .
This is in stark contrast to FOX News ' claims to unbiased objectivity , which were easily demolished by Robert Greenwald in 2004.6 .
Contrary to what some paranoid Republicans claim , most journalists are centrists , not liberals .
A representative sample of 141 US journalists and bureau chiefs were asked in 1998 , " On social issues , how would you characterize your political orientation ? "
Answers : Left 30 % , Center 57 % , Right 9 % , Other 5 % .
Next question , same sample : " On economic issues , how would you characterize your political orientation ? " Answers : Left 11 % , Center 64 % , Right 19 % , Other 5 % .
Also , look at the total number of think tank citations in major newspapers , radio and TV transcripts : Conservative TTs : 7792 , Centrist TTs : 6361 , Liberal TTs : 1152.7 .
Eric Alterman summarizes a 1999 research study from the academic journal Communications Research : " Four scholars examined the use of the ' liberal media ' argument and discovered a fourfold increase in the number of Americans telling pollsters that they discerned a liberal bias in their news .
But a review of the media 's actual ideological content , collected and coded over a twelve - year period , offered no corroboration whatever for this view .
"
MYTH 4 .
The US does n’t need improvement compared to other countries ; it is the greatest country in the world .
TRUTH : Wrong again .
I 'll only cite the statistics here .

So much for those " socialist " Europeans and those " backward " Asians , hm ?
We can do better than this .
Miscellany : * Only 18 % of Americans own passports and bother to travel outside of the US .* 85 % of US soldiers in Iraq believe that they are there to get revenge for 9/11 . *
New international student enrollment in US grad schools has decreased by 6 % , because of xenophobic post - 9/11 US visa restrictions , jacked - up tuition fees and better educational opportunities in the EU and Asia .
So no , not everyone wants to come here anymore , because it 's become a land of incredibly limited opportunity , and we 've lowered our educational standards .
MYTH 5 : The US government loves to help other countries .
TRUTH : This is a myth .
The US government tends to be motivated by interests , not humanitarian principles .
Denmark gives the most amount of its GDP ( 1.01 % ) to developing countries ; Norway gives 0.91 % ; the Netherlands give 0.79 % and so on until the end of list , where the USA sits .
Yes , America ranks DEAD LAST in foreign aid at a pathetic 0.1 % of its GDP , compared to the other 21 nations listed as developed nations .
The idea that the US government is a heroic bunch that runs around the world helping the poor and the disempowered is not backed up by the evidence .
We have one of the stingiest governments on earth .
Most Americans believe the US spends 24 % of its budget on aid to poor countries ; the actual amount is well under a quarter of 1 % .
Our country also ranks # 5 on asylum - seeker acceptance rates ( # 1 is Denmark and # 2 is Canada ) .
For you self - congratulatory , redneck - inspired conservative fuckwads who will start to say , " B - b - b - but you 're anti-American !
M-m-m-moonbat !
G - g - g - god bless the USA ! "
I answer , " Go fuck yourself .
We can do better . "
Stop blindly believing everything your president tells you .
Come back to us only when you start realizing that the $ 400 billion your president has allocated to his Roman Empire - style military overstretch could be better spent on correcting the sociopolitical and economic problems in the arenas that I 've listed above .
For you liberal shit - heels who will start to say , " Yeah !
Right on ! "
I answer , " Grow some fucking balls . "
That goes for women and the LGBT community too , and do n't call me a sexist either : I 'm more than comfortable with being a female , but I believe balls can be useful in situations like these .
Instead , stop apologizing for being the " liberal elite , " and start championing un - abashed excellence in everything , not mediocrity .
Help your reps and senators take back Congress , and stop dithering while the political tides are turning in your favor right now .
The conservatives are terrified now ; TAKE advantage of that .
And do n't waste time trying to explain rational things to any homophobic Christians , or hyper- patriotic losers who wave and cheapen our American flag only for a self - esteem buzz , or those testosterone - filled , gullible , culturally - ignorant military recruiter robots who lack even a basic intelligence .
THEY CANNOT BE REASONED WITH .
They do n't understand statistics , elaborate charts , legislative proposals or complicated scientific explanations .
Just let them go .
Let them go .
In the meantime , stop being SHEEP and get up and do something before some bright and ambitious Chinese , Indian and the European students grow up to be international leaders and make your lazy , self - absorbed kids irrelevant on the world stage .
If this is a reasonable manifesto , click " best of , " upper right - hand corner .

Linux Kernel in a Nutshell
This is the web site for the book , Linux Kernel in a Nutshell , by Greg Kroah - Hartman , published by O'Reilly
Written by a leading developer and maintainer of the Linux kernel , Linux Kernel in a Nutshell is a comprehensive overview of kernel configuration and building , a critical task for Linux users and administrators .
No distribution can provide a Linux kernel that meets all users ' needs .
Computers big and small have special requirements that require reconfiguring and rebuilding the kernel .
Whether you are trying to get sound , wireless support , and power management working on a laptop or incorporating enterprise features such as logical volume management on a large server , you can benefit from the insights in this book .
Linux Kernel in a Nutshell covers the entire range of kernel tasks , starting with downloading the source and making sure that the kernel is in sync with the versions of the tools you need .
In addition to configuration and installation steps , the book offers reference material and discussions of related topics such as control of kernel options at runtime .
A key benefit of the book is a chapter on determining exactly what drivers are needed for your hardware .
Also included are recipes that list what you need to do to accomplish a wide range of popular tasks .
To quote me , the author of the book :
If you want to know how to build , configure , and install a custom Linux kernel on your machine , buy this book .
It is written by someone who spends every day building , configuring , and installing custom kernels as part of the development process of this fun , collaborative project called Linux .
I 'm especially proud of the chapter on how to figure out how to configure a custom kernel based on the hardware running on your machine .
This is an essential task for anyone wanting to wring out the best possible speed and control of your hardware .
To quote the " official " O'Reilly site for the book :
To quote me , the author of the book :
This book is intended to cover everything that is needed to know in order to properly build , customize , and install the Linux kernel .
No programming experience is needed to understand and use this book .
Some familiarity with how to use Linux , and some basic command - line usage is expected of the reader .
This book is not intended to go into the programming aspects of the Linux kernel ; there are many other good books listed in the Bibliography that already cover this topic .
I want this book to help bring more people into the Linux kernel development fold .
The act of building a customized kernel for your machine is one of the basic tasks needed to become a Linux kernel developer .
The more people that try this out , and realize that there is not any real magic behind the whole Linux kernel process , the more people will be willing to jump in and help out in making the kernel the best that it can be .
This book is available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution - ShareAlike 2.5 license .
That means that you are free to download and redistribute it .
The development of the book was made possible , however , by those who purchase a copy from O'Reilly or elsewhere
The book is current as of the 2.6.18 kernel release , newer kernel versions will cause some of the configuration items to move around and new configuration options will be added .
However the main concepts in the book still remain for any kernel version released .

NEW YORK — Monday , May 7 , 2007
Voting rights attorney Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has called for prison time for the new US Attorney for Arkansas , Timothy Griffin and investigation of Griffin 's former boss , Karl Rove , chief political advisor to President Bush .
“ Timothy Griffin , ” said Kennedy , ” who is the new US attorney in Arkansas , was actually the mastermind behind the voter fraud efforts by the Bush Administration to disenfranchise over a million voters through ‘ caging ' techniques – which are illegal . ”
[ Hear Kennedy on Griffin , Rove and ‘ caging lists ' below or here ]
Kennedy based his demand on the revelations by BBC reporter Greg Palast in the new
edition of his book , “ Armed Madhouse . ”
On one page of the book , Palast reproduces a copy of a confidential Bush - Cheney campaign email , dated August 26 , 2004 , in which Griffin directs Republican operatives to use the ‘ caging ' lists .
This is one of the emails subpoenaed by Congress but supposedly “ lost ” by Rove 's office .
Palast obtained 500 of these , fifty with ‘ caging ' lists attached .
‘ Caging ' lists are “ absolutely illegal ” under the Voting Rights Act , noted Kennedy on his Air America program , Ring of Fire .
The 1965 law makes it a felony crime to challenge voters when race is a factor in the targeting .
African - American voters comprised the bulk of the 70,000 voters ‘ caged ' in a single state , Florida .
Palast wrote in his book , “ Here 's how the scheme worked .
The Bush campaign mailed out letters , ” particularly targeting African - American soldiers sent overseas .
When the letters sent to the home addresses of the soldiers came back “ undeliverable ” because the servicemen were in Baghdad or elsewhere , the Republican Party would , “ challenge the voter 's registration and thereby prevent their absentee ballots being counted . ”
The Republicans successfully challenged “ at least one million ” votes of minority voters in the 2004 election .
Kennedy , a voting rights attorney , fumed , “ What he [ Griffin ] did was absolutely illegal and he should be in jail .
Instead [ Griffin ] was rewarded with the US Attorney 's office . ”
“ They [ Griffin , Rove and their confederates at the RNC ] knew it was illegal . ”
Kennedy has called on the Senate and House Judiciary Committees to expand their investigations of the firing of US Attorneys to include a probe of their replacements , especially Griffin , as well as Rove 's knowledge of the caging operation .
In preparation for just such an investigation , Kyle Sampson , former aide to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , wrote a confidential email , dated December 19 , 2006 outlining a strategy to stall Congress ' from questioning the propriety of the Griffin appointment .
“ We should gum this to death , ” wrote Sampson , “ Ask the senators to give Tim a chance . . . then we can tell them we 'll look for other candidates , ask them for recommendations , evaluate the recommendations , interview their candidates , and otherwise run out the clock .
All of this should be done in ‘ good faith , ' of course . ”
Sampson has since resigned .
Palast said , “ Just as Rove is known as ‘ Bush 's brain , ' Griffin is ‘ Rove 's Brain . '
I 'm flattered by his ‘ review . ' ”
Palast first reported on the caging list operation for BBC Television 's premier current affairs show , Newsnight , in 2004 .
In a February 7 , 2007 email obtained by subpoena from Rove 's office , Griffin boasted that , “ No [ US ] national media picked up ” the BBC story .
Griffin attached an excerpt of Armed Madhouse .
Griffin sent his remarks to Monica Goodling , Senior Counsel to Attorney General Gonzales , who has since resigned and invoked the Fifth Amendment rather than answer Congressional questions .
Griffin and Rove refused several requests from Palast and BBC to respond to charges of illegal , racial ‘ caging ' of voters .
However , a Republican spokeswoman , while admitting the lists could be used to challenge soldiers ' votes , said that was ‘ not the purpose ' for gathering the lists .
**********
Greg Palast is the author of the New York Times bestseller , ARMED MADHOUSE : From Baghdad to New Orleans — Sordid Secrets and Strange Tales of a White House GONE WILD .

There ’s been a lot of discussion of a recent Pew Research Center study of US voters , mainly focusing on this graph , which certainly suggests a strong reaction against the Bush Administration and the Republican Party
But the underlying picture is much worse for Republicans than this , as Gary Kamiya observes .
On the one hand , the Pew Survey shows that Democrats and Independents are becoming pretty similar in the views to people elsewhere in the developed world ( such as Europeans ) – liberal on social issues , moderately social - democratic in social policy , preferring peace to war and so on .
Not surprisingly , this translates to a strongly negative view of the Republican party , just as it does everywhere else in the world .
On the other hand , Republican support is contracting to a base of about 25 per cent of the population whose views are getting more extreme , not merely because moderate conservatives are peeling off to become Independents , but also because of the party ’s success in constructing a parallel universe of news sources , thinktanks , blogs , pseudo - scientists and so on , which has led to the core becoming more tightly committed to an extremist ideology .
There ’s plenty to support this account outside the Pew survey .
This Gallup poll shows that a majority of Democrats and a large plurality of Independents think that the US is spending too much on the military – hardly any Republicans take this view .
The proportion thinking spending is too high is the highest since 1990 and one of the highest on record .
Looking at the Republican side of the aisle , Jonathan Chait points out ( via Matthew Yglesias ) , that even as scientific evidence on global warming has become overwhelming and most of the oil industry has ceased to promote delusional thinking on this issue , the same thinking has hardened within the Congressional Republican party , to the point where Republican members of Congress who are qualified scientists ( amazingly , there are some ) are barred from sitting on committees where they might disrupt the anti-science orthodoxy .
The position of rightwing blogs is even worse , with a recent survey 59 - 0 score in favour of the delusional position .
Looking at the evidence , Gary Kamiya asks whether this is just a swing of the pendulum , and in some respects it is , but some effects are likely to be longer - term .
The general liberalisation of thinking on social issues is unlikely to be reversed .
Moreover , while American faith in military power bounced back after Vietnam , I doubt that the same will be true after Iraq .
If you wanted a textbook lesson in why resort to violence is rarely a sensible choice , Bush ’s presentation of that lesson could hardly be bettered .
I ’ll end with one stat that ought to worry any Republicans who think sticking with the Rove strategy is a good idea .
According to the Pew study , members of Gen Y ( 18 - 30 ) are about as likely to be atheists / agnostics ( 19 per cent ) as Republicans ( no age group breakdown , but it must be less than the 25 per cent for all voters given low party identification in this age group ) .
If all the experts tell you to go right , and you decide to go left , you ’re probably stupid .
But if you get lucky , and discover a pot of gold along the stupid path , people will call you a leader .
You ’ll still be stupid , but fewer people will feel the need to point that out .
When you ’re in charge , there ’s not much payoff in doing what the experts advise .
The best you can achieve by taking the experts ’ advice is the label “ competent . ”
It ’s the faintest of praise .
“ Joe is competent . ”
It sounds like just ba -a - a - arely better than incompetent .
Interestingly , life is too complex to know for sure if turning right or turning left will work out best .
Even the experts often get it wrong .
That guarantees a fair number of stupid people will be judged great leaders .
They ’ll take the wrong turn and things will turn out right .
President Reagan was either a brilliant visionary who won the Cold War , or a walking cabbage that happened to be in office when the Soviet Union crumbled on its own .
Pick one .
The elder and original President Bush followed expert advice more often than not .
History will view him as a competent President .
President Clinton was about the same – competent .
His son , President Bush , is bucking the experts on almost everything .
There is a nonzero chance that global warming turns out to be no big deal , and Iraq turns into a functioning democracy .
The odds are tiny , say the experts , but life is inherently unpredictable .
President Bush is stupid by definition , since he ignores experts in many fields .
But we wo n’t know for 50 years whether he ’s a great leader .
With the county dodging a post - Labor Day spike in coronavirus cases , the Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to allow a limited number of schools to apply for waivers to offer in - person instruction for students in pre-kindergarten through 2nd grade .

Today an underground hacker team " web- Hack " from Russia released a whitepaper with results of iPhone firmware research .
They reverse- engineered some functions and published this information .
Results of a research shocked community .
Russian hackers found a built - in function which sends all data from an iPhone to a specified web - server .
Contacts from a phonebook , SMS , recent calls , history of Safari browser - all your personal information can be stolen .
At present there is no additional information about this issue .
Researches assume that this function either a debug feature or a built - in backdoor module for some governmental structures .
Anyways this function can be used by a trojan - developers or activated by the AT&T .
We will monitor all information about this accident and will publish it immediately .

Just because they have a TOOL for backing up your data , does n't mean it inst going through the sniffer .
And , if it can be used this way , why not the other ?
After all were talking AT&T .
Can you hear me now ?
Your World Delivered !
Alan , You must work for them ?
Frankly it would not be surprising if the data is being sent by proxy to govt agencies for surveillance .
I recall AT&T was sued for Aiding in Data Surveillance for the Govt :
" AT&T Sued for Role in Aiding US Government Surveillance "
from https://mobilebackup.att.com/how_it_works.html
" the application is set to automatically back up your contacts to a secure server on a weekly basis "
This specifies that only phone " Contacts " are backed up through the client software .
Why then are SMS messages , Recent calls and Browsing History data sent to this server .
Besides the Cingular website specifies that the software must be downloaded and installed and only supports specific phones :
https://mobilebackup.att.com/phones_supported.html
Even if for some reason this client software was installed by default why then was it not advertised as so ?
Cleary this is a sign of how we live in a surveillance society .
And you should care , one has the right to privacy and dignity , this is the society you live in .
Welcome to 1984 .
Iphone owns you .
Resistance is futile , you will be assimilated .
This is impemented by law .
When the frequences and protocols was granted to motorola , they where forced by CIA / USA to implement a backdor .
This is only protected by a 4 - bit code , an is easyli hacked / craced .
When so - the phone can be used as a rom srvy system without the users knowledge .
I guess tah tis " act " alo was inforced on apple , since they , as is all the other cell phone companies , still uses a motorola chip in the heart of the GSM system !

We all know Apple iPhone is very rich in multimedia features including Internet capabilities ... and of course the price is n't affordable to the average people ...
So if you own this Gadget I think it 's better to have an extra care specially the screen , it needs Incase iPhone Slider Case to protect your iPhone from unwanted scratch .
This is only an advice ... do n't think it seriously if you do n't want .

HB 4564 ACTION ALERT
... released by radical , angry feminist group .
HB 4564
As predicted this organization which once stood for EQUALITY has NOW been hijacked by radical feminists that are hell bent on control and labeling men as abusers .
Children no longer need to be in a tug - of - war of their controlling agenda .
HB4564
Michigan Children deserve better !
Michigan Children deserve Michigan House Bill 4564 ( HB 4564 ) .
Domestic Violence and HB 4564 HB 4564
Sadly , for political reasons and the continuation of gender warfare some opponents state that MI HB 4564 will cause more women to be abused !
This scare tactic works well !
Domestic Violence is to always be taken seriously .
Michigan House Bill 4564
What the radical groups do not tell you is that MI HB 4564 does NOT change ANY laws related to Domestic Violence .
Current laws and protections will stay in place .
Apparently they want to convince our lawmakers that all men are abusive and thus all men and children should be ripped apart after a divorce or separation .
Their statements also expose their blatant discrimination and bigotry against one gender .
Michigan House Bill 4564
At the expense of children , politics are once again being played and the gender war is being needlessly continued .
The statistics that are used to trick our elected officials can easily be challenged if society is ready to acknowledge that BOTH genders can and do commit Domestic Violence !
In fact , the APA American Psychological Association President recently admitted that both genders commit domestic violence at almost the same rate .

Geek Page - Scripting Languages
Programming for the masses .
The development of fancy graphical interfaces has finally made computers usable by normal humans .
But computer programming remains an arcane art , understood only by members of the technical priesthood .
This will have to change .
A growing community of digital artists and other right - brained types are beginning to demand the power and flexibility that can only be achieved with programming .
A good example is the animation and special - effects industry .
If you see a complex video effect on TV , like a dancing gas pump , chances are it was created by programmers .
Buttons and menus can't provide the control that such artistic effects demand .
The same phenomenon recurs in CD - ROM production , Internet publishing , and even mundane ( but complex ) tasks like system administration .
All these jobs would become much easier if specialists could work directly with the computer , instead of relying on programmers to interpret their ideas .
Unfortunately , we can't force artists and system administrators to learn traditional programming - or expect programmers to be artists .
Instead , we need to find some way to make computer programming so easy that anyone can do it .
The answer lies in the nascent field of scripting languages .
Scripting languages , such as Lingo and Tcl ( pronounced " tickle " ) , are programming languages that are very easy to learn and use .
Scripting gives non-technical users a richer , more expressive way to work with computers .
And even trained programmers are starting to use scripting languages to quickly create simple applications .
For example , in Tcl / Tk ( which combines the Tcl language with a tool kit for building graphical interfaces ) , you can create a working application with only two lines of code :
button .myButton - text
" Hello " - command exit
pack .myButton
When you run this script , it displays a window with a button in it .
Click on the button , and the program exits .
It 's simple , but the same program written in C , with an interface tool kit comparable to Tk , requires a full page of ugly code .
That 's pretty impressive , and it does n't involve any revolutionary technology .
Scripting languages just have a different emphasis .
Like the Macintosh , they 're the same old tools , with a new user interface .
The simplest way to put a user interface on programming is to make it prettier .
Conventional programming languages look like physics formulas , with thickets of punctuation .
Scripting languages are more attractive .
An extreme example is Apple 's HyperCard , which looks a lot like English .
Instead of " a = b " , a HyperCard user says " put a into b . "
This enchants users at first , but the extra verbiage can come to seem clumsy .
Another common - sense approach to making languages easier to use is to make them more powerful .
A C programmer works directly at the level of the machine , pushing around various bits and bytes .
If more sophisticated operations are built into a language , it is easier to write more sophisticated jobs .
For example , the concept of character strings is n't built into C , so users have to call an external function to connect two strings - " strcat ( a , b ) " .
Most scripting languages have strings already built in , so users just say " a+b " .
These simple techniques help make programming more manageable .
But as any amateur programmer can tell you , the trickiest part of programming is thinking like a computer .
The sheer power of the machine is intimidating .
So , just as the Macintosh masks the power of its file system with the metaphor of a desktop , good scripting languages use interface metaphors to make the computer look friendlier and less powerful .
C's interface model , for example , is procedural .
A program is a collection of subprograms , called procedures ; the machine can leap from one to another at any time .
It 's a powerful metaphor , but keeping track of where the flow of control is coming from and where it 's going to requires serious concentration .
Scripting metaphors tend to be easier .
Many scripting languages aimed at system administrators , like Tcl and Bourne shell , share the batch metaphor .
The script is a list of commands , executed one after another , exactly as if the user had typed them at the command line .
The infamous AUTOEXEC .BAT file , found in MS - DOS , is a common batch script .
The batch metaphor still lets advanced users define new commands - giving it the same power as the procedural model .
However , novice users can invoke system commands without having to understand the control - flow model behind them .
They do n't need to learn any concepts to write their first script .
A third interface metaphor is the object - event model , common in multimedia scripting .
Here , the user defines the application in terms of concrete objects .
An object might be a button , a picture , or an animated cartoon character .
The objects respond to events , like mouse clicks , by executing batch - like scripts .
It 's a sophisticated control - flow model ; but , for each object , the user thinks only in sequential terms .
None of these metaphors makes scripting languages fundamentally less powerful or efficient than their conventional counterparts .
However , most modern scripting languages have n't been engineered to provide the horsepower necessary for heavy - duty programming .
In order for artists and engineers to cooperate in the digital era , a new generation of industrial - strength scripting languages needs to be developed .
Curtis Yarvin ( curtis@xaostools.com ) would say more , but his employer , Xaos Tools Inc. , might not dig it .

Desks and walls could one day light up electronics without need for cables .
This table can power a light placed above it — even one that 's underwater .
Takao Someya and colleauges
Annoyed by the tangle of power cords under your desk ?
A sheet of plastic invented by researchers in Japan could one day make for tables and walls that power devices placed on them — without any need for wires or plugs .
Computers could be powered through the desks on which they sit , for example , or flat - screen televisions through the walls where they hang .
The team of seven researchers at the University of Tokyo has produced a sample sheet of the plastic , which is about the size of a very thin magazine — just one millimetre thick and weighing 50 grams .
It can deliver up to 40 watts of power to products on or near it that contain a special ' receiving coil ' : enough to power a lightbulb or a very small laptop .
They say that scaled - up production of such sheets could be inexpensive enough for widespread installation in desks , floors , ceilings and walls , ushering in a " new class of electronic devices " .
The plastic , described today in Nature Materials1 , has as its base a layer of transistor featuring pentacene , an organic molecule whose electrical conductivity can be controlled .
Topping that are layers holding copper coils that can sense whether a compatible electronic device is nearby , microelectromechanical - system ( MEMS ) switches that serve to turn on and off the power , and copper coils to transmit electricity .
When the sheet itself is plugged in , it can power devices — such as light - emitting diodes ( LEDs ) strung on a Christmas tree — that are built with a matching receiver coil .
When these are placed within 2.5 centimetres of the sheet , the nearest MEMS switch turns on , feeding power to the closest sender coil , which powers the device 's receiving coil through induction .
The researchers say the transmission of power happens with 81.4 % efficiency — compared to 93 % efficiency in the wired grid network as a whole — with a " quite low " level of leaked electromagnetic radiation .
As a demonstration of the product 's safety , the paper shows it powering an LED at the bottom of a bowl containing water and a live fish .
All four layers are produced by literally printing them — the coils using screen printing , the switch and transistor layers with an ink - jet printer ( using special electronic inks ) .
So the product is thin , lightweight and mechanically flexible .

Wireless power systems are nothing new : many electric toothbrushes are charged wirelessly by standing them in a powered base where electrical contacts come in touch with each other , for example .
And several companies offer power ' pads ' that , when plugged in , will charge specially developed devices , such as compatible mobile phones , simply by placing them anywhere on the pad 's surface .
But these use silicon - based transistors , which are harder to manufacture and so are more expensive .
Printable organic transistors can theoretically be made of any size , at a considerably lower cost .
Roger T. Howe , an electrical engineer at Stanford University in Palo Alto , California , is impressed by the work .
" The demonstration of both organic transistors and MEMS switches in a useful system makes it impressive , " he says .
But do n't throw out your power cords yet : the researchers say that these plastic power sheets probably wo n't hit the market for 5 years , while they improve their reliability and stability .
However , they have received " lots of feedback from many companies " , and project a target manufacturing cost of US $ 100 per square metre .
Then there 's still the trick of getting device manufacturers to put the receiving coils into their products to make them compatible .
But should that happen , you may someday enjoy a world with ubiquitous power — and no power cords .

Rules of Chogeyness # 254 : Wearing a tux to work automatically makes you a chogey .

It is obvious the subject ( and photographer ) of this photo has reached an advanced stage of chogeyness .
Note his expression and the cut of his shirt .
Pure chogeyness .
Original link to “ Work Sucks . ”
Although Dr. Sam Harris ’ " Letter to a Christian Nation " is only about 100 pages in length , I would argue it is even more persuasive than his much - acclaimed " The End Of Faith . "
Although Dr. Harris , once again , sinks deep into the morality morass , he nevertheless presents an irrefutable argument for apostasy from the primitive Christian mythology .
I , myself , am an apostate , having left Catholicism several years ago .
[ I became an atheist after studying anthropology , biology , philosophy , Darwin ’s theory of evolution and cosmology , among other academic endeavors . ]
This piece presents ten sound reasons to abandon the Christian faith .
Dr. Harris ’ book inspired this discussion , and the various bullet - points often will contain quotes from his text .
After my concise rundown , I shall share five choice Bible passages , which should make apostasy even more natural .
1. Christianity — in all its obnoxious denominations — is illogical , irrational , unreasonable and , of greatest import , unscientific .
From mammalian parthenogenesis to talking nonhuman animals , from repeated corpse resurrection to impossible human longevity , this particular brand of mythology is unscientific to its core .
Various absurdities , found in both the Old and New Testaments , simply cannot be reconciled with science - based reality and natural principles .
2 . The Bible , in the not - too - distant past , reasonably has been interpreted to permit — or even condone — “ witch ” burnings , slavery , torture , female subservience and all manner of detestable horror .
True , some passages in the Good Book speak about love , charity , forgiveness and solidarity .
However , other passages — equally numerous if not more — prescribe stoning people to death for fictitious offenses such as gathering sticks on the Sabbath .
In short , the very same tome that pious people clutch in church on Sundays was in the bloodstained hands of murderous primitives inflicting the thumbscrew on innocents guilty only of non-conformity in a Christofascist , pre-scientific world .
3. James Ussher 's Bible - based dating of Creation — that it took place nightfall before October 23 , 4004 BCE — is egregiously , laughably fictitious .
As Dr. Harris snickers , “ This is , incidentally , about a thousand years after the Sumerians invented glue . ”
A 6000 - year - old Earth is so absurdly in conflict with the evidence as to make the proposition strictly comical and unworthy of scholarly attention .
In contrast to the Bible ’s small and young ( and non-existent ) universe , cosmologists have discovered that there are more than one hundred billion ( 10 ^ 11 ) galaxies in our universe , each featuring hundreds of billions of stars .
The sun — the center of our solar system — is merely an ordinary star , in an ordinary galaxy .
Our universe is roughly 13.7 billion years old .
And , who knows if we might live in some sort of grand cosmic multiverse , of which our universe is merely an insignificant speck .
4 . Atheism is the only consistent position with respect to faith - based religious mythology .
Christians , for example , are non-believers with respect to every faith except Christianity .
Christians are utterly atheistic about every deity ( of the infinitely many which could be conceived ) except Yahweh .
How oddly inconsistent .
Muslims , too , reject every world religion save for Islam , which , to them , has a monopoly on absolute Truth .
How is it reasonable to reject 10,000 faith - based religions , yet cling to the absolute authority of one ?
The only reasonable method by which to choose one religion over another would be hard evidence — something all modern religions lack equally .
Absent hard evidence , is n't faith in Yahweh equal to faith in Enlil ( or any other fantastical imagining ) ?
5. Historic “ heroes ” of Christianity are worthy neither of respect nor reverence .
Dr. Harris writes ,
“ It was even possible for the most venerated patriarchs of the Church , like St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas , to conclude that heretics should be tortured ( Augustine ) or killed outright ( Aquinas ) .
Martin Luther and John Calvin advocated the wholesale murder of heretics , apostates , Jews and witches . ”
Here , once again , we return to severe punishments prescribed for fictitious offenses .
The Christofascist societies of centuries past ( ruled over by the same Bible one finds at Sunday Services ) bear a frightening resemblance to the modern - day Islamofascist Middle East , into which we have butted our collective nose .
6 . Yahweh is woefully unworthy of worship .
As portrayed in the Old Testament , he is the very embodiment of human frailty : vicious , vengeful , jealous , egotistical , insecure and , most frighteningly , endlessly murderous .
Yahweh also seems to have difficulty separating the important from the insignificant , as evidenced by the Ten Commandments .
Dr. Harris writes , “ And what are we to make of the fact that , in bringing his treatise to a close , the creator of our universe could think of no human concerns more pressing and durable than the coveting of servants and livestock ? ”
Yahweh ’s special list of ten alternates between self - aggrandizement , statements of the obvious , pronouncements of the silly and declarations of the trivial .
7. No God , the Christian character or otherwise , should be worshipped given the results with which we live .
If Yahweh is real , then cancer , smallpox , AIDS , malaria and aphasia are all products of his cloud - enshrouded laboratory .
“ Acts of God ” such as Hurricane Katrina and the devastating tsunami of a few years ago are exactly that — the life - extinguishing playthings of the creator of the cosmos .
Then there are starvation , homelessness , birth defects , genetic disease … .
8 . Piety can directly result in mass death .
Dr. Harris writes , “ Christian missionaries have been known to preach the sinfulness of condom use in villages where no other information about condoms is available .
This kind of piety is genocidal . ”
He continues , in a note , “ If you can believe it , the Vatican is currently opposed to condom use even to prevent the spread of HIV from one married partner to another . ”
This is truly sickening , folks .
In the fundamentalist mind , agonizing death is preferable to the imagined sin of sex aided by contraceptive .
9. Virulent Christian anti-Semitism helped create the environment in which the Holocaust took place .
Dr. Harris writes , “ … the anti-Semitism that built the Nazi death camps was a direct inheritance from medieval Christianity .
For centuries , Christian Europeans had viewed the Jews as the worst species of heretics and attributed every societal ill to their continued presence among the faithful .
While the hatred of Jews in Germany expressed itself in a predominantly secular way , its roots were religious , and the explicitly religious demonization of the Jews of Europe continued throughout the period .
The Vatican itself perpetuated the blood libel in its newspapers as late as 1914 .
And both Catholic and Protestant churches have a shameful record of complicity with the Nazi genocide . ”
10 .
Let us turn , for just a moment , to the admirable " Atheist Universe " by David Mills : “ The Church angrily denounced the introduction of medicines , antibiotics , anesthesia , surgery , blood transfusions , birth control , transplants , in vitro fertilization and most forms of pain killers .
Supposedly , these scientific tools interfered with nature and were therefore against God ’s will . ”
The Church ’s modern - day anti-science positions , obviously , should come as no shock .
Diminishing human suffering never has been a high - level concern .
After all , in a mind deranged by religion , there is another life to which to look forward .
The earthly is merely ephemeral and , thus , suffering is a - ok .
A Supplement : Five “ Classic ” Bible Passages
And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness , they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day .
And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron , and unto all the congregation .
And they put him in ward , because it was not declared what should be done to him .
And the LORD said unto Moses ,
The man shall be surely put to death : all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp .
And all the congregation brought him without the camp , and stoned him with stones , and he died ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
Numbers 15:32-36
If thy brother , the son of thy mother , or thy son , or thy daughter , or the wife of thy bosom , or thy friend , which is as thine own soul , entice thee secretly , saying , Let us go and serve other gods , which thou hast not known , thou , nor thy fathers ;
Namely , of the gods of the people which are round about you , nigh unto thee , or far off from thee , from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth ;
Thou shalt not consent unto him , nor hearken unto him ; neither shall thine eye pity him , neither shalt thou spare , neither shalt thou conceal him :
But thou shalt surely kill him ; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death , and afterwards the hand of all the people .
And thou shalt stone him with stones , that he die ; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God , which brought thee out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage .
And all Israel shall hear , and fear , and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you .
Deuteronomy 13:6-11
Now therefore kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him .
But all the women children , that have not known a man by lying with him , keep alive for yourselves .
Numbers 31:17-18
And Moses said ,
Thus saith the LORD , About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt :
And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die , from the first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne , even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill ; and all the firstborn of beasts .
And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt , such as there was none like it , nor shall be like it any more .
Exodus 11:4-6
And he said unto them , Thus saith the LORD God of Israel , Put every man his sword by his side , and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp , and slay every man his brother , and every man his companion , and every man his neighbour .
And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses : and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men .
Exodus 32:27-28
Baptism is merely a meaningless incantation and a splash of water .
One must not let oneself live a life of blind faith , when the evidence — and our species ’ innate moral imperative — so obviously guide us away from the Bible .

Announcing Head First Scheme
We 're proud to announce that the next book in the successful Head First series will cover the incredibly exciting programming language known as Scheme , described by some folks at MIT as " ... a statically scoped and properly tail - recursive dialect of the Lisp programming language " .
Wow !
If that does n't work up your passion for programming , you should n't be coding .
The four of us have spent the last 3 months secretly writing Head First Scheme , and while the tragically - underappreciated language may not have taken over the world yet , it should and it will .
Sure , Java 's cool and all , but seriously -- can you really trust your mission - critical apps to a language named for a hot beverage ?
Once again , Tim O'Reilly has proved his savvy ( and bravery ) in allowing us to do the book we wanted -- market size be damned .
Preorders will start on Amazon beginning April 1 !
Order yours now , and await all the tail recursion , closures and Y - combinators you 'd ever want .
As we 've subtitled this book , it is a " brain - based guide to programming nirvana . "
And we think it 's the perfect language for just about anything : teaching , enterprise backends , mobile devices ( we even have a tutorial on The Little Toaster - - with a Scheme interpreter running on a variety of kitchen appliances ) , and of course any kind of Web Service .
Have fun !

April 1st ?
Hmmm ... :)

* Sigh * , if only it were so .
I 'd far rather read about scheme than java .
Posted by : pat eyler | Apr 1 , 2005 1:51:27 PM
YOU BASTARDS ! ;-)
I LOVE your writing in the Head First series , but I despise Java .
I 've muddled through with the crippled beverage language only because I enjoy your insights into the learning process and your presentation techniques .
I 've been hoping against hope that you would choose to write a book about Common Lisp ... and then you MOCK me with an April Fool 's joke about another Lisp family member ?
Oh , the humanity .
The Lisp market is actually MUCH larger than you would ever suspect ... and Tim O'Reilly
IS leaving money on the table and talented programmers out in the cold .
Apress is apparently one of the only publishers that has a clue ...
For your atonement , you should write a Head First Common Lisp book ;-)
I mean it , dammit , get started !

Now you 've gone and made me sad .
Well , a little sad .
I 'd love to see this book in the real world .

I 'll admit it , I fell for it .
I have n't been here long enough .
Maybe Fortran would have tipped the " hmm meter " for me .

Too bad it 's a joke .
I 'd buy !

Cool cover , reminds me of Bill Nye the Science guy look .
I would have bought it :)

Well ya never know , keep the pressure on and we may just have to do this book . ;)
Keep cons / car / cdr'ing !

Yea , it was n't really funny , just annoying to find out that there 's not going to be a book .
Posted by : Anon | Apr 1 , 2005 8:57:59 PM
have to agree , just pissed me off .
More java trash , I guess .
Posted by : anon | Apr 2 , 2005 8:11:04 AM
I wish it was a real book , too .
Posted by : Anonymous Coward | Apr 2 , 2005 12:25:16 PM
I happen to know that this is the book Eric and Beth would pretty much KILL to write ... but unfortunately , Java is what 's kept us alive so far .
The market for Java books is much greater than with any other language , and even Java book sales are a mere fraction of what they used to be .
This is a very tough way to pay the rent , but we love it .
It does mean we 're tied to doing things on subjects that have enough people who'd be willing to buy the book .
The moment someone can come up with the numbers that suggest there 's a large enough market to justify the months that Eric and Beth would be working on it , you can bet they 'll be on Tim O'Reilly 's doorstep with a proposal !
We did n't mean to piss anybody off though : )
And actually all of the next books we have planned are * not* on Java , but they 're still on things that are likely to at least break even .
The four of us wish we could all win the lottery and write ( and publish ) the books an * all * the topics we REALLY want to do ...
* sigh *

I 'd buy this book . =)

Oh , it is bad that it is only a Joke , I was trying to find where to buy it until I 've came back to this place again and noticed it was just joke .
Very very disaponting :(
The joker deserves an A indeed .

It is a real pity that this book does
not exist .
My husband is a man in love
Lisp and an eternal student of Scheme .
Since we met , I have been listening
all about the virtues of functional
programming .
He used to be a happy guy
programming in common lisp .
But now ...
after the dot com bubble he is trapped
programming in java and C sharp and has
lost part of his joyous spirit .
I would
buy him this book .

I only read this today , its the 3rd over here now , and my immediate reaction was .
Damm did a book without me being involved with the review process .
I was not impressed .
Luckily reading some of the comments made me realize it was all an April Fools joke .
I read it 2 days late but you guys can chalk me " gottha " .
Good one .
Posted by : Johannes de Jong | Apr 3 , 2005 5:17:05 AM
Ditto what Kathy said , in fact , I should confess in another life I had the privilege of studying under Dan Friedman ( Scheme master & author of such greats as the Little Lisper / Schemer ) and hanging around the IU CS department with all the great Schemers there ( Dybvig , Springer , etc. ) .
So Scheme is in my blood .
You know , it 's a long shot , but I could see a Scheme / Intro programming book being written in the Head First style .
If you 've got a good feel for the Head First philosophy ( read the books and read Kathy 's posts ! ) , feel free to send us a few pages of Head First Scheme ( a little known fact : all Head First authors have to go through an " audition " ) .
Who knows , maybe O'Reilly would be interested , especially if it made sense in the academic market .
( But remember , I 'm do n't speak for O'Reilly ; ) )

What the hell !
I actually checked on Amazon for the pre-order info ?
So cruel of you !
Why can't you just make it real for us .
Please .....

I would love to buy this book .
This is the cruelest April Fools joke I 've seen this year .

It 's a real pity that the Head First Scheme book wo n't see the market .
I believe it can have a future as a teaching book in schools and universities .
Anyway , Kathy , could you give a hint about which books are coming out next ?

At least I spotted the date :-)
Ah well .

what a disappointing way to start the week

I put this on my ( pen-and - paper ) book wishlist before I realized it was an April Fool 's joke .
Good joke , but I would 've bought the book .
Looking back I guess putting the Y - combinator on the cover should 've tipped me off .

A panel of judges at the Copyright Royalty Board has denied a request from the NPR and a number of other webcasters to reconsider a March ruling that would force Internet radio services to pay crippling royalties .
The panel 's ruling reaffirmed the original CRB decision in every respect , with the exception of how the royalties will be calculated .
Instead of charging a royalty for each time a song is heard by a listener online , Internet broadcasters will be able pay royalties based on average listening hours through the end of 2008 .
The ruling is a huge blow to online broadcasters , and the new royalty structure could knock a large number of them off the ' Net entirely .
Under the previous setup , radio stations would have to pay an annual fee plus 12 percent of their profits to the music industry 's royalty collection organization , SoundExchange .
It was a good setup for the webcasters , most of whom are either nonprofits or very small organizations .
National Public Radio spearheaded the appeal , arguing that the CRB 's decision was an " abuse of discretion " and saying that the judges did not consider the ramifications of a new royalty structure .
Under the new royalty schedule , NPR will see its costs skyrocket .
The judges were unmoved by the webcasters ' arguments .
" None of the moving parties have made a sufficient showing of new evidence or clear error or manifest injustice that would warrant rehearing , " wrote the CRB in its decision .
" To the contrary ... most of the parties ' arguments in support of a rehearing or reconsideration merely restate arguments that were made or evidence that was presented during the proceeding . "
SoundExchange is jubilant over the ruling .
Executive Director John Simson called the CRB 's ruling a victory for performing artists and record labels .
" Our artists and labels look forward to working with the Internet radio industry — large and small , commercial and noncommercial — so that together we can ensure it succeeds as a place where great music is available to music lovers of all genres , " said Simson in a statement .
Noble words , but after today 's ruling — which will take effect on May 15 unless the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit agrees to hear an appeal — there probably wo n't be much of an Internet radio industry left for SoundExchange to work with .
In a case of unfortunate timing , the SaveNetRadio coalition today launched a campaign to save Internet radio .
Given the CRB 's decision , it may be too little , too late .
1 Big Mac Is Worth 60 Pork Rinds
Morning , Apples !
Our editor , Sara , pointed out a few great blog conversations going on in regards to fast food restaurants making – or rather , not making – nutrition information available ( and subsequently gave herself an assignment ! ) .
We all had a lot of fun just now coming up with some not - so - pretty comparisons for this and future Sisson Spoofs .
( I blogged about the problem with making nutritional information available in fast food restaurants here . )
After checking out today ’s Spoof , I encourage you to join the blogosphere conversation by heading over to the Calorie Lab News and Brian ’s Lose Weight With Me blogs .
Speak up !
I know you ’ve got opinions !
The issue at hand : nutritional information inclusion on fast food restaurant menus .
I suggest the following visual comparison format so the patrons of America might get a more accurate picture of what they ’re about to consume .
When everything in the restaurant is high in calories , fat , sugar and sodium , what good does publishing the numbers do ?
Because if you knew that …
A Big Mac sandwich ( 540 Calories , 29 grams of fat )
( Jim Frazier Photo )
Was really like 60 deep fried pork rinds …
… then you might think twice .
( Click here for McDonald ’s nutrition information . )
Remember when I blogged about KFC ’s kick - the - bucket in a previous Spoof ?
You ’ll be glad the Bees are such blog surfin ’ fanatics , because this post from Jeff Kay at the Diet Blog is a can ’t - miss .
Scoot !
Next week ’s comparison :
What are you really getting when you bite into those avocado egg rolls from the Cheesecake Factory ?

According to my blog , it 's been 24 days that I 've joined the Mono Team at Novell , and I have n't yet blogged about what I am doing there .
Appart from a week in Seattle with Rodrigo and Miguel , where we 've been attending a Compiler Lab hosted by Microsoft , I 've been mainly working on the linker
The linker is something Miguel wants to have since quite a bit of time , as one can find references to it on his blog in posts that are almost three years old .
Thanks to the Google Summer of Code 2006 , I started working on it .
To make it short , here is a definition of what a linker is , here is the definition extracted from its page on the Mono wiki :
Writing a linker is not very hard .
It 's basically a mark and sweep operation , but the mark operation have to be very intrusive , and you have to dig in every piece of metadata so you do n't forget any type , or any methods .
Plus , there is also a few types in the BCL that are used inside the runtime ( like StackOverflowException for instance ) , and some of them with a field layout that is tied to an unmanaged representation in the runtime ( AppDomain for instance ) .
That makes it very easy to forget something .
But today , after much fighting , I managed to have a non-trivial application working after a complete linking of itself and the base class library .
This application is now famous , and have been used by thousands of users to test if their own application could be run of Mono .
You 've recognized MoMa .
It maybe looks like a simple application , but it uses stuff like System .
Windows .
Forms , System .
Web .
WebServices or even Mono .
Cecil to do its job .
And all it all , it 's not that simple , believe me .
So , here is a little table where I 've gathered some data about the size of the assemblies referenced by MoMa , before , and after having ben linked :
So for the MoMa case , it 's almost a reduction of half the size of the binaries needed to run it .
Pretty good heh ?
That 's really convenient for people who embed Mono for the sake of running their own application .
By using the linker , they can ship with only what they need to run their application .
Next time , I 'll tell you about some limitations of the linker , and the solution to get over them .
Old -line Republican warns ' something 's in the works ' to trigger a police state Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday July 19 , 2007 Print This Email This Enjoy this story ?
Get headlines instantly with RSS .
Thom Hartmann began his program on Thursday by reading from a new Executive Order which allows the government to seize the assets of anyone who interferes with its Iraq policies .
He then introduced old - line conservative Paul Craig Roberts -- a former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under Reagan who has recently become known for his strong opposition to the Bush administration and the Iraq War -- by quoting the " strong words " which open Roberts ' latest column : " Unless Congress immediately impeaches Bush and Cheney , a year from now the US could be a dictatorial police state at war with Iran . "
" I do n't actually think they 're very strong , " said Roberts of his words .
" I get a lot of flak that they 're understated and the situation is worse than I say .
...
When Bush exercises this authority [ under the new Executive Order ] ... there 's no check to it .
It does n't have to be ratified by Congress .
The people who bear the brunt of these dictatorial police state actions have no recourse to the judiciary .
So it really is a form of total , absolute , one - man rule .
...
The American people do n't really understand the danger that they face . "
Roberts said that because of Bush 's unpopularity , the Republicans face a total wipeout in 2008 , and this may be why " the Democrats have not brought a halt to Bush 's follies or the war , because they expect his unpopular policies to provide them with a landslide victory in next year 's election . "
However , Roberts emphasized , " the problem with this reasoning is that it assumes that Cheney and Rove and the Republicans are ignorant of these facts , or it assumes that they are content for the Republican Party to be destroyed after Bush has his fling . "
Roberts believes instead that Cheney and Rove intend to use a renewal of the War on Terror to rally the American people around the Republican Party .
" Something 's in the works , " he said , adding that the Executive Orders need to create a police state are already in place .
" The administration figures themselves and prominent Republican propagandists ... are preparing us for another 9/11 event or series of events , " Roberts continued .
" Chertoff has predicted them .
... The National Intelligence Estimate is saying that al Qaeda has regrouped .
...
You have to count on the fact that if al Qaeda 's not going to do it , it 's going to be orchestrated .
...
The Republicans are praying for another 9/11 . "
Hartmann asked what we as the people can do if impeachment is n't about to happen .
" If enough people were suspicious and alert , it would be harder for the administration to get away with it , " Roberts replied .
However , he added , " I do n't think these wake - up calls are likely to be effective , " pointing out the dominance of the mainstream media .
" Americans think their danger is terrorists , " said Roberts .
" They do n't understand the terrorists cannot take away habeas corpus , the Bill of Rights , the Constitution .
...
The terrorists are not anything like the threat that we face to the Bill of Rights and the Constitution from our own government in the name of fighting terrorism .
Americans just are n't able to perceive that . "
Roberts pointed out that it's old - line Republicans like himself , former Reagan associate deputy attorney general Bruce Fein , and Pat Buchanan who are the diehards in warning of the danger .
" It 's so obvious to people like us who have long been associated in the corridors of power , " he said .
" There 's no belief in the people or anything like that .
They have agendas .
The people are in the way .
The Constitution is in the way .
...
Americans need to comprehend and look at how ruthless Cheney is .
... A person like that would do anything . "
Roberts final suggestion was that , in the absence of a massive popular outcry , " the only constraints on what 's going to happen will come from the federal bureaucracy and perhaps the military .
They may have had enough .
They may not go along with it . "

While you 'll never be able to anticipate every question you might be asked in an interview , you can get a head start by developing strong , concise answers to commonly used questions .
Most interviewers will ask similar questions like these to gain knowledge about a candidate 's abilities and qualifications and compatibility with the job and the company .
1 . Tell me about yourself :
This is often the opening question in an interview .
It 's also one of the most difficult if you 're not prepared .
Remember , the interviewer does not want to hear about your hometown or your scrapbooking hobby .
This question calls for your one - minute commercial that summarizes your years of experience and skills and your personality in the context of the job for which you are interviewing .
Get to the point and sell your professional self .
Develop a few brief sentences that demonstrate you have what it takes to do the job -- experience , proven results and desire to contribute .
2 . Why should we hire you ? :
The key to answering any question about you versus your competition is using specifics .
" Everybody is going to speak in generalities , so you need something that will make you stand out a bit , " said Linda , a teacher in Springfield , Ohio .
Give real examples that show them you are best - suited for the job .
Linda says she would point out her achievements and accomplishments throughout her career that are relevant to the open position , as well as her experiences in dealing with different types of students and teaching situations .
Pinpoint the qualities you have that are truly valuable to the company .
3 . Why do you want to work here ?
What do you know about our company ? :
Peter , a physician in Indianapolis , said that research is important in answering these questions .
" I would use this opportunity to show off what I know about the company and , more importantly , how I would fit in . "
Susan , a vice president of benefits in Chicago , said that she would address issues and challenges in the company to demonstrate the depth of her knowledge .
" I usually talk about revenue , numbers of employees , and also challenges in their type of business and how my experience relates to that , " she said .
" I would point out things I have done in similar companies that could address their problems . "
4 . What are your weaknesses ? :
The secret to answering this question is using your weaknesses to your advantage .
" I would turn my weaknesses into strengths , " said Tara , an attorney .
" For example , if my weaknesses include my lack of patience I would then state that because of this , I have learned to take special measures to ensure that I remain calm and attentive . "
Just make sure that you do give a real answer to this question .
None of us is without faults , so do n't pretend that you do not have weaknesses .
5 . What did you dislike about your last job ?
Why did you leave your last job ? :
You need to be cautious about these kinds of questions and make sure you do not end up sounding bitter .
" I would never talk down about my former company , the boss , or my former co-workers , " Tara said .
You need to have a good understanding about the job for which you 're applying to turn this question into a positive one .
It may be best to say that you really enjoyed many aspects of your job , then focus on how this new job will give you the opportunity to contribute more in a particular area that is key to the position .
6 . Where do you see yourself in five years ? :
An interviewer does not want to hear that your five - year aspiration is to be sailing in the Caribbean or working in a different industry .
You need to talk about goals you have that relate to the job .
This will demonstrate that you understand the industry , the company and are motivated to succeed there .
Susan , the director of public relations at a major car rental company , said she would keep her answer specific to her field , such as stating that she sees herself as a vice president of corporate communications .
Preparation is the key to answering any question with poise and confidence .
Always keep in mind -- whatever the question is -- that the interviewer is trying to uncover if you are a good fit and can make a positive contribution in the job .

The Social Security card faces its first major upgrade in 70 years under two immigration - reform proposals slated for debate this week that would add biometric information to the card and finally complete its slow metamorphosis into a national ID .
The leading immigration proposal with traction in Congress would force employers to accept only a very limited range of approved documents as proof of work eligibility , including a driver 's license that meets new federal Real ID standards , a high - tech temporary work visa or a U.S. passport with an RFID chip .
A fourth option is the notional tamper - proof biometric Social Security card , which would replace the text - only design that 's been issued to Americans almost without change for more than 70 years .
A second proposal under consideration would add high - tech features to the Social Security card allowing employers to scan it with specially equipped laptop computers .
Under that proposal , called the " Bonner Plan , " the revamped Social Security card would be the only legal form of identification for employment purposes .
Neither bill specifies what the biometric would be , but it could range from a simple digital photo to a fingerprint or even an iris scan .
The proposals would seem to require major changes to how Social Security cards are issued : Currently , new and replacement cards are sent in the mail .
And parents typically apply for their children before they 're old enough to give a decent fingerprint .
There are also logistical problems to overcome before forcing all of the nation 's employers to verify a biometric card -- given the nation has millions of employers , many of whom may not have computer equipment at all .
" This is an exact example of why IDs are so ludicrous as a form of security , " American Civil Liberties Union legislative counsel Tim Sparapani said .
" Do we really think the migrant workers are going to show up at the pickle farm and the farmer is going to demand ID and have a laptop in the field to check their ID ? "
That 's one of the problems that Rep. Zoe Lofgren ( D - California ) , who heads a key House immigration subcommittee , says she 's thinking about .
" There seems to be a fairly strong sentiment that there needs to be an easy way to reliably enforce whatever rules we adopt and the biometric is something being discussed in all the House bills , " Lofgren told Wired News .
" Obviously every small business is n't going to have a biometric card reader , but perhaps the post office might have a reader since every community in America has a post office . "
The proposed biometric feature would apply to newly issued or replaced Social Security cards -- you wo n't be asked to hand in your old one .
Nevertheless , the plan does n't sit well with privacy and civil liberties advocates like Sparapani .
And immigrant - rights groups foresee rampant database errors , and an inevitable mission drift , with biometric cards -- whether the Social Security card or one of the other cards pushed in the proposals -- being used for purposes other than employment .
Currently , U.S. employers can accept a range of documents , including expired U.S. passports , tribal documents , refugee documents , birth certificates , driver 's licenses and even school report cards , to establish an employee 's eligibility for work .
Michele Waslin , the policy research director at the National Council of La Raza , a Latino civil rights group , supports immigration reform but emphasizes that employment - eligibility verification must be effective and have safeguards .
" This is one provision that would impact every single person that gets a job in the United States , " Waslin said .
" Given the inaccuracy of government databases , it is likely that some Americans will show documents and the answer will come back as a ' non-confirmation ' and ( they ) could be denied employment based on a government mistake . "
Waslin also fears that the existence of a document that proves immigration status will lead to widespread document checks , even from shop clerks .
" You can imagine arriving at a polling place and some people are being asked for a Real ID , while people who look ' American ' are n't asked for a Real ID , " Waslin said .
The controversy is likely to heat up this week .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is set to schedule two weeks of immigration - reform debate Tuesday , setting a deadline for a bipartisan panel of lawmakers to craft legislation that combines tighter border enforcement , avenues for current undocumented workers to earn legal status , and stringent employee - verification requirements for employers .
If they succeed , the bill will probably have roughly the same contours as the leading House bill , known as the Strive Act , co-authored by Reps.
John Flake ( R - Arizona ) and Luis Gutierrez ( D - Illinois ) .
The Strive Act would require employers to verify a new employee 's credentials -- by telephone or the internet -- against databases maintained by the Social Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security .
If the answer comes back as a " non-confirmation , " the new hire would have the opportunity to update any incorrect records .
The Strive Act 's verification system is based on the Basic Pilot Program , a currently voluntary program that lets businesses verify new employees ' work eligibility over the web .
But that program relies on databases prone to inaccuracy , according to Tyler Moran , the employment policy director at the National Immigration Law Center .
" The Basic Pilot program has given more power to employers to oppress workers , " Moran said .
" It 's the worker 's burden to prove they are work - authorized , and employers are taking adverse action when there is a problem , such as demoting or firing workers before they have a chance to correct the database . "
A recent report by the Social Security Administration 's inspector general backs up Moran 's criticism with findings that 17.8 million records in the government 's employment databases contained inaccuracies that could initially and erroneously flag individuals as ineligible for employment .

DRONES , DUDS , ROMNEY & PERRY --- Strange things emanate from some Republican presidential hopefuls , especially as they pander to war hawks on their rabid right .
During the last debate in Sioux City Iowa both Perry and Romney appeared prepared ready to go to war with Iran over the return of a US drone launched from Kandahar Afghanistan that crashed near Kashmar , Iran 140 miles ac cross the Afghan border .
Ironically , " Kashmar " in the Russian language means " nightmare " and there is a good chance that is what the US would have on its hands if either political opportunists like Perry or Romney were in the Oval Office .
At least Ron Paul at the time had the sense to call such saber rattling dangerous and absurd .
Creating war hysteria over Iran is a Republican thing .
It panders to the big time supporters of the Republican Party , ie , the military industrial complex the Israeli Lobby and its Christian Evangelical Zionists ..
Bachmman , Gingrich and Santorum are all on the same band wagon .
It is the same madness , driven by the same interests , that brought the US the disastrous Iraq war ..
Now 68 percent of Americans agree that war was a mistake .
The drone that crashed in Iran was a RQ - 170 Sentinel Drone .
It is a state of the art piece of equipment .
It is nicknamed " the Beast of Khandahar " , and is alleged to have been used in in recent operation against Bin Laden .
CIA had operational control of this Iranian mission .
It will be interesting to learn why the built - in self destruct mechanism did not function .
Was some one asleep at the switch or less likely , did the fail - safe mechanism fail ?
Imagine the delay , panic and bureacratic consternation involved to destroy millions of dollars worth of modern equipment .
CIA has a history of clutching on self - destruct when the chips are down -- Remember Gary Powers in his U2 spy craft shot down over Russia under President Eisenhower - - last time I checked you can see large parts of it in the Red Army Museum in Moscow and Mr Powers is alive and well as he was traded for high - level Soviet spy held in the US .
He had the means and orders to destroy the aircraft and himself in the event of capture .
The US claims that the drone was lost because of a malfunction ; that it was not shot down , and that no cybernetic technology or electronics were involved in the crash .
Iraqis claim that its forces brought it down with electronic warfare .
It is known to have an effective Russian AVTOBAZA jammer .
For the US its capture constitutes an inadvertent transfer of valuable technology , especially the sensors .
One mystery is why the drone with a 66 ft wing span , flying as high as 50,000 feet , remains in good shape after it crashed .
To make it more vexing to the US , the Iranians put the drone on TV and paraded throughout the country for propaganda purposes .
Faced with the dilemma of what to do about the drone once it was lost , the US administration chose to ask diplomatically for its property to be returned .
So far the Iranians have refused .
Other options by the US were rejected .
These include destroying the drone by US aircraft or special operations assault .
Either of these measures could have denied the Iranians the technology , but may have involved US casualties and more equipment loss .
Such activities would have escalated the incident as the Iranians would have met the attack as further provocation .
US forces in Gulf and interests in Iraq are open to Iranian counter measures .
Risk of war was evident as each side would develop military counter strikes .
Obama understood this and took a deep breath and politely asked for his lost drone to be returned .
Doubt that this will happen .
The US had diplomatic problems over its spy platforms previously .
LBJ in 1968 with the USS Pueblo and North Korea , and GW Bush with the Navy reconnaissance aircraft with China in 2001 are examples of incidents when the US backed off use of force to rescue lost intelligence assests .
So duds Perry and Rowney attacked without basis when they mocked the president for his cautious actions over the drone in Iran .
Obama has demonstrated serious weakness economically .
I do not agree with many of his social policies and it is clear he has mismanaged US policy in the Middle East .
He has permitted Israel to make US policy in the peace process .
He has fumbled badly in Egypt , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
He has opened new war fronts in Somalia and other parts of Africa .
His surge in Afghanistan was absurdly pointless .
He is at drawn swords with Pakistan over sloppy warfare incidents .
His pullout from Iraq deserves credit .
He also killed Bin Laden who was right under GW Bush 's nose in Pakistan .
He curbed the Somali pirates .
At least , at this time , fewer US military people are dying under his administration and that is something you will not get in a Republican administration run by screw balls and interventionist neocons .
For the Americans , Republicans and Democrats are equally bad choices -- It is nearly a Hobson choice ..

I am beginning to doubt that moving to Greece was a good idea .
Sure , the eastern Mediterranean was one of the first cradles of mankind , but they also do not use toilet seats .
It worries me sometimes .
I had applied to the University of the Aegean , one of several choices among graduate schools that I felt would be an adventure to attend , but it turns out that my application was lost somewhere between New York and Athens .
It also turns out that I was wait - listed from every other university that I had applied to ( for an astounding total of 2 rejections ) .
Apparently graduate schools in Greece are wary about admitting students who are not Greek .
Something about my " uncultured " New Jersey ancestry .
Or perhaps it was the incident when customs had claimed that I was wanted for espionage .
But that is another story .
It was by sheer genius that I was accepted anyway .
To this day I do not know what happened , but apparently someone had received my application erroneously and sent it along to the right people .
Only , in this case , the right people were the wrong people .
You see , somehow the American embassy received my application and had it forwarded to the University .
This still does not make sense to me , I 'm just repeating what I found out years later .
The problem with all this mail rerouting is that the application arrived 2 weeks after classes had begun .
So it was raining one Monday morning around 3:00 a.m. when I received a phone call informing me that I still owed money for tuition and that I would be expelled from the University if they did not receive my check in the next week .
I was surprised to find out that I was accepted without anyone telling me .
They also accepted me before my application had arrived .
This immediately struck me as odd , but I shrugged it off after observing similar phenomena in the movie Spaceballs and realizing that it hurts too much to think about it .
No shit , so there I was at the University of the Aegean on the Isle of Lesbos , surrounded by lesbians while I worked towards the U.S. equivalent of a master 's degree .
I should note that the lesbians were not all female and many of them were not homosexual , so this was not nearly as exciting as it could have been .
After two years of bashing my brains out trying to understand Greek and get my thesis on Generic Architecture for Information Availability written , it finally came time to profess my research and defend my reason for living .
That is when it all happened .
You see , the toilets at the University of the Aegean do n't have toilet seats .
I have no idea if this is some weird Greek thing or what , but it was really disgusting .
To this day I am in constant praise of the nice modern bathroom facilities used in the U.S.
The problem with the Greek bathroom arrangement is very difficult to discuss , but I will say that it is a very bad idea to change into a suit while you are in a bathroom on the Isle of Lesbos , especially one so medieval as to be in the basement of the Cultural Center of the Municipality of Ermoupolis .
The Cultural Center was acquired by the University for its historic and architectural value and to " preserve our natural heritage . "
I swear that the bathrooms have not been renovated in over 200 years .
Having your pants fall into a hole in the ground , along with your wallet and all your money , is not a fun experience .
I can not recommend it .
So here I am , with no pants , about 30 minutes away from my final defense , which took months of planning and scheduling .
This was a crisis of great magnitude .
In fact , I clearly remember thinking to myself , " Self , this is a crisis of great magnitude . "
So I did what any self - respecting computer science nerd soon to be giving a dissertation would do : I arrived at the hall early , and simply hid behind the podium .
It was glorious !
I cannot begin to describe the pure joy involved when you are speaking about obscure algorithms and case studies , on one of the most stressful days of your life , and in your underwear .
It was absolutely liberating .
The panel that had assembled was clueless !
They had no idea that the distinguished young man testifying to his painfully detailed research efforts was , in fact , not wearing any pants .
I was excited , I was scared , but most of all , I was experiencing freedom .
It was as if all the horrors of academia were melting away all at once in an elaborate display of ridiculous miracles on my final day as a student .
When the panel left the room , no one had suspected a thing .
It was if I got away with murder .
My dissertation passed with flying colors and I ended up receiving my degree .
Weirdly enough , when my degree was finally awarded to me , I also received letters from two members of the panel that reviewed my dissertation .
I knew the men pretty well , as they both helped me get settled into the department after moving to Greece , but apparently they knew me well too .
In both letters the gentlemen thanked me for my research efforts and congratulated me for being the first student to ever give a serious dissertation while wearing Batman underwear .
Apparently they had seen me running on my way to the dissertation hall .
I hear that it caused quite a stir .

In January , James Randi secured a mystery item in a specially designated locker in his Florida office , and challenged clairvoyants everywhere to use their remote viewing skills to divine its nature and claim a million dollar prize .
As usual with Randi ’s contests , there ’s were n’t a lot of takers in the professional psychic biz .
But for perhaps the first time in the history of the supernatural challenges issued by the 79 - year - old skeptic , there was a winner of sorts .
Cryptographer Matt Blaze and a colleague correctly identified the contents of Randi ’s black box from a thousand miles away , using only the powers of their minds .
( The remainder of this post is best read while listening to a midi file of the X - Files theme ) .
Blaze identifies the contents on his website , and in a terse e-mail to 27B Stroke 6 , Randi conceded that that the cryptographer ’s conclusion is correct .
This is n’t the first secret that Blaze has revealed .
In the 1990s , it was Blaze who found the flaw in the Clipper Chip that helped kill the Clinton ’s administration ’s misguided key - escrow dreams .
In 2003 , he published an attack on master - keyed pin tumbler locks that locksmiths had evidently been concealing for years .
And last year he went public with a vulnerability in some law enforcement wiretapping gear .
If Blaze has supernatural talents , we ’ll have to view these Amazing Feats in a whole new light .
In truth , though , this was just another puzzle .
It turns out that Randi published an enciphered clue to the contents of the lock box in his newsletter , to provide evidence later that he had n’t switched the mystery item with something else just to foil the psychics .
The clue was this :
0679
4388
66/27
5 - 14
Blaze and colleague Jutta Degener stared at this puzzle for a bit , then developed a hunch about what the numbers were .
That led them to the identity of the mystery object .
( They are not asking for the million bucks . )
I wo n’t reveal the secret here , in case you want to try cracking the mystery numbers yourself .
For the solution , check out Matt Blaze ’s blog , which also explains things from a cryptographic theory perspective .
As an aside , I ’ll says it ’s a sad state of affairs when the world ’s best psychics are shown up by a couple math geeks .
I assume Sylvia Browne chose not to participate because she ’s embarrassed about a 15 - year - old kidnap victim recently turning up alive , four years after Browne told his parents and a national television audience that he ’d been murdered and his body dumped in a wooded area near two large , jagged boulders .
How this woman sleeps at night is an unsolved mystery that I ’d wager even Blaze ca n’t unravel .

Facebook SAN FRANCISCO 
If you must live on a diet of Lean Cuisine , try the Swedish meatballs .
So advises Wayne Crosby , a 29 - year - old computer programmer who recently spent three months subsisting on the frozen dinners .
He also slept on an air mattress , used a box as a coffee table , and worked about 14 hours a day .
And he gave up a good job at Amazon.com to do it .
Crosby participated in a unique program for aspiring tech entrepreneurs called Y Combinator .
Founded by Paul Graham , a computer programmer who struck it rich during the dot - com boom , Y Combinator combines mentoring with venture capital in hopes of getting the next Google off the ground .
( The name comes from a mathematical term . )
Graham and his team gather a small group of start - ups in Cambridge , Mass . , each summer and California 's Silicon Valley each winter .
Fledgling companies get a bit of money — usually no more than $ 20,000 — and access to Graham 's extensive network of tech executives , venture capitalists , lawyers and other industry insiders .
In exchange , Y Combinator takes a share of the companies ' equity , usually about 6 % .
After three months , the start - ups show off their work in hopes of getting acquired or attracting other investors .
The 2½ - year - old program 's biggest hit so far has been Reddit , a social news site acquired by magazine giant Condé Nast for an undisclosed amount .
But Y Combinator has had enough smaller successes to be marginally profitable — and to generate tons of Web 2.0 buzz .
They include : • Loopt , a cellphone mapping service .
It raised $ 5 million in funding from other venture capitalists .
• Scribd , a website that lets you publish documents online .
It raised $ 3.5 million after graduating .
• Justin.tv , a much talked - about Internet television company .
For more than 100 days , founder Justin Kan has been broadcasting his life around the clock from a camera mounted on his head .
Busting into a clubby system Y Combinator is a big change from the way business is usually done in tech circles .
Start - ups are typically funded by wealthy individuals known as angel investors , who dole out money though a complicated , clubby system of who - knows - whom .
Breaking in is nearly impossible for a young , unconnected programmer , says Robby Walker , Crosby 's 23 - year - old business partner .
The two friends had kicked around several ideas for companies , but had no idea how to start until Walker stumbled on Y Combinator 's website .
They applied and got in .
Crosby quit his job .
( Walker had completed his Ph.D. in computer science . )
Crosby and Walker used their time at Y Combinator to start Zenter , a service allowing people to create PowerPoint - like presentations online .
Last month , after only half a year in business , Zenter was acquired by Google for an undisclosed amount .
But the path was n't easy .
Walker and Crosby had to pack their belongings into a Honda Civic and move halfway across the country on a meager budget .
Walker left a girlfriend behind in Chicago ; Crosby 's pregnant wife stayed in Phoenix .
" It was the scariest thing I 've ever done in my whole life , " Crosby says .
They settled into their sparsely furnished apartment and began frantically writing computer code .
Once a week , they attended a weekly Y Combinator dinner with other members of the program .
Graham hosted and cooked .
( Chicken stew is his specialty , even though he 's a vegetarian . )
At each meal , tech insiders would come and speak with the young entrepreneurs .
One of these speakers , JotSpot CEO Joe Kraus , talked about having his company bought by Google .
Introductions were made , and soon he was helping broker the Zenter deal .
Learning from experience
That kind of connection is what Graham had hoped for when he founded Y Combinator .
He came up with the idea after giving a speech at Harvard University about his own e-commerce start - up , Viaweb , which he sold to Yahoo for $ 49 million in 1998 .
He was telling students they needed to find successful entrepreneurs to fund their start - up ideas .
" I realized that all these people were staring at me expectantly , " Graham says .
" I had this vision of getting a thousand business plans in the mail , so I suddenly added ' but not me ! ' " " And then I felt sort of guilty , " he says .
Y Combinator was born .
The program started small .
But it 's growing fast .
More than 400 companies applied for the 19 spots in this summer 's program .
But the limits of Y Combinator 's model remain unclear .
A typical young tech company should be spending a little less than $ 40,000 a month , says Seth Levine , a venture capitalist at Foundry Group .
Y Combinator gives companies a fraction of that , leaving entrepreneurs " eating ramen and not paying themselves , " he says .
And 6 % is a huge amount of equity to give up for such little money , he says .
Although Levine has shared his expertise with TechStars , a new Colorado program that 's similar to Y Combinator , he says it 's rare to find a business with serious long - term prospects in such a program .
Most start - ups would be better off taking money from friends and family , or seeking it from a business that would benefit from their product , he says .
Once a company bootstraps for a little while , it can then approach traditional venture capitalists and seek investment , he says .
" I like to hear about businesses early , " he says .
One thing Levine and Graham do agree on :
It costs a lot less to start a company than it used to .
Computers are cheaper , and free open - source software is widely available on the Internet , Graham says .
Software improvements have also made coding easier , he says .
2 guys starting out are happy David Zhao and Kevin West are two fledgling entrepreneurs who hope it pays off for them .
The two 24 - year - olds just quit their jobs at Amazon.com and Microsoft to join Y Combinator 's current program .
They 're developing a website called Versionate that lets work groups collaborate on a single document .
" The advice and the connections ( Y Combinator ) provides are invaluable … and the equity stake they take is totally fair , " says West , who is subletting an apartment with Zhao for the summer .
" It 's been a very good experience so far , " Zhao says .

I placed the Erlang - based web tools that I am working on for the development of some of my own applications online .
They are very rough , in that they are a big mix of experimentation and trying to get something working to write some actual applications .
So , the documentation is weak , and there are still certain conventions and features that I need to work out that are not particularly complete yet .
( So it is version 0.0.1 :) )
I am not really concerning myself over making the system polished ; what I wrote were just things that I found myself comfortable to work with .
The two tools are ( with the most dullest of names ) : 1. Weberl is a request handler that uses Yaws .
The difference between this and ErlyWeb is of its heavy dependence on OTP for configuration , and all that OTP provides and that it uses behaviours for controller modules .
It uses SGTE as a templating tool .
2 . Formtool is two things : a special form processor for handling basic forms and their validation , as well as a form generator given a specific form layout .
( I wrote a draft of an academic paper on this project a month or two ago on this , as a joke .
I was going to put that in the archive for this project , but I just got too embarrassed to release it at the last moment . :) )
There are other things I wrote that might find their way into the above , but they are not for public consumption now . :)

You may remember from the past couple weeks a series of stories about Sunni tribes working with U.S. forces in western Iraq ( Anbar province ) to fight against the al Qaeda presence there .
This was hailed as a sign that U.S. forces can be effective in counter - terrorism operations , helpfully providing support for those who argue against redeployment .
Last week I started hearing rumors that a primary leader of those Sunni tribes had taken a bunch of money and skipped town .
There was no reporting on it in English press , just Arabic media , but it ’s starting to filter through .
Marc Lynch picks up the trail :
This story from al - Malaf is currently the talk of the forums : Sitar Abu Risha , head of the Anbar Salvation Council , has allegedly fled Iraq with $ 75 million that the Americans had given him to fight al - Qaeda .
The story links his flight to the near - collapse of the Anbar Salvation Council over infighting among its leadership [ and ] claims that he simply never distributed the American cash to the fighters , who are now threatening to go on strike if they do n’t get paid .
Seeing as how the Anbar Salvation Council has for months now been portrayed as the great American hope in the battle against al - Qaeda , if this story turns out to be true – a big if , given the shaky sourcing to this point – then it would be a rather embarrassing fiasco .
As Lynch says , the sourcing is sketchy , and the story is unconfirmed , but even the fact that it ’s a pervasive rumor is a bad sign .
Sunni tribes will really turn against al Qaeda when they no longer have common cause to fight together against the U.S.
In the meantime , maybe we should stop giving suitcases full of cash to corrupt leaders .
Or at least check their travel itinerary first — a one - way ticket to Jordan is probably a bad sign .
Project Honey Pot Files $ 1B + Lawsuit Against Spammers
Some people think the solution to spam is technical , others think it 's legal , at Project Honey
Pot we were founded under the theory that if you 're going to make a dent in this extremely difficult problem you need the strengths of both .
All week we 've been telling you about new technical services .
Today we 're announcing something different .
On Thursday , April 26 , 2007 at 10:54 am in a court in the Eastern District of Virginia , Project Honey
Pot filed the largest anti-spam lawsuit ever .
Seeking more than $ 1B in statutory damages , the suit was brought on behalf of our members .
It targets a huge swath of spammers .
If you 've harvested email addresses or sent spam in the last two years , chances are you 're on our radar screen and we 're coming after you .
As some of you may have seen , the press coverage of this major announcement has already begun .
A copy of the complaint is available .
This is , of course , only one step in a long journey to make the Internet a better place .
But it 's an especially important step because it was not brought by a single ISP or regional prosecutor .
This suit was brought by you : the volunteer members of Project Honey
Pot representing more than 100 countries around the world .
It was brought , in effect , by the Internet community .
And , as a community , we are sick and tired of receiving spam day after day ... it's time to do something to make it stop .
This suit would not be possible without your help .
It is you who take the time to install honey pot pages , donate MX records , and share the data they generate with us .
Thank you all .
Please keep up the great work .
Now ... let 's go get 'em .
Lawsuit Mini-FAQ
Who is representing Project Honey Pot ?
Jon Praed , the founding partner of the Internet Law Group , is Project Honey Pot 's attorney in the case .
Jon has been called the " Spamhunter General " by the British Tabloids .
He has represented companies like AOL and Verizon in major anti-spam lawsuits , including : Verizon Online v. Alan Ralsky , AOL v. CN Productions , and AOL v. Cybervision Entertainment .
In the world of anti-spam lawyers , Jon is the best of the best .
We could n't be more fortunate than to have him on our team .
Who are you targeting ?
We are targeting anyone who targets our members with email spam , comment spam , or harvesting .
This lawsuit is unique because we believe it is the first major case in the United States to bring a claim against spammers for harvesting email addresses .
While this practice has been a penalty enhancement under the CAN - SPAM
Act since it was passed , in most cases the data was not available in order to prove an address was harvested .
Clearly , Project Honey
Pot has a unique insight into harvesting behavior .
How can I help ?
If you have n't already , sign up to join the Project .
Then install a honey pot on your web server , add a QuickLink to your web pages , donate an MX record from a domain you own , or simply tell a friend about us .
We are able to bring this lawsuit because the Internet community has joined together to pool its information and resources .
The more we work together , the more good we 'll be able to do .
What happens to any money you win in the lawsuit ?
We 're a long way from that , but we 'd like to help out the people who have helped us .
Obviously a large chunk would go to paying legal fees .
Intriguingly , though , since we will know what Project Honey
Pot members provided the data that ends up winning the case , maybe we 'll be able to send them a little bonus . :-)
Where can I get a copy of the complaint ?
Right here .
By the way , this is only Day Four of the Five Days of Project Honey Pot .
We wo n't make any promise that we can top today 's announcement , but there are more great announcements coming tomorrow .
The letter is the result of a flood of requests on Dell 's online suggestion box , IdeaStorm , for Dell PCs pre-loaded with both Linux operating systems and the open - source suite of desktop productivity applications .
John McCreesh , marketing project lead for OpenOffice.org , also asked Dell to consider making a financial contribution to the software 's development .
After launching IdeaStorm , tens of thousands of people posted requests for the Round Rock , Texas - based PC maker to pre-load open source software onto its PCs .
Dell has not made promises , saying it would work to " certify " its PCs for some versions of Linux and would consider taking further action .
The OpenOffice software suite is available for download for free .

Lisp を必要なプログラミング言語にきっちり仕立てることができる.ユーザがテキストエディタのプログラムを書いているのなら,
Lisp をテキストエディタを書くための言語に変えることができる.またCAD ソフトのプログラムを書いているのなら , Lisp をCAD ソフトを書くための言語に変えることもできる.そしてどんなプログラムを書くかまだ確かでないなら,
Lisp で書いておくのが安全な賭けだ.それがどんな種類のプログラムになったとしても,それを書いている間に,
Lisp はその種類のプログラムを書くためのプログラミング言語に進化していることだろう.どんなプログラムを書くかまだ確かでないなら?
人によってはこの文は奇妙に響くだろう.これは(1)これからやることを注意深く計画し,そして(2 ) それを実行する,というモデルとは水と油のように相容れない考え方だ.プログラムのすべき動作を決める前にプログラムを書くことをLisp が勧めているとすれば,このモデルによれば,
Lisp は単に杜撰な考え方を勧めているにすぎないことになる.だが,そんなことはない.「計画−実装」方式もダム建設や侵略作戦の決行にはいい方法だったが,人々の経験によればプログラムを書くのにいい方法だったかどうかは定かでない.なぜか?
きっと,コンピュータは大変正確だからだ.きっと,プログラムはダムや侵略作戦よりもバリエーションが多いからだ.またはきっと,古い概念における冗長性に相当するものがソフトウェア開発にないせいで,古い方式が機能しないことによるのだろう:ダムが30 % 余分なコンクリートを使っていても,それは誤差として許される範囲内だろう.しかしプログラムが30 % 余分な動作をしていたら,それは間違いだ.古い方式が失敗に終わるのがなぜかを言うのは難しいかもしれないが,それが確かに失敗しているのは,誰の目にも明らかだ.ソフトウェアが期日どおりに完成したことがあるだろうか?
熟練プログラマは , どれほど慎重にプログラムの計画を立てても,プログラムを書き始めると,必ず計画にどこか不完全な点が見つかることを知っている.計画が望みのないほどまで間違っていることもある.しかし「計画−実装」方式の犠牲者のほとんどはその基礎の健全さを疑おうとはしない.代わりに彼らは人間の失敗を責める:「もう少しいい展望の下に計画を立ててさえいたら,こんな問題はすべて避けられただろう.」最高レベルのプログラマでさえ実装となれば問題に突き当たるのだから,人々にそれほどの先見の明を期待するのはどうやら無茶のようだ.きっと「計画−実装」方式は,我々の持つ限界により適した別のアプローチで置き換えられるのではないか.適切なツールがあるならば,プログラミングへの別のアプローチが可能だ.なぜ実装の前に計画を立てるのか?
プロジェクトの立案にどっぷり浸かり込むことの大きな危険性は,自らを袋小路に追い込んでしまう可能性がある点だ.もっと柔軟なプログラミング言語があれば,この心配を減らせるのでは?
そのとおり.そしてそういうプログラミング言語がある.Lispの柔軟性は全く新しいプログラミングのスタイルを生み出した.Lisp
においては,計画の大部分を立てるのはプログラムを書きながらでいい.なぜ後知恵が浮かぶのを待つのか?
モンテーニュ?1が気づいたように,考えを明確にするにはそれを書き下ろそうとすることが一番だ.自らを袋小路に追い込んでしまうとの心配からひとたび解放されれば,この可能性を最大限に活用できる.プログラムを書きながら計画を立てる能力は2つの重要な結果につながる:まず,プログラムを書くのにかかる時間が短くなる.計画を立てると同時にプログラムを書いていると,注意を集中すべきプログラムの実物を常に手にしていることになるからだ.そしてその方法で出来たプログラムはより良いものになるだろう.プログラムの最終デザインが常に進化の産物として出来上がるからだ.プログラムがあるべき姿を探している間に,一つの原則間違っていた部分を,見つけ次第その場で必ず書き直すを守る限り,最後に出来上がったものは,あらかじめ計画に数週間を費やした場合よりも優美なプログラムになるだろう.Lisp
が多目的なプログラミング言語だからこそ,この種のプログラミングが実用的な代替手段になる.事実 ,
Lisp の持つ最大の危険 はLisp がユーザを堕落させてしまうかもしれないことだ .
一度 Lisp をしばらく使うと , プログラミング言語とアプリケーションとの相性に敏感になりすぎ,元々使っていたプログラミング言語に戻っても,これでは必要な柔軟性が手に入らないという思いに常に囚われるようになりかねない.1.2 ボトムアッププログラミングプログラムの個々の機能的要素をあまり大きくしすぎてはならないというのが,プログラミングスタイルの長年の原則だ.プログラムの構成要素が,読めば理解できる状態を超えて肥大化するなら,それは複雑さの塊に成り果て,(大都市が流れ者を隠すように)簡単にエラーを覆い隠す.そういうソフトウェアは読みづらく,テストしづらく,デバッグしづらい.この原則に従い,大規模なプログラムは部品へと分割しなければいけない.またプログラムが大規模であればあるほど,さらに分割しなければいけない.プログラムを分割する方法とは何か?伝統的アプローチはトップダウンデザインと呼ばれる:「このプログラムの目的はこれらの7
個だから,プログラムを7 個の主要サブルーチンに分割することにする.1 個目のサブルーチンはこれら4 個のことを行わなければいけないから,それ自身のサブルーチンが今度は4 個になり , . . .
」といった具合だ.このプロセスはプログラム全体が適切な粒度すべての部分が意味のある仕事を行えるだけの大きさでありながら,単一のユニットとして理解できるくらい小さくなった状態になるまで続く.熟練Lispプログラマがプログラムを分割する方法は違っている.トップダウンデザインと同様,彼らには従う原則があり,それはボトムアップデザインプログラミング言語を問題に適するように変えていくと呼ばれる.Lispでは,プログラムをただプログラミング言語に従って書くことはしない.プログラミング言語を自分の書くプログラムに向けて構築するのだ.プログラムを書いているとき,
「 Lisp に○△のオペレータがあればなあ.」と思うことがあるかもしれない.そうしたらそれを書けばいい.後で,新しいオペレータの使用がプログラムの別の部分のデザインを簡潔にまとめることにつながったと気づくだろう.そういった感じでプログラミング言語とプログラムは共に進化する.交戦中の2 国間の国境のように,2 つの境界は何度も書き直される.それが落ち着くのは,山や川(ここではユーザの問題の持つ自然な境界)に辿り着いたときだ.最終的には,ユーザのプログラムではプログラミング言語がそのために設計されたかのような見かけになる.そしてプログラミング言語とプログラムが相性良く落ち着いたとき,ユーザは明快で小規模で効率的なコードを手にする.ボトムアップデザインは,同じプログラムをただ別の順番で書くだけのことではないということは,強調しておきたい.ボトムアップでプログラムを作ると,出来上がるものが違ってくるのだ.単一の一体となったプログラムではなく,より抽象的なオペレータを持つ大規模なプログラミング言語と,それで書かれた小規模なプログラムが出来るのだ.ユーザは戸口に重くかぶさるまぐさ石ではなく,弧を描いて高く立つアーチを手にする.典型的なコードでは,瑣末で定型的な処理を一度抽象化すると,残るものはずっと短い.プログラミング言語を高く構築すればするほど,トップから降りてくる道のりは短くなる.これはいくつかの長所をもたらす:1.
プログラミング言語に仕事を任せることで,ボトムアップデザインは小規模で機敏なプログラムを生む.短いプログラムは多数の構成要素に分割する必要がない.そして構成要素が少ないということは,プログラムが読みやすく修正しやすいものだということだ.また構成要素が少ないということは,構成要素同士の連結も少ないということなので,そこでエラーが起きる可能性も少ない.工業デザイナが機械の可動部分を減らそうと努力するのと同様に,熟練Lispプログラマはボトムアップデザインを使ってプログラムの大きさと複雑さを減らそうとする.2.
ボトムアップデザインはコードの再利用を促進する.プログラムを2 つ以上書くとき,最初のプログラムのために書いたユーティリティの多くは他のプログラムでも有用になる.ユーティリティの大規模な基盤を手にしてしまえば,新しいプログラムを書く手間は,
Lisp そのもので書かなければならないときにかかる手間の数分の一にすぎない.3 .
ボトムアップデザインはプログラムを読みやすくする.この種の抽象化に従ったものは,読む人に汎用オペレータを理解するよう要求する.それに対し機能の抽象化に従ったプログラムは,読む人に特定用途のサブルーチンを理解するよう要求する1.4.
ユーザにコード内のパターンに常に関心を払うようにさせる.ボトムアップでの作業はプログラムのデザインに関するアイディアを明確にするのに役立つ.一つのプログラムの中で種類の違う2 個の構成要素が形の上で似ているなら,類似性に気づくよう促されるし,おそらく単純な方法でプログラムをデザインし直すよう促されるだろう.ある程度までは,ボトムアップデザインはLisp 以外のプログラミング言語でも可能だ.ライブラリ関数を見ればそこには必ずボトムアップデザインの例がある.しかしLispはこの点に関してずっと幅広い力を与え,プログラミング言語がそれに見合った大きな役割をLisp のスタイルで演じるよう促すその役割があまり大きいので,
Lisp はただのプログラミング言語の一つではなく,全く違ったプログラミング方法になっている.このスタイルの開発は,小規模なグループによって書ける程度のプログラムに適しているというのは確かに真実だ.しかし同時に,このスタイルは小規模グループのなし得ることの限界を拡張する.Frederick
Brooks が『人月の神話 』( The Mythical Man-Month ) の中で示唆したのは , プログラマのグループの生産性はその規模に対して線形には増大しないということだった.グループのサイズが増大するにつれ,個々のプログラマの生産性は低下してゆく.Lisp
プログラミングの経験は , この法則のポジティブな捉え方を示唆している:グループのサイズが減少するにつれ,個々のプログラマの生産性は向上してゆくのだ.相対的に小規模なグループが勝利を収める.理由は単純,小さいから.小規模グループがLisp によって可能になるテクニックを活用するとき,完全な勝利が待っている.1 「でも君のユーティリティを全部理解しないことにはプログラムが読めなくなるじゃないか.」そういった言葉は大抵誤りだ.なぜかについては,4.8 節を参照.1.3拡張可能なソフトウェアLisp スタイルのプログラミングは,ソフトウェアが複雑さを増すにつれ重要性を増してきた.今時のユーザからのソフトウェアへの要求はあまりに多く,プログラマにはほとんど予想しきれない.ユーザ自身も要求のすべてを予想することができなくなっている.しかしユーザの望みを完璧に叶えるソフトウェアをプログラマが供給できなくとも,プログラマには拡張できるソフトウェアを供給することはできる.プログラマが自分のソフトウェアをただのプログラムからプログラミング言語に転換すれば,技術の高いユーザは必要な付加的機能をその上に作り上げられる.ボトムアップデザインは拡張可能なプログラムに自然につながっていく.ボトムアッププログラムの最も単純なものは,2
層から成る:プログラミング言語とプログラムだ.複雑なプログラムも一連の層として書き上げることができる.それぞれの層は1段下の層に対してプログラミング言語として機能する.この方針が最上層まで貫かれれば,その層がユーザの使うプログラミング言語となる.そのようなプログラムではあらゆるレベルで拡張が可能になっていて,伝統的なブラックボックスとして書かれ,後から拡張性を付け加えたシステムよりもはるかにいいプログラミング言語が出来上がることが多い.X
Windows とTEX はこの原則に基づくプログラムの古い例だ.1980 年代には高性能のハードウェアによってLisp を自らの拡張言語とする新世代のプログラムが可能になった.その最初は有名なUnix のテキストエディタ , GNU
Emacs だ.次は Autocad で, これ はLispを拡張言語とする大規模商用製品としては初になる.1991年にはInterleaf の新バージョンがリリースされたが,それはLisp を拡張言語に使っていただけではなく,かなりの部分がLisp で実装されていた .
Lisp は拡張可能なプログラムを書くためには素晴らしくいいプログラミング言語だ.それはLisp 自身が拡張可能なプログラムであるからだ.Lisp の拡張性をユーザにも渡すようなLisp プログラムを書けば,実質的には何もせずに拡張言語が出来たことになる.そしてLisp で Lisp プログラムを拡張することと,伝統的なプログラミング言語でそれを行うこととの違いは,誰かに直接会うことと手紙でやりとりすることとの違いのようなものだ.外部プログラムへのアクセス手段を提供するだけの拡張方法しか用意していないプログラムでは,あらかじめ決められたチャンネルを通じて連絡し合う2 つのブラックボックスになるにすぎない.Lisp では,拡張機能は背後にあるプログラム全体に直接アクセスできる.ユーザにプログラムのあらゆる部分へのアクセスを与えなければならないと言っている訳ではない.ただアクセスを与えるか与えないかをあなたが選べるということだ.このレベルのアクセスがインタラクティブな環境と結び付くと,最高の拡張性が得られる.自分のプログラムの拡張機能の基礎として使えるようなプログラムは,どれもかなり大規模になりがちだ.おそらく規模が大きすぎて全体的なイメージが掴めないほどだろう.何か不確かな点があるときどうなるだろう?
そのとき元のプログラムがLisp で書かれていれば,それをインタラクティブに調べることができる:データ構造を調査できる.関数を呼び出せる.ソースコードを読むことさえできる.この種のフィードバックにより,確かな自信を持ってプログラムを製作できる.思い切った拡張機能を書けるし,しかもそれが素早くできる.インタラクティブな環境は常にプログラミングを容易なものにしてくれるが,拡張機能を書いているときほどそれがありがたいときはない.拡張可能なプログラムは諸刃の剣だが,最近の経験によればユーザはただの剣より諸刃の剣のほうを好む.どんな危険性が備わっていようとも,拡張可能なプログラムのほうが勝るようだ.1.4
Lisp の拡 張Lispに新しいオペレータを加えるには2 通りの方法がある:関数とマクロだ.Lispではユーザの定義した関数は組み込み関数と同じ地位を占める.もしmapcar
の変種が新しく必要になったら,それを自分で定義し , mapcar を使うのと同じようにそれを使うことができる.例えば,ある関数が1から10 までの整数に適用されたときにそれが返す値のリストが必要なら,新しいリストを作ってそれをmapcar に渡すことができる :( mapcar fn
( do *
( (x 1 ( 1+ x ) )
( result ( list x ) ( push x result ) ) )
( (= x 10 ) ( nreverse result ) ) ) )

CANBERRA ( Reuters ) -
One of the largest giant squid ever found has washed up on a remote Australian beach , sparking a race against time by scientists to examine the rarely seen deep - ocean creature .
The squid , the mantle or main body of which measured two - meters ( 6.5 feet ) long , was found by a walker late on Tuesday on Ocean Beach , near Strahan , on the western coast of island state Tasmania .
“ It ’s a whopper , ” Tasmanian Museum senior curator Genefor Walker - Smith told local media on Wednesday .
“ The main mantle is about one meter across and its total length is about eight meters . ”
Scientists would take samples from the creature , identified by state parks officials as an Architeuthis , which can grow to more than 10 meters ( 33 feet ) in length and weigh more than 275 kilograms ( 606 pounds ) .
The Tasmanian animal was 250 kg , Pemberton said .
The tentacles had been badly damaged , so the overall length of the animal could not be determined , a Tasmania Parks and Wildlife spokeswoman said .
Park rangers had moved the remains from the water .
Giant squid , once believed to be mythical despite occasional sightings by mariners , feed on fish and other squid .
Last year , fishermen off the Falkland Islands caught a complete animal measuring 8.62 meters .
Scientists believe giant squid usually live at ocean depths of between 200- 700 meters ( 660 - 2,300 ft ) , relying in part on volleyball - sized eyes , the largest in the animal kingdom .
Scientists said giant squid gathered along Australia ’s continental shelf in cold mid-winter waters to feed on Grenadier fish .
The squid were in turn hunted by sperm whales migrating north from the Southern Ocean .
Japanese ocean researchers captured the first ever pictures of a live giant squid in September 2004 off Japan ’s Ogasawara Islands at a depth of 900 meters .
My brother Howard Wooldridge served as a decorated police officer and detective in Lansing , Michigan for 18 years .
During that time , he collared killers , drunk drivers , child molesters , rapists , wife beaters and drug dealers .
What he learned launched him on a crusade to stop the federal government ’s useless 35 year “ War on Drugs . ”
My brother stands so passionate about his cause that he rode his horse Misty 3,300 miles coast to coast across America in 2005 .
To gain attention , his sweat - stained T - shirt read , “ Cops Say Legalize Drugs : Ask Me Why . ”
The drug war costs American taxpayers $ 70 billion a year and over the past 35 years , costs approach a trillion dollars .
Result ?
Drugs remain CHEAPER and MORE available than 35 years ago .
“ The war on drugs , ” said Howard Wooldridge , one of the founders of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition at www.leap.cc.
“ How is that working for us in America ?
Is it reducing crime ?
Is it reducing rates of death and disease ?
Is it effective in keeping drugs and drug dealers away from our children ?
Is it making America safer and more prosperous ?
As my profession chases drugs , what are we missing ?
These are important questions as this prohibition approach costs us taxpayers some 70 billion dollars this year . ”
Wooldridge said , “ As a police officer , I fought on the side of the ‘ good guys ’ for 18 years in the “ War on Drugs , ” giving me ample actual experience in the trenches .
After much time , consternation and out - and - out frustration in not achieving a single , stated goal in the long term , I came to the conclusion that we must be doing something wrong .
It seemed no matter how many dealers we took off the streets , new ones immediately popped up to take their places .
The prices for drugs kept falling , indicating an oversupply .
The purity became better ; heroin increased from 3.6 percent to near 50 percent purity between 1980 and 2007 .
The prison population kept increasing until over 70 percent of all inmates are there on some drug - related charge .
The only thing we have to show for this terrible policy is that today after 36 years and a trillion tax dollars spent , illegal drugs are cheaper , stronger and very easy for our kids to buy . ”
In those 18 years , I listened to my brother Howard ’s frustrations each time we sat down for dinner .
He bemoaned the senselessness of the drug war .
The people within the department now work it to keep their jobs and nothing else .
The “ War on Drugs ” exists to exist .
“ Why has my profession been unable to make a dent ? ” Howard Wooldridge asked .
“ It has not been for lack of trying .
Thousands of police officers have been shot and hundreds killed .
We have arrested 36 million Americans for drug possession , use or sale .
First , understand that drug dealers accept as a condition of employment -- death and long prison terms .
We know there is an inexhaustible number of people who will risk death to make huge profits that prohibition generates .
A second major reason is that when someone buys an illegal drug from a dealer , nobody calls 911 to report the ‘ crime . ’
It is very difficult for us to catch suspects when the phone does not ring .
Neither the buyers nor the sellers see themselves as ‘ victims . ’
“ Drug gangs have spread like the plague out of the large cities and into medium and even small cities .
Young teens join gangs to make ‘ easy , ’ big money selling drugs .
Fifteen year olds are shot and killed every week because drug prohibition gives them this job option .
Many Hispanic members are the first generation of immigrants who do n’t want to work hard like their parents .
The role model in the barrio is the rich drug dealer , not the hard - working parent .
A policy which many say is to protect kids actually causes hundreds of deaths a year and tens of thousands of destroyed young lives . ”
For any curious Americans , MS - 13 gangs from El Salvador , now numbering 15,000 members , operate in 33 states according to a recent Newsweek report .
They recruit our kids with easy money .
Once in the gang , their lives stand at risk .
“ On our borders customs officers spend huge amounts of time looking for smuggled drugs which allows them less time for catching the millions who cross illegally , ” Howard Wooldridge said .
“ The Coast Guard is focused on drugs and not the ships which bring over many hundreds of illegals in ships .
In the century of 9/11 we should be focusing on threats to the nation and instead we are heavily engaged in a nearly four decade , failed policy of drug prohibition .
“ The unintended consequences of this terrible war are needlessly destroying the lives of generations of America 's youth .
How many people do you know who have used an illegal drug , then put the drugs behind them and gone on to lead productive lives ?
US presidents , many members of our legislative bodies , tens of thousands of police officers have done exactly that .
With imprisonment , those possibilities are eliminated .
You can get over an addiction , but you will never get over a conviction .
“ Now envision a world where all drugs sell in state - regulated stores , not on street corners by teens which gets them killed .
Imagine a world where the federal police focus on securing our borders from armed and unarmed invasion .
Envision a world where terrorists do n’t buy weapons from money made selling drugs .
Imagine a world where felony crime drops over 50 percent and local police focus on drunk drivers , child predators and terrorists .
Envision a world where if one day you or a loved one has a drug problem , you see a doctor not a judge .
America can have this world , if it repeals its laws of the New Prohibition . ”
Officer Howard J. Wooldridge ( retired ) , Education Specialist , Law Enforcement Against Prohibition ( www.leap.cc), Washington DC
The boards of both companies were set to hold separate meetings late Tuesday to ratify a definitive agreement , Faber said .
The accord would end months of wrangling among the Bancroft family , which controls Dow Jones .
Many members had opposed the $ 5 billion offer , which became public on May 1 , fearing Murdoch would interfere with the Journal 's editorial independence .
But monetary issues appeared to have caused many family members to switch their votes .
" They suddenly realized that if they were to turn down this deal , they would also be on the hook for paying all those fees to their advisers , " Faber said , including Merrill Lynch and the law firm of Wachtell Lipton .
" It adds up to a big number .
So they started to change their minds . "
Let 's try to have a broader look on the Natural Gas supply challenge that both Europe and North America face these days , with the help of Jean Laherrère .
Jean Laherrère presented an article entitled " Oil and Gas : what future ? " at the Groningen annual Energy Convention , a few days ago .
This article is available , as usual , at Jean 's space in OilCrisis.com .
On the first half of the article Jean goes through the usual assessment of Discovery , Reserves and Production for Conventional Oil showing the same results as in previous papers , resulting of the merging of two major data bases : IHS Energy 's and Wood Mackenzie's .
In this latest paper he goes on and does the similar concerning Natural Gas .
Jean Laherrère 's work is really priceless , in fact he has the data ( which most of us has n't ) but he really knows what information to get out of it , producing excellent easy to read graphs .
Reserves
Jean explains that for Natural Gas the assessment of remaining reserves is more difficult , for both data bases concern different domains : Wood Mackenzie reports solely recoverable gas reserves whilst IHS Energy reports considerable amounts of stranded gas .
Although not as reliable as oil data , the data for gas already yields a clear downward trend :
The peak in Natural Gas remaining reserves was crossed in the late 1980s ( circa 6000 Tcf ) , just ten years after Conventional Oil .
The cross point with political reserves happened in the turn of the century , equally ten years after the same event for Conventional Oil .
This ten year lag is very interesting for it shows the same pattern of political under- reporting followed by over - reporting registered for Conventional Oil .
The same story , happening ten years later .
Discovery
Modelling discovery is also harder , for in 1971 the North Dome gas field was found in the Persian Gulf ( shared by Iran and Qatar ) , totaling circa 1500 Tcf ( or 15 % of the Ultimate ) .
So Jean took this field out and adjusted a logistic curve to the remaining Cumulative Discovery , which fitted pretty good , and added back North Dome .
Modeling it this way the logistic points to an Ultimate over 9000 Tcf ; Jean indicates that this number is line with previous assessments that pointed to an Ultimate circa 10 000 Tcf .
Production
To forecast future production Jean added a cycle for Unconventional Gas , with an Ultimate of 2000 Tcf , and two for Conventional Gas : an early one with an Ultimate of 500 Tcf and a peak circa 1980 and another with an Ultimate of 9500 Tcf and a peak circa 2025 .
At peak production , All Gas ( Conventional + Unconventional ) will go over 140 Tcf/y , from the current 97 Tcf/y , an increase of 45 % in little more than 20 years .
Still , numbers from the IEA or EIA already disagree largely from this assessment , showing that neither of these two institutions is using logistic modeling techniques .
So far so good , right ?
Wrong .
As probably most of TOD readers know , there 's no such thing as a World Natural Gas Market , meaning that geographic regions unconnected with gas pipelines must be assessed separately .
So does Jean .
North America
This is when things start looking grim .
Production is neatly mirroring Discovery with a 23 year lag .
This contrasts to Conventional
Oil where the production curve does n't mimic the discovery the same way .
While Conventional Oil production at peak will be around 75 Mb/d , the discovery peak went over 120 Mb/d. Natural Gas Production looks like a smoothed version of Discovery , less noisy , but with the same background trends at the same yearly ratios .
Simply put , by 2010 Conventional Gas production can be half of what is today in North America , falling from 20 Tcf / a to 10 Tcf / a .
Jean does n't hesitate to say that shortages will soon occur in this part of the world .
Production already peaked in 2001 , declining 5 % up to 2005 , so a downward trend is already there , but will that cliff unfold ?
Unconventional Gas production has been rising too slowly to avoid the peak , can it avoid the cliff ?
Europe
Europe is yet to go over the peak , and up to now , good neighbours ( Algeria and Russia ) have been helping sending all the gas asked for .
Europe will shortly face its dependency ; modeling production with an Ultimate of 750 Tcf , Jean shows this graph :
Consumption has been growing at a much sharper pace than Production , which to make matters worse is going into decline .
More good neighbours please .
FSU
Last but not least Jean looks into production in the FSU , the big neighbour .
Jean 's estimate for the FSU 's Ultimate is 2000 Tcf which means a production peak before 2020 .
Moreover , in spite of a growth up to a production rate of 35 Tcf/y , internal demand will leave by then a meager 10 Tcf /y to export .
Finally Jean casts doubts on the will of Gazprom to make the investments needed to ramp up production in the years to follow .
The Importance of Gas
From Jean 's work we get to know that both wealthy sides of the Atlantic are heading for trouble .
With Peak Oil in site , all we needed was an even sooner Gas Peak .
Let 's have a look at what Gas means to our daily life .
First of all Gas is a much more effective way to generate heat at home than using electricity or oil products .
Electricity is partially generated from Gas ; there are losses in transport and losses in transforming electricity into heat .
From
Oil we have the overheads of transport and refinement .
With Gas we just have a little overhead in transport ; there are nearly zero losses and no refining .
Secondly Gas is today the best energy source we have to tackle the daily periodic variations in electricity demand .
Whilst Coal and Nuclear provide the base energy , they do not allow for the sharp variations in output required when folks start to wake up or when they arrive from work and turn on all of their electronic gadgetry .
Take the following graph , showing the supply and demand put to the Portuguese electric grid on a sample period of two days last Spring :
Electricity Demand and Supply on two sample days in Portugal .
Red - Coal , light blue - Small Hydro , white - Gas , dark blue - Big Hydro , green - Other Renewable , yellow - Imported ( Nuclear ) , magenta - Diesel Oil , thick black line - Demand .
The electricity generated from Coal keeps quite steady during the course of the day , while Hydro and Gas provide the agility needed to accommodate the variations .
During the night cheap Nuclear energy is imported to fill the dams that discharge during the day .
Hydroelectric generation is not always possible like this , during the Summer minimum flow has to be maintained and during the Winter maximum flow cannot be surpassed .
So the real agility comes from Gas .
The use of Diesel Oil is also possible , recurred to on crisis periods where available Gas is n't enough and direct electricity imports are impossible ( such was the case in the morning of the first day ) .
As seen above heat generation from Gas is potentially more effective than from Oil products , making it a cheaper way to generate electricity .
When the Diesel power plants are turned on it means that the immediate generating capacity is close to full .
These periods are , to my knowledge , still rare .
Portugal is probably different from the majority of the other OECD countries , but an interesting case , for every major energy source is used for generating electricity .
Mitigation
Options are n't many ; the imminence of the subject makes it hardly solvable with new infrastructure : new pipelines from distant suppliers , new power plants using different sources of energy , more LNG terminal ports and more LNG tankers ; they all take time to come on line .
This side of the issue has been extensively covered at TOD ( here , here , here or here ) .
We need a gaseous inflammable substance to use in our power plants and to send through the pipelines to our homes .
That can be obtained by Coal gasification - what was formerly known as Town Gas .
But this option might stump into constraints in the Coal industry , Town Gas might only be the translation of the infrastructure constraints from Gas transport to Coal mining ( and gasification ) .
Still there is some electricity generation capacity from Oil , but it is unlikely that either Europe or North America will be able grow imports much more from what they are now .
And of course , for home heating Oil does n't help much .
The only mitigation option left is Conservation , will it be enough ?

Cindy Sheehan announces she 'll run against Nancy Pelosi Nick Juliano and Michael Roston
Published : Monday July 23 , 2007 Print This Email This Anti-Iraq War activist Cindy Sheehan announced in Washington on Monday afternoon that she would challenge Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the 2008 Congressional election .
" The Democrats will not hold this administration accountable so we have to hold them accountable , and I for one will step up to the plate and run against Nancy Pelosi , " Sheehan told a cheering crowd outside Rep. John Conyers ' office on Capitol Hill .
Sheehan brought a petition calling for the impeachment of President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney to Conyers , D - Mich . , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee .
Pro-impeachment organizers gathered more than 1 million signatures for the petition , Sheehan said .
Sheehan and other activists meet with Conyers in his office for nearly two hours .
Conyers told them there were not enough votes to impeach the President or Vice President , and so he did not intend to hold hearings on the impeachment resolution introduced by Rep.
Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio , Sheehan said , eliciting loud boos from the hundreds of people gathered outside .
Kucinich 's Articles target the Vice President .
" We expressed what we feel is the urgency of removing George Bush and Dick Cheney from office , " Sheehan told the crowd .
She said their impeachment was " the only thing that can save our country and our soldiers " by brining the war in Iraq to an end .
A spokesperson for the Congressman would not confirm the details of the meeting with RAW STORY .
The anti-war activist , who became prominent after initiating peace vigils near President Bush 's Crawford , Texas ranch , then conducted a sit - in at Conyers ' congressional office , where she was later arrested by Capitol police .
Between 20 and 30 people were carted off by Capitol police after they refused to clear Conyers ' office and the hallway outside .
" Everybody , this is a police action now , " a Capitol police officer told the protesters .
The officer told RAW STORY that the protesters would be charged with unlawful assembly or similar charges .
Sheehan and a group of 300 or so supporters marched to Capitol Hill from the Arlington National Cemetery .
Sheehan is the mother of Casey Sheehan , an Army Specialist who was killed in the Iraq War .
The activists came to Washington from across the country to make their voices heard in favor of impeachment .
Even if the protest does n't change many minds , it is important to speak up for one 's beliefs , some of the activists told RAW STORY .
" I felt strongly about what Vietnam was doing to this country , and this time around , I want to be a little more involved than last time , " Ken Jones , a 58 - year - old protester , told RAW STORY .
Jones traveled to Washington from Pennsylvania to participate in what was his first pro-impeachment demonstration .
Daily Kos diarist Bob Fertik offered further details of the Conyers - Sheehan showdown .
While Sheehan has considerably greater national prominence , she would not be the first progressive candidate to challenge Pelosi .
In the 2006 Congressional election , Pelosi faced Green Party candidate Krissy Keefer , who received 8 % of the vote in Pelosi's San Francisco district .
The Speaker received 80 % of the vote .
Sheehan and her supporters hope her decision to challenge Pelosi inspires other progressive citizens to challenge their elected representatives in the 2008 elections .
" We need citizens that are n't beholden to corporations , " Tina Richards , CEO of Grassroots America and a Sheehan supporter , told RAW STORY , " people that wo n't allow their government to have preemptive wars . "

Was Pat Tillman Murdered ?
Absolutely Yes , According to a Nam Vet
by Bill Perry
I ’m NOT looking for an argument here , on what Wes Clark may , or may NOT have said on Keith Olberman ’s MSNBC show .
What I DO want to mention is my highly personal experience of killing 4 men at extremely close range , with an M - 16 .
The Doctors examining Pat Tillman stated there was “ an extremely close shot group “ …. ( and they added “ fired from less than 10 yards ” away ) .
I ’m an expert marksman , and I killed 4 men who ran right up on my point position , AFTER an ambush began , them not realizing I was so far removed from the other 28 men in my platoon .
These men were about 3 to 4 yards away , and I had excellent cover …
I had probably killed all 4 of them with just my first 6 shots from the expended 19 round magazine … and I went through their pockets , afterwards , while they were still warm .
There was NOTHING CLOSE to a “ Shot group ” on any of these men .
Their wounds reflected their flailing & flying bodies as I blew them away .
A “ Shot group ” on Pat Tillman ’s forehead indicates ONE shot killed him , and then he was “ double checked ” , then “ triple checked ” at POINT BLANK range , to make sure he was dead .
( 3 shots = “ Shot Group ” )

By Imogen Foulkes
BBC Geneva correspondent
Moving house is said to be one of life 's most stressful experiences but , in Switzerland , it is made even more stressful by strict requirements on how you leave your old home .
Imogen Foulkes moved house recently and describes the day the hygiene inspector came to call .
I have to confess , I have always been a bit intimidated by the Swiss devotion to cleanliness .
Women in Switzerland spend a couple of hours a day cleaning the house
I found myself sitting in a kitchen which seemed more suited to open heart surgery than a cosy chat about feeding routines and nappy rash .
The surfaces gleamed , the floor was spotless , even the babies were squeaky clean - apart from mine , who was only squeaky .
Immaculate
But , a few years on , I have become more used to Swiss hygiene standards so , when it came to moving house , I knew I was expected to leave my old home immaculate .
Sure enough , I got a letter saying the hygiene inspector would be there at 10 o'clock on a Monday morning .
Too late , I realised I could not actually remember having cleaned that drawer
His name was Herr Schweizer - or Mr Swiss in English - and he had even brought a spare pair of shoes to wear inside the house .
I should have recognised the warning signs when I noticed that Herr Schweizer , who was no taller than me , somehow managed to look down at me over the top of his glasses .
Inspection
But I had spent the best part of three days cleaning and I was confident I would pass the inspection with flying colours .
The streets of Geneva are spotless
The oven shone , the cupboards were bare .
But Herr Schweizer was not impressed .
He was too busy unscrewing my taps .
" Look " , he said pointing to the inside of a pipe I 'd scarcely known existed .
" All these calcium deposits , you 'll have to get rid of them . "
We moved on to the ceramic hob .
Mr Swiss bent over it .
I could see his reflection in its pristine surface - he could see something else .
Black speck
He produced a razor blade from his pocket and scraped gently - a tiny black speck floated upwards .
" Still dirty " , he said .
The list grew ever longer and I realised I had at least another day 's cleaning ahead of me
Too late , I realised I could not actually remember having cleaned that one .
Herr Schweizer pulled it open to reveal three old fish knives , a cork , two bottle openers and what looked suspiciously like a lock of child 's hair .
This time he said nothing .
He just sighed and added the drawer to his list .
On it went .
Behind a radiator he discovered half a spider 's web .
In the bathroom , dismantling the toilet cistern revealed yet more calcium deposits .
Downstairs in the cellar , the ventilation shaft was smudged .
Scrubbing and polishing
The list grew ever longer and I realised I had at least another day 's cleaning ahead of me .
It gave me a chance , during the scrubbing and polishing , to reflect on why it is the Swiss attach so much importance to cleanliness .
Passing the fuse box , he pulled it open .
" Look " , he said triumphantly .
" Dust ! "
Another friend , more unkindly , suggests that the Swiss are not exactly noted for their achievements in art and literature - perhaps , he says , because they pour their creative energy into cleaning .
My own interpretation has to do with the role of women in Swiss society - those with children often do not work .
That means hundreds of thousands of women in small apartments , with no gardens and time on their hands .
A recent survey revealed that the average Swiss woman can spend at least two hours - every day - on housework .
Ordeal
The very idea exhausts me , but it probably saves them the ordeal I went through at Mr Schweizer 's hands .
When the inspection ended , I was given a six - page list of improvements I needed to make and , as I ushered him towards the door , he had one last instruction .
Passing the fuse box , he pulled it open .
" Look " , he said triumphantly .
" Dust ! "
A week later , the house is clean , my muscles ache and my hands are sore from cleaning fluids .
But I 'm happy , because I know that should a pair of heart surgeons move into my old house , they need never go to the hospital - they can perform operations in my kitchen , and store their instruments in my fuse box .

Those who read city blogs like BlogTO and various urban - minded Flickr feeds may have seen photos of a series of official looking signs around town that warn good Torontonians of homeless conditions nearby .
Are they official ?
Is Toronto even more progressive than we thought ?
It turns out they are the work of Mark Daye , a 4th year graphic design student at OCAD .
Instead of rebranding a product , or service for my 4th year thesis project I chose to represent a local population that usually gets overlooked .
I re-coded official signage and affixed 30 of them to poles in the downtown core with messages pertaining to an obvious but ignored urban sub culture .
The goal was not only to catch people off guard by creating signs that acknowledge the homeless population on a seemingly official level , but to get people to think about codes of behaviour , conformity , acceptance and to maybe spare some consideration for the homeless who live mostly ignored in the city , blending into the background just like the signs .
Daye went on to say that the amount of feedback he ’s got from the sign project has been good , and that “ If I have learned anything it ’s that Toronto has a lot of interested people who actively look at the city , not just travel through it ” .

Software engineering is different .
Software engineering is different because only the best people significantly contribute to achievement .
Traditional management texts assume a distribution of talent among the workers .
Each worker is contributing something useful and the challenge is to get each one to perform at his or her maximum potential .
In the same factory , the best worker may produce two or three times as much as the average , but all the workers are contributing .
In software engineering a good programmer is at least 10 times more productive than an average programmer ( Brooks 1995 ) .
If a product is being developed rapidly , the average programmers will consume nearly their entire work day just in reading and understanding the new code generated by the good programmers .
Thus the challenges of a software engineering manager first and foremost are ( 1 ) creating a work environment where good programmers will be satisfied enough to stay , and ( 2 ) creating a system via which average programmers can become good .
In an ideal software engineering organization , there are still some average - quality people but these should be viewed as being apprenticed to the best people and being taught as fast as possible .
Software engineering is different because people at all levels of the organization perceive themselves to be equally intelligent .
Consensus - style management can perhaps work when there is a gradient of perceived ability .
Given enough time , the less able workers will follow the lead of the more able workers .
One of the paradoxes of software engineering is that people with bad ideas and low productivity often think of themselves as supremely capable .
They are the last people whom one can expect to fall in line with a good strategy developed by someone else .
As for the good programmers who are in fact supremely capable , there is no reason to expect consensus to form among them .
Each programmer thinks his or her idea about what to build and how to build it is the best .
( See Kruger and Dunning 's " Unskilled and Unaware of It : How Difficulties in Recognizing One 's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self - Assessments " for more on this topic . )
Software engineering is different because a leaf - node worker is more expert than any manager , even when the manager is a great engineer , in at least the small portion of the system that the leaf - node worker has personally built .
This makes it difficult for a manager to engage in a technical argument with a worker .
It becomes nearly impossible when the manager 's technical skills are weak .
The worker can spin castles of complexity in the air and come up with impressive - to - the - MBA excuses for why it has to be done a certain way or on a certain schedule .
Software engineering is different because the organization can't afford to lose the individual productivity of the best people by pushing them into management .
A truly great programmer may generate 10 times as much business value as a merely good programmer .
Can the organization afford to take someone who can do the work of 100 average programmers and push him or her into a pure management role ?
Probably not .
Can the organization afford to put people with weak technical skills into management roles ?
Probably not .
Once you give Joe MBA a title and ask him to coordinate eventually he will be making decisions that have engineering implications .
Thus many of the best programmers are eventually forced at least to assume project leadership and mentoring responsibilites .
Since they are still expected to produce designs , software , documentation , and journal articles , the danger is that the new manager will become glued to his or her screen and never look up to see how the project team is doing .
Software engineering is different because measurement is notoriously difficult .
The world is full of products that failed due to overly complex and tasteless designs .
Yet all of these designs were considered tasteful by their architects .
Systems that experts evaluated and found wanting , such as the Unix operating system ( 1970 ) , eventually proved to have great utility .
It is a bit easier to count up the lines of code per day produced by a programmer but if the project was not very tightly specified originally , how do you know whether or not these lines of code are useful ?
At this point a skeptical reader might be thinking that , while software engineering is different from line production work or any other endeavor with a manufacturing division of labor , there are similarities with research and development , management consulting , and financial analysis .
This is certainly true but there are n't too many interesting books on how to reliably produce results in these fields ( one is referenced in the " More " section below ) .
Ideas to Steal
people do n't do what they are told
all performers get the right consequences every day
small , immediate , certain consequences are better than large future uncertain ones
positive reinforcement is more effective than negative reinforcement
ownership leads to high productivity
people do n't do what they are told
Bringing out the Best in People
A corollary to this principle is that people do what you reward them to do , not what you hope they will do .
Often , when you look at what is truly rewarded in an organization , you find it is different than what you think is rewarded .
Do the managers have an engineering background ?
If not , they 'll probably be unable to perceive when a programmer is accomplishing nothing .
So the programmer who does nothing gets a paycheck at the end of the month .
Having thus been rewarded for doing nothing , the programmer tries it again the next month ...
all performers get the right consequences every day
small , immediate , certain consequences are better than large , future , uncertain ones
positive reinforcement is more effective than negative reinforcement
We thus proved the management adage that a deadline just gives someone an excuse to procrastinate and do nothing until the very end .
Graduate school at MIT is different .
We want the students to do research , write up their results , publish them in journals , and graduate with a reasonably interesting PhD thesis .
If a student finishes some research , the most effective faculty advisors immediately provide positive reinforcement by paying attention , helping design the next experiment , helping to draft a paper outline .
If the student finishes a write - up , he or she is positively reinforced by being sent to a conference to present it .
If the student finishes a PhD thesis , he or she is positively reinforced by being given a 3 - 7X pay raise .
The lesson from MIT ?
Negative reinforcement can work if the organization is extremely tightly managed , if the consequences are small and immediate ( usually a problem set is due every week and only represents a part of the final grade ) , and if the goal is to make sure that everyone comes up to a reasonable level .
However , the worldwide fame of MIT rests on research achievements by graduate students .
This innovation is mostly supported by positive reinforcement .
ownership leads to high productivity
As an example , in the early days of ArsDigita we had only a handful of customers : America Online , Environmental Defense Fund , Hewlett - Packard , Levi Strauss , Oracle Corporation , and Siemens .
We had only a handful of programmers as well and hence the easiest way to divide the work was to give a programmer total responsibility for one project .
The programmer owned that customer .
If the project went well and the customer wrote us a big check , we gave nearly all of the money directly to the programmer .
If any project had gone poorly and we'd been fired by a customer , we would not have had to think very hard to figure out who was responsible ( fortunately this never happened while I was running the company ! ) .
People worked insanely hard to make their projects successful and their clients happy .
More importantly , the programmer who did an entire project by him or herself learned enough to train new people , lead a larger project , etc .
After we grew beyond the 40 - person mark , pressures to dilute the ownership aspects of our organization grew .
We wanted to grow rapidly - - nobody wants to buy enterprise software from a small company , even if the software happens to be open source .
As our reputation grew , customers came to us with larger projects .
We believed that many of our developers were too junior to handle complete responsibility for these large projects .
Our costs went up because we had to coordinate the diffused responsibility .
In the summer of 2000 , when we had 200 or so employees , one of our clients was unhappy .
It took a week just to arrange a meeting among the five managers who bore collective responsibility for the project !
Meanwhile , individual productivity fell .
It was taking more programmer - months and more calendar months to get things done .
On weekend mornings you could walk naked through an entire floor of our headquarters building without fear of embarrassment .
( At the time of this writing , there is a proposal on the table to consolidate some of the separate management pyramids , thus taking us back closer to our original structure . )
Building and keeping a good software engineering team
What attracts good programmers ?
Traditionally the best programmers seek the most challenging problems .
They want to work in an organization that is trying to build something important .
Programmers have huge and fragile egos .
If they are somehow assigned to a trivial problem and that is their only possible task , they may spend six months coming up with a bewildering architecture more complex than the Windows 2000 operating system , merely so that they can show their friends and colleagues what a tough nut they are trying to crack .
Another source of ego - gratification for programmers is to have other programmers admiring their work .
Open - source software projects thus have a big recruiting advantage over closed - source software companies .
What kind of working environment is necessary for programmer satisfaction ?
Good programmers want to achieve and therefore removing barriers to achievement is the most important step that one can take in creating an effective working environment .
Programmers dread elaborate process , endless meetings , and layers of marketing approval before a product can be shipped .
Ideally it would be possible to conceive a product on Friday evening , set up the development environment Friday night , write code on Saturday and Sunday , test on Sunday night , and ship on Monday morning .
Maintaining this kind of freedom is a serious challenge as a company grows and its products become more complex .
Successful companies such as Oracle Corporation burden their marketing departments with overlapping products rather than stifle programmer initiative .
For example , during most of the late 1990s there were at least three different Web servers that you could buy from Oracle , each one backed up by a document explaining why it was the one true path toward database - backed Web site glory .
A good physical working environment is essential .
Great programmers get a lot of positive reinforcement from their work itself .
They write some code and immediately can see it dance .
That keeps them at work for hours that , while they would not impress a taxi driver in Singapore or a factory worker in Guangzhou , will surprise many American business people .
When we hired an architect to lay out the interior of ArsDigita 's first building in Cambridge he surveyed the programmers and came back shaking his head : " I 've never seen any group of people who spend so many hours continuously sitting at their desks . "
From a business point of view , long hours by programmers are a key to profitability .
Suppose that a programmer needs to spend 25 hours per week keeping current with new technology , getting coordinated with other programmers , contributing to documentation and thought leadership pieces , and comprehending the structures of the systems being extended .
Under this assumption , a programmer who works 55 hours per week will produce twice as much code as one who works 40 hours per week .
In The Mythical Man-Month , the only great book ever written on software engineering , Fred Brooks concludes that no software product should be designed by more than two people .
He argues that a program designed by more than two people might be more complete but it will never be easy to understand because it will not be as consistent as something designed by fewer people .
This means that if you want to follow the best practices of the industry in terms of design and architecture , the only way to improve speed to market is to have the same people working longer hours .
Finally there is the common sense notion that the smaller the team the less management overhead .
A product is going to get out the door much faster if it is built by 4 people working 70 - hour weeks ( 180 productive programmer - hours per week , after subtracting for 25 hours of coordination and structure comprehension time ) than if by 12 people working 40 - hour weeks ( the same net of 180 hours per week ) .
The 12 - person team will inevitably require additional managers and all - day meetings to stay coordinated .
Your business success will depend on the extent to which programmers essentially live at your office .
For this to be a common choice , your office had better be nicer than the average programmer 's home .
There are two ways to achieve this result .
One is to hire programmers who live in extremely shabby apartments .
The other is to create a nice office .
Microsoft understands this .
In the early 1990s they did radio spots with John Cleese as a spokesman .
One of the main points of the ad was to ridicule the cheap open - plan offices in which programmers were traditionally housed and promote the fact that at Microsoft each developer gets a plush personal office .
How can an office be nicer than one 's home ?
Let 's consider the following dimensions :
social
physical comfort
aesthetic
entertainment
attractive
Social
A social place will never be friendly if it is trapped behind a high wall of security .
It ought to be very easy for a programmer to invite a friend over .
If programmers are comfortable meeting their friends at the office it greatly increases the likelihood of friends recruiting friends .
An open office plan contributes to making the work environment stronger on the social dimension .
Physical Comfort
One horrible mistake that we made was letting our architect design the workstations .
Each programmer was given a 6 ' x2 ' desk , 12 square feet total .
Two 21 " monitors took up so much depth that there was n't even room for a keyboard .
Immediately we had to toss our monitors and get flat panels ( cost about $ 400,000 extra ) .
IBM had a better architect for its Santa Theresa facility : Gerald McCue .
He found that each worker needed 100 square feet of dedicated space and 30 square feet of work surface .
McCue also found that programmers needed noise isolation from enclosed offices or high partitions but personally we think this rule is worth breaking in a dotcom world where a team has to work fast and in sync .
Better to manage noise by spreading desks apart a bit so that there are fewer programmers in a given area and therefore fewer conversations , fewer telephones , and more opportunities for sound to be absorbed before reaching someone 's ear .
Aesthetic
Entertainment
The average home cannot accomodate a pinball machine .
An office can .
The average home can have video games , which are very popular with young programmers , but not people with whom to play .
The average home cannot have a grand piano but almost any office can .
Attractive
dog - friendly policy
grand piano
climbing wall
indoor garden
aquarium
koi pond
exercise room with fancy machines
pinball machine
Change of Venue
What does it take to let the entire team pick up and work somewhere else for awhile ?
A beach house or a ski house within a two - hour drive of their main office .
It is kind of expensive for an individual to rent a vacation house year - around , equip it with a DSL line or cable modem , and pack it with enough desks and computers for a team to work .
But if you 've got a group of 30 programmers and get a house large enough for 6 or so to sleep and work , the cost is manageable .
In the winter , a programming team can disappear for a week , ski every morning and work all afternoon and evening .
In the summer , a team can spend a week looking out at the ocean ... while typing most of the time .
It costs more than not having the beach house but a lot less than having employees go off on their own to have fun every weekend and not work .
Turning average programmers into good programmers
How does one create a good programmer ?
Raw materials are important .
You want someone with a strong computer science education , a high IQ , and an ability to communicate effectively in oral presentations and in writing .
But without the right experience , such a person will never be more than an average quality programmer .
These principles are important in building up someone 's programming skills :
A person wo n't become proficient at something until he or she has done it many times .
In other words . , if you want someone to be really good at building a software system , he or she will have to have built 10 or more systems of that type .
A person wo n't retain proficiency at a task unless he or she has at one time learned to perform that task very rapidly .
Learning research demonstrates that the skills of people who become accurate but not fast deteriorate much sooner than the skills of people who become both accurate and fast .
Technology shifts force a programmer to go through bursts of learning every year or two .
Learning to design and build software systems requires that the programmer design and build software systems .
These can be smaller subprojects for internal or external customers , standalone software system for non-profit organizations , or demonstration systems to be written up and distributed to other programmers .
A particularly effective option that is only available in the Web world is to build and launch a free public service .
See http://remindme.arsdigita.com and http://towzone.arsdigita.com for examples of one - evening training projects .
Whatever the training task , the pace must be ruthlessly brisk .
The learner should be expected to build at the same pace as an experienced developer .
The difference between the learner and the wizard is that you expect the learner to make a lot of mistakes .
The system as built may be awkward or not handle error cases properly .
That 's okay .
Training research shows that if you get speed now you can get quality later .
But if you do n't get speed you will never get quality in the long run .
We practice this technique in 6.916 , Software Engineering for Web Applications , our course at MIT .
Each student builds five database - backed Web applications during the 13 - week semester .
The first few that they build , during the course of the problem sets , are not necessarily elegant or optimal , but by the end of the semester they 've become remarkably proficient , especially when you consider that each student is taking three or four other classes .
If you see one of your best people walking out the door at 6:00 pm , try to think why you have n't challenged that person with an interesting project .
If you see one of your average programmers walking out the door at 6:00 pm , recognize that this person is not developing into a good programmer .
An average programmer 's productivity will never be significant in a group of good programmers .
If you care about profits , you must either come up with a new training program for the person or figure out the best way to terminate his or her employment with your organization .
Still not convinced ?
Take a look at the Japanese " code factory " circa 1990 .
These precisely organized large organizations where each person had his role , however small , were supposed to overtake the American approach where small teams of craftsmen worked in a comparatively disorganized manner .
The factory approach sometimes produces acceptable corporate IT solutions but for innovation and successful product development , the craft approach has been overwhelmingly vindicated .
Turning good programmers into good managers
The classic problem situation at ArsDigita is a manager getting lost in his or her own work and failing to review a subordinate 's efforts for two or three months .
When the review occurs , inevitably the subordinate has either been working on the wrong thing in the wrong way or has n't been sufficiently productive .
At this point the manager is really angry .
Three months of calendar time and money have been wasted .
But should the manager be angry with the employee ?
If the manager had reviewed the subordinate every week , the company would never have been at risk of losing more than one week of time and money .
Our solution is to decouple responsibility for review from responsibility for scheduling review .
We use administrative assistants to ensure that each manager is scheduled to look at every subordinate 's work at least once per week , more frequently in the case of junior employees .
It has proven remarkably more effective when a neutral third - party is responsible for scheduling than when people with incentives to shirk are responsible for scheduling .
Management by Consensus Considered Harmful
Software engineering companies will tend to have a fairly flat distribution of intelligence .
The 22 - year - old Stanford CS punk that was just hired will be just as smart as the 30 - year - old lead engineer who will be just as smart as the 40 - year - old CEO .
Within a company 's technical team , the raw IQ differences are even smaller .
If each member of the team were playing the Bach Partitas and Sonatas for Solo Violin , the wrong notes , shaky intonation , and bad phrasing would make it pretty obvious to the novices that they needed to take advice from the experts .
But because software quality is tough to measure and software quantity is seldom measured , the novices in a software engineering group are able to think of themselves as experts .
What would be wrong with a completely egalitarian software engineering group ?
Maybe the entire team really is at the same level of ability .
And suppose that somehow the challenge of getting everyone to attack the same problem had been surmounted .
Remember what Fred Brooks said in The Mythical Man-Month : high quality systems must be architected by no more than two people .
Getting design input from leaf - node engineers is important for having a good product design .
But at the end of the day nobody should be confused as to who is providing leadership .
There is an irreducible amount of Engineer A imposing his or her design on Engineer B .
This can lead to some harsh - sounding words and bruised feelings .
Microsoft is not the self - esteem company , at least if you believe Playboy magazine 's interview with Bill Gates : " We hear you 're brusque at times , that you wo n't hesitate to tell someone their idea is the stupidest thing you 've ever heard .
It 's been called management by embarrassment challenging employees and even leaving some in tears . "
Truly elite organizations can be far worse than Microsoft .
Ask a group of surgical interns and residents how much respect they get from the surgeons .
Go into a world - class biology department and ask the grad students and post - docs about their treatment at the hands of the professors .
Wherever You Go , There You Are
Consider the average working programmer 's life :
surfing USENET
surfing Slashdot
reading docs
questioning colleagues
writing specs and designs
writing docs
writing code
testing code
fixing bugs
filing bug reports on others ' code
attending meetings
helping sales and marketing staff
( For comparison to the grad student life , see http://philip.greenspun.com/humor/graduate-student-emotion-check-list.)
Characterizing this person 's productivity is going to require more than one number .
But if we do n't do it , days or weeks could slip by without the programmer realizing that his or her achievement levels are plummeting .
In a company with disorganized or technically clueless managers , the programmer 's supervisory chain wo n't notice the lack of achievement either .
Production of documentation and code is generally measurable by reference to the company 's version control system .
Bugs filed and fixed are easily tallied by looking at the company 's ticket / bug tracking system ( see http://www.arsdigita.com/doc/ticket for a description of our favorite open - source ticket / bug tracker ) .
The softer stuff can still be quantified but it will have to be done by humans filling out forms .
Ideally the programmer will get daily feedback , which is kept private unless the individual elects to publicize it .
Performance in each sanctioned area of activity will be marked up and scored with a weight .
The programmer can then see if his or her crude achievement level is going up or down .
Summary
Start by attracting a good core team , perhaps by setting up an organization that enables each engineer to excel along the axes defined in http://philip.greenspun.com/ancient-history/professionalism-for-software-engineers.
Provide a productive working environment and a physical environment that is better than the average programmer 's house .
Provide daily positive reinforcement .
Provide daily feedback showing the programmer more or less exactly what he or she has accomplished , plus a graph for the preceding few months showing the trend .
Aim to install a feeling of ownership in each worker .

EVEN the greatest empires hurt when they lose wars .
It is not surprising then that Iraq weighs so heavily on the American psyche .
Most Americans want to get out as soon as possible , surge or no surge ; many more wish they had never invaded the country in the first place .
But for a growing number of Americans the superpower 's inability to impose its will on Mesopotamia is symptomatic of a deeper malaise .
Nearly six years after September 11th , nervousness about the state of America 's “ hard power ” is growing ( see article ) .
Iraq and Afghanistan ( another far - off place where the United States , short of troops and allies , may be losing a war ) have stretched the Pentagon 's resources .
An army designed to have 17 brigades on active deployment now has 25 in the field .
Despite bringing in reservists and the National Guard , many American troops spend more than half their time on active duty ; the British spend a fifth .
Other demons are jangling America 's nerves .
There is the emergence of China as a rival embryonic superpower , with an economy that may soon be bigger than America 's ( at least in terms of purchasing power ) ; the re-emergence of a bellicose , gas - fired Russia ; North Korea 's defiance of Uncle Sam by going nuclear , and Iran 's determination to follow suit ; Europe 's lack of enthusiasm for George Bush 's war on terror ; the Arabs ' dismissal of his democratisation project ; the Chávez - led resistance to Yankee capitalism in America 's backyard .
Nor is it just a matter of geopolitics .
American bankers are worried that other financial centres are gaining at Wall Street 's expense .
Nativists fret about America 's inability to secure its own borders .
As for soft power , Abu Ghraib , Guantánamo Bay , America 's slowness to tackle climate change and its neglect of the Palestinians have all , rightly or wrongly , cost it dearly .
Polls show that ever fewer foreigners trust America , and some even find China 's totalitarians less dangerous .
Power to the wrong people
A sense of waning power is not just bad for the self - esteem of Americans .
It is already having dangerous consequences .
Inside the United States , “ China - bashing ” has become a defensive strategy for both the left and the right .
Isolationism is also on the rise .
Most Democrats already favour an America that “ minds its own business ” .
Outside America , the consequences could be even graver .
Iran 's Islamic revolutionaries and Russia 's Vladimir Putin have both bet in different ways that a bruised Uncle Sam will not be able to constrain them .
Meanwhile , a vicious circle of no confidence threatens the Western alliance : if Italy , for instance , concludes that a weakened America will not last the course in Afghanistan , then it will commit even fewer troops to the already undermanned NATO force there — which in turn prompts more Americans to question the project .
Yet America is being underestimated .
Friends and enemies have mistaken the short - term failure of the Bush administration for deeper weakness .
Neither American hard nor soft power is fading .
Rather , they are not being used as well as they could be .
The opportunity is greater than the threat .
It is hard to deny that America looks weaker than it did in 2000 .
But is that really due to a tectonic shift or to the errors of a single administration ?
Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld reversed the wise Rooseveltian doctrine , “ Speak softly and carry a big stick ” .
After September 11th the White House talked up American power to an extraordinary degree .
In that brief period of “ shock and awe ” when Americans were from Mars , their Venutian allies were lucky to get invited to the show ( indeed , in Afghanistan some “ old ” Europeans were initially turned away ) .
Meanwhile , Mr Bush declared a “ war on terror ” , rather than just on al - Qaeda , broadening the front to unmanageable dimensions ( and paving the way for Guantánamo ) .
While the talk was loud , the stick was spindly .
Defying his generals , Mr Rumsfeld sent too few troops to Iraq to pacify the country .
Disbanding the Iraqi army compounded the error .
Regardless of whether Iraq was ever winnable , it is hard to imagine any future American administrations making such schoolboy howlers when it comes to regime change .
America the indispensable
Yet in one way Mr Bush is unfairly maligned .
Contrary to the Democratic version of history , America did not enjoy untrammelled influence abroad before he arrived .
The country that won the cold war also endured several grievous reverses , notably Vietnam ( where 58,000 Americans were killed — 16 times the figure for Iraq ) .
Iran has been defying America since Jimmy Carter 's presidency , and North Korea for a generation before that .
As for soft power , France has been complaining about Coca - Cola and Hollywood for nearly a century .
From this perspective of relative rather than absolute supremacy , a superpower 's strength lies as much in what it can prevent from happening as in what it can achieve .
Even today , America's “ negative power ” is considerable .
Very little of any note can happen without at least its acquiescence .
Iran and North Korea can defy the Great Satan , but only America can offer the recognition the proliferating regimes crave .
In all sorts of areas — be it the fight against global warming or the quest for an Arab - Israeli peace — America is quite simply indispensable .
That is because America still has the most hard power .
Its volunteer army is indeed stretched : it could not fight another small war of choice .
But it can still muster 1.5 m people under arms and a defence budget almost as big as the whole of the rest of the world's .
And it could call on so much more : in relation to the country 's size , its defence budget and army are quite small by historical standards .
Better diplomacy would enhance its power .
One irony of the “ war on terror ” is that Mr Bush 's hyperventilation worked against him in terms of getting boots on the ground : neither his own countrymen nor his allies were sure enough that they were really under threat .
( And why should they be ?
An American - led West spent four decades tussling with a nuclear - armed empire that stretched from Berlin to Vladivostok ; al - Qaeda is still small beer . )
The surveys that show America 's soft power to be less respected than it used to be also show the continuing universal appeal of its values — especially freedom and openness .
Even the immigrants and foreign goods that so worry some Americans are tributes to that appeal ( by contrast , the last empire to build a wall on its border , the Soviet one , was trying to keep its subjects in ) .
Nor is it an accident that anti-Americanism has fed off those instances , such as Guantánamo Bay , where America has seemed most un-American .
This is the multiplier effect that Mr Bush missed : win the battle for hearts and minds and you do not need as much hard power to get your way .
That lesson is worth bearing in mind when it comes to the challenge of China .
China is likely to be more and more in America 's face , whether buying American firms , winning Olympic gold or blasting missiles into space .
Merely by growing , China is disrupting the politics of the Pacific .
But that does not mean that it is automatically on track to overtake America .
Its politics are fragile ( see article ) and America 's lead is immense .
Moreover , economics is not a zero- sum game : so far , a bigger China has helped to enrich America .
An America that stays open to China — an America that sticks to American values — is much more likely to help fashion the China it wants .
If America were a stock , it would be a “ buy ” : an undervalued market leader , in need of new management .
But that points to its last great strength .
More than any rival , America corrects itself .
Under pressure from voters , Mr Bush has already rediscovered some of the charms of multilateralism ; he is talking about climate change ; a Middle East peace initiative is possible .
Next year 's presidential election offers a chance for renewal .
Such corrections are not automatic : something ( a misadventure in Iran ? ) may yet compound the misery of Iraq in the same way Watergate followed Vietnam .
But America recovered from the 1970s .
It will bounce back stronger again .
( CNN ) --
The most expensive toy commercial ever made , " Transformers , " Michael Bay 's live - action film about the surprisingly durable Hasbro product line , is long , loud and altogether less than meets the eye .
Optimus Prime , a good Transformer , looms over the landscape in " Transformers . "
A blockbuster for 8 - year - olds -- and , I guess , those older boys who never grew up -- " Transformers " will buzz its youthful demographic ( the effects are incredible ) but leave the rest of us wondering if Hollywood could possibly aim lower .
For the uninitiated , the Transformers are sentient machines from outer space .
To pass undetected on Earth they assume the form of everyday consumer objects -- mostly , here , American trucks and cars -- but in their true configuration they are colossal robot warriors with the firepower to match .
The Autobots are the good guys , led by sanctimonious Optimus Prime .
Then there are the evil Decepticons , led by Megatron , whose role is basically to blow stuff up .
Despite their name , the Decepticons show themselves first , with a devastating ( and oh - so - topical ) strike on a U.S. military base in Qatar .
It 's not the massacre of the troops that troubles the Pentagon so much as a stealth hack attack on their computer network .
Could the Iranians have developed such cyber smarts ?
And where 's " Die Hard 's " John McClane when you need him ?
Meanwhile , back in the U.S.A. , high school geek Sam Witwicky ( rising star Shia LaBeouf ) is the befuddled new owner of a beaten - up yellow Camaro with a matchmaking streak .
Like a certain VW love bug , the car starts and stalls at will , and likes to select golden oldies as romantic cues .
It 's only when Sam sees it slip away one night and transform into an Autobot named Bumblebee that he realizes this must be more than a quirky optional extra .
A filmmaker who has profitably plundered his own arrested adolescence in movies like " Bad Boys , " " The Rock " and " Armageddon , " director Michael Bay got his fingers burned two years ago with the relatively sophisticated sci-fi flop " The Island . "
It 's obvious he 's not going to be caught overestimating his audience twice .
Do n't miss
What did you think of ' Transformers ' ?
Let us know
Even so , Bay is the wrong man for the job , something producer Steven Spielberg should have known .
Bay 's penchant for designer machismo and piledriver action ( not to mention wholesale product placement ) does n't sit well with the Transformers ' appropriately juvenile comedy and a sub-Spielbergian suburban teen romance .
Innocence and wonder -- the type of human traits fundamental to Spielberg 's vision of childhood -- are not in Bay 's tool kit .
Megan Fox , for example , who plays Sam 's high school crush Mikaela , looks and sounds exactly like the 20 - year - old FHM babe she really is .
Mind you , unless they 're moms , all Bay 's women look and sound this way ( just ask Scarlett Johansson ) .
But it 's military hardware that really revs his engine .
Bay shoots weaponry in an orgasmic rapture , always in slow motion and against the sunset .
Not surprisingly , the military was happy to play its part when it came to supplying props for what often resembles a teenage recruitment film .
Even the movie 's theme -- hollow words about victory through sacrifice -- is pitched to this constituency .
Setting about the action sequences with real vigor , Bay seems to imagine he 's remaking " War of the Worlds , " or maybe embarking on " Terminator 4 . "
And to be fair , the Transformers in motion are something to see -- as with several of this year 's event pictures , the effects guys have surpassed themselves .
But the illusion is shattered whenever the ' bots start talking or the action stops .
Bay tries to gloss over the infantile plot , but it would take a lighter , wittier touch to square the movie 's pedestrian script with its excitable vision of impending auto - geddon .
At least John Turturro , who shows up at the halfway mark as an unsympathetic government operative , seems to have understood that " manic " is the only appropriate response .
First he 's stripped to his underpants , then a monstrous machine relieves itself all over him .
After 144 minutes of " Herbie Goes to War , " I knew just how he felt .
" Transformers " runs 144 minutes and is rated PG - 13 .

According to the science department at Texyt Labs , this product is n't quite as ridiculous as it seems .
Actually , your face or body shape CAN be gradually altered by this kind of steady pressure .
Anybody who has had an ear ( or other appendage ) pierced has experienced this – if you do n't keep the hole open , it 'll slowly close up .
But we dread to imagine what kind of misshapen nose you could end up with , if this gimcrack $ 7.50 contraption goes awry .
Not to mention the embarrassment of constantly looking like a synchronized swimmer who forgot to take her nose clip off .
Hey , but if you do want to take the plunge , do n't forget : there 's nothing to prevent you applying this to other body parts you want reshaped
Sports Blotter : " The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club " edition
February 21 , 2007 2:50:53 PM
HMMM ...:
Some high - school football players missed the point of Fight Club
A bunch of former high - school football players from Murrieta , California , are in serious trouble after being booked on a variety of bizarre charges for their involvement with a “ fight club ” created in honor of the surprisingly good eponymous Brad Pitt vehicle .
At least seven young men were arrested on suspicion of assault , burglary and making terror threats , among other things .
The group wore caps with an “ FC ” emblem and initially fought each other in parks in Riverside County ; they also beat up other students who bad - mouthed their members .
“ Eventually , the gang began fighting at house parties where adults were not present , intimidating and beating guests , then returning later to burglarize the homes , ” a local police official said .
The members were also charged with possession of firearms and anabolic steroids .
Apparently the kids missed the point of Fight Club , which upheld fight clubs as a heroic fictional escape from consumerism and the bourgeois ennui of corporate middle - management cubicle slaves .
Fight clubs in the movie were for people who were , in reality , too meek and too powerless to fight against the soullessness of modern existence .
They were not for a bunch of beered - up , over - aggressive football - playing douche bags on steroids .
But hey , high - school football is not for kids with brains .
Neither is prison , where these idiots will hopefully learn how fun fighting is in real life .
I ’m giving these swine a 75 on the crime scale for being vicious , classless , charmless bullies ; let ’s hope they get serious time .
Yankee went home — drunk
Steve Swindal , son - in - law to George Steinbrenner and the probable heir to the Yankee throne , was busted for a DUI in St. Petersburg , Florida , after police caught him doing 61 in a 35 zone .
I ’m giving him 98 points on the crime scale , the highest possible score for a non-murder , because Swindal 1 ) is a Yankee official 2 ) is a Yankee official , and 3 ) voluntarily married into the family of George Steinbrenner .
Also , he drove drunk .
The arrest affidavit credited Swindal with “ slurred , mumbled speech , ” “ bloodshot , watery eyes , ” and “ swaying , stumbling , staggering motor control . ”
After his arrest , Swindal tried , like the lying Yankee scum that he is , to list his employer as “ Marine Towing . ”
He is chairman of that company , but his main job is with the Yankees , where he is General Partner .
Police had to deduce this by going through his wallet .
Otherwise , we might never have found out .
The fact that we almost did n’t get to make a big deal out of this tempts me to bump Swindal up to a 99 .
Police caught the 52 year - old husband of “ Jennifer ” Steinbrenner ( it appalls me that Steinbrenner ’s children have regular human names ) after he made a sharp left turn in front of a police cruiser , causing the police to take evasive action .
“ Mr. Swindal apologizes profusely for this distraction during Spring Training , ” said Yankee spokesman Howard Rubenstein .
No word yet on whether Florida officials will seek the death penalty .
We ’ll keep you posted .
Minot where ?
Ronnie Fields , a player from the Minot ( North Dakota ) Skyrockets , has been arrested on a sexual - assault charge , putting the CBA on the national media map for the first time since the Isaiah Thomas era .
Police responded to a sexual - assault report at a north Minot hotel Friday night , and eventually booked Fields for abusing a 24 - year - old woman .
Fields has been in trouble before .
In 1996 , he was booked on a sexual - abuse charge in Wheaton , Illinois , in an incident that involved two other men .
He was convicted of a misdemeanor in that case and got two years ’ probation .
Fields was removed from the roster after the arrest and , in fact , has not played since he sprained an ankle on February 8 .
It is not yet known if anyone has noticed his absence , or , indeed , if anyone in the country is even aware that the CBA still exists .
I ’m giving Fields a 50 for the sex - abuse rap , minus ten points for the indignity of playing pro basketball against teams with names like the Patroons .
The tally for this year :
JOCK TEAM CRIME PTS
LaVon Chisley , Penn State : murder 99
Steve Swindal , Yankees : DUI 98
Murrieta jocks , Murrieta : Fight Club various 75
6 Football Players , Guilford : assault 50 ( downgraded )

1 . Talk too much
It ’s not a conversation , and it ’s not a debate .
You are either treating their symptoms with medication , or guiding them to “ treat ” their own symptoms .
Neither requires much talking .
If the psychiatrist says more words than the patient , then the psychiatrist is the patient .
Many psychiatrists talk because they feel powerless .
The patient is in distress .
How can the session be worth the money unless they get some thing ?
A prescription is good , but what else — what now ?
So the psychiatrist thinks they need to say something , to appear as though you are giving something to the patient .
The worse the situation is , the more the psychiatrist talks .
You ’re talking to make yourself feel better , to justify your value as a psychiatrist .
Do n’t do this .
It ’s not help .
And empathize , do n’t sympathize .
I cringe whenever I see a psychiatrist on the first visit try to sound genuine while they affect a sad and shocked voice , lean forward , grab a box of tissues , “ oh my God , I ’m so sorry , that ’s terrible ! ”
It ’s fake , which makes it annoying , but it ’s patronizing , which makes it countertherapeutic .
A psychiatrist cannot sympathize — did the same thing happen to you ?.
What they need to do is empathize , to understand the feelings , to appreciate them — not to share them .
Plus , you do n’t know what the situation means to the patient .
Maybe they ’re secretly happy ( and guilty about it ) , and now that you ’ve confirmed that it ’s “ terrible , ” they ’ll never admit to you or themselves they ’re happy about it .
Simply saying , “ I ’m sorry .
Can you tell me more about … ” is all that ’s necessary .
And enough with the tissues .
If you stalled the interview to go get them a box of tissues , you have failed , you changed the energy of a key moment .
And you did this — let ’s be honest — not because they needed tissues , but because it took some pressure off the moment and allowed you to give them something .
Leave tissues by the patient chair from the beginning , and focus on what you ’re doing .
I had a great mentor who taught me to begin the first session with the words , “ Where would you like to begin ? ”
And then to shut up .
Great advice .
2 . Take too much history
This is going to be controversial .
I can hear academics seizing .
I know psychiatrists are taught that careful , meticulous history taking is the cornerstone of good care .
Well , it ’s not .
Every session should be about the patient , not about you .
You ’re supposed to help them , not understand them .
The two may go together , but they might not .
It is possible for you to help without understanding , but it is not acceptable for you to understand without helping .
You ’re not CSI , you ’re not Batman , you ’re not trying to solve a mystery or make some aha ! discovery .
They ’re telling you what ’s wrong .
Just listen .
Taking a detailed history may seem like a good idea , but many times it is masturbation , it contributes nothing to the patient ’s well being , it only makes us feel thorough .
As in : well , I ca n’t do much for him , but I got a really good history .
Remember , it ’s not about you , it ’s about them .
It may seem as if a strong family history of bipolar disorder is important information , but it is n’t .
I know , bipolar runs in families and blah blah blah .
You could n’t tell they were bipolar before you learned their family history ?
And how do you know the family ’s diagnosis was correct , so that you can rely on it to make your diagnosis ?
I ’m not saying do n’t get the information .
I am saying devoting the first one or two sessions exclusively to this gains the patient nothing .
Everything from the moment they walk through the door should be about their service .
Forget about the notes , especially outpatient notes .
Worry about the patient , the notes should come second .
Are you proud of your notes because they contain so much detailed patient information ?
You need to think about this .
Did you break eye contact to write , “ sad over husband ’s loss ? ”
Then you missed the moment .
Just listen — write your notes after the session .
And if I see one more psychiatrist with a note pad playing stenographer I am going to punch him in the neck .
3. Ignore smoking cessation
or at least make it a secondary outcome .
Also applies to soda / juice / calorie reduction .
This may seem trivial .
It ’s not — after the treatment of the initial presenting acute symptoms and treating drug and alcohol abuse , this is more important than almost anything in psychiatry .
The logic is as follows :
1. Smoking is obviously and severely detrimental to one ’s health , arguably more damaging than hypertension and depression combined .
Its effect on life expectancy rivals , well , arsenic .
2 . It is an addiction , so it is psychiatry ’s business .
3 . It is highly comorbid with psychiatric disorders , and may be a relative symptom of them .
( For example : half of all people who commit suicide smoke . )
4 . Smoking itself has a significant impact on other medications ( e.g. did you know it reduces Haldol by half ? )
5 . What the hell else are you doing with the session ?
Especially in the “ maintenance ” phase of psychiatric treatment ( where symptoms are relatively controlled , etc ) .
All of this applies equally to soda consumption or even diet in general .
Drinking 2 liters of soda a day may not seem like a psychiatric issue , but most of the medications used have the propensity to increase appetite , and excess eating , smoking , soda drinking are hardly psychologically meaningless behaviors .
If your psychiatrist asks you to keep a mood chart or teaches you about “ serotonin dysfunction , ” but does n’t tell you to quit smoking , run .
He has missed the forest for the trees .
In order to understand why this is such a popular mistake among psychiatrists ( all doctors , actually ) it ’s useful to identify when psychiatrists do this .
There are two specific times .
The first is when psychiatrists seek to justify doing , or not doing , some clinical maneuver , as in , “ I ca n’t discharge him from the emergency room , even though I do n’t really believe he is suicidal , I think he is lying simply to get hospitalized -- but I do n’t want to get sued . ”
The second time is when psychiatrists seek to explain a reduction in income , as in , “ The insurance company only pays so much for a visit , so now I do only med checks . ”
What is striking about these justifications is that they almost never relate to the specific problem at hand , they are scapegoats for some general anger about the difficulty of practice .
For example , in the example of the malingering emergency room patient , discharging him has no increased risk of legal liability because if the patient is , in fact , malingering , then he will not kill himself .
The operational issue here is not one of increased legal liability , but whether a physician can detect malingering .
This has nothing to do with lawyers .
In the second example , while it is certainly true that the insurance company has set reimbursement rates , psychiatrists have not explored their responsibility in this .
They have not , in any scientific , economic , and most importantly policy way , justified the necessity for a different ( read : higher ) reimbursement scheme .
Consider psychiatrists ’ attitudes towards psychologists acquiring prescribing privileges .
It seems obvious that psychologists should n’t prescribe medications , but why not , exactly ?
To say that psychiatrists are trained in medicine and better understand drug - drug interactions , dosing , and toxicities presupposes that the average psychiatrist actually does know about drug - drug interactions , dosing and toxicities .
Really ?
What ’s the interaction between Prozac and hydralazine ?
Do n’t know ?
Then why should psychologists know ?
And if you can look it up , so can they , etc , etc .
Also , using this reasoning could backfire , as it can justify an insurance company refusing to pay for a psychiatric med check since the service could be performed by a primary care doctor ( who will also handle everything else for the same low price . )
Again , it is easy to complain , but it is on psychiatrists to explain , rationally , why it should not be .
Consider the common complaint that each insurance company has its own formulary , requiring doctors to prescribe alternatives , generics , or submit prior authorization requests .
This is taken as bureaucratic interference of patient care .
However , in the majority of the cases these restrictions are economically and clinically valid .
No logic , let alone evidence , exists for prescribing two antipsychotics simultaneously .
So why should the insurance allow it ?
Similarly , an insurance company should be allowed to approve drugs based on cost , because unless one can show that , for example , two SSRIs do not have the same general efficacy or tolerability across a population , than an insurance company cannot be reasonably obligated to provide both , especially if it can contract to receive one of the SSRIs at a cheaper cost .
To be clear : it may , in fact , be true that ( for example ) two antipsychotics are better than one .
But the burden of responsibility is on psychiatrists to show that this ( or any clinical ) maneuver is necessary , and not on the insurance companies to simply trust that doctors know best , because they have shown repeatedly that they do not .
Blaming lawyers has almost become a sport .
It is certainly true that uncapped awards for damages hurts everyone ( except lawyers . )
However , lawyers are good at picking malpractice cases , not at inventing them .
Consider informed consent : if one prescribes valproate for maintenance , one must not only discuss the side effects , but also the alternatives to treatment -- especially when the alternatives to Depakote ( a drug which has neither approval for maintenance nor rigorous data backing it ) do have such approval and data ( consider lithium , Zyprexa , Lamictal , etc . )
To prescribe Depakote because it is at the top of an algorithm or in the “ guidelines ” , or because “ that is my practice ” and not because of a reasoned analysis of the individual merits of the case , is at minimum not thoughtful practice .
A similar example is psychiatry ’s current obsession with antipsychotic induced diabetes .
Assume that Geodon does indeed have a much lower risk of diabetes than Zyprexa ; is a psychiatrist any less liable if the diabetes is induced by Geodon and not Zyprexa ?
No .
You do n’t get sued for using Zyprexa .
You get sued for causing diabetes and never picking it up .
To state explicitly what seems the most obvious point of all : if a medication causes a side effect , and you catch it , there ’s no lawsuit , because there ’s no damage .
The above examples come from misunderstanding the available scientific literature , or not knowing it at all .
Oddly , if a lawyer does not research the current state of case law and statutes before answering any legal question , it is legal malpractice .
But doctors practicing medicine are not required to review current journal articles on any medical condition .
Pharma is the most maligned of all .
On the one hand doctors resent the intrusion of the industry on their practice ; on the other hand , industry is the primary — often only -- ongoing educational source for doctors , whether they believe this or not .
Drug reps , throwaway journals and supplements , “ drug dinners ” and almost all CMEs ( yes , CMEs too , stop lying ) are all industry sponsored educational processes which are the de facto continuing education of most psychiatrists .
Oh , right , right -- doctors learn by regularly reading numerous journals carefully and thoroughly .
Ok -- ask them to name one article in the most recent issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry .
Not the results of the study ; just the title .
One may want to ask why the FDA feels it necessary to hold pharmaceutical reps to extremely strict standards : they cannot mislead , they cannot speak off label , they must discuss side effects and toxicities , and they cannot use any promotional material that was not reviewed by the FDA .
Used car salesmen are not held to any standards , and they sell to idiots .
No one needs to tell you the rate of blowouts on a Firestone tire .
Why would doctors — the most educated consumer group in existence — need protection from salespeople ?
Should n’t doctors , ultimately , know more about the medications than the sales reps do ?
Unless …
The sad truth is that the state of psychiatry is the fault of psychiatrists , who have failed to take full responsibility for their own education and practice .
To blame anyone else at this stage is remarkably disingenuous .
5 . Become social policy analysts
Remember how in May , 2005 , the American Psychiatric Association endorsed same sex marriage ?
And you applauded the moral fortitude and progressive instinct of this august body ?
Well , instead of debating whether there should or should not be same - sex marriage , perhaps we should ask what modern psychiatry could possibly contribute to this discussion .
The answer is nothing .
You can't get away with pat answers , such as psychiatrists see the psychiatric ramifications of discrimination or being unable to marry .
There are psychiatric ramifications of bankruptcy , and war , but no one felt compelled to write a policy statement on it ( and thank God . )
And no , there is n't a difference between bankruptcy and gay marriage -- not to psychiatry .
That 's the point .
These are social problems about which modern psychiatry is definitionally ignorant .
The APA did not endorse polygamy .
What 's the difference ?
If homosexuality is not a psychiatric disorder , than there is no more reason to be more for or against it than there is for any other kind of marriage .
The APA is no better suited to answering these questions than , say , the NFL .
What if the NFL came out against antidepressants in children ?
This is a perfectly valid analogy , because neither the NFL nor psychiatry have special knowledge that make their statements anything more than opinions .
What do psychiatrists know about same - sex marriage that the quarterback for the Patriots does n’t ?
Do n’t laugh — I ’m serious .
What ’s the answer ?
Medicine , or the APA , can legitimately express a policy only if the policy was grounded in science or logic .
Perhaps the APA cares to release this intriguing scientific data ?
( While it is at it , perhaps it can also release the data supporting the use of half of the medications currently favored by APA Guidelines ? )
But this seems pretty much business as usual for the APA .
Rather than work on its own serious failings , it involves itself in social policy .
“ Modern ” ( read : pharmacological ) psychiatry is obsessed with reinventing itself as a biological and scientific discipline .
Well , if it wants to be a science , it better start acting like one .
The FDA effectively killed Vioxx , and not a peep was heard from the APA about the dangers of letting the government regulate their practice .
You can say Vioxx has little to do with psychiatry , but it ’s still a lot more than gay marriage .
Determining what is true and what is not , through serious and often disconcerting scientific enquiry , is very difficult .
It is much easier to involve oneself in matters of opinion and debate , in activism , because it is both immediately rewarding and it is easy .
It ’s hard to measure things in psychiatry , and when it is possible the results are often disappointing .
So it busies itself with matters of conviction because it feels some responsibility to have convictions .
It does n't .
It has a responsibility to the truth , and if it does n't want to invest any energy in that pursuit , it is on them .
But do n't mask it with whimsy and dilettantism .
I should point out that gays , far from being pleased with the APA ’s stand , should actually be horrified .
Do you -- does anyone -- want social policy suggested by psychiatrists ?
Think long and hard .
Imagine the outrage if the APA had come out against gay marriage , or for the war in Iraq .
There would be battalions of people saying , " well , what the hell do psychiatrists know about war in Iraq ?
Who the hell do they think they are telling gays not to get married ? "
There is no protection in being confident of the rightness of your current position , as history is loaded with examples of how terribly bad doctors are at determining what is right and what is wrong .
Not long ago homosexuality was considered a disease .
See ?
The Tuskegee experiments were endorsed by the AMA , and the AMA gave its endorsement , after ethics concerns were raised by Peter Buxtun .
Remember that ?
How about the speech to the 1941 APA meeting , and the 1942 issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry in which euthanizing the “ feebleminded ” ( IQ < 65 ) sounded like a good idea ?
Psychiatry would do well to remember Wittgenstein TLP 7 : Whereof one cannot speak , thereof one must be silent .
6 . Do n’t refer to therapy .
Psychopharmacology without therapy is treating an infection with Tylenol .
Medications do not cure a psychiatric disease ; we ’re not even sure what the disease actually is .
What they can do is reduce symptoms , give you strength — so that you can learn new behaviors .
That ’s the point of medications .
Treating depression with an antidepressant is not the solution ; it ’s the preliminary step in allowing you to figure out how to handle depression later on .
The adaptation , the adjustment , the physical altering of brain functioning is done by new learning , often this is therapy ( though it does n’t have to be . )
I ’m not saying therapy is that great , or necessary , either .
I ’m simply saying that trying to improve a person ’s long term status using medications alone without some sort of education and training is a waste of time .
It is maybe the most profound disservice of all to tell a patient that their depressive or bipolar symptoms are the result of biology or chemical imbalances and thus absolve them of the responsibility of learning new ways of interpreting and coping with their environment .
7 . Do n’t think strategically .
Psychiatry is fun , I ’m sure , but it does n’t help anybody when the patient refuses to play .
Psychiatry telling us opiate abuse is a heritable disorder related to polymorphisms in dopamine receptors does n’t stop your kid from stealing your money to buy smack .
See ?
Sometimes you have to hide your wallet .
What is the goal ?
What do you have to do to achieve that goal ?
Sometimes you have to look beyond the DSM .
Do what you have to do .
When a person needs treatment but is refusing it , neither the law nor psychiatry can help them .
I ca n’t force someone into treatment .
But you can .
Take drug abuse : in my experience , the only way to get someone to ( albeit reluctantly ) accept treatment is a large scale intervention .
10 people , minimum , in a cramped room with the future patient trapped as far form the door as possible , all ten in energetic agreement that the person needs to get help -- now .
Not tomorrow morning .
Immediately .
You ’ve already packed his bags .
This is n’t a five minute pep -talk — take the whole day off , you ’re going to be there a while .
Also , a psychiatrist cannot do this for you , he should n’t even be there , because no one ever listens to neutral third parties , much less psychiatrists .
( And I 'll just say it : you probably do n't want a psychiatrist there in case you ... have to take things … to the next level ... )
It has to be ten highly motivated , concerned people .
If you are not motivated enough to stage this uncomfortable intervention , I assure you he wo n’t be motivated to go .
This is the kind of thing a psychiatrist should be telling you , not trying to sell you on Suboxone .
Nobody likes confrontation or to be confronted .
Ten people .
Minimum .
Sure , you are partly guilting them into treatment , partly coercing .
But getting them into treatment in this way is better than not getting them into treatment in a nicer way .
Psychiatry is war .
Sometimes people do n’t need to know .
If a person ’s life is changed on medication , it may be okay not to tell them all the side effects .
I know , lawyers are standing by ( see # ( blame lawyers ) , but again , it ’s strategy , and I think reasonable people ( i.e. juries ) will understand what you were doing .
If lithium keeps the person from slitting their own throat , it ’s okay to skip the part about how it can hurt your thyroid .
It does n’t exempt the doctor from checking for it , mind you .
In these tricky situations , a ) you have to be sure this medication is absolutely vital ; b ) recruit as many people as possible into the therapeutic umbrella .
Tell the wife about the side effect ; tell family what to watch out for .
And monitor .
There ’s even a technical term for this therapeutic privilege , but I ca n’t remember what it was .
Save the environment .
Here ’s an all too common scenario involving no strategic thinking :
Your adult child is living at home , no job , sporadic drug use , involved in an abusive relationship , frequent quasi- suicidal acts , etc .
You ’ve tried everything , nothing has worked .
You do n’t know what to do .
You ’re afraid to kick them out because they can’t manage on their own , you ’re afraid they ’d sink deeper into drugs / depression / etc ; but on the other hand you have other kids you have to worry about , a finite supply of money , etc , etc .
You ’re paralyzed .
Here ’s a question you might not have thought about : what happens to the kid when you die ?
They are suddenly going to be without support , suddenly without money , suddenly without resources .
Will they simply manipulate your spouse into getting their needs met ?
Or worse , go somewhere else ?
Is that what you want ?
Plan today , now , for this eventuality .
Maybe that means setting up a trust with a finite monthly payout only if they are living on their own and have a paycheck .
Or only if they are seeing a therapist once a week .
Or give clean urines .
“ What is this , probation ? ” Actually , that ’s exactly what it is .
You have to save the environment you are in before you can help the other person .
That means protecting your wife and other kids , and their physical assets .
It means protecting your marriage .
It may seem cold to worry about money when your kid’s on heroin , but I assure you that this is the most important thing you can do if the kid wo n’t get help .
Ripping apart your marriage over this benefits no one , absolutely no one .
So yes , it may mean kicking them out of the house , cutting them off .
It also means doing an intervention .
It means holding your breath that that phone is going to ring in the middle of the night and it ’s going to be the police .
But letting them eat , sleep , and watch TV in your house while their chaos continues does not lessen the risk of receiving that phone call .
It ’s called enabling .
Do n’t do it .
And a psychiatrist should be telling you this , not trying to give you Celexa to help you cope with it .
8. Polypharmacy
Polypharmacy is n't just common -- it 's the codified standard .
When two psychiatrists discuss a patient , inevitably one of them will say these four words : “ You should consider adding … ”
The paradigm is that if you fail a medication , you must be so sick that you need a second medication .
It 's a useful paradigm ; and by useful , of course , I mean wrong .
Here 's an alternative paradigm : maybe if the medication did n't work , you should try a different one ?
Polypharmacy would be ok if there was at least some data justifying it .
But there is n't .
I know , controversial .
Look it up .
Consider antipsychotics : if anyone can provide the logic -- not data , simply the logic -- for using two simultaneously , I 'd love to hear it .
Antipsychotics work by blocking dopamine receptors , of which there are supposedly a finite number .
If one antipsychotic blocks most of them , where is the other supposed to go ?
Why could n't you simply increase the dose of the first ?
And if side effects prevent this increase , why would n't you just switch to the second medication ?
Same with antidepressants : Zoloft and Prozac are SSRIs , they target the exact same molecule , which is again finite in number .
If most are blocked by one drug , where does the second go ?
Why are you offended that Medicaid does n't let you prescribe two at the same time ?
So you say : well , what about mixing two drugs of differing pharmacologies , like Zoloft ( serotonin ) and Wellbutrin ( dopamine / norepinephrine ) ?
At least there is logic to this one , but -- surprise - no evidence .
It may seem as though Zoloft + Wellbutrin , or Depakote + an antipsychotic , etc is better than one alone , but they 're not .
But here ’s the point : even if it were true , so what ?
How do you know it ’s necessary ?
Should n't prudence and common sense and fiscal responsibility and the cramp in your writing hand require you to at least try monotherapy a few times ?
Twice , at least ?
Because I can't prove two drugs are better than one , but I can prove they are twice as toxic and twice as expensive .
Polypharmacy is bastard child of the theory of maintenance treatment .
If it took three medications to get you feeling better , then you need to continue these three medications in order to stay stable .
Going off your medications results in disaster .
First of all , no .
Secondly , take the example of mania .
If you 're manic , and it took three medications to bring the mania down , does that mean you need those three for the rest of your life ?
Because if so , what do you do the next time you get manic ?
Add a fourth ?
Do n’t you get used to medications ?
Does tolerance not occur ?
Upregulation and all that ?
You see the problem -- maintenance begats polypharmacy .
Also , medications have side effects , and so medications are given for the side effects of the other
medications , ad nauseum .
At some point ( four medications ? ) the symptoms you are seeing cannot be reliably ascribed to the disorder rather than the medications themselves .
The patient is buried .
The treatment now becomes getting them off these medications .
Again : it may be true that an individual person needs several medications .
But you can't make polypharmacy a generalized treatment standard .
It 's too expensive and has too many side effects for a theoretical benefit .
And what kind of message does it send to the patient ?
If you 're on four medications , how can you be anything but severely ill , all the time ?
How can you be responsible for any of your feelings , or for controlling them ?
9 . Diagnose everything
The layman ’s argument is that psychiatry pathologizes everything : “ well , anyone would be depressed in those circumstances .
How is that an illness ?
And why can you get SSI for it ? ”
But the truth is in the nuances .
When psychiatrists ask you to keep a mood chart , and you report that on these two days your “ depression was worse , ” what allows the psychiatrist to know that was n’t normal sadness ?
Can a bipolar ever be sad for a month and not be depressed ?
If a person beats his girlfriends , kills cats , and gets brought by the police because he set fire to a rival ’s car , is it possible that his Axis I diagnosis is — nothing ?
Ok — how many times have you actually written that down ?
How many times have you terminated the “ treatment , ” or refused to uphold an involuntary commitment order , because the case was not psychiatric ?
I know , the system does not have a good mechanism for doing this .
I feel your pain .
But every time we give some vague “ Not Otherwise Specified ” diagnosis or pass them along to the inpatient services , we are creating a social policy disaster .
We are confirming to the laymen that we think these behaviors are psychiatric , that they are rightfully our purview , and ensuring that a ) we will be held responsible for dealing with them ; b ) we will be held responsible for the outcome .
Colbert : Bill O'Reilly thinks Daily Kos is ' like the Ku Klux Klan '

" I do n't want to talk about Iraq any more , " said Stephen Colbert on Wednesday 's Colbert Report .
" It 's too easy .
...
At least there 's one place that understands this : Fox News . "
" In the first quarter of this year , " Colbert continued , " Fox spent less time covering the Iraq War than either CNN or MSNBC .
Look , just because everyone else is reporting the US is jumping off a bridge in Iraq , that does n't mean
Fox should report it too .
They are focused on the Homeland . "
Colbert went on to discuss how Fox host Bill O'Reilly recently forced one sponsor to withdraw from " sponsoring a convention of bloggers from the far left ' webshite ' DailyKos.com . "
" This is n't an ideological issue , " O'Reilly said in clips shown by Colbert .
" If a company was sponsoring a David Duke convention , we'd do the same story .
...
It 's like the Ku Klux Klan , it 's like the Nazi Party . "
" Exactly , " commented Colbert .
" The Ku Klux Klan and the Nazis were both notorious for allowing people to express unpopular views in an open and free forum . "
" Do not go to DailyKos.com , " Colbert concluded , as he put the Daily Kos web address up on the screen " so viewers know where not to go . "
The following video is from Comedy Central 's Colbert Report , broadcast on July 25 .
Congress recently passed a resolution calling on the UN to bring charges of “ genocide ” against Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Now , I hold no brief for the Iranian ranter  whose jeremiads against the West are in the category of Borat - like humor  but this seems like yet another example of political pandering and congressional grandstanding that bears little , if any , relationship to reality .
To begin with , the resolution is motivated by a mistranslation of a speech given by Senor Ahmadinejad , in which he cited the Ayatollah Khomeini and seemed to call for Israel to be “ wiped off the map . ”
Yet , as this piece by Jonathan Steele , and this comment by Farsi - speaker and Middle East expert Prof.
Juan
Cole make very clear , that is not what the Iranian President said , or intended to say .
Ahmadinejad did n’t say Israel must be “ wiped off the map , ” he said the current regime in Tel Aviv will be “ wiped off the page of time . ”
It was a call for “ regime change ” not genocide  but , never mind .
Like most war propaganda , which is almost never related to reality except in the most tenuous sense , the point is not to tell the truth but to characterize the Enemy in a particular way .
With Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in Washington to ramp up the Lobby ’s ferocious campaign to get the US to attack Iran  or at least credibly threaten to  the pro-Israel forces on Capitol Hill were out in full force , herding their congressional supporters into a massive display of obedience with a whopping 411 - 2 vote in the House .
The complete hypocrisy of our “ antiwar ” Democratic congresscritters , who warble that we need to “ end the war ” in Iraq , even as they whoop it up for war with Iran , is so brazen that it does n’t require much comment .
I ’ll leave it to Mohammed ElBaradei , the IAEA chief , who bluntly told the BBC :
“ I wake up every morning and see 100 Iraqi innocent civilians are dying .
I have no brief other than to make sure we do n’t go into another war or that we go crazy into killing each other .
You do not want to give [ an ] additional argument to the new crazies who say ‘ let ’s go and bomb Iran . ’
Asked who the ‘ new crazies ’ were , the IAEA chief refused to be drawn , simply saying : ‘ Those who have extreme views and say the only solution is to impose your will by force . ' ”
On Capitol Hill , when it comes to Iran , the extremists are in charge , and they can rack up huge majorities .
While the resolution only goes as far as calling for more sanctions on Iran , rebuking the EU for not signing on to the stricter sanctions regime , it implies the imminence of an armed conflict when it condemns Tehran for having
“ Shown itself unwilling to use its influence to support peaceful transformation in the region , including by demonstrating its ability to strike United States military forces and allies in the Middle East with missiles being either incapable or unwilling to stop the movement of weapons produced in Iran into Iraq and other countries in the region in support of violent religious extremism . ”
By involving us in a region of the world where national boundaries  drawn by long - departed colonial overlords  are irrelevant and largely ignored in any case , the War Party has ineluctably drawn us into a regional conflict which the US Congress is even now fully ratifying ,  or , at least , is preparing to stand by while the President launches an attack .
Remember how House Speaker Nancy Pelosi infamously stripped out a provision of the Iraq war funding bill that would have required Bush to come to Congress before attacking Iran ?
Now we have this new resolution  passed at precisely the moment when it looks like the Iranians might agree to a proposal being floated by ElBaradei and the IAEA .
Coincidence ?
I hardly think so .
The War Party ’s main problem with the Iranians has been the prospect that peace might break out at any moment .
It is well - known that the Iranians have communicated their desire to negotiate this issue on several occasions , the most notable being when , in May , 2003 , they put everything on the table .
In a proposal [ .pdf ] transmitted to the US State Department via the Swiss , Tehran offered to discuss its nuclear program and also dangled the possibility of turning Hezbollah into a purely socio-political body , while also cutting off aid to militant Palestinian groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad .
What the Iranians wanted in return was the lifting of sanctions , security guarantees , and the complete normalization of relations .
The proposal was scotched by the Cheney cabal , according to Colin Powell ’s former chief aide Flynt Leverett , and  get this !
 the Swiss ambassador was rebuked for having the temerity to transmit it .
To add to the War Party ’s problems , a strong Iranian reform movement has arisen , with demonstrated electoral clout , which undercuts their caricature of Ahmadinejad as an Iranian Hitler who heads up a totalitarian society determined to acquire nukes .
As President , Ahmadinejad wields almost no influence over foreign and military policy , and no totalitarian dictator is ever mocked as Ahmadinejad was by university students , who set off firecrackers during a recent speech .
Which brings us to another point : the popularity of Western culture with Iranian young people is almost as strong as their nationalistic sentiments  which make these same pro-Western youngsters strongly supportive of Iran ’s right to develop nuclear power .
Such subtleties are lost on this Congress , however .
The vote on this resolution  which is , let ’s face it , pure war propaganda  dramatizes the grim reality we now face .
The only dissidents  Ron Paul , R - Texas , and Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio  represent , respectively , the far “ right ” and far “ left ” wings of their parties .
Both opposed the Iraq war from the very beginning , have warned against the danger of escalating it into a regional conflict involving Iran  and are declared presidential candidates , currently polling in the single digits .
And so the great neoconservative foreign policy consensus , which has been periodically proclaimed through the years by various neocon triumphalists , has once again settled , like a poisonous fog , over the political landscape .
Back in the 1950s , you ’ll remember , it was “ The end of ideology , ” and in the 1990s , just after the final death throes of the old Soviet Union , it was “ the end of history . ”
Today , we have The End of Dissent .
Dissent  against what ?
Against the bipartisan consensus in favor of Empire , against the neoconservative foreign policy program of perpetual war , against the rise of Napoleonic versions of both “ liberalism ” and conservatism .
On the left , the “ out now ” anti-interventionism of Kucinich has been marginalized by the three Democratic “ majors ” 
Hillary , Obama , and Edwards  who , all three of them , are just as hawkish as any neocon when it comes to Iran .
On the right , the thoroughly neoconized , Rush Limbaugh–Sean Hannity – National Review axis of pro-war dead - enders are determined to take the GOP down with them , although it remains to be seen how many party leaders and activists will take to this lemming - like behavior .
Ever since World War II , the neocons  yes , they ’ve been around since the Truman era  have been proclaiming the “ end of This ” and the “ end of That , ” and what it means and has always meant is the termination of all debate on the key question of republic versus empire .
For them , discussion begins once all agree that we are indeed an empire , and certainly intend to remain one .
Anyone who stands outside this proclaimed “ consensus ” is , by definition , a kook , an “ extremist , ” and not a “ credible ” candidate for anything other than swift marginalization .
The great problem for the War Party , when it comes to the home front , is that the “ center ” they claim to represent does n’t support them or their war plans .
The overwhelming majority of the American people want out of Iraq , and they are n’t jumping on the “ let ’s bomb Iran ” bandwagon that Norman Podhoretz wants to be leading .
The two “ extremists , ” Paul and Kucinich , are actually much closer to popular sentiment on this question than the upholders of the supposedly “ mainstream ” view .
This irony underscores how the game is rigged , not only electorally but also intellectually , in favor of the War Party .
By maintaining a firm grip on the levers of power  the media as well as the two “ major ” political parties  the pro-war elites impose their will on the pro-peace majority .
Yet the experience of the past four years , and the catastrophic potential of a war with Iran , have awakened a considerable portion of the population , including both “ right ” and “ left ” war critics , who have begun to raise their voices in protest .
On the right , we have analysts such as Andrew Bacevich , as learned as he is eloquent , whose critique of the neocons ’ foreign policy hubris is rooted in clear - headed realism and emotion passionately felt .
On the progressive left , such commentators as Jim Lobe , Matthew Yglesias , and Alexander Cockburn , to mention only a few , have provided trenchant analyses of our current entanglements that complement the Old Right American - interests - narrowly - defined perspective of , say , the editors of The American Conservative .
The neocons  of the Weekly Standard “ right ” and New Republic “ left ” varieties  are desperately seeking to shore up a crumbling intellectual consensus that was formerly in favor of all - out interventionism , and now is n’t so sure .
The intellectuals , as usual , are behind the general public when it comes to an idea whose time has come , and should come .
The politicians , however , are even further behind , as the recent bout of congressional saber - rattling in Iran ’s direction shows .

Only us overeducated and neurotic San Franciscans can fuck up something simple as casual sex , and all over definitions .
So , as a public service , here follows the definitions of some ( some is key here ) of the sexual liaisons available to the discerning urbanite :
Sex With No Strings .
Pretty simple , and to the point - humping .
Lots of it .
Usually in one session - thus , no strings .
In other words , no expectations of future humping , unless a new relationship is negotiated .
SWS means I will not a call you later , I will not meet your parents , and no , you can't sleep over ( in my t- shirt no less ) .
This is the traditional One Night Stand , folks , it just does n't have to start in a bar , nor do you need to be drunk .
Guys , there are manners .
You do not ejaculate , and instantly ask when the next bus runs outside , a smatter of small talk costs you nothing and might reward you with an upgrade to fuck buddy status .
Also , this is one you DO NOT call later , drunk , horny , and confused .
This is one that is " use once , throw away " .
Unless it 's so good , you have to go back ... usually you can decide this 30 seconds after you cum ... then it 's upgrade time .
Gals .
This is NOT A RELATIONSHIP .
STOP telling your girlfriends about the awesome guy you met last night , he 's not calling you again .
Yes , he used you .
You used him right back .
Enjoy the power .
These are hook ups you do n't talk about , nor do you take them around to meet your pals for drinks the next day .
You hump , they leave .
Simple .
Booty Call :
This is someone you 've SWNS 'ed , or dated .
Maybe you were married .
Or she is , and you work together .
Or you both are .
This is someone you can call anytime , day or night , and chances are , you will get laid .
You have one or two of these , right ?
Everyone does .
Anyone who 's dating someone else , and it's the first year , dreads these .
We all know who are they .
We have ours .
Guys and Gals - these happen FROM previous relationships .
Stop asking for them , you 're putting the horse before the cart .
One of the important things here is , A. , you know calling them is okay , and vice versa , and B. , you know what they 're like in bed , they 're acceptable to you , and there will be no uncomfortable " surprises " at the door if they com over .
Slow it down , Speed Racer , and try SWNS first .
And finally , these are the super , super secret ones .
Nobody ever knows .
Ever .
If you tell your current girlfriend / boyfriend , you destroy the relationship AND the bootycall .
Fuck Buddy .
These are the fun ones , and the most dangerous .
It 's about sex - lots of it , and all the time .
After work , before work , all weekend , in Tahoe on a ski weekend ( fireplace sex is the BEST ) , and they 're allowed to stay over .
Can be ongoing , like a booty call , and will be dusted off between relationships .
" Funny , I never met HIM the 3 years we dated ?
Oh , he 's one of THOSE . "
You might even date , go out , show each other off , but once things get personal , you both know it 's time to split up , for now .
They 're the one person who wo n't get upset if you say " I met someone ... " because they did , too .
Guys and gals , warning .
These relationships are treacherous .
They CAN and do sometimes get real , and the other person rarely agrees it 's time to start sharing the bureau and bathroom .
Be open , honest , and make sure you 're BOTH on the same page , and the kingdom is yours .
However , for the meek at heart , beware .
These are the realtionships where fetishes , fanatsies , and pure unadulterated hedonsim occurs , and it 's expected .
This is the time for her to try drinking the blood from a wound on your lower belly while she jerks you off , because those bloody vampire movies tunr her on in a way she 's not ready to deal with .
This is the time he 'll be into trying threesomes , or more .
Do not be offended if he wants to share you , you are his favorite toy , and it's a mark of honor that he 's comfy with it .
Indulge .
But if they rock your polite , vanilla ideas of what sex is a little too hard , be aware you are in far , far over your head , and you need to back off and either date ( foolish exercise that it is ) or dabble with SWNS , so you can at least escape his / her chamber of horrors .
Yes folks , this is the one where you get your stories .
Love them , live them , respect them .
You 'd both worked hard .
Friends With Benefits .
Yes , that one .
Okay , some blunt truth .
Women tend to abuse this one to try and trap a guy into a relationship , and guys generally confuse this with Fuck Buddy , Booty Call , and Sex With No Strings - and generally all in one night .
Guys , these are going to be tough for you , for one reason : the word " freinds " .
These relationships have a very good shot of turning into a real relationship .
See " When Harry Met Sally " .
This is someone you 'd probably be dating , anyway , and the only difference is no sex .
Adding sex can be tricky , as it moves the relationship into a grey area , of where you 're not sure how you feel .
ORIt 's someone you trust utterly , who can share this intimacy with you without freaking out on you , and it 'll be your shared secret , one that means something .
Yes , guys , sex can be meaningful .
This is one where friendship needs to be present first - a strong friendship that can survive the rocky shore of sexual relations .
If your friendship is rocky , chaotic , inconstant , and does not have solid communication skills on both sides , mutual trust and respect , it 's just a bad idea to begin with , and it will kill your friendship - one that you generally want to cling to , as they count for far more than fleeting sex .
Of all the women I 've had offer this to me , very few of them could handle it , and were confusing the intimacy of freindship with something else .
Two i accepted , one worked , one did 'nt , and horribly .
The three I offered it to , I knew could , and it was a warm , enjoyable experience we still smile about and hint at when our SO 's are n't around .
These are good for times of stress or tradgedy , for the lean times between relationships , and while they tend to be more about married sex than the wild , unbridled fuck buddies , it 's very , very good - you know each other , it 's that much deeper .
Gals : this is a bad way to find a boyfreind .
If he 's already a freind , that means you do n't want to date him , or you 're not sure .
Make up your mind before plunging in .
If you have any feelings for him , and do n't admit it up front , it wo n't go well .
Do n't dupe a guy - we hate that .
Do n't lie .
You cannot ASK for this on CL - they are bred during real freindships that happen outside of your nasty little weekend adventures .
( You nasty little girl .
Bless you . )
Asking for a Freinds With Benefits on CL screams one thing to me ; someone who cannot be honest about what they 're looking for , and is using his / her sexuality , or the lure of it , to bypass the hard work of actually meeting someone , getting to know them , and actually relating to them on various levels .
You belong in Casual Encounters , but you need to get real - what you need and all you can handle is a SWNS or a fuck buddy , stop trying to trick people with the lure of sex .
Guys :
This is trouble for you , for that " freind " word .
Yes , it means you have to be a friend , and all that implies .
That means she CAN in fact call you when she 's weepy , and you have to listen .
That means you 're NICE to her , and do nice things for her .
It may have even occured to her that you really like her , which is why you 're friends with her .
This is one you introduce to your family , if they do n't know her and adore her already , but as just friends - they 'll understand later if that changes .
It also means that you wo n't be having sex all the time - you 're freinds , remember ?
That means doing things with her , like going to the store with her , getting her medicine and soup when she 's sick , driving her when her car is in the shop ... you know the drill .
if any of this irks you , you 're not being honest about her , and you need to figure out what you 're doing , or negotiate for a different status .
So , that 's all for now .
Please post with care , about what you want and are looking for , chances are there 's plenty of someones to fill your every - and I mean every - need , here in the wilds of CL .
But be honest , and get your terms rights .
If you want a boyfriend , post in WSM , not casual encounters talking about friends with benefits .
Do n't agree to a night of SWNS sex and old black and white films , and then start acting like a girlfriend later , and demanding attention .
It 's a waste of time , and that 's time you could be humping .
Hope this helps !
Feel free to rebutt , reject , or rejoinder !
From the very beginning , the conflict between religion and modern science was couched in extreme , even apocalyptic rhetoric .
Thomas H Huxley , who popularised the Origin of Species , insisted that people had to choose between faith and science ; there could be no compromise : " One or the other would have to succumb after a struggle of unknown duration . "
In response , conservative Christians launched a crusade against Darwinism .
After the first world war , the Democratic politician William Jennings Bryan claimed that there was a direct link between evolutionary theory and German militarism : the notion that only the strong could or should survive had " laid the foundation for the bloodiest war in history .
The same science that manufactured poisoned gases to suffocate soldiers is preaching that man has a brutal ancestry . "
The struggle continues - nowhere more so than among the Christian right in the US , who still regard the evolutionary hypothesis as surrounded by a murderous nimbus of evil .
In 1925 , they tried to ban the teaching of evolution in public schools and developed creation science , based on a literal reading of the first chapter of Genesis .
More recently , they have tried to introduce into the school curriculum the teaching of intelligent design ( ID ) , which claims that the irreducible complexity of micro-organisms could not have evolved naturally but must be the result of a single creative act .
The issue splits the nation down the middle : fundamentalists want to win a battle for God ; liberals and secularists are fighting for truth and rationality .
The same passions are likely to be aroused by President Bush 's decision last week to veto the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act , which would have loosened the restrictions on federal funding for stem cell research .
" This bill would support the taking of innocent human life in the hope of finding medical benefits for others , " Bush said .
" It crosses a moral boundary that our decent society needs to respect . "
His opponents point out that while the president zealously champions the rights of the unborn , he is less concerned about the plight of existing American children .
The US infant mortality rate is only the 42nd best in the world ; the average baby has a better chance of surviving in Havana or Beijing ; infant mortality rates are unacceptably high among those who cannot afford adequate healthcare , especially in the African - American community .
And , finally , at the same time as Bush decided to veto the stem cell bill , Israeli bombs were taking the lives of hundreds of innocent Lebanese civilians , many of them children , with the tacit approval of the US .
Is there a connection between a religiously motivated mistrust of science , glaring social injustice and a war in the Middle East ?
Bush and his administration espouse many of the ideals of the Christian right and rely on its support .
American fundamentalists are convinced that the second coming of Christ is at hand ; they have developed an end - time scenario of genocidal battles based on a literal reading of Revelation that is absolutely central to their theology .
Christ cannot return , however , unless , in fulfilment of biblical prophecy , the Jews are in possession of the Holy Land .
Before the End , the faithful will be " raptured " or snatched up into the air in order to avoid the Tribulation .
Antichrist will massacre Jews who are not baptised ; but Christ will defeat the mysterious " enemy from the north " , and establish a millennium of peace .
This grim eschatology , developed in the late 19th century , was in part a reaction to the " social gospel " of the more liberal Christians , who believed that human beings were naturally evolving towards perfection and could build the New Jerusalem here on earth by fighting social injustice .
The fundamentalists , however , believed that God was so angry with the faithless world that he could save it only by initiating a devastating catastrophe ; they would see the terrible battles of the first world war , which showed that science could be used to lethal effect in the new military technology , as the beginning of the End .
The fundamentalists ' rejection of science is deeply linked to their apocalyptic vision .
Even the relatively sober ID theorists segue easily into Rapture - speak .
" Great shakings and darkness are descending on Planet Earth , " says the ID philosopher Paul Nelson , " but they will be overshadowed by even more amazing displays of God 's power and light .
Ever the long - term strategist , YHVH is raising up a mighty army of cutting - edge Jewish End - time warriors . "
They all condemn the attempt to reform social ills .
When applied socially , evolutionary theory " leads straight to all the woes of modern life " , says the leading ID ideologue Philip Johnson : homosexuality , state - backed healthcare , divorce , single - parenthood , socialism and abortion .
All this , of course , is highly agreeable to the Bush administration , which is itself selectively leery of science .
It has , for example , persistently ignored scientists ' warnings about global warming .
Why bother to implement the Kyoto treaty if the world is about to end ?
Indeed , some fundamentalists see environmental damage as a positive development , because it will hasten the apocalypse .
This nihilistic religiosity is based on a perversion of the texts .
The first chapter of Genesis was never intended as a literal account of the origins of life ; it is a myth , a timeless story about the sanctity of the world and everything in it .
Revelation was not a detailed programme for the End time ; it is written in an apocalyptic genre that has quite a different dynamic .
When they described the Jews ' return to their homeland , the Hebrew prophets were predicting the end of the Babylonian exile in the sixth century BC - not the second coming of Christ .
The prophets did preach a stern message of social justice , however , and like all the major world faiths , Christianity sees charity and loving - kindness as the cardinal virtues .
Fundamentalism nearly always distorts the tradition it is trying to defend .
Whatever Bush 's personal beliefs , the ideology of the Christian right is both familiar and congenial to him .
This strange amalgam of ideas can perhaps throw light on the behaviour of a president , who , it is said , believes that God chose him to lead the world to Rapture , who has little interest in social reform , and whose selective concern for life issues has now inspired him to veto important scientific research .
It explains his unconditional and uncritical support for Israel , his willingness to use " Jewish End- time warriors " to fulfil a vision of his own - arguably against Israel 's best interests - and to see Syria and Iran ( who seem to be replacing Saddam as the " enemy of the north " ) as entirely responsible for the unfolding tragedy .
Fundamentalists do not want a humanly constructed peace ; many , indeed , regard the UN as the abode of Antichrist .
The willingness of the US to turn a blind eye to the suffering of innocent people in Lebanon will certainly fuel the rage of the extremists and lead to further acts of terror .
We can only hope that it does not take us all the way to Armageddon .

irb -r irb / completion
irb is the interactive Ruby shell - an incredibly useful tool during development .
Lisp folks are proud of the REPL ( Read - Evaluate - Print Loop ) - well , irb is REPL for Ruby .
What turns irb into an even more useful instrument , however , is tab completion .
First , it makes coding quicker by completing known symbols ( kind of an Intellisense , if you 'd like ) .
Second , and more importantly , it allows you to quickly see which methods are implemented for objects , by typing :
And pressing TAB twice , irb will list all the methods .
For some reason , however , irb does n't come with tab completion out of the box .
To set it up , you can create a batch file called irbb.bat , for instance , which calls :
And call that instead of irb .
A simpler method , IMHO , is directly edit the irb.bat file in the Ruby installation bin / directory toirb / completion .
P.S : I describe Windows solutions .
It should be very similar for Linux .
Air New Zealand and airliner manufacturer Boeing are secretly working with Blenheim - based biofuel developer Aquaflow Bionomic Corporation to create the world 's first environmentally friendly aviation fuel , made of wild algae .
If the project pans out the small and relatively new New Zealand company could lead the world in environmentally sustainable aviation fuel .
It 's understood Air NZ is undertaking risk analysis .
If everything stacks up it will make an aircraft available on the Tasman to test the biofuel .
The fuel is essentially derived from bacterial pond scum created through the photosynthesis of sunlight and carbon dioxide on nutrient - rich water sources such as sewage ponds .
Air NZ would most likely test the fuel on one engine while normal aviation fuel would drive the other engine .
Fuel is held in cells on the aircraft that can be directed to a specific engine .
None of the parties involved will talk about the joint venture development because of confidentiality agreements but whispers about the project were circulating at the roll - out of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner in Seattle in the US last week .
Local Marlborough media reported a visit by Boeing to Aquaflow earlier this year and Boeing has stated publicly since then that it believes algae is the airline fuel of the future .
Virgin Fuels announced in April it was working with Boeing to demonstrate biofuel in a 747-400 .
The focus is on testing algae - derived jet fuel , especially its freezing point .
Boeing 's Dave Daggett was reported this year as saying algae ponds totalling 34,000 square kilometres could produce enough fuel to reduce the net CO2 footprint for all of aviation to zero .
Until now the relatively new Blenheim company 's focus has been on biodiesel for cars , trucks , buses and boats .
Environment Minister David Parker drew public attention to the company in December when he test drove a Land Rover around Parliament 's forecourt that was powered by Aquaflow 's blend of algae biofuel and diesel ( 5 % algae fuel and 95 % conventional fuel ) just a year after it was developed .
Virgin Airline boss Richard Branson met Parker in January to discuss biofuel , including Aquaflow 's technology for wild algae .
Aquaflow director Vicki Buck said yesterday that she could n't talk about any ventures with anyone because to do so would compromise projects on the drawing board .
But she did say a $ 5 million capital - raising had been successful and the company now had a major international cornerstone shareholder .
The company had also received $ 90,000 of funding from the Foundation for Research , Science and Technology and would seek further funding for the commercialisation of its technology later this year .
Buck said Aquaflow had been inundated with inquiries from around the world since Parker 's test drive .
Aquaflow was recently invited to join the highly regarded Girvan Institute of Technology in Silicon Valley .
Besides Buck , a former Christchurch mayor , its major shareholders are technology expert Nick Gerritsen and Barrie Leay .
The company , formed in October 2005 , began operating in May last year after it met a request from the local council to deal with excess algae on sewage ponds .
Aquaflow created technology to harvest the sewage pond algae and chemically extract fatty lipids for fuel .
There is one major web rendering engine that grew entirely out of the open source world : KHTML is KDE 's web renderer which was built from the ground up by the open source community with very little original corporate backing .
The code was good and branches were born as a result , the best known being Webkit .
Now , after years of split , KHTML and Webkit are coming together once again .
KHTML was introduced to the world as part of KDE 2.0 , a milestone release within the KDE community that included Konqueror , KDE 's integrated KHTML - powered web browser and file manager .
It was launched in a time when Netscape was failing , and the Mozilla Foundation was still struggling to build a community around the released Netscape source code .
At the time , the rendering was decent for 90 % of all HTML you could throw at it , but had limited support for JavaScript and other features that were emerging at the time .
A good first start , though , which did not go unnoticed by the software world at large .
One of the first projects to pick up KHTML for use outside of KDE was AtheOS ( now known as Syllable ) , which abstracted KHTML to produce their own web browser , known as Abrowse .
KDE did not know at the time that the interest was actually much higher .
Apple took a fork of KHTML and worked privately on its own branch of it for years , abstracting the KDE and Qt specific code until they produced Webkit for the purposes of powering Safari .
In that time , KHTML and Webkit grew apart .
By the time Apple had launched the first public releases of Safari , its improvements had become difficult to move back into KHTML .
Apple also had an interesting time trying to discover how to work within the open source community within which they derived their code .
Flame wars erupted and settled down .
Some of the KHTML coders were granted access to Webkit 's source tree and for a while , we all lived peacefully with one another .
But Apple was n't the only interested party .
Nokia took a fork of Webkit to power their mobile browsers ( citing reduced memory and performance requirements , as well as clean code ) .
They produced a fork that was adjusted to use GTK , but it was a fork nonetheless .
They also have a separate implementation of Webkit that is seen in their Series 60 mobile phone , which is estimated to have a distribution of 10 million devices .
Other companies have started to develop Webkit or KHTML forks internally as well , although they tend to more frequently start their fork from Webkit due to the code already having been abstracted .
On top of that , Webkit - derived browsers are starting to get a good share of the browser market either via their near monopoly of Mac surfers , or the use of Webkit on cell phones .
While there were some previous efforts to make a KHTML or Webkit browser on Windows , Apple 's decision to release Safari on Windows will really drive up website compatibility .
Web developers are starting to pay attention to compatibility standards ( thanks largely in part to the declining market for Internet Explorer ) and programming for Webkit is fairly easy if you program for the web standards .
However , the developers ' fear of continued forking is starting to pull on some of the various involved entities , with Apple increasingly making overtures to those using Webkit to send their improvements upstream .
The problem is that upstream from Apple is really KDE , which contains the original code that has not been abstracted at all .
Recently Abrowse , one of the first KHTML derivative browsers switched over to Webkit to take advantage of its rising market share and improved website compatibility .
GNOME 's Epiphany browser also recently implemented the ability to use Webkit as its rendering core .
Well , this is a tide that KDE is having trouble swimming against .
During the Akademy 2007 developer conference in Glasgow , several KDE developers sat down to help decide a reasonable course of action with regard to Webkit and KHTML .
During the keynote delivered by Trolltech 's Lars Knoll , it was revealed that the company was working on bringing Webkit into Qt proper which has encouraged KDE to play its hand .
The decision had to be made as to whether to stick with the home grown KHTML , or move to Webkit , KHTML 's fully grown offspring .
As with many decisions in the open source community , this decision was not made by an open vote , but by consensus .
In this case , the debate flared up at a Glasgow pub where the developers were free and open to speak their minds .
While there are still a few reservations , the consensus is to develop a Webkit KPart for embedding into Konqueror at the earliest opportunity and to take a more active role in the development of Webkit itself .
This was hinted at earlier in an Ars interview with Lars Knoll , but now it is more or less the official word .
Now , KHTML wo n't be deleted right away since there are features in it that need to be ported into Webkit .
For example , KHTML ( in KDE 4 ) implements portions of the definition of the CSS3 standard , which will need to be adopted into Webkit and so forth .
But the big deal is that the coders that invented the underlying layers that power Konqueror , some Nokia browsers , Abrowse , Safari , Adobe 's Air , and now Epiphany and a few other projects that are in the works , are now back in the fold .
Additionally , Trolltech has announced that they are including Webkit in their upcoming Qt 4.4 release which means that a major , cross - platform toolkit now permits anyone to use the Webkit rendering engine where ever they need to render some HTML .
In open source terms , this may be as big of a deal as the gcc and egcs merger of yonder days .
KHTML and Webkit are definitely coming of age .
The KDE developers , responsible for the original creation of KHTML , are dedicated to seeing this unforking happen and are taking a leading role in that effort .
In related news , some Webkit developers are planning a ( still unannounced ) logo design competition .
This should pit the best of everyone ranging from Apple 's community artists to those in the open source world against each other .
May the best logo win !
Robert Gates is said to be preparing to discuss the plans in Saudi Arabia
Defence officials quoted by US media said the sales would include advanced weaponry , missile guidance systems , upgraded fighter jets and naval ships .
It is said to be an attempt to counter the regional threat posed by Iran .
The officials said the secretaries of state and defence would discuss the deal on a visit to the Gulf next week .
However , discussions with Congress on the arms package have just begun , and no announcements are expected during the visit , the officials added .
Israeli ' concern '
On Saturday , the New York Times and the Washington Post quoted unnamed senior US officials as saying the Bush administration was preparing to an arms sale package for a number of US allies in the Gulf .
The proposed deal for Saudi Arabia reportedly includes air - to - air missiles , advanced precision - guided bombs , upgrades to its fighters and new naval vessels .
The role of the Sunni Arab neighbours is to send a positive , affirmative message to moderates in Iraq in government that the neighbours are with you
US State Department official
To counter objections by Israel and its supporters in Congress , the officials said the Jewish state would be offered significantly increased military aid .
The White House is also said to be concerned that the package may prompt critics of the Saudi government in Congress to oppose it because of concerns about the kingdom 's influence in Iraq .
Other US allies in the Gulf - Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar and the United Arab Emirates - could receive equipment and weaponry as part of the deal , the officials said
The officials said the arms deal aimed to bolster the militaries of the Sunni Arab states as part of a strategy to counter what it sees as a growing threat posed by Iran in the region .
" The role of the Sunni Arab neighbours is to send a positive , affirmative message to moderates in Iraq in government that the neighbours are with you , " a senior State Department official told the New York Times on Friday .
Defence Secretary Robert Gates is said to be planning to discuss the proposals in a visit to Saudi Arabia next week with the Secretary of State , Condoleezza Rice .
Officials said Mr Gates would also reassure the Saudis that his country 's commitment to the region remained steadfast regardless of what happens in Iraq in the short term .
Sony should win a lifetime achievement award for its efforts to help raise consumer awareness about the problems inherent in DRM technology .
It seems like every time the company attempts to “ innovate ’ in the area of DRM the effort backfires in a manner that ends up demonstrating just how bad DRM can really be .
Sony ’s latest misadventure involves recently released DVD titles that are reportedly unplayable on a number of widely available DVD players , including several of the company ’s own models .
The problem originally gained attention on an Amazon forum when consumers began to compare notes about their inability to view the film Stranger Than Fiction .
Initially Sony denied there was a problem .
Technicians at the company ’s consumer help line explained that Sony had implemented a new form of DVD copy protection and that it was up to the manufacturers of individual DVD players to upgrade their firmware .
The same Sony help technicians also explained that there was no timetable for the release of a firmware update that would allow Sony DVD players to play the new Sony DVDs .
It was n’t so long ago that Sony ran into problems when it attempted to protect standard audio CDs with a new copy protection scheme .
As DRM disasters go , the Sony rootkit fiasco was a bad idea to begin with .
With only a few exceptions consumers have never had to deal with DRM on audio CDs .
Thanks to Sony , it ’s likely that we ’ll never see widespread implementation of DRM on standard audio discs .
DRM on DVDs is quite a bit different , however .
As Steve Jobs notes , video content has always been copy protected .
While the Content Scramble System ( CSS ) does n’t actually protect DVD content , at least the protection scheme works across devices manufactured by different companies .
Sony has essentially managed to break one of the few DRM systems that is relatively device independent .
In the process , they ’ve probably enlightened more than a few consumers about the problems of DRM — consumers who may never have thought seriously about the issue otherwise .
If there ’s a punch line to this story , it ’s this : Several SlashDot readers reported that they were able to view the DVDs by using widely available DVD ripping software to transfer the disc content to their PCs .
That ’s right , Sony ’s new DRM system is incompatible with some Sony DVD players AND it is does nothing to prevent users from ripping the content to an unencrypted digital format .
Talk about worthless technology .
As a final note , yesterday Sony apparently admitted that this whole issue is the result of a recent update to a secondary DRM system that the company uses in addition to the standard CSS copy protection system .
Sony will apparently be modifying ( and hopefully testing ) the secondary DRM system .
The company has indicated it will be replacing discs that consumers are unable to view .
Feb. 12 , 2007  -- " Quantum Computing . "
It 's one of those things that bring a sparkle to the eyes of propellerheads -- and make the rest of us just scratch our heads .
But it 's been a holy grail in the arcane world of supercomputers -- and a Canadian firm claims it will be unveiling one on Tuesday .
Nevermind that most engineers thought quantum computers were decades away .
D- Wave Systems , Inc. , based near Vancouver , is the company that 's been working on the project .
Its machine is described as a computer that can perform 64,000 calculations at once .
Following the odd laws of quantum mechanics , the digital " bits " that race through its circuits will be able to stand for 0 or 1 at the same time , allowing the machine , eventually , to do work that is orders of magnitude more complex than what today 's computers can do .
" There are certain classes of problems that can't be solved with digital computers , " said Herb Martin , the firm 's CEO , over a decidedly - noisy digital cell phone .
" Digital computers are good at running programs ; quantum computers are good at handling massive sets of variables . "
Coming Soon to a Store Near You ?
So will you or I be able to have one soon ?
Will it come as a laptop ?
The answers , for now , are no , and no .
The current prototype , says Martin , is as big as a good - sized freezer , and a lot colder .
It uses superconducting circuits that have to be refrigerated , close to absolute zero .
That 's the kind of temperature at which electrical resistance fades nearly to nothing ( think of the heat generated by a conventional laptop ) , so that massive calculations can be done .
What sorts ?
Martin says , for instance , that a quantum computer could be used to design genetically based drugs ( remember that the DNA in every human cell has 3 billion " base pairs , " or " rungs " on that famous helical ladder ) .
Or it could be used by companies to manage their supply chains .
" Think , " says Martin , " of a company that has 40 factories and makes a million different parts .
That 's a lot to keep track of . "
Quantum computers could also have major uses in the security world .
Since 9/11 , governments and companies have gotten heavily into biometrics , building massive databases of pictures , fingerprints , and other complex measures of people they want to track .
If someone on a terrorism watch list passes a security checkpoint at an airport , a quantum computer could presumably be very fast at comparing his or her picture to the massive databases of pictures stored by security agencies .
Reality Check
Will this actually happen any time soon ?
Much of the computing world is skeptical .
Major companies , such as IBM and NEC , have done years of research without results so far .
Even Seth Lloyd of MIT , a computer scientist whose research is cited as a major source of D - Wave 's work , has been quoted as saying that while he 's happy they 're trying , he 'll wait to see what they 've done .
So do n't go online in search of a quantum machine any time soon .
But do n't be surprised if , at some time in the future , you can go online to a search engine which just happens to be powered by this very strange technology .

The Duke rape case had the makings of a front - page news story from the very start .
The allegations were shocking and the underlying facts were salacious enough to result in the predictable media frenzy that followed .
It seemed everyone had an opinion , shaped in large part by preexisting presumptions .
Long before any exculpatory evidence had surfaced , criminal defense attorneys were eager to point out minor inconsistencies in the case against the lacrosse players while victims ’ advocates decried the horrible accusations and steadfastly supported the accuser ’s version of events to the very end , despite mounting evidence to the contrary .
Last week , after the dismissal of the charges against the three students , some media outlets did something that was rarely done in the past :
They released the accuser ’s name .
As a result , in the wake of this high profile case , some have called for the media to end its long - standing policy of refusing to release the names of complainants in all sexual assault cases .
What I found to be the most bizarre rationale offered by some proponents of this change is that the current practice of keeping a victim ’s identity secret actually reinforces the idea that the victim should feel guilty and hide in shame behind the veil of anonymity .
This assertion ignores the fact that the inherent nature of this class of crimes is different from all others .
To suggest that splashing a sexual assault victim ’s name and image across the front pages of newspapers could somehow be an empowering act is nothing short of ridiculous .
More importantly , however , is that those who propose naming future victims suggest the option for all the wrong reasons .
The underlying assumption of this proposal is that the accuser ’s false allegations in the Duke rape case are the sole reason for the travesty of justice that occurred .
For this theory to hold water , it must be true that people rarely lie , therefore the threat of exposing the identities of sexual assault victims is a sure fire way to weed out false claims .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
During my tenure as a Monroe County assistant public defender , I learned that people lie all the time .
People twist the truth to their advantage regardless of which side of the case they ’re on .
I ’ve seen complainants bring patently false accusations against ex-boyfriends and I ’ve seen defendants insist they ’re innocent of the charges against them in spite of damning video evidence .
I ’ve seen lawyers on both sides of a criminal case engage in somewhat questionable behavior , and I ’ve seen judges do the same .
We are all human and humans are fallible .
Despite having such knowledge , I ’ve always had faith in the criminal justice system .
If everyone is doing their job , the truth , or something close to it , generally prevails , although there are certainly exceptions to that rule .
A key element in that equation requires those charged with upholding the law , including prosecuting attorneys , to act ethically and responsibly .
A good prosecutor is an excellent judge of character .
A good prosecutor seeks justice , not convictions , in each and every case she handles , is selfless and does not seek personal gain from the cases he prosecutes .
And , most importantly , a good prosecutor exercises prosecutorial discretion in a fair and judicious manner .
By most accounts , Mike Nifong , the district attorney in the Duke rape case , was anything but a good prosecutor .
He placed his political ambitions ahead of his duty to seek truth and justice .
Had he waited until all of the evidence was in before he discussed the case with the media — and certainly before indicting those young men — then their lives would not have been ruined .
Nifong ’s failure to exercise discretion in the prosecution of this case caused untold harm .
Without question , a travesty of justice occurred , in large part because Nifong rushed to judgment for purely selfish reasons .
However , one prosecutor ’s failure should not result in the exposure of future victims of sexual assault to public humiliation and embarrassment .
To do so would discourage future victims from reporting sexual assaults and allow assailants to get away with their crimes time and time again , which would be a travesty of justice , indeed .

Here 's a video that sums up the case in 7 minutes or so :
Originally published in 1994 , this article pre-dates “ Agile ” as a named thing .
It was written out of a culture that was critiquing authoritarian and factory - oriented approaches to software development .
It was that culture which resulted in Scrum , Extreme Programming , Agile , and also my own approach to software testing , Rapid Software Testing , which in ’ 94 was still a year away from being taught under the name “ Market - Driven Software Testing . ”
Although I have met a few CMM consultants who rose above their material , such as the great Judah Mogilensky , they did so , in my opinion , despite the CMM instead of because of it .
My conversations with them led me to understand that they were working in a culture that needed the imprimatur of authority in order take process improvement seriously .
They had made their peace with that .
I could not .
I think if you are using the CMM , you have already kind of abandoned taking software process seriously , since you have to think within that model , and that model is dead wrong ( although as an issue list it may have some value , as I say at the end ) .
I came to that opinion not only based on my experience ( I have 25 more years of that now , and during this time Agile has risen and taken over ) , but based on the obvious : that not a shred of actual evidence , nor any credible theoretical framework had been advanced in support of this smothering thing called the CMM .
The Capability Maturity Model has no more basis to it than Galenic medicine with its humors .
Basically some fussy managers got together and packaged their assumptions and preconceptions about engineering , which , unencumbered by the dead weight of field research or critical thinking , could soar with the neckties .
( Then Agile came along and fired most of the managers . )
Almost nobody among my clients ever talks about the CMM , now .
So why am I re-posting this ?
I ’m re-posting because in 1994 I was young and unknown and right about something and willing to fight over it .
It feels good to remember that .
Also , I ’m posting this because , though I have my problems with Agile culture , too , at least it understands a lot about people and how they work .
The Software Engineering Institute ’s ( SEI ) Capability Maturity Model ( CMM ) gets a lot of publicity .
Given that the institute is funded by the US Department of Defense to the tune of tens of millions of dollars each year [ 1 ] , this should come as no surprise– the folks at the SEI are the official process mavens of the military , and have the resources to spread the word about what they do .
But , given also that the CMM is a broad , and increasingly deep , set of assertions as to what constitutes good software development practice , it ’s reasonable to ask where those assertions come from , and whether they are in fact complete and correct .
My thesis , in this essay , is that the CMM is a particular mythology of software process evolution that cannot legitimately claim to be a natural or essential representation of software processes .
The CMM is at best a consensus among a particular group of software engineering theorists and practitioners concerning a collection of effective practices grouped according to a simple model of organizational evolution .
As such , it is potentially valuable for those companies that completely lack software savvy , or for those who have a lot of it and thus can avoid its pitfalls .
At worst , the CMM is a whitewash that obscures the true dynamics of software engineering , suppresses alternative models .
If an organization follows it for its own sake , rather than simply as a requirement mandated by a particular government contract , it may very well lead to the collapse of that company ’s competitive potential .
For these reasons , the CMM is unpopular among many of the highly competitive and innovative companies producing commercial shrink - wrap software .
A short description of the CMM
The CMM [ 7 ] was conceived by Watts Humphrey , who based it on the earlier work of Phil Crosby .
Active development of the model by the SEI began in 1986 .
It consists of a group of “ key practices ” , neither new nor unique to CMM , which are divided into five levels representing the stages that organizations should go through on the way to becoming “ mature ” .
The SEI has defined a rigorous process assessment method to appraise how well a organization satisfies the goals associated with each level .
The assessment is supposed to be led by an authorized lead assessor .
The maturity levels are :
1. Initial ( chaotic , ad hoc , heroic )
2. Repeatable ( project management , process discipline )
3. Defined ( institutionalized )
4. Managed ( quantified )
5. Optimizing ( process improvement )
One way companies are supposed to use the model is first to assess their maturity level and then form a specific plan to get to the next level .
Skipping levels is not allowed .
The CMM was originally meant as a tool to evaluate the ability of government contractors to perform a contracted software project .
It may be suited for that purpose ; I do n’t know .
My concern is that it is also touted as a general model for software process improvement .
In that application , the CMM has serious weaknesses .
Shrink - wrap companies , which have also been called commercial off - the - shelf firms or software package firms , include Borland , Claris , Apple , Symantec , Microsoft , and Lotus , among others .
Many such companies rarely if ever manage their requirements documents as formally as the CMM describes .
This is a requirement to achieve level 2 , and so all of these companies would probably fall into level 1 of the model .
Criticism of the CMM
A comprehensive survey of criticism of the CMM is outside the scope of this article .
However , Capers Jones and Gerald Weinberg are two noteworthy critics .
In his book Assessment & Control of Software Risks [ 6 ] , Jones discusses his own model , Software Productivity Research ( SPR ) , which was developed independently from CMM at around the same time and competes with it today .
Jones devotes a chapter to outlining the weaknesses of the CMM .
SPR accounts for many factors that the CMM currently ignores , such as those contributing to the productivity of individual engineers .
In the two volumes of his Quality Software Management series [ 12,13 ] , Weinberg takes issue with the very concept of maturity as applied to software processes , and instead suggests a paradigm based on patterns of behavior .
Weinberg models software processes as interactions between humans , rather than between formal constructs .
His approach suggests an evolution of “ problem - solving leadership ” rather than canned processes .
General problems with CMM
I do n’t have the space to expand fully on all the problems I see in the CMM .
Here are the biggest ones from my point of view as a process specialist in the shrink - wrap world :
The CMM has no formal theoretical basis .
It ’s based on the experience of “ very knowledgeable people ” .
Hence , the de facto underlying theory seems to be that experts know what they ’re doing .
According to such a principle , any other model based on experiences of other knowledgeable people has equal veracity .
The CMM has only vague empirical support .
That is , the empirical support for CMM could also be construed to support other models .
The model is based mainly on experience of large government contractors , and Watts Humphrey ’s own experience in the mainframe world .
It does not account for the success of shrink - wrap companies , and levels 1 , 4 , and 5 are not well represented in the data : the first because it is misrepresented , the latter two because there are so few organizations at those levels .
The SEI ’s , Mark Paulk can cite numerous experience reports supporting CMM , and he tells me that a formal validation study is underway .
That ’s all well and good , but the anecdotal reports I ’ve seen and heard regarding success using the CMM could be interpreted as evidence for the success of people working together to achieve anything .
In other words , without a comparison of alternative process models under controlled conditions , the empirical case can never be closed .
On the contrary , the case is kept wide open by ongoing counterexamples in the form of successful level 1 organizations , and by the curious lack of data regarding failures of the CMM ( which may be due to natural reluctance on the part of companies to dwell on their mistakes , or of the SEI to record them ) .

The CMM reveres process , but ignores people .
This is readily apparent to anyone who is familiar with the work of Gerald Weinberg , for whom the problems of human interaction define engineering .
By contrast , both Humphrey and CMM mention people in passing [ 5 ] , but both also decry them as unreliable and assume that defined processes can somehow render individual excellence less important .
The idea that process makes up for mediocrity is a pillar of the CMM , wherein humans are apparently subordinated to defined processes .
But , where is the justification for this ?
To render excellence less important the problem solving tasks would somehow have to be embodied in the process itself .
I ’ve never seen such a process , but if one exists , it would have to be quite complex .
Imagine a process definition for playing a repeatably good chess game .
Such a process exists , but is useful only to computers ; a process useful to humans has neither been documented nor taught as a series of unambiguous steps .
Are n’t software problems at least as complex as chess problems ?
The CMM reveres institutionalization of process for its own sake .
Since the CMM is principally concerned with an organization ’s ability to commit , such a bias is understandable .
But , an organization ’s ability to commit is merely an expression of a project team ’s ability to execute .
Even if necessary processes are not institutionalized formally , they may very well be in place , informally , by virtue of the skill of the team members .
Institutionalization guarantees nothing , and efforts to institutionalize often lead to a bifurcation between an oversimplified public process and a rich private process that must be practiced undercover .
Even if institutionalization is useful , why not instead institutionalize a system for identifying and keeping key contributors in the organization , and leave processes up to them ?
The CMM contains very little information on process dynamics .
This makes it confusing to discuss the relationship between practices and levels with a CMM proponent , because of all the hidden assumptions .
For instance , why is n’t training on level 1 instead ?
Training is especially important at level 1 , where it may take the form of mentoring or of generic training in any of the skills of software engineering .
The answer seems to be that nothing is placed at level 1 , because level 1 is defined merely as not being at level 2 .
The hidden assumption here is that who we are , what problems we face , and what we ’re already doing does n’t matter : just get to level 2 .
In other words , the CMM does n’t perceive or adapt to the conditions of the client organization .
Therefore , training or any other informal practice at level 1 , no matter how effective it is , could be squashed accidentally by a blind and static CMM .
Another example :
Why is defect prevention a level 5 practice ?
We use project post mortems at Borland to analyze and improve our processes — is n’t that a form of defect prevention ?
There are many such examples I could cite , based on a reading of the CMM 1.1 document ( although I did not review the voluminous Key Practices document ) and the appendix of Humphrey ’s Managing the Software Process [ 5 ] .
Basically , most and perhaps all of the key practices could be performed usefully at level 1 , depending on the particular dynamics of the particular organization .
Instead of actually modeling those process dynamics , the way Weinberg does in his work , the CMM merely stratifies them .

The CMM encourages displacement of goals from the true mission of improving process to the artificial mission of achieving a higher maturity level .
I call this “ level envy ” , and it generally has the effect of blinding an organization to the most effective use of its resources .
The SEI itself recognizes this as a problem and has taken some steps to correct it .
The problem is built in to the very structure of the model , however , and will be very hard to exorcise .
Feet of clay :
The CMM ’s fundamental misunderstanding of level 1 Organizations
The world of technology thrives best when individuals are left alone to be different , creative , and disobedient .
— Don Valentine , Silicon Valley Venture Capitalist [ 8 ]
Apart from the concerns mentioned above , the most powerful argument against the CMM as an effective prescription for software processes is the many successful companies that , according the CMM , should not exist .
This point is most easily made against the backdrop of the Silicon Valley .
Tom Peters ’s , Thriving on Chaos [ 9 ] , amounts to a manifesto for Silicon Valley .
It places innovation , non-linearity , ongoing revolution at the center of its world view .
Here in the Valley , innovation reigns supreme , and it is from the vantage point of the innovator that the CMM seems most lost .
Personal experience at Apple and Borland , and contact with many others in the decade I ’ve spent here , support this view .
Proponents of the CMM commonly mistake its critics as being anti-process , and some of us are .
But a lot of us , including me , are process specialists .
We believe in the kinds of processes that support innovation .
Our emphasis is on systematic problem - solving leadership to enable innovation , rather than mere process control to enable cookie - cutter solutions .
Innovation per se does not appear in the CMM at all , and it is only suggested by level 5 .
This is shocking , in that the most innovative firms in the software industry , ( e.g. , General Magic , a pioneer in personal digital communication technology ) operate at level 1 , according to the model .
This includes Microsoft , too , and certainly Borland [ 2 ] .
Yet , in terms of the CMM , these companies are considered no different than any failed startup or paralyzed steel company .
By contrast , companies like IBM , which by all accounts has made a real mess of the Federal Aviation Administration ’s Advanced Automation Project , score high in terms of maturity ( according to a member of a government audit team with whom I spoke ) .
Now , the SEI argues that innovation is outside of its scope , and that the CMM merely establishes a framework within which innovation may more freely occur .
According to the literature of innovation , however , nothing could be further from the truth .
Preoccupied with predictability , the CMM is profoundly ignorant of the dynamics of innovation .
Such dynamics are documented in Thriving on Chaos , Reengineering the Corporation [ 4 ] , and The Fifth Discipline [ 10 ] , three well known books on business innovation .
Where innovators advise companies to get flexible , the CMM advises them to get predictable .
Where the innovators suggest pushing authority down in the organization , the CMM pushes it upward .
Where the innovators recommend constant constructive innovation , the CMM mistakes it for chaos at level 1 .
Where the innovators depend on a trail of learning experiences , the CMM depends on a trail of paper .
Nowhere is the schism between these opposing world - views more apparent than on the matter of heroism .
The SEI regards heroism as an unsustainable sacrifice on the part of particular individuals who have special gifts .
It considers heroism the sole reason that level 1 companies succeed , when they succeed at all .
The heroism more commonly practiced in successful level 1 companies is something much less mystical .
Our heroism means taking initiative to solve ambiguous problems .
This does not mean burning people up and tossing them out , as the SEI claims .
Heroism is a definable and teachable set of behaviors that enhance and honor creativity ( as a unit of United Technologies Microelectronics Center has shown [ 3 ] ) .
It is communication , and mutual respect .
It means the selective deployment of processes , not according to management mandate , but according to the skills of the team .
Personal mastery is at the center of heroism , yet it too has no place in the CMM , except through the institution of a formal training program .
Peter Senge [ 10 ] , has this to say about mastery :
“ There are obvious reasons why companies resist encouraging personal mastery .
It is ‘ soft ’ , based in part on unquantifiable concepts such as intuition and personal vision .
No one will ever be able to measure to three decimal places how much personal mastery contributes to productivity and the bottom line .
In a materialistic culture such as ours , it is difficult even to discuss some of the premises of personal mastery .
‘ Why do people even need to talk about this stuff ? ’ someone may ask .
‘ Is n’t it obvious ?
Do n’t we already know it ? ' ”
This is , I believe , the heart of the problem , and the reason why CMM is dangerous to any company founded upon innovation .
Because the CMM is distrustful of personal contributions , ignorant of the conditions needed to nurture non-linear ideas , and content to bury them beneath a constraining superstructure , achieving level 2 on the CMM scale may very well stamp out the only flame that lit the company to begin with .
I do n’t doubt that such companies become more predictable , in the way that life becomes predictable if we resolve never to leave our beds .
I do doubt that such companies can succeed for long in a dynamic world if they work in their pajamas .
An alternative to CMM
If not the maturity model , then by what framework can we guide genuine process improvement ?
Alternative frameworks can be found in generic form in Thriving on Chaos , which contains 45 “ prescriptions ” , or The Fifth Discipline , which presents –not surprisingly –five disciplines .
The prescriptions of Thriving on Chaos are embodied in an organizational tool called The Excellence Audit , and The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook [ 11 ] , which provides additional guidance in creating learning organizations , is now available .
An advantage of these models is that they provide direction , without mandating a particular shape to the organization .
They actually provide guidance in creating organizational change .
Specific to software engineering , I ’m working on a process model at Borland that consists of a seven - dimensional framework for analyzing problems and identifying necessary processes .
These dimensions are : business factors , market factors , project deliverables , four primary processes ( commitment , planning , implementation , convergence ) , teams , project infrastructure , and milestones .
The framework connects to a set of scaleable “ process cycles ” .
The process cycles are repeatable step by step recipes for performing certain common tasks .
The framework is essentially a situational repository of heuristics for conducting successful projects .
It is meant to be a quick reference to aid experienced practitioners in deciding the best course of action .
The key to this model is that the process cycles are subordinated to the heuristic framework .
The whole thing is an aid to judgment , not a prescription for institutional formalisms .
The structure of the framework , as a set of two - dimensional grids , assists in process tailoring and asking “ what if … ? ”
In terms of this model , maturity means recognizing problems ( through the analysis of experience and use of metrics ) and solving them ( through selective definition and deployment of formal and informal processes ) , and that means developing judgment and cooperation within teams .
Unlike the CMM , there is no a priori declaration either of the problems , or the solutions .
That determination remains firmly in the hands of the team .
The disadvantage of this alternative model is that it ’s more complex , and therefore less marketable .
There are no easy answers , and our progress cannot be plotted on the fingers of one hand .
But we must resist the temptation to turn away from the unmeasurable and sometimes ineffable reality of software innovation .
After all , that would be immature .
Postscript 02/99
In the five years since I wrote this article , neither the CMM situation , nor my assessment of it , has changed much .
The defense industry continues to support the CMM .
Some commercial IT organizations follow it , many others do n’t .
Software companies pursuing the great technological goldrush of our time , the Internet , are ignoring it in droves .
Studies alleging that the CMM is valuable do n’t consider alternatives , and leave out critical data that would allow a full analysis of what ’s going on in companies that claim to have moved up in CMM levels and to have benefited for that reason .
One thing about my opinion has shifted .
I ’ve become more comfortable with the distinction between the CMM philosophy , and the CMM issue list .
As a list of issues worth addressing in the course of software process improvement , the CMM is useful and benign .
I would argue that it ’s incomplete and confusing in places , but that ’s no big deal .
The problem begins when the CMM is adopted as a philosophy for good software engineering .
Still , it has become a lot clearer to me why the CMM philosophy is so much more popular than it deserves to be .
It gives hope , and an illusion of control , to management .
Faced with the depressing reality that software development success is contingent upon so many subtle and dynamic factors and judgments , the CMM provides a step by step plan to do something unsubtle and create something solid .
The sad part is that this step - by - step plan usually becomes a substitute for genuine education in engineering management , and genuine process improvement .
Over the last few years , I ’ve been through Jerry Weinberg ’s classes on management and change artistry : Problem Solving Leadership , and the Change Shop .
I ’ve become a part of his Software Engineering Management Development Group program , and the SHAPE forum .
Information about all of these are available at http://www.geraldmweinberg.com.
In my view , Jerry ’s work continues to offer an excellent alternative to the whole paradigm of the CMM : managers must first learn to see , hear , and think about human systems before they can hope to control them .
Software projects are human systems– deal with it .
One last plug .
Add to your reading list The Logic of Failure , by Dietrich Dorner .
Dorner analyzes how people cope with managing complex systems .
Without mentioning software development or capability maturity , it ’s as eloquent an argument against CMM philosophy as you ’ll find .

Here we present what is arguably the tastiest way to design and learn about electronic circuits : make circuitry snacks !
Two of our favorite things in the world are playing with electronics and playing with food , and so it is about time that someone finally got around to combining the two .
We begin by gathering up appropriate snack - food building blocks and making food - based models of electronic components .
From these components , you can assemble “ circuitry snacks ” – edible models of functioning electronic circuits .
You can make these for fun , for dessert , for your geek friends , for kids , and for teaching and learning electronics .
Let ’s begin by looking at some of the raw materials that are available and the sorts of things that we can make out of them .
We ’ll divide this up into several sections , for the substrates , wiring , and active and passive components .
After that , we ’ll put together a couple of simple circuits : a 555 LED Blinker and a Joule Thief .
Substrates
Graham crackers ( left ) are a good starting point for building up a circuit– use them like circuit boards or perfboard .
You can use icing to glue components down to the circuit board .
You can also use frosting or icing to represent wires or traces on the circuit board .
On the right is a set of blue Pop Tarts with sprinkles : could this be your next set of solar panels ?
You can simulate the green “ solder mask ” layer on printed circuit boards by spraying your graham crackers with aerosol food coloring .
It ’s not particularly pleasant stuff , being spray paint and all .
It leaves your boards slightly moist to the touch and the green powder that is deposited rubs off easily .
None the less , it does look the part .
Advanced technique ( not shown ) : prior to applying the spray paint , mask off areas where your circuit board traces ( printed wires ) will be .
You can use licorice strings ( see below ) or pretzel sticks to do the masking .
After painting , remove the masks to expose the graham cracker colored lines below .
[ Off - topic practical joke idea : lightly apply this green spray paint to hidden surfaces of ( your housemate / roommate ’s ) bread or cheese .
Instant mold ! ]
Wires and cables
We ’re also going to need a set of wires .
Fortunately , this is an area where modern snack foods excel .
There is quite a selection of wire - shaped extruded food , and we get our pick of it .
First , these are “ Fruit Streamers ” , fruit snacks in the shape of a ribbon cable , with wires that can be pulled apart .
Neat .
While these purport to be polychromatic , the “ blue ” and “ green ” strands can hardly be told apart , and the opacity leaves something to be desired .
None the less , here they are .
Haribo licorice wheels are a good source of red or black “ wire . ”
The rolls are very long , and give you by far the longest wires that we had to work with .
Downside :
They tend to retain a serious curl even after dereeling .
Note : we are n’t sure why the red ones– presumably made in the same factory – are so much smaller .
Maybe that ’s how you ’re supposed to tell the genders apart or something .
Air Heads Xtremes Sweetly Sour Belts .
What … the… heck … is it ?
So far as I know , “ belt ” is not the name of any type of food .
None the less , these exist and were in the candy aisle .
I therefore infer that these are actually meant to be eaten .
While the colors are bright , and the components do separate , this was just awful to work with– the sticky surface texture left you feeling like you ’d just been handling salted , fluorescent bacon .
Yuck .
They did n’t even get the colors of the rainbow in the right order .
If you leave it intact , it might make a good looking ribbon cable , but it ’s probably not worth the hassle .
These Twizzlers “ Twisted berry ” wires , er , candy strands turned out to be the nicest to work with .
Disgusting … yet great .
Very bright , opaque , visible , strong , and can be neatly spliced .
On the down side , it would be nice if they were longer .
They can be easily separated ( right ) into bright red and blue parts ; there are also dull purple wires along for the ride .
Passive Components
Here we have an assortment of roll candies : SweeTarts , Necco wafers , Lifesavers Gummies , Lifesavers 5 - flavor , Lifesavers wint - o - green .
These are ( to various degrees ) good raw materials for making cylindrical components like resistors or capacitors .
On the right is one of our failed experiments .
It ’s a stack of Necco wafers , where the colors are picked to make a resistor : Brown Black Yellow …
Gold , or 100 k , 5 % .
The stack is held together with layers of icing .
While this is an easy approach , it just does n’t look that good .
That ’s because the color saturation of Necco wafers is poor and their inconsistent shape leads to large gaps between
neighboring wafers .
( Perhaps a better use for the Necco wafers would be as ceramic disc capacitors . )
We made most of our resistors by creating stacks of four wint - o- green life savers , held together by icing .
Once the icing has set ( just a few minutes ) , you can use food coloring to paint the rings with the appropriate color code , brown - black - yellow - gold in this case .
The great things about this technique are ( 1 ) it leaves a hole to put your wire through and ( 2 ) the white candy surface takes most colorations very well .
There are certainly a lot of other ways to build resistors , and keep in mind that there is a lot of variation amongst even standard resistors .
On the right is a set of food coloring pens that we used to help color in the lines on the resistor .
These are like the ones that we used to write on hearts , but with a broader tip .
This mixture of licorice candies simply boggles the mind .
Not only are there the usual licorice “ allsorts ” , but gummy bears and even gummy frogs .
It * looks like * it ’s whatever fell off the side of the conveyor belt in the factory that makes the Haribo licorice candies .
The most - unusual ones are interesting ; A variety of odd shapes that look a lot like the odd shapes of capacitors that are available .
With the help of some pretzel sticks , you can take any one of those strange candy - coated licorice bits and turn it into an electrolytic capacitor with radial leads .
We recently found these Haribo “ Brixx . ” – which are thankfully not actually brick flavored .
What ’s interesting is that if you slice these thin , they make a great model of a certain type of capacitor .
Regular old marshmallows .
While these can be used for many different purposes in circuitry snacks , there are a few places where they really excel :
As battery cells , as large electrolytic capacitors , and ( when painted with a suitable set of colored stripes ) resistors .
On the right you can see one dressed up as a ‘ C ’ cell ; an icing bump was added to one end of the marshmallow before painting that end orange .
Two other building blocks that we have found to be generally handy : Miniature marshmallows and Tootsie rolls .
These miniature marshmallows come in a variety of pastel colors , but white will work just as well .
They can be used in a variety of ways : as small electrolytic capacitors , as inductors , as glass - passivated components like diodes , and if painted suitably , as resistors in a circuit .
Tootsie rolls are sculptable raw material , for which the possibilities are endless .
For some earlier designs , we wrapped colored licorice bands around them to make resistors with color codes .
Semiconductor Components
What is a jujube ?
We ’ve always heard it pronounced “ Joo - Joo - Bees , ” but the spelling looks like it should read “ Joo - Joobs . ”
Regardless , these hard little translucent cylinders are a bizarre suspension of sugar , starch and mineral oil– hence the “ fat free ” logo .
They look a little bit like LEDs , or the lenses that go over them .
If you wanted to build the edible equivalent of an LED matrix , these are your best bet .
The translucent quality also lends them to play the role of glass - encapsulated diodes .
On the right are several 1N914 small - signal diodes that we ’ve assembled from pretzel sticks , icing , food coloring , and either a jujube or a miniature marshmallow .
Dots are little gumdrops that look like regular sized ( T - 1 3/4 ) LEDs , if you stand them up on two toothpicks or pretzel sticks .
( The prominent “ LED ” in the picture at the top of the photo is one of these . )
Much like LEDs , regular Dots come in red , orange , yellow and green .
If you want the elusive blue ones , you have to look hard .
In this case , we found them in the box of “ Tropical ” Dots .
There is also a second variety of black - colored Dots , called “ Crows . ”
Crows are essentially identical in shape and size– and look like infrared LEDs or phototransistors .
Any number of chocolate - bar - like foods can be made into edible versions of integrated circuits .
Kit Kat , Twix , and Mini Charleston Chews are small components that make good models of integrated circuits in long , skinny packages .
Chocolate covered graham crackers are another good option .
The aspect ratio is good for doing large - scale models of ( e.g. ) 8 - pin DIP packages ;
These are the ones that we made into 555s .
The “ fudge sticks ” are neatly rectangular layered wafer cookies with a thin chocolate coating .
It ’s kind of like a Kit - Kat bar in the limit where the cookie goes to unit volume where the chocolate coating goes to zero volume .
Because they are so neatly rectangular , they make a good medium - size chip .
Actually , they do n’t taste half bad either .
To make these chocolate - bar like items into chips , use hard icing to add a legend to the top , a marker by pin 1 and the correct number of pins to the edges .
Be sure to do this on waxed paper or parchment paper so that you can unstick the legs after they harden .
The smaller chips here are charleston chew based quad op - amps ( TL074 ) .
The two ATtiny 2313s shown here are based on a “ fudge stick ” and a Kit Kat .
The three 555 chips ( at a different scale ) are made from chocolate - covered graham crackers with icing detail .
Twizzlers nibs : short black pieces of licorice with a D - shaped profile .
Perfect for making those little TO - 92 shaped food projects , e.g. , a 2N3904 transistor .
Here , we ’ve written the designation on the surface– it ’s very tricky to squeeze out icing that fine .
We ’ve also added three toothpick feet .
Toothpicks are not , strictly speaking , food .
However , they are often * allowed * as structural component to assemble food .
An even better trick is to avoid the use of toothpicks at all , by making edible legs for your components .
You can do this by making rigid icing rods .
Lay down even stripes of icing on parchment paper and allow to dry overnight .
Pick them off the parchment and use icing to attach them where they need to go .
In this case , we ’ve made a transistor by sticking several of the solidified icing sticks to the bottom of the licorice piece .
This way it ’s fully edible– much better than using toothpicks !
Putting it all together
Let ’s start putting some boards together .
On the left is a simple board featuring a full - size Kit Kat , made into an AVR ATmega168 .
We have supplied this board with power connections via the ribbon cable .
In the board on the right we have an ATtiny2313 , a TL074 quad op - amp and a 1N914 diode .
For both of these boards , we are modeling the circuit as a printed circuit board where the components are visible but the traces on the printed circuit board are not ; it ’s certainly sufficient detail for most folks to recognize this as a circuit board .
The next step is to make the logical leap to designing a detailed circuit out of edible components :
What ’s better than a 555 LED blinking circuit ?
A 555 LED blinking circuit that you can eat !
To make this , we started with the graham cracker circuit board , two 100k ( brown - black - yellow ) resistors and one 330 ohm ( orange - orange - black ) all made from lifesavers .
The 555 is a chocolate covered graham cracker , the 1 uF ceramic disc capacitor was formerly a Nilla wafer .
The 9V battery was made from a “ fun size ” Three Musketeers bar .
The red LED came out of a box of Dots , and all the wiring is Twizzlers “ berry ” wire , all soldered together with hard icing .
This circuit is the starting point for a lot of good things , for example the Cylon Pumpkin .
The next circuit that we ’re building here is a Joule Thief , a simple boosting power supply that can run a blue LED from a single 1.5 V battery .
That ’s a neat trick , since it usually takes at least 3.5 V to run a blue LED .
This circuitry snack contains a marshmallow battery , a 1 k ( brown - black - red ) resistor , a bifilar wound toroidal coil ( wound around a Sushki — like a hard miniature bagel cookie ) , a 2N3904 transistor , and a blue LED .
So , we ’ve walked through some of the snack food choices that seem promising for circuitry snacks , how to assemble them into simulated electronic components , and how to put them all together on an edible circuit board .
What other cool ideas for candy circuits can you come up with ?
We ’re looking forward to seeing the results !
Daniel Gross is a very good and quite prolific writer on the economy , from his “ Moneybox ” columns in Slate to his “ Economic View ” columns in the New York Times ; soon , he will be taking his skills to Newsweek .
His new book , Pop !
Why Bubbles are Great for the Economy , tells the story of various American investment bubbles , from frenzied railroad overbuilding in the 1880s to the dot - com delirium of the 1990s .
His conclusion : notwithstanding the damage to individual companies , and perhaps millions of stockholders , bubbles play a determinedly healthy role in the continuing success of U.S. industry .
The following excerpt sums up his argument quite well :
[ I ] f you take the long view … it ’s possible to detect a pattern that emerges in bubbles and their aftermaths .
Especially bubbles that leave behind a new commercial and consumer infrastructure .
With apologies to Oliver Stone , these bubbles , for lack of a better word , are good .
These bubbles are right ; these bubbles work .
Thanks to the American penchant for creative destruction and the U.S. bankruptcy system , investors — and the economy at large — tend to get over bubbles quickly .
…
The stuff built during infrastructure bubbles — housing and telegraph wire , fiber - optic cable and railroads — does n’t get plowed under when its owners go bankrupt .
It gets reused — and quickly — by entrepreneurs with new business plans , lower cost bases , and better capital structures .
And when new services and businesses are rolled out over the new infrastructure , entrepreneurs can tap into the legions of users who were coaxed into the market during the bubble .
This dynamic is precisely what has made Google the “ it ” company of this decade …
Looking back , many similarly iconic companies and industries that have stimulated economic growth , and that helped define America ’s commercial culture , were either formed in those hothouse bubble environments or can trace their origins to their aftermaths .
Consumer packaged goods and mass retailing , data services and mass media , the vast financial services sector , tourism , telecom , and what venture capitalists still call “ the Internet space . ”
Sears , the Associated Press , Western Union , Fidelity Investments , Google — they may all have developed anyway .
But they certainly would not have developed as they did without the Pop ! dynamic .
Teaching an Old Dog New Tricks
The Problem is Complexity
My first experience with software quality was in 1976 , when I sat in front of an ASR - 33 and laboriously typed 2 pages of BASIC code from David Ahl 's " Creative Computing " into my high school 's Hewlett - Packard 21 MX .
Supposedly it would let me simulate a lunar landing , but I discovered when I told it to " RUN " that the colons scattered all over the listing were actually important to the correct functioning of the program .
Oops !
I wish I could say that in that moment I achieved some kind of enlightenment about code quality - but instead I think I learned what most programmers learn - fiddle with it until it stops complaining .
Then , not much later , I learned that a program that 's not complaining still may not be working right .
If I recall correctly , my lunar landing simulation went off into an infinite loop , and I 've been hooked on computing ever since .
( This book got me hooked )
A lot has changed since my first year as a programmer , but two things have changed hardly at all :
The more complicated the program is , the harder it is to get it right .
It 's really hard to tell the difference between a program that works and one that just appears to work .
Like a lot of programmers , I jumped into coding without even knowing what a " debugger " was .
When I first encountered a program designed to help you write programs , it was like a big light - bulb going on in my head .
By then , like most programmers , I had considerable practice at debugging using " PRINT " statements - although , by then , I had graduated to " printf ( ) " even the early version of " adb ( 1 ) " was a huge step in the right direction .
Old Tricks : Saber -C
Fast - forward a few years and I encountered my next big paradigm - shifting program to help me write programs : Saber - C. (1 )
At that time I was a presales support consultant for DEC and was constantly writing small bits of code for customers and internal users .
DEC offered Saber - C on ULTRIX , and I decided to play with it because it was described to me as a " kind of super duper debugger . "
It turned out that Saber - C was a C language interpreter , which was fantastic because the run-time environment was fully simulated rather than simply being allowed to run , then monitored as you 'd get in a debugger .
So , if you allocated an int , and tried to use it as a char * , you got an error .
Since it tracked the allocated size of a memory object as well as its type , you 'd get a warning if you accessed off the end of an array , or walked a structure member in a structure you had just freed .
I do n't know how many times I 've seen code where someone is freeing a linked list like this :
struct listelem { int stuff ;
struct listelem * next ; } ; /* simplified to make it obvious what I am doing wrong */ freelist ( struct listelem * lp ) { while ( lp != ( struct listelem *)0 ) { free ( lp ) ; lp = lp -> next ; } }
That piece of code is especially pernicious since it'll work almost all of the time - until you run it on a weird architecture or with a memory allocator that compacts the freed space in a way that changes the contents of lp -> next after the call to free ( ) .
I could show you the countless scars - literally , the death of a thousand cuts - that I 've suffered from this kind of minor sloppiness .
For me , using Saber - C was an eye - opener .
It gave me a whole new approach to development , since I could use the interpreter to directly call functions from a command line , without having to write a test - harness with a main ( ) routine and controlled inputs and outputs .
My test - harnesses were just a file of direct calls to the function I was writing , which I could feed directly into the interpreter with a mouse - click .
Being able to do that , without having to go through a compile / link / debug cycle , my code- creation sped up dramatically and I was catching bugs in " real - time " as I wrote each block of code .
After a little while , I think I can safely say that the quality of my code skyrocketed .
When I left Digital and went to Trusted Information Systems , I got involved in developing an internet firewall for The White House , as a research project under DARPA .
As technical lead of that project , I had a small budget and used it to buy a copy of Saber - C , to serve as my main development environment .
I wrote , debugged , and tuned the TIS Firewall Toolkit ( FWTK ) ( 2 ) entirely under Saber - C .
The resulting code was remarkably robust and stable , though it eventually succumbed to feature - creep and the resulting code - rot as an increasing number of programmers had their hands in the code - base .
What can I say I learned from my Saber - C experience ?
First off , that there is no excuse for writing unreliable software .
Humility - and an acceptance that you can and do make mistakes - is the key to learning how to program defensively .
Programming defensively means bringing your testing process as close as possible to your coding so that you do n't have time to make one mistake and move on to another one .
I also learned that code that I thought was rock - solid was actually chock - full of unnoticed runtime errors that worked right 99 % of the time , or were reliable on one architecture but not another .
I used to use Saber - C as my secret weapon to convince my friends I had sold my soul to The Devil : whenever they were dealing with a weird memory leak or a wild pointer that was making their programs crash with a corrupted stack or mangled free list .
Usually Saber - C could pinpoint the problem in a single pass .
I do n't write as much software as I used to ( not by a long shot ) but I keep an old Sparc Ultra - 5 with Saber - C in my office rack for when I need it .
New Tricks : Fortify
As we 've all discovered in the last decade , it 's not enough for code to simply work correctly , anymore .
Today 's software has to work correctly in the face of a high level of deliberate attack from " security researchers " ( 3 ) or hackers eagerly attempting to count coup by finding a way to penetrate the software .
Reliability tools like Saber - C help produce code that is relatively free of run-time errors , but the run-time testing performed by the typical programmer does not take into account the kind of tricks hackers are likely to attempt against the software once it is in the field .
I know that I , personally , am guilty of this : when I wrote input routines for processing ( for example ) a user login , I worried about what would happen if the line was too long , or if a field was missing , or quotes did n't match - and that was about it .
The recent history of internet security shows that most programmers take the same approach : worry about getting things as right as you can based on the threats you know about , then cross your fingers and ship the software .
Most programmers who are aware that security is a consideration will learn maxims like " do n't use strcat ( ) " and might use snprintf ( ) instead of sprintf ( ) , but the environment is constantly changing , and so are the rules - it is impossible to keep up .
( How not to ship code that blows up elegantly in your customer 's face )
As you can see above , people are working on dealing with detecting some of these flaws at run-time .
Obviously , I 'm a big fan of run - time error detection , but I think it should be done while the code is being developed , not while it 's being run by the user .
This error happened , as I was writing this , when QuickTime Player did n't like something in the music I was listening to .
This lucky accident is a case in point of " better than nothing , but still half - assed . "
Three years ago I joined a technical advisory board ( TAB ) for a company called Fortify , that produces a suite of software security tools .
One of the big advantages of being a TAB member for a company is that you can usually mooch a license for their software if you want a chance to play with it .
As part of another project I 'm involved in , I am leading development of a website that is being coded in JSP - since security is always a concern , I wanted to be able to convince our engineers to use a code security tool .
So I asked Fortify for an evaluation copy of their latest version , planning on running some code through it to see how well it worked .
Fortify 's tools are built around a source code analyzer that renders a variety of programming languages ( Java , C , ... ) into an intermediate form which is then processed with a set of algorithms that attempt to identify and flag dangerous coding constructs , possible input problems , and so forth .
For example , one of the approaches Fortify uses is similar to the " tainting " system that can be found in the Perl programming language : as an input enters the system it is tracked through the code - flow .
Places where that input is used to compose other pieces of data are examined , and a flag is raised if the " tainted " data might find its way into a composed command such as an SQL call or shell escape ( " injection attack " ) .
In C programs , tainted data is tracked by size to verify that it is not copied into a memory area that is too small for it ( " buffer overflow attack " ) .
Later on , I 'll show you what that looks like , when Fortify correctly discovered a potential buffer overflow in some of my code .
This is incredibly useful because of the prevalence of buffer overflows and injection attacks .
But the problem , really , is that there are too many attack paradigms in play today for any programmer to keep track of .
Security specialists , even , have a hard time keeping track of all the ways in which code can be abused - it 's just too much to expect a " typical programmer on a deadline " to be able to effectively manage .
After a bit of thinking , I cooked up the idea of taking Fortify 's toolset and running it against my old Firewall Toolkit ( FWTK ) code from 1994 , to see if my code was as good as I thought it was .
As it happens , that 's a pretty good test , because there are a couple of problems in the first version of the code that I already knew about - it would be interesting to see if Fortify was able to find them .
Building Code With Fortify Source Code Analyzer ( SCA )
The source code analyzer acts as a wrapper around the system 's compiler .
In this case , since I was working with C code , I was using it as a front - end ahead of gcc .
( Running code through sourceanalyzer )
Before I could get my old code to build on the version of Linux I was using , I had to fix a bunch of old - school UNIX function calls that had been obsoleted .
Mostly that meant changing old dbm calls to use gdbm instead , and replacing crypt ( ) with a stub function .
I also removed the X - Windows gateway proxy from the build process because I do n't install X on my systems and did n't have all the necessary header files and libraries .
It turns out that , if you were reasonably careful about how you pass the $ ( CC ) compiler variable into your makefiles , you can run the code through source analyzer without having to alter your build process at all .
This is a crucial point , for me .
I think that one major reason developers initially resist the idea of using a code checker is because they 're horrified by the possibility that it will make their build process more difficult .
That 's a serious consideration , when you consider how the infinite various flavors of UNIX have become subtly incompatible , and how smart / complex it has made the typical build process .
I admit that my original decision to use FWTK had something to do with my comfort in knowing it has a very minimalist build process and relatively few moving parts .
As it turned out , adding sourceanalyzer to the FTWK build ( see above ) required absolutely no changes at all ; I simply passed a new version of CC on the command line , e.g :
make CC= ' sourceanalyzer - b fwtk gcc '
When you run the code through the source analyzer , you provide a build identifier ( in this case - b fwtk ) that Fortify uses later when it 's time to assemble the analyzed source code into a complete model for security checking .
Running the source analyzer ahead of the compilation process slowed things down a bit , but not enough to bother measuring .
My guess is that for a large piece of software it might add a significant delay - but , remember , you 're not going to do a security analysis in every one of your compile / link / debug cycles .
( Performing an analysis run with sourceanalyzer )
Once you 've run the code through sourceanalyzer , it 's time to perform the full analysis .
Invoking sourceanalyzer again with the " - scan " option pulls the collected scan results together and does a vulnerability analysis pass against them .
In the example above , I ran it with flags to create an output file in " FVDL " - Fortify 's Vulnerability Description Language , an XML dialect .
Fortify supports several different data formats for the analysis results ; I used the XML in this example because I wanted to be able to look at it .
Like most XML , it 's extremely verbose ; the preferred analysis format is something called " FPR " - in this example performance was not my objective .
Running the scan process is a lot more intensive than the first pass .
I was not running on beefy hardware ( 1.2 Ghz Celeron with 1 Gb of RAM running Linux ) and the analysis took several minutes to complete .
Earlier , before I switched to the machine with 1 Gb of RAM , I was running on an older server with a 500 Mhz processor with 256Mb of RAM - Fortify warned me that " performance would suffer " and it was n't kidding !
If you 're going to run Fortify as a part of your production process , you should make sure that your analyst 's workstation has plenty of memory .
One thing that impressed me about how Fortify 's system works is that it 's very environment - agnostic .
The fact that I did n't have X - Windows on my Linux box did n't matter ; I was able to generate the analysis using command line incantations that took me all of five minutes to figure out .
I have to confess at this point that I barely read the documentation ; I was able to rely almost completely on a " quick walkthrough " example .
After the FPR / FVDL analysis file was produced , I fired up the Audit Workbench ( Fortify 's graphical user interface ) on my Windows workstation , and accessed the results across my LAN from a samba - shared directory .
I was pleasantly surprised that , not only did it work flawlessly , Audit Workbench asked me if I wanted to specify the root directory for my source tree because the files appeared to be remote - mounted .
I ran all my analysis across the LAN and everything worked smoothly .
( Summary of the FWTK analysis )
When you open the FPR / FVDL with Audit Workbench you are presented with a summary of findings , broken down in terms of severity and by categories of potential problems such as Buffer Overflow , Resource Injection , Log Forging , etc .
You are then invited to suppress categories of problems .
( Turning off different analysis issues )
I thought that being able to suppress categories was very cool .
For example , on the FWTK code I was assuming that the software was running on a secured platform .
One of the options for category suppression is " file system inputs " - which disables the warnings for places where the software 's input comes from a configuration file instead of over a network .
Turning this off greatly reduced the number of " Hot " warnings in the FWTK - it turns out there were a few ( ahem ! ) small problems with quote - termination in my configuration file parsing routines .
If someone was on the firewall and able to modify the configuration file , the entire system 's security is already compromised - so I turned off the file system inputs and environment variable inputs .
( Audit Workbench in action - click for a detail view )
The screenshot above is the main Audit Workbench interface .
Along the upper left side is a severity selector , which allows you to focus only on Hot , Warning , etc. , issues .
Within the upper left pane is a tree diagram of the currently chosen issue and where it occurs in the code , with a call flow below .
I found this view to be extremely useful because it did a great deal to jog my memory of inter-function calling dependencies in code I 'd written over fifteen years ago .
If you look closely at the screen - shot above you 'll see that one of the candidate buffer overflows in the FTP proxy had to do with where the user 's login name is parsed out using a routine called enargv ( ) .
I distinctly recall that routine as being fairly complicated but , more importantly , I know I did n't write it with the idea that it might be subjected to nasty quote - balancing games from an attacker .
When you click on the lines in the small display , it pops you to the source code in question , so you can see exactly what is going on .
In this example , I 'm taking a string ( the user 's login name that they provided to the proxy ) and tokenizing it from their input using enargv( ) , sprintf ( ) ing it into a buffer then handing it to syslog ( ) .
Ouch !
As it turns out with closer inspection , there were some controls on the length that the value of authuser could reach , at that point , but it 's definitely dodgy code that deserved review .
Let 's follow the code - path and you 'll see what I mean .
It 's a good example of how unexpected interactions between your code and your own library routines can get you into trouble .
The problem starts in ftp-gw.c :
ftp -gw.c : usercmd ( ) ( code removed for this example )
char buf [ BSIZ ] ; /* BSIZ is 2048 */ char tokbuf [ BSIZ ] ; char mbuf [ 512 ] ; char * tokav [ 56 ] ; /* getline called to read remote user 's command input */ if ( ( x = getline ( 0 , ( unsigned char *) buf , sizeof ( buf ) - 1 ) ) < 0 )
return ( 1 ) ;
if ( buf [ 0 ] == ' \0 ' )
return ( sayn ( 0 , badcmd , sizeof ( badcmd ) - 1 ) ) ;
tokac = enargv ( buf , tokav , 56 , tokbuf , sizeof ( tokbuf ) ) ; if ( tokac <= 0 ) return ( sayn ( 0 , badcmd , sizeof ( badcmd ) - 1 ) ) ;
So far , so good .
Fortify has identified that some input is coming in on a socket , through its analysis of getline ( ) and is tracking the use of that input as it flows through the code .
It 's also performing analysis to track the sizes of the data objects as they are used .
In this example , that 's my problem .
I wo n't walk you through all the code of enargv ( ) but it's a string tokenizer that " understands " quotes and whitespace and builds an argc / argv - style array of tokens .
It 's pretty good about checking for overflows , but if invoked with the correct input , in this case , enargv( ) could be coerced into returning a string that was one character smaller than BSIZ , or 2048 bytes .
And that 's where the code analyzer flags that this potentially large blob of data is getting used in some risky ways :
ftp-gw : line 679 ( where the audit workbench identified " multiple issues " ) cmd_user ( )
char buf [ 1024 ] ;
char mbuf [ 512 ] ; /* some processing done in which " dest " is plucked out of the tokav / tokac set that was parsed earlier with enargv ( ) ... then : */ { sprintf ( mbuf , " Permission denied for user %.100s to connect to %.512s " , authuser , dest ) ; syslog ( LLEV , " deny host= %.512s/%.20s connect to %.512s user= %.100s " , rladdr , riaddr , dest , authuser ) ; say ( 0 , mbuf ) ; return ( 1 ) ; }
Ouch !!
I am trying to stuff a string that is potentially up to 2048 characters into mbuf which is 512 .
What was my mistake ?
Simple : I relied on a function that I had written years before , and had forgotten that it would potentially return strings that were as large as the original input .
This kind of mistake happens all the time .
I 'm not making excuses for my own bad code - the point is that it 's absolutely vital to go through your code looking for this kind of mistake .
I know that , if you had asked me at the time when I wrote it , I would have sworn that " It was written with insane care ; there are no unchecked inputs ! "
And I 'd have been wrong .
This was a fairly subtle mistake that I overlooked for 3 years while I was actively working on the code , and Fortify found it immediately .
My over - reliance on syslog ( ) also turned out to be a problem a number of years after the FWTK was released .
One version of UNIX ( that shall remain nameless .... ) syslog ( ) function had an undersized fixed - length buffer that it used to construct the log message 's date / time stamp and the message - since the FWTK code tended to push lengthy messages containing ( among other things ) host DNS names , an attacker could craft a buffer overrun and push it through the FWTK 's overeager logging .
This is another place where an automated tool is useful : if the tool 's knowledge - base contained the information that sending syslog ( ) messages longer than 1024 bytes was risky on some operating systems , the code analyzer would have checked all my syslog ( ) function calls for inputs longer than 1024 bytes .
In fact , when the code analyzer 's knowledge - base gets updated with a new rule , it 's going to retroactively trigger you auditing code you knew was OK but that may no longer be OK in the light of your new knowledge .
One feature of Audit Workbench that I did n't use for this experiment was the analyst 's workflow .
At the bottom of the screen is a panel with a " Suppress Issue " button and some text entry fields and drop - menus .
These implement a problem tracking and reviewing system that looks extremely well thought - out .
If I were resuming maintenance of this software and was establishing a code review / audit cycle , I could now review each of the hot points Fortify identified and either fix bugs , redesign routines , or mark the hot point at reviewed and accepted .
For a larger body of code this would allow multiple analysts to coordinate working on a regular review process .
If I were a product manager producing a piece of security - critical software , I would definitely use Fortify to establish a regular audit workflow as part of my release cycle .
The number of issues Fortify identified in the FWTK code is pretty daunting .
After a day spent digging into them , I found that a lot of the items that were flagged were false positives .
Many of those , however , were places where my initial reaction to to the code was " uh - oh ! " until I was able to determine that someplace earlier in the input there was a hard barrier on an input size , or some other control against inappropriate input .
It made me reassess my coding style , too , because I realized that it 's important to keep the controls close to the danger - points , rather than letting them be scattered all over the code .
When I collect network input , I typically scrub it by making sure it's not too long , etc. , then pass it down to other routines which work upon it in a state of blind trust .
In retrospect I realize that doing it that way could lead to a situation in which the lower - level routines get inputs that they trust , which came via a path that I forgot to adequately scrub .
The example of my use of enargv( ) in the FTP proxy is a case of exactly that kind of mistake .
When I first started using Saber -C , I felt like it was a tool that taught me things that made me a better programmer .
I feel the same way about Fortify .
Experience with Other Open Source Packages
Once I had gotten some hands on with Fortify , I decided to assess the level of difficulty in applying it against a few other security critical , popular , Open Source programs .
My main concern was whether the build process would admit substituting sourceanalyzer for gcc without having to spend hours editing makefiles .
The results were good - postfix , courier IMAPd , syslog -ng , BIND , and dhcpd all turned out to work if I specified sourceanalyzer as $ ( CC ) .
I.e. : all I had to do was tell it :
make CC= ' sourceanalyzer - b postfix gcc '
and it ran through from the command line with no changes in the build process at all .
Sendmail proved to be a little bit more difficult but only because I was too stubborn to read the build instructions ( two minutes ) and figured it out by reading through the build scripts and makefiles instead ( two hours ) .
I did not attempt to do an in - depth , or even cursory , analysis of the Open Source packages .
With each one , however , I spent some time reviewing the hot listed items .
Some of the packages had many items flagged ; one of the larger code - bases had several thousand .
Interestingly , I found I could immediately tell which sections were older and better thought - out , and which sections were developed by less experienced programmers .
I imagine you could use the hot list , sorted by code module , to make a pretty good guess as to which of your programmers was more experienced and more careful .
As I was reviewing one hot listed item that looked particularly promising , I discovered a comment above the questionable line of code that appeared to have originated from some kind of manual code audit workflow tool that I have n't identified .
The comment claimed that the operation was safe and that and had been reviewed by so - and - so in version such - and - such .
It 's nice to see that these important pieces of our software " critical infrastructure " are , in fact , being audited for security holes !
One of the packages I examined had a number of very questionable - looking areas in a cryptographic interface that is normally not enabled by default .
My suspicion is that the implementation of that interface was thrown into the software as an option and is n't widely used , so there has been relatively little motivation to clean it up .
The software that you 'd expect would come under concerted attack and review by the hacker and " security researcher " community proved to be fairly clean .
I did n't see anything that immediately jumped out as a clear hole , although I found several dozen places in a module of one program where I felt it was worth sending an Email message to the maintainer suggesting a closer review .
Notification
One topic in security about which I have been exceptionally vocal is the question of how to handle vulnerabilities when they are discovered .
I personally believe that the hordes of " security researchers " ) that are constantly searching for new bugs are largely a wasteful drain on the security community .
The economy of " vulnerability disclosure , " in which credit is claimed in return for discovering and announcing bugs , has had a tremendous negative impact on many vendors ' development cycles and product release cycles .
Many of these larger vendors have begun using automated code - checking tools like Fortify in - house , to improve their software 's resistance to attack .
Indeed , if the " security researchers " actually wanted to be useful , they'd be working as part of the code audit team for Oracle , or Microsoft .
But then they could n't claim their fifteen minutes of fame on CNN or onstage at DEFCON .
My decision to use the FWTK code - base was partly influenced by the fact that it 's very old code and has largely fallen out of use .
I felt that , if I had discovered a lot of vulnerabilities in a widely - used piece of software , I 'd feel morally obligated to invest a lot of my time in making sure they were fixed .
As a matter of philosophy , I do n't approve of releasing information about bugs that will place people at risk - and , in the case of the FWTK I knew I was n't going to annoy the author of the code .
Not too much , anyhow !
I think that this approach worked pretty well , especially considering the number of potential problems I found in my code .
While I was running Fortify against the other open source packages that I mentioned earlier , I indentified six exploitable vulnerabilities in two of the packages .
To say that that was " scary " would be an understatement , since I invested under an hour in poking randomly about in the results from each package .
I followed procedures that have worked for me since the mid-1980's : I researched the owner of the module(s ) in question , contacted them personally , and told them what I 'd found .
Contrary to the ideology of the " full disclosure " crowd , everyone I contacted was extremely responsive and assured me that the bugs would be fixed and in the next release ;
No hooplah , no press briefing , no rushing out a patch .
I wo n't get my fifteen minutes of fame on CNN but that 's all right .
I 'd rather be part of the solution than part of the problem .
Lessons Learned
This experience was very interesting and valuable for me .
First off , it gave me a much - needed booster - shot of humility about my code .
Having a piece of software instantly point out a dozen glaring holes in your code is never fun - but it's an important sensation to savour .
More importantly , it showed me that tools like Fortify really do work , and that they find vulnerabilities faster and better than a human .
That 's a significant result if you 're involved in software development for products that are going to find themselves exposed to the Internet .
Since the FWTK code was developed using extensive run-time checking with Saber - C , it proved to be extremely solid and reliable , but Saber - C never checked specifically for security flaws .
As it turns out , there is a major difference between the kind of analysis your tools should do for run -time reliability as opposed to security .
Clearly , both are necessary .
As a developer ( or " former developer " anyway ) I am deeply concerned about how difficult it is to do a reliable code - build on the various flavors of UNIX / Linux that are popular - adding source code checking to the build cycle was initially scary but it turned out that the fear was n't merited .
I admit I was pleasantly surprised .
The " many eyes " theory of software quality does n't appear to hold true , either .
FTWK was widely used for almost ten years , and only one of the problems I found with Fortify was a problem I already knew about .
So FWTK was a piece of software ( in theory ) examined by " many eyes " that did not see those bugs , either .
When you consider that code - bases like Microsoft's and Oracle 's can number in the tens of millions of lines , it 's simply not realistic to expect manual code - audits to be effective .
Engineers I 've talked to at Microsoft are using some form of automated code checking , but I do n't know what it is .
Oracle is using a suite of tools including Fortify .
I suppose the inevitable end - game with automatic vulnerability checkers is that they will become available to both sides .
That 'll still be a good thing because it will go a long ways toward reducing the current trade in the obvious - bug - of - the - month .
If we can push code quality for Internet applications to the point where a " security researcher " or a hacker has to invest weeks or months to find an exploit , instead of hours , the world will be a much better place .
Acknowledgements
I would like to thank Brian Chess at Fortify for supporting this research through the loan of a sourceanalyzer license .
Jacob West at Fortify was kind enough to answer some of my questions , and to gently RTFM me when I needed it .
(1) Saber - C is now known as " CodeCenter " and is still available for a limited number of platforms .
It never appeared to do very well in the marketplace , which is some kind of tragedy .
It was , and is , a terrific piece of software .
The fact that a product as useful as Saber - C could fail to do well in the market is an indicator of the impoverishment of software " engineering " practices industry - wide .
(2) The Firewall Toolkit later became the core of the TIS Gauntlet firewall .
For a few years after its release , the FWTK code - base was at the center of more than half of the firewalls on the Internet .
(3) I prefer to call them " vulnerability pimps . "
I am a security researcher .
These guys are smart and hard - working but they are not my peers .
Jacqui Smith : Smoked cannabis " more than 25 years ago "
Smith interview
Chancellor Alistair Darling and Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly are among those to admit using the drug when they were younger .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown was among those to say they had never used it .
The Home Office is to review the decision to downgrade cannabis to a class C substance .
Ms Smith , who is to head the review of the UK 's drugs strategy , said she had smoked it " just a few times , " had " not particularly " enjoyed it and had not taken any other illegal drugs .
" I did break the law ... I was wrong ... drugs are wrong , " Ms Smith , 44 , added .
' Sex and drugs '
When asked by the BBC if he had ever smoked cannabis Mr Darling said he had , " occasionally in my youth " .
Chief Secretary to the Treasury Andy Burnham said he had smoked it " once or twice at university " but never since .
Business Secretary John Hutton also admitted smoking cannabis .
Commons leader and Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman has also admitted taking the drug , telling BBC Breakfast : " Yes I did when I was at university 30 years ago , just for a short time . "
I hope that my experiences in my life have actually helped me understand that I do want crime tackled
Jacqui Smith
Home secretary
Profile : Jacqui Smith Smith : I smoked cannabis
Among those who said they had never smoked cannabis were Gordon Brown , Justice Secretary Jack Straw , Defence Secretary Des Browne , International Development Secretary Douglas Alexander , Children , Schools and Families Secretary Ed Balls , Cabinet Office Minister Ed Miliband and Peter Hain , the Work & Pensions Secretary .
Health Secretary Alan Johnson said he " did the sex and rock and roll but not the drugs " .
Hazel Blears , Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government , has said she tried the drug " once or twice when very young , " according to an aide .
Those who declined to comment when contacted by the BBC included Culture Secretary James Purnell and John Denham the Innovation , Universities and Skills Secretary whose spokesman said " we do n't comment on surveys " .
' Personal matter '
Past cannabis use has become less of an issue for politicians in the UK over recent years as a growing number have admitted using , or trying the drug while younger .
In 2000 then shadow home secretary Ann Widdecombe 's call for £ 100 fines for cannabis possession led to eight members of the Conservative shadow cabinet admitting to smoking cannabis in the past .
I 've never taken any hard drugs .
When I was a student , I took one or two puffs of marijuana but that was it .
Vernon Coaker 's confession on becoming drugs minister in 2006
Analysis : Politics and dope
Home Office minister Vernon Coaker last year admitted " when I was a student , I took one or two puffs of marijuana but that was it " .
Other past or present Labour ministers who have admitted cannabis use include Caroline Flint and Patricia Hewitt .
And on Thursday Home Office minister Tony McNulty said he had " encountered " and smoked cannabis once or twice when he was at university .
Mr Brown 's official spokesman said it was a " personal matter for ministers ... there is no Number 10 edict on this one way or another " .
Mental health
On Wednesday , the prime minister told MPs that laws introduced in 2004 , making possession of cannabis a largely non-arrestable offence , could be reversed .
In 2004 the drug was downgraded from Class B , which includes drugs like amphetamines , to Class C alongside substances like anabolic steroids , making it a largely non-arrestable offence .
Will this confession matter ?
Previous polls tell us the answer ...
BBC political editor Nick Robinson
Read Nick 's comments in full
Ms Smith is now to review whether it should be reversed in the light of research into links between cannabis use and mental health problems , and with crime .
A Home Office spokesman said the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) will be asked to review reports that danger from cannabis is increasing due to wider availability of more potent strains such as " skunk " .
The World 's Smallest Countries
This is a comprehensive listing of the world 's seventeen smallest independent countries .
They each contain less than 200 square miles .
If we combined the land area of these 17 countries , we would have a country just a bit larger than Rhode Island .
Even tiny Singapore is too big for this list ( it 's 246 square miles ) .
First , we have some basic geographic information about each microstate ; then you 'll find a list of the 17 , ranked from smallest to largest .

Set Phasers to " Thong " I recently received this intriguing email ...
Steve , I do n't know if you 're a Trekkie , but you seem like just the kind of guy who likes to sit down with a bowl of popcorn and watch old Star Trek episodes .
Maybe I 'm wrong .
In any case , I was watching The Next Generation with my girlfriend tonight , and I came across something interesting .
So interesting in fact , that I thought " If only I had a website where I could share crazy things that I see , I could post this . "
Then I thought about you .
So here 's the story .
During episode 106 ( breaks off into a serious geek - trip ) , Picard makes an inspirational speech to try and bring the Enterprise back from a place where thought is reality , outside anywhere .
The camera goes to several different extras , crewmembers listening to this speech .
When suddenly the camera falls on this man .
Witness him .
See how stupid he looks , he stands there with an air of drunk stupidity , wearing his dress .
My girlfriend and I have a short discussion about it that goes something like this " Uhhh . . "
" Is that guy wearing a dress ? "
" I think he left with his wife 's uniform that morning . "
" Maybe he 's thinking about wearing a dress - they are in a world where thought is reality "
" Yeah ..
He 's thinking really hard about wearing a dress .. "
So , we have a few laughs , and then , a few days later ( today ) , We 're watching episode 115 , and who do we see during the ships evacuation call by Data ?
No other then , MAN IN A DRESS ( Queue loud DAH DAH DAH sound )
It 's clearly him , although he's in the background , and a little blurry , and he clearly ( even at this long distance ) , has a look of stupidity on his face .
We 're going to keep an eye out for him .
I think he 's plotting to take over the Enterprise .
Or at least infest it with a plague of gender confusion .
I 'll keep you updated , whether you like it or not .
- Matt Thanks , Matt .
I 'm not a big Next Generation fan , but I 'm now a huge fan of THIS guy and his smooth space legs .
( I also enjoy that official Star Fleet Brooch he 's got on . )
I was going to say that since you saw him in a subsequent episode , that would disprove the theory that he was only " thinking about wearing a dress . "
But you could argue that after his imagined cross-dressing " test run " in # 106 , he went ahead and made his dreams a reality in # 115 .
Either that , or you just found the ugliest chick on the Enterprise .
If anyone happens to have any further info about him , please shoot me an email .
Thanks to all your emails I know more than I ever cared to know about this dude 's dress .
I 'll put up a bunch of the emails tomorrow .

Charlie Brooker had never been to a festival before .
In fact he'd never even been camping .
So how would he cope with the full Glastonbury experience ?
Here 's an entirely random list of things I hate .
Mud. Rain .
Inconvenience .
Any form of discomfort whatsoever .
Loud noises .
People .
People 's friends .
People standing next to other people , with yet more people in between .
Drunks bumping into you and being sick down your leg .
Poorly maintained public toilets .
Camping .
You 'll find all these things and more at the Glastonbury festival , which is why it has always struck me as heck on earth .
A long weekend in a wet field surrounded by students on cider , thirtysomething Faithless fans , and everyone I avoided at school .
That 's not a holiday .
That 's a penance .
On top of that , I 'd heard my share of off - putting Glastonbury myths .
Tents bobbing in a mud-slide .
Widespread trench foot .
A man on ketamine eating his own hand .
One of my friends swore blind she knew a man who'd been sitting in a Portaloo when some passing japester decided to tip it over , door side down , leaving him trapped inside a coffin full of foaming crap for 15 horrifying minutes ; it went in his eyes and mouth .
He got dysentery .
In summary : pretty far removed from my idea of fun .
Consequently , I 've never been .
Until now .
I got talked into it by the Guardian .
From the start , I was adamant about one thing .
" I 'm not camping , " I said .
" I hate camping more than I hate the Nazis .
Plus I can't use sleeping bags because I get restrictive claustrophobia . "
" What 's that ? " they asked .
" It means I panic in any situation where I can't fan my arms and legs out to their fullest extent . "
" Are you making this up ? "
" Almost , but no .
Anyway , I 'm not camping . "
" But we want you to experience it properly , " they said .
" Sod ' properly ' .
I do n't want to experience it at all .
I can't do it .
I wo n't do it . "
Many complain that Glastonbury has become too corporate and sanitised .
These days you 're more likely to see Alan Yentob slipping in a puddle than a naked hippy up a tree ; celebrities outnumber acid casualties .
There are phone - charging tents and cashpoints .
It 's a theme - park ride .
All of which should make it ideal for cosseted , mid-30s media crybabies like me .
Instead , here I was falling at the first hurdle .
To a wuss like me , a mere tent represented intolerable squalor .
In the end , we struck a deal : the paper would supply me with a magic pop-up tent , so simple a cat could assemble it .
All I had to do was promise to camp for one night , and I could spend the rest of the festival sleeping off - site in a winsome , rustic cottage full of potpourri .
During the day , if I got scared of the crowds , the press pass meant I could hide out in a backstage compound , gawping at Pete Doherty .
The toilets were the clincher : apparently the ones backstage flush properly .
And so I agreed .
But even the prospect of one night of camping terrified me .
A seasoned outdoorsman I ain't .
Within an hour of the phone conversation , I was standing in a branch of " outdoor experts " Black 's - true alien territory - panic - buying like a man who had foreseen Hurricane Katrina .
Cagoules , wellies , rucksacks , pocket torches , a rain hat - even waterproof socks .
Anything capable of repelling the elements .
All that was missing was a sword and a shield .
But who should I go with ?
Everyone I knew either did n't want to go or already had a ticket .
In fact , the only person who'd expressed any interest at all was Aisleyne Horgan - Wallace , the " ghetto princess " from last year 's Big Brother , who has , inexplicably , become a friend of mine in recent months .
So I invited her .
Since Aisleyne knew even less about camping - or Glastonbury - than I did , it gave me the chance to play the expert .
Over the phone , I sagely listed all the equipment she 'd need , down to the waterproof socks , while she took notes .
The day before the festival , she rang to double - check her inventory .
" I 've got a tent from Argos , " she said .
" It was only £ 7.99 . "
Unfortunately for Aisleyne , I did n't know enough about camping to realise that was n't a good idea .
We bagged a lift with some friends of mine , both Glastonbury veterans who would n't raise an eyebrow all weekend .
The arrival was a shock .
Being an almighty and unashamed puss , I 'd never been to a music festival before , let alone the biggest one in Europe .
Having parked somewhere behind the smallest of Saturn 's moons , you have to trudge on foot across what feels like the width of a small county , lugging all your equipment on your back , staring grimly at smartarses who'd had the good sense to cart their stuff on to the site in a wheelbarrow .
Laden with half the contents of the Clapham branch of Black 's , I scarcely fitted through the gate .
Straps dug into every square inch of my flesh .
My shoulders grew extra muscles just so I could pull them .
And the walking never stopped .
This was like being in the army , except at least there you get to let off steam by machine - gunning people in their thousands .
Once you 're in , the sheer scale of it is initially overwhelming .
Imagine forcing the cast of Emmerdale to hurriedly construct Las Vegas at gunpoint in the rain .
Then do it again .
And once more for luck .
That 's Glastonbury : a cross between a medieval refugee camp and a recently detonated circus .
Roads of sloppy mud and drunken civilians shivering in tents ; this is what London would look like if I 'd been in charge for 100 years .
Not because I 'm some kind of laid - back dreamer , but because I could n't organise a piss - up in a pissery .
It 'd take me six decades to assemble the most rudimentary infrastructure .
There 'd be no museums in my London .
Maybe a bin or two , at a push .
Wherever I looked , there were options .
Things to do .
Food stalls , poetry huts , henna - tattoo dungeons ... and music .
It was only Thursday , and the headline acts were n't due till Friday , but already there were sound systems and bands and people banging musical pots together .
Yet in the midst of so much choice , I had focus .
I knew what I wanted to do .
Leave .
Instead , I had to pitch my tent .
The Guardian wanted me to camp out in the main fields , among the public .
I chickened out and opted to set up home in the backstage compound ( which turned out to be a mistake - more on this later ) .
The pop -up a tent was a joy .
It comes flat , disc - shaped .
You throw it in the air and it unfurls into a canvas shell .
Within seconds I was the proud owner of a home fit for a tramp .
Aisleyne 's Argos special took longer to assemble , and turned out to be a striking visual definition of the word " flimsy " .
If Christmas crackers came with folded - up tents inside , they 'd look like this .
It seemed to be made out of soluble material - possibly the same stuff as those translucent breath - mint strips that dissolve on your tongue .
But it was n't raining yet - in fact , the air was downright balmy - and I was optimistic .
Perhaps camping would be fun .
Hell , I might stay here for the whole thing .
I went to the backstage bar , which seemed to be full of people hugging themselves with joy at being " allowed " backstage .
( The sole advantage to a backstage pass , incidentally , is that the area doubles as a short cut between the two main stages .
That 's it .
That 's all you 're " missing " . )
We left the backstage area and headed off into the " proper bit " .
Getting in touch with my festival - hardened friends soon proved impossible - text messages were taking two hours to arrive , making it impossible to sync up a meeting .
Outside the backstage compound , everyone was astonishingly friendly .
And astonishingly everywhere .
It was like the height of rush hour conducted by lazy people in love .
When someone stepped on your foot , they apologised .
There was laughter and music , genuinely funny T - shirt slogans and a palpable sense of relaxed excitement .
We walked up to the Lost Vagueness area and saw people eating in dodgems and children dressed as spacemen .
For an eight - year - old , Glastonbury probably makes more sense than , say , Basingstoke .
After hours of walking and gawping , we headed back to the hospitality section , stopping at a food stall along the way .
( The food at Glastonbury was far , far better than I 'd expected , by the way . )
Then , full and happy , I headed to my tent for an early night .
Which is when things started to go wrong .
If there 's one piece of Glastonbury advice I can give you , it 's this : do n't camp backstage .
On the plus side , there was no flooding , no thieving , and the toilets did indeed flush properly .
On the minus side , at 3 am a group of post - pubescent upper - middle - class music - industry gitsacks pitched their tent beside mine , and no power on Earth could make them stop braying witless bullshit at the top of their idiot lungs .
For hours they tramped round my tent , tripping over the guy ropes and gurgling .
One of them had a bassoon .
All of them were howlingly impressed with themselves .
It suddenly occurred to me that if you fashioned a thick block of concrete the precise shape of the backstage compound , and dropped it from a helicopter , crushing everyone below , you 'd improve the quality of life on the planet by at least 3 % .
The most annoying one was an infuriating raspy - voiced nincompoop who kept waving a blue light - sabre around , subtly flirting with his female companions by pretending it was a glowing penis .
And when he was n't doing that , he was bragging about how much ketamine he'd taken .
" I 'm going to fall over any second , " he rasped .
He was saying this while bouncing up and down next to my head .
He 's going to break my neck , I thought .
I 'm going to have my neck broken by an imbecile with a light - sabre .
All the goodwill for humankind I 'd built up during the day drained away in seconds .
I felt like ripping through the side of my tent and pushing his eyes into the back of his skull with my thumbs - which is n't really in keeping with any festival spirit I know of .
Instead , I sulked off for a charming moonlight piss .
But by now , the bog was overflowing .
Someone - maybe Pete Doherty - was defecating noisily in the cubicle beside me .
I returned to my tent only to discover someone had taken my wellies and inexplicably left them outside .
Then I unzipped the door and found a stranger sleeping on the floor .
And then I realised it was n't my tent .
Of course , even in the dark , mine should have been easy to spot .
It was the one with a bunch of light - sabre - swinging Barnabys beside it .
The next morning I awoke feeling as if I 'd been beaten up .
But I 'd had it easy compared to Aisleyne , whose joke tent had been kicked to death by an early - morning downpour .
She was soaked through , and claimed to have cried herself awake - which is quite a skill .
And then it rained and rained and rained .
The whole site resembled a warzone : I could n't believe the mud , which seasoned visitors were already shrugging off as nothing compared to ' 97 .
All I wanted was a hot bath in the cottage , which by now sounded like the promised land .
I could n't face this merry hell without my creature comforts .
Sod camping .
Sod it to the moon and back .
The thought of being kept awake another night by Captain Lightsabre was too much to bear .
Macho be damned .
I needed cosseting .
I did n't see any bands that afternoon .
I had a bath , stretched out on a comfy sofa , drank tea and watched Operation Petticoat on Channel 4 .
Then I went back to the site , headed up to the Healing Fields , and got an excellent neck massage .
Thus recharged , I returned to the breach and proceeded to drink heavily .
This , I discovered , is key to enjoying the festival .
Your mind needs to be dislodged from its normal position ; your filter adjusted to the point where stomping through endless mud ponds seems gently amusing rather than , say , grindingly depressing .
In fact , the mud eventually becomes nothing more than an ever present slapstick punch line .
The first time you fall over in it , you feel angry and stupid .
Second time you shrug and laugh and scarcely care .
Mind you , I had a flouncey cottage with hot running water .
The people in tents must be idiots .
The rest of Friday night became a bewildering , enjoyable blur - so much so , summing up individual moments feels pointless .
I bumped into a friend with kids and carried her daughter on my shoulders through half the Arctic Monkeys set , like I was Phil bloody Hogan or something , before heading for the Jazz stage to catch the end of Damian Marley ( who was fantastic ) .
Then there was more drink and more things to see .
At some point , I realised something was wrong with my face .
It was smiling .
Saturday was equally strange and fun .
I ended up backstage at the Roots tent watching Damian , Stephen and Ziggy Marley , after one of the 3 am girls blagged us in .
Hanging around with Aisleyne has unforeseen advantages .
Aisleyne , incidentally , had recovered from her tent trauma and was now in her element .
Although she failed to teach me to skank .
At Glastonbury , I 've learned , for every high , a low will inevitably follow , generally a low involving a large amount of rain or mud or both .
If you 're lucky the highs cancel out or even outweigh the lows .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - The United States cannot inflict a military defeat on Iran and any attack would be a huge political mistake , Russia ’s top general said on Tuesday .

“ It is possible to damage Iran ’s military and industrial potential , but it is impossible to win , ” Russian news agencies quoted General Yuri Baluyevsky , head of the Russian general staff , as saying .
“ The United States has a contingent in the region capable of launching a strike on Iranian territory .
“ However , such possible strikes would be a huge political mistake .
Shockwaves from this attack could be felt around the world . ”
Washington and its Western allies accuse Iran of wanting to build nuclear bombs , a charge Tehran denies .
Tensions have been further aggravated by Iran ’s capture of 15 British sailors and marines in the northern Gulf on March 23 .
Russia sells weapons to the Iranian military and is helping Tehran build a nuclear power station on the Gulf although work there is on hold over a payment dispute .
Russian media late last month quoted unnamed sources in Russian military intelligence as saying the United States could launch a strike on Iran as early as April 6 .
RIA news agency quoted a Russian security source as saying Moscow has military intelligence reports that the U.S. has already approved a list of Iranian targets for bomb and missile strikes .
The source said a land operation could follow .
U.S. President George W. Bush has said he will pursue diplomatic means to persuade Iran to drop its uranium enrichment plan but he has refused to rule out the use of force .
Baluyevsky said military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan showed the United States would face a fiasco if it took on Iran as well .
“ The Americans must think twice ( about attacking Iran ) , ” he said .
“ They have already got stuck in Afghanistan and Iraq . ”

It looks more like a vehicle from one of Mel Gibson 's Mad Max movies .
But this four - ton monster truck is the British Army 's new weapon designed to take on insurgents on the front lines of Iraq and Afghanistan .
British - made , the Supacat Weapons Mounted Installation Kit boasts awesome firepower which will be unleashed early next year .
British and other Nato troops are being targeted by roadside bombs and daily firefights .

Infantry soldiers have complained existing Land Rovers provide insufficient protection from the bombers .
Now , the Ministry of Defence is buying 130 of the light - armoured beasts – which can reach a maximum 80 mph – and will take delivery of the first early next year .
They will use a grenade machine gun which fires at up to 340 rounds per minute , usually in bursts of three to five rounds , at targets up to a mile away .
The Supacats will also employ a 7.62 mm - calibre General Purpose Machine Gun , which fires 750 rounds per minute with a range of nearly a mile .

The vehicles , made at Honiton in Devon , will also have a mounted 0.5 in - calibre heavy machine gun , which fires huge rounds more than a mile at a rate of 485 to 635 a minute .
They are powered by a 5.9 - litre turbo - diesel engine and will carry three or four crew .
One senior Army officer described the new super - truck as a " serious bit of kit " , adding it would be a " huge boost to our long - range patrolling capability " .
Senior defence sources say the Supacats will particularly come into their own against the Taliban in Afghanistan 's Helmand Province , which has no roads .
Defence Minister Lord Drayson said last night : " These vehicles are well armed , swift and agile and will boost our capability with some serious firepower .
" The MoD and the Treasury have worked hard to get them to our troops in quick time , and they start going out to theatre early next year . "
Background and Identification
Released on June 29 , 2007 the first iPhone blew up the idea of the cell phone , putting a personal computer / phone / assistant at your fingertips at all times , and pioneering the push to the modern era of the smartphone .
Since its initial release in 2007 , there have been many iterations of the iPhone , released ( mostly ) on an annual cycle .
Each rendition has added new features , faster processing , and improved graphics .
Each iPhone model has a different level of repairability : the 3GS 's front glass is replaceable separate from the display assembly ( glass panels in later models are not ) , while the iPhone 4 provided easier repair of the rear panel and battery .
Newer iPhones like the iPhone 11 have rear glass panels that are notoriously difficult to repair , but their screens are among the simplest to replace in the industry .
With each new design iteration , new iPhone repair challenges arise and old ones are remedied .
Though Apple may tell you otherwise , all of these devices are user - serviceable with the help of our repair guides , found in each of the device pages above .

The Dewey Decimal System , invented in 1876 by Melvil Dewey , sought to categorize books by organizing all knowledge into 10 broad classes , with each class further broken down into 10 divisions and each division into 10 sections .
For finding a specific title there is nothing like it , its supporters say , particularly since it is used all over the world .
Though many college libraries use the Library of Congress system , for more than a century Dewey has been a mainstay in American public libraries , about 95 percent of which continue to rely on it .
The system does have its flaws , though , being limited in what it can do with subjects like cooking and travel , for instance , both of which happen to be popular at bookstores .
Further , noted Barbara Kwasnik , a professor at the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University , Dewey had a strong classification bias when it was created .
There was an emphasis on topics like Christianity and American history , for example , and not enough on Eastern religions and on history outside of the American experience .
But Joan S. Mitchell , editor in chief of the Dewey Decimal Classification , the cooperative that administers the system , pointed out that Dewey had been revised 22 times to address such biases , most recently in 2004 .
Ms. Mitchell also said she could not recall an earlier instance of an American public library ’s totally abandoning Dewey or the Library of Congress system since she became editor of Dewey in 1993 .
Of Mr. Courtright , she said gently : “ Perhaps he knows his library ’s clientele and he ’s meeting their needs .
Libraries are always experimenting to meet the needs of its patrons . ”
Her assessment , though , understates his goals .
Throughout the recent annual convention of the American Library Association , in Washington , Mr. Courtright and 16 of his employees paraded around wearing and distributing eye - catching badges that bore the word “ Dewey ” encircled in red with a slash across the middle .
Though Mr. Courtright ’s assault on Dewey was not an official topic at the convention this year — the association requires at least a year ’s notice for such a designation — his intent is to have it discussed formally next year .
Does he think his approach could signal the death of Dewey in libraries across the nation ?
“ I think it could be , ” Mr. Courtright said .
“ And it probably should be . ”
DEAR ABBY : Your advice to the grieving widower " In Need of Someone " ( June 22 ) was spot on .
I met my husband when I was 14 .
We married at 18 , and he died when he was 44 .
After his death , I had no id ... continue
Because our car is really old , we seldom use it when we travel for fear of the car breaking down in the middle of nowhere , thus , ruining our vacation .
Our best option is to rent a car and to avail additional savings , we select rental companies that accept our AAA card .
When renting cars , one of the things that the sales associate would push is their comprehensive insurance that would probably cost at least $ 15 per day .
It covers only the losses and damages to the vehicle that you ’re renting and medical expenses for you and your passengers .
The biggest pitch is that when something happens to car , you can just “ walk away ” and the coverage is much better than the alternative .
But are they really pushing because of that ?
Or are they pushing it because it is one of the top money maker for the company ?
From what I ’ve heard , the sales associate and managers get a bonus for selling these types of insurance .
What Are Your Alternatives ?
Own comprehensive Insurance .
If you have comprehensive coverage on your auto insurance policy , chances are that your rental car will be covered as well .
However , you will also be subject to the same deductible you carry on the rental car .
This is one of the pitches that the salesperson would tell you :
With their insurance coverage , you do n’t have to pay any deductibles , they will cover for almost 100 % of the damage .
But if you already have insurance coverage , there is no need to over insure yourself as you are just wasting money !
Credit Card Coverage .
Visa and MasterCard credit cards , specifically the gold and platinum cards , offer this coverage at no additional charge as long as you use those cards to reserve and pay for the car rentals .
The advantage of using this method is that you do n’t have to pay the deductibles .
This is also a good option for someone who does not have any comprehensive coverage on their personal auto insurance ( like us , we only have liability insurance coverage since we have an old car and do not need the comprehensive coverage !!)
American Express credit card also has a comprehensive coverage but you have to enroll your Amex credit card .
There are no monthly fees for the enrollment but there is a fee for the insurance coverage which ranges from $ 15 - 25 per car rental .
The good thing about this is that they offer more coverage than the gold and platinum cards and the charges .
This is better than the rental companies insurance cost since the charges are per car rental and not per day !!
The rental day ’s coverage could vary from 30 to 42 days depending on the restrictions .
Lastly , if you do n’t have any comprehensive insurance coverage or credit cards that offer the coverage , then I strongly recommend that you get the car rental companies ’ coverage as you do n’t want to deal with the financial loss that you may incur in case a damage or theft occurs .
The Danger of Patenting Ideas
Richard Stallman raises the bar in this discussion of patent , copyright and trademark law at a Chaos computer seminar in Germany :
In order to think clearly about patent issues , the first thing you have to do is disentangle patent law from copyright law and from trademark law ; various different laws that say totally different things and have essentially nothing in common .
But many people have been misled into thinking that these ideas are really similar .
They are typically misled by the use of the term ‘ intellectual property ’ .
People are told that patents are a kind of ‘ intellectual property ’ and copyright is a kind of ‘ intellectual property ’ , and people who hear this end up thinking that there is some substantial thing called intellectual property , some principle , and that copyrights and patents are just variations in little details .
Nothing could be further from the truth .

English with German introduction ( Englisch mit Einleitung auf Deutsch )
About 20 years ago , the Australian government commissioned a study of the patent system , which concluded there was no evidence at all that Australia benefited by having a patent system … and they said if it were not for international pressure they would recommend abolishing the patent system .

LAGOS ( Reuters ) - A Nigerian lesbian has gone into hiding to avoid arrest days after marrying four women in the Islamic city of Kano , local media reported on Thursday .
An estimated 2,000 guests watched Aunty Maiduguri , 45 , wed the four women in a sumptuous ceremony that was followed by two days of feasting and merry - making .
But neighbours tipped off the authorities , who enforce Sharia law .
“ As defenders of Sharia law , we shall not allow this unhealthy development to take place , ” Rabo Abdulkarim , deputy commander of the state Islamic police , told This Day newspaper .
“ We are investigating the matter with a view to find the culprits and punish them . ”
Kano is one of 12 states in northern Nigeria that introduced Sharia in 2000 .
Homosexuality is also illegal under secular law in Nigeria .
The government introduced a bill last year explicitly to outlaw gay marriage in response to its legalisation in some Western countries .
Africa ’s most populous country is split about evenly between Muslims and Christians , and both communities strongly condemn homosexuality .
SPREADABLE BACON
It all started with a customer request to make “ spreadable bacon , namely mayonnaise . ”
At first , we were skeptical .
Mostly because neither one of us really liked mayonnaise .
NEW YORK --
The plot as painted by law enforcement officials was cataclysmic :
A home - grown Islamic terrorist had in mind detonating fuel storage tanks and pipelines and setting fire to John F. Kennedy International Airport , not to mention a substantial swath of Queens .
" Had the plot been carried out , it could have resulted in unfathomable damage , deaths , and destruction , " Roslynn R. Mauskopf , the US attorney in Brooklyn , said in a press release that announced charges against four men .
She added at a news conference , " The devastation that would be caused had this plot succeeded are just unthinkable . "
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly then stepped to the lectern with a vision only a bit less grim .
" Once again , would - be terrorists have put New York City in their crosshairs , " he said .
Kelly said a disaster had been averted .
But a reading of the criminal complaint filed by the federal authorities against the four defendants in the case -- one of them remained at large yesterday -- suggests a less than mature terror plan , a proposed effort longer on evil intent than on operational capability .
Mauskopf noted in her release that the " public was never at risk " and told reporters that law enforcement " had stopped this plot long before it ever had a chance to be carried out . "
At its heart was a 63 - year - old retired airport cargo worker , Russell Defreitas , who the complaint says talked of his dreams of inflicting massive harm , but who appeared to possess little money , uncertain training , and no known background in conceptualizing or planning a terror attack .
" Capability low , intent very high , " a law enforcement official said of the suspects .
Some law enforcement officials and engineers also dismissed the notion that the alleged plot could have resulted in a catastrophic chain reaction ; system safeguards , they said , would have stopped explosions from spreading .
The complaint , filed in US District Court in Brooklyn , also suggests that at least two of the suspects had some ambivalence .
They had ties with Jamaat al Muslimeen , a dangerous Islamic group that once engineered a deadly coup attempt in Trinidad and Tobago .
The group allegedly had been approached about underwriting a plot .
One of the men was prepared to bomb the airport but leery about killing masses of people , the complaint says .
Another dropped out of the alleged plot for a time to tend to his business .
In the end , the men decided to stop courting the Islamic group and resolved to shop elsewhere overseas for terror financing .
One defendant , Abdul Kadir , who was arrested in Trinidad , is said to have warned the others that the Islamists in Trinidad " wanted to minimize the killing of innocents such as women and children . "
A third suspect , Kareem Ibrahim , 61 , was also arrested in Trinidad , and a fourth , Abdel Nur , 57 , remained at large .
No one would second - guess the authorities for pursuing and arresting suspected plotters .
One of the most enduring lessons that the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , have taught prosecutors and FBI agents is the danger of inaction .
But as with many post - Sept. 11 terror plots , the line between terrible aspiration and reality can get lost in a murky haze .
In case after case , from what authorities said was a dirty bomber to the Lackawanna Six , federal prosecutors hail arrests of terrorists and disruptions of what they describe as sinister plots .
But as these legal cases unfold , the public often is left groping for certainty about the true nature of threats described so graphically by the authorities .
Mauskopf and Kelly declined yesterday to discuss their characterizations of the airport case .
Mark J. Mershon , assistant director in charge of the FBI 's New York office , also spoke at the press conference , and he said yesterday that his message was very clear :
" I believe I spoke the simple truth at the press conference : the ambitions were horrific , the capacities were very limited , but they kept trying .
Their signature was their persistence . "
Neal R. Sonnett , a defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor who was chief of the criminal division in the US attorney 's office in Miami , congratulated the FBI for fine police work in what was clearly " a prosecutable case . "
But he said : " There unfortunately has been a tendency to shout too loudly about such cases . "
" It has a bit of the gang that could n't shoot straight to it , " he said .
" It would have served the federal government well to say that . "
A reading of the criminal complaint suggests why prosecutors and FBI agents grew so alarmed as they learned of the suspects ' alleged ambitions .
In taped statements attributed to Defreitas , he was unequivocal about his desire to kill many thousands of his fellow Americans .
But the same papers give reason for doubt about the competence of the suspects .
The details tend to suggest a distance between Defreitas 's dream and any nightmarish reality .

June 2 , 2007  --
His name has shot up on the list of most Googled terms ; it peppers the blogosphere ; and it is attached to more than 100 networking groups on MeetUp.com .
He is Ron Paul and he is arguably the most popular Republican candidate ... on the Internet .
Dr. Ron Paul , an obstetrician from Texas , is a little - known Republican congressman running on a platform of limited government .
In most national polls , he gets one percent or less of the vote .
But in Internet polls , Paul is frequently in first place .
" We think the Internet is the great equalizer , " said Jesse Benton , communications director of Ron Paul 2008 .
" It is one of the last great , real vehicles of liberty . "
Paul 's star has been on the rise since the Republican debate on May 15 , when he challenged Rudy Giuliani over 9/11 .
" Have you ever read about the reasons they attacked us ? "
Paul asked .
" They attack us because we 've been over there .
We 've been bombing Iraq for 10 years . "
Recently , Paul got huge applause when he appeared on HBO 's " Real Time with Bill Maher , " something rare for a Republican .
Next week , the candidate will be a guest on " The Daily Show . "
Cynics suggest some of Paul 's popularity is manufactured .
Online polls and other Websites have accused Paul 's supporters of spamming to make him appear more popular .
The campaign , however , insists the support is real .
The day after the first Republican debate on May 3 , the campaign Website had 706,000 visitors and , according to Benton , Paul has the most successful YouTube channel of any candidate .
He is also the most requested Republican on Eventful.com , a site where users request candidates visit their city .
Even more striking , Benton says since that May 3 debate , the number of donors to the campaign has increased fourfold .
" I would n't call it a grassroots effort , I 'd call it a grassfire effort .
It 's growing by leaps and bounds , " said Benton .
" We could n't even manage it if we tried . "
Web sites popping up in support of Paul encourage users to network through sites like MySpace , to vote in online polls , to donate money and to join local Paul 2008 groups .
Daniel Walton of Virginia founded his own site , Americans for Ron Paul .
He said he has n't had any contact with the campaign , only with the grassroots Yahoo ! group .
" Some of the people have a disillusionment to the traditional media because they do n't think it 's giving enough press to Ron Paul , which is one reason these blogs and groups have sprung out , " Walton said .
The disillusionment of Paul supporters also extends to the Republican Party .
Paul , 71 , ran for president once before .
In 1988 , he was the Libertarian Party 's nominee for the White House .
He is running as a Republican this time around , but not everyone in the party is welcoming him .
The chairman of the Michigan Republican Party has pushed unsuccessfully to ban Paul from future GOP debates .
Paul is opposed to the war in Iraq and generally to U.S. intervention abroad , and he says he " never votes for legislation unless the proposed measure is expressly authorized by the Constitution . "
Matt McMillan , president of the Internet strategy firm Buzzmaker , said the grassroots effort is gaining ground because of Paul 's outsider status .
" I think one of the reasons may be because he is speaking to policy positions that very few other candidates are staking out -- his libertarian stance on social issues and his conservative stance on taxation , " McMillan said .
" He 's attracting that libertarian base that felt alienated by the Republican candidates and President Bush over the last seven years . "
The campaign also credits the online popularity to Paul 's opposition to taxing and regulating the Internet .
" People who use the Internet are fans of Ron , " Benton said .
Despite the growing fan base , Paul 's candidacy is still a long shot .
McMillan wondered what will happen to his fervent supporters if he is not the nominee .
" What is going to happen with these disgruntled groups ? " he asked .
The answer will come early next year .
In the mean time , the fans will be waiting on the Web .
Speaking UNIX , Part 10
Customize your shell
Persist your preferences to recreate your shell environment

If you work with a tool long enough , you master its purpose .
Moreover , the tool becomes an extension of yourself .
Think of Gustav Klimt 's brush , Louis Armstrong 's trumpet , and Mark Twain 's turn of phrase .
If you 're a virtuoso , your " tools of the trade " effortlessly channel your intent , spirit , and expression to your medium .
By now , I hope your skills have reached those of a UNIX® acolyte .
You practice your command - line katas .
You consult the omniscient oracle of man when you crave knowledge .
And you craft command combinations that perform sheer alchemy on data .
You 're at ease at the command line , and the shell feels comfortable and familiar .
The next stage in your apprenticeship , Grasshopper , is to make the shell your own .
The great and mighty shell
You 've already seen many techniques to customize your shell environment :
You can choose the UNIX shell you 'd like to use .
The Bourne shell is a stalwart ; others , such as the Z shell , offer novelties and conveniences that you may find helpful .
To find the shells available on your UNIX system , use the command cat /etc / shells .
To change your shell to any of the shells listed , use the chsh command .
Here 's an example to change to / bin / zsh , the Z shell .
( Type the text shown in bold . ) $ cat /etc/ shells / bin/ bash / bin/csh /bin/ksh /bin/sh /bin/tcsh /bin/zsh $ chsh -s / bin/zsh
You can create short aliases to stand in for lengthy commands .
Environment variables , such as PATH ( which controls where to search for programs ) and TZ ( which specifies your time zone ) , persist your preferences and affect all the processes you launch .
PATH is especially useful .
For example , if you want or need to run a local , enhanced version of Perl , you can alter your PATH to prefer / usr / local / bin / perl instead of the ( typical ) standard version found in /usr / bin / perl .
UNIX applications often use environment variables for customization , too .
For instance , if your terminal ( or emulator ) is capable , you can colorize the output of ls ( list directory contents ) with the environment variables CLICOLOR and LSCOLORS .
You can retain and recall command lines through the shell 's built - in command history .
Command histories conserve typing , allowing you to re-run an earlier command .
Many shells also allow on - the - fly modification of a previous command to create a new command .
For example , the Bash shell uses the caret ( ^ ) character to perform substitutions : $ ls -l heroes.
txt -rw-r--r-- 1 strike strike 174 Mar 1 11:25 heroes.txt $ ^heroes ^villains ls -l villians.
txt villians.txt
Here , the quirky command line ^heroes ^villains substitutes the word villains for heroes in the immediately previous command ( the default , if a numbered command in the history list is n't provided ) and runs the result , ls -l villians .
txt .
Consult your shell 's documentation for its syntax for command - line substitutions .
) character to perform substitutions :
You can write shell scripts to ( re -) perform complex operations if the existing UNIX utilities and your shell 's built - in features lack a feature you 'd like to use regularly .
As you 'll see in an upcoming " Speaking UNIX " article , you can also download and build an enormous number of additional UNIX utilities , typically provided as open source .
In fact , with Google or Yahoo !
and a few minutes of time , you can usually and readily find and download a suitable solution rather than create your own .
( Be lazy !
Spend your bonus free time watching clouds . )
Of course , with so many options for fine - tuning your shell , it would be nice if you could persist your preferences and re-use those settings time and again , from shell to shell ( say , in different X terminal windows ) , session to session ( when you log out and return to log in again ) , and even across multiple machines ( assuming that you use the same shell on multiple platforms ) .
Shell startup scripts provide this endurance .
When a shell starts and as it terminates , the shell executes a series of scripts to initialize and reset your environment , respectively .
Some startup scripts are system - wide ( your systems administrator configures them ) , and others are yours to customize freely .
Startup scripts are n't like Microsoft® Windows ® INI files .
As the name implies , startup scripts are true shell scripts — those little programs you write to achieve some work .
In this case , the shell scripts run whenever the shell starts or terminates and affect the shell environment .
Start me up !
Typically , each shell provides for several shell startup scripts , and each shell dictates the order in which the scripts run .
At a minimum , you can expect a system - wide startup file and a personal ( per-user ) startup file .
Think of the entire shell startup sequence as a kind of cascade :
The effects of running ( potentially ) multiple scripts are cumulative , and you can negate or alter parameters set early in the sequence in a subsequent script .
For example , your systems administrator might set a helpful default shell prompt for the entire system — something that includes your user name , current working directory , and command history number , for instance — in the system - wide shell startup file .
However , you can override this file by resetting the shell prompt to your liking in your own startup script .
Otherwise , if you do n't alter a system - wide setting , it persists in your shell and environment .
Typically , the earliest startup scripts are system - wide , such as /etc / profile , and your systems administrator manages them .
System - wide startup files are n't intended as an intrusion , but rather facilitate the use of resources specific to that system .
For example , if your system administrator prefers that you use a newer version of the Secure Shell ( SSH ) utility because it addresses a known security flaw , he or she might set each user 's initial PATH variable to / usr / local / bin : / bin : / usr / bin , which prioritizes executables found in /usr / local / bin .
( If the command is n't found in /usr / local / bin , the shell continues its scan in /usr / bin . )
System - wide startup files are also used to name printers , display bulletins about planned downtime , and provide new users with reasonable shell defaults .
( Do n't haze the newbies . )
After the system - wide script ( or scripts ) runs , the shell runs user - specific startup scripts .
The per-user files are the appropriate places to keep your favorite aliases , environment settings , and other preferences .
Planning for the big Bash
The number and names of the shell startup scripts vary from one shell to another .
Let 's look at the startup sequence of the Bash shell , / bin / bash .
The Bash shell is found on all flavors of UNIX and Linux® , and it is typically the default shell of new systems and users .
It 's also representative of many other shells and thus serves as a good demonstration .
( If you use another shell , consult its documentation or man page for the names and processing order of its startup scripts . )
Bash searches for six startup scripts , but each of those scripts is optional .
Even if all six scripts exist and are readable , Bash executes only a subset of the six in any situation .
Bash first executes / etc / profile , the system - wide startup file , if that file exists and the user can read it .
After reading that file , Bash looks for ~/.bash_profile , ~/.bash_login , ~/.profile , and ~/.bashrc — in that order — where ~ is the shell 's abbreviation for the user 's home directory ( also available as $ HOME ) .
If you exit Bash , the shell searches for ~/.bash_logout .
Which of the six files executes depends on the " mode " of the new shell .
A shell can be a login shell , and it might or might not be interactive .
( A login shell is also an interactive shell ; however , you can force a non-interactive shell to behave like a login shell .
More on that later . )
In UNIX days of yore ( a scant two decades ago ) , you typically accessed a UNIX machine through a dumb terminal .
You would type your user ID and password at the login prompt , and the system would spawn a new login shell for your session .
In this environment , a login shell was differentiated from other shell instances ( such as those running a shell script ) by name :
The process name of each login shell was prefixed with a hyphen , as in - bash .
This special name — a longtime UNIX artifact — tells the shell to run any special configuration for login .
An interactive shell is easier to explain : A shell is interactive if it responds to your input ( standard input ) and displays output ( to standard out ) .
Today , the X terminal has replaced the dumb terminal , but the convention and paradigm of shell modes remain .
Usually , X terminal spawns Bash as - bash , which forces Bash to perform the login startup sequence .
In the case of Bash , an interactive login shell runs / etc / profile , if it exists .
( A non-interactive shell also runs /etc / profile if Bash is invoked as bash -- login . )
Next , the interactive login shell looks for ~/. bash_profile and executes this script if it exists and is readable .
Otherwise , the shell continues , trying to execute ~/.bash_login .
If the latter file does n't exist or is unreadable , Bash finally attempts to execute ~/. profile .
Bash runs only one personal startup file — the startup sequence stops immediately afterward .
When a Bash login shell exits , it executes ~/.bash_logout .
If the Bash shell is interactive but not a login shell , Bash attempts to read ~/.bashrc .
No other files are executed .
If the Bash shell is non-interactive , it expands the value of the BASH_ENV environment variable and executes the file named .
Of course , you can provide additional settings by calling your own scripts from within Bash 's standard scripts .
The special shell abbreviation .
( or its synonym source ) executes another shell script .
For example , if you want to share the settings in ~/. bashrc between interactive login shells and interactive non-login shells , place the command :
. ~/.bashrc
in ~/.bash_profile .
When the shell encounters the dot command , it immediately executes the named shell script .
Peering into the shell
The best way to explore the startup sequence is to create some simple shell startup files .
For example , if you run the ssh farfaraway ls command , is the remote shell that SSH spawns on the remote system named farfaraway a login shell ?
An interactive shell ?
Let 's find out .
Listings 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 show sample /etc/ profile , ~/.bash_profile , ~/.bashrc , and ~/.bash_logout files , respectively .
( If these files already exist , make backups before you continue with this exercise .
You need superuser privileges on your machine to change / etc / profile . )
Use your favorite text editor to create the files as shown .
Listing 1 shows a sample /etc / profile script .
This file is the first startup file to run ( if it exists and is readable ) .
Listing 1 . Sample /etc / profile file
echo " Executing / etc / profile . "
PATH= " /bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin " export PATH
Listing 1 echoes a message as the script begins and sets a minimal PATH variable .
Again , this file runs if the shell is an interactive login shell .
For example , launch a new X terminal .
You should see something like this :
Last login : Tue Apr 17 21:06:23 on ttyp1 Executing / etc / profile ( Interactive , login shell ) Executing / Users / strike /.bash_profile ( Interactive , login shell ) Including / Users / strike / .aliases strike @ blackcat 1 $
Good !
That 's the predicted sequence when launching a new login shell in an X terminal .
Notice the shell prompt :
It reflects the user name , the short hostname ( everything before the first dot ) , and the command number .
If you type logout or exit at the prompt , you should see this :
strike @ blackcat 31 $ logout Executing / Users / strike /.bash_logout ( Interactive , login shell )
As described , the interactive login shell runs ~/.bash_logout .
Listing 2 shows a sample ~/.bash_profile file .
This file is one option for customizing your shell at startup .
Listing 2 : Sample ~/.bash_profile file
echo " Executing $ HOME /.bash_profile " echo '( Interactive , login shell ) '
PS1 = '\u @ \h \# \$ ' export PS1 PAGER= / usr / bin/less export PAGER .
. aliases
Next , let 's see what happens when you launch a new shell from the prompt .
The new shell is interactive , but it 's not a login shell .
According to the rules , ~/. bashrc is the only file expected to run .
strike @ blackcat 1 $ bash Executing / Users / strike /. bashrc ( Interactive shell ) blackcat : ~ strike $
And , in fact , ~/. bashrc is the only file to execute .
The proof is in the prompt — the prompt at bottom is the default Bash prompt , not the one defined in ~/.bash_profile .
To test the logout script , type exit ( you can not type logout in a non-login shell ) .
You should see :
blackcat : ~ strike$ exit exit Executing $ HOME /. bash_logout ( Interactive , login shell ) strike @ blackcat 2 $
As an interactive login shell terminates , it executes ~/.bash_logout .
You might use this feature to remove temporary files , copy files as a simple method of backup , or perhaps even launch rsync to distribute any changes made in this most current session .
Listing 3 shows a sample ~/. bashrc file .
This file is the initialization file for non-interactive Bash shell instances .
Listing 3 : Sample ~/.bashrc file
echo " Executing $ HOME /.bashrc " echo " ( Interactive shell ) " PATH=" /usr/local/bin:$ PATH " export PATH
Here 's another experiment :
What kind of shell do you get when you run SSH ?
Let 's try two variations .
( You can simply use SSH to get back to your local machine — it works the same as if you were running SSH from a remote machine . )
First , use SSH to log in to the remote machine :
strike @ blackcat 1 $ ssh blackcat Last login : Tue Apr 17 21:17:35 2007 Executing /etc / profile ( Interactive , login shell ) Executing / Users / strike /.bash_profile ( Interactive , login shell ) Including / Users / strike / .aliases strike @ blackcat 1 $
As you might expect , running SSH to access a remote machine launches a new login shell .
Next , what happens when you run a command on the remote machine ?
Here 's the answer :
strike @ blackcat 3 $ ssh blackcat ls Executing / Users / strike /. bashrc ( Interactive shell ) villians.
txt heroes.txt
Running a command remotely using SSH spawns a non-login interactive shell .
Why is it interactive ?
Because the standard input and the standard output of the remote command are tied to your keyboard and display , albeit through the magic of SSH .
Listing 4 shows ~/.bash_logout .
This file runs as the shell terminates .
Listing 4 : Sample ~/.bash_logout file
echo " Executing $ HOME /.bash_logout " echo " ( Interactive , login shell ) "
Helpful tips for startup files
The more you use the shell , the more you can benefit from persisting your preferences in startup files .
Here are some helpful tips and suggestions for organizing your Bash settings .
( You can apply similar strategies to other shells . )
If you have settings ( for example , PATH ) that you want to use in every shell ( regardless of its mode ) , place those settings in ~/. bashrc and use source to access the file from ~/.bash_profile .
to access the file from ~/.bash_profile .
If you have accounts on multiple machines ( and your home directory is n't shared among them through the Network File System [ NFS ] ) , use rsync to keep your shell startup files in sync across all machines on the network .
If you apply certain preferences depending on the host you 're using — say , a different PATH if one system has special resources — place those settings in a separate file and use source to access it during shell startup .
If you choose to use rsync to manage your files , omit the host - specific file from the file distribution list .
Of course , you can also create a global script and use conditionals and the environment variable HOSTNAME to choose the appropriate settings .
( HOSTNAME is set automatically by the shell and captures the fully qualified host name . )
For example , here 's a useful snippet commonly found in startup files : case $ HOSTNAME in lab.area51.org ) PATH=/opt/rocketscience/bin:$ PATH
PS1 = '\u @ \h \# \$ ' export $ PS1 ; ; alien.area51.org ) PATH=/opt/alien/sw/bin:$ PATH ; ; saucer * ) PATH=/opt/saucer/bin:$ PATH
PAGER=less export $ PAGER ; ; *) PATH=/usr/local/bin:$ PATH
esac export $ PATH
The construct here is a switch statement to compare the value of $ HOSTNAME against four possible values : lab.area51.org , alien.area51.org , a pattern that matches any hostnames that begin with the literal string saucer * ( a hostname such as saucer - mars would match ; a hostname such as sauce .
tomato.org would not ) , and everything else .
Here , in the case of Bash , the asterisk ( * ) is interpreted as a shell operator , not as a regular expression operator .
When a match is made against one of the patterns , the statements associated with that pattern execute .
Unlike other switch statements , Bash 's case runs one set of statements only .
Finally , look at the shell startup files of other users for inspiration and to save perspiration .
( Some users protect these files and their home directory , though , which precludes you from browsing . )
Does Joe have a cool , useful prompt ?
Ask how to implement the same thing .
Does Jeanette have extensive keyboard accelerators or a great collection of environment variables to eke out special features from utilities ?
Chat with her about her about recipes .
The best source of ideas and code comes from experienced practitioners of the command line .
Customizing your shell
Tweakers and modders , unite !
You can customize your shell extensively , and after you find a setting or series of settings you like , save them in a startup file to re-use again and again .
Use rsync or a similar tool to propagate your environment from one machine to another .
Your lesson is done .
Time for more katas .

Related to Fitt ’s law , it states that …

Bill Clinton tells Rush Limbaugh : ' You 're tan , fit , look good '
RAW STORY
Published : Thursday May 17 , 2007 Print This Email This
Hell did n't freeze over and pigs were n't spotted flying over the Manhattan skyline when two former arch - enemies ran into each other at a restaurant Wednesday night and opted to shake hands and exchange pleasantries rather than engage in mano a mano combat .
This afternoon , conservative pundit Rush Limbaugh told his listeners that he had an encounter with former President Bill Clinton at the Kobe Club steakhouse in New York City .
" This looming presence , I look up , and , golly , if it is n't former President Bill Clinton , " Limbaugh said .
" He 's got a big smile on his face , and I look up , and I imagine I was somewhat startled .
I looked up , and I could n't hear what he was saying because of the noise in there . "
Limbaugh added , " So I 'm turning my head , my left ear to him so I could hear a little bit more , and he said , ' You 're looking great .
You 're tan , fit , you look very good out there . '
I reached out my hand , ' Mr. President , it 's a pleasure to meet you . '
We shook hands and so forth , and he hung around for I guess two or three minutes , maybe five . "
Afterwards , Limbaugh and Clinton , who have both had fluctuating waistlines throughout the years , discussed what they had for dinner .
Limbaugh said , " Now , the former president is probably about ten feet up the sidewalk , and I decided I 'm going to go up , shake his hand and say good night .
Because I 'm a gentleman , I 'm not just going to walk out there and ignore him .
So I did .
I walked up .
I asked him what he had to eat .
He said , ( Clinton impression ) ' I had chicken .
I had fish .
That 's what we had . ' "
" Well , you were good , " Limbaugh said .
" You were good . "
" You gotta be good , man , gotta be good , " Clinton responded .
Limbaugh continued , " So I said , ' Nice to meet you , ' got back in a car , and drove off . "
Limbaugh spoke about how the conservative Drudge Report first reported the meeting , " There was no tension about any of this .
It was a good time , and I enjoyed it .
I enjoyed it -- especially when I looked over and I saw the former president intently chatting up the woman that I was with .
( Laughing . )
It was cool .
So , anyway , somehow Matt Drudge heard about this today .
So he 's had it blurbed on the Drudge Report for I guess an hour or two .
He said that he 's been talking to ' sources close Clinton ' who said , ' No , the former president did n't approach Rush .
That would never happen .
Rush approached the former president . '
I predicted this .
Somewhere in Clinton , Inc. , that 's the story .
I did approach him outside the restaurant when I was leaving to say good - bye .
I 'm not just going to ignore him on the sidewalk there .
They had photographers taking pictures of that , I 'm sure , but I was minding my business .
I did n't even know he was going to be there .
I was minding my own business like always , bothering nobody , sitting in the restaurant .
When he stopped at the table , that starts this whole story .
Then he brought the mayor over , and then Burkle came over , and it was amazing . "
Limbaugh closed the segment with a flashback to something he said during the Clinton presidency .
" I remember telling you this in the early to mid-nineties , ' Bill Clinton is the kind of guy that you probably would love to go to a ball game with , chase women afterwards and have a great time , " Limbaugh related .
" I 'm already getting e-mails , ' You 're falling in with the enemy .
I knew it !
It happens to every one of our conservatives .
They get famous , and fall in with the enemy , even you . ' "
Limbaugh asked , " What am I supposed to do , folks , when he comes to my table ?
Am I supposed to stand up and leave ?
Am I supposed to turn my back ?
What am I supposed to do ? "
" I 'm not that kind of person , " Limbaugh claimed .
" You people need to relax out there , some of you .
Not all of you are uptight about this .
Some of you need to just lighten up out there .
I can't help it if I go someplace and this kind of stuff happens . "

Do you still think it would be a good idea to have a computer run monetary policy ?
Friedman : Yes .
Of course it depends very much on how the computer is programmed .
I am not saying that any computer program would do .
In speaking of that , I have had in mind the idea that a computer would produce , for example , a constant rate of growth in the quantity of money as defined , let us say , by M2 , something like 3 % to 5 % per year .
There are certainly occasions in which discretionary changes in policy guided by a wise and talented manager of monetary policy would do better than the fixed rate , but they would be rare .
In any event , the computer program would certainly prevent any major disasters either way , any major inflation or any major depressions .
One of the great defects of our kind of monetary system is that its performance depends so much on the quality of the people who are put in charge .
We have seen that in the history of our own Federal Reserve System .
Surely a computer would have produced far better results during the 1930s and during both world wars .
That raises a question about the desirability of our present monetary system .
It is one in which a group of unelected people have enormous power , power which can lead to a great depression or which can lead to a great inflation .
Is it wise to have that power in those hands ?
An alternative would be to eliminate the Federal Reserve System ; to reduce the monetary activities of the federal government to the provision of high - powered money , that is , currency and bank reserves , and to constitutionalize , as it were , what is to be done with high - powered money .
My preference is simply to hold it constant and let financial developments produce the growth in the quantity of money in the form of bank deposits , a process that has been going on for many decades .
But that is , of course , politically impossible .
A Zimbabwean opposition spokesman and MP , Nelson Chamisa , was beaten unconscious yesterday at Harare airport as he was about to fly to Brussels , according to his party , the Movement for Democratic Change .
The attack followed the arrest of three other opposition leaders at the airport at the weekend and the snatching by government agents of the body of activist Gift Tandare , shot dead by police , to prevent a public funeral .
About 50 people including Morgan Tsvangirai , the opposition leader , were beaten and arrested while trying to attend a prayer rally eight days ago .
Zimbabwe 's president , Robert Mugabe , threatened more violence at the weekend , while Mr Tsvangirai pledged further resistance .
Mr Chamisa , 28 , spoke to the Guardian from hospital where he was awaiting surgery late yesterday .
Doctors said he may lose an eye from the assault , which took place in front of frightened travellers .
" Just as I was about to enter the door of the departure area , eight men jumped me and began hitting me with iron bars .
I just fell to the ground , " said Mr Chamisa .
" Nobody is safe in Zimbabwe .
There is no security , no rule of law .
I am praying for my country . "
Pearson Mangofa , an opposition MP who drove Mr Chamisa to the airport , said his assailants shoved away passengers who tried to help him .
The men grabbed Mr Chamisa 's passport , bags and laptop computer before speeding off in two cars , one without a licence plate .
Seven of them wore suits while one wore an army vest .
Mr Mangofa said the attack bore the hallmarks of Zimbabwe 's domestic spy agency , the Central Intelligence Organisation .
Mr Chamisa suffered " terrible injuries " to his head , jaw and right eye , said Mr Mangofa , who took him to hospital .
Mr Chamisa already had injuries to his groin and head from beatings in police custody last week with Mr Tsvangirai and others .
He was due to attend a European Union parliamentary conference in Brussels .
Two of the three MDC activists arrested at the airport on Saturday were attempting to leave the country for medical treatment for injuries received at the previous weekend 's prayer rally .
Sekai Holland and Grace Kwinjeh were taken by ambulance to the tarmac to board a flight to South Africa , but government agents seized their passports and took them back to the Avenues Clinic hospital , where they were under police guard last night .
Ms Holland , 64 , has a broken arm , a broken leg and an infection in deep tissue injuries .
Ms Kwinjeh , 30 , has lost part of her ear lobe and has head injuries .
The third person arrested was Arthur Mutambara , the leader of a breakaway faction of the MDC .
He was being held by Harare police yesterday , according to lawyers who were seeking his immediate release .
At the weekend armed government agents seized the body of Gift Tandare , an MDC member who was shot dead by police on March 10 .
The men took Mr Tandare 's coffin from a funeral parlour for a secret burial to prevent a public ceremony that had been scheduled for today and would have been attended by hundreds of mourners .
Mr Mugabe claimed that the UK and the US were backing the MDC in order to overthrow his government , according to the government - controlled Sunday Mail newspaper .
" We have given too much room to mischief - makers and shameless stooges of the west .
Let them and their masters know that we shall brook none of their lawless behaviour , " said Mr Mugabe , who warned that his government would be provoked to " measures which they will regret " .
Mr Tsvangirai , however , said Zimbabwe was facing a critical moment that could bring positive change .
" Things are bad , but I think that this crisis has reached a tipping point and we could see the beginning of the end of this dictatorship , " he told the BBC .
The integrated market will come into force in 2009
France , Germany , Belgium , Luxembourg and the Netherlands aim to create a single integrated electricity market by 1 January , 2009 .
European Union Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs said the deal would mean lower prices for consumers .
He added that it would also increase security of electricity supply .
Make it easier
At present not much electricity is sold across European borders .
The current problem is that buying electricity from another country is a time consuming , two - fold operation .
Firstly the nation in question has to buy the electricity , and then it has to buy the capacity , or space on the grid , to transport it .
The supply of electricity in Europe became a major issue last November when a massive power cut in Germany temporarily hit supplies across the continent .

But then I went back yesterday , and the photos were up .
Oh my god , I 'm going to hurl .
Yeah , this is one nasty woman .
And the reality is , these are photos that she posted of herself !
Whenever I see something like this , I have a sort of Jerry Springer - esque reaction , hoping that this is fake , then instantly realizing that there are people like this all over the country .
Take a look for yourself :
I was checking out Joe Rogan 's website a few days ago , where he was talking about how great it felt to have such a ton of public support after his favorite club and agent both dropped him .
He also said that a few folks have been less than gracious , and included a nasty note that some woman had left him on his myspace page .
As you might expect from a comedian who 's got a reputation for annihilating hecklers , Rogan goes off .
There were some jpg 's pasted in to show the woman , and Joe Rogan points out that this is what a Carlos Mencia fan looks like .
The jpg's were broken , and I wondered if that was a part of the whole DMCA bullshit that was going on at the time .
But then I went back yesterday , and the photos were up .
Oh my god , I 'm going to hurl .
Yeah , this is one nasty woman .
And the reality is , these are photos that she posted of herself !
Whenever I see something like this , I have a sort of Jerry Springer - esque reaction , hoping that this is fake , then instantly realizing that there are people like this all over the country .
Take a look for yourself :
This woman looks like she 's bobbing for fried ice cream .
I think that stripper had a cheeseburger in his thong to induce that kind of feeding frenzy from this woman .
It 's just all too awful ... the feathered hair , the ' 80s Tootsie glasses , the ' glandular issues ' .... ugh .
And that poor stripper ... he looks like he 's going to be asphyxiated between that woman 's thighs .
And the saddest thing of all is that you just know that this is the one of the hottest sexual experiences of this woman 's life .
A part of me really wants to know who this woman is .
I thought about trying to track down her myspace profile , but let 's face it , my tolerance for interminable page loads is almost nil .
My first reaction is nausea .
Then I feel just awful thinking about her life .
Then I just get kind of angry .
I mean , who the hell is this woman to proffer her useless opinion on someone else 's life ?!?!
What the fuck gives her the right to be anyone 's barometer of acceptability ?!?!?
Why is this fucking failure of a human being out in the world trying to tell other people anything at all ?!?!?!
For the record , here 's the precious note that she decided to send to Joe Rogan : First of all , it makes sense that this bottom - feeder would feel uplifted by Carlos ... he's an even bigger loser .
All of that fake hispanican humor probably feeds right into the bigoted pseudo - jokes she and her trashy friends tell in the vast industrial cafeteria of whatever assembly line she works on .
Plus , if she were a good christian , she 'd offer up that free meal herself .
I 'm just saying ... But this woman is just one more example of a repetitive theme .
If we measure human beings on a scale of 1 - 10 for their intelligence , worth , contributions to the world ... any number of characteristics that we as a society claim to hold dear , this woman would be a 2 or 3 at best .
Yet she 's coming into the fray like she 's way higher on the food chain .
Like she actually has something to offer that the world wants .
On the opposite end of the spectrum , you 'll almost always hear a beautiful girl admit that she thinks she 's ' plain ' rather than pretty ; a highly intelligent person will tells you that he or she is ' just average ' .
Because the truth is , people with some sense of themselves and the world around them know that there is always someone out there who is smarter , better looking , or more competent on a number of levels .
Yet the dregs of society shamelessly present themselves as if they are the standard by which the bar is set .
Ask a 400 - pound woman in spandex how she looks and you 'll hear " I look good ! "
Ask someone who 's never traveled more than an hour outside of the town that they grew up in , much less say visited a foreign country , and they 'll expound for hours on foreign policy .
Ask a person who 's never in his life handled his own finances with any aplomb , and he 'll be glad to tell you how the American economy works and where it falls short .
This woman is one of those people .
A bottom - feeder with too much confidence .
Maybe there 's something about being on the lower half of the scale of humanity that does n't allow for any sense of shame .
Maybe there 's some human defense mechanism that allows them to inherently believe they 're much better than they are and thus prevent them from committing suicide en masse .
For the rest of us , there 's not much gray area .
It boggles the mind that these folks can't see it in themselves , but we all know they 're losers .
The fact that this woman does n't " care if he steals shit from other people " speaks volumes about her character , even without the ghastly photos .
Hopefully some of this backlash will get back to her , and she might start to realize just how fucking pathetic she really is .

Welcome into the lounge , the place to relax and get to know the other regulars .
" I had to get permission from work , " said Regina Iannuzzi , 23 , in line since 6:20 a.m. on a recent morning .
She 'd been looking for a Wii , a 25th birthday present for her brother , for two weeks .
Every place was sold out .
Like sleeping in ?
Wiis are also available online , but at a hefty premium to the console 's $ 250 retail price .
A slightly used one from an Amazon.com seller called " Hard - To - Find - Stuff " recently listed for $ 595 plus $ 3.99 shipping .
Another cost $ 398 from a different seller .
" The PlayStation 1 was certainly a big introduction , but I do n't recall any game system more than six months after its launch still having this kind of demand , " said Chris Byrne , an independent toy analyst .
Back in April , Nintendo President Satoru Iwata acknowledged an " abnormal " Wii shortage .
Since then , the company has increased production " substantially " to help meet worldwide demand , said spokeswoman Perrin Kaplan .
But Nintendo also has to manage its inventory , said Colin Sebastian , an analyst with Lazard Capital Markets .
" Unfortunately you can't ask a contract manufacturer to make a million a month , then 5 million , " he said .
Sony's PS3 , which launched within days of the Wii last fall , is readily available in stores and online , but sales have been lagging behind the Wii .
Cost could be one reason for this : the PS3 retails for up to $ 600 .
More than 2.8 million
Wii consoles have sold in the U.S. since the November debut , according to the NPD Group , a market research company .
That 's more than double the number of PlayStation 3 consoles sold .
And Nintendo plans to sell 14 million worldwide in the current fiscal year , which ends next March .
" You see it and you want it .
Kind of like the iPhone , " said Robert Marcus , waiting to buy a Wii with his wife and three young sons .
Nintendo's selling point for the Wii has been that it's for everyone : not just hardcore gamers or young men with impeccable hand - eye coordination .
Its intuitive motion - sensitive wireless controller lets players mimic movements for bowling , tennis or sword - fighting instead of pushing complex combinations of buttons .
Twelve - year - old Gabriel Benitez , in town from Florida visiting his grandmother , stood in line outside Nintendo 's flagship New York store .
" We finally got enough money for it , " he said , glancing at his grandmother who was waiting with him .
" The last two stores were sold out . "
Gabriel likes the Wii's wireless controller and the mini - workout he gets while playing a game .
" I just hate what you have to do just to get one , " he said .
It 's not just kids who want it .
Rein Auh , 30 , never owned a console , but he decided to buy a Wii so he and his wife could have some fun and get some exercise .
He spent $ 350 at the Nintendo store on a Wii and some extras .
Walking out of the store , he looked back at the crowd of people still waiting .
" It 's kind of crazy , " he said .
" I mean , it 's been 7 months . "
For its part , Nintendo says demand for the consoles has absolutely exceeded expectations .
" We are trying to move them as fast as we can , " Kaplan said .
Demand for video games usually soars around the holidays and tapers off for the rest of the year .
Not with the Wii .
" People are looking at it as something they really want to have in their home , " said Byrne , the toy analyst .
This means people are n't just buying them as gifts , and the shopping frenzy usually reserved for the holiday season has stretched into the summer .
Toys " R " Us gets regular Wii shipments in all its stores around the country , but demand is so great they sell out immediately , said spokeswoman Kathleen Waugh .
On the toy store chain 's website , the consoles have usually been " temporarily not available . "
On a Sunday morning in Brooklyn 's Bensonhurst neighborhood , the Toys " R " Us opened an hour early for Wii buyers only .
Though nothing like the bustle of Manhattan , a small line of teenagers , 20 - somethings and families formed outside as a clerk handed out numbered slips of paper .
Inside the store , like two weeks earlier at the Best Buy across the shopping centre 's parking lot , the systems did n't even make it to the shelves before they sold out .
At some point , of course , supply will catch up with demand .
But some analysts do n't see this happening until next year .
" I do n't think by the holidays , " Sebastian said .
" But maybe by the middle of next year , perhaps they can add another production line . "

John McCain 's campaign has said it has only $ 2 m cash on hand
Their departure , coming a week after a shake - up of his campaign following disappointing fundraising results , is likely to be a blow for Mr McCain .
He has been trailing in polls to former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney .
In the Senate , Mr McCain defended the US troop build - up in Iraq , the stance analysts say has cost him most support .
Mr McCain said reinforcements were only just in place and should be given more time , echoing the message of President George W Bush and senior US military commanders .
" Make no mistake .
Violence in Baghdad remains at unacceptably high levels , " he said , speaking after his sixth visit to the country .
But , he contended , the efforts of the US and Iraq were " moving in the right direction " .
Staff cuts
Mr McCain's Senate address coincided with the announcement that campaign manager Terry Nelson , a veteran of President George W Bush 's 2004 campaign , and chief strategist John Weaver had quit .
Longtime aide Rick Davis has taken over as manager .
Following last week 's news of Mr McCain 's $ 11.2 m fundraising total for the second quarter of 2007 , Mr Nelson had said he was working for free to save money .
The senator revealed that he had only $ 2 m cash on hand and dozens of staff reportedly lost their jobs in the ensuing shake - up of his operation .
By comparison , Mr Romney announced a second - quarter fundraising total of $ 20.5 m ( £ 10.2 m ) , of which $ 14 m ( £ 7 m ) was money raised for primary campaigning and $ 6.5 m was a loan from his personal fortune .
Aides to Mr Giuliani said he had more than $ 18 m cash in hand and no debt .
For the Democrats , Barack Obama reported raising $ 31 m for the primary battle , putting him ahead of Hillary Clinton with $ 21 m for the primary and another $ 6 m for the general election .
Republican Ron Paul , an anti-war congressman from Texas considered an outside chance for the Republican nomination but with loyal online supporters , announced he had $ 2.4 m on hand , having raised less but also spent far less than Mr McCain .

" Claim a difference between the parties on the voters ' chances of survival -- and you do Osama Bin Laden 's work for him .
And we -- Democrats and Republicans alike , and every variation in between -- We -- Americans ! -- are sick to death , of you and the other terror - mongers , trying to frighten us into submission , into the surrender of our rights and our reason , into this betrayal of that for which this country has always stood . "
( transcript below the fold ... )
Finally tonight , a Special Comment about Rudolf Giuliani's remarks at a Lincoln Day Dinner in New Hampshire last night .
Since some indeterminable hour between the final dousing of the pyre at The World Trade Center , and the breaking of what Senator Obama has aptly termed " 9/11 Fever , " it has been profoundly and disturbingly evident that we are at the center of one of history 's great ironies .
Only in this America of the early 21st Century could it be true , that the man who was president during the worst attack on our nation , and the man who was the mayor of the city in which that attack principally unfolded , would not only be absolved of any and all blame for the unreadiness of their own governments , but , more over , would thereafter be branded heroes of those attacks .
And now , that Mayor - whose most profound municipal act in the wake of that nightmare was to suggest the postponement of the election to select his own successor - has gone even a step beyond these M.C. Escher constructions of history .
" If any Republican is elected president - and I think obviously I would be best at this - we will remain on offense and will anticipate what ( the terrorists ) will do and try to stop them before they do it . "
Insisting that the election of any Democrat would mean the country was " back ... on defense , " Mr. Giuliani continued :
" But the question is how long will it take and how many casualties will we have .
If we are on defense , we will have more losses and it will go on longer . "
He said this with no sense of irony , no sense of any personal shortcomings , no sense whatsoever .
And if you somehow missed what he was really saying , somehow did n't hear the none - too - subtle subtext of ' vote Democratic and die , ' Mr. Giuliani then stripped away any barrier of courtesy , telling Roger Simon of Politico .
Com , quote ...
" America will be safer with a Republican president . "
At least that Republican President under which we have not been safer ... has , even at his worst , maintained some microscopic distance between himself , and a campaign platform that blithely threatened the American people with " casualties " if they , next year , elect a Democratic president - or , inferring from Mr. Giuliani 's flights of grandeur in New Hampshire - even if they elect a different Republican .
How dare you , sir ?
" How many casualties will we have ? " - this is the language of Bin Laden .
Yours , Mr. Giuliani , is the same chilling nonchalance of the madman , of the proselytizer who has moved even from some crude framework of politics and society , into a virtual Roman Colosseum of carnage , and a conceit over your own ability -- and worthiness -- to decide , who lives and who dies .
Rather than a reasoned discussion -- rather than a political campaign advocating your own causes and extolling your own qualifications -- you have bypassed all the intermediate steps , and moved directly to trying to terrorize the electorate into viewing a vote for a Democrat , not as a reasonable alternative and an inalienable right ... but as an act of suicide .
This is not the mere politicizing of Iraq , nor the vague mumbled epithets about Democratic ' softness ' from a delusional Vice President .
This is casualties on a partisan basis -- of the naked assertion that Mr. Giuliani 's party knows all and will save those who have voted for it -- and to hell with everybody else .
And that he , with no foreign policy experience whatsoever , is somehow the Messiah - of - the - moment .
Even to grant that that formula - whether posed by Republican or Democrat - is somehow not the most base , the most indefensible , the most Un - American electioneering in our history - even if it is somehow acceptable to assign " casualties " to one party and ' safety ' to the other - even if we have become so profane in our thinking that it is part of our political vocabulary to view counter - terror as one party 's property and the other 's liability ... on what imaginary track record does Mr. Giuliani base his boast ?
Which party held the presidency on September 11th , 2001 , Mr. Giuliani ?
Which party held the mayoralty of New York on that date , Mr. Giuliani ?
Which party assured New Yorkers that the air was safe , and the remains of the dead , recovered - and not being used to fill pot-holes , Mr. Giuliani ?
Which party wanted what the terrorists wanted - the postponement elections - and to whose personal advantage would that have redounded , Mr. Giuliani ?
Which mayor of New York was elected eight months after the first attack on the World Trade Center , yet did not emphasize counter - terror in the same city for the next eight years , Mr. Giuliani ?
Which party had proposed to turn over the Department of Homeland Security to Bernard Kerik , Mr. Giuliani ?
Who wanted to ignore and hide Kerik 's Organized Crime allegations , Mr. Giuliani ?
Who personally argued to the White House that Kerik need not be vetted , Mr. Giuliani ?
Which party rode roughshod over Americans ' rights while braying that it was actually protecting them , Mr. Giuliani ?
Which party took this country into the most utterly backwards , utterly counter - productive , utterly ruinous war in our history , Mr. Giuliani ?
Which party has been in office as more Americans were killed in the pointless fields of Iraq , than were killed in the consuming nightmare of 9/11 , Mr. Giuliani ?
Drop this argument , sir .
You will lose it .
" The Democrats do not understand the full nature and scope of the terrorist war against us , " Mr. Giuliani continued to the Rockingham County Lincoln Day Dinner last night .
" Never , ever again will this country be on defense waiting for ( terrorists ) to attack us , if I have anything to say about it .
And make no mistake , the Democrats want to put us back on defense . "
There is no room for this .
This is terrorism itself , dressed up as counter - terrorism .
It is not warning , but bullying - substituted for the political discourse now absolutely essential to this country 's survival and the freedom of its people .
No Democrat has said words like these .
None has ever campaigned on the Republicans ' flat - footedness of September 11th , 2001 .
None has the requisite , irresponsible , all - consuming , ambition .
None is willing to say " I Accuse , " rather than recognize that , to some degree , all of us share responsibility for our collective stupor .
And if it is somehow insufficient , that this is morally , spiritually , and politically wrong , to screech as Mr. Giuliani has screeched ... there is also this : that gaping hole in Mr. Giuliani 's argument of ' Republicans equal life ; Democrats equal death . '
Not only have the Republicans not lived up to their babbling on this subject , but last fall the electorate called them on it .
As doubtless they would call you on it , Mr. Giuliani .
Repeat , go beyond Mr. Bush 's rhetorical calamities of 2006 .
Call attention to the casualties on your watch , and your long , waking slumber in the years between the two attacks on the World Trade Center .
Become the candidate who runs on the Vote - For - Me - Or - Die platform .
Do a Joe McCarthy , a Lyndon Johnson , a Robespierre .
Only , if you choose so to do , do not come back surprised nor remorseful if the voters remind you that " terror " is not just a matter of " casualties . "
It is , just as surely , a matter of the promulgation of fear .
Claim a difference between the parties on the voters ' chances of survival -- and you do Osama Bin Laden 's work for him .
And we -- Democrats and Republicans alike , and every variation in between -- We -- Americans ! -- are sick to death , of you and the other terror - mongers , trying to frighten us into submission , into the surrender of our rights and our reason , into this betrayal of that for which this country has always stood .
Franklin Roosevelt 's words ring true again tonight .
And , clarified and amplified , they are just as current now , as they were when first he spoke them , 74 years ago .
" We have nothing to fear but fear itself " -- and those who would exploit our fear , for power , and for their own personal , selfish , cynical , gain .
Good night , and good luck .

The scale of the obesity crisis was laid bare last night when an alarming report revealed Britons are the fattest people in Europe .
A quarter of women and a fifth of men in the UK are now so overweight that their health is at serious risk .
British women head the EU league , with 23 per cent clinically obese , and men fare little better , with 22.3 per cent classified as obese - behind only Malta .
The shocking figures , compiled by the British women are now officially the most overweight in Europe and men are n't far behind
EU 's statistical office , will fuel fears that Britain is facing a public health timebomb created by a growing reliance on fast food and time - saving technology .
Experts say that unless the Government acts now , an entire generation faces an old age blighted by heart disease , cancer , diabetes and other diseases brought on by obesity .
Neville Rigby , of the International Obesity Task Force , said : ' We are not just sitting on a health timebomb , we are watching it go off . '
And Dr Colin Waine , of the National Obesity Forum , said : ' The health risks are tremendous but the statistics are still going up exponentially .
' We need the Government to work with food manufacturers to produce a diet which is nutritious but less dense in sugar , salt and fat .
' We need to make motorised transport less necessary and make it easier for people to walk and bicycle to where they need to go . '
The authoritative Eurostat yearbook places Britain at the top of a chart of obesity of the EU 's 27 member countries .
Second and third place are taken by Germany and Malta .
Breaking the data down by gender shows that British women are the fattest in Europe , with almost a quarter at least two to three stone over their ideal weight .
German women have an obesity rate of 21.7 per cent and Maltese women 21.2 per cent .
The thinnest women are in Italy , where fewer than 8 per cent are obese .
The highest rate of male obesity is in Malta , with 25.1 per cent obese .
British men are second with a rate of 22.3 per cent , followed by Hungary and Germany .
Romania has the best record on male obesity , with just 7.7 per cent obese .
Measured by calculating Body Mass Index - a mathematical formula relating height to weight - people are classified as obese if they weigh a fifth more than their ideal maximum weight .
The EU statisticians looked only at adult obesity , but previous studies have shown rates of child obesity are equally worrying .
In Britain the figures have trebled in 20 years , with 10 per cent of six - year - olds and 17 per cent of 15 - year - olds now obese .
Adult obesity rates have nearly quadrupled over the last 25 years , making Britain the second - fattest nation in the developed world , trailing behind only America .
Obesity causes 9,000 premature deaths a year and costs the NHS up to £ 1 billion .
Being obese can take nine years off a person 's lifespan and raise the risk of a host of health problems including diabetes , heart disease , stroke , infertility and depression .
Various cancers , including breast , colon , kidney and stomach cancer , are known to be linked to weight .
A spokesman for the British Heart Foundation said : ' Being overweight or obese is a serious risk factor for heart disease and something we all need to work to sort out .
' The good thing is that there are lots of things people can do to make a difference such as combining healthy eating and activity . '
LibDem health spokesman Norman Lamb said : ' To be bottom of the European league table is a dire situation to be in .
Although food manufacturers have made some progress in making foods healthier , more needs to be done . '
Previous Government drives to cut obesity included offering dance classes on the NHS .
In November , TV watchdog Ofcom announced a ban on junk food adverts during programmes targeted at under -16s .
The Department of Health also plans to weigh children when they start school and send letters home if they are too fat .
The average Briton eats just over three portions of fruit and vegetables a day - well under the recommended five portions a day - and will get through 22,000 ready - meals , sandwiches and sweet snacks in a lifetime - little short of one a day .
Evolution has graced the Earth with a multitude of different species , and with them an array of genitalia that make the human frank - and - beans look like , well , frank and beans by comparison .
Here 's a list of some of the most interesting ones I 've come across .
6 ) - Despite spending it 's entire lifetime bathed in frigid seawater , the barnacle does n't suffer from shrinkage .
On the contrary , the Dirk Diggler of the animal kingdom has a penis up to 50 times it 's body length - making it the world 's largest penis , relative to size .
The reason size DOES matter ?
They 're immobile and need the length to reach their mates .5 ) -
We 've talked about interesting penis shapes before with the corkscrew penis of certain ducks .
Pigs also have a corkscrew penis , but why go for a single freakshow when you can double your pleasure instead ?
Like many marsupials , the kangaroo has a bifurcated ( or forked ) penis , and the scrotum and testes are in the front .
This matches the dual vaginas / uteri of female marsupials .
Stranger still , the echidna penis ( pictured ) has 4 heads !
4 ) - The dolphin , like some other cetaceans , has a retractable penis that is also prehensile , meaning it can grab , hold and wrap around an object ( think monkey tail ) .
Imagine the benefits of such an appendage !
This guy did .
But what 's even more disturbing , is this joke faq about how to have sex with a dolphin .
At least I hope it 's a joke .3 ) -
This specialized octopus can use its penis without having physical contact with a female .
Like many cephalopods , the penis is a special tentacle called the hectocotylus .
In the case of the argonaut it detaches and swims to its mate , embedding in the female and impregnating her .
2 ) - Like any man , the male honeybee climaxes with an explosion .
Unlike men , the male bee genitals literally explode and snap off inside the queen .
Afterwards , the males do what any of us would if our testes exploded and our penis snapped off - they wander off to the corner and die .
A similar phenomenon has also been observed in certain spiders .
The evolutionary rationale is that the detached genitals act as a plug preventing other males from mating with the queen1 ) -
The bedbug does n't mess around with foreplay .
In fact it does n't even mess around with female genitals .
Instead , the male uses its dagger - like johnson to pierce the body of the female and inseminate her .
The bedbug is n't the only species with such a violent mating process .
Hermaphroditic flatworms duel with their penises with the loser being pierced and becoming pregnant .
I see your Schwartz is as big as mine !

It was the find of a lifetime -- a Picasso buried under another Picasso .
Now they 're both on view at SFMOMA .
1 / 4 Back to Gallery
Will Shank always suspected something was buried beneath Picasso's " Scène de Rue , " a somber street scene painted by the precocious 19 - year - old Spanish artist in the fall of 1900 during his first stay in Paris .
Some of the brushwork does n't line up with the figures and stands out from the comparatively smooth surface of this small painting , which is in the collection of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art , where Shank was chief conservator for many years .
And hairline cracks in the surface reveal bits of bright orange , red and emerald green that seem at odds with the picture 's muted grays and browns .
Shank 's suspicions were confirmed in 1997 , when " Scène de Rue " was loaned to the National Gallery of Art in Washington , D.C. , for an exhibition of Picasso 's early works .
As a matter of course , National Gallery conservator Ann Hoenigswald , a Picasso lover who had often X - rayed his paintings to better understand his methods , exposed all the works in the show to infrared light and X - radiography .
She 'd seen images beneath other Picassos before , but examining " Scène de Rue " was a revelation :
Under the surface was a complete picture .
It appeared to be a cabaret scene .
For a conservator , " it was a discovery of a lifetime , " says Shank , who later organized an intriguing little exhibition about the find , " Hidden Picasso , " on view at SFMOMA 's Koret Visitor Education Center .
It includes a full - color digital reconstruction of the can - can dance hall scene beneath " Scène de Rue . "
Shank 's research and consultation with other conservators and curators convinced him that the picture " hidden " under " Scène de Rue " was a prototype for what some consider Picasso's first masterpiece , " Le Moulin de la Galette , " a Lautrec - like painting of a Parisian boite .
Owned by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York , it depicts an unsavory club where men in top hats and white cravats mingle with plume - hatted ladies of the night .
Picasso ( 1881 - 1973 ) painted it during the fall of 1900 , a prolific period in which he produced several other works focusing on the Parisian nightlife previously portrayed by Toulouse - Lautrec and Renoir .
Working with SFMOMA interactive media specialist Tim Svenonius , Shank took high - definition digital photographs of " Scène de Rue " to capture the colors visible through the cracks , then meticulously transferred them to a black - and - white radiograph of the underlying forms to reconstruct the buried picture .
" This has never been done before , " says Shank , a tall , genial man with a trim goatee , standing in front of the digital Picasso .
It 's displayed in a light box so there is no pretense that it 's actually a painting .
The reconstruction required a degree of educated guesswork -- Shank used similar Picasso works from the same period as a color guide -- but the conservator thinks it 's close to what the artist originally painted before he decided , for whatever reason , to cover it over with a completely different picture .
" If I had to quantify it , I 'd say we got 90 percent of Picasso's palette and 95 percent of his shapes , " says Shank , who now lives in Picasso's hometown of Barcelona and works as an independent conservator and curator .
SFMOMA supported the effort , which was done here , but the funding came from the Bilbao Guggenheim , where " Hidden Picasso " was first shown in 2004 .
There , the digital reconstruction was exhibited alongside " Le Moulin de la Galette , " loaned from the Guggenheim in New York , and SFMOMA 's " Scène de Rue . "
For security and climate - control reasons , the installation at the Koret Center uses reproductions of the paintings .
But there 's a cool interactive video about the digital reconstruction process ( accessible online at www.sfmoma.org/hiddenpicasso) and film footage of Paris in 1900 shot by Thomas Edison .
The real " Scène de Rue " is on display just around the corner in the second - floor galleries .
Picasso was famous for reworking and transforming his images and was known to repaint canvases .
" It 's not something he did to save money as a young , struggling artist , he did this his whole life , " Shank says .
He mentions Henri-Georges Clouzot 's 1956 film " The Mystery of Picasso , " in which the artist , painting on glass , " turns a still life into a woman , and a woman into a bull , then turns the bull into a flower .
This was like a game he played to make the subject matter of his painting continuously evolve until he had what he considered a final product .
But he often left clues on the surface .
So you could tell there was something under there . "
Nobody knows why Picasso painted over the cabaret scene , with its cancan dancers , women in red dresses and top - hatted gentlemen ( in " Le Moulin de Galette , " couples are dancing , not just watching ) .
Shank conjectures that the painter wanted to recast the scene on a larger scale .
" Scène de Rue " is only 2 - by - 3 feet ; " Le Moulin de Galette " is four times that size .
" He loved the image , he was a habitue of the cancan nightclubs , " Shanks says .
" He drew the patrons , the dancers , repeatedly in his first several visits to Paris .
He loved the idea .
It seems to me likely that he wanted to make a bigger statement . "
Shank spent a lot of time staring at the 8 - by - 10 - inch X - rays Hoenigs - wald sent him before he hit on the idea of trying to reconstruct the full picture , which he and others familiar with Picasso's work of the period assumed was a " moulin something , " as he puts it .
Then a lightbulb went on : Because you could see virtually all the colors through the cracks , why not apply them to the black and white radiograph and make a color image ?
He and Svenonius first looked at " Scène de Rue " through a binocular microscope .
Even without the microscope , some of the colors were easily visible with the naked eye , Svenonius says .
" There 's this red - orange that 's kind of sprinkled throughout , and a kind of emerald green , and a salmon color that leap out at you because the surface painting is predominately brown and gray . "
The major step was taking high - definition digital photographs of the entire surface of " Scène de Rue , " then transferring the colors onto the X -ray , whose skeletal shapes were brought into sharper focus .
" We took small samples , say 1 - inch square , and superimposed them on the black - and - white X - ray , finding the exact location of that patch , " says Shank , who spent a couple of months on the project .
" Hundreds of thousands of tiny specks of color were sampled directly from the digital files of the visible painting . "
Some things were easy , like the hats and dresses .
But even those required a degree of extrapolation .
For example , if there were specks of orange - red in a dress , the team surmised the whole dress was that color .
The flesh tones and the dark foreground and background were far more difficult to figure out .
" There were moments when we would come up with green for flesh tones and think , ' there 's something wrong with the equipment or with us , ' " Shank says .
" But in fact , there are some unusual things in the painting . "
He points to the reproduction of " Le Moulin de la Galette " and says : " We 're not talking realistic flesh tones here .
This is how Picasso painted in 1900 .
There are extremely abstracted faces and other elements .
This was his palette .
So it 's not too huge a leap of faith to assume that this other painting of such a similar subject was painted with very similar colors . "
Based on the scarcity of underlying color and bold brushstrokes on the right side of the canvas , they concluded that Picasso did n't finish the whole scene .
" The only thing we had to finally guess at were the backgrounds , that brown color there , " Shank says .
Adds Svenonius : " We found little specks of the ochre up top , and specks of that green gray down below , and we had to say , ' Well , maybe it was broad wash over the whole area . ' "
Shanks is amazed that Picasso simply did n't white out the underlying painting with gesso and give himself a blank canvas for " Scène de Rue . "
The artist was so visually acute , he says , that he was able to paint over the " hidden " picture piece by piece and create an entirely new image .
Perhaps the most intriguing figure in the underlying picture is a black - cloaked woman off the left side .
Most likely she 's " La Celestina , " the procuress in Spanish art and literature who arranges sexual trysts .
" There 's certainly enough there that you can image what the painting would 've looked like before he covered it up , " Svenonius says .
" That was our goal , not to pretend that this is a Picasso . "
For Shank , the reconstruction job was a way to further our understanding of the artist and his process , " and how things evolved from one thing to another for probably the most important artist of the 20th century .
It was thrilling to have a part in bringing this to light for the first time in 100 years .
Picasso did leave clues , but certainly did n't envision the technical possibilities that would be available to us at the end of the 20th century .
I think he would be tickled . "

THE cost of filling up a Honda Civic 's 50 - litre tank varies hugely around the world .
Where some countries subsidise , others tax heavily .
Pity Turkish drivers , who fork out $ 93.83 , according to Gerhard Metschies in Foreign Policy magazine .
Re-nationalised oil companies and heavy subsidies keep Venezuelan motorists happy , though those in Turkmenistan fare even better , paying only $ 1.06 a tank .
Despite protests over rising prices , filling up in America is relatively cheap at $ 31.06 .
Indeed , this may explain the country 's enormous daily petrol consumption , which in 2003 was more than the next 20 biggest consumers combined .
Although consumption will have increased in some countries since then , particularly in China , it is nonetheless easy to see why George Bush has introduced a plan to cut petrol consumption by 20 % in the next ten years .

Gonzales ' top deputy closes ranks in prepared statement for Thursday hearing Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday June 20 , 2007 Print This Email This
The outgoing top deputy to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales will close ranks with his embattled boss in testimony to be delivered at the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday .
The Deputy Attorney General , Paul McNulty , who recently resigned , insisted in his prepared remarks that no wrongdoing occurred in the course of the Justice Department 's responses to a Congressional probe into the firing of a group of US Attorneys .
But his remarks left unanswered some key questions about his role in the firing of 8 US Attorneys .
McNulty acknowledged that he had made remarks to Congress in the past based on an incomplete understanding of events .
" We have learned that my knowledge at the time I testified about the replacement of the U.S. Attorneys was in some respects incomplete .
I want to be clear today , however , that at all times , I have sought to provide Congress with the truth .
And I also want to be clear that I do not believe , and have never believed , that anyone in the Department of Justice set out to mislead me so that I might provide Congress with inaccurate information about this matter , " McNulty will say in his introductory statement tomorrow .
A copy of his brief prepared remarks , which are set to be delivered at noon before Rep. Linda Sanchez 's Subcommittee on Commerical Administrative Law , were sent to RAW STORY .
He went on to claim that any controversy was the result of errors , and not an effort to lie to Congress .
" To the contrary , I believe that the thousands of documents that have been produced demonstrate only that in the weeks before my testimony , many in the Department struggled with the question of how best to provide Congress with accurate information about the removals of the U.S. Attorneys , consistent with our efforts to protect the reputations of the U.S. Attorneys involved , " he claimed .
McNulty also insisted that there were no partisan political interests involved in any Justice Department prosecutions throughout the course of the Bush administration .
" It is important for this Committee and the public to know that when it comes to enforcing the law , Justice Department employees are blind to partisan politics , " he will assert in his prepared remarks .
" It plays no role in the Departments actions .
The law enforcement professionals , lawyers , and staff at DOJ check their politics at the door and investigate and prosecute cases based strictly on the facts and the law . "
The Deputy Attorney General 's prepared remarks seem unlikely to ward off several specific concerns that will be raised by Democratic Members of Congress in the Thursday hearing .
For example , many Congress members are likely to question him on the claims of Monica Goodling , former White House Liaison in the Justice Department .
She told Congressional investigators that McNulty was not forthright when he spoke in a closed - door briefing with Congress members in February .
" I believe the Deputy was not fully candid about his knowledge of White House involvement in the replacement decision , failed to disclose that he had some knowledge of the White House 's interest in selecting Tim Griffin as interim US Attorney in the Eastern District of Arkansas , inaccurately described the Department 's internal assessment of the [ bipartisan commission that selects Attorneys in California ] , and failed to disclose that he had some knowledge of allegations that Tim Griffin had been involved in ' vote caging ' in the President 's 2004 campaign , " she said in her May 23 appearance before the House Judiciary Committee .
McNulty 's prepared remarks also do not address Gonzales 's allegation in a May 15 press conference that the Deputy Attorney General made many of the key decisions about which US Attorneys were added to the list of those who were fired .
" Mr. McNulty was a former colleague of all of these United States attorneys , and so he would probably know better than anyone else about the performance and the qualifications of these -- of our United States attorney community ...
My understanding was was that Mr. Sampson 's recommendations reflected a consensus view of the senior leadership of the department , in particular the deputy attorney general , " the Attorney General said in the appearance .
RAW STORY will provide full coverage of Thursday 's hearing .
In related news , the House Judiciary Committee announced that it was launching a new website , ' Write Congress to Right Justice , ' in order to help whistleblowers in the Justice Department securely disclose information they would like to share with Congressional investigators .
" We have heard through intermediaries that current and former Justice Department whistleblowers needed a means to securely and confidentially communicate with the Committee , " Rep. John Conyers , the Committee 's Chairman , said in a statement .
" This page is designed to allows those whistleblowers to get the truth about the Department to the American people . "
If Public Libraries Didn’t Exist , Could You Start One Today ?
Raise your hand if you hate libraries .
Even though this blog does n’t enable me to peer through the screen into your living room ( yet ) , I am guessing there are n’t a lot of raised hands out there .
Who could possibly hate libraries ?
Here ’s one guess : book publishers .
I am probably wrong on this , but if you care about books , hear me out .
I had lunch recently with a few publishing folks .
One of them had just returned from a national librarians ’ conference , where it was her job to sell her line of books to as many librarians as possible .
She said that there were as many as 20,000 librarians in attendance ; she also said that if she got one big library system , like Chicago ’s or New York ’s , to buy a book , that could mean a sale of as many as a few hundred copies , since many library branches carry several copies of each book .
That sounds great , does n’t it ?
Well … maybe not .
Among writers , there is a very common lament : someone comes up to you at a book signing and says , “ Oh , I loved your book so much , I got it from the library and then told all my friends to go to the library too ! ”
And the writer thinks , “ Gee , thanks , but why did n’t you buy it ? ”
The library bought its copy , of course .
But let ’s say 50 people will read that copy over the life of the book .
If the library copy had n’t existed , surely not all 50 of those people would have bought the book .
But imagine that even 10 people would have .
That ’s 9 additional book sales lost by the writer and the publisher .
There ’s another way to look at it , of course .
Beyond the copies that libraries themselves buy , you could argue that , in the long run , libraries augment overall book sales along at least a few channels :
1. Libraries help train young people to be readers ; when those readers are older , they buy books .
2. Libraries expose readers to works by authors they would n’t have otherwise read ; readers may then buy other works by the same author , or even the same book to have in their collection .
3. Libraries help foster a general culture of reading ; without it , there would be less discussion , criticism , and coverage of books in general , which would result in fewer book sales .
But here ’s the point I ’m ( finally ) getting to : if there was no such thing today as the public library and someone like Bill Gates proposed to establish them in cities and towns across the U.S. ( much like Andrew Carnegie once did ) , what would happen ?
I am guessing there would be a huge pushback from book publishers .
Given the current state of debate about intellectual property , can you imagine modern publishers being willing to sell one copy of a book and then have the owner let an unlimited number of strangers borrow it ?
I do n’t think so .
Perhaps they ’d come up with a licensing agreement : the book costs $ 20 to own , with an additional $ 2 per year for every year beyond Year 1 it ’s in circulation .
I ’m sure there would be a lot of other potential arrangements .
And I am just as sure that , like a lot of systems that evolve over time , the library system is one that , if it were being built from scratch today , would have a very different set of dynamics and economics .
No , I ’m not talking about a UFC cage match , comparison people .
I found this post from a small , but extremely well written , blog from Arkansas focused on local city government issues from Springdale , Arkansas–springdalevotes.com .
I gather from the article there is a bit of a tempest in a tea cup over blogging and journalism .
This debate never seems to go away and really this is one of the best comparisons I ’ve read in a long time :
Journalists are professionals at gathering facts and providing reliable , accurate reporting of important information .
They have many professional obligations with respect to their accuracy .
The articles they write are not influenced by their personal opinions ( unless it is an editorial ) .
When you need PDF editor online , visit sodapdf for more details .
We have many fine journalists writing for our local papers , but they are not bloggers , and I doubt they would want to be referred to as such .
The author of the Democrat Gazette Article seems to blur the lines between a newspaperâ€™s web site and a blog .
These lines should not be blurred .
The two mediums serve very different purposes .
Newspapers have far too many professional and legal obligations to be able to create a truly successful blog ( possible exception being the â€œopinionâ€ columnists â€ ” but even that is a stretch .
Most seem unable to break the â€œweeklyâ€ writing mold ) .
Newspaper sites are structured to provide certainty and reliability , often forcing them to move too slowly to create effective blogs .
Yet , this is a good thing .
No one wants their newspaper to be blogging .
It would be irresponsible â€ ” we rely on them for their accuracy .
Blogging is a medium for opinion , debate , and discussion .
It features well - reasoned arguments for a specific point of view and lets visitors comment with or against the author .
Bloggers move quickly and post information , even if its not fully verified , for the sake of discussion .
Responsible bloggers keep checking what theyâ€™ve posted and correct it when they make mistakes .
People should rely on blogs for opinion and discussion , and should realize that they donâ€™t have the same standard of accuracy that a newspaper has .
The mediums serve two very different purposes .
At the moment , many analysts agree , it is an especially ripe time to launch an economic populist campaign .
Andrew Kohut of the Pew Research Center said his surveys showed the highest level of concern over income inequality since the late 1980s , when he started examining the issue .
Stagnant wages for much of middle America , big gains for the very rich and growing strains from rising gas prices and the like all set the stage for the debate , Mr. Kohut says .
“ This is an issue that ’s going to get a hearing in this campaign , ” he says .
“ It will resonate . ”
But those who claim to stand with the people inevitably face a counterattack , which some Democrats are also rediscovering .
Even as former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina began his tour this week to highlight American poverty , the Republican National Committee was weighing in with a series of questions and attacks .
It essentially boiled down to this :
Can a multi-millionaire former trial lawyer with a high - flying lifestyle really understand or care about poverty or middle class America ?
Can he both profit under the current system through hedge funds and the like and vow to change it ?
Some liberal bloggers fumed that this critique presumed that it would somehow be better — more authentic — for a rich man to stand up for his own class interests than to speak up for working America .
They were especially irritated at the news media ’s coverage of the issue .
Alluding to Mr. Edward ’s tour of poor communities , and his emphasis on the issue overall , Paul Waldman wrote on The American Prospect 's TAPPED that this could tell voters “ something about who Edwards is : that he cares about people who are suffering , that he has n’t forgotten the modest circumstances from which he came and that he has the courage to tackle big , seemingly intractable problems . ”

Here 's Bush " responding " to a question about whether he whether he ordered Card and Gonzales to Ashcroft 's hospital bedside .
Is the program classified ?
And which program would that be ?
Is who ordered Card and Gonzales to the hospital classified ?
Was it Dick Cheney in the Blue Room with the shotgun ?
When asked if 9/11 changed the American foreign policy model to " interventionalism , " Rep .
Ron Paul answered that it was our pre-9/11 interventionalism -- and the " blowback " that ensued -- that was to blame for terrorism and the 9/11 attacks .
This prompted Rudy Giuliani , who maintains like George Bush that they " hate us for our freedoms , " to jump in and demand Paul retract his " absurd " statement .

This is a fundamental question that Republicans -- George W. Bush and Rudy Giuliani especially -- simply do n't understand .
They do n't " hate us for our freedoms . "
Not that it any way excuses Bin Laden from leading these horrible attacks on the U.S , but it 's simplistic and dishonest to state that it 's solely an irrational hatred of our society .
Here 's what Michael Scheuer , the former station chief of the CIA 's Osama Bin Laden task force , has to say :
Osama Does n't Hate Our Freedom :
The fundamental flaw in our thinking about Bin Laden is that " Muslims hate and attack us for what we are and think , rather than what we do . "
Muslims are bothered by our modernity , democracy , and sexuality , but they are rarely spurred to action unless American forces encroach on their lands .
It 's American foreign policy that enrages Osama and al - Qaida , not American culture and society .
How is the United States threatening Muslim lands ?
The post -9/11 crackdowns on Muslim charities have effectively ended tithing , which is one of the five pillars of Islam ; our casual denunciations of " jihad " sneer at a central tenet of the Muslim faith .
America supports corrupt anti-Muslim governments in Uzbekistan and China , " apostate " governments in the Middle East , and the new Christian state of East Timor .
And , above all , it continues to house occupying forces in Iraq and Afghanistan .
It 's simple - minded people like Dinesh D'Souza who argue that it's our culture and " freedom " that are to blame for Islamic terrorism ; intellectuals and people who actually know the history of the Middle East and appreciate the ramifications our foreign policy has , like reknowned historian Chalmers Johnson and Michael Scheuer to name a few , who understand the multi- faceted root causes .
As a matter of fact , in videotaped messages before and after 9/11 , bin Laden explained his beef with the United States .
Claim : Photographs show wild bears posing with humans on the grounds around an Alaska cottage .
Status : True .
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , June , 2007 ]
Comment : I found a feature on this guy in one of the Anchorage Newspapers .
He is retired and has been FEEDING bears in his cottage ’s back yard for over 25 years .
The bears just come and hang out and he believes them to be his friends .

WOW , good luck with that ……..
Origins :
The bespectacled , bearded fellow shown in the second row of photographs above is “ bear man ” Charlie Vandergaw , a 68 - year - old former science teacher who resides on a homestead in the Yentna River Valley , fifty miles northwest of Anchorage , Alaska .
As the Anchorage Daily News reported of him :
What goes on each summer at Vandergaw ’s remote homestead is so far from the ordinary as to be almost unbelievable .
Visitors tell of him petting black and brown bears , playing with grizzly cubs while sows stand by , sitting on bears and teaching them tricks .
His own photographs show even more .
They capture him easing to within feet of breeding grizzlies and nursing an injured brown bear .
What goes on each summer at Vandergaw ’s remote homestead is so far from the ordinary as to be almost unbelievable .
Visitors tell of him petting black and brown bears , playing with grizzly cubs while sows stand by , sitting on bears and teaching them tricks .
His own photographs show even more .
They capture him easing to within feet of breeding grizzlies and nursing an injured brown bear .
A visiting photographer is amazed to see head - and - shoulder shots of breeding grizzlies taken with a wide - angle lens — photos that would require the photographer to be within feet , if not inches , of the bears .
There are photos of Vandergaw playing with grizzly cubs while their mother lounges nearby .
There are pictures of gangs of bears around his cabin , of individual bears in his cabin , and even close - ups of a grizzly ’s injured mouth .
It might all seem unbelievable if not for the fact that his photos are confirmed , in effect , by those taken by other photographers and by the black bear wandering around the yard .
Vandergaw says his relationship with bears dates to his retirement from teaching in 1985 .
Over the years he has fed bears , befriended bears , nursed injured bears back to
health , and allowed bears inside his cabin ; now it is not unusual to find several black and brown bears lounging around his “ Bear Farm ” yard on any given day .
Wildlife officials have been critical of Vandergaw ’s activities , maintaining that he ( and his human visitors ) risk an eventual mauling by the bruins , and that his conditioning the creatures to become used to a human presence and to seek handouts of food puts the bears at risk of being shot as dangerous pests .
( Vandergaw maintains that the bears are not his “ pets ” and that they “ know better than to demand food from people . ” )
In April 2010 , Vandergaw was fined $ 20,000 for violating Alaska state law by feeding wild bears .
In addition to the hefty fine , his sentence included three years probation , but no jail time .

Lower California as a Negro Home
A unique and somewhat startling proposition was broached this week by Senator Teller , at Washington startling insomuch as it shows what class of schemes it is considered perfectly proper for our Congressional representatives to father and endorse .
This scheme contemplates the appropriation of the modest sum of $ 50,000,000 for the purpose of enabling a negro colony to emigrate to and settle in Lower California , said sum to be bonded for a period of forty years at a low rate of interest , by which time the promoters of the scheme presume the colony will be able to refund the debt .
The matter began with a petition to Congress complaining of the injustice to which our negro population is subject under existing social conditions and laws , and asserting that the only way out of the difficulty is to give the negro population an opportunity to form an independent and self - supporting colony for itself , where its members may be at liberty to acquire wealth and work out their own social and political salvation in their own way .
The scheme is so visionary and Utopian in character that it leads one to doubt either the sanity of its projectors or the accuracy of the report as to the conditions under which it is proposed to found the colony in question .
In the first place Lower California cannot be appropriated and colonized in the off - hand and wholesome way which the originators of the scheme evidently have a childlike confidence in their ability to perform .
The Mexican Government has something to say on the matter , and might possibly object to an Ethiopian influx of the dimensions which such a movement might assume .
In the second place it is a very grave and still a most doubtful question whether the arid , barren and sparsely settled peninsula stretching from San Diego to Cape San Lucas , could support , much less provide comfortable homes and the increased wealth aimed at , for a great colony such as an expenditure of $ 50,000,000 would necessarily imply .
Scheme upon scheme has been originated during the past twenty years for the appropriation and colonization of Lower California by adventurer after adventurer .
Gold mines , pearl fisheries , cattle ranches , and what not have been sprung upon the unwary all over that delectable region .
Everyone remembers the outcome of the Magdalena Bay excitement .
The Topolobampo farce , though enacted on the Mexican mainland at the other side of the gulf of California , was played upon in most respects similar to that of the peninsula .
Cynical persons might hint that there is a nigger in the fence no pun intended in the present proposition , and that someone interested in working off lands in the barren peninsula , has got to the ear of the confiding Washington negro preachers and others who are moving in the matter , and by specious representations has induced them to believe that Lower California is a land flowing with milk and honey , in short the Promised Land for the oppressed Ethiopian race .
Once let such an idea become imbued in the negro mind , its volatile and enthusiastic character is such , as has been repeatedly shown in similar movement of the past , that the exodus would not stop till most of the five millions of the race upon the continent took part in it .
What untold misery might result from such a movement as the wholesale deportation of a race not yet proved capable of self - government to an inhospitable region , the soil of which has not yet been shown to be capable of supporting its inhabitants by agricultural pursuits , it is not necessary to contemplate .
There never will be a Congress of the United States silly enough to entertain such a proposition as that of Senator Teller .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) -
It is a dark time for record labels and mainstream radio , but the people who pick music for video games say there has never been a better time to be an aspiring rock star .
“ There are more opportunities than ever before .
I would much rather be a young band right now than 10 years ago , ” said Steve Schnur , referring to a time when record companies and radio station owners held the keys to what got heard .
The worldwide executive of music at Electronic Arts Inc. , which is the biggest video game publisher , put a once unknown Southern California band called Avenged Sevenfold in multiple games including EA ’s “ Need for Speed : Most Wanted ” racing game and its perennially popular “ Madden ” football game , which is considered prime real estate .
The band , also known as A7X , has since gotten a Warner Bros Records contract and its songs are now familiar to millions of gamers .
Scottish indie rock band Franz Ferdinand crossed the pond , winning U.S. fans after its music was in games like “ Madden NFL 2005 , ” soccer game “ FIFA 2005 ” and racing title “ Burnout 3 : Takedown , ” said Schnur , who also led the music selection in “ NBA Live 2003 ” -- the only video game soundtrack to go platinum .
“ We ’re a new medium that delivers music in a new and interesting way , ” said Alex Hackford , artist and repertoire manager for Sony Computer Entertainment America .
Hackford has worked with bands in all stages of development , including Stab the Matador , a young band from upstate New York .

He put them in baseball game “ MLB 06 : The Show . ”
From there , he said , the band got a booking agent and a national tour .
“ You have almost a completely level playing field , ” said Hackford .
These days , artists market themselves on the Internet from their bedrooms or depend on a Madison Avenue marketing firm to get the word out .
“ If you ’re entrepreneurial , you can do it yourself , ” Hackford said .
“ It ’s easy to give over control of your career to a multinational corporation and blame somebody when it does n’t go right .
Really driven people are n’t going to cede control , ” he said .
Music - based games such as Konami ’s various karaoke titles , Activision Inc. ’s “ Guitar Hero ” and Sony ’s “ SingStar ” are also an outlet for established groups from the Rolling Stones and Queen to Lynyrd Skynyrd and Deep Purple .
Crooner Frank Sinatra , country star Johnny Cash and the Doors were headliners in Activision ’s “ Tony Hawk Underground 2 . ”
“ It really underscores the fact that there is no longer a magic bullet that sells a record , ” said Celia Hirschman , founder of Downtown Marketing , a music marketing consulting company in San Francisco .
Video games are a perfect way for consumers to discover new music and for bands , especially those of the post - modern punk , hip hop , funk and heavy metal variety , to reach their typically rabid fan base , she said .
“ The music fit with the lifestyle of what they were selling in the game .
It was a no - brainer , ” Hirschman said .
Nick Beard , bassist for Circa Survive , said having the band ’s music appear in a video game would be like fulfilling a childhood dream .
“ I ’ve been playing video games since I was 5 .
It would just be sweet , ” Beard said .

As someone who is trying to sell a new PhD on the market as opposed to someone who has tenure and is trying to sell a PhD - granting program to the government , I can state that the 50 % number seems much closer to reality than the 3 % number .
But that 's without using a Markov model .
Here 's an analysis I did several years ago using the numbers from the Taulbee survey : Q : Are you better off investing your dollars in a PhD or the Lotto ?
A : It depends .
Here are the details Cost of getting a PhD : $ 150,000 - $ 250,000 in tuition and barebones living expenses .
Most of us in the sciences have this paid by the government .
Many of us have " lost " income by going to graduate school because we gave up jobs that paid substantially more than the stipend .
In my case I 've " lost " about $ 150,000 to $ 250,000 in the deal .
The raw odds : How many PhDs a year in Comp. Sci. ( for example ) : 850-1000 How many Professorships in Universities : 35 - 70 How many Professorships in Colleges : 70 -100 ( estimate )
Chance of ending up in a Professorship after you do a few PostDocs : 1 in 10 to 1 in 5 Odds of winning the Virginia Lotto is about one chance in 7 million .
" Investing " $ 250,000 in the Lotto gives you 1 chance in 28 of winning .
" Investing " $ 500,000 in the Lotto gives you 1 chance in 14 of winning .
So the odds of just " getting " a Professorship are still somewhat better .
But what about the Payoff ?
Lotto : 20 year annuity where the winning amount ( usually between 3 and 10 million dollars ) is paid out annually .
That comes out to between $ 150,000 a year and $ 500,000 a year . )
Professorship : $ 40,000 to $ 80,000 ( when you get tenure at a top - flight university )
When you normalize for this , the substantially higher payoff of the Lotto starts equalizing things .
What about the Work Load ?
Lotto : Posing for pictures for the Lotto advertisement agency .
Answering questions of newspaper reporters .
Fending off relatives who want a slice of the action .
Talking to Robin Leach .
Professorship : Posing for pictures for the Alumni news agency .
Answering questions of undergraduates .
Fending off relatives who want help setting up their home computer systems .
Things are starting to tilt toward the Lotto , huh ?
If you can handle Robin Leach .
What about the downside ?
PhD : Well you can still find employment in many different places .
They may not care about your dissertation or give you the chance to do research , but you can usually fool people into thinking that the PhD makes you smart .
Is this job any better than the one you could have gotten with your BS degree ?
Who knows ...
Lotto :
You 're broke and out of luck .
Your only chance is getting your gambling declared a " disease " that should be covered by public health care .
This would probably generate a bigger monthly check than your stipend .
The PhD is definitely a win here .
What about the cost in time ?
Lotto :
One week of gritting your teeth .
Cost : negligible .
You can still watch " Studs " or the " Love Connection " during this time .
PhD : 3 - 7 years of your life .
No TV .
No friends .
Old people like to say things like , " Enjoy your youth .
It 's the best time of your life . "
Yeah , but what about the knowledge ?
Lotto : PhD in the school of life .
Dissertation topic : " A fool and his money are soon parted . "
PhD : Lots of great knowledge .
Really .
You can't discount this if you 're a nerd .
If you 're even considering graduate school then you probably place plenty of abstract value and pride in understanding and applying the calculus of variations .
What is the lesson in all of this ?
The odds are pretty close .
The PhD gives you a much better downside if you 're risk adverse , but the upside of winning the Lotto is substantially better .
Note that my numbers were taken from Computer Science -- one of the " hot " fields .
If you 're one of the people that feels that government money is just " funny " money that would have just gone for bombs , then the odds get a bit harder to compute .
The whole deal is just a low paying job and you 're only sacrificing lost income .
If you do n't have a job anyways , then graduate school is a pure win that does n't really cost you anything .
It 's sort of like welfare for clean - cut , middle - class kids .
What if you 're a scientist -- the type who does everything rationally by the numbers ?
This leads to a really deep paradox .
The whole job of doing science is monetarily equivalent to " investing " in a gambling scheme where the odds are heavily stacked against you .
Most scientists disdain gambling because they know the math .
Why do they even bother doing science ?
Because they " love " learning .
But everyone at Gamblers Anonymous " loves " the Lotto .

eBay has begun providing open - source code for some of its search and access applications to expand its external developer community .
The software will be available under a new program called Community Codebase , which was announced at the eBay Developers Conference in San Jose , California , on Tuesday .
With just over 20 per cent of the listed items on eBay coming in through applications and tools provided by external developers , the auction giant is hoping to encourage developers to find new ways of using the online marketplace .
" We ’ve seen lots of great examples of open - source applications , clearly ; Linux , Apache and Firefox just to name a few .
We wanted to really tap that mindshare and that creativity on a global basis .
And so , having a really big push with open source is the way to do that , ” said Greg Isaacs , director of eBay ’s developer program .
The Community Codebase is free for all members of eBay ’s Developers Program and PayPal Developer Network .
( Pay Pal is owned by eBay . )
It allows individual developers and companies to access source code for various eBay and PayPal tools and applications .
An example is a Java application that allows TiVo users to search and bid on items via their digital video recorder boxes .
Other examples include a Firefox toolbar , various Pay Pal toolkits and an application used to extract information from Pay Pal ’s database and putting it into Microsoft Corp .'s Excel spreadsheet software .
e Bay created its first program for developers in 2000 and has 15,000 registered members today .
Managing the community is done partly with software from CollabNet that gives the developers and eBay tools for revision control , issue tracking and discussion forums .
Even though Isaacs stressed that the open source approach was an " easy decision to make , ” courting the open - source community can sometimes prove difficult .
" It ’s not like open source is bad or good .
It depends on what you 're trying to accomplish .
They [ eBay ] do n’t make their money off of their source code , they make their money out of the whole package , ” said Larry McVoy , chief executive officer of South San Francisco - based BitMover , which has been involved in the Linux kernel development .
Revenue generator
BitMover , however , does make money off its source code , and McVoy plans to change his company 's open - source approach next month because of a licensing dispute with Samba developer Andrew Tridgell .
After years of allowing open - source developers to use his BitKeeper source code management system free of charge , BitMover will next month begin charging them for the right to use its software .
Still , McVoy thinks eBay 's move makes sense because it has an alternative form of generating revenue .
" There ’s probably significant advantage for eBay in terms of opening it [ the eBay applications source code ] up , getting more people using it , more people working with eBay .
Anything that draws more eyeballs to eBay is good for eBay . ”
With the Community Codebase program , eBay also follows in the footsteps of competitors such as Amazon and Google by giving away access to the content in its database .
Individual members will now have access to 10,000 database calls per month .
For companies , accessing the database ranges from a flat fee of US $ 100 up to whatever is negotiated .
In the first quarter of 2005 , eBay supported approximately 1.7 billion monthly requests through external applications , which made up 42 per cent of all calls to the eBay database .
WASHINGTON — Bank of Canada Governor David Dodge says North America could one day embrace a euro - style single currency .
But to get there , Canada , the United States and Mexico must first tear down barriers to the free flow of labour , which he pointed out Monday have “ gotten a bit thicker ” in recent years .
Answering questions from the audience after a speech in Chicago , Mr. Dodge said a single currency was “ possible . ”
The idea of a common currency has long been a subject of curiosity , particularly among Canadian academics , who see it as a way to escape sharp gyrations in the exchange rate .
The recent surge in the Canadian dollar to a 30 - year high against the U.S. currency makes Canadian products a lot less competitive in Canada 's major foreign market .
The high loonie also makes Canada a more expensive tourist destination .
Some proponents have dubbed the single North American currency the “ amero . ”
It is more likely , however , that a common currency would mean that Canada and Mexico would adopt the U.S. dollar , giving up significant economic control to a central bank dominated by the United States .
Also Monday , Mr. Dodge told reporters that much of the Canadian dollar 's recent increase is the result of a strong economy .
But he said the bank is closely watching the impact of the dollar 's gain on Canadian inflation , adding that prices had been coming in “ a little bit stronger ” than expected over recent months .
“ We will have to monitor that very closely , ” Mr. Dodge said .
In the past two months alone , the Canadian dollar is up about 8 per cent against the U.S. dollar , and is now worth more than 91 cents ( U.S. ) .
He declined to comment on “ day - to - day and week - to - week ” movements in the currency .
The dollar is also rising as speculators bet that that the price of oil and other key commodities , which Canada has in abundance , will continue to rise .
Mr. Dodge also said the U.S. housing slump is taking its toll on the Canadian economy .
Canada supplies about a third of the nearly $ 10 - billion a year worth of lumber that the United States consumes .
“ We 're probably the only U.S. trading partner who gets really hurt by that , ” he said .
In an earlier speech to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs , Mr. Dodge said the International Monetary Fund should play a far greater role in monitoring rising global imbalances in savings and investment .
He said the IMF needs to be looking at countries ' exchange rates , monetary policies and fiscal balances to make sure they are n't hurting other economies .
“ If these policies are inappropriate , or not coherent , they can damage not only one 's own domestic economy , but they can also have spillover effects abroad , ” he said .
IMF reform has been a common these for Mr. Dodge , who has announced he will retire later this year .
He has said the Washington - based institution must do more surveillance and less lending to stay relevant .
It rocketed across the Internet a week ago , a startling newspaper report that agents from the US Department of Homeland Security had visited a student at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth at his New Bedford home simply because he had tried to borrow Mao Tse - Tung 's '' Little Red Book " for a history seminar on totalitarian goverments .
The story , first reported in last Saturday 's New Bedford Standard - Times , was picked up by other news organizations , prompted diatribes on left - wing and right - wing blogs , and even turned up in an op - ed piece written by Senator Edward M. Kennedy in the Globe .
But yesterday , the student confessed that he had made it up after being confronted by the professor who had repeated the story to a Standard - Times reporter .
The professor , Brian Glyn Williams , said he went to his former student 's house and asked about inconsistencies in his story .
The 22 - year - old student admitted it was a hoax , Williams said .
' ' I made it up , " the professor recalled him saying .
'' I 'm sorry .
. . .
I 'm so relieved that it 's over . "
The student was not identified in any reports .
The Globe interviewed him Thursday but decided not to write a story about his assertion , because of doubts about its veracity .
The student could not be reached yesterday .
Williams said the student gave no explanation .
But Williams , who praised the student as hard - working and likeable , said he was shaken by the deception .
' ' I feel as if I was lied to , and I have no idea why , " said Williams , an associate professor of Islamic history .
He said the possibility the government was scrutinizing books borrowed by his students '' disturbed me tremendously . "
The story stems from an incident in the fall in a history seminar on totalitarianism and fascism taught by a colleague of Williams , Robert Pontbriand .
The student , who was in the seminar , told Pontbriand he had requested an unabridged copy of '' Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse - Tung " through the UMass interlibrary loan system for a research paper .
Days later , he told Pontbriand , he was stunned to get a visit by Homeland Security agents who told him the book was on a ' ' watch list " and asked why he wanted it .
Pontbriand was appalled .
'' A university is a place for the open inquiry for the truth , " he said .
The story quickly made its way around the history department , and it might have stayed on campus if The New York Times had not broken a story about President Bush 's approval of a controversial domestic spying program .
After that story , a Standard - Times reporter called Williams , who has traveled to Afghanistan for research , to ask whether he was concerned about government surveillance , Williams said .
As an afterthought , Williams said , he told the reporter about the alleged visit by the Homeland Security agents , and that became the lead of the Dec. 17 Standard - Times story .
John Hoey , spokesman for UMass - Dartmouth , said the university did not expect to take any action against the student .
'' This was a conversation that took place between a student and his faculty members , " Hoey said .
Dan Rosenfeld , managing editor of the newspaper , declined to comment yesterday , saying that the paper considered it a ' ' competitive newspaper story . "
The university issued a statement Monday defending academic freedom , but said it had had no visits from Homeland Security agents and no record of any student seeking the Mao book through an interlibrary loan .
The student later told the professors he had requested the book at UMass - Amherst .
But officials there said UMass - Dartmouth students cannot use their ID cards at the Amherst library and that all interlibrary requests are made by the libraries , not students .
A Homeland Security spokeswoman in Washington said she had no record of any interview of a UMass - Dartmouth student and pointed out that the department does not have its own agents .
An FBI spokeswoman in Boston also expressed doubt .
That did n't stop it from buzzing around the Internet and even being picked up by Kennedy , who cited it as the latest example of the Bush administration 's intrusion on civil liberties .
'' Incredibly , we are now in an era where reading a controversial book may be evidence of a link to terrorist , " he wrote in an op - ed piece in Thursday 's Globe .
Laura Capps , a Kennedy spokeswoman , said last night that the senator cited '' public reports " in his opinion piece .
Even if the assertion was a hoax , she said , it did not detract from Kennedy 's broader point that the Bush administration has gone too far in engaging in surveillance .

WASHINGTON , May 8 — Zacarias Moussaoui added another bizarre chapter to his own case today when he asked to withdraw his guilty plea to terrorism - related charges , saying he is now convinced he can get a fair trial " even with Americans as jurors . "
Just five days after a jury imposed a life sentence on him for concealing his knowledge of the Sept. 11 attacks , Mr. Moussaoui told Federal Judge Leonie M. Brinkema that he claimed to be a member of the plot " even though I knew that was a complete fabrication . "
Mr. Moussaoui told Judge Brinkema , in what appeared to be a futile motion to withdraw his plea , that he had not trusted the American legal system because he was not assigned a Muslim lawyer , and that his days in solitary confinement had provoked him to fight that system .
The jurors ' decision to spare his life made him look at his situation anew , Mr. Moussaoui said .
He said he would welcome a trial where he could show he was not part of the 9/11 plot " because I now see that it is possible that I can receive a fair trial even with Americans as jurors . "
HOLBROOK , N.Y. , June 5  Victor M. De Leon III has been playing video games on the professional circuit for five years now , racking up thousands of dollars in prizes and endorsements at tournaments around the country .
He has a national corporate sponsor , a publicist and a Web site , with 531 photos chronicling his career .
A documentary filmmaker has been following him for months .
Victor weighs 56 pounds and likes to watch SpongeBob SquarePants at his home here on Long Island .
He celebrated his 9th birthday last month with a trip to a carnival and a vanilla cake .
He gets above - average marks in the third grade , where he recently drew a dragon for art class .
The appropriately named Victor  better known to cyber rivals and fans as Lil’ Poison  is thought to be the world ’s youngest professional gamer ; Guinness has called about listing him in its book of World Records .
Starting on Friday , he is set to be among 2,500 competitors in the three - day Major League Gaming Pro Circuit Event at the Meadowlands in New Jersey , battling for titles like the titan on the Xbox game Halo 2 and prizes up to $ 20,000 .
Asked what he thinks about the fuss over his virtual exploits , Victor shrugged with shy indifference .
Pressed , he mumbled : “ I do n’t know .
I did n’t think about it . ”
WASHINGTON , D.C. , July 30 , 2007 - As Congress reviews federal efforts to boost student performance , new research published in Educational Researcher ( ER ) reports that progress in raising test scores was stronger before No Child Left Behind was approved in 2002 , compared with the four years following enactment of the law .
The article " Gauging Growth : How to Judge No Child Left Behind " " is authored by Bruce Fuller , Joseph Wright , Kathryn Gesicki , and Erin Kang , and is one of four featured works published in the current issue of ER - - a peer - reviewed scholarly journal of the American Educational Research Association .
Bruce Fuller , lead author and professor of education and public policy at the University of California , Berkeley , noted that the strong advances in narrowing racial and income - based achievement gaps seen in the 1990s have faded since passage of ' No Child ' .
" The slowing of achievement gains , even declines in reading , since 2002 suggests that state - led accountability efforts -- well underway by the mid-1990s -- packed more of a punch in raising student performance , compared with the flattening - out of scores during the ' No Child ' era , " he observed .
" We are not suggesting that ' No Child ' has dampened the earlier progress made by the states , " Fuller said .
" But we find no consistent evidence that federal reforms have rekindled the states ' earlier gains .
Federal activism may have helped to sustain the buoyancy in children 's math scores at the fourth - grade level , seen throughout the prior decade . "
The researchers pushed beyond earlier studies by tracking progress in both state and federal test scores in 12 diverse states , going back to 1992 in many cases .
This approach captured the generally positive effects of maturing state - led accountability programs in both reading and math , gauged by state officials and the National Assessment of Educational Progress ( NAEP ) .
Using this longer time span as the baseline , annual changes in student performance generally slowed after 2002 , as gauged by state and federal testing agencies , and the earlier narrowing of achievement gaps ground to a halt ( NAEP results ) , according to the study .
The university team focused on 12 states , including Arkansas , California , Illinois , Iowa , Kentucky , Massachusetts , Nebraska , New Jersey , North Carolina , Oklahoma , Texas , and Washington .
They selected these states because they are demographically diverse , geographically dispersed , and were able to provide comparable test score data over time .
Following passage of the ' No Child ' law , federal reading scores among elementary school students declined in the 12 states tracked by the researchers - after climbing steadily during the 1990s .
The share of fourth - graders proficient in reading , based on federal NAEP results , climbed by one - half a percentage point each year , on average , between the mid-1990s and 2002 .
But over the four years after the legislation was passed , the share of students deemed proficient declined by about one percent .
The annual rise in the percentage of fourth - graders proficient in mathematics improved slightly in the same 12 states , moving up from 1.6 percent per year before ' No Child ' was signed to a yearly growth rate of 2.5 percent following enactment of the law .
This is the one out of six federal gauges where a post - NCLB gain was observed by the research team , tracking NAEP results .
The researchers simultaneously tracked achievement trends gauged by state and federal testing agencies over the 14 - year period .
" The correlation between the two barometers was close to zero , " Fuller said .
" We worry about the capacity of states to report unbiased test score results over time .
But even state results generally confirm the more reliable NAEP pattern showing that progress in raising achievement has largely faded since 2002 . "
The authors urged Congress to improve the capacity of states to reliably track the performance of their students over time .
" The fundamental principles of transparency and simplicity might guide state and congressional leaders , " Fuller said .
" The hurdles defining basic and proficient student performance between federal and state assessments should become more consistent . "
Fuller added that " state and NAEP officials could do more to inform the public on how student demographics are changing , and achievement trends should be interpreted in this context . "

The escalating violence raking Baghdad and other Iraqi cities is pushing that nation ’s leaders , neighboring Arab countries and U.S. advisers to consider a dramatic change of direction in the conduct of the war .
Leaks from a U.S. task force headed by former Secretary of State James A. Baker III are contributing to the widespread sense that the Bush administration is preparing for a “ course correction ” in the coming months .
The options cited most frequently in Washington include the partition of Iraq into three ethnic - or faith - based regions , and a phased withdrawal of U.S. troops , with some remaining in neighboring countries to deal with major threats .
Another scenario is being discussed — and taken seriously in Iraq — by many of Iraq ’s leading political players , under which the U.S. - trained army would overthrow struggling Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki and replace him with a strongman who would restore order while Washington looks the other way .
Falah Hassan al - Naqib , a Sunni politician who served as minister of the interior in the interim government led by Iyad Allawi until last year , told The Washington Times he has met repeatedly with American and Iraqi generals to discuss alternative courses of action .
“ All of them have a ‘ Plan B , ’ because if the situation continues as it is , they will have to defend themselves — not just find bodies all over , ” Mr. al - Naqib said this summer at his house in Baghdad .
Mayhem has continued in Baghdad despite a U.S. decision to redeploy some 8,000 U.S. troops into the capital over the summer .
Officials yesterday reported the deaths of 10 American troops across the country , putting October on track to be the deadliest month in almost two years .
On Monday , The Washington Times reported that Gen. George Casey , the top U.S. commander in Iraq , was “ more sober ” and “ more concerned ” about the ability of the Iraqi security forces when he privately briefed senior military and civilian leaders in Washington last week .
Defense sources said he had appeared more upbeat over the winter about the Iraqi security force ’s progress .
The sources said , however , Gen . Casey was not pessimistic and still thinks the U.S. will win in Iraq .
Gen .
Casey ’s spokesman said the general thinks the Iraqi security forces have made great progress and are on track to take over more counterinsurgency missions .
Others in the Bush administration have contributed to the sense that the al - Maliki government has been put on a short leash , with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice saying on a trip to the region Oct. 6 that Iraqi leaders “ do n’t have time for endless debates on these issues . …
They have really got to move forward . ”
Days before that , Zalmay Khalilzad , the U.S. ambassador to Iraq , said on CNN that the Iraqi government , “ in the course of the next two months , has to make progress in terms of containing sectarian violence . ”
Similarly , Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John W. Warner , Virginia Republican , told reporters after a trip to Baghdad this month that Congress will have to make “ bold decisions ” if the Iraqi government does not bring the sectarian killings under control .
Even Mr. Baker , whose bipartisan commission is expected to hand its recommendations to the Bush administration after the congressional elections , said on ABC ’s “ This Week ” that “ I happen to think , and I think it ’s fair to say our commission believes , that there are alternatives between the stated alternatives … of stay the course and cut and run . ”
President Bush reassured Mr. al - Maliki in a telephone call on Monday that there was no deadline hanging over his administration , but that has done little to quell the speculation .
The most talked - about scenarios for a “ Plan B ” include :
 Phased withdrawal : Under this plan , U.S. troops would be gradually withdrawn over a period of months and a reserve force would be redeployed elsewhere in the region .
“ Our troops have become the primary target of the insurgency , ” argued Rep. John P. Murtha , Pennsylvania Democrat , who laid out a plan for an immediate withdrawal in November .
“ They are united against U.S. forces and we have become a catalyst for violence . …
I believe with a U.S. troop redeployment , the Iraqi security forces will be incentivized to take control . ”
He proposed the creation of a “ quick reaction force ” and an “ over - the - horizon presence ” of Marines in the region to deal with urgent problems such as signs that al Qaeda was gaining control of an area .
Similar arguments have been made by Richard A. Clarke , who provided national security advice to the last four presidents , and Edward N. Luttwak , a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies .
CBS reporter David Martin recently quoted a source in the Baker commission saying the group may recommend a scheme under which 5 percent of U.S. troops are withdrawn from Iraq every two months .
Opponents of the plan — including most Iraqis — argue that without a strong U.S. troop presence , the country would quickly fall into a vicious civil war and terrorists would be able to establish safe havens from which to harass neighboring U.S. allies .
 Partition : Under this plan , notably advocated by Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. , Delaware Democrat , Iraq would be divided into Sunni , Shi’ite and Kurdish regions , each enjoying a high degree of autonomy .
A viable central government would remain responsible for border defense , foreign policy , oil production and revenues under the scheme worked out by Mr. Biden and Leslie H. Gelb , president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations .
While acknowledging that decentralization would not immediately end the problem of murderous militias affiliated with the various political parties , Mr. Biden argued in a May 1 speech in Philadelphia that this was the best way to begin rolling them back .
“ The regions can become magnets for the militia , integrating them into local forces , and eventually into the national force . ”
This solution would win quick acceptance from the Kurds , who already enjoy a high degree of autonomy in their oil - rich northern region and have little interest in what happens in Baghdad .
Many Shi’ites — who control the southern oil fields — would also welcome the arrangement , and this month pushed through a new law opening the door to the establishment of an autonomous region in the south .
The Sunnis , stuck in the middle of the country with no oil and few other resources , could be brought along with a constitutional amendment guaranteeing them 20 percent of all present and future oil revenues , argued Mr. Biden , the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
“ That ’s … far more than they ’d get otherwise , since the oil is in the north and south , not the Sunni center . ”
Mr. Baker , however , has already expressed skepticism about the idea , noting that there is no easy way to divide up Baghdad and other major population centers like Kirkuk , where ethnic and religious groupings are closely intermingled .
There are also fears that an autonomous Shi’ite region would quickly fall into the orbit of Iran , while the Sunni region would be ungovernable , offering a safe haven for al Qaeda and related terrorist groups to mount attacks on U.S. allies like Saudi Arabia and Jordan .
 Coup in Baghdad :
While given little credence in Washington , this scenario is being widely talked about in Iraq and in neighboring countries , both on the streets and among senior political and military officials .
According to the scenario , the new U.S. - trained army , along with elements of Saddam Hussein ’s Ba’athist - led army , would stage a coup to oust the al - Maliki government and replace it with one led by a more effective figure — by most accounts Mr. Allawi .
One Iraqi Sunni living in Dubai , who is in close contact with Sunni generals in exile in both the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia , said those generals have been discussing such a “ Plan B ” with secular Shi’ites and U.S. officials for months .
These officers reportedly are convinced that Miss Rice has been discussing such ideas during a series of visits to Saudi Arabia over the past eight months .
Mr. Allawi , a secular Shi’ite who led the government before the 2005 legislative elections , is known as a strong man with backing from both secular Shi’ites and Sunnis tired of the sectarian killings .
The politician also is liked by U.S. intelligence agencies , which were disappointed that his party was unable to win more seats in the parliamentary elections .
“ The army scenario is not a bad scenario for the United States , ” said Robert Killebrew , a retired Army infantry colonel and national security analyst who predicted civil war in Iraq more than a year ago .
“ U.S. policy issues in the Middle East and Iraq do not require a democratic Iraq , it only requires a stable and friendly Iraq , ” he said .
Under this scenario , the Dubai - based Sunni source said , the army would gradually bring back elements of Saddam ’s former army , removing a major grievance that is driving the insurgency .
“ The insurgency will come under control as most of them are concerned with keeping Iraq as one country .
This is the most important for them and for the surrounding Arab countries , ” said the former officer .
According to most coup talk , the United States would publicly condemn the move but support the new government after a decent interval .
“ My preference would be that there would be a certain amount of sanctimonious hand - wringing and saying that we do n’t agree with the overthrow of a democratically elected government , ” said Mr. Killebrew .
“ But we will continue to support the Iraqis in their fight against the insurgency , which would be de facto support . ”

They say the Chelsea Flower Show has been particularly innovative this year .
Designer roof gardens , Norwegian science parks , even an astronaut 's allotment - they 've all won prizes and plaudits .
You may even have been busy this Bank Holiday , braving the wind and rain , to give your own garden a modernist makeover .
Scroll down for more
But it 's a fair bet that even the most cutting - edge gardener would find it hard to include the outrageous specimen I 'm seeking .
Because right now I 'm striding across the dunes of Namibia 's Skeleton Coast , surrounded by mile after mile of barren wasteland , on the hunt for the word 's ugliest plant .
And I 'm hoping I 'm not too late , because welwitschia is fast disappearing from the great Namib Desert of southern Africa .
If you 've never heard of welwitschia , you 're probably not alone .
Despite its unrivalled status as the most hideous speciclungmen in the plant kingdom , it gets relatively little attention from conservationists .
The reason is obvious .
When it comes to highlighting the plight of species facing extinction , it tends to be the more glamorous or endearing of the world 's threatened natural wonders that enjoy all the fuss .
The giant panda , the Siberian tiger , mountain gorillas : these are the celebs of the ecological cause .
But what happens when an ugly and hard - to - love plant is under similar threat ?
The silence is deafening .
Which is a shame , because while welwitschia is certainly the most godawful mess to look at , it is nonetheless a truly remarkable species .
For a start , and uniquely in the plant kingdom , it produces just two leaves - but each one can be up to 80 yards long .
These enormous green fronds coil out and around each other like diseased dragons ' tongues , to resemble a mass of cactus - like projections , ending in a sunbleached grey frizzle .
The whole plant can be 20ft wide and 6ft tall , with roots going down another 6ft .
Some people think welwitschia is actually a semi- submerged tree : a conifer that buries itself in the sand , perhaps to escape the catcalls of derision at its horrendous looks .
But welwitschia is n't merely grotesque .
It is also poisonous to most animals , except for the black rhino .
Its toxic labyrinth of leaves boasts just one real inhabitant , the pyrrhocorrid bug .
This beetle is vernacularly known as the Pushmepullyou - because its ceaseless back - to - back copulation makes it look like a miniature version of the two - headed fictional beast from the Dr Dolittle books .
But perhaps most astonishingly of all is the welwitschia 's longevity .
It can live for more than 2,000 years , making it one of the most pensionable organisms on Earth .
That means there are welwitschias around today that were first showing their ugly little tendrils when Jesus was a boy .
Welwitschia 's scientific " history " is almost as intriguing .
The plant was discovered by the Austrian physician , and failed theatre critic , Friedrich Welwitsch , who was trekking across the Namib Desert in 1859 .
So overcome was the good Doktor by his find that he knelt down next to the hideous plant and simply gawped for hours .
Once he had recovered from this shocking encounter , Welwitsch sent a sample of his discovery to Sir Joseph Hooker , Regius Director of Kew Gardens .
Hooker immediately said of the organism : " It is without question the most wonderful plant ever brought to this country , and one of the ugliest . "
When he had finished insulting the new species , Hooker decided to give the plant its official Latin name : welwitschia mirabilis .
The first part was obviously in honour of Dr Welwitsch , the second part - mirabilis - was a tribute to the plant 's miraculous and unique qualities .
But naming this wallflower of wallflowers was just the beginning .
It also had to be classified .
Because it was so different from other gymnosperms - a species of related plant - welwitschia was placed in its own family , like an unwanted orphan .
It does share a kinship with two other plant families , but the connections between them are remote .
These days , welwitschia is thought to be a living fossil , a relic from the Jurassic era , when gymnosperms dominated the Earth .
Apparently , most of these plants died out or evolved , but welwitschia on to its way of life , like an aged aunt pickled in gin .
Experts believe that the plant endured because of its harsh desert setting .
In an arid landscape , which has grown even more hostile over the millennia , less determined plants simply gave up or moved on .
By contrast , leathery old welwitschia has refused to admit defeat .
But how does it survive in this severe environment ?
Again , it is only thanks to another natural wonder .
The Skeleton Coast is the seaward strip of the Namib Desert - one of the oldest and driest deserts in the world .
Whole years can pass without a single shower .
And when it gets warm , it gets really warm : ground temperatures of an egg - frying 65 centigrade are not unknown - making life impossible , you might think , even for the most cussed lump of green frizzle .
So how does welwitschia survive ?
The answer lies in the fogs that constantly envelop the region .
Although the Namib Desert is exceptionally hot and dry , the coast here is cold , because of the Benguela sea current , which brings frigid water from the Antarctic .
This collision of desert heat and oceanic chill produces vast , soggy mists .
This is the water that nourishes welwitschia .
Those hideous leaves , those leprous stamens , those snaking and sinister taproots , might seem repellent to us , but they all serve the purpose of sucking moisture out of the foggy air .
Welwitschia is nothing if not practical .
Indeed , the plant is just one of a number of peculiar - species that live in this extreme neighbourhood , which is the very reason that I have been drawn here .
As an author and travel writer , I have long been fascinated by the more outlandish places on the planet .
Over the past few years , I have searched for the real Garden of Eden in Turkey , I have eaten fried tarantulas in Cambodia , and I 've tracked the descendants of the real Lady Dracula in Transylvania .
Now I 've come to Namibia on a pilgrimage to see , first hand , the strange and wonderful species it is home to .
As I walk across the wilderness , I 'm also looking out for a beetle which stands on its head ( so the dew can condense on its thorax ) and a kind of lion that can navigate through fog .
There 's also a species of flower that looks like a pebble , a lichen that can change colour in seconds , elephants that like to bodysurf down sand dunes , and a giant spider , the White Lady of the Namib , that does a strange jittery dance and lives off geckoes .
But most of all , if I 'm honest , I want to see welwitschia .
Can this freaky tree really be as ugly as they say ?
Kneeling on the sunburnt rocks , I scan the hot , misty horizon .
Nothing doing .
It looks like I may be out of luck .
Changing climate and human pressure are diminishing the unique habitat where welwitschias thrive .
Some think the plant might disappear in a few decades .
But I 'm in luck .
As I round a rocky outcrop , I find what I have come for .
And wow - they 're right - it really sucks .
Up close , welwitschia looks like the wretched offspring of a Triffid and a collapsed Irish rugby scrum .
Sprawled messily across the sand , it has an air of bashful sadness .
The funny thing is , the more I stare at the mess of sunscorched leaves in front of me , the more I like it .
Against all the odds , in one of the most inhospitable place on Earth , it has survived and adapted .
And perhaps above all , it is a triumphant counterblast against a world that prizes beauty above all things .
DENVER , March 3 —
As migrant laborers flee Colorado because of tough new immigration restrictions , worried farmers are looking to prisoners to fill their places in the fields .
In a pilot program run by the state Corrections Department , supervised teams of low - risk inmates beginning this month will be available to harvest the swaths of sweet corn , peppers and melons that sweep the southeastern portion of the state .
Under the program , which has drawn criticism from groups concerned about immigrants ’ rights and from others seeking changes in the criminal justice system , farmers will pay a fee to the state , and the inmates , who volunteer for the work , will be paid about 60 cents a day , corrections officials said .
Concerned about the possible shortage of field labor , Dorothy B. Butcher , a state representative from Pueblo and a supporter of the program , said , “ The workers on these farms do the weeding , the harvesting , the storing , everything that comes with growing crops for the market . ”

Facebook WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The Consumer Product Safety Commission could soon shrink to the point where it can't effectively protect the public , veteran Commissioner Thomas Moore says .
Many employees at the agency responsible for overseeing the safety of many thousands of consumer products are looking for other jobs because " they have no confidence the agency will continue to exist — or will exist in any meaningful form , " Moore said in a statement Thursday .
" The commission can either continue to decline in staff , resources and stature to the point where it is no longer an effective force in consumer protection , " said Moore , " or with the support of Congress it can regain the important place in American society it was originally designed to have . "
The number of full - time staffers has shrunk to about 400 , less than half the size of the staff in 1980 .
Complaints from business leadership about the agency created in the early 1970s resulted in the staff being sharply cut during the Reagan administration , and staff size has continued to shrink .
The Consumer Product Safety
Act was amended to prohibit mandatory safety standards if a voluntary standard would eliminate or significantly reduce the risk of injury .
The safety commission usually negotiates voluntary recalls of unsafe products because a voluntary agreement is considered a faster way to get a product off the shelves .
If a company refuses to recall a product , the agency 's commission has the authority to order a recall .
But such actions can be lengthy as they work their way through the legal system .
The commission can also assess civil penalties on companies for failure to report possible problems and can set product standards .
Democrats in Congress have introduced legislation to increase funding and staffing for the agency as well as enhance its powers .
Moore , who was appointed to the commission by President Clinton more than 12 years ago , said he was pleased that Acting Commission Chairwoman Nancy Nord , an appointee of President Bush , is also in favor of modernizing the laws relating to the commission .
" This should send a really positive message to the public and to the safety community that this is a commission that can work together , " said commission spokeswoman Julie Vallese .
The agency also has been hampered by a vacancy on its three - member commission .
With only two of three commissioners , the agency had no quorum and has been unable to make rules about product standards , mandate recalls and assess civil penalties for the last six months .
Congress could soon restore those powers to the agency for a limited time despite the commission vacancy .
Bush 's pick to head the safety commission , Michael Baroody , withdrew his nomination in May after strong opposition from some Senate Democrats because of his career as a manufacturers ' lobbyist .

ABC News is reporting that , later this afternoon , all charges that had been brought against members of the Duke University lacrosse team will be dropped :
April 10 , 2007 â € ”
The office of North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper will announce that he is dismissing all charges against three Duke Lacrosse players , ABC News has learned from sources close to the case .
Special prosecutors from the attorney general ’s office took over the case after Durham District Attorney Mike Nifong recused himself in January amid charges of unethical conduct filed against him by the North Carolina Bar .
The holes in this case should have been apparent from the beginning , and yet Prosecutor Michael Nifong ignored them , charged the players with rape and related crimes , and continued to zealously pursue their conviction in the face of clear evidence that the accuser ’s story just did n’t add up :
Defense attorneys have released documents detailing how the accuser changed key details in her story in the weeks and months after the alleged assault .
Legal analysts and forensic experts have criticized what they call a critically flawed photo identification lineup â€ ” a lineup that led to the identification and indictment of Evans , Finnerty , Seligmann .
No DNA evidence was found matching any lacrosse players with samples from the rape kit , while DNA from unidentified men was found on the accuser ’s body and clothing .
Other reports indicated that Nifong did n’t even talk to the accuser until months after the incident and well after reports had come out calling key details of her story into question .
Now , Nifong is under investigation by the North Carolina State Bar and could very well be disbarred and conceivably end up in prison and face civil liability to the players that he wrongfully accused .
The broader lesson of the Duke lacrosse case , though , should not be forgotten .
Prosecutors are different from other attorneys in that the ethical rules that bind them require them to seek the truth even if that results in a dismissal of the case .
In this case , it ’s clear that Nifong forgot that duty and the only good thing is that he was stopped before this went any further .
One wonders how many men and women are sitting in prisons today because their Michael Nifong was n’t caught in time .
Update @ 3:00 pm : And it ’s official , the charges have been dropped :
RALEIGH , N.C. —
Prosecutors dropped all charges Wednesday against the three Duke lacrosse players accused of sexually assaulting a stripper at a party , saying the athletes were innocent victims of a “ tragic rush to accuse ” by an overreaching district attorney .
“ There were many points in the case where caution would have served justice better than bravado , ” North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper said in a blistering assessment of Durham County District Mike Nifong ’s handling of the case .
Cooper , who took over the case after Nifong was charged with ethics violations that could get him disbarred , said his own investigation concluded not only that the evidence against the young men was insufficient , but that no attack took place .
Reade Seligmann , Collin Finnerty and David Evans were indicted last spring on charges of rape , kidnapping and sexual offense after the woman told police she was assaulted at a lacrosse team party where she had been hired to perform as a stripper .
The charges are dropped but , of course , the damage is done .
As someone once said , though , where do these men go to get their reputations back ?
HAVANA ( Reuters ) - Eight Americans graduated on Tuesday from a Cuban medical school after six years of studies fully funded by Fidel Castro ’s government .
Slideshow ( 7 images )
They plan to return home , take board exams for licenses to practice and provide cheap health care in poor neighborhoods .
“ Cuba offered us full scholarships to study medicine here .
In exchange , we commit ourselves to go back to our communities to provide health care to underserved people , ” said Carmen Landau , 30 , of Oakland , California .
The program is part of Castro ’s pet project to send thousands of Cuban doctors abroad to tend to the poor in developing countries , such as Venezuela and Bolivia , and train tens of thousand of medical students from developing countries in Cuba .
Officials in Cuba ’s communist government relish the idea of training doctors for the United States , its arch - enemy since Castro took power in a leftist revolution in 1959 .
The ailing Cuban leader , 80 , did not attend the graduation for 850 students from 25 countries at Havana ’s Karl Marx theater .
He has not appeared in public since intestinal surgery forced him to hand over power to his brother Raul Castro a year ago .
There are 88 Americans studying medicine in Cuba .
The first to graduate two years ago was Cedric Edwards , who is now working at Montefiore Hospital in New York City ’s Bronx borough .
The U.S. students praised Cuba ’s universal , free health - care system , which is community based and focuses on preventing illness before it becomes more serious and costly , in contrast to the U.S. health industry indicted for being profit - based in Michael Moore ’s recent film “ SiCKO . ”
“ We have studied medicine with a humanitarian approach , ” said Kenya Bingham , 29 , of Alameda , California .
“ Health care is not seen as a business in Cuba .
When you are sick , they are not going to try to charge you or turn you away if you do n’t have insurance , ” she said .
The main difference in studying in Cuba was that there was no charge and the graduates can begin their practice debt - free , said Jose De Leon , 27 , from Oakland .
“ When medical doctors graduate in the United States they are usually in debt , between $ 250,000 to $ 500,000 , and spend the first 10 years of their careers paying it off , ” he said .
That , Landau said , requires rushing patients in and out to earn more .
“ ‘ SiCKO ’ was an inspiration , ” said Landau , who plans to return to the United States to help promote the creation of a universal health - care system .
“ It is a wonderful idea that makes total sense in every country , especially in one with so many resources .
If they can do it in Cuba , we can do it in the United States , ” she said .

Linux & Scaling : The Essentials -- reallylinux.com Linux & Scaling : The Essentials
by Mark Rais , senior editor for reallylinux.com and author of Linux for the Rest of Us 2nd Ed. TOP Related Article : People who read this article also read Fundamentals of Massive Linux Scaling .

J ust days prior to the release of the STAR report that filled headlines back in the 1990's our operations team installed and configured twenty DEC Alpha's .
The assumption was that we were going to see some seriously high volume and needed web servers capable of processing the spikes .
As some of you may recall , that day 's web volume was indeed massive .
The infrastructure setup at the congressional website choked within a short period of time , and soon even large media outlets were failing to keep up with the requests .
I vividly remember quietly listening to one of the many operation status calls that day , when someone interrupted the conversation and notified us that a person from the Congressional office was being patched into the call .
The question posed to the OPS personnel by this gentleman went something like this : " You 're one of the few sites still delivering the report .
How do we get a machine like yours ? "
To which came a few muffled chuckles , followed by a mildly terse retort from an engineer who obviously had n't slept for over 36 hours , " Sir , it 's not a machine ... "
There was more to the conversation but it clarifies my point .
Scaling was and still is a major issue for all growing organizations .
And scaling failures often result from a serious lack of experience with alternative systems .
" Scaling is still a major issue for all growing organizations . "
A number of web sites I 've been involved with that started just fine using Microsoft servers ended up becoming either bloated messes , or simply choked on ever increasing loads .
I 've led several major re-architectures in my life .
It takes a lot of time and money to scrap and revamp , especially if scaling is a core issue .
The key is to setup infrastructure with systems that scale without major effort or costly re-architectures .
A few years ago a major deal was made between AOL and CBS regarding the TV reality show " Big Brother . "
At that time , a couple of my engineers and a handful of some of the best operations and network personnel you could wish for setup infrastructure that would handle what we anticipated to be something around the range of 250,000 hits per minute or around 4,000 hits per second .
We were dead wrong .
Actually the non-technical people estimated we might see roughly 50,000 hits per second multiplied or more , but few of us expected this as reality .
Regardless , up popped the website url on the show and a good chunk of those 10 million viewers of the premier show flipped on their computers and came running down the Internet pipe straight for our systems .
You want to know what it looks like when you see a spike like that ?
My lead engineer is pulling his hair out , the database engineer keeps yelling " the requests are n't getting through to the database , " and the operations personnel are scrambling to try to cut the pipe before every network switch over loads under the volume .
Oh , and every executive near a phone is screaming at someone under them to fix the problem !
I recall getting numbers later indicating something around 800,000 hits per second .
Regardless what exactly happened that night , some try to forget it all together , it was a bit much and everyone knew it .
So , as obvious as this may sound now , reflected through hind sight , the engineers converted all of the dynamic content into static html and rdist'ed content to every available web server .
These outstanding and quick thinking engineers got the site backup within a couple hours , now running as static html on over 220 servers at a continuous 105 % .
Ironically , by then the heaviest volume of users had already melted away .
At this time someone came up with an unwritten rule :
Web servers under peak need to deliver a sustainable 1,000 hits per second and that routing to the infrastructure has to have latency times less than 1/10th of a second .
Let me assure you that at the time this kind of infrastructure cost A LOT OF MONEY !
However , today , it is not uncommon for a home grown Linux and Apache website to support these specifications for under a couple thousand dollars .
IT IS FAR CHEAPER TODAY TO REACH THIS GOAL .
Linux and Apache , I propose , have changed the face of scaling and Internet serving forever .
" No kidding . " you might add .
You 've already figured this out .
" Linux & Apache , I propose , have changed the face of scaling and Internet serving forever . "
However , there are many organizations that simply do not understand the principal and continue to try scaling their Microsoft based web serving infrastructure .
The result is inevitably to pass the point of diminishing returns but become too attached to change .
Or , the result is to simply throw more and more resources and money at the issue .
In one recent example , I helped a non-profit organization setup an intranet server to support roughly 150 people .
This is utterly small fry .
I used a basic server , Linux , and Apache along with a few other OpenSource free software .
The result was a stable , reasonable performance intranet site for less than $ 700 .
At the same time , their technology leadership , who were versed exclusively with Microsoft products , purchased other hardware , Microsoft server licenses , and a dynamic intranet software for a second system at the cost of roughly $ 6,500 , not including the consulting fees .
And even with this the server was slow .
Scaling is just not the same when trying to address web server infrastructure between Linux and Microsoft OS worlds .
Not even Microsoft misses this point .
They have been using UNIX based systems for their key infrastructure all the way back to the late 1990s .
It often took four times as many of their own servers to match the same throughput so they switched .
Today there is no doubt that Microsoft employs some Apache web servers for their MSN infrastructure , and I recall the days when hotmail was choking on volume and moved entirely OFF NT SYSTEMS to a more viable UNIX derivative ( FreeBSD ) .
There are of course reasons behind all of this .
Likely it has some to do with the bowels of software components which make up IIS , Microsoft 's core web server , as well as some overarching aspects of the OS itself .
However , I really prefer to focus more on why UNIX like systems have been effectively driving high volume web traffic for a long time .
" Apache is a formidable and professional web server that incorporates a decade of experience . "
Apache is n't just a nifty name that conjures up images of the wild west and horses .
It 's a formidable and professional web server that incorporates a decade of experience .
But underlying the Apache 's core capabilities , and frankly the simplistic efficiency of the HTTPd , are the principles found in all UNIX variants for effectively handling threaded applications , memory management , and network protocols .
That 's also why Apache on Microsoft might very well have resulted in the same limited scaling solution you see today with IIS .
What makes this so apparent is that using Microsoft products often adds complexity .
You take an ADS environment , tie it to the NT infrastructure and a SAN that 's incorporating Exchange server and then drop in an IIS server or two or three and you are going to have the darndest time just trying to figure out how you do basic things like architect failovers into the infrastructure .
Not to mention what you will need to do to try to address future scaling .
One approach hailed by some is to use the wonderful power of the DNS round - robin to add redundant servers ... except the Microsoft DNS services require you to manually intervene when one of those systems goes down .
It all seems so complex and so manually intensive in my opinion .
Now take a different approach .
Take a simple Linux & Apache model within existing organizational infrastructure .
Take this model and add OpenExchange , add SAMBA services to accommodate the existing Microsoft ADS logins , add a SAN using RAID0 on large disks for the static content backups and RAID5 striping for the volatile data needs ( on smaller disks mind you , to avoid death by positional latency ) and you may actually have something beautiful .
Perhaps a piece of art in some people 's eyes .
In my own view you have a very robust , wide breath , great depth , highly scalable infrastructure without the complexity .
Costs less too .
But forget cost for now .
Consider this .
I need to now take this same infrastructure and support multiple web properties delivering dynamic content to users that often appear in spikes .
Scaling this thing becomes a matter of properly placing the servers and a few switches for failover response .
Sounds easy ?
It is reasonably so .
Best of all , what I need to scale an Apache server running hot ( over 105 % peak ) is to simply add some more inexpensive hardware .
No software complexity , no integration clutter , and no licensing fees .
I hope this brief encapsulation provides you with a reasonable perspective why Linux and Apache are increasingly vital infrastructure components to any growing organization .
Scaling matters , and in the Linux world , scaling is integrated by design .

There have been some attempts to pass off this White House / RNC rush to destroy the evidence with a shrug and a " How unfortunate , but these emails are systematically deleted as a matter of common practice . "
But that ’s not true , because if it were , it would be true for ALL of the RNC email accounts .
But the distribution of reported deletions is clearly biased to those accounts that would be more likely to be investigated .
I simply can not believe that there are n’t multiple backups of ALL of this stuff .
It is such a basic IT practice .
Every large organization , and the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) is certainly one of these , backs up its email .
This is a common practice for the simple reason that servers fail .
The hardware can fail for lots of reasons , email databases can be " corrupted " ( index information is destroyed so although the email is there , your map to where it is stored is lost ) , and viruses can infect the email database .
So organizations back up email databases , usually daily .
The most recent backup is kept on another server .
If the email system crashes , you copy over yesterday ’s backup to a clean machine and restart .
You do n’t discard these backups for a long time .
Years .
After a few days , backup files are moved to more permanent media , like digital tape or CDs or DVDs , and put in a safe place .
Companies that do not do this for themselves hire IT firms to manage it for them .
I have no problem believing that most of the RNC office staff may think that if they print an email and run it through a shredder , then it ’s gone .
But anyone with ANY exposure to this stuff knows that old files never die , they just get archived , both in the sender ’s environment and in the recipient ’s .
If the NSA were n’t currently serving as Bush & Co ’s personal Band of Dementors , they could probably gather this stuff up in about 20 minutes .
The RNC email servers and all of these file backups represent the highest grade of information available for the decisions that comprise the Attorney General ’s scandal , the Abu Ghraib human rights violations , and who knows what other criminal acts spewing from this administration .
These materials need to be seized and handed over to an unbiased / unbought group for forensic investigation .
It ’s a crime that they tried to destroy this evidence .
But I do n’t believe that this content is really gone , because it is really hard to kill it all .
And I want to know what ’s in those emails .
That ’s where the impeachment gold is .
The dead bees under Dennis vanEngelsdorp ’s microscope were like none he had ever seen .
He had expected to see mites or amoebas , perennial pests of bees .
Instead , he found internal organs swollen with debris and strangely blackened .
The bees ’ intestinal tracts were scarred , and their rectums were abnormally full of what appeared to be partly digested pollen .
Dark marks on the sting glands were telltale signs of infection .
“ The more you looked , the more you found , ” said VanEngelsdorp , the acting apiarist for the state of Pennsylvania .
“ Each thing was a surprise . ”
VanEngelsdorp ’s examination of the bees in November was one of the first scientific glimpses of a mysterious honeybee die - off that has launched an intense search for a cure .
The puzzling phenomenon , known as Colony Collapse Disorder , or CCD , has been reported in 35 states , five Canadian provinces and several European countries .
The die - off has cost U.S. beekeepers about $ 150 million in losses and an uncertain amount for farmers scrambling to find bees to pollinate their crops .
Scientists have scoured the country , finding eerily abandoned hives in which the bees seem to have simply left their honey and broods of baby bees .
“ We ’ve never experienced bees going off and leaving brood behind , ” said Pennsylvania - based beekeeper Dave Hackenberg .
“ It was like a mother going off and leaving her kids . ”
Researchers have picked through the abandoned hives , dissected thousands of bees , and tested for viruses , bacteria , pesticides and mites .
So far , they are stumped .
According to the Apiary Inspectors of America , 24 % of 384 beekeeping operations across the country lost more than 50 % of their colonies from September to March .
Some have lost 90 % .
“ I ’m worried about the bees , ” said Dan Boyer , 52 , owner of Ridgetop Orchards in Fishertown , Pa. , which grows apples .
“ The more I learn about it , the more I think it is a national tragedy . ”
At Boyer ’s orchard , 400 acres of apple trees -- McIntosh , Honey Crisp , Red Delicious and 11 other varieties -- have just begun to bud white flowers .
Boyer ’s trees need to be pollinated .
Incompletely pollinated blooms would still grow apples , he said , but the fruit would be small and misshapen , suitable only for low - profit juice .
This year , he will pay dearly for the precious bees -- $ 13,000 for 200 hives , the same price that 300 hives cost him last year .
The scene is being repeated throughout the country , where honeybees , scientifically known as Apis mellifera , are required to pollinate a third of the nation ’s food crops , including almonds , cherries , blueberries , pears , strawberries and pumpkins .
Vanishing colonies
One of the earliest alarms was sounded by Hackenberg , who used to keep about 3,000 hives in dandelion - covered fields near the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania .
In November , Hackenberg , 58 , was at his winter base in Florida .
He peeked in on a group of 400 beehives he had driven down from his home in West Milton , Pa. , a month before .
He went from empty box to empty box .
Only about 40 had bees in them .
“ It was just the most phenomenal thing I thought I ’d ever seen , ” he said .
The next morning , Hackenberg called Jerry Hayes , the chief of apiary inspection at the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services and president of the Apiary Inspectors of America .
Hayes mentioned some bee die - offs in Georgia that , until then , had n’t seemed significant .
Hackenberg drove back to West Milton with a couple of dead beehives and live colonies that had survived .
He handed them over to researchers at Pennsylvania State University .
With amazing speed , the bees vanished from his other hives , more than 70 % of which were abandoned by February .
Hackenberg , a talkative , wiry man with a deeply lined face , figured he lost more than $ 460,000 this winter for replacement bees , lost honey and missed pollination opportunities .
“ If that happens again , we ’re out of business , ” he said .
It did n’t take researchers long to figure out they were dealing with something new .
VanEngelsdorp , 37 , quickly eliminated the most obvious suspects : Varroa and tracheal mites , which have occasionally wrought damage on hives since the 1980s .
At the state lab in Harrisburg , Pa. , VanEngelsdorp checked bee samples from Pennsylvania and Georgia .
He washed bees with soapy water to dislodge Varroa mites and cut the thorax of the bees to look for tracheal mites ; he found that the number of mites was not unusually high .
His next guess was amoebic infection .
He scanned the bees ’ kidneys for cysts and found a handful , but not enough to explain the population decline .
VanEngelsdorp dug through scientific literature looking for other mass disappearances .
He found the first reference in a 1869 federal report , detailing a mysterious bee disappearance .
There was only speculation as to the cause -- possibly poisonous honey or maybe a hot summer .
A 1923 handbook on bee culture noted that a “ disappearing disease ” went away in a short time without treatment .
There was a reference to “ fall dwindle ” in a 1965 scientific article to describe sudden disappearances in Texas and Louisiana .
He found other references but no explanations .
VanEngelsdorp traveled to Florida and California at the beginning of the year to collect adult bees , brood , nectar , pollen and comb for a more systematic study .
He went to 11 apiaries , both sick and healthy , and collected 102 colonies .
A number of the pollen samples went to Maryann Frazier , a honeybee specialist at Penn State who has been coordinating the pesticide investigation .
Her group has been testing for 106 chemicals used to kill mites , funguses or other pests .
Scientists have focused on a new group of pesticides known as neonicotinoids , which have spiked in popularity because they are safe for people , Frazier said .
Studies have shown that these pesticides can kill bees and throw off their ability to learn and navigate , she said .
Researchers have yet to collect enough data to come to any conclusions , but the experience of French beekeepers casts doubt on the theory .
France banned the most commonly used neonicotinoid in 1999 after complaints from beekeepers that it was killing their colonies .
French hives , however , are doing no better now , experts said .
Sniffing out the culprit
Entomologist Jerry J. Bromenshenk of the University of Montana launched his own search for poisons , relying on the enhanced odor sensitivity of bees -- about 40 times better than that of humans .
When a colony is exposed to a new chemical odor , he said , its sound changes in volume and frequency , producing a unique audio signature .
Bromenshenk has been visiting beekeepers across the country , recording hive sounds and taking them back to his lab for analysis .
To date , no good candidates have surfaced .
If the cause is not a poison , it is most likely a parasite .
UC San Francisco researchers announced in April that they had found a single - celled protozoan called Nosema ceranae in bees from colonies with the collapse disorder .
Unfortunately , Bromenshenk said , “ we see equal levels of Nosema in CCD colonies and healthy colonies . ”
Infected swarms ?
Several researchers , including entomologist Diana Cox -Foster of Penn State and Dr. W. Ian Lipkin , a virologist at Columbia University , have been sifting through bees that have been ground up , looking for viruses and bacteria .
“ We were shocked by the huge number of pathogens present in each adult bee , ” Cox -Foster said at a recent meeting of bee researchers convened by the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
The large number of pathogens suggested , she said , that the bees ’ immune systems had been suppressed , allowing the proliferation of infections .
The idea that a pathogen is involved is supported by recent experiments conducted by VanEngelsdorp and USDA entomologist Jeffrey S. Pettis .
One of the unusual features of the disorder is that the predators of abandoned beehives , such as hive beetles and wax moths , refuse to venture into infected hives for weeks or longer .
“ It ’s as if there is something repellent or toxic about the colony , ” said Hayes , the Florida inspector .
To test this idea , VanEngelsdorp and Pettis set up 200 beehive boxes with new , healthy bees from Australia and placed them in the care of Hackenberg .
Fifty of the hives were irradiated to kill potential pathogens .
Fifty were fumigated with concentrated acetic acid , a hive cleanser commonly used in Canada .
Fifty were filled with honey frames that had been taken from Hackenberg ’s colonies before the collapse , and the last 50 were hives that had been abandoned that winter .
When VanEngelsdorp visited the colonies at the beginning of May , bees in the untouched hive were clearly struggling , filling only about a quarter of a frame .
Bees living on the reused honeycomb were alive but not thriving .
A hive that had been fumigated with acetic acid was better .
When he popped open an irradiated hive , bees were crawling everywhere .
“ This does imply there is something biological , ” he said .
If it is a pathogen or a parasite , honeybees are poorly equipped to deal with it , said entomologist May Berenbaum of the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign .
The honeybee genome has only half as many genes to detoxify poisons and to fight off infections as do other insects .
“ There is something about the life of the honeybee that has led to the loss of a lot of genes associated with detoxification , associated with the immune system , ” she said .
In the absence of knowledge , theories have proliferated , including one that Osama bin Laden has engineered the die - off to disrupt American agriculture .
One of the most pervasive theories is that cellphone transmissions are causing the disappearances -- an idea that originated with a recent German study .
Berenbaum called the theory “ a complete figment of the imagination . ”
The German physicist who conducted the tiny study “ disclaimed the connection to cellphones , ” she said .
“ What they put in the colony was a cordless phone .
Whoever translated the story did n’t know the difference . ”
Another popular theory is that the bees have been harmed by corn genetically engineered to contain the pesticide B.t .
Berenbaum shot down the idea : “ Here in Illinois , we ’re surrounded by an ocean of B.t. pollen , and the bees are not afflicted . ”
And so the search continues .
Many beekeepers have few options but to start rebuilding .
Gene Brandi , a veteran beekeeper based in Los Banos , Calif. , lost 40 % of his 2,000 colonies this winter .
Brandi knows plenty of beekeepers who sold their equipment at bargain prices .
Scurrying around a blackberry farm near Watsonville , Brandi , 55 , was restocking his bees .
In a white jumpsuit and yellow bee veil , he pulled out a frame of honeycomb from a hive that had so many bees they were spilling out the front entrance .
“ When it ’s going good like this , you forget CCD , ” he said .
Hackenberg , who has spent his whole life in the business , is n’t giving up either .
He borrowed money and restocked with bees from Australia .
In April , the normally hale Hackenberg started feeling short of breath .
His doctor said he was suffering from stress and suggested he slow down .
Not now , Hackenberg thought .
“ I ’m going to go down fighting . ”

After Etherfast presented the world ’s smallest PC , we were invaded with comments and feedback .
One of them linked to what I am going to present .
It ’s called Jack PC , and it can fit into a network wall port .
Just plug your keyboard , mouse and monitor into the wall .
The Jack PC runs Windows CE and it ’s equipped with an equivalent of a 800MHz to 1.2GHz x86 desktop processor .
The Jack PC comes in 3 models , ranging from �209 to �349 , and it ’s produced by a company in Israel , called Chip PC Technologies .
So , if you ’re fed up with your big old PC , you can always get a replacement the size of a small box , or one that can fit into your wall .
Below are several pictures of the latter .
( Note : If you enlarge them , please be patient ) .
Could this be the future of PCs ?
And , with a little bluetooth here and a little infrared there , would it mean that we could get the same , but wireless ?
Again , thanks to iravelo for giving us the tip .
You can see extended details on this PC here and here .

Am I the only one who noticed ?
I hope not .
But just in case , let me note that Vice President Dick Cheney made a huge misstatement to his West Point audience on May 26 .
I hope that , at a minimum , the West Point history majors noticed it .
Near the end of his speech at the United States Military Academy commencement , Mr. Cheney stated :
" On your first day of Army life , each one of you raised your right hand and took an oath .
And you will swear again today to defend the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic .
That is your vow , that is the business you ’re in . "
Well , not quite .
Here is the actual oath that newly minted officers in the U.S.
Army take :
" I ( insert name ) , having been appointed a ( insert rank ) in the U.S.
Army under the conditions indicated in this document , do accept such appointment and do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic , that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same ; that I take this obligation freely , without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion ; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter , so help me God . "
Notice the difference ?
Mr. Cheney claims that U.S. Army officers vow to defend the United States , but as the oath quoted above shows , they do n’t .
Instead , they vow to defend the U.S. Constitution .
As a former student of mine , an officer in the U.S. military , said , " Professor , is n’t it interesting that our highest obligation is not to protect the United States but , instead , is to protect the U.S. Constitution ? "
Yes , it is interesting .
Actually , more than just the history majors should have noticed it .
All of the graduating cadets should have noticed because , after all , what good is an oath if you do n’t remember it ?
Did Mr. Cheney simply make a casual mistake ?
It ’s possible .
But in the rest of his speech , he described life at West Point in punctilious detail .
He mentioned Thayer Gate , R - Day , and Lake Frederick , all things that are known to West Pointers and all evidence of a well - staffed speech .
I can say confidently , based on my time in the White House as a senior economist under Ronald Reagan , that speeches by the president and the vice president are carefully checked for the tiniest of details .
That makes it hard to believe that someone did n’t point out what the oath actually says .
And , if someone did , then it would appear that Mr. Cheney preferred to have it his way and state his ersatz oath .
Why would he do that ?
I do n’t know , but here ’s my best guess .
The Bush administration has landed a few body blows on the U.S. Constitution .
Let me give two significant examples .
First , by signing the McCain - Feingold campaign finance law in 2002 , President Bush violated the First Amendment , which says that " Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech . "
In his signing statement , President Bush even admitted , in Washington - speak , that the law violated the Constitution .
Which means , by the way , that President Bush knowingly violated the oath he took " to preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States . "
The Bush administration ’s second major violation of the Constitution was its restriction of habeas corpus , which , according to Article I , Section 9 of the Constitution , " shall not be suspended , unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it . "
By signing the Military Commissions Act of 2006 , President Bush took away this protection that has existed in some form in many countries since the Magna Carta of 1215 .
Robert Levy , a legal scholar whose work I generally respect highly , has argued that the law does not end habeas corpus for U.S. citizens ; I ’m not informed enough to know .
But I do know that it ends habeas corpus for non-citizens , and nowhere in the U.S. Constitution does it state that the protections from government are extended only to U.S. citizens .
I do not claim the above two examples to be the Bush administration ’s only violations of the U.S. Constitution .
But they are two very important ones .
Although the Supreme Court , the president , and the Congress thumbed their collective noses decades ago at the Constitution ’s protection of economic freedom , the First Amendment ’s protection of freedom of speech has been much more respected .
McCain - Feingold , therefore , is a huge negative step .
So also with the suspension of habeas corpus , even if this suspension applies only to non-citizens .
Vice President Cheney might have had another motive for substituting " United States " for " Constitution of the United States " in his version of the oath .
Michael Roston has highlighted Mr. Cheney ’s pointing out that although U.S. military officers must follow the U.S. Constitution and the Geneva Conventions , their enemies do n’t have those same " delicate sensibilities " when they " wage attacks or take captives . "
Mr. Roston argues that Cheney was attacking the Geneva Conventions .
I ’m not so sure , although I think a good case can be made for Mr. Roston ’s conclusion .
But whatever Mr. Cheney ’s view on the Geneva Conventions , he did implicitly attack or , at a minimum , slight the U.S. Constitution .
Should one of the graduating cadets , upon taking the oath , have taken it seriously by pointing out Mr. Cheney ’s mistake ?

Bicycle taillights were among the first products in which conventional light bulbs were replaced by light - emitting diodes .
The diodes ’ relatively low power consumption allowed manufacturers to use smaller and lighter batteries .
At first , L.E.D. taillights suffered from being somewhat dim .
But that is not a limitation of the DiNotte Tail Light ( www.dinottelighting.com).
The lamp , which vaguely resembles a short , fat lipstick tube , holds a three - watt L.E.D. , making it more powerful than many bicycle headlights .

On full power , the light projects a large beam of red light well behind the bicycle .
The effect is a bit like carrying a red emergency flare .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A Middle Eastern businessman spent over $ 210,000 in a five - hour , champagne - and vodka - fuelled spending spree in a London nightclub at the weekend .
Fraser Donaldson , a representative of Crystal , a club favored by Prince Harry , said in 20 years working in the industry it was the biggest bill he ’d seen from one customer .
The unnamed big spender entered Crystal at midnight on Saturday with friends -- nine women and eight men -- and ordered a $ 50 bottle of white wine , a spokesman for the club said .
But before long he was ordering magnums of Dom Perignon at $ 1,400 each and then called for a Methuselah -- eight bottles in one -- of Cristal Champagne at $ 60,000 and the party spread .
The festivities ended with a “ night cap ” consisting of a Methuselah of Belvedere vodka , which cost $ 2,800 .
“ He basically just said , ‘ keep the drinks flowing , ’ ” the club spokesman said .
When the party left at 5 a.m. , the bill was 81,471.50 pounds , which with tax and service added amounted to 105,805.28 pounds -- $ 218,000 .
It included the cost of six Coca - Colas .
