If Isaac Newton had access to a supercomputer , he'd have had it watch apples fall – and let it figure out the physical matters .
But the computer would have needed to run an algorithm , just developed by Cornell researchers , which can derive natural laws from observed data .
The researchers have taught a computer to find regularities in the natural world that become established laws – yet without any prior scientific knowledge on the part of the computer .
They have tested their method , or algorithm , on simple mechanical systems and believe it could be applied to more complex systems ranging from biology to cosmology and be useful in analyzing the mountains of data generated by modern experiments that use electronic data collection .
The research is published in the journal Science ( April 3 , 2009 ) by Hod Lipson , Cornell associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering , and graduate student Michael Schmidt , a specialist in computational biology .
Their process begins by taking the derivatives of every variable observed with respect to every other – a mathematical way of measuring how one quantity changes as another changes .
Then the computer creates equations at random using various constants and variables from the data .
It tests these against the known derivatives , keeps the equations that come closest to predicting correctly , modifies them at random and tests again , repeating until it literally evolves a set of equations that accurately describe the behavior of the real system .
Technically , the computer does not output equations , but finds " invariants " – mathematical expressions that remain true all the time .
" Even though it looks like it 's changing erratically , there is always something deeper there that is always constant , " Lipson explained .
" That 's the hint to the underlying physics .
You want something that does n't change , but the relationship between the variables in it changes in a way that 's similar to [ what we see in ] the real system . "
Once the invariants are found , potentially all equations describing the system are available : " All equations regarding a system must fit into and satisfy the invariants , " Schmidt said .
" But of course we still need a human interpreter to take this step . "
The researchers tested the method with apparatus used in freshman physics courses : a spring - loaded linear oscillator , a single pendulum and a double pendulum .
Given data on position and velocity over time , the computer found energy laws , and for the pendulum , the law of conservation of momentum .
Given acceleration , it produced Newton 's second law of motion .
The researchers point out that the computer evolves these laws without any prior knowledge of physics , kinematics or geometry .
But evolution takes time .
On a parallel computer with 32 processors , simple linear motion could be analyzed in a few minutes , but the complex double pendulum required 30 to 40 hours of computation .
The researchers found that seeding the complex pendulum problem with terms from equations for the simple pendulum cut processing time to seven or eight hours .
This " bootstrapping , " they said , is similar to the way human scientists build on previous work .
Computers will not make scientists obsolete , the researchers conclude .
Rather , they said , the computer can take over the grunt work , helping scientists focus quickly on the interesting phenomena and interpret their meaning .
Rabid with Debt
“ How do you feel now ? ” asked a reporter for a local investment magazine .
“ I mean , you ’re a contrarian … and you were right about so much ? ”
“ Not exactly , ” we explained .
“ Yes , we saw the problem coming .
And we expected the government would do all the wrong things – which it has .
But we never imagined that they ’d do so many stupid things all at once . ”
There are only two examples from modern history of depressions such as this – the ’30s in America and the ’90s in Japan .
Both times , the governments did stupid things .
But this time , the U.S. government has outdone them all .
They ’ve committed $ 13 trillion to programs that make no sense theoretically … and have never worked when they ’ve been tried .
If you ’ll recall , the dog that bit the world economy was rabid with debt .
The feds are trying the old ‘ hair of the dog ’ technique .
But they ’ve rounded up every mangy cur and stray bitch in the country .
And now they ’re adding debt to the world economy at a much faster rate than ever in history .
Of course , as feral economists , we love it .
We never thought we ’d see such a thing .
Gone are the mealy - mouthed reservations of cautious economists .
Gone are the hesitant … hedged … halfway measures .
They ’re pulling out on the stops .
It ’s the pedal to the metal …it ’s hell for leather …
What a bold experiment !
What a brave undertaking !
What a crackpot thing to do !
They must think the planet is under attack from aliens .
It ’s as if the survival of the human race were at stake .
Nearly the entire output of the largest economy on the planet for an entire year – debt , not savings – is being spent to …to … to … well …to do what ?
To try to stop the speculators from getting what they deserve !
But wait …it gets even madder .
Of course , if you put food out in the alley , it ’s bound to attract rats .
Not surprising then , that the government ’s bailout cash is giving rise to an astonishing number of new fraud and money laundering accusations .
The complex nature of the bailout program makes it “ inherently vulnerable to fraud , waste and abuse , including significant issues relating to conflicts of interest facing fund managers , collusion between participants , and vulnerabilities to money laundering , ” says an internal government report .
“ You do n’t need an entirely corrupt institution to pull one of these schemes off , ” said an expert .
“ You only need a few corrupt managers whose compensation may be tied to the performance of these assets in order to effectively pull off a collusion or a kickback scheme . ”
But do n’t worry .
The feds are on the case .
They ’re said to be investigating .
Just the way they did with Bernie Madoff .
And who knows ?
Maybe the crooks will tell their families … and maybe the sons and daughters will turn them in , just like they did with Bernie .
There are always a few rotten apples in every barrel .
But from here at The Daily Reckoning ’s South American headquarters in Buenos Aires they all look brown to us .
Even Business
Week magazine opines that the whole bailout program is nothing more than a scheme to pick the pockets of the nation ’s retirees in order to give the money to rich bankers .
“ Monday afternoon , Goldman Sachs ( GS ) reported much larger than expected first - quarter profits on the heels of the strong earnings Wells Fargo ( WFC ) reported last week .
“ No one should be surprised .
“ The Fed has permitted the banks and financial houses to park vast sums of unmarketable paper on its books – securities made nearly worthless by the misjudgment and avarice of bankers .
In return , the Fed has provided these paragons of finance with fresh , cheap funds to lend at healthy rates on credit cards , auto loans , and even mortgages .
“ While the Fed cuts the banks slack , the bankers are busy turning the screws on their debtors by raising credit card rates and fees , and harassing distressed borrowers with all the zeal the Roman army displayed sacking Palestine .
“ It takes good banking skills to borrow at 3 % , lend at 5 % , and make a profit .
It takes much less business acumen to borrow at 2 % , lend at 5 % , and make a profit – which is exactly what has happened .
The extra fees are just gravy .
“ This all comes at a cost to someone – America ’s elderly .
“ Many retirees depend on interest from certificates of deposit .
Those rates are down dramatically and as CDs expire , retirees are compelled to reinvest their savings at lower rates and live on less income .
They can take comfort that their sacrifices are helping pay off Wall Street ’s losses from the lavish bonuses that were paid bankers – for example , the $ 70.3 million Goldman doled out to CEO Lloyd Blankfein in 2007 . ”
We do n’t envy the feds .
So many pockets to pick … so little time .
Make sure you are n’t among those who find themselves bled dry by the government ’s bailouts .
Now , we turn to Addison with a look at China ’s recent gold accumulation :
“ As we ’ve been suspecting , the Chinese have been accumulating gold , slowly but surely . ”
Writes Addison in today ’s 5 Minute Forecast .
“ They made the announcement this morning .
Really , what would you do if you were sitting on $ 1.9 trillion in foreign reserves – more than half of it minted in U.S. dollars ?
“ The State Administration of Foreign Exchange says China ’s reserves now total 1054 metric tons – up from 600 in 2003 .
If you ’re keeping score at home , that ’s a 76 % increase in 5 years .
“ These new numbers place China fifth among nations that disclose their gold holdings – just ahead of Switzerland .
“ Given pronouncements made by premier Wen leading up to the G20 meeting last month , you can count on them to pick up a fair share of the $ 12 billion the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) plans to sell this year . ”

And back to Bill for more memories of his Argentine adventure :
“ Macho … ” Jorge shouted .
“ Alto ! ”
“ Macho ” was not the right thing to be during the roundup season .
It was like being long banks in September of 2008 ; you were going to get killed .
“ If ever you are in the sluices , ” we warned Elizabeth , “ and they say ‘ Alto ! ’ you should make a run for it . ”
“ Macho ” means male .
And on a cattle ranch , male animals are few .
The ratio is one bull per 20 cows .
The finest of the young males are spared … and destined to a life of procreation .
The rest get sent “ alto ” – to the upper field … and then to the slaughterhouse ( usually after being fattened up a bit before they get there ) .
We brought about 400 cattle over the pass from Compuel .
As far as we know , only three died .
One calf made it all the way to the corral down at the ranch and then fell down .
We left it alone on the ground … hoping it would get back on its feet .
It never did .
“ There was something wrong with it before we left , ” Jorge warned .
The vaqueros would normally cut up a fallen calf and have it for dinner .
This one , they did n’t dare eat .
The other two dead cows died of wounds inflected by the vaqueros themselves .
One – a fat young black steer – was singled out of early retirement … it was the quest of honor at a barbecue at the ranch house .
The other was cut up by the vaqueros and portioned out between them .
We saw it when we headed back up the hill to the house at lunchtime .
It was on its back and on the ground …
Three vaqueros were working on it .
Its hide had already been cut off .
Even from the head .
Otherwise , the animal was still intact .
Pedro was beginning to cut the head off with a saw as we passed .
Later in the day , the skinned head , with horns , sat on the wall like a devil ’s head .
The vaqueros made the sign of the crucifix when they walked in front of it .
Every once in a while , the bulls would begin pushing against each other .
Once they got into such a squabble they broke through the main gate .
Another time , a huge bull charged where we were working .
All of us jumped the fence or climbed the sluice to get away .
Then , we got back to work …
“ Macho…alto ! ” “ Hembra … bajo . ” ( Female …to the lower paddock . )
Jorge judged every animal .
As each animal got stuck in the jaws of the sepa , a whole team got to work .
One of the vaqueros injected it against brucellosis .
Another gave it an anti-parasite medicine .
Cosimir , a young man wearing a red trucker ’s cap , put a pair of tongs in its nose and gave a tug … forcing open its mouth so we could look at the teeth .
We watched Cosimir ’s face … intent on his work ; each time he pulled on the tongs , his own mouth opened … his tongue went out to the side .
“ Sin dientes …alto . ” ( No teeth … upper paddock . )
“ Llena boca … bajo . ”
( All her teeth … lower paddock . )
Each cow was also treated to an ear tag and an earmark .
Each yellow plastic tag has a number , so the animal can be identified and recorded .
The tags are punctured through the ears like rings .
Then , a v-shaped cut is made in the ear too – further identifying the cow as one of ours .
The cows kicked and bawled .
But your editor had already closed the gate behind them .
And Pedro had closed the sepa on their necks .
They were stuck until we were finished with them .
Young macho calves were singled out for special torture .
Once the injections had been made , ears cut and pierced , a rawhide rope was put around their necks .
They were dragged into a small paddock next to the sepa .
Then , they were held down by two vaqueros while the third cut off their testicles .
The first day , Edward , 15 , wearing boots and a cowboy hat , learned to lasso the young calves .
He was soon put to work helping Omar castrate the machos :
“ I just held them down .
Omar asked if I wanted to cut off their … well … you - know - what … but I did n’t want to do it .
He was using a Swiss Army knife .
I thought they used rubber bands .
That ’s what they use in France .
But Omar says the rubber bands are not always successful .
Sometimes they fall off .
This way , there ’s no doubt about it . ”
Over the three days , Edward helped castrate dozens of young calves .
We finished with the cows from Compuel on the first day .
By late afternoon , we were checking the horizon for signs of the second group .
For while we were working on the thin cows from the high country , other vaqueros were on out the range rounding up hundreds more of them .
Towards the north , we saw a cloud of dust .
“ There they are .
They ’ll be here in about an hour , ” Jorge calculated .
It was already nearly 6:30 pm .
The sun was going down .
Soon , it would be dark .
“ We ’ll get them into the big paddock … and work on them tomorrow , ” said Jorge .
The roundup lasted three long days .
From sun-up to sunset , the dust rose up from the corral , along with the yells of the cowhands – including your editor’s .
Without a break … the cowboys drove the cows into the sluices … the bright sun beat down … the injections … the frightened cows … the fighting bulls …
By the time the sun set behind the mountain in the West , your editor was worn out .
He could barely drag himself back up the hill to the ‘ sala ’ – the main ranch house .
But as he was going up the hill , he noticed , and not for the first time , what a beautiful place it was .
It ’s autumn in the Southern Hemisphere ; the alamo trees have turned golden .
Water is running in the streams .
The grass is green .
The sky is blue .
“ I think what makes this place so stunning are the vivid colors , ” said Elizabeth .
“ That …and the majesty of the setting . ”
One on side , in the distance , is the snow - covered Nevada de Cachi .
At the other , snow tops the Lomo de Negra too .
Between them is a broad valley with cattle , vineyards , pimento , llama , barren desert , stones , cactus , and dry moonscape rock formations as well as dense , bottomland vegetation .
Based partially on a top - secret blacklist of websites , Australia ’s program of Internet filtration is still in full force .
Government censorship recently resurfaced in the media when Australia ’s Communications Minister , Stephen Conroy , admitted that certain images were added to the blacklist in error and blamed the Russian mob for the addition of a dentist ’s site , according to reports in The Age .
Conroy ’s admission in late March of such errors casts doubt on the Government ’s ability to filter the Internet without the inadvertent censorship of appropriate and legitimate websites .
Conroy blamed the inclusion of an innocuous link on a “ technical error ” inside the Australian Communications and Media Authority , which compiles the top - secret blacklist .
The presence of legitimate websites on this list was only revealed in March .
According to The Age , examples of these websites included euthanasia sites , abortion sites , regular porn sites , and a site containing harmless Bill Henson photographs , among others .
In a widely publicized interview , Conroy continued his claim that the proposed censorship regime was sound because it targeted only “ refused classification ” content , although in practicality , many of the sites included in the classification were entirely legal to view .
Furthermore , Conroy admitted that the filtering program would be ineffective on peer - to - peer networks , where the majority of child pornography is traded .
Spokesman for an online users ’ lobby , Colin Jacobs , contends that “ this does n’t address questions of how the secret list is administered , how the Government hopes to classify millions or billions of web pages without making any mistakes , or why an expensive national filter has to be applied at the ISP level in the first place . ”
Major League Baseball officials want to entice fans to make the ballpark their vacation destination this year , and have they got a deal for you .
The economic downturn is affecting turnstiles , with MLB President Bob DuPuy saying group and individual sales are down 1 million as Sunday 's openers approach .
HAL STEINBRENNER : Admits tickets are overpriced
Major League Baseball launched a program Thursday to spread the word about affordable tickets and promotions at all 30 ballparks .
Teams hope to recoup some of the revenue lost in decreased season - ticket sales through walk - ups , and they see a growing market among families who have decided not to travel for vacation .
" All the cultural institutions , whether it be museums or sports outings , are going to be the things people turn to , " Los Angeles Dodgers CEO Jamie McCourt says .
" So we need to make this an opportunity to say , ' We 're happy you 're staying .
Now you can come to our games . ' "
According to the Team Marketing Report released Thursday , baseball remains the most affordable of the four major sports , with an average ticket price of $ 26.64 .
The next - closest competitor , the NBA , is at $ 49.47 .
Still , prices went up 5 % , with 16 teams raising their average , 10 decreasing and four staying flat .
The New York Yankees , moving into a new ballpark , led the increases at 76.3 % for an average ticket price of $ 72.97 .
" There 's no doubt small amounts of our tickets might be overpriced , " Yankees co-chairman Hal Steinbrenner told the Associated Press .
MLB 's initiative includes a feature at MLB.com called Fan Value Corner that highlights deep discounts , many on dates when single - ticket sales might be lagging .
Some executives acknowledge that season tickets have been a particularly hard sell .
Says San Francisco Giants President Larry Baer , whose club 's ticket base shrank by 2,500 , " There 's a certain amount of fear driving people to not want to make commitments in March for purchases in September . "
News Corp is planning to introduce micro-payments for individual articles from the Wall Street Journal .
Some may see this as a bold move to embrace a new business model , one that many ( dying ) newspapers are thinking about , but have n't yet had the courage to actually implement .
Without going into the intricacies of price and scaling ( managing editor of WSJ , Robert Thomson , says the price would be “ rightfully high , ” whatever that means ) , I see a very simple problem that will kill this idea right from the start .
If you put a price - any price - on an article in the Wall Street Journal , people will not be able to share it .
Sites like Mashable wo n't be able to link to it .
Digg , Twitter , StumbleUpon ... any content behind a paywall will receive zero traffic from all these social sites .
And that fact alone is enough for the entire system to fail , because the benefit of receiving money from a small portion of the readers will be outweighed by the fact that fewer people will see the content ( the additional consequence is the fact that other publications will inevitably grab the opportunity offer similar content for free ) .
Not to mention that free content - besides not costing you money - has the advantage of being simple to use , i.e. the readers do n't have to go through the additional payment step .
Perhaps someone over at News Corp has thought about this ; maybe they 're planning some sort of system that lets paying customers receive the content early , and then sets it free after a certain period of time .
I doubt even this would work , however , because on the Internet a couple of hours late is too late .
A paywall - any kind of paywall - will not solve newspapers ' problems .
The WSJ and other publications are , of course , welcome to try .

( CNN ) -- Rapid - fire TV news bulletins or getting updates via social - networking tools such as Twitter could numb our sense of morality and make us indifferent to human suffering , scientists say .
Scientists say updates on networking tools such as Twitter are often too quick for the brain to fully digest .
New findings show that the streams of information provided by social networking sites are too fast for the brain 's " moral compass " to process and could harm young people 's emotional development .
Before the brain can fully digest the anguish and suffering of a story , it is being bombarded by the next news bulletin or the latest Twitter update , according to a University of Southern California study .
" If things are happening too fast , you may not ever fully experience emotions about other people 's psychological states and that would have implications for your morality , " said researcher Mary Helen Immordino - Yang .
The report , published next week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Online Early Edition , studied how volunteers responded to real - life stories chosen to stimulate admiration for virtue or skill , or compassion for physical or social pain .
iReport.com : Growing pains for Twitter , Facebook ?
Brain scans showed humans can process and respond very quickly to signs of physical pain in others , but took longer to show admiration or compassion .
" For some kinds of thought , especially moral decision - making about other people 's social and psychological situations , we need to allow for adequate time and refection , " said Immordio - Yang .
She said the study raises questions about the emotional cost , particularly for young people , of heavy reliance on a torrent of news snippets delivered via TV and online feeds such as Twitter .
She said : " We need to understand how social experience shapes interactions between the body and mind , to produce citizens with a strong moral compass . "
USC sociologist Manuel Castells said the study raised more concerns over fast - moving TV than the online environment .
" In a media culture in which violence and suffering becomes an endless show , be it in fiction or in infotainment , indifference to the vision of human suffering gradually sets in . "
Research leader Antonio Damasio , director of USC's Brain and Creativity Institute , said the findings stressed the need for slower delivery of the news , and highlighted the importance of slow - burn emotions like admiration .
Damasio cited the example of U.S. President Barack Obama , who says he was inspired by his father , to show how admiration can be key to cultural success .
" We actually separate the good from the bad in great part thanks to the feeling of admiration .
It 's a deep physiological reaction that 's very important to define our humanity . "
Twitter , which allows users to swap messages and links of 140 - characters or less , says on its
Web site that it sees itself as a solution to information overload , rather than a cause of it .
This function ,
It says , " means you can step in and out of the flow of information as it suits you and it never queues up with increasing demand of your attention . "
Backing up data regularly should be one of the most important tasks of any computer user ; yet only a minority is doing it thoroughly and regularly .
The rest is flirting with disaster as there are numerous incidents that can delete data on computer systems .
The most common ones are hardware failures , which can mean damaged hard drives but also ( partially ) unreadable CDs or DVDs , computer virus attacks but also human error .
If you have ever met someone who partitioned the wrong hard drive you know that the latter can be cause for great frustration .
Backups are the single most effective method of preventing data loss on computer systems .

Where do superstitions come from ?
And could their origins be more logical than we think ?
Is it possible that the superstitious old neighbor of yours who runs off black cats and wails over broken mirrors is n't retarded ?
Let 's be honest , almost everybody is superstitious about something .
Maybe just a " lucky shirt " you wear to job interviews , or maybe you spent all weekend making sure that voodoo doll of your ex looked just right before ramming pins into its crotch .
5 Black Cats

Recently a whole stadium full of Cub fans held their breath when a cat raced onto the field during the game .
They let out a sigh of relief when they realized it was n't black ( and articles the next day were sure to mention its color ) .
After all , every Cub fan knows that a single visit by a black cat cursed the entire 1969 season .
Where the Hell Did This Come From ?
So how did something oh - so - cute and fluffy get associated with misfortune , death and witchcraft ?
Saints preserve us !
It 's a basket of Satan !
First of all , cats have always had a few habits that have a tendency freak people right out .
They like to seek sources of warmth ( sorry , Mister Fluffynuts does n't like sitting in your lap just because he loves you ) and have an odd fascination with examining human faces .
Often when a person passed away from fever or a baby died mysteriously in the night , they 'd find a cat perched on their chest or in the crib staring into their face , and the logical assumption was made that cats were harbingers of death that could suck the very life from your body .

I can has ur soul plz ?
It did n't help that a number of pre-Christian peoples such as the Norse , Celts and Egyptians had cat gods , or at least considered the animal sacred .
Once Christianity became the sexy new religion in town , old beliefs were branded witchcraft and cats found themselves guilty by association .
Often simply owning a cat was considered proof of witchery .
There was even widespread extermination of cats during medieval times , which kind of backfired when they were no longer around to kill plague - infested rats , which in turn wiped out half of Europe .
Whoops .
But hey , at least they were safe from those goddamn witches .

As for why black cats specifically were feared , well , you do n't need us to tell you that black has traditionally been associated with eeeevil .
There 's a reason Darth Vader did n't spend his time strutting around in a sporty magenta or mint green get - up .
I pictured what looked like a mushroom cap resting in the palm of an outstretched hand .
Then I covered my mouth and laughed so hard that beer trickled out of my nose .
I was just mopping it up when the last call was announced , and everyone raced to the counter to stock up .
Some of the drinkers would be at it until morning , when the bar reopened , while others would find their seats and sleep for a while before returning .
As for Johnny , he had a fifth of Smirnoff in his suitcase .
I had two Valiums in mine , and , because I have never much cared for sedatives , the decision to share them came easily .
An hour later , it was agreed that we needed to smoke some pot .
Each of us was holding , so the only question was where to smoke it **—** and how to get there from the bar .
Since taking the Valium , drinking six beers , and following them with straight vodka , walking had become a problem for me .
I do n’t know what it took to bring down Johnny , but he was n’t even close yet .
That ’s what comes with years of socking it away — you should be unconscious , but instead you ’re up and full of bright ideas .
“ I think I ’ve got a place we can go to , ” he said .
I ’m not sure why he chose the women ’s lounge rather than the men’s .
Perhaps it was closer , or maybe there was no men ’s lounge .
One way or the other , even now , almost twenty years later , it shames me to think of it .
The idea of holing up in a bathroom , of hogging the whole thing just so that you can hang out with someone who will never , under any circumstances , return your interest , makes me cringe .
Especially given that this — the “ dressing room ” it was called — was Amtrak ’s one meagre attempt to recapture some glamour .
It amounted to a small chamber with a window — a space not much bigger than a closet .
There was an area to sit while brushing your hair or applying makeup , and a mirror to look into while you did it .
A second , inner door led to a sink and toilet , but we kept that shut and installed ourselves on the carpeted floor .
Johnny had brought our plastic cups from the bar , and , after settling in , he poured us each a drink .
I felt boneless , as if I ’d been filleted ; yet still I managed to load the pipe and hold my lighter to the bowl .
Looking up through the window , I could see the moon , which struck me , in my half - conscious state , as flat and unnaturally bright , a sort of glowing Pringle .
“ Do you think we can turn that overhead light off ? ” I asked .
“ No problem , Chief . ”
It was he who brought up the subject of sex .
One moment , I was asking if his mom gave him a discount on his drugs , and the next thing I knew he was telling me about this woman he ’d recently had sex with .
“ A fatty , ” he called her .
“ A bloodsucker . ”
Johnny also told me that the older he got the harder it was to get it up .
“ I ’ll be totally into it , and then it ’s , like , ‘ What the fuck ? ’
You know ? ”
“ Oh , definitely . ”
He poured more vodka into his plastic cup and swirled it around , as if it were a fine cognac that needed to breathe .
“ You get into a lot of fights ? ” he asked .
“ Arguments ? ”
“ No , ” he said .
“ I mean with your fists .
You ever punch people ? ”
I relit the pipe and thought of the dustup my former boyfriend and I had had before I left .
It was the first time since the fifth grade that I ’d hit someone not directly related to me , and it left me feeling like a Grade A moron .
This had a lot to do with my punch , which was actually more of a slap .
To make it worse , I ’d then slipped on the icy sidewalk and fallen into a bank of soft gray snow .
There was no need to answer Johnny ’s fistfight question .
The subject had been raised for his benefit rather than mine , an excuse to bemoan the circumference of his biceps .
Back when he was boxing , the one on the right had measured seventeen and a half inches .
“ Now it ’s less than fourteen , ” he told me .
“ I ’m shrinking before my very fucking eyes . ”
“ Well , ca n’t you fatten it back up somehow ? ” I asked .
“ You ’re young .
I mean , just how hard can it be to gain weight ? ”
“ The problem is n’t gaining weight , it ’s gaining it in the right place , ” Johnny said .
“ Two six - packs a day might swell my stomach ** , ** but it ’s not doing shit for my arms . ”
“ Maybe you could lift the cans for a while before opening them , ” I offered .
“ That should count for something , should n’t it ? ”
Johnny flattened his voice .
“ You ’re a regular comedian , are n’t you ?
Keep it up and maybe you can open for that asshole in the bar . ”
A minute of silence and then he relit the pipe , took a hit , and passed it my way .
“ Look at us , ” he said , and he let out a long sigh .
“ A couple of first - class fucking losers . ”
I wanted to defend myself , or at least point out that we were in second class , but then somebody knocked on the door .
“ Go away , ” Johnny said .
“ The bathroom ’s closed until tomorrow . ” A minute later , there came another knock , this one harder , and before we could respond a key turned and a conductor entered .
It would n’t have worked to deny anything : the room stunk of pot and cigarette smoke .
There was the half - empty bottle of vodka , the plastic cups turned on their sides .
Put a couple of lampshades on our heads and the picture would have been complete .
I suppose that the conductor could have made some trouble — confiscated our dope , had us arrested at the next stop — but instead he just told us to take a hike , no easy feat on a train .
Johnny and I parted without saying good night , I staggering off to my seat , and he going , I assumed , to his .
I saw him again the following morning , back in the bar car .
Whatever spell had been cast the night before was broken , and he was just another alcoholic starting his day with a shot and a chaser .
As I ordered a coffee , the black man told a joke about a witch with one breast .
“ Give it a rest , ” the woman in the decorative sweatshirt said .
I smoked a few cigarettes and then returned to my seat , nursing what promised to be a two - day headache .
While slumped against the window , trying unsuccessfully to sleep , I thought of a trip to Greece I ’d taken in August of 1982 .
I was twenty - four that summer , and flew by myself from Raleigh to Athens .
A few days after arriving , I was joined by my father , my brother , and my older sister , Lisa .
The four of us travelled around the country , and when they went back to North Carolina I took a bus to the port city of Patras .
From there I sailed to Brindisi , Italy , wondering all the while why I had n’t returned with the rest of my family .
In theory it was wonderful — a European adventure .
I was too self - conscious to enjoy it , though , too timid , and it stymied me that I could n’t speak the language .
A bilingual stranger helped me buy a train ticket to Rome , but on the return to Brindisi I had no one but myself to rely on .
The man behind the counter offered me three options , and I guess I said yes to the one that meant “ No seat for me , thank you .
I would like to be packed as tightly as possible amongst people with no access to soap or running water . ”
It was a common request , at least among the young and foreign .
I heard French , Spanish , German , and a good many languages I could n’t quite identify .
What was it that sounded like English played backward ?
Dutch ?
Swedish ?
If I found the crowd intimidating , it had more to do with my insecurity than with the way anyone treated me .
I suppose the others seemed more deserving than I did , with their faded bandannas and goatskin bags sagging with wine .
While I was counting the days until I could go back home , they seemed to have a real talent for living .
When I was a young man , my hair was dark brown and a lot thicker than it is now .
I had one continuous eyebrow instead of two separate ones , and this made me look as if I sometimes rode a donkey .
It sounds odd to say it **— conceited , even — ** but I was cute that August when I was twenty - four .
I would n’t have said so at the time , but reviewing pictures taken by my father in Athens I think , That was me ?
Really ?
Looks - wise , that single month constituted my moment , a peak from which the descent was both swift and merciless .
It ’s only three hundred and fifty miles from Rome to Brindisi , but , what with the constant stopping and starting , the train took forever .
We left , I believe , at around 8:30 P.M. , and for the first few hours everyone stood .
Then we sat with our legs crossed , folding them in a little bit tighter when one person , and then another , decided to lie down .
As my fellow - passengers shifted position , I found myself pushed toward the corner , where I brushed up against a fellow named Bashir .
Lebanese , he said he was , en route to a small Italian university , where he planned to get a master ’s in engineering .
Bashir ’s English was excellent , and in a matter of minutes we formed what passes between wayfarers in a foreign country as a kind of automatic friendship .
More than a friendship , actually — a romance .
Coloring everything was this train , its steady rumble as we passed through the dark Italian countryside .
Bashir was — how to describe him ?
It was as if someone had coaxed the eyes out of Bambi and resettled them , half asleep , into a human face .
Nothing hard or ruined - looking there ; in fact , it was just the opposite — angelic , you might call him , pretty .
What was it that he and I talked about so intently ?
Perhaps the thrill was that we could talk , that our tongues , flabby from lack of exercise , could flap and make sounds in their old familiar way .
Three hours into our conversation , he invited me to get off the train in his college town and spend some time , as much as I liked , in the apartment that was waiting for him .
It was n’t the offer you ’d make to a backpacker but something closer to a proposal .
“ Be with me ” was the way I interpreted it .
At the end of our car was a little room , no more than a broom closet , really , with a barred window in it .
It must have been 4 A.M. when two dishevelled Germans stepped out , and we moved in to take their place .
As would later happen with Johnny Ryan , Bashir and I sat on the floor , the state of which clearly disgusted him .
Apart from the fact that we were sober and were pressed so close that our shoulders touched , the biggest difference was that our attraction was mutual .
The moment came when we should have kissed — you could practically hear the surging strings — but I was too shy to make the first move , and so , I guess , was he .
Still , I could feel this thing between us , not just lust but a kind of immediate love , the sort that , like instant oatmeal , can be realized in a matter of minutes and is just as nutritious as the real thing .
We ’ll kiss . . . now , I kept thinking .
Then , O.K. . . . now .
And on it went , more torturous by the second .
The sun was rising as we reached his destination , the houses and church spires of this strange city — a city I could make my own — silhouetted against the weak morning sky .
“ And so ? ” he asked .
I do n’t remember my excuse , but it all came down to cowardice .
For what , really , did I have to return to ?
A job pushing a wheelbarrow on Raleigh construction sites ?
A dumpy one - bedroom next to the IHOP ?
Bashir got off with his three big suitcases and became a perennial lump in my throat , one that rises whenever I hear the word “ Lebanon ” or see its jittery outline on the evening news .
Is that where you went back to ?
I wonder .
Do you ever think of me ?
Are you even still alive ?
Given the short amount of time we spent together , it ’s silly how often , and how tenderly , I think of him .
All the way to Penn Station , hung over from my night with Johnny Ryan , I wondered what might have happened had I taken Bashir up on his offer .
I imagined our apartment overlooking a square : the burbling fountain , the drawings of dams and bridges piled neatly on the desk .
When you ’re young , it ’s easy to believe that such an opportunity will come again , maybe even a better one .
Instead of a Lebanese guy in Italy , it might be a Nigerian one in Belgium , or maybe a Pole in Turkey .
You tell yourself that if you travelled alone to Europe this summer you could surely do the same thing next year and the year after that .
Of course , you do n’t , though , and the next thing you know you ’re an aging , unemployed elf , so desperate for love that you spend your evening mooning over a straight alcoholic .
The closer we got to New York the more miserable I became .
Then I thought of this guy my friend Lili and I had borrowed a ladder from a few months earlier , someone named Hugh .
I ’d never really trusted people who went directly from one relationship to the next , so after my train pulled into Penn Station , and after I ’d taken the subway home , I ’d wait a few hours , or maybe even a full day , before dialling his number and asking if he ’d like to hear a joke . ♦

International targets will not be met by 2010 .
Less than 10 % of the world 's forests are protected .
Wikimedia / S. Doronenko
Sufficient efforts are not being made to protect 10 % of the world 's forests by 2010 — as agreed under the Convention on Biological Diversity ( CBD ) — according to a new analysis1 .
The study is the first attempt to work out how much of the globe 's 20 major types of forest are safeguarded .
It shows that only 7.7 % are currently protected according to categories established by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) , headquartered in Gland , Switzerland .
The work is based on the United Nations ' Food and Agriculture Organization 's definition of a forest — that is , an area of land more than 0.5 hectares in size with more than 10 % canopy cover .
" According to our analysis , the CBD targets will not be met , " says Neil Burgess , a conservation scientist at the University of Cambridge , UK , and one of the study 's authors .
The CBD target of 10 % was agreed by 191 countries — excluding the United States — in 2004 .
Although 7.7 % is " reasonably good " , Burgess says , CBD signatories agreed to 10 % " because it was thought this level of protection was necessary for biodiversity conservation " .
He says that it is now recognized that protecting forests is also important for efforts to stabilize climate change , " so if we are failing to meet the target it could be even worse for climate stabilization than for biodiversity " .
A varied picture
The study found that the level of protection offered to different forest types varied greatly , ranging from a low of just 3.2 % for the world 's temperate freshwater swamp forests to a high of 28 % for temperate broadleaf evergreen forests .
The analysis also looked at the level of protection afforded to forests in the world 's 825 ecoregions , defined by the conservation group WWF as areas containing geographically distinct groups of natural communities that share many of their species and similar environmental conditions , and interact ecologically in ways that are important for their long - term survival .
The authors also include the 34 ' biodiversity hotspots ' identified by Conservation International ( CI ) , a non-governmental organization based in Arlington , Virginia .
Breaking down the forest types into ecoregions is useful because " the rainforests in Brazil contain different species from those in the Congo " , says Burgess .
“ According to our analysis , the CBD targets will not be met . ” Neil Burgess
University of Cambridge
The study found that 65 % of the ecoregions have less than 10 % of their forests protected .
The highest level of protection — with more than 50 % of forest protected — was found in ecoregions in parts of the Amazon , southeast Asia and Alaska .
The team also established that , on average , 10.2 % of the forests in areas designated as biodiversity hotspots by the CI were protected .
But some areas were better protected than others — for example , about 7 % of the Guinean forests of West Africa are protected , whereas 17.7 % of the forests in the mountains of Central Asia are protected .
Burgess says it is " good news " that many of the most important areas for biodiversity are being protected at a level above the 10 % target .
Meaningful target ?
The group used data from an existing map , published in 2000 , of global forest cover from the United Nations Environment Programme 's World Conservation Monitoring Centre in Cambridge , UK .
The researchers updated this map using satellite data collected in 2005 .

John Healy , a forest ecologist at the University of Wales , Bangor , says that the study is important because it looks at forest protection in ecoregions and by forest type , rather than just total forest cover .
" They have carried out the study in a far more biogeographically and ecologically meaningful way [ than previous studies ] " , he says .
But , he adds , " The reality is we do n't know whether the protection status is being enforced on the ground . "
Lauren Coad , a forest scientist at the Environmental Change Institute , University of Oxford , UK , and another of the paper 's authors , says that the 10 % target is " arbitrary but politically important " .
" People need a target to focus , " she says .
" It can galvanize them into action . "
We ’ve just had the press release in from EA .
Seems like Bad Company 2 is coming , but Battlefield 1943 is coming first – two games in one PR ?
Madness .
DICE today announced the development of Battlefield : Bad Company 2 , the sequel to last year ’s blockbuster title .

Wake Island , Guadalcanal and Iwo Jima .
Delivering the award - winning through - the - gun and vehicle warfare online experience DICE is best recognized for , Battlefield 1943 will have players battling in ruthless aerial dog fights and intense trench combat .
“ Bad Company 2 takes everything that players liked in the original and ups the ante – more vehicles , more destruction and more team play , ” said Karl Magnus Troedsson , Executive Producer Battlefield Franchise , DICE .
“ Battlefield 1943 is a new take on a blast from the past classic coming to life with brand new technology that we ’re eager to get into players hands . ”
Increasing ice in Antarctica is not a sign that the earth is actually cooling instead of warming as some climate change - skeptics have attested .
A new study finds that the growth in Antarctic ice during the last 30 years is actually due to shifting weather patterns caused by the hole in the ozone layer .
The researchers predict that eventually global warming will catch up to Antarctica leading to overall melting as it has in the Arctic .
“ Our results show the complexity of climate change across the Earth .
While there is increasing evidence that the loss of sea ice in the Arctic has occurred due to human activity , in the Antarctic human influence through the ozone hole has had the reverse effect and resulted in more ice , ” says lead author John Turner from the British Antarctic Survey ( BAS ) .
“ Although the ozone hole is in many ways holding back the effects of greenhouse gas increases on the Antarctic , this will not last , as we expect ozone levels to recover by the end of the 21st Century .
By then there is likely to be around one third less Antarctic sea ice . ”
Published in Geophysical Research Letter the study by scientists from NASA and BAS found that the hole in the ozone layer strengthened surface winds in Antarctica while deepening storms in the South Pacific , leading to more cold air over West Antarctica which in turn has caused the increase in ice production .
Satellites have revealed that ice loss and production in Antarctica is highly variable , with some regions experiencing warming and loss of ice while other regions the opposite due to the ozone hole .
Since the 1970s satellite images have shown that Antarctic ice has increased about 100,000 square kilometers ( 62,100 square miles ) per decade .
The researchers say this increase is not very great , about 0.97 percent per decade .
“ Understanding how polar sea ice responds to global change – whether human induced or as part of a natural process – is really important if we are to make accurate predictions about the Earth ’s future climate , ” Turner adds .
“ This new research helps us solve some of the puzzle of why sea-ice is shrinking is some areas and growing in others . ”

After cleaning up some of the newer applications I linked into the corporation chat and it was nice to see over 20 corp members and another 6 in our semi-public chat channels .
Immediately , I was bombarded by fleet invitations .
" Guys , guys - what is going on ? " I asked .
" Carrier outside a POS shield .
I need a webber here asap ! " Replied RoninData , obviously doing his ninja - type skulking around .
" We need a remote repping battle ship fleet NOW . "
Demanded Hera as he busily got himself ready .
" Get a fleet up .
All pilots , acknowledge . " " RoninData , ready .
" " Randgris , ready . " " Jax , ready . " " 3 Jayne , ready . " " Pix , ready . "
In all , the fleet had seventeen pilots and within two minutes , the rag - tag fleet raced to Helgatid in a near approximation to a remote armour repair gang as could be done in the time limit available .
Gorgoleon was the first battle ship to arrive and double - webbed and pointed the chimera class carrier .
I was next but had no point , instead I was concentrating on repairing the armour on my fellow fleet mates .
The chimera was slowed to a crawl but then fighters and drones were launched , screaming into space .
The POS had two gunners who controlled the plethora of guns , webbers , neutralisers , scramblers and missile batteries to keep us busy .
" Bump him .
Bump him ! "
Shouted Hera , taking lead as the larger ships attempted to get into position .
We knew that the chimera had an immense shield tank and only by attacking the capacitor supply would we be triumphant .
However , most of the cap was being used to power our remote repairers and energy transfers .
It was a fine balance and we were found wanting .
The chimera pilot was slowly crawling , like a glacier towards the safety of his POS shields .
More corp members logged on and were pulled in to assist .
Silv came in , twice with his hauler with much needed cap boosters before a gate camp prevented his third trip .
Silv informed us that in the neighbouring system , Electus Matari were camping the gates and their numbers had been going up since we had tackled the chimera .
They had not yet made their move but it was n't clear if they were friendly to the chimera pilot or not .
However , our DPS was too low to worry the carrier , initially .
The chimera was smart bombing our main source of DPS , the drones from the two dominix class ships .
We needed dreads or our own carriers but we did n't have any available .
All we could do was to keep the chimera webbed and occupied long enough to think of something else .
Meanwhile , the POS operators cycled their webbers , neutralisers and ECM on all of us .
" Randgris needs armour . " " Maltrox needs cap . " " Gorg needs armour and cap .
" So it went on for a good fifteen minutes .
Silv 's timely appearance in his hauler allowed us to keep up the pressure but we needed more energy neutralisers and / or damage .
We desperately called out for more help .
If the POS was unmanned - it would have been easier but the POS gunners did an effective job on us .
At times , we had our ships warping out to repair and or jammed into ineffectiveness .
Our logistics cruiser was almost 100 % jammed or neutralised to the point of uselessness .
Finally , our frantic calls for assistance was answered with Herdzo coming in with his carrier and we even pulled in a complete neutral - not even an alt of any of the pilots ; who brought in his thanatos to assist .
With a carrier full of cap boosters we could finally get on top of the fight .
Our own fleet fighters screamed out and all our heavy neutralisers could be permanently run .
The Chimera 's shield shrank very quickly and once it had dropped below 10 % , it was good night and pack up your stuff .
Meanwhile , the number of reds next door continued to rise - they already outnumbered us and we were getting a bit nervous .
However , our ships started to align as the chimera began to drop into structure .
" Contact .
Contact .
Contact . "
Said someone in fleet - the Electus Matari fleet , finally arrived and dropped six carriers on us .
Their long period of sitting in the next system ( almost 30 minutes ) was probably them organising their own capital ships .
They were too late to save the chimera ( if indeed they were ) and most of the The Bastards got out ; we lost a dominix battle ship in the ensuing scramble .
The neutral carrier was warp scrambled by the POS tower and was doomed .
I do n't even know the name of the thanatos pilot at the time ( found out it is Maruk Ihnati ) but we thank him from the bottom of our ( black ) hearts for his assistance .
After the fight , we chatted to him and he sounded mellow and calm .
He was n't too bothered and was looking forward to a new carrier .
I do n't think it was even insured ... Great job on the work , considering that The Bastards had mothballed their remote repping fleet setups during the run up to the alliance tourney , we did okay .
Need more damage and better organisation but it was good nonetheless .

As anticipated , the California State Supreme Court ruled to uphold prop 8 , the same - sex marriage ban .
That means that gay marriage in the state of California is still considered illegal , effectively stripping away civil rights of many GLBT Californians .
The State Supreme court ruled that prop 8 is legal in a 6 - 1 ruling with justice Marino being the sole holdout .
Alas .
The 18,000 same - sex marriages , however , will remain legal , effectively creating two classes of people in the gay community , those who are married and those who are not .

State : Film on Waco tragedy messes with Texas ' image Texas balks at Hollywood take on Waco tragedy

Movie producer Emilio Ferrari vowed last week to move ahead with his $ 30 million screen depiction of the deadly 1993 clash between federal agents and Branch Davidian cultists , even though the Texas Film Commission says the project could taint Texas ’ image and is unworthy of taxpayer support .
The movie , Waco , would be the first feature - film treatment of the 51 - day federal siege of David Koresh ’s Central Texas compound that led to the death of four federal agents and more than 80 cult members .
Ferrari , whose production credits include Baby on Board , starring Heather Graham , called the incident the “ nation ’s biggest tragedy , after 9/11 . ”
“ And this was by Americans against Americans , ” he said .
“ It ’s been completely swept under the rug .
I think people have a right to know what happened .
I ’m not a political guy at all .
I ’m making a story from every point of view . ”
The Texas Film Commission ’s director , Bob Hudgins , said the movie would not be eligible for a state rebate of up to 15 percent on in - state production costs because the movie does n’t “ accurately portray Texans . ”
In language creating the stipend , lawmakers specified that Film Commission grants should be denied movies that distort facts to make Texas look bad .
Hudgins said he consulted media and law enforcement sources and determined that the movie ’s script compresses and simplifies the historic event .
Actions that were taken by several individuals during the standoff are attributed to a single character in the movie , he said .
Dispute over facts
The extent of a movie ’s factual distortion is n’t a factor in determining its eligibility for funding , Hudgins said .
“ Either it is ( accurate ) , or it is n’t , ” he said .
“ Show me where in the script there is anything against Texas , ” Ferrari said .
“ Those are his two points :
It ’s against Texans , and it ’s inaccurate .
Neither is correct . ”
Among production staff , he said , is Mike McNulty , who co-wrote the 1997 Oscar - nominated documentary , Waco : The Rules of Engagement .
“ Thousands of hours of research went into this project , ” Ferrari said .
“ Every expert on Waco worked for me . ”
Hudgins ’ decision , Ferrari said , “ affects my credibility and the credibility of everyone involved . ”
The producer said he had planned to begin filming the movie near Houston in August .
Now , he said , he is scouting for a new location , but — if the state would modify its stance — he still would like to film in the Lone Star State .
“ The movie should be filmed in Texas , where it actually happened , ” Ferrari said .
Other exemptions
Hudgins said Ferrari ’s movie , though not eligible for the production rebate , still could receive assorted tax exemptions granted in - state movie , television , commercial or video game productions .
Hudgins said Ferrari and his associates never formally applied for the production rebate , but if they had , the application would have been rejected .
Then - Gov. Preston Smith created the Texas Film Commission in 1971 , but money for in - state productions was not provided until 2007 .
Since then , one movie and two television series have received grants .
Most Texas productions are commercials , Hudgins said .
The Branch Davidian standoff began on Feb. 28 , 1993 , when federal agents attempted to serve search and arrest warrants at the group ’s Waco - area compound .
It concluded in a disastrous fire on April 19 as authorities fired gas canisters into the compound .

The prototype of Nissan 's forthcoming electric car may look like a breadbox , but the technology beneath that boxy body could propel the Japanese automaker to the front of the EV pack when the car hits the road next year .
Nissan may be a small player compared to the likes of General Motors , Toyota and Honda , but it 's probably the most committed to EVs .
CEO Carlos Ghosn has said in no uncertain terms that cars with cords are the future of the automobile .
And he 's backed that up with an all - in bet on a practical , affordable hatchback with decent range , reasonable recharge time and room for five people .
Oh - and Nissan says it 'll cost about 90 cents to charge .
" It 's a real car with 100 - mile range , " said Mark Perry , Nissan 's director of product planning .
" We may not be the first to market with an EV , but we 'll be the first to mass - market an EV . "
Forget hydrogen and ethanol .
Electricity is the next big thing in cars .
Just about everyone has jumped on the EV bandwagon , and most of the major automakers promise to have one on the road between 2010 and 2012 .
General Motors has garnered the most attention for the Chevrolet Volt , a range - extended EV we 'll see by the end of 2010 .
But GM is hardly alone .
BMW is deploying a test fleet of electric Minis .
Daimler is working on an electric Smart city car .
Tesla Motors recently unveiled its gorgeous sedan .
Ford is working on an electric car based on the Fusion or Fiesta , and even Chrysler is getting in on the act with cars we might see in a year or two if it 's still in business .
Every one of them could end up following Nissan to the party .
" Nissan could end up being the come - from - behind leader in the EV space because Carlos Ghosn has pushed them so aggressively , " said Darryl Siry , an electric car expert and clean tech analyst at Peppercom .
" Nissan is making moves that could make it the major mass - market EV
player among the established automakers . "
Nissan brought the prototype to San Francisco and let us take it for a spin .
The car we 'll see in showrooms by the end of 2010 wo n't look like the prototype , which is a Cube city car fitted with an electric motor and lithium - ion battery pack .
The as - yet - unnamed car slated for production will be a five - door hatchback based on a " heavily modified " Versa chassis .
Perry would n't give us any hints about what the production model will look like , but he promised it will be distinctive — yet restrained .
" We want it to be iconic , " he said .
" We want people to look at it and know it 's an EV .
But we want it to be a real car .
It ca n't be strange . "
Our test drive was limited to a half - mile loop around a big parking lot near San Francisco Bay , so we can't offer a definitive assessment .
But we can tell you the drivetrain offered brisk acceleration — a hallmark of electric motors , which offer great torque — and the car felt nimble .
Everything about it felt like we 'd just driven it off the showroom floor .
" The performance is 99 percent there , " Perry said of drivetrain development .
" This is essentially what we 're going to launch with . "
And though the electro - Cube we tooled around in was relatively spartan , Perry says the production model will be top - shelf .
" We 're building this car for consumers , " he said .
" It will have navi .
It will have stereo .
It will have A/C and power seats .
All the things you want and expect will be in this car . "
The car will use a lithium - ion battery pack that Perry says will recharge in four hours if you plug it into a 220 volt socket — the same kind your washer and drier are plugged into .
Plug it into a 110 and you 're looking at 14 hours .
If you 've got a 440 volt line — and Perry says many businesses do — you can get an 80 percent charge in just 26 minutes .
Perry would n't say anything at all about the car 's specs , but Siry said the 100 - mile range suggests the car will have a 20 - kilowatt battery .
As for those recharge times , Siry said , " all those numbers make sense .
They 're about right . "
So what 's it gonna cost ?
Perry would n't give us a specific figure but said it will be comparable to Nissan 's family sedans .
For what it 's worth , the Altima starts at about $ 20,000 and the Maxima starts at $ 30,000 .
And the EV will qualify for the $ 7,500 federal tax credit .
Perry said the EV wo n't carry the price premium often found on hybrids because Nissan wants to make it as affordable as possible .
" We 're going for volume , " he said .
" We 're targeting the mass market and mass sales . "
What kind of volume ?
Perry said the goal is an initial run of as many as 10,000 cars when the car goes on sale in 15 markets — including the San Francisco Bay Area ; Portland , Oregon ; Tucson , Arizona ; San Diego and elsewhere — nationwide by the end of 2010 .
The first cars will be offered to fleets , but Perry said they 'll be available to the public if there 's a demand for them .
Production will ramp up from there , with worldwide sales by 2012 .
Perry says the forthcoming EV will be part of a " portfolio " of electric cars Nissan will offer in the years to come .
All of those cars will need somewhere to plug in when they are n't in driveways , so Nissan is working with utility companies and local , state and national governments ( United States , Japan , Israel and several European countries ) to develop public charging infrastructure .
As for what the car will cost to operate , Perry says the cost per mile cost is 4 cents if you figure gas is four bucks a gallon , electricity is 14 cents a kilowatt hour and you drive 15,000 miles a year .
Compare that to the 13 cents a mile you 'll pay in a car that gets 30 mpg .
Perry says the car will cost about 90 cents to charge if you plug it in off - peak .
" The math works even if gas goes down to $ 1.10 a gallon , " he said .
" But I do n't expect gas to go down to $ 1.10 a gallon . "
UPDATE April 3 : As readers have noted , we neglected to mention the work Better Place is doing in Israel , Denmark , Hawaii and elsewhere to create a network of public charging and battery exchange stations .
There 's much more information about Better Place in the Wired cover story " Driven : Shai Agassi 's Audacious Plan to Put Electric Cars on the Road . "

( CNN ) --
The chase began with a stolen plane from a Canadian flight school , meandered through three states with U.S. fighter jets hot on the trail and forced the evacuation of the state Capitol in Wisconsin .
Yavuz Berke is being held in the U.S. after allegedly stealing a plane from a Canadian flight school .
It ended about seven hours later in a Midwestern town of 360 people inside a general store off a narrow dirt road -- with the suspect sipping on a Gatorade , waiting to be cuffed .
" He just came in , got a Gatorade , tried to get a beef jerky , did n't have enough money , went over and sat down and just kind of watched people come and go , " said Tammy Bailey of Simmons Grocery & Hardware in Ellsinore in southern Missouri .
Authorities said there , they caught up with the man -- identified by U.S. immigration officials as Yavuz Berke , also known as Adam Dylan Leon -- after his 783 - mile journey in the stolen Cessna 172 aircraft Monday .
Berke , who authorities said is a Turkish - born Canadian citizen , was in the custody of U.S. immigration officials Tuesday on suspicion of illegally entering the United States , according to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency .

The plane was reported taken from a flight school in Thunder Bay , Ontario , about 3 p.m.
Monday by a pilot identified as a student at the school , said Laura Brown of the Federal Aviation Administration .
It flew over Lake Superior less than half an hour later .
Do n't Miss Pilot of plane captured after fleeing on foot
F - 16 fighter jets , which intercepted the plane near Michigan 's Upper Peninsula border with Wisconsin , tried repeatedly to draw the pilot 's attention .
At one point , the pilot appeared to acknowledge that he saw the other planes , said Mike Kucharek , a spokesman with the North American Aerospace Defense Command .
" He looked at them , " Kucharek said .
But the man did not communicate with either NORAD or with the FAA , officials said .
Instead , the plane flew " erratically " during the afternoon , Kucharek said , sometimes reaching 14,000 feet in altitude , then dropping as low as 3,000 feet .
" We do n't want to suppose the motive of the individual , " Kucharek said .
" But it certainly made a day for the professional pilots that were flying these missions and a very serious situation from a NORAD perspective . "
During the pursuit , Wisconsin evacuated the Capitol in Madison for less than an hour as a precaution .
The Wisconsin National Guard deployed two F - 16s to try to get the pilot to communicate with FAA air traffic controllers .

Eventually , the man landed the four - seater plane on a road in southern Missouri , parking it under what appeared to be a bridge or culvert -- apparently to hide it , a federal law enforcement source said .
The plane -- which had been fully fueled , giving it about seven hours of flying time -- was down to roughly 30 minutes of fuel , said Lt. Cmdr. Gary Ross of NORAD .
The pilot ran from the scene , prompting a brief manhunt .
The search led authorities to Simmons Grocery & Hardware , where they found their suspect .
" They walked over and asked him a few questions , " said Bailey , the store employee .
" The guy stood up , turned around .
They handcuffed him , stood there , talked to him a little bit and took him off . "

No , your eyes do not deceive you .
Every Wednesday schoolgirls of this school in Beijing should wash windows of the classes outside .
The school management says , that thus brings up at children bravery .
The news from Europe , if you listen to our infatuated media , is that the Euros love President Obama : according to the American reportage , his recent trip there was a cavalcade of photo - ops , cheering crowds , and hugs from the queen of England .
Even the French were in awe of him !
However , if you look beneath the surface , not that far beneath the gloss and the glam there runs a current of irritation , and , dare I say it , resentment .
Take , for example , his stop in the Czech Republic , where he declared that he was seeking a nuclear - free world – that is , a world free of nuclear weapons .
This is a goal the United States has a special moral responsibility to seek , he averred , because we are the only nation that has actually used these weapons .
The crowd loved it .
What they did n’t at all love , however , was his announcement that
“ ‘As long as the threat from Iran persists , we will go forward with a missile defense system that is cost - effective and proven .
Iran ’s nuclear and ballistic missile activity poses a real threat , not just to the United States , but to Iran ’s neighbors and our allies . ' ”
" The governments of the Czech Republic and Poland , he added , are ‘ courageous ’ for ‘ agreeing to host a defense against these missiles . ’ "
One supposes it takes a fair amount of courage to defy the wishes of your own people and obey the dictates of a foreign power , albeit not the sort of courage appreciated by Obama ’s audience .
As the London Telegraph put it :
" The crowd enthusiastically cheered the more idealistic parts of Mr. Obama ’s speech but was relatively subdued when he spoke about his backing for missile defense .
" Petr Sramek , 33 , was among those disappointed that Mr. Obama had not dropped a policy that was opposed by more than two thirds of Czechs .
‘ I really liked the clear message on nuclear disarmament but I am against the missile defense system .
It is more about geopolitical influence then defense against missiles . ’
" Arena Protivinska , 30 , described herself as a ‘ big fan ’ of Mr. Obama but accused him of ‘ hypocrisy ’ for urging world peace while also pushing forward with the missile shield .
‘ He sounded like George W Bush saying that we should be afraid in order to justify missile defense . ’ "
Like Americans , the Europeans want to believe – but they see the two faces of Barack Obama too clearly , and the contrast is too apparent to be denied .
The gullible Americans , who take things at face value , still believe their new president represents a real change , a challenge to the status quo , while the more sophisticated Europeans are quick to pick up on Obama ’s inconsistencies – made all the more glaring by his habit of pairing two mutually contradictory stances on the same issue .
This includes not only coupling missile " defense " in Eastern Europe with the prospect of a nuclear - free world , but also the recent launching of his " Af - Pak " initiative .
Although dressed up as a diplomatic offensive , this is essentially a military offensive aimed at widening the war in Afghanistan to include portions of Pakistan .
The administration and its media lapdogs portrayed the Af - Pak rollout as a definitive break with the bad old days of the Bush White House , when it was all about troop movements .
The new regime , we ’re told , will initiate substantial diplomatic and humanitarian aid efforts , notably an effort to reach out to dissident elements of the Taliban .
However , the real core of the Af - Pak strategy is a radical escalation of the military element , in effect an Afghan " surge " spilling over into Pakistan ’s tribal areas : it means the addition of some 21,000 soldiers to U.S. forces , with the prospect of more to come .
The Janus - faced American hegemon speaks out of both sides of his mouth , and in two voices : one for the masses , who delight in his soaring idealism and seeming ability to express their deepest aspirations , and one for the elites , who hear a promise of continuity rather than change .
This two - track narrative framed even his Prague declamation of a nuclear - free world .
According to a top White House aide , we are not to take this idea all that seriously :
" Gary Samore , a White House adviser on arms control , indicated that Mr. Obama ’s call for ridding the world of nuclear weapons should not be taken too literally .
‘ In terms of a nuclear - free world , we recognize this is not a near - term possibility , ’ he said .
Rather , the call was an attempt to ‘ seize the moral high ground ’ in order to increase pressure on countries such as North Korea and Iran . "
Obama giveth with one hand , and taketh away with another – smiling that oil - slick grin the whole time .
Although I agree with the sentiments of the Czech woman cited above , the Obama method goes way beyond mere hypocrisy .
It is a conscious technique of inverting the true meaning and intent of his policies .
Thus , his launching of an intensified military campaign in Central Asia is portrayed as an effort to " stabilize " the region .
His provocation against Russia in Eastern Europe is paired with a call to abolish nuclear weapons .
And , of course , this ploy carries over into the domestic arena , as well , where – in the process of giving certain favored sectors of the financial industry trillions in subsidies – he has launched a campaign against " corporate greed " and outrageously extravagant executive salaries and perks .
He rails against corporate irresponsibility , yet he has appointed to his administration the very corporate insiders who got us into this mess in the first place .
Obama ran for president as the spokesman for the underdog – the little guy just managing to make ends meet , whose volunteerism and contributions over the Internet catapulted the Illinois senator into the running .
Yet the reality is that Obama was corporate America ’s candidate from the very beginning , and they showed it by lavishly financing his campaign : the money emanating from Goldman Sachs was quite impressive , and , together with the DNC , Wall Street buried the Republicans , who were outspent by three - to - one [ . pdf ] ( and out of gas in any event ) .
Unsurprisingly , the top echelons of the president ’s economic team are filled with former Goldman Sachs officials – and , not coincidentally , that firm is the primary beneficiary of the AIG / bank bailout .
The ruling elites of this country , confronted by the specter of a rising populist anger , have found in President Obama a subtle and skillful anger - management expert .
For years they ’ve been frustrated in Washington , as their efforts to fight a spreading war met increasing resistance from the American people .
Divine Providence smiled down on them , however , as Obama suddenly appeared out of nowhere .
Here was an " antiwar " candidate who said we ’ve been fighting the wrong war all along – and , upon taking office , immediately rectified that by sending 21,000 more troops to the wilds of Central Asia .
What a godsend to the War Party Barack Obama is !
As he moves toward confrontations with Iran , Russia , and Pakistan , and continues to unnecessarily irritate China , Asia ’s sleeping giant , the media portray him as the Great Peacemaker .
As the mask slips , however , and the reality becomes all too apparent , how will his " progressive " supporters react ?
Will they rise in protest , or sign on to Obama ’s war ?
Stay tuned to this space for the answer …

BBC Persian correspondents ( or just people being interviewed , I 'm not sure ) talking live from Paris ( left ) and Glasgow , Scotland ( right ) .
It seems like everyone ’s watching BBC Persian television these days , with the station ’s programs quickly replacing the long - held “ most popular ” standing of VOA Persian television among other satellite TV stations .
Authorities in Tehran have reacted shrilly to the appearance of a news source that can reach an Iranian audience , but which they themselves cannot directly control .
Some Iranian officials have termed BBC Persian as an " illegal " channel , and have publicly stated that they will do their utmost to keep its programming from reaching an Iranian audience .
Any Iranian inside Iran caught contributing to BBC Persian broadcasts will be punished , and the BBC journalists working for the English - language service in Tehran will be closely monitored , officials have cautioned .
A survey of the Persian - language blogosphere shows that the BBC Persian channel is stoking a lock of chatter .
A blogger posting on the Modakhele site commented that the BBC Persian service had aroused the ire of the Iranian leadership precisely because of its effectiveness in presenting a different point of view , other than the officially endorsed one .
Another blogger , identified as Arash , predicted that BBC Persian would soon capture a commanding market share .
" The quality of BBC Persian TV ’s programs was excellent and beyond my expectations .
I am sure that soon it will gain a special standing in Iran , " the blogger wrote .
" It is run very professionally and proficiently .
. . .
It is much more proficient than the VOA . "
Various statistics suggest that up to 60 percent of Iran ’s roughly 70 million population would have relatively easy access to BBC Persian ’s satellite broadcasts .
At present , the leading foreign broadcaster in Farsi is Voice of America ( VOA ) TV .
Iranian political experts say VOA TV ’s flaws are giving BBC Persian a chance to fast inroads ...
More than an hour after Khatami ’s announcement , Iran ’s state - run television channels had yet to mention it ; 30 minutes further on , Channel 2 gave it a few seconds at the end of its newscast .

I 'm a big fan myself , and now BBC Persian is the first place I go when I want to hear the language .
Apparently it's also a big success in Iran , where :
That 's no surprise - the production quality alone and the fact that it broadcasts for 8 hours a day , seven days a week makes it pretty addictive .
As written before , the government in Iran is not all that happy about a broadcaster broadcasting in their language but without being influenced by them at all :
One concrete example of a reason why a quality broadcaster like BBC in the Persian language is so important can be seen in this article .
Mohammad Khatami announced yesterday that he would be running for president again .
So how much attention was this given in the media inside Iran ?
Well :
On BBC Persian however , this news was at the top of the program as soon as he made the announcement .
If you want to see what BBC Persian looks like , just go here .

Last week ,
The Times reported that the nation ’s intelligence agencies have been collecting private e-mail messages and phone calls of Americans on a scale that went beyond the broad limits established in legislation last year .
The article quoted the Justice Department as saying there had been problems in the surveillance program that had been resolved .
But Justice did not say what those problems were or what the resolution was .
That is the heart of the matter : nobody really knows what any of the rules were .
Mr. Bush never offered the slightest explanation of what he found lacking in the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act when he decided to ignore the law after 9/11 and ordered the warrantless wiretapping of Americans ’ overseas calls and e-mail .
He said he was president and could do what he wanted .
The Bush administration also never explained how it interpreted laws that were later passed to expand the government ’s powers to eavesdrop .
And the Obama administration argued in a recent court filing that everything associated with electronic eavesdropping , including what is allowed and what is not , is a state secret .
We do not think Mr. Obama will violate Americans ’ rights as Mr. Bush did .
But if Americans do not know the rules , they cannot judge whether this government or any one that follows is abiding by the rules .
In the case of detainee abuse , Mr. Obama assured C.I.A. operatives that they would not be prosecuted for actions that their superiors told them were legal .
We have never been comfortable with the “ only following orders ” excuse , especially because Americans still do not know what was actually done or who was giving the orders .
After all , as far as Mr. Bush ’s lawyers were concerned , it was not really torture unless it involved breaking bones , burning flesh or pulling teeth .
That , Mr. Bybee kept noting , was what the Libyan secret police did to one prisoner .
The standard for American behavior should be a lot higher than that of the Libyan secret police .
At least Mr. Obama is not following Mr. Bush ’s example of showy trials for the small fry  like Lynndie England of Abu Ghraib notoriety .
But he has an obligation to pursue what is clear evidence of a government policy sanctioning the torture and abuse of prisoners  in violation of international law and the Constitution .
Credit - rating agency Moody ’s downgraded Berkshire Hathaway two notches , said Andrew Ross Sorkin in The New York Times , spoiling its perfect Aaa rating and “ tarnishing the luster ” of Warren Buffett ’s chief investment vehicle .
Berkshire for years held a “ rarefied status ” among U.S. firms , due to Buffett ’s legendary “ investing prowess , ” but even the best companies are hit in a recession like this .
“ In an interesting twist , Berkshire owns 20 percent of Moody’s . ”
That ’s why the downgrade is “ the PR move of the decade , ” said Peter Cohan in BloggingStocks .
It gives a patina of independence and objectivity to a rating agency that , with its brethren Standard & Poor ’s and Fitch , “ gorged on fees from investment banks ” to over - rate their “ toxic waste . ”
Moody ’s would have more credibility if it had " downgraded Berkshire before Berkshire ’s shares lost 44 percent of their value . ”
“ Moody ’s appears to be a bit late to the party , ” said Ravi Nagarajan in Guru Focus .
Fitch beat them to Berkshire a month ago , albeit with a less “ harsh ” downgrade .
On its merits , though , Moody ’s downgrade appears to be based on “ dubious logic . ”
Rather than assessing the risk of a default , the tarnished rating agencies seem to be “ desperately ” trying to assert their own relevance .

[ Introduction to The Privatization of Roads and Highways .
Walter Block writes , " This book is dedicated to my fellow Americans , some 40,000 of them per year who have died needlessly in traffic fatalities .
It is my sincere hope and expectation that under a system of private roads and highways in the future , that this number may be radically reduced . " ]
I advocate the complete , total , and full privatization of all roads , streets , highways , byways , avenues , and other vehicular thoroughfares .
And I am serious about this , deadly serious .
This is so far off the radar of public - policy analysis and apart from the concerns of politicians , pundits , and commentators that few people will take it seriously .
Do not be one of them .
Your very life may be at stake .
For over 40,000 people die on the nation 's roadways every year , and you or a loved one might one day join this horrid list .
Do not be misled by the oft - made contention that the actual cause of highway fatalities is speed , drunkenness , vehicle malfunction , driver error , etc .
These are only proximate causes .
The ultimate cause of our dying like flies in traffic accidents is that those who own and manage these assets supposedly in the name of the public — the various roads bureaucrats — cannot manage their way out of the proverbial paper bag .
It is they and they alone who are responsible for this carnage .
This does not mean that , were thoroughfares placed in private hands , the death toll would be zero .
It would not .
But , at least , every time the life of someone was tragically snuffed out , someone in a position to ameliorate these dangerous conditions would lose money , and this tends , wonderfully , to focus the minds of the owners .
This is why we do not have similar problems with bananas , baskets , and bicycles , or the myriad other goods and services supplied to us by a ( relatively ) free - enterprise system .
If the highways were now commercial ventures , as once in our history they were , and upward of 40,000 people were killed on them annually , you can bet your bottom dollar that Ted Kennedy and his ilk would be holding Senate hearings on the matter .
Blamed would be " capitalism , " " markets , " " greed , " i.e. , the usual suspects .
But it is the public authorities who are responsible for this slaughter of the innocents .
Is there anything of a practical nature that can be done to solve the problem in the short run ?
Probably not .
But do not give up hope .
Right before the decline and fall of communism in Russia and Eastern Europe , there were few who thought this scourge would soon be removed .
Another benefit of the present book is that it attempts to demonstrate the viability , efficaciousness , and , yes , morality , of the private - enterprise system , addressing a difficult case in point .
If we can establish that private property and the profit motive can function even in " hard cases " such as roads , the better we can make the overall case on behalf of free enterprise .
The book is organized according to the following plan .
The basic theory of privatization , specifically as applied to roadways , is put forth .
The case on behalf of commercializing this sector of the economy is made on the basis of improving road safety and decreasing traffic congestion .
Next , this theory is applied to a whole host of related issues , such as automobile insurance , holding parades on public streets , and immigration .
Our present institutional arrangements are characterized as socialistic .
Then , we assume as a given the goal of privatizing traffic arteries , and instead focus on the very complex process of getting to there from here : what are the problems of transition , how would the authorities move from a situation under their control to market determination , etc . ?
The next part of the book is given over to dealing with objections to the foregoing .
Critiques are launched at several commentators , including Gordon Tullock , Lawrence White , Herbert Mohring , and Robert Poole .
This book concludes with an interview conducted with me by several Canadian libertarians .
MIAMI , Florida ( CNN ) --
It 's a nightmarish scenario straight out of the movies : A passenger is forced to land a plane after its pilot becomes incapacitated .
Passanger Doug
White landed this Super King two - engine turboprop after the pilot fell unconscious .
" Descend and maintain 5,000 .
Just take your time , we 'll set you up for the airport , " an air traffic controller says .
In a calm voice , a passenger responds : " I need to get my throttle set for this descent .
I do n't know where to set it at . "
The reality was playing aboard a plane over Florida on Sunday in what the National Air Traffic Controllers Association called " an Easter miracle . "
The incident began about 1:30 p.m .
The plane , a Super King Air two - engine turboprop with four passengers on board , was headed to Jackson , Mississippi , from Marco Island , Florida , about 18 miles south of Naples .
The plane entered the jurisdiction of air traffic control at Miami Center , the facility responsible for high - altitude air traffic in southern Florida and the Caribbean , according to a statement issued by the air traffic controllers association .
The pilot notified controllers that the plane was at 9,000 feet and climbing , said Steve Wallace , Miami Center spokesman for the association .
However , a controller at the center tried twice to raise the pilot after that and received no response , Wallace said .
Hear audiotape of emergency landing »
After a few moments , a different voice came over the radio : Passenger Doug
White told air traffic controllers the pilot was unconscious and they needed help .
His wife and two teenage daughters were flying home to Louisiana with him , he said .
Listen to White describe seeing the pilot 's eyes roll back in his head »
He reported the plane 's autopilot was on and the plane was continuing to climb from 10,000 feet .
" I told my girls to pray hard , " White later told CNN television affiliate WINK .
White later told the Naples Daily News he has a pilot 's license and about 130 hours experience flying a single engine Cessna , but had never flown the larger , faster King Air .
The difference , experts said , is not as simple as driving a different model of car .
A turboprop multi-engine , Wallace told CNN , " probably lands at a faster speed than he 's ever flown a single - engine plane before . "
White told air traffic controllers it appeared the pilot had died , according to the statement , and he reported that the plane 's autopilot was on and the plane was continuing to climb from 10,000 feet .
Two air traffic controllers worked to help him disengage the autopilot , as other controllers stepped in to lighten their workload .
" Keep it coming around when you can ... the turn looks good , very good sir , " a controller said .
The controllers then turned the plane over to air traffic controllers at the airport .
One of them had called a friend who was certified in the King Air planes for advice .
" They walked him through flipping the switches , turning the knobs , " Wallace said .
White , who was composed for the most part , seemed doubtful for a brief moment .
" When I touch down ... If I ever touch down , do I just kill the throttle or what ? " he asks .
The landing was successful .
" I knew we had to do something ... I knew that much , " White told WINK .
The Federal Aviation Administration has not given any of the involved air traffic controllers permission to speak about the incident , Wallace said .
However , the National Air Traffic Controllers Association lauded all of those involved in landing the plane .
" If you were to ask any one of the controllers who worked this even about what happened over the skies of south Florida , they would tell you that it was just a typical day at the office and that it was merely their job , " association President Patrick Forrey said in the statement .
" However , the actions they all took to save the passengers aboard the flight were beyond heroic . "
Victoria Moreland , spokeswoman for Southwest Florida International Airport , said the pilot 's death was confirmed after the plane landed .
The cause of death was unclear , Moreland said .
It 's rare for a pilot to suffer a medical emergency during flight , said Chris Dancy , spokesman for the Frederick , Maryland - based Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association .
The organization issues a yearly summary of accident trends and factors based on National Transportation Safety Board reports involving aircraft of less than 12,500 pounds -- smaller than the King Air involved in Sunday 's incident .
According to the most recent report , which covers the year 2007 , out of 22 million general aviation flight hours , an estimated 15 million to 20 million flights , only six instances of a pilot 's medical incapacitation were reported , he said .
In four of those instances , the pilot died .

NAACP leader blasts Huckabee for comparing abortion to slavery Ron Brynaert

This A NAACP leader is blasting former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee for comparing abortion to slavery .
Huckabee 's comments were made " Monday speech during a fundraiser for an anti-abortion group , " the Associated Press reports .
" The half - hour speech was the keynote address during a luncheon fundraiser for the Jefferson City - based Vitae Caring Foundation , " the AP notes .
" The organization , created in 1991 , sponsors advertisements across the country encouraging women to seek alternatives to abortion . "
The AP adds , " Huckabee said that when it abolished slavery , the U.S. debated and decided it was immoral for one person to have complete , life - or - death power over another .
He said that should not change whether the control involves racial bigotry or a pregnant woman making a decision for her unborn child . "
" What are we saying to the generation coming after us when we tell them that it is perfectly OK for one person to own another human being ? "
Huckabee said .
" I thought we dealt with that 150 years ago when the issue of slavery was finally settled in this country , and we decided that it no longer was a political issue , it was n't an issue of geography , it was an issue of morality .
That it was either right or it was immoral that one person could own another human being and have full control even to the point of life and death over that other human being . "
According to Missourinet.com , Huckabee added , " The idea that one person , in this case a biological mother , would have life and death control over another human being - albeit her own child - but could have that level of ownership over another is no longer just an issue of politics or culture , but the utmost essence of moral behavior of a civilized people . "
Missouri NAACP
President Mary Ratliff told the The Associated Press that the comparison was " ' apples to oranges ' and called it offensive to use the issue of slavery for an unrelated political point . "
" It seems to me now that when folks want to object to some kind of morality type of issue , they want to attach it to slavery , " Ratliff told the AP .
This is n't the first time Huckabee has made the comparison .
Two years ago , in his failed quest for the Republican presidential nomination , Huckabee explained to Fox News , why the " law of the land " did n't lead him to leave abortion as a state issue as then - rivals Senator John McCain and Fred Thompson had stated on the campaign trail .
" Well , its the logic of the Civil War , " Huckabee said in 2007 .
" If morality is the point here , and if its right or wrong , not just a political question , then you cant have 50 different versions of whats right and whats wrong .
Again , thats what the whole Civil War was about .
Can you have states saying slavery is OK , other states saying its not ?
If abortion is a moral issue -- and for many of us it is , and I know for others its not .
So if you decide that its just a political issue , then that s a perfectly acceptable , logical conclusion .
But for those of us for whom this is a moral question , you cant simply have 50 different versions of whats right . "

Temperatures could be in the 30s People need to make sure they have a fair weather friend they can call on for aid in the event of a heatwave this summer , officials have advised .
The Department of Health 's Heatwave Plan urges everyone to be aware of the health risks faced by elderly friends and relatives during a hot spell .
It says homeowners can stay cool by painting their houses white and planting shrubs for shade .
Forecasters say it is still too early to say if this summer will be hot .
Other tips include identifying the coolest room in the house .
For the very young and older people or those with serious illnesses , heat can be dangerous .
In particular , it can make heart and respiratory problems worse .
TIPS TO STAY COOL Shade south and west - facing windows Paint buildings and surrounding walls white to reflect heat Plant small trees and shrubs around buildings
Replace metal blinds with curtains with white linings to reflect heat outwards where possible .
In extreme cases , excess heat can lead to heat stroke , which can be fatal .
The Met Office says it is too early to tell whether it will be a very hot summer this year , but the signs so far are that it will be warmer than our last two summers and conditions could well trigger its heatwave warning system .
In London , this would mean daytime temperatures had exceeded 32C and night - time temperatures were over 18C degrees .
In the North West , it would be 30C and 15C , respectively .
Wayne Elliott , Head of Health Forecasting at the Met Office , said : " Summer is nearly with us and it's a good time to prepare for the high temperatures that we can experience in this country . "
Stay cool
The Heatwave Plan has been updated to advise those suffering breathing problems that although ozone levels increase in hot weather , they drop in the evening .
People with respiratory problems should stay inside during the hottest part of the day and windows should be kept shaded and closed when the temperature is hotter outside than inside .
Yvonne Doyle , Regional Director of Public Health for the South East Coast said : " This year 's plan encourages everyone to take practical action before a heatwave strikes .
" Keeping the home as cool as possible during hot weather and remembering the needs of friends , relatives and neighbours who could be at risk is essential . "
People are advised to contact their local environmental health officer if they have concerns for themselves or a vulnerable friend , neighbour or relative .
Environmental health workers at local authorities can visit to inspect the condition of a home for hazards to health , including excess heat .

Over the last sixteen months , many Americans have watched with despair as the Federal government has wrested virtually despotic control over the American economy away from both individual Americans and private enterprise .
They have observed the Federal government ’s frantic ( and totally unsuccessful ) attempts to prop up banks that have revealed themselves to be completely incompetent and bankrupt .
They have watched the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board printing more money than has ever been created in the history of these United States .
They have watched their so - called " representatives " handing out unimaginable sums of their own hard - earned tax money to scores of bungling companies , like AIG , General Motors , and Chrysler .
They have watched in cynical amazement as their newly elected president almost instantaneously broke his promise to end the most un-winnable of two un-winnable wars that they specifically elected him to terminate .
They have watched him similarly break his promise to investigate the myriad grisly crimes of the claque that used to claim to be their rulers .
And they have watched the American economy steadily slipping further and further into depression .
The ordinary Americans who have observed the unfolding of this tragic and ridiculous charade can perhaps be forgiven for thinking that the Federal government is now completely outside of their control .
After all , they have made their collective opinions known to their so - called rulers time and again , and yet they have been completely ignored .
Moreover , they now find themselves confronting an economy on the brink of inflationary ruin and outright socialization , a government considering at least three new costly military adventures , and a surveillance and police state with virtually unchecked powers over them .
Fortunately for the fate of this nation , however , the despairing idea that Americans have lost all control over the Federal government is very much mistaken .
While it is indeed true that the Federal government has scorned their opinions and seized virtual despotic control over their private lives and the economy at large , ordinary Americans have not lost even a farthing ’s worth of control over the Federal government .
Their capacity to rein in their so - called rulers and set this nation back on the path to peace , prosperity and respect for individual property rights remains very much intact — and in some ways has actually been strengthened by the events of the past sixteen months .
The key to understanding why Americans still retain the capacity to reign in their behemoth government ( and even the ability " to alter or abolish it " ) lies in recognizing that there are more of us than there are federal agents , tax collectors , central bankers , congressmen , and regulators .
For every central banker tinkering with the value of our money , there are tens of thousands of ordinary Americans who will soon be watching their savings evaporate .
For every tax collector forcing us to hand over our money to the U.S. Congress , there are tens of thousands of ordinary Americans just scraping by — hoping to keep what they earn instead of working for the benefit of Goldman Sachs ’ crooked managers .
For every regulator seeking to control how we live and work , there are tens of thousands of ordinary Americans who do not feel particularly inclined to having every aspect of their lives counted , managed , arranged , and dictated according to the whims of faceless bureaucrats .
For every crooked congressman ( or congresswoman ) selling out to or cowering before the far - right Israeli government and its American apologists , there are hundreds of thousands of ordinary Americans who prefer to keep completely out of the terrible and murderous game called " Middle East politics . "
Nothing that has occurred over the past sixteen months has altered the crucial fact of our superiority in numbers [ PDF ] .
Now , it is true that superiority in numbers does not necessarily translate directly into victory for individual liberty over " omnipotent government . "
The barbaric slaughter of over 38 million innocent people by the vastly outnumbered communist Chinese government attests to this fact , for example .
What our massively overwhelming numbers do give us , nevertheless , is the undeniable ability to take back our individual liberty and free our economy whenever we are sufficiently motivated to do so .
Their diminutive numbers , coupled with the fact that all of their income is solely parasitically derived from us , means that no matter how large and powerful the Federal government might appear , its henchmen will never , ever , be able to keep our liberty from us if we decide to take it back .
The fact that we can take back our freedom whenever we can sufficiently motivate ourselves to do so ought to dispel any despairing thoughts we might entertain in the current economic and political environment .
For , in the first place , the current crisis has created a massive number of Americans ( an army , as it were ) who are completely dissatisfied with their current position in this hyper - regulated , fascist , and hyper - belligerent state .
A growing number of Americans are unemployed , and have no hope for finding new work , thanks to the blunderings and criminal actions of the Federal government and their cronies in the Federal Reserve System .
A growing number of Americans are returning from wars their " rulers " concocted ( or which were concocted by foreign governments ) and refuse to end , only to find that the Federal government now considers them to be a " terrorist threat . "
A growing number of Americans are graduating from college only to ruefully learn that they have been duped by the Federal government into taking out loans they cannot possibly pay back , and that they have no hope of finding good jobs .
A growing number of Americans are now homeless , thanks to the mindless stupidity of the American congress and the appalling arrogance of certain members of the Federal Reserve Board .
A growing number of Americans are now incarcerated for using or selling " drugs " by a government that has promoted massive trafficking in these substances itself .
And a growing number of Americans are just plain sick and tired of paying year after year to kill Pakistanis , Iraqis , Iranians , Afghanis , Somalis , Serbs , Nicaraguans , Cubans , Angolans , Salvadorians , Chileans , Palestinians , et cetera ad nauseum .
What is more , this growing group of angry , disaffected and persecuted Americans is different in a critical way from the people that were slaughtered en masse by the likes of Hitler , Stalin , Mao , and Pol Pot .
Unlike the poor peasants slaughtered in frigid Soviet gulags , for example , present - day Americans are armed — both literally and figuratively .
In the figurative sense , Americans have at their disposal sources of information about the sordid activities of their so - called " rulers " like never before in human history .
They have news outlets at their disposal that tirelessly chronicle the Federal government ’s ongoing crimes on foreign and domestic soil .
They have institutions at their disposal that make the acquisition of genuine knowledge about economic and political theory completely accessible to anyone with a computer .
That not all Americans have taken advantage of these priceless sources of information is irrelevant — the very fact that they exist and continue to faithfully execute their individual missions means that the American public can arm itself with the truth whenever it so chooses .
These institutions are rather like a grandfather ’s M1 Garand stowed away in the attic of his flaccid grandson ’s condominium .
That the present owner does not know how to shoulder his grandfather ’s rifle is irrelevant to the fact that , so long as he owns it , he could always choose to learn how to use it .
Add to this the fact that private Americans are literally armed to the teeth ( and are continuing to arm themselves at a feverish pace today ) , and you have a people that could never , ever , be subjugated by the Federal government or any other menace — as long as Americans choose to refuse to allow themselves to be robbed or otherwise dominated by far - away places like Washington D.C .
Naysayers and pessimists can point all they want to the " sheepishness , " indolence and decadence of the American people .
They can shout until they are blue in the face about how the American people have lost the proud sense of independence and individualism that marked their revolutionary forefathers .
None of these objections , however , are relevant in the least to the question of whether Americans have lost control over the Federal government .
On the contrary , these objections only point out that at the present moment relatively few Americans have chosen to stand up for themselves — they certainly do not prove that Americans cannot stand up for themselves and throw off this awful and deadly Federal yoke if they were to so choose .
And , as long as the host creatures continue to vastly outnumber the parasites , any talk about lost control is fatalistic nonsense .
If anything , objections of this ilk should only prod us to say to ourselves and our neighbors " Go , thou , and do something to cast off this horrendous Federal yoke ! "
That ’s what I ’m trying to do , and I hope I ’ll see you at the barricades fighting for your liberty , instead of sitting at home in the dark , mired in self - defeating self - pity .

Belgian Gets a Taste of Airline Justice
Erik DeckersLaughing Stalk SyndicateCopyright 2009
Nicholas Cantisani still has nightmares from his arrest when he was dragged off his airline flight in April .
His crime ?
He leaped to his feet , charged the cockpit , and threatened everyone on board .
Just kidding .
He was arrested for asking why the flight was delayed for more than two hours .
So Philadelphia police dragged Cantisani off the flight , and held him for hours without any food or water .
Cantisani , who is blind from birth , was sitting on the plane with his wife .
They had been in New York visiting family , and were returning home to Brussels , Belgium .
Their plane had backed away from the gate , and sat on the runway for two hours without moving .
Airlines will back away from a gate and call it a departure .
They do it so they can keep their on - time departure stats up .
However , the time of the landing is marked when the plane touches down , not when it arrives at the gate .
Either way , they can sit and wait for as long as they want , and there 's not a darn thing you can do about it , because they 'll arrest you if you raise a stink .
Just ask Cantisani .
According to the Philadelphia Daily News , Cantisani , who is a professional translator , was charged with resisting arrest and disorderly conduct .
He was arraigned this past Thursday .
After the plane sat for a while , they were told the plane would be delayed , but were not given any reasons why .
Cantisani said they were n't allowed to use their phones , receive any food or drinks from the flight attendants , or even move from their seats .
Cantisani , not being familiar with the martial law imposed by all airlines when it comes to questioning their authority , stood up to ask for water and to speak to the crew .
He was ordered to sit down instead .
Later , he talked with the captain , and was told the problem was " mechanical difficulties . "
No problem .
Cantisani sat back down and waited .
Sometime later , another passenger made a comment about the crew , so three cops escorted him off the plane .
( Oh sure , THEY get to move around . )
Then they tried to remove Cantisani .
So Cantisani , flashing back to the " then they came for me " poem by Martin Niemöller , refused to leave , shouting " I am not a trade unionist .
" Just kidding .
He actually did refuse to leave , clutching his seat belt so tightly they could n't take him away .
And three cops against a blind 61 - year - old man will win every time .
He injured his hand , lost his retractable cane , and said one cop had him by the throat .
Lt. Frank Vanore , a police spokesman , told the Daily News they had been called to the gate because of " a disorderly passenger . "
He did not specify if the rabble rouser was Cantisani or the other passenger who hurted the crew 's feewings .
My favorite line in the whole story : Lt. Vanore said he did not know of any " blind test " that the police did .
In fact , I do n't know that there is any kind of " blind test " ever .
I used to work in the blindness field for over a year , and I can tell you there is no such thing as a " blind test . "
At least not one a police officer is certified to give .
Which makes me think their so - called test involved jumping out and shouting " BOO ! "
Or more likely it involved the cops hollering " I SAID , CAN YOU HEAR ME ? " Cantisani was then questioned by a psychiatrist to determine his mental state .
" I SAID , ARE YOU CRAZY ?!" At 3:00 a.m. , he was taken to the police station , and was detained until late that evening .
" I was never read my rights .
I was put against the wall , told to put [ my ] hands on the wall , empty [ my ] pockets and undo my shoelaces , " Cantisani told the Daily News .
" Then , I was shoved into a 6 - by - 7 - foot cell and that was it .
" Cantisani said no one believed he was blind until the end of his stay .
I hope they at least felt stupid enough to apologize to him . " I SAID , WE'RE VERY SORRY WE DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU !
" Cantisani said he is not planning to return to Philadelphia , which means his lawyer will represent him in court .
It also means Cantisani is able to remain in Europe and tell the Philadelphia Police what they can do with their arraignment .
" I SAID , YOU CAN FREAKIN ' BITE ME ! "---

Advertisement Sri Lanka says 63,000 Tamil civilians have escaped from the last remaining area of territory held by Tamil Tiger rebels in the past two days .
The army said it had made further inroads into the small area in the north , searching for the rebel leader .
It said some civilians fled by sea and were met by the navy .
They were being transferred to government - run camps .
The rebels alleged the army had killed about 1,000 civilians in the latest fighting .
There is no confirmation .
The rebels also said that about 2,300 civilians have been injured since Monday morning , and accused the government of using Tamil people as human shields and forcing them to clear landmines .
See map of the region A deadline for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) to surrender or face a final assault expired at 0630 GMT on Tuesday with no word from the Tigers .
However , hours later a rebel official vowed to continue the battle .
" LTTE will never surrender and we will fight and we have the confidence that we will win with the help of the Tamil people , " Seevaratnam Puleedevan told Reuters news agency .
The head of the Sri Lankan army , Lt Gen Sarath Fonseka , told the BBC Sinhala service that troops know the " general area " of Tamil Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran and that " action will be taken to destroy him " .
This is our problem and we will sort out our problem .
Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara
Bitter end for Sri Lanka 's rebels ?
Tough search for truths
" We do not know exactly the place where he is hiding , but we suspect he is most probably hiding among the civilians , trying to take cover behind them .
" Therefore we have to be very careful about what action we take to ensure that no civilians get harmed . "
Rebel leader Prabhakaran was hiding in coastal strip about 8 km long and 1.5 km wide , Lt Gen Fonseka said .
Troops believe he could try to escape the war zone by boat , a method used by other rebel leaders .
There is no media access to the area , so it is difficult to interpret the parallel propaganda war , says the BBC's Charles Haviland in Colombo .
The general said only 300 - 400 Tamil Tiger fighters remained , but there may be 700 " forcibly armed " people in rebel bunkers .
Sri Lankan military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara told the BBC's Newshour programme that the army had rescued the civilians after breaking down earthen defences , rather than forcing them to flee amid fighting , as suggested by the rebels .
TAMIL TIGER DEFENCES BREACHED BY SRI LANKA ARMY 1 . 12 km - long defensive earthworks constructed by Tamil Tigers using mechanical diggers 2 . Sri Lankan army uses explosives to destroy a 3 km section 3 .
Gap allows thousands of refugees to flee Tiger - held territory
" We went in and people came towards us and we rescued them and [ have ] taken them to a better location , where they can have a better life than what they had in this safety zone under the LTTE [ Tamil Tiger rebels ] . "
He dismissed any suggestion that international assistance would help resolve the conflict .
Brig Nanayakkara said : " This is our problem and we will sort out our problem . "
Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa also rejected international offers , telling British Prime Minister Gordon Brown that there was no need to send a special envoy and a pause in fighting was not necessary .
" President Rajapaksa observed that this movement of civilians had evoked a completely new situation and he had instructed that additional consignments of food , medicine and other essentials be dispatched , " a government statement said .
Gordon Weiss , the UN spokesman in Sri Lanka , said it was not known how many civilians remained there but that the UN had been working off a figure of some 150,000 to 200,000 people in recent months .
' Catastrophic ' situation The International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) said it was " extremely worried " about civilians still trapped in the zone .
" The situation is nothing short of catastrophic .
Ongoing fighting has killed or wounded hundreds of civilians who have only minimal access to medical care , " said director of operations Pierre Kraehenbuehl .
The rebel TamilNet website said the territory they still controlled was littered with bodies of civilians .
Video released by Tamil supporters shows mutilated bodies , but it is not clear when the recording was made .
They said it was filmed on Monday , but this can not be verified .
It follows footage released by the government showing civilians fleeing the war zone .

A follow - up to Ed ’s post , just because your enjoyment of this story wo n’t be complete without witnessing her comically palpable discomfort for yourself .
What better way for The One to smooth things over with the intel honchos on which his counterterror strategy depends than by having the Democratic Speaker of the House call them a bunch of serial liars on national television ?
CNN has the Cliff ’s Notes version of the vid but I ’m giving it to you uncut so you can watch the most shameful part , which runs here from about 5:30 to 9:30 .
To refresh your memory of the timeline , there ’s no dispute that she knew waterboarding was going on by February 2003 , when one of her staffers went to a briefing on it and relayed the details to her .
The question is simply whether she found out even earlier than that , in September 2002 , after the CIA had started waterboarding Abu Zubaydah .
Why does the timing matter ?
Um , it does n’t : Even if it ’s true that the CIA told her in 2002 that they were only thinking of using the technique , the very thought of it should have ignited her righteous progressive outrage .
Instead , her defense here — I kid you not — is that by the time she learned they were waterboarding people in 2003 , Jane Harman had become the ranking member on the intelligence committee and so , you know , it was n’t Nan ’s job anymore to speak up .
Besides , she was too focused at the time on the big Democratic electoral turnaround … which would n’t happen for another three years .
Make sure you watch at least to the part where she insists she does n’t think she should have done more to stop the program .
There ’s that old activist liberal spirit !
As Andy Levy says , “ Nancy Pelosi ’s lies are so transparent birds are slamming into them . ”
Meanwhile , as this soap opera ’s playing out , Dick Cheney ’s request to declassify the two CIA memos which he claims prove that torture works has been denied .
Surprise .
Exit quotation : “ President Obama has the legal authority to declassify the documents ‘ with the wave of his hand , ’ according to one expert . ”
Update : I want to highlight this bit from Ed ’s post because it really is the million - dollar question :
And if the CIA really had lied to her in the briefings , why did n’t Pelosi start out with that explanation ?
In fact , why did n’t she mention that in 2005 when both the EITs and the briefings were made public ?
Coming four years later , this explanation lacks any kind of credibility .
The killer quote from today ’s presser is “ they mislead us all the time , ” a reference to the CIA ’s bad intel on Iraq ’s WMD .
If there really is a pattern of deception going on , why would she wait until there ’s a Democrat in the White House to complain when she could have pinned the whole thing on Bush by screaming about it earlier ?
Mechanical fault puts French aircraft - carrier out of action
by Staff Writers
Paris ( AFP ) March 13 , 2009
France 's sole aircraft - carrier , the nuclear - powered Charles de Gaulle , was out of action again Friday , only months after undergoing a lengthy refit , the navy said .
The pride of the French fleet would be immobilised for weeks if not months after abnormal wear was discovered in links between the two of the four turbines and their propellor shafts , a statement said .
The problem was discovered when excessive vibration was detected , the navy said , adding that further examination was required .
The Charles de Gaulle , which entered service in 2001 , was working up following its first major refit which lasted 18 months and ended in November .
It had been expected to resume active service in the next few weeks .
Facebook governance results a few minutes before the voting closed .
Credit : Facebook.com
Updated , 8:44 a.m. : Facebook says it will ignore the 30 % threshold this time and consider the results valid .
By the time voting closed today at noon Pacific time , only 0.32 % of Facebook 's users had weighed in on the question of whether the site 's lengthy new policy documents were better than the lengthy old ones .
About 75 % of that 0.32 % chose the newer policy , while the rest chose the old .
But the election wo n't count anyway : Facebook said that for the results to be valid , 30 % of its roughly 200 million users would have to weigh in .
That 's about 100 times more than the 0.32 % of people who actually did .
Why did Facebook so grossly overestimate interest in its experiment with online government ?
Start with the subject of the vote itself :
New terms of service vs. old terms of service .
Global warming , civil rights or nuclear disarmament this is not .
The issue can't even rightly be said to be black and white .
It does n't help that the new terms -- though written in more concise and readable language -- substantially overlap with the old ones .
Both new and old documents describe licensing terms , rules of user conduct , account termination and several other minor technical matters .
The documents are so similar that in order to figure out the differences , you 've got to read both documents side to side , and / or refer to a confusing third document that tries to explicate some of the changes .
Suffice it to say that even figuring out what you 're voting on -- if anything -- takes an hour of eye - strain .
Most of Facebook 's high school and college - age users already have enough government homework to do , and its grown - up users are either trying to find jobs or keep their current ones , so voting on the future of a website 's small print may not have been a priority .
There have been signs recently that Facbook has allowed its sense of self - importance to grow rather inflated .
In a recent video , CEO Mark Zuckergberg grandiosely compared the site to a real nation , noting that , population - wise , it " would be the fifth - largest country in the world " and that it therefore merited " a more transparent and democratic approach to governing . "
In its own eyes , Facebook has become more than merely a recreational website where users share photos and wish each other a happy birthday -- it is now a global body of citizens that should be united and protected under a popularly ratified constitution .
But it 's hard to have a democracy , a constitution or a government if nobody shows up to participate .
Which means , presumably , that the pretense of democracy will be now abandoned and things will go back to normal .
Facebook will make its own decisions about how it wants to run its business , and when users disagree , they 'll scream bloody murder .
It 's the natural order of the Internet ; why mess with it ?

The villagers of Jalimudi , a small village in the state of Andhra Pradesh in Southern India , have been suffering from a shortage of water for years .
However things have changed , as they are now getting water from the air as a result of technology developed by Air Water International Corporation , a company that manufactures air to water machines that can offer consumers from 25 liters to over 5,000 liters of pure filtered drinking water daily .
Jalimudi is the first village in the world to have a sustained water supply that does not originate from the sea , underground water sources , or supplies brought in from elsewhere .
The “ Jalimudi – Air Water Station ” has drawn major attention with over 60,000 hits to the company ’s web site to view the short video detailing the project and its major impact on the local villagers .
In the words of Michael Zwebner , president of the company ,
“ The local inhabitants of Jalimudi have immediate and constant access to clean clear and pure water 24/ 7 .
This exciting ‘ Jalimudi – Air Water Station ’ project will be we believe the first of many as the word gets out and around of the amazing technology and its factual application to real use .
Our unique water machines will now sustain the lives of the locals , and provide a real solution for the water needs of all the local inhabitants .
Interest is high , and application for information about the project and how it can be duplicated or adapted in other areas of the world , is coming to us on an ever increasing basis . ”

Reading through the details of the decision was immensely troubling , because it seemed to calculate the amounts on a somewhat meaningless formula based on taking a percentage of revenue from the companies that had absolutely nothing to do with music itself .
Basically , it looked at almost any revenue that somehow sorta kinda touched on music ( including search ) and included that as part of the calculation process .
Recently , ASCAP and Google went through a similar case in front of the same district court to determine just how much Google has to pay ASCAP for all the music streamed on YouTube .
To be honest , I 'm still not sure why it makes sense that Google has to pay anything for this , but that 's one of the oddities of modern copyright law .
While the decision has n't received much press attention , last week , the court ordered Google to pay $ 1.6 million to ASCAP ( thanks to Eric Goldman for sending me the decision ) .
The court seemed to take a " split the difference " approach , as ASCAP had asked for $ 12 million for all music streamed between 2005 and the end of 2008 ( and another $ 7 million for 2009 ) .
YouTube , in response , had suggested $ 79,500 for 2005 through the end of 2008 and then $ 20,000 per quarter ongoing .
The court rejected both proposals , and dinged both companies for weakly supporting their positions , or being somewhat misleading in their assertions .
Google , for instance , tried to focus on the number of " music videos " as compared to the total number of videos on YouTube , though the court noted that the music videos seem to get a lot more views than many of those other videos , and it does n't take into account the time spent viewing each video .
ASCAP basically said : " just take that formula you used last year for AOL , Yahoo and Real and apply it to Google revenue .
"
The court , instead , went into a lengthy justification of trying to come up with a " fair " proposal , involving an awful lot of redacted information on YouTube 's revenue ( though ... if you work through all the numbers you might be able to piece back together some revenue info ) and eventually came up with $ 1.4 million for 2005 through 2008 , and then $ 70,000 per month afterwards , which , when added to the additional fees this year , brought it up to $ 1.61 million to date ( and counting ) .
Of course , this is all supposed to be a temporary sort of thing until the two sides can work out an agreement on their own -- but given the vast differences in proposals ( as the court noted , ASCAP was asking for a rate 150 times as large as YouTube 's proposal ) , it does n't seem like the two sides are close .
Either way , reading this ruling as well as last year 's ruling shows what a total mess this process is .
Basically , ASCAP gets to go in and demand cash from anyone who benefits from music anywhere , and a judge sorta randomly makes up reasons to give them cash .
I know that ASCAP supporters will claim that the money is for songwriters , not the record labels , and it 's important and blah blah blah .
But the whole system of such collective licenses is a mess that it makes it close to impossible to do anything with music without getting yourself into a huge licensing hole .
For more than a century now , Congress and the courts seem to look at every innovation and simply slap another license fee on it , and leave it to the courts to sort out any mess .
All of these license fees add up to a massive tax on innovation that divert money from good business models and into the hands of collections societies , who siphon off a piece and often do n't do a very good job distributing that cash .
It 's a massively inefficient model that 's simply not needed .

OTTAWA–American President Barack Obama , soon to visit Canada , has indicated to the Canadian government he is not interested in delivering a speech to the Canadian parliament , a government spokesman confirms .
Up to now , critics have suggested the Conservative government is the one seeking to downplay the visit , prompting criticism , notably by the NDP's Pat Martin , that it would be a " travesty " not to have the wildly popular U.S. president address the Canadian people through Parliament .
Martin had called for the Conservatives to recall Parliament to sit during a scheduled holiday for the Feb. 19 visit .
But Kory Teneycke , communication director for Prime Minister Stephen Harper , confirmed late Wednesday that the decision was made by Obama 's people to keep this a " working visit " without any of the pomp and ceremony of a state visit .
The advance team for Obama was in Ottawa last week , and the tentative agenda would see Obama meet briefly with Governor - General Michaëlle Jean , possibly at his arrival at the Ottawa airport , where he is also expected to address U.S. Embassy staff .
But it was the clear preference of the Obama administration to avoid a formal parliamentary address .
In fact , he will not make a major public address on Parliament Hill either , confirmed Teneycke .
Obama is expected , however , to spend the four or five hours he is in Ottawa at Centre Block where he will hold meetings with the Prime Minister , and most likely with the Leader of the Official Opposition , Michael Ignatieff .
" My sense is that they want to get down to business , and they 're kind of out of campaign mode ( after ) the last two years , " he said .
" My guess is they probably want a president who is seen down to business and working and not doing an international PR tour . "
For Obama fans , few glimpses of the president will likely be possible as Parliament Hill is expected to be largely shut down in the interests of security .
" I know the president is probably the most famous person on the planet right now , but I can certainly understand why they would be less worried about the celebrity factor and more worried about projecting a president at work and spending his time here actually working . "
The agenda for the two leaders will be largely focused on the economy .
Other items will be energy and the environment , and Afghanistan .
The fisheries agency said activists had stepped up attacks on whaling ships
Japan 's annual Antarctic whale - hunting season has fallen short of its target catch because of disruptions by anti-whaling activists , officials say .
Japan 's Fisheries Agency said its fleet had killed 679 Minke whales out of a planned 935 , and just one Fin whale , despite a target of 50 .
It partly blamed the disruptions on the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society , a US - based environmental group .
Protesters had escalated their attacks on Japanese ships , the agency said .
The Fisheries Agency said 16 days of hunting were lost due to bad weather and confrontations at sea between activists and the six - ship whaling fleet .
It added that several hunting ships were damaged in collisions or by chemicals thrown by the protesters .
Cultural tradition
Japan abandoned commercial whaling in 1986 after agreeing to a global moratorium .
But its fleet continues to hunt whales in the name of scientific research , which is allowed under international rules .
Whale meat not used for study is sold for consumption in Japan - which critics say is the real reason for the hunt .
The meat can be found in supermarkets and restaurants across the country .
Many people in Japan regard whaling as a cherished cultural tradition , says the BBC's Roland Buerk in Tokyo .
Generations of children have been given whale meat for their school lunches , our correspondent says .
Consumption of whale meat is now low , but attempts have been made to increase its popularity by marketing whale curry and whale burgers , he adds .
Stephen Wolfram has warped my life three times , and now here comes a fourth .
When I first interviewed him in 1984 , he converted me to his belief that everything in the world resembles a certain kind of parallel computation called a cellular automaton , ( or a CA for short ) .
I became obsessed with studying CAs — which produce hypnotic computer graphical outputs akin to light shows .
And this led to me riding the wave of computer science for twenty years as a professor at San Jose State University .
In 1988 Stephen developed the powerful Mathematica software that lets a computer manipulate mathematical expressions in an intelligent way .
My first consulting job outside of academia involved writing Mathematica demos for the design tools company , Autodesk , where I also worked on a number of other science software projects — until the tanking market of the early 1990s sent me back to teaching CS again .
In 2002 Stephen published his magnum opus , A New Kind of Science , ( called NKS for short . )
The NKS system is based on the observation that each process which we find in nature can be regarded as a computation that has a very simple underlying rule .
Given the world ’s apparent complexity , it seems counterintuitive that the world could be based on simple rules .
But computer scientists like Wolfram have amply demonstrated that simple rules can in fact generate complex behavior .
An example : a simple rule describes how billiard balls bounce off each other , but if you set a bunch of balls in motion , the resulting patterns are quite intricate .
I became so fascinated by this set of ideas that I retired from my teaching job to have time to write my own tome on the subject :
The Lifebox , the Seashell , and the Soul .
The side effect was that I was finally off the teaching treadmill , and free to spend more time with my first love , writing science fiction .
And now , in 2009 , a new kind of browser search engine called Wolfram| Alpha is about to appear .
The other day I talked to Stephen on the phone for about two hours , and he demonstrated some of Wolfram| Alpha ’s powers via a web - conferencing hook - up .
In the following , I ’ll be paraphrasing his words , based on my notes , my memory , and an audio recording of our conversation .
If you want to delve further , we ’ve placed a slightly condensed podcast of the conversation online at https://wp.dagiopia.net/media/sw_alphapodcast.mp3.
Kicking off our conversation , Stephen remarks that , “ Wolfram| Alpha is n’t really a search engine , because we compute the answers , and we discover new truths .
If anything , you might call it a platonic search engine , unearthing eternal truths that may never have been written down before . ”
Despite his disclaimer , Wolfram|Alpha looks like a search engine , in that there ’s a one - line box where you type in a question .
The output appears a second or two later , as a page of text and graphics below the box .
What ’s happening behind the scenes ?
Rather than looking up the answer to your question , Wolfram| Alpha figures out what your question means , looks up the necessary data to answer your question , computes an answer , designs a page to present the answer in a pleasing way , and sends the page back to your computer .
Let me give three random examples .
If you enter the query , “ 3/26/2009 + 90 days ” you ’ll get a page that gives a date ninety days later than the first date .
If you enter “ mt. everest height length of golden gate ” you ’ll get a page expressing the height of Mount Everest as a multiple of the length of the Golden Gate Bridge .
If you enter “ temperature in los gatos , ” you ’ll get something like the current temperature , a graph of the temperatures over the last week with projections for the next few days , and a graph of the temperatures over the last year .
Wolfram|Alpha can pop out an answer to pretty much any kind of factual question that you might pose to a scientist , economist , banker , or other kind of expert .
The exciting part is that you ’re not just looking up pages on the web , you ’re getting new information that ’s generated by computations working from the known data .
Wolfram says the response can be so speedy because , “ We ’ve found that , of all the things science can compute , most take a second or less . ”
Wolfram sees his new program as being part of a history of mankind ’s attempts to systematize knowledge .
“ We have the encyclopedists trying to write everything down .
We have people like John Wilkins trying to create an analytical language for thought .
We have philosophers and scientists hoping to find a universal theory of the world .
But all these attempts founder on the vastness and the subdivisibility of the tasks . ”
He feels that the turning point came with Newton and Leibniz .
“ Before Newton , nobody had the notion of trying to compute the truth .
They always thought in terms of reasoning things out like a human would do .
But the point is n’t to emulate a human being .
The point is to find an answer .
Leibniz came closest to the notion of Wolfram| Alpha , with his plan for a universal library , and with his dream of a logical system for calculating truth . ”
He regards Wolfram| Alpha as a natural outgrowth from his own work on Mathematica and on the NKS notions of complex computation .
“ Most of us only have one idea , ” he remarks .
“ My idea is to make the world computable .
Mathematica was about finding the simplest primitive computations , and designing a system where humans could hook these computations together to create patterns of scientific interest .
NKS was about the notion that that we can start with primitive computations and not bring in humans at all .
If you do a brute search over the space of all possible computations , you can find ones that are rich enough to produce the natural - looking kinds of patterns that you want .
And Wolfram|Alpha is about how we might build the edifice of human knowledge from simple primitive computational rules . ”
I asked him about how Wolfram| Alpha developed .
“ In a way , I ’ve been thinking about this project since I was twelve years old — when I typed up a list of all the scientific constants and rules that I could find .
I started seriously working on it two or three years ago , as a break from the work I ’d been doing on trying to find a fundamental theory for physics .
But it was only a year ago that I started thinking that Wolfram| Alpha could really work as a commercial product — the data structures , the curating of data , and the hardware infrastructures to answer people ’s questions on the fly .
We ’re right at a historical moment where this is finally becomes feasible . ”
I remarked that it must have been difficult to figure out how to convert people ’s inputs into something like computer code , and how to find the rules to calculate the answers to the questions embodied in the code .
Wolfram : “ This is where the NKS approach comes in .
In a general way , the NKS notion that everything is computable gave me the confidence to go ahead with Wolfram| Alpha at all .
It ’s because of NKS that I ’m willing to believe that we can find a computational model for every branch of science .
And , more specifically , we used the NKS notion of searching the space of all possible computations in order to find the rules that we use for understanding user input .
I mean , there ’s lots of algorithms from computational linguistics that you might consider , but it ’s hopeless to reason out which might be the best ones .
So we set up a big list of test cases and ran a huge number of algorithms on these .
And we also use NKS search methods for designing the customized web pages to present our answers . ”
We talk a little more about user input .
Wolfram remarks that , “ Language has this shallow level of grammar and a deeper structure of meaning .
What users spurt into an input box is close to being what linguists call deep structure .
But there ’s no one rule for understanding this kind of input — and that ’s why we turned to a family of algorithms that we found using NKS . ”
I asked him how he is handling the daunting task of finding out all the possible scientific models .
“ There ’s only so many linear feet of reference books that exist in the world , ” remarked Wolfram .
“ Nowadays when I go into a library I look at the reference shelves and try and estimate how many of them we ’ve picked up .
I think we ’re close to ninety percent by now .
Right now my office is mounded with books with bookmarks for things we still need to implement , and one by one the bookmarks and the books are going away . ”
He remarks that it ’s not enough to just munge through all the books .
It ’s also necessary to talk to experts .
This is where Wolfram ’s high - profile status as a computer scientist comes in .
He has a lot of friends in a lot of fields .
“ Pretty much every branch of knowledge that we ’ve coded up has an expert in the chain , ” he says .
“ It ’s important to include what you might call guild secrets — tricks or rules of thumb that practicing experts use .
Some of these things are n’t in books and are n’t well - known . ”
Looking ahead , Wolfram anticipates using an NKS kind of approach for finding new theories .
“ Rather than just searching for the best algorithms for things like understanding user input , we want to start searching for the best models for a given field .
A model is a kind of algorithm for predicting results from existing data .
And we ’d like to start finding these models on the fly .
Once again , the issue is not to emulate humans , but rather to bulldoze a shortest path to an answer . ”
For complex reasons having to do with personality issues and academic politics , some scientists are not especially fond of Wolfram and of his NKS .
He hopes that Wolfram| Alpha may help to vindicate his worldview .
“ People are always asking what NKS is good for .
And I think Wolfram| Alpha can be a first example .
It ’s not as if I ’m using all of NKS for it .
But think of a historical analogy .
Alan Turing developed the notion of a universal computer in the 1930s — and nobody was sure what it was good for .
And then , in the 1960s we started seeing word processors — one of the first really big applications for computers .
I think Turing might have been surprised that one of the first great uses for his ideas would be something so pedestrian .
In an analogous way , Wolfram| Alpha might be the first massively popular application of my ideas .
People using it will be using NKS , even though they ’re not aware of it . ”
I asked Wolfram if he was thinking in terms of selling off Wolfram| Alpha to a big company like Google .
“ I ’m not a selling things kind of guy , ” he said firmly .
He sees his new program as a long - term project whose development he wants to guide .
“ We ’d rather look for things like partnerships or licensing deals or APIs .
I see a new field of knowledge - based computing .
Imagine a spread sheet that can pull in knowledge about the entries . ”
I wondered how Wolfram|Alpha compares to the so - called Semantic Web — an intelligent web project that ’s been kicking around for several years now .
“ The problem with the Semantic Web is that the people who post the content are expected to apply the tags , ” remarks Wolfram .
“ And the tagging system involves a complicated categorization of all the things that might exist — what philosophers call an ontology .
Like any comprehensive world - system , the Semantic Web ontology is subject to endless revision , with many gray areas .
For instance if there ’s a cell phone antenna on a bridge girder , is the structure a bridge or a cell phone tower ?
It ’s proved easier for us to hand - curate the existing data that we find in books and on the web .
This is feasible because a lot of the data we ’re interested in is purely scientific — things like the chemical formula of some compound .
As this kind of data is n’t being constantly revised , it ’s possible to stay ahead of the curve . ”
I ask him if down the line , Wolfram| Alpha will let users input data and models , along the lines of Wikipedia .
He says they will in fact allow that , although via a less open system than Wikipedia .
Contributors would need to fill out a form , including some references verifying that their information is correct .
Wolfram and his team are in a high state of tension , gearing up for Wolfram| Alpha ’s public release — currently scheduled for May , 2009 .
The biggest practical issue involves infrastructure .
Will they have enough servers to handle the load ?
He remarks that his needs are n’t anything like Google’s .
“ We wo n’t be continually crawling the web and recomputing our index , ” he remarks .
“ Most of our computational needs center on converting user inputs into Mathematica - like queries , and then computing the answers to these queries .
Answering one query might use a hundred of our computers running flat out for a fraction of a second .
So we ’re still trying to gauge how many computers we ’ll need . ”
As Wolfram|Alpha comes into widespread use , Stephen believes “ It will raise the level of scientific things that the average person can do .
People will find that the world is more predictable than they might have expected .
Just as running Google is like having a reference librarian to help you , running Wolfram| Alpha will be like having a house scientist to consult for you . ”

RICHMOND | Some legislators want Virginia to join the growing chorus of states that have defied the federal government by refusing to participate in a national identification program billed as a way to fight terrorism and identity theft .
Two pieces of legislation for consideration when lawmakers return to Richmond on Jan. 14 call for Virginia to ignore the federal mandate to come into compliance with the Real ID Act by the end of 2009 .
Similar bills went nowhere last year , but supporters say the looming deadline gives the issue new urgency .
“ Basically , this statute that I put in is one to let the feds know that , one , the way you ’re going about this we have problems with , and two , if you intend to enforce this , we intend to challenge it , ” said Delegate Robert G. Marshall , Prince William Republican and one of the sponsors .
Since the law ’s enactment in 2005 , at least 42 states have considered anti-Real ID legislation , and more than half have passed measures either forbidding their states from participating or urging Congress to amend or repeal the law .
At least five states have gone in the other direction , passing bills bringing their programs into compliance .
Critics say they expect other states to join Virginia this year to fight against Real ID .
The program was born out of the commission that looked into the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
It recommended that the U.S. improve its system of issuing identification documents because the hijackers had numerous licenses and state IDs .
Congress approved legislation requiring states to issue licenses and ID cards that meet certain security standards .
The new IDs will be required for federal purposes , such as boarding an airplane or entering a federal building .
Other federal identification , including passports and military IDs , also will be accepted .
“ The bottom line is that citizens of states who do not move forward with the Real ID mandate from Congress will see real consequences , ” said Laura Keehner , a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security , which is in charge of the program .
States had until May 2008 to implement Real ID , but the department extended that until Dec. 31 , 2009 .
If they need more time and have met certain benchmarks , states can request an extension until May 11 , 2011 .
“ The fact that Congress passed this and could not figure out the prudential question of when the states could actually do this tells me that it was n’t thoroughly vetted , ” Mr. Marshall said .
The opposition has centered around cost and privacy concerns .
Homeland Security originally estimated it would cost states $ 14 billion to implement the program , but in January it loosened the restrictions and said the added flexibility would bring the cost to under $ 4 billion .
Homeland Security and other agencies have given out about $ 500 million in grants , but state officials say that ’s not enough .
Critics also claim that Real ID diminishes privacy , and they object to a national ID that would have to be shown for everyday identification purposes .
“ Certainly people should be identified by high standards when that ’s called for , but it ’s not called for when you ’re going to buy beer , ” said Jim Harper , director of information policy studies for the Cato Institute , a libertarian think tank .
“ If we ’re going to have our identity recorded every time we buy beer or use a credit card or buy gas , that turns into one big surveillance system , ” he said .
But Ms. Keehner said the identification cards will increase , not decrease privacy by preventing identity theft .
She said claims that the program creates a national database are incorrect .
There is a hub where each state Department of Motor Vehicles will check to ensure that an individual has only one ID , but states will not have access to other states ’ data .

The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that the “ official ” unemployment rate for April is 8.9 % , a stunning jump from 4.8 % just a year earlier .
It is the highest jobless rate since the glory days of the Reagan Revolution in 1983 .
The country lost 539,000 jobs last month , which reporters are scrambling to put a happy face on by saying that “ analysts had predicted a loss of 600,000 , ” although this difference is more than offset by the 72,000 temporary government jobs associated with the 2010 census .
Over 4 million million jobs have been lost in the past six months , and over 5 million during the last 16 straight months of job losses .
However , to get back to pre-recession / depression rate ( if things magically started recovering like last week ) we would need to add 7 million jobs , to account for the growth in the population .
The real story , of course , is much grimmer .
The official BLS rate ( shown in line U3 of the monthly reports ) only counts those actively seeking work .
Line U6 of that same report , however , gives a more accurate picture of the state of unemployment .
This rate stands at 15.8 % for April 2009 , up from 8.9 % a year earlier .
( All the info comes from the BLS website ) .
The U6 number includes the following :
* Discouraged workers : those who have looked for a job in the past twelve months but given up .
* Marginally attached workers :
This group includes discouraged workers above , as well as others who have looked for work in the recent past and would accept a job if offered .
They are not included in the “ official ” count because they have not looked for work in the past four weeks .
* Part - time workers for economic reasons :
This group includes people who are employed part time , but are actively seeking full - time work because they want ( and presumably need ) it .
A more accurate description is “ involuntary part - time workers . ”

Yahoo Answers is the home of some of the dumbest questions ever posed by humans .
Here are some of the all - time best .
Yesterday , against my better judgment , I fell down the rabbit hole of Yahoo Answers .
For those unfamiliar , Yahoo Answers is like the Wikipedia of advice .
People ( about 40 percent of whom can spell ) write questions and rely on the masses to get their answers .
While in my rabbit hole , I found so many stupid questions ( and stupid answers ) that I could n’t stop laughing .
My face is still sore .
Anyway , after a huge debate with myself , I narrowed it down to my favorite 11 ridiculous questions from Yahoo Answers .
And I share them with you now .
Feel free to send me any others you ’ve found in your Yahoo Answers adventures … this list is just begging for a part two one day .
These are in no particular order .
Also , I ’m just going to give a big fat [ SIC ] to the entire thing —
I ’m leaving in all the spelling , grammar and punctuation errors as they are part of the essence of Yahoo Answers .
He continues :
I know it may sound weird , but my parents are still pretty young and have very loud sex and sometimes late at night I can hear them and I cant help but touch myself .
Is this bad or is it something other people have done too ?
Well , no .
But he definitely came to the right place for logical , helpful , compassionate support .
Like a user named Kendra who says :
its not nasty , i remember when I was younger me and my bro would hide in the closet so we could see it .
And we ’re just getting started .
This one is MADE in the guy ’s description of his question :
Hi .
Does anyone know if it ’s possible to use a background that would essentially turn my computer monitor into a mirror ?
Scanning a mirror does n’t work .
So as dumb as that is … yeah , I thought for two seconds about what would happen if I scanned a mirror .
ok im kinda worryed here since my g/f got pregnant and all she isnt been havein her period do u think the baby is drinkin the blood ???
she 6 month pregnant
I DO think the baby is drinking the blood !
There is literally no other explanation .
What you ’ve got on your hands is a vampire baby .
Your girlfriend has been having sex with a vampire .
And I ’m suspecting it ’s a biracial baby , either half - black ( if she got it on with Blacula or Count Chocula ) or half - purple ( if she got it on with The Count ) .
On one hand , this could almost be a deeply existential question .
Unfortunately , I do n’t think that was the intent .
I have been with my boyfriend for 6 months now , he ’s my absolute everything .
But last week he got told he has bad ‘ Skin Cancer ’ , When he told me i was heartbroken .
Should i tell him that we should end it ?
or should we stay together ?
:( x
I think this made me laugh the hardest of all .
Is that bad ?
I love the guy ’s description of his habits :
I have around 15 - 20 orgasms a day .
Sometimes I reach into the 30’s .
I do it a lot , but I really do n’t know how to stop .
First off , 15 to 20 times a day should n’t be humanly possible .
You ’d have to cut out some other major component of your life to have the time .
Like eating .
Or breathing .
But for me , truly , this question rises into the pantheon when a female offers up the very first response :
wow thats alot i only have like 2 or 3
You kids today !
Absolutely .
The only acceptable way to integrate Jesus into food is to accidentally burn his face into a piece of toast or on a grilled cheese sandwich and then sell it on eBay .
Jesus would be proud that you can get Golden Palace to pay $ 500 for it .
8 | I live in georegia but i dont see rusia no where not even sound but they says theres tanks should i be worrie
This one was taken down after it was an Internet sensation a few months back .
But it ’s still an all time classic .
And as much as my instinct is to think it ’s fake … something about it just says “ real ” to me .
I WANT to believe !
You had to know that the person who does n’t know if night exists outside of his hometown would make a traditional Internet generation your / you ’re switch .
She describes a traditional My First Smoking story :
my friends are over and I smoked WAYYY too much im all dizy and i ca n’t see straight the room is moving
This one does n’t get good until she starts elaborating with more details a little later on in the night :
my peanut btuter tastes like ice cream i thought the pillow was the cat ahhh ” .
Brilliant .
He continues :
Or is it in the back where a boys — is ?
I know this is an odd question but i have a valid reason to ask it .
The most succinct answer comes from a poster who uses the name Riley J :
yes women have penises on the inside thats how they pee they just dont stick out like mens do ” .
Perfect .
The question is answered .
( And sadly , the guy who posted it refused to elaborate on his “ valid reason to ask . ” )

5 . A cult has sprung up in the deep and rundown parts of the city that has begun to speak of the ultimate sacrifice , to espouse the spilling of sacred blood in the divine sacrifice to the one true god , the one perfect being incarnate , a second Christ , warrior of God given chitinous flesh .
The government has made several attempts to infiltrate the cult or discover why some of its highest priests have begun to disappear , but ultimately their attempts have been unsuccessful , their agents going undercover , only to never return again .
Perhaps even more unnerving , ( if the players manage to connect the dots , ) are a series of grisly murders that have cropped up in the sewers and the darker places of the city which have begun to catch the eye of the media .
Locals are abuzz with stories about seeing large , ferocious beasts in the sewers , Chupacabra and dragons that stalk the darkness beneath the streets and houses of the city .
This can provide a great way to bring a group of players into the Aliens universe , and might even provide an excellent jumping off point for future missions financed by the company or those forces trying to keep them in check .
( Sort of a “ well , you ’ve seen this much , you ’re involved now ” kind of thing . )
6 . In the process of researching the xenomorph for bioweapons application , certain elements within the government ( who happen to have heavy ties with corporate ) have arranged a test , choosing an out of the way , upstart pioneer colony way out on the rim as the subject .
With transports getting out that way only about once every six years , and the known presence of elements that have been labeled as budding , anti-corporate anarchists , it is the perfect place to study the xenomorph in action using feeds from local cameras and spy bugs tied into a network that runs through a satellite in orbit .
The plan ?
Pay off the captain of a vessel that makes trips to that particular middle of nowhere to replace a crate of supplies with a dozen xeno eggs , two of them confirmed as queens .
Does the crate breach en-route ?
What happens when the crate is discovered by the colonists ?
Where do the players come in ?
Are they already on the planet ?

7 . At it ’s core , every film in the Aliens series has a strong element of horror to it .
Consider mixing in elements of other takes on horror with the basic terror and escape or bug - hunt action players are familiar with from the series to amp up the tension and the fear .
Let the Xenos loose in the basement of an S&M club , have them terrorize a carnival and fill the players minds with hunts that happen in the mirror halls of the fun house or rows upon rows of cocooned clowns sick and ready to burst .
Take advantage of the Aliens ’ propensity to adapt the traits of their hosts to their own form and create a world full of Xenos spawned from massive snakes and giant spiders , or pit the players against an overwhelming zerg style rush of Alien bodies that leaves them feeling hopeless and desperate .
8. Someone ( or something ) has obtained a sample of Xenomorph biomaterial and is designing modified versions of the Alien in an underground lab on an abandoned planet .
The entire operation is real hush hush , and how the word gets out is up to you , but eventually something goes very , very wrong ( maybe they set off a gene that allows the Xenomorphs to breed at an incredible pace by simple asexual division like cells ) and the planet becomes a nesting ground for an entire host of modified Xenomorph species that either band together to form symbiotic relationships , or attack one another outright , intent on a cleansing genocide of chitinous skin and acid blood .

Town Officials and Journalists Unclear On Fractions :
Cape Cod Times reports :
[ Headline : ]
Truro zoning decision hinges on single vote Voters narrowly approved one of four zoning amendments late Tuesday night at the annual town meeting .
But town officials were still looking at the exact vote count on that article yesterday .
In a vote of 136 to 70 , voters passed a new time limit on how quickly a cottage colony , cabin colony , motel or hotel can be converted to condominiums ....
The exact count of the vote — 136 to 70 — had town officials hitting their calculators yesterday .
The zoning measure needed a two - thirds vote to pass .
A calculation by town accountant Trudy Brazil indicated that 136 votes are two - thirds of 206 total votes , said Town Clerk Cynthia Slade .
Brazil said she used the calculation of .66 multiplied by 206 to obtain the number .
But using .6666 — a more accurate version of two - thirds — the affirmative vote needed to be 137 instead of 136 , according to an anonymous caller to town hall and to the Times .
Slade said that she called several of her colleagues to see how they calculate a two - thirds vote , and the answer varied widely .
In Provincetown , Town Clerk Doug Johnstone uses .66 .
But Johnstone said he'd never had a close vote where it might matter .
A spokesman from the Secretary of State 's office was not available to comment yesterday .
Slade said she will let the state Attorney General 's office decide on the correct count , as part of their normal review of town meeting decisions ....
Now let 's be careful here , since there are so many problems here that it 's easy to miss some .
( I assume , by the way , that the article is correct in saying that a two thirds vote is required to pass the amendment , which the Truro Charter seems to confirm . )
1. Voters did n't " narrowly approve [ ] " the amendment ; they narrowly disapproved it .
It does n't matter what the town official says ; 136 is not 2/3 of 206 .
[ UPDATE :
The reporter e-mails me , in response to a query , " the article is considered to have passed by town meeting .
but it will be reviewed ( as all general and zoning bylaw articles are ) by mass .
attorney general before it is enacted . "
But whatever the town authorities might have said , the voters did n't narrowly approve the amendment — their vote fell short of the legally required 2/3 . ]
2 . The affirmative vote needed is n't 137 , since 2/3 of 206 is 137.333 ... , which means 137 is less than 2/3 of 206 .
The affirmative vote needed is 138 .
3 . Therefore , the zoning decision did n't " hinge [ ] on [ a ] single vote " — even if the one vote had changed , so the total would be 137 to 69 , still not 2/3 .
To pass with 206 people voting , two voters would have had to switch sides .
4 . I realize this item is a bit pedantic , but .6666 is n't a more accurate version of two - thirds .
There is only one 2/3 , not multiple versions .
.6666 is a more accurate approximation to 2/3 than is .66 .
5 . If you need to calculate 2/3 on a calculator , there 's no need to choose an approximation of two - thirds — you can just multiply by 2 and divide by 3 .
6 . But beyond this , who needs " an anonymous caller to town hall and to the Times , " or even a calculator here ?
If you need 2/3 ayes ( and assuming , as the article does , that this is 2/3 of those who cast a vote , not 2/3 of those present ) , then the only question is whether there are at least twice as many ayes as nays .
136 is less than two times 70 , so 136 is less than 2/3 of the total .
7 . It 's not just one town , but two !
And the answers in different towns " varied widely , " so who knows what else is going on there ?
8 . They need the state Attorney General 's office to multiply 2/3 in Massachusetts .
9 . Finally , the best part — this was supposedly done by the town 's accountant .
Hey , a lawyer I could understand , but should n't the accountant be the one person who knows better ?
Thanks to Adam Bonin for the pointer .
While many people were expecting the arrival of Easter Bunny greeting e-cards over the weekend , an unwelcome " Twitter bug " hopped onto many systems , too .
According to reports , the worm was still mutating and affecting countless user profiles well into Monday .
Initial reports of the " Mickeyy " worm began on Saturday morning at around 2 a.m. , as users were hit with a barrage of questionable messages .
As is becoming the norm for most malware attacks ( ie. Koobface ) , users were enticed to click onto an infected page posted by another user .
The clicks then set off a chain reaction that posted annoying tweets to other members .
On Sunday morning at around 11 a.m. , the worm had affected roughly 90 accounts , which Twitter successfully contained and secured .
However , the social networking haven later learned that a second , more intense version of the worm was still spreading and had affected an additional 100 accounts .
As of press time , Twitter has secured and contained the second version of the worm , although a third wave is believed to be already in existence .
( Source : yahoo.com )
The entire situation is being called a " vicious cycle " and one in which Twitter will continue to battle throughout the week .
More Annoying than Damaging
Mickeyy is being described as more of a nuisance than a damaging virus , as the worm sends out false tweets in an attempt to collect usernames and browser cookies .
The good news is that no sensitive Twitter information was compromised in the attacks .
There is a way to combat the virus :
Twitter must close the cross-scripting hole in their profile code .
The bad news is that of the three sites that have hosted versions of the code , one is still active , which allows for the mutation and its continued existence .
( Source : newsfactor.com )
Creator had ' Nothing Better to Do '
What is shocking about the entire ordeal is that Twitter believes they know exactly who is responsible for creating the mutating worm : a teenager by the name of Michael " Mickeyy " Mooney .
Apparently , the teen created and implemented the worm " out of boredom " .
( Source : netnewsdaily.com )
The Mickeyy virus mirrors the infamous Samy worm , which infected the popular social - networking site MySpace a while back .
At the time , MySpace reacted with a lawsuit against the virus creator which resulted in a felony charge and a harsh sentence .
Twitter did not comment on what actions will be taken against Mooney .
Accelerating health - care premiums and sharp revenue shortfalls due to the recession are forcing some small companies to choose between dropping health insurance or laying off workers -- or staying in business at all .
Sheryl Weldon , owner of Commerce Welding & Manufacturing Co. , saw health - insurance payments increase to more than $ 800 monthly per employee from about $ 200 five years ago .
With monthly revenue down 10 % since December , Ms. Weldon stopped providing health coverage to employees , including one being treated for prostate ...

Actually , Roger was correct when he stated that the credit goes to the person who wrote the software .
There was a similar robot a few years back that could ' create art . '
A question arises though : who is the real creator of the art ?
The robot , or the guy who ceated the software for the robot ?
Tim
Guest Comment Sat , Apr 04 , 2009 , 9:42 am CDT
This is different than an art robot .
This computer software is LEARNING .
If we intill a human with knowledge , and they regurgatate that information , the originator of the knowledge shold be credited .
But if that human uses that knowledge to learn somthing new , then they can be credited with discovering that NEW knowledge .
Same thing applies here .
Can I take credit for the intelect of my children ?
I think not .
But if I was a good parent and taught them everything I know ; when they make some sort of scientic discovery beyond what I taought them , I would hope they at least thank me .

The Sharpened Sticks of Quantitative Easing
I am proud to announce that I am the winner of the Mogambo Guru newsletter ’s famous and much - anticipated “ Name The Era Contest ” – a task made easier by the fact that I just invented the contest and mine was the only entry .
However , the contest seems especially pertinent this year since we appear to have achieved almost - universal participation by the world ’s central banks to create massive amounts of money and credit with which to buy ( “ bailout ” ) other people ’s losses , thus making them “ whole . ”
Are you suddenly asking , “ Why would a government – even a government as nutzoid as the laughable commie - think Democrats in America – allow such a crazy thing , which guarantees Massive Freaking Inflation ( MFI ) in consumer prices that will destroy everything ? ”
Is that what you are asking ?
Well , the answer is simplicity itself :
Tax revenues !
It ’s all just to keep these losing people and corporate entities from declaring these huge losses on their tax returns , thus paying no taxes !
It ’s that simple !
And ( from the government ’s perspective ) it ’s all made worse by the people carrying all the rest of their monumental , multi-trillion dollar not - yet - deductible losses forward indefinitely to future tax years , whereby to offset any gains the people might make then , again paying no tax .
THAT’S why the bailouts !
Hahaha !
In fact , the Wall Street Journal reports that the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government found that “ State tax collections continued to fall in the first quarter as muted consumption , falling incomes and weak profits plunged states into a deeper financial hole , ” as they deduce from the 47 states that have reported their statistics , and 45 of these 47 states “ saw revenues decline , ” the particulars being “ total tax collections fall 12.6 % – about $ 20 billion – compared with the first three months of 2008 . ”
Yikes !
First - quarter government revenues down by 12.6 % in the first quarter !
See what I mean ?
However , the biggest collapse was in income taxes , and “ Corporate income taxes declined 16.2 % in the latest quarter , reflecting weaker profits ” which should be bad news as far as the stock market and everybody ’s retirement account is concerned .
As for us workaday schlubs , us backbone - of - America types who get up every day and go to our stupid jobs ( even though we hate it as much as we hate everything , and everybody , connected with it , especially the commute back and forth where those people in the other cars act like they are singing along with the radio , but who do n’t know that I can tell that they are really saying how they want to kill me ) , the news is that incomes went down so much that “ personal income taxes fell 15.8 % . ”
And , as one would expect in a collapsing economy where people are paying off debt and refusing to loan money to relatives who say nasty things about you behind your back , and then are all smiles to your face when they want to borrow some money , but who then get all pissy when you laugh at them and ask them where is all the gold and silver that you have told them to buy over the years ?
They admit that they did n’t buy any !
And now , they are seemingly saving money instead of borrowing to consume , as sales taxes were down 7.6 % !
Wow !
Maybe this lack of spending is because they are losing their jobs , or because they owe more on their house than it is worth , or they are watching their taxes and prices rising as their incomes stagnate or fall , and are so indebted that they owe , collectively , almost 380 % of GDP ( a new record of personal irresponsibility and conceited stupidity ) .
Plus , maybe their kids are the whiny kind that never shut up and who know all of their “ rights ” and it just seems like hell on earth .
Who knows ?
However , I see that I have strayed from the subject , which was about the proud winner ( me ) of the Mogambo Guru newsletter “ Name The Era Contest ” and how my winning entry was “ Period Of Quantitative Easing ( POQE ) ” which barely edged out my other terrific competing entry , which was “ The biggest freaking piece of stinking , insane monetary and fiscal excess crap into which the world ever stepped , and which makes you want to scream your bloody guts out in your fear , in your anger , and in your sheer outrage at what has been done to us by a corrupt Congress with the ‘ aiding and abetting ’ of the Federal Reserve , which created the money and credit that financed it all . ”
What put POQE over the top was that it was so deliciously apt , as it sounds like “ poke ” when pronounced as a word , which is itself an apt metaphor for the massive “ quantitative easing ” increase in the money supply that will create massive inflation in prices and massive , twisted distortions in the economy , in this case an economy malformed by the federal government deficit - spending a truly astonishing $ 1.84 trillion budget deficit this year , for a total of over $ 3 trillion in federal spending , a horror that can be , as I said , aptly liken to sharpened sticks poking at you , constantly poking you , poking you , poking , poking , poking you everywhere , harder and harder , faster and faster , sharper and sharper , pain upon pain , bleeding you dry , but especially poking you in the groin and in the eyes just to make it as miserable as possible and you cry like a little baby , just as you do when inflation in prices grinds and grinds you and your family down and down .
And although everybody can clearly hear somebody ’s mother saying in the distance , “ Watch out !
You could poke his eye out ! ” all you hear is cruel , mocking laughter that never stops , and the poking of inflation never stops .
Or should I say POQE -ing ?
Hahaha !
And that is why one should not stop buying gold , silver and oil , which is easy to remember , as it should be , as , “ Whee !
This investing stuff is easy ! ”

Judges can take a market - driven economic downturn into account when dividing property between divorced spouses , the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled today in a case that 's expected to have a monumental impact on the province 's family courts .
In a complex 3 - 0 ruling , the court set aside a trial judge 's decision from 2007 that required Harold Serra to make an " equalization payment " of $ 4.1 million to his ex-wife , Barbara .
Serra complained that , between the time the couple separated and the time their case got to trial , the value of his Ajax textile business had diminished from $ 11.25 million to between $ 1.8 and $ 2.6 million - a drop of between $ 8 and $ 9 million .
The money he was ordered to pay his former spouse would exceed his net worth , Serra contended .
The trial judge , Justice Thea Herman , said she was not permitted under Ontario 's Family Law Act to take into account a market - driven decline in the value of his assets .
" In my respectful view , she erred in taking this approach , " said Justice Robert Blair , who wrote the appeal court 's decision , reducing Serra 's equalization payment to $ 900,000 .
James Morton , the lawyer acting for Barbara Serra , said the decision represents a " huge change in family law . "
" It 's going to mean a lot of family law cases are going to be opened up now , particularly in light of the drop in value of shares and RSPs . "
Morton predicted husbands who own businesses will try to stretch out court proceedings and claim it would be unconscionable to have their property divided equally based on its value at the time of separation .
On the other hand , in a good economy , spouses , particularly wives , could benefit if their spouses assets spike in value between the time a couple splits up and the time their case gets heard .
Report : State 's big rivers in big trouble Environment
California's two longest rivers , the Sacramento and the San Joaquin , were named the nation 's most endangered waterways by an environmental group that considers them threatened by outdated water management and poor flood planning .
American Rivers , a conservation group that compiles the annual list , chose the Sacramento - San Joaquin river system because its collapse could threaten the water supply of 25 million Californians , flood the state 's capital and damage the delicate freshwater delta where the two rivers twine .
" The Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta is on the verge of losing important fish species , and the communities that surround it already do n't have adequate protection from their levees , " said Steve Rothert , California director of the Washington , D.C. , nonprofit .
State water officials did not immediately comment on the new report .
The Sacramento and the San Joaquin meet in the delta , a freshwater estuary surrounded by an aging network of fragile levees .
That system has harmed the rivers ' floodplains , a crucial habitat for fish and other species that use that area to feed and reproduce , Rothert said .
The delta also forms the heart of the state 's water - delivery system , where snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada is rerouted through canals and pumps to reach millions of Californians and thousands of acres of croplands .
President Barack Obama signed a wilderness bill last week that implements a 2006 legal settlement to bring water and Chinook salmon back to a portion of the state 's second - longest river , the San Joaquin .
It provides about $ 390 million in federal and state funds in the next decade .
Germany 's exports have been hit hard by the global slowdown Germany 's economy will shrink by 6 % this year and continue to contract in 2010 according to a forecast from the country 's leading economic think tanks .
The estimates , compiled by eight institutes for the German Economy Ministry , also predicts that the rate of unemployment will hit 10 % next year .
The gloomy forecast chimes with that of the IMF , which shows the German economy contracting by 5.6 % this year .
This is faster than any other major economy apart from Japan , says the IMF .
" The joint forecast of the institutes paints a very dark picture of German economic prospects in the foreseeable future , " said Timo Klein at IHS Global Insight .
Severe contraction
The latest twice - yearly forecast shows just how rapidly the outlook for the German economy has deteriorated .
Through 2009 we anticipate a loss of more than 1 million jobs
Joint report from German economic think tanks
The think tank 's previous forecast predicted economic growth of 0.2 % for this year .
The deepening global downturn now means the group sees a severe economic contraction this year and a further shrinkage of 0.5 % next year .
" For 2010 the institutes expect no drastic rebound , " the report said .
The IMF is forecasting a contraction in the German economy of 1 % in 2010 .
Comments by some of Germany 's largest companies confirmed the bleak outlook for the country 's economy .
" It will probably take five years before demand is back to its pre-crisis level in 2007 , " said Karl - Thomas Neumann , boss of car parts firm Continental .
The chief of rival Robert Bosch , Franz Fehrenbach , said : " We expect to see a deep recession until well into 2009 . "
Job losses
The report for the Economy Ministry also forecasts a fall in exports of 22.6 % , compared with its prediction of a rise of 0.1 % made just six months ago .
Germany is world 's largest exporter .
Unemployment , the report says , will hit 10.8 % in 2010 .
" Through 2009 we anticipate a loss of more than 1 million jobs ... and in the [ autumn ] unemployment will be well over the 4 million mark , " the think tanks said .
The IMF forecast sees the Japanese economy contracting by 6.2 % this year before growing by 0.2 % next year .

The University of Cambridge today received a Gömböc .
It was donated by its inventors Gábor Domokos and Péter Várkonyi .
But what is a Gömböc and what is the University going to do with it ?
A Gömböc ( pronounce goemboets ) is a three - dimensional body with one stable and one unstable equilibrium point .
If you put it down on a horizontal surface , it will start wobbling around until it has safely reached the equilibrium position , a bit like a Weeble toy .
In theory , you could balance it on the unstable equilibrium point , but in practice that 's really hard because the slightest nudge will make it fall over , just like a pencil that is balancing on its tip .
Unlike a Wheeble , whose self - righting ability is down to a weight in its bottom , the Gömböc is homogenous inside : its density is the same everywhere , ie there is no off - centre weight which forces it to take on a particular position .
The Gömböc is also convex .
The question of whether a convex and homogenous body with one unstable and one stable equilibrium exists in three dimensions was first raised by the Russian mathematician Vladimir Arnold .
Mathematicians knew before that in two dimensions there are no such shapes , and they also knew that every three - dimensional object must have at least two equilibria .
Domokos and Várkonyi started working on the question and did not only prove that the Gömböc exists , but also built one .
In fact , they 're building many , from different materials , and they 're selling them on the Gömböc website .
The Gömböc is not only beautiful and interesting , but also sheds some light on how a certain species of turtle , with a Gömböc - like shell , manages to get back on its feet after it has been toppled over .
Gömböcs need to be engineered to the highest levels of precision , otherwise they wo n't work .
The Gömböc that was today donated to the University of Cambridge can be admired at the Whipple Museum of the History of Science .
Plus will interview its inventors next month and you 'll be able to read the interview here soon .
You can see a Gömböc doing its thing on YouTube , though the video clip is in German .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. Senate Democrats on Tuesday moved to cut $ 80 million earmarked for closing the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay , a fresh setback for President Barack Obama ’s efforts to move beyond the Bush administration ’s anti-terror policies .
In this January 21 , 2009 file photo , reviewed by the U.S. Military , leg shackles are seen on the floor at Camp 6 detention center , at the U.S. Naval Base , in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .

Backpedaling after intense criticism from Republicans and even some Democrats , the White House acknowledged it needed to submit a plan dealing with the 240 terrorism suspects being held at the prison on a U.S. naval base in Cuba .
Obama has pledged to close the prison by early 2010 and asked that $ 80 million be included in pending legislation that would fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
That measure is expected to pass Congress in the coming days or weeks .
“ The president and Congress will work together on a timeline for a renewed request for whatever resources are needed , ” said White House spokesman Robert Gibbs .
“ The president still believes it is in our national interest to close Guantanamo Bay . ”
Obama plans to give a speech on Thursday to further detail his policy on the prison and anti-terror tactics after criticism from rights groups that he has flipped on key promises like ending military tribunals for the detainees and releasing abuse photos .
The Guantanamo prison is perhaps the most visible symbol of President George W. Bush ’s legacy and the arguments over U.S. anti-terror policy threaten to become a distraction for Obama as he seeks to focus on efforts to fix the ailing economy .
“ Every administration makes mistakes .
They made mistakes by the way they are handling it and now they are trying to fix it , ” said Senator John McCain , Obama ’s 2008 presidential foe .
McCain said he would try to help the administration fix it but , “ they dug themselves a very deep hole . ”
While the Pentagon said it would work on a blueprint for swiftly closing the prison , spokesman Geoff Morrell questioned if that could be done .
“ Without funds for this purpose , most any option will be exceedingly difficult to pull off , ” he said .
The Senate will likely vote on Wednesday on an amendment to slice out the $ 80 million and bar using any money through September 30 to transfer , release or imprison any of the detainees in the United States , according to congressional aides .
The war bill also includes other controversial provisions like providing up to $ 108 billion to the International Monetary Fund as it tries to help countries weather the economic storm .
Senate Democrats initially included the money in the $ 91.3 billion war funding bill , but barred the administration from moving detainees to U.S. soil and fenced off $ 50 million until the administration provided a plan for dealing with them .
But they backed off amid criticism that there was no plan for dealing with the detainees and fears any move to bring them to U.S. soil could complicate efforts to prosecute them .
“ The feeling was at this point we were defending the unknown .
We were being asked to defend a plan that has n’t been announced , ” said Richard Durbin , the No. 2 Senate Democrat .
Some Republicans have also insisted the prison stay open .
“ It has appropriate courtrooms for the military commissions that we established a couple of years ago at the direction of the Supreme Court .
No one has ever escaped Guantanamo , ” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said .
The Senate version moves closer to legislation approved in the House of Representatives , which approved a $ 96.7 billion war funding bill last week that also rejected Obama ’s funding request and set limits on releasing them .
Differences will have to be resolved before the legislation can go to Obama for his signature .
Now that the 2010 Chevy Camaro is arriving in customer ’s hands , there has been a lot of back and forth on whether or not the Camaro Convertible and Camaro Z28 will be produced .
First reports concluded that boths models were cancelled due to the economic climate , but it now looks like at least the Camaro Convertible will see the light of day .
As late as last week there was news that GM ’s cost cutting efforts and the fact that their German supplier of the convertible mechanism was insolvent had tabled that effort indefinitely .
It now appears that GM has inked a new agreement and that the supplier is fully operational .
Terry Rhadigan , GM ’s spokesperson , confirmed with Automotive News that production of the Camaro Convertible will indeed still take place .
He indicated that the original late 2010 launch would be delayed until first quarter 2011 .
He stated , “ We always thought it would be one year after the coupe .
Instead we are going two . ”
Unfortunately , the Camaro Z28 may not surface at all for a variety of reasons .
This effort is extremely costly with some estimates putting development as high as $ 50 million .
And the upcoming CAFE requirements of 35.5 mpg mean that this vehicle would be hard - pressed to make the cut in the long run .
But , I must say , I would have loved to have seen this car produced , especially since GM ’s original plan was to use the 6.2 - liter V8 engine from the Cadillac CTS-V .
That powerplant puts out 550 horsepower and would virtually ensure that the Camaro Z28 would dominate the Dodge Challenger SRT8 ( 6.1 - liter V8 with 425 hp ) and go toe - to - toe with the Mustang GT500 ( 5.4 - liter V8 with 540 hp ) .

There ’s a good non-technical overview of cellular senescence , with interviews from some of the field ’s luminaries , in the most recent HHMI Bulletin :
Adding just four genes can turn adult cells back into embryonic - like cells , able to develop into any cell type in the body , according to Daley ’s studies .
In culture dishes , cells from a younger postdoctoral fellow in Daley ’s group were “ youthful and vigorous , ” he says ; many of them morphed into stem cells .
But Daley ’s cells were stubborn , refusing to reverse their clocks .
It seems as a person ages , cells get increasingly stuck in their ways .
Daley is n’t taking it too personally .
“ I ’m deficient in a lot of things , and reprogramming seems to be one of them , ” he says .
He plans to use the observation to understand how to reprogram cells most efficiently .
His finding points out an important concept : cells might not sprout gray hair , get achy joints , or forget where they put their car keys , but they do age .
Several HHMI researchers are just beginning to learn what happens to cells as they grow old , and they ’re making connections between those changes and cancer , deficiencies in wound healing , and other problems that increase in likelihood as a person ages .

It ’s better to be lucky than good .
It ’s even better to be lucky and good .
One can easily imagine all the different ways the rescue of Captain Phillips might have been screwed up–and the political firestorm that would have resulted .
But President Obama appears to have been crisp and decisive throughout …and what can one say about the SEAL sharpshooters –firing from a bobbing ship at a bobbing dinghy and recording three headshots ?
But it could easily have gone wrong , through no fault of the President and the SEALs–a gust of wind , whatever …and then the Administration would have had to waste all sorts of energy on damage control , fending off the second - guessers –Republicans and , all too often , people like me–and perhaps overreacting to the pirate “ threat ” as a result .
Presidencies are , sadly , built or crippled on such quirks of fate .
As it stands , our socialist , pacifist , crypto-Muslim President has bagged three terrorist in the most dramatic fashion and saved a Captain .
Congratulations to all concerned–and let ’s hope that the good luck continues to roll .
Update : Commenter Sgwhiteinfla points out that Newt Gingrich had a busy twitter weekend backseat - driving the situation and he ’s right .
Here ’s a sample :
President obama is making a major mistake in not forcefully oulining the rules of civilization for dealing with pirates
We look weak9:55 AM Apr 11th from TwitterBerry newtgingrich
The correct answer to piracy is to destroy it not negotiate with it Seals can retake the lifeboat Track every boat leaving somalia9:35 AM Apr 10th from TwitterBerry
Oh well .
Nevermind .
I might point out that if we had n’t been negotiating with the pirates they would n’t have been under tow by the US Navy and therefore accessible to the SEALs .
But this has been another chapter in the saga : Republicans Making Fools of Themselves .
What a sorry run .
Over the past five years , Michael Shires , associate professor in public policy at Pepperdine University , and I have been compiling a list of the best places to do business .
The list , based on job growth in regions across the U.S. over the long , middle and short term , has changed over the years -- but the employment landscape has never looked like this .
In past iterations , we saw many fast - growing economies -- some adding jobs at annual rates of 3 % to 5 % .
Meanwhile , some grew more slowly , and others actually lost jobs .
This year , however , you can barely find a fast - growing economy anywhere in this vast , diverse country .
In 2008 , 2 % growth made a city a veritable boom town , and anything approaching 1 % growth is , oddly , better than merely respectable .
So this year perhaps we should call the rankings not the " best " places for jobs , but the " least worst . "
But the least worst economies in America today largely mirror those that topped the list last year , even if these regions have recently experienced less growth than in prior years .
Our No.1 - ranked big city , Austin , for example , enjoyed growth of 1 % in 2008 - - less than a third of its average since 2003 .
The study is based on job growth in 333 regions -- called Metropolitan Statistical Areas by the Bureau of Labor Statistics , which provided the data -- across the U.S.
Our analysis looked not only at job growth in the last year but also at how employment figures have changed since 1996 .
This is because we are wary of overemphasizing recent data and strive to give a more complete picture of the potential a region has for job - seekers .
( For the complete methodology , click here . )
The top of the complete ranking -- which , for ease , we have broken down into the two smaller lists , of the best big and small cities for jobs -- is dominated by one state : Texas .
The Lone Star State may have lost a powerful advocate in Washington , but it 's home to a remarkable eight of the top 20 cities on our list -- including No. 1 - ranked Odessa , a small city in the state 's northwestern region .
Further , the top five large metropolitan areas for job growth -- Austin , Houston , San Antonio , Ft. Worth and Dallas - - are all in Texas ' " urban triangle . "
The reasons for the state 's relative success are varied .
A healthy energy industry is certainly one cause .
Many Texas high - fliers , including Odessa , Longview , Dallas and Houston , are home to energy companies that employ hordes of people -- and usually at fairly high salaries for both blue - and white - collar workers .
In some places , these spurts represent a huge reversal from the late 1990s .
Take Odessa 's remarkable 5.5 % job growth in 2008 , which followed a period of growth well under 1 % from 1998 to 2002 .
Of course , not all the nation 's energy jobs are located in Texas , even if the state does play host to most of our major oil companies .
The surge in energy prices in 2007 also boosted the performance of several other top - ranked locales such as Grand Junction , Colo. , Houma - Bayou Cane - Thibodoux , La. , Tulsa , Okla. , Lafayette , La. , and Bismarck , N.D .
Looking at the energy sector 's hotbeds , however , does n't tell the whole story .
Another major factor behind a city 's job offerings is how severely it experienced the housing crisis .
There 's a " zone of sanity " across the middle of the country , including Kansas City , Mo. , that largely avoided the real estate bubble and the subsequent foreclosure crisis .
Still other factors correlating with job growth -- as evidenced by Shires ' and my current and past studies -- are lower costs and taxes .
For example , the area around Kennewick , Wash. , is far less expensive than coastal communities in that same state , and residents and businesses there also enjoy cheap hydroelectric power .
Compared with high - tech centers in California and the Northeast , such as San José and Boston , places like Austin offer both tax and housing - cost bargains , as do Fargo , N.D. and Durham - Chapel Hill , N.C .
College towns also did well on our list , particularly those in states that are both less expensive and outside the Great Lakes .
Although universities -- and their endowments -- are feeling the recession 's pinch , they continue to attract students .
In fact , colleges saw a bumper crop of applicants this year , as members of the huge millennial generation , encompassing those born after 1983 , reach that stage of life .
More recently , college towns have emerged as incubators for new companies and as attractive places for retirees .
Specifically , the college town winners include not only well - known places like Austin and Chapel Hill , but also less - hyped places like Athens , Ga. , home of the University of Georgia ; College Station , Texas , where 48,000 - student Texas A&M University is located ; Morgantown , W.Va. , site of the University of West Virginia ; and Fargo , the hub of North Dakota State University .
Democratic states are glaringly absent from the top of the list .
You do n't get to a traditionally blue state -- in a departure from past years , Obama won North Carolina - - until you get to Olympia , Wash . , and Seattle , which ranked No. 6 among the large cities .
But political changes afoot could affect the trajectory of many of our fast - growing communities -- and not always in positive ways .
It 's possible that the Obama administration 's new energy policies , which may discourage domestic fossil fuel production , could put a considerable damper on the still - robust parts of Texas and elsewhere where coal , oil and natural gas industries are still cornerstones of economic success .
By contrast , the wind - and solar - power industries seem to be , as of now , relatively small job generators , and with energy prices low , endeavors in these areas are sustainable only with massive subsidies from Washington .
But still , if these sectors grow in size and profitability , other locales that have not typically been seen as energy hubs over the past few decades may benefit - - notably parts of California , although Texas and the Great Plains also seem positioned to profit from these developments .
Another critical concern for some communities is the potential for major cutbacks on big - ticket defense spending .
This would be of particular interest to communities in places like Texas , Oklahoma and Georgia where new aircraft are currently assembled .
Over the years , blue states like California have seen their defense industry shrivel as the once - potent Texas Congressional delegation and the two Bushes tilted toward Lone Star State contractors .
These days it 's big-city mayors and big blue - state governors who are looking for financial support from Obama .
Northeast boosters are convinced more money on mass transit , inter-city rail lines and scientific research will rev up their economies .
Boston -- No. 16 on the list of large cities and a leading medical and scientific research center -- could be a beneficiary of the new federal spending .
The most obvious winner from the recent power shift should be Washington , D.C. The Obama - led stimulus , including the massive Treasury bailout , has transformed the town from merely the political capital into the de facto center of regular capital as well .
Watch for D.C. and its environs to move up our list over the next year or two .
Already the area boasts one of the few strong apartment markets among the big metropolitan areas in the country , which will only improve as job - seekers flock to the new Rome .
Yet Washington is an anomaly , because most of the places that stand to benefit from this unforgiving economy are ones that are affordable and therefore friendly to business , reinforcing a key trend of the last decade .
It also helps regions to have ties to core industries like energy and agriculture , a sector that has remained relatively strong and will strengthen again when global demand for food increases .
Some areas have attracted new residents readily and continue to do so , albeit at a somewhat slower pace .
Over time this migration could be good news for a handful of metropolitan areas like Salt Lake City , which ranks seventh among the big cities for job growth , and Raleigh - Cary , N.C. , which was No. 1 among large cities last year and No. 8 this year .
Over the last few years , these places have consistently appeared at the top of our rankings and are emerging as preferred sites for cutting - edge technology and manufacturing firms .
Below these winners are a cluster of other promising places that have already managed to withstand the current downturn in decent shape and seem certain to rebound along with the overall economy .
These include the largely suburban area around Kansas City , Kan. , perennial high - flyer Coeur d'Alene , Idaho , and Greeley , Colo . -- in part due to their ability to attract workers and businesses from bigger metropolitan centers nearby -- as well as Huntsville , Ala. , which has a strong concentration of workers in the government and high - tech sectors .
In the end , most of the cities at the top of the lists -- whether they are small , medium or large -- have shown they have what it takes to survive in tough times .
Less - stressed local governments will be able to construct needed infrastructure and attract new investors so that job growth can rise to the levels of past years .
If better days are in the offing , these areas seem best positioned to be the next drivers of the economic expansion this nation sorely needs .

GIMP is the favorite graphics editing program of many designers and graphic artists .
It is free and compatible with Windows , Mac and Linux ( the two big reasons for its popularity ) .
It has a wide array of features , as well as plug-ins , filters and brushes .
Documentation is primarily available in online communities , as well as through extensive add - ons .
[ Updated May/02/2017 ]
GIMP was never designed to replace Photoshop , yet with every release , it comes a little closer to being able to do so .
It can be used to author graphics , create logos and edit photos , as well as make short animations ( using GAP ) .
Despite these features , the open - source app is a foreign world for many users switching from Photoshop .
Familiar tools are missing , menus are laid out differently and tasks must be accomplished in unknown ways .
In this article , we list eight tweaks to make GIMP a more serious Photoshop replacement option .
Version 2.6 was used to test the following tweaks , but past versions of the app should work as well .
Installing Plug - Ins , Brushes and Filters
Before continuing , you need to know how to install add - ons .
It ’s very simple to do , and takes little time .
You ’ll find three different folders in the application ’s program folder .
The location of the application folder depends on the operating system you use .
Go to Edit > Preferences >
Folders to see all folders .
To install a brush or plug - in , copy and paste it into the appropriate folder and restart GIMP .
1 . Add the PSPI Plug-In
The PSPI plug - in allows GIMP to use Photoshop plug-ins .
This increases the number of filters available to GIMP and allows Photoshop users to not have to sacrifice their library .
If an equivalent GIMP plug - in ca n’t be found , assembling a kit of Photoshop filters is a potential option .
To start , download the PSPI plug - in from Gimp.org
In the program folder , copy and paste the entire contents of the PSPI plug - in download into the Plug -ins folder .
If you ’re running Linux , make sure you copy both the PSPI plug - in and the PSPI .
exe , or it will not work .
Restart GIMP and open the Filters menu .
At the bottom , you will see a new entry : “ Photoshop Filters Plug - In Settings . ”
Select that to open the Photoshop dialog box , and point it to the folder where your Photoshop plug-ins are located .
Add all future Photoshop plug-ins to that folder .
2. Install Layer Styles
Layer Styles are a beloved feature of many Photoshop users , and living without them can be a difficult adjustment .
Layer Styles are called Layer Effects in GIMP and include : Drop Shadow , Inner Glow , Outer Glow , Gradient Overlay , Stroke , Bevel and Emboss , etc .
These can be used to quickly apply effects to your layer (s ) without having to jump through hoops .
Download the Layer Effects GIMP plug - in from Gimp.org .
There are two versions : Script - Fu and Python .
The Python version allows for live previews of the effects ; the Script - Fu version does not .
No matter which version you choose , save the plug - in in GIMP ’s Plug - in folder and restart the program .
If you download the Python version , Layer Effects will be added under Layer > Layer Effects .
The Script - Fu version will be listed under Script - Fu > Layer Effects .
3. Add CMYK Color Separation
CMYK stands for cyan , magenta , yellow , key ( black ) .
In the context of photo editors and graphics programs , it is a subtractive color model that is different from the commonly used , additive RGB color model .
In simplified terms , RGB colors work by becoming lighter with the addition of white , while CMYK colors subtract the white by overlaying colors , eventually resulting in black ; that black is n’t as deep as it should be for printing , so black is added to the CMYK mix .
Many users complain about GIMP ’s lack of CMYK support .
For many designers and photographers , images have to be converted to CMYK colors for high - quality prints .
If you require CMYK separation , download the plug - in Separate + from Yellowmagic .
Save the ZIP file , extract the plug - in to the GIMP plug - in folder , then restart the program .
The new feature will be located in the Image menu .
4. Install Liquid Rescale
Liquid Rescale is a favorite of many users and created quite a buzz when first introduced into Photoshop .
Liquid Rescale makes it possible to alter an image ’s dimensions from , for example , 16:9 to 4:3 without distortion by eliminating unnecessary pixels in certain areas .
This process , known most commonly as seam carving , allows you to resize a narrow photo to widescreen format without stretching the content into a morphed , twisted mess .
To add the Liquid Rescale feature to GIMP , download the plug - in from Wikidot and copy it into the GIMP Plug - In folder .
Restart the program .
5. Add Essential Brushes
GIMP comes with far too few brushes ; and the ones that are there are small , basic and not all useful .
If you ’re planning to author graphics , you ’ll need a new library of brushes to accomplish anything .
Installing brushes in GIMP is as simple as copying the brush file into the Brush folder and restarting GIMP .
Brushes can be downloaded from numerous locations , depending on what you ’re looking for .
That said , an excellent repository of free brushes of all types – including grunge , fire , splatter , stone and more – is at DeviantArt .
If you add the largest brushes available , you can scale the features in GIMP to reduce their size , allowing for high - resolution graphics .
6. Anchor Windows
If you were to ask Photoshop users their biggest dislike about GIMP , they would almost unanimously express a disdain for the loose docks and toolbars .
The canvas , toolbar and layers , paths and brushes dock are all free - floating and scattered about the desktop .
If you have a decent window manager , this is a benefit ; for most users , it ’s a hindrance .
If the loose docks in GIMP bother you , go to Windows > Single - Window Mode .
If you still are n’t satisfied with the window system , two different versions of GIMP are available that have interfaces similar to Photoshop ’s : GIMPshop and GimPhoto .
GimPhoto has a slightly more appealing interface , but GIMPshop is based on a newer version of GIMP .
7. Install Animation Package
The GIMP Animation Package , known as GAP , allows users to create animations .
The most common use of GAP is for animated GIFs and avatars ; but it is sophisticated enough to make full - episode animations , surrealistic landscapes and realistic water motion .
GAP is not automatically included in GIMP .
It can be downloaded from an ever - changing number of locations .
Mac users can find a download and instructions at GAP - Systems .
Windows users have dozens of mirrors to choose from , and a fresh Internet search will yield the best results .
Finally , Linux users can download GAP by running a gimp - gap install in the terminal or , if you ’re on Ubuntu , searching gimp - gap in the Synaptic packages .
8. Enable GEGL
GEGL is a new feature found only in GIMP 2.6+.
According to Gimp.org :
“ Many highly requested features of the GIMP will be easier to do using GEGL .
Layer effects , layer groups , and adjustment layers are quite easily represented ( and efficiently calculated ) using the DAG organization of GEGL .
CMYK and high bit depth support will be easier because GEGL does not make the same assumptions about color spaces and data types that the GIMP does . ”
You can use the presets available at Tools > GEGL Operations .
Approximately a dozen different presets can be applied to layers and images .
Conclusion
These tweaks , plug-ins and add - ons push GIMP closer to its full potential .
While it still would n’t replace Photoshop as the top graphics program , it will stand a step higher and provide features that would otherwise be missing .
In addition to the add - ons above , a great deal more can be added to customize GIMP to your own personal needs , including HDR plug-ins , photo cleaners , scrapbook borders and animation effects for GAP .
New features are added to the GIMP registry everyday .
In addition , if you ca n’t find a plug - in to meet your needs , you can write your own plug - in script .

The leader of the Three Franciscos , a ring accused of transporting more than 9,000 illegal immigrants through Los Angeles and around the country , was sentenced to six years in federal prison Monday .
Federal officials called the organization the most prolific of its kind ever uncovered in Los Angeles , collecting fees as high as $ 3,700 from relatives of immigrants who were packed into cramped vans and safe houses .
“ We estimated they were moving about 100 a week , ” said Jennifer Silliman , deputy special agent in charge of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Los Angeles .
The group was known as the Three Franciscos because all three of the operators had the same first name .
“ They were n’t using the best vehicles .
Not everyone had seat belts .
A lot of times the vehicles were old , or they got in an accident ” Silliman added .
“ They were essentially overloaded . ”

On Monday , Francisco Andres - Francisco , 40 , was sentenced in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles .
In November , he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to harbor , conceal and transport illegal immigrants .
Another leader of the organization , Francisco Andres - Pedro , 36 , was previously sentenced to 33 months in prison .
The third man , Francisco Pedro - Francisco , 30 , remains a fugitive .
Federal agents say Andres - Francisco was the main boss of the operation .
Like the other two , he is from Huehuetenango in Guatemala .
Together they built a well - oiled organization that by conservative estimates made at least $ 9 million since 2005 transporting mainly Guatemalans and other Central Americans .
The group came to the attention of federal agents in 2005 after the LAPD found 146 illegal immigrants in two safe houses in South Los Angeles .
The smuggling ring allegedly picked up immigrants who had crossed the border in Arizona , held them in drop houses in Los Angeles and Lancaster and then drove them in vans and SUVs to New Jersey , Tennessee and Illinois .

Smugglers typically confiscated immigrants ’ shoes to keep them from running away , and the windows of the safe houses were boarded up .
Two men who authorities said acted as guards were illegal immigrants trying to pay off their debts .
The organization had connections as far as Ecuador .
The hired drivers went through the underworld equivalent of a quick internship , going on dry runs with illegal immigrants to test their mettle .
The leaders meticulously calculated the cost of trips and expected drivers to pay back money that was not used , according to a federal affidavit .

During cross-country trips that often went to the East Coast , smugglers gave the immigrants little to eat so that they would not have to go to the bathroom .
In 2007 , one of the group ’s minivans crashed in Phoenix , throwing 10 immigrants from the vehicle , with some of them suffering crushed internal organs and brain hemorrhaging .
Virginia Kice , an ICE spokeswoman , said that people who smuggle illegal immigrants often demand more money from relatives than what was agreed on .
“ These are n’t people who are trying to help people , ” she said .
“ They ’re in it for one reason and one reason only : for profit .
They do everything they can to maximize their return .
To them , these people are cargo . ”

Andres - Francisco , the most influential of the group ’s three leaders , was arrested last year in Pennsylvania while driving a van loaded with immigrants .
Kice said it was relatively unusual for the leaders to do the transporting themselves .
“ But sometimes managers in an organization have to do work too , ” she said .

A book which the Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez presented to US President Barack Obama at the Americas summit has become a bestseller in just two days .
The book , Open Veins of Latin America : Five Centuries of the Pillage of a Continent , was ranked 54,295 on the sales charts of bookseller Amazon.com .
Now , it has risen to number two .
Written by Uruguayan author Eduardo Galeano , the book looks at the impact of foreign intervention in Latin America in the past five centuries .
It covers the continent 's conquest by the Spanish nearly 500 years ago right up to the present day .
President Chavez presented his American counterpart with the book , a favourite of leftists , on the sidelines of the Summit of the Americas in Trinidad on Saturday .
' Nice gesture '
President Obama looked surprised when Mr Chavez got up from his seat , handed him the book and then shook his hand .
It was a Spanish - language paperback copy inscribed with the message : " For Obama , with affection " .
A little later , Mr Obama had this reaction : " Well I think it was a nice gesture to give me a book .
I 'm a reader . "
However , for President Chavez it was a serious matter .
" This book is a monument in our Latin American history .
It allows us to learn history , and we have to build on this history , " the Venezuelan leader told reporters at the summit .
It is not the first time Mr Chavez 's choice of reading matter has given authors a boost , the BBC's Greg Morsbach reports .
His speech at the United Nations three years ago helped to revive the fortunes of the American intellectual , Noam Chomsky .
Mr Chomsky 's title , Hegemony or Survival : America 's Quest for Global Dominance , became the number one bestseller on Amazon after a plug from Mr Chavez during his address .
Bookshops in the US and Europe sold out of copies within days .
Tens of thousands more copies were ordered in from the publishers .
During the height of New York City ’s financial crisis in the 1970’s , President Gerald Ford had the good sense to turn down Mayor Abe Beame ’s request for a federal bailout .
The refusal prompted the famous New York Post headline ,  Ford to City : Drop Dead . 
More than 30 years later , as California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger makes a similar plea to Washington , I hope President Obama will show similar restraint .
Unfortunately , given Obama ’s recent string of unwise economic decisions , it ’s hard to imagine that his judgment will suddenly improve .
A federal bailout would spare California from having to make spending cuts needed to bring its budget into balance .
The matter has become urgent since California voters rejected several tax - hiking ballot initiatives .
Rather than taking the vote as a signal to dramatically curtail spending , the state turned to the feds .
If they get a free pass , the politicians can avoid fixing any of their past mistakes or preparing California for the future .
California , like many states , expended its bureaucracy as the nation ’s bubble economy inflated .
When condos flipped like hamburgers and homeowners flush with equity spent like lottery winners , extra tax revenue flooded into Sacramento .
However , instead of saving the money for a rainy day or paying off prior debts , the state government simply ballooned its spending .
Now that the bubble has burst , and revenues are severely depleted , it is time for California to reconsider its excesses .
Governor Schwarzenegger ’s claim that a federal guarantee is not a bailout is ludicrous .
No one in the private sector will lend California any money because the state can’t pay it back .
Just like AIG and GM , it needs federal help to stay solvent .
And although the Federal balance sheet is in far worse shape than California ’s , there is one crucial difference : Washington has a printing press , and Sacramento does not .
With the ability to pay off debts with newly created funds , a federal default is not a concern .
However , if Obama comes to the rescue , none of the needed cuts will be made .
Instead , California will continue to operate its bloated bureaucracy and will be in constant need of more bailouts .
In other words , if Schwarzenegger gets his bailout , look for him to utter his famous line —  I ’ll be back . 
But it ’s not just Schwarzenegger who will be back , but governors from all the other states as well .
After all , if the Federal government bails out California , by what right can they deny similar aid to other states ?
The bailout will send a clear message that states do not need to cut spending .
Similar to the reckless behavior that resulted from federally guaranteed mortgages , federal guarantees on state debt will counteract the market ’s attempt to force states to act responsibly .
As the market accurately prices - in the heightened risk of default , California faces staggering increases in its borrowing cost .
Under normal circumstances , this pressure would force the state to act prudently now to diminish the risk of a future default .
However , by allowing California to evade the bond market vigilantes ,  the stage will be set for much bigger losses .
The moral hazards created by state bailouts are tremendous .
With federal guarantees given to profligate states , those states that had shown greater fiscal responsibility will face higher interest rates — as their bonds lack a federal guarantee .
This creates the perverse incentive for all states to act irresponsibly .
Just as government - guaranteed mortgages lead the market to make overly risky home loans , federally guaranteed state obligations will set the stage for yet another crisis .
Federal backing of California bonds would effectively turn them into Treasury bonds , with the added appeal of being exempt from California state income tax .
Therefore , the Treasury will be at a competitive disadvantage when it looks to issue its own debt to Californians .
If it then has to guarantee the bonds of all the other 50 states , why would any Americans buy Treasuries when they can get identical credit quality on better terms from the states ?
The only real buyers left would be foreigners , who are already queasy about the Treasuries they own .
Crash Proof 2.0 : How t... Peter D. Schiff Best Price : $ 1.50 Buy New $ 3.97 ( as of 10:46 EST - Details )
The need to make good on state and federal obligations will further depress the appeal of all U.S. dollar - denominated debt .
As a result , as real buyers flee the market , the Fed will have to run its printing presses even faster to pick up the slack .
This will set into motion a self - perpetuating spiral of money printing and Treasury sales with a predictable result : hyperinflation .
In the meantime , by redirecting credit to California that otherwise would have gone to more credit - worthy borrowers , the government will worsen the credit crunch for the rest of the country .
Since there is only a finite supply of credit , money borrowed by California will no longer be available to other borrowers .
The effect is a less efficient allocation of capital that further undermines national productivity .
The only rational policy choice for Obama is to send Schwarzenegger packing .
If he does , California will have no choice but to cut spending or default on its bonds .
My guess is that , with their backs to the wall , the California legislature will choose the former .
However , even if they default , at least the losses will be borne by those who freely assumed the risks .
With a bailout , the losses will be shouldered by those who were not even parties to the transactions .
If we go this route , we can all say hasta la vista , baby  to our prosperity .

The Best of Peter Schiff
When an irritant such as dust is inhaled ... the respiratory tract which has a mucous membrane lining will secrete substances which the dust will settle into and stick to ...
Mucous is the common term for this substance when it is in the Upper respiratory tract .
The Mucous will eventually be swept away as post nasal dripping , into the oropharynx ( back of the throat ) and will be swallowed throughout the day along with saliva , food , and drinks that we consume .
Our GI tract will then expell it with our waste in the bowel movements .
Sputum is the common term for the substance whe it is in the lower bronchial tree and lungs .
Our bronchial tree has fine hairs the help sweep things along .
We are also equiped with a cough reflex .
So as we cough , this sputum from the deeper portion of our respiratory tract will be brought forth to the oropharynx ( back of throat ) where it will be swallowed involuntarily .
We do this without even thinking about it .
We never taste it because it does not reach the tongue .
Good Luck

The dangers of inhaling dubious facts
I ’VE been called a traitor , ” says Michael Siegel , a public - health doctor at Boston University in Massachusetts .
“ It ’s been a character assassination . ”
This treatment seems surprising as , reading Siegel ’s CV , you ’d think he was a poster boy for the anti-smoking movement .
He regularly publishes research on the harmful effects of passive smoking and has testified in support of indoor smoking bans in more than 50 US cities .
Despite these credentials , Siegel has come under fire from colleagues in the field of smoking research .
His offence was to post messages on the widely read mailing list Tobacco Policy Talk , in which he questioned one of the medical claims about passive smoking , as well as the wisdom of extreme measures such as outdoor smoking bans .
In front of his peers , funders and potential future employers , other contributors posted messages accusing Siegel of taking money from the tobacco industry .
When Siegel stood his ground , the administrators kicked him off the list , cutting off a key source of news in his field .
“ It felt like I was excommunicated , says Siegel .
“ I was shocked : I ’ve been a leader in the movement for 21 years . ”
Siegel ’s case is perhaps the most clear - cut example of a disturbing trend in the anti-smoking movement .
There are genuine scientific questions over some of the more extreme claims made about the dangers of passive smoking and the best strategies to reduce smoking rates , …
It takes more than one measure to change established behaviour .
I HATE to spoil the fun , but do you mind if I introduce a note of rationality into the hysteria surrounding the alcopops tax ?
Would it be naive to mention that there 's a vast body of evidence about how people 's behaviour can be modified ?
If we 're serious about discouraging binge drinking , we know roughly what to do .
Forget shock - horror advertising , for a start .
If you want to change the way people behave , you need to make significant changes to the environment that shapes their behaviour .
And there 's never just one magic solution : you 'll have to do several things at once if you want to exert the pressure needed to upset established patterns of behaviour .
When , as a society , we decided to discourage people from smoking , we did as many things as we could to make it harder and less attractive to smoke .
We raised prices ( via taxes ) so high that smoking became a seriously expensive habit .
We severely restricted the areas where people can smoke .
We banned the overt marketing of cigarettes , issued dire health warnings attached to cigarette packs and increased the weight of anti-smoking propaganda .
Job losses continue to mount in every state across the country , show new data released today by the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
Employers have laid off 4.4 million workers since the recession began , and a record 12.5 million workers are now unemployed .
All but one state — Nebraska — saw a month - over - month increase in unemployment in February .
The typical state ’s unemployment rate is 3.1 percentage points above where it was in February 2008 .
Michigan continues to have the highest unemployment rate in the nation at 12.0 percent , followed by South Carolina ( 11.0 percent ) , Oregon ( 10.8 percent ) , North Carolina ( 10.7 percent ) , and Rhode Island and California ( 10.5 percent ) .
February ’s unemployment rate was above 7 percent in 31 of 50 states as well as in the District of Columbia .
In February , nonfarm payroll employment decreased in all but one state — Louisiana — as well as in the District of Columbia .
The figure above shows cumulative job losses in each state , relative to the highest employment level reached since 2000 in each state .
Six states ( Illinois , Indiana , Massachusetts , Michigan , Mississippi , and Ohio ) never recovered to the peak employment levels of 2000 or 2001 , and so job changes are shown relative to that peak .
For all other states , job losses are measured to their peak employment in 2007 or 2008 ( click on the state to see the month and year of the employment peak ) .
The largest cumulative job losses in February occurred in California , where employers laid off 116,000 employees ( 0.8 percent of their workforce ) .
The sharpest job losses as a percent of the state ’s total workforce occurred in Oregon , where employers laid off 1.3 percent of their employees over the past month , followed by Arizona and Washington where employers shed 1.0 percent of their workforce .
High unemployment has led to sustained high numbers of applicants for unemployment benefits nationwide .
The four - week moving average — the weekly average number of new applicants for unemployment benefits over the previous four weeks — was 649,000 last week and continues to be at levels not seen since the recession in the early 1980s .
Many unemployed workers are finding that getting a new job is increasingly difficult .
Nearly one in four unemployed workers ( 23.1 percent ) have been out of work and searching for a job for at least six months , up from less than one in five ( 17.3 percent ) a year ago .
And 3.4 million workers over the past year ran out of unemployment benefits before they found a new job .
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allows states with high unemployment ( above 6.5 percent ) to provide an additional 13 to 20 weeks of unemployment benefits , fully paid for by the federal government .
However , states need to authorize spending and only half have done so .
If the remaining states do not act , then over half a million ( 567,000 ) jobless Americans will exhaust their federal unemployment benefits in the next few weeks .
Sixty percent of workers who have become unemployed over the past 12 months have not received any unemployment benefits .
For more information on the percentage of workers not getting benefits now , and on the Unemployment Insurance Modernization Act , see the Center for American Progress Action Fund ’s Half in Ten report , “ Helping the Jobless Helps Us All . ”

There is something seductive about pressing the shutter and capturing a moment out of life or a fleeting glimpse of the grandeur of nature that does n't diminish with the passage of time .
During my life I have created many images of what I have seen .
Different people can look in the same direction and see very different things .
By presenting my images to others I 'm saying " See this object or landscape the way I saw it . "
I hope what I have seen and created is interesting to others .
Indeed , it is gratifying when others enjoy my images .
However , I enjoy the creative process as much as anything else because it helps me to process and remember .
I can't imagine going through life and not creating images .
Less than a week after declaring that the new Israeli government did not consider itself bound by the Annapolis Conference commitment to a two - state solution with the Palestinians , Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman today declared that all peace talks with the Palestinians were “ at a dead end . ”
Minister Lieberman also cautioned foreign powers to “ not interfere ” in Israeli affairs , seen by some as a reference to President Barack Obama ’s comments yesterday in favor of a two - state solution .
He insisted that Israel has “ never interfered in the affairs of others , and we expect from others that they not interfere in ours . ”
Speaking at the convention of his Yisrael Beiteinu party , Lieberman declared that most of the world had come to accept his ideas , and that the only people who take issue with them are Israeli leftists .
His party gained enormously in this year ’s elections , on the back of Lieberman ’s pro-war statements and the demand that Arabs take loyalty oaths or lose their citizenship .
A bizarre car crash in Newport Beach involving two luxury cars early this morning left one person dead , a second injured , a third arrested for gross vehicular manslaughter and a fourth person was detained by police .
An acquaintance of the victim identified him as Charles " Mask " Lewis , co-founder of the mixed - martial - arts apparel company TapouT , which also sponsors fighters .
He was pronounced dead at the scene .
A Newport Beach Police Department officer who witnessed the wreck and saw a red Ferrari and a white Porsche " spinning out of control " on Jamboree Road between Bison Avenue and East Bluff Drive at 12:57 a.m. , Newport Beach Lt. Craig Fox said .
The Ferrari " hit the curb and then collided with a pole . "
The Porsche came to a stop at the scene for a few seconds and then sped away , Fox said .
" It was terrible .
It was extensive damage to the vehicle , " Fox said , adding that the Ferrari appeared to have split in half .
Since this article was originally published back in 2009 , special effects photography has become far more accessible to the average photographer due to the march of technology .
Now , even back then , we wrote that “ many of the techniques that required a large investment in equipment only a few years ago , can now be replicated using a good digital editing program on a home computer . ”
That sentiment is even more accurate these days .
But where do you start to learn the techniques ?
First up , you need to narrow down what you ’re trying to learn or achieve in your photos .
Below are some suggestions regarding more popular special effects photography techniques that you can start with .
This list of tutorials from tilt shift photography through to HDR will hopefully show you that the world of special effects photography is not outside the bounds of the average amateur .
In fact , a rich world of photo experimentation is right at the hands of anyone who has a camera , a computer , some patience and the willingness to learn something new .
What Exactly Are Photo Special Effects ?
When it comes to photography , the term “ special effects ” covers a very wide gamut of photography effects .
The very nature of rendering even an ordinary photo could be argued to be a special effect for the simple reason that it is not a 100 % accurate representation of what the human eye saw at the time ( despite thousands of optical engineers trying to take things in that direction for the last century ) .
Any image is interpreted by the creator – a raw file captured according to the inputs of optical and software engineers , a jpg image interpreted by camera settings and those same engineers , or an image worked on in post production by a photographer .
But for the purposes of this article , we ’re going to restrict ourselves to some of the more popular effects that many people understand to fall under the umbrella of special effects .
Namely , we will take a look at light painting , tilt shift photography , HDR photography , lomography and infrared photography .
If there is a subset of special effects that you would like us to cover , then let us know in the comments and we will update the article over time .
For now though , let ’s jump into it .
Light Painting Tutorials
Of all special effects photography techniques , the one that is probably the most instantly accessible to the average photographer is light painting .
It ’s probably also the technique with the most potential to create a wide gamut of image styles and take you from the ordinary to the spectacular quickly .
Take a look at some of these amazing examples of light painting :

Now , if you ’re interested in taking shots like these , we recommend taking a look at our in - depth course on the topic which dives very deep on this technique .
In the meantime , here are some tutorials to get your started with light painting :
Tilt Shift Photography Tutorials
Tilt shift photography produces images that look almost like miniature model scenes by altering depth of field and perspective .
In fact , when you first see tilt shift images , you could be forgiven for thinking that you are looking at a scene from a model railway .
Photo by David McBee
Now , this special effect does ideally require some gear because you need to control where your lens ’ “ imaging circle ” interacts with your camera ’s sensor , but there are certain ways to “ hack ” your way to the effect without spending a dime .
Here are some very useful tilt shift photography tutorials that will get you started :
Lomo Photography ( Lomography ) Tutorials
Lomo photography had a massive worldwide following due to the success of the original Russian state - run LOMO PLC which produced the LOMO LC - A Compact Automat Camera in the early 1980s .
The camera produced a unique and recognizable hue and blur to the images in took and soon became a photophic cult favourite .
Photo by Laura Boccola
Of course , since that time , the popularity of Lomography has meant that it has been emulated digitally by thousands of apps and artists .
And while its popularity has fallen away these last few years , it still has thousands of adherents .
If this style takes your fancy , then here are some great places to start learning how to do it for yourself .
HDR Photography Tutorials
HDR or High Dynamic
Range photography produces remarkably striking and colorful images that enjoyed massive popularity for a few years .
More recently , the bright and saturated HDR fad tended to fall away in its original form to be replaced with slightly more subdued efforts that still use HDR as their basis , but reign in the over saturated effects of the 2008 - 2013 era .
Image by Rudy and Peter Skitterians
Image by Frank Winkler
At its most basic , the effect involves shooting multiple shots at different exposures and then combining all of those images in post production .
This literally allows a higher dynamic range in the end result than a single photograph is capable of .
Infrared Photography Tutorials
With traditional infrared photography , the film or image sensor had to be sensitive in infrared light .
The human eye is sensitive to light on the visible light spectrum ( between 400 nm and 700 nm ) whereas infrared records light between 700nm and 900nm that is not usually visible to us .
The effects in photography can be quite striking .
Photo by Mick De Paola
It is also possible to achieve the infrared photography effect using only post production ( hence it ’s not technically infrared photography ) so we show tutorials for each .
Final Thoughts
Special effects photography certainly does n’t have to stop with the techniques that we have highlighted .
If you have any type of special effect that you think we should have covered , then leave a note in the comments and we may well add it to this article !
I forgot to post about this last week .
You may remember Neal Horsley when he famously admitted his love of farm animals with Alan Colmes a few years ago .
" Is it true ? " Colmes asked .
" Hey , Alan , if you want to accuse me of having sex when I was a fool , I did everything that crossed my mind that looked like I ... "
AC : " You had sex with animals ? " NH : " Absolutely .
I was a fool .
When you grow up on a farm in Georgia , your first girlfriend is a mule . "
AC : " I 'm not so sure that that is so . "
He is now running for governor in Georgia as a Republican and says that he'd kill his own son for liberty .
I 'm not kidding you .
A longshot Georgia candidate for governor who ’s already admitted having sex with a mule before finding God says he ’s ready to sacrifice his own son in an effort to get his state to secede from the union .
Neal Horsley made national headlines when he posted the names , phone numbers and addresses of abortion doctors online .
His “ Nuremberg Files ” website also crossed off the names of doctors as they were killed .
Now he ’s ready to make new news .
In an interview by Dylan Otto Krider published late Wednesday , he indicated he ’d kill his own son to dissolve the United States ( in an effort to overturn Roe v. Wade ) .
Asked if he was ready to sacrifice his own son in a national insurrection , Horsley recounts a fight with his son where he almost killed him .
“ I was one foot from killing my own son , or hurting him really , really bad , ” Horsley told Krider .
“ If he would have attacked me again , I would have stuck him .
Or cut him or sliced him or done something to stop him .
That ’s the point , you hypothetical has literally already been worked out with me , and that ’s what makes me different from the other candidates for Governor .
I do n't think this is the type of candidate that Republicans intend to now fill their new " Big Tent " party with .
This is where I post the shit I like .
Maybe you 'll like it too .
The baby fleece inspired by kangaroos ... or was it the sci - fi film Total Recall ?
Peekaboo !
A model and baby wear the Peekaru fleece
Toasty warm , with bright little eyes blinking out at the world , this baby is as snug as a joey in the pouch .
And that 's just what the designer of the Peekaru intended .
Melissa Radcliffe , 32 , was inspired by the kangaroo's pouch when looking for a way to keep her baby daughter warm .
However , there is also a certain resemblance to the mutant rebel leader Kuato in the 1990 sci-fi film Total Recall which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sharon Stone .
Towards the end of the movie Kuato is revealed to be part of the body of another character .
Mrs Radcliffe said she came up with the idea while living through freezing winter weather in Denver , Colorado .
The mother of three was fed up with leaving her overcoat undone in the cold weather while carrying the child in a normal baby sling .
' When my oldest son was a toddler , he would play while his newborn sister got very cold in my arms .
' I tried to wear my husband 's jackets to keep us both protected , but I felt ugly and frumpy and it did n't do a very good job , ' she said .
' I looked around and could n't find anything better , so I went home , got on my sewing machine and made it myself . '
Her home - made fleece proved so popular with other mothers that Mrs Radcliffe went into business .
Did inspiration for the fleece come from this scene in the sci- fi film Total Recall or purely from a kangaroo carrying her joey ?
' I got stopped so often by other mothers asking where they could get one that I decided to start making them for real , ' she added .
' Before I did this I could barely even sew - I think I could just about sew a pillow case . '
Her firm now sells the Peekaru in 150 shops worldwide and online .
The company , TogetherBe , has also made waterproof and sunproof versions of the £ 55 fleece which can be used over a forward or backward - facing sling .
' It 's been really wonderful to see people using them and enjoying them , ' said Mrs Radcliffe .
' People say they are exactly what they 've been looking for to protect their kids and I hope we can keep coming up with new ideas . '
No freeze on settlements
Israeli Prime Minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , stated on Thursday that Israel does not intend to freeze the expansion and construction of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank .
The statements of Netanyahu came during a meeting with the Czech Prime Minister , Mirek Topolanek .
The Czech Republic is the rotating head of the European Union .
The Israeli PM said that this issue should be parallel , stating the ? if the Israeli?s were barred from building in the West Bank , the Palestinians should refrain from building too ?.
This position disregards the fact that settlements in the occupied West Bank are illegal under the international law and constitute a war crime .
Topolanek told Netanyahu that the European Union is concerned that the ongoing construction and expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank would hinder the establishment of an independent , contiguous Palestinian state .
Netanyahu said that the ?
West Bank is a disputed territory ?
and that he does not intend to halt the construction and expansion of settlements .
He stated that Israel does not currently plan to expand settlements , but added that ?
if a settler wants to build a home in a settlement , then there is no problem in that ?
although it will ?
enforce the law in dealing with illegal settlement outposts ? , also referred to by Israel as ?random outpost ?.
He slammed some European Legislators who are saying the EU should not upgrade its relations with Israel because of its violations against the Palestinians .
Netanyahu stated that relations with Israel should not be dependent on Israel ?s relations with the Palestinians , and added that Israel will not accept preconditions .
The statements of Netanyahu come in direct contradiction to international law especially since Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank are built on areas stolen from the Palestinian .

Darwin in Turkey ' Most Express Sympathy for the Censorship '
The firing of a magazine editor in Turkey over her intention to put a story about Darwin 's evolution theory on the cover has generated a flood of criticism .
SPIEGEL ONLINE spoke with the editor about just how conservative Turkish society has become .
The Israel Government Tourism Office is withdrawing a series of posters displayed in London Underground stations featuring a map that treats the occupied territories as part of Israel , after the advertisements were referred to the Advertising Standards Authority .
The yellow map makes no distinction between Israel and the Golan Heights , the West Bank and Gaza .
The Palestinian Solidarity Campaign and Jews for Justice for Palestinians both complained to the ASA as well as to CBS Outdoor , which is responsible for the poster sites , and Transport for London ( TfL ) , which said it received more than 600 complaints .
The poster , which had gone up on 108 sites and was due to go up on another 42 before it was pulled by IGTO , was part of the Think Israel campaign .
Last year the ASA upheld a complaint about a magazine advertisement that was part of the same campaign because it implied that Qumran was in the state of Israel when in fact it is in the occupied West Bank .
In its judgement , the ASA ruled that the advert should be withdrawn and said it was " concerned by ThinkIsrael.coms [ sic ] lack of response and apparent disregard for the [ committee of advertising practice ] code " .
An ASA spokesman said it had received 342 complaints about the London Underground posters and it was currently assessing whether there were grounds for an investigation .
He said the fact that the posters were being withdrawn would be taken into consideration but did not preclude an investigation .
A TfL spokesman said : " The Israel Ministry of Tourism has requested the removal of an advert that they had placed at selected stations on the Tube network . "
Neither the Israeli embassy in London or IGTO responded to theguardian.com requests for a comment .
Carole Regan , who is on the executive of the PSC , said : " It 's not just insensitive , it 's quite provocative .
We are quite angry about it . "
Dan Judelson , from JfJfP , said he thought the IGTO had been " stupid " to create such a poster so soon after the British airline BMI came under fire for omitting Israeli cities from electronic maps on flights from London to Tel Aviv .
On that occasion , BMI blamed the previous owner of the planes for bowing to Arab sensitivities .
" It 's absurd to behave in the same way [ as BMI ] .
Maps are far from innocent tools , " said Judelson .
The Syrian embassy also complained to TfL and CBS Outdoor , as well as to the Mayor of London and the UK Foreign Office , over the inclusion of the Golan Heights , seized from Syria in the 1967 six - day war and unilaterally annexed by Israel in 1981 .
" It 's an outrageous falsification of the facts and a violation of international law , " said embassy spokesman Jihad Makdissi .
" We have reminded everyone of the legal aspect as well as the moral aspect . "

Travelling to Hay - on - Wye last weekend on one of the most beautiful days in recent years , it was difficult to comprehend the disasters that we read about every day .
The landscape was resplendent ; I passed a fete with several elderly men in Panama hats stooped over cake and plant stands , cyclists , anglers , ramblers in the Golden Valley , people pottering in gardens - it was Britain of a 1950s lithograph with a Morris Minor Traveller somewhere in the foreground , an image that still lurks in our idea of the country and what it stands for .
Granted , things are quite different in the crime hot spots of Peckham , Moss Side and Westminster but it 's worth remembering that a lot of national life is not in upheaval and that most institutions are untouched by scandal .
Britain is still a remarkably peaceful place with a canny and humorous population that is never better represented than by that audience at Hay signalling disapproval and interest with the shrewdness of buyers at a country livestock market .
In these moments , when we appear to be in some kind of national crisis and are at the same time called upon to vote as Britons in an election held in the huge , largely mysterious aggregation of 27 states , and when there is something presuming to call itself the British National party , we begin to fret over our national identity .
Worries that Britain has somehow lost its specialness prompt frantic definitions of Britishness and Britain 's values , all of which seem to meet with universal lack of success .
Britain is best defined in the negative - it is easier to say what we are not , rather than what we are .
And on the principle that the truest line is always the one drawn quickest , I want to lasso a few examples from the news to say what we are not .
We are not by any means a corrupt nation , despite the tormenting series of revelations in the Daily Telegraph , which by now seem less heroic than the average pest control operation .
Nor are we a pitiless people although the state acting in the name of British interest over the last 100 years has made some heartless blunders ( the Cossacks forcibly returned to the USSR from Austria in 1945 , the suppression of the Mau Mau , the H - Blocks in Ulster ) .
We are not an angry nation though once riled , as now , we tend to be unforgiving , and we do not easily forget .
We are not , despite our convictions to the contrary , a particularly democratic nation .
If we were , we would have insisted on proportional representation long ago .
We like our governments to get on with it and decide most things for us even if they represent a minority of voters .
We often fail to see governments and politicians for what they are .
And we are not radicals , a fact that may disappoint those - including me - that argue for a written constitution and reform of the political system .
We fondly think of ourselves as hospitable and open to new influences .
But on the evidence of new laws that ban artists , musicians and academics from visiting Britain without certificates of sponsorship , we are not .
When a Newfoundland - based singer Allison Crowe and two of her band members , Billie Woods and Laurent Boucher , arrived at Gatwick to tour Britain they were arrested , held in cells , photographed and fingerprinted and had their passports stamped " Barred from Entry " before being returned to Canada .
This shocking and disgraceful treatment - designed to exclude illegal immigrants and terrorists - seems fundamentally unBritish .
The English National Opera and Southbank have both had problems bringing in foreign performers because of the stringent requirement for non-EU citizens to provide biometrics and photographs and submit to controls over their day - to - day activity while here .
Is this Britain ?
If so , the rational half of our brain has been overwhelmed by " suspicion and parochialism " , in the words of the staunchly sensible Manifesto Club , which has started a petition against the laws brought in by immigration minister Phil Woolas .
We are not , surely , the censorious nation that seems to insist that a 39 - year - old artist , Helen Gorrill , applies to the police for their judgment on her work at the suggestion of the University of Cumbria .
The drawings for her degree show , which reverses the female submissiveness advocated by a religious pamphlet posted through her door , put women in a dominant position while the men are bound and bent in sexual submission .
The male figures have been censored but to protect whom ?
The spam I receive contains more indecency than Ms Gorrill 's work .
And it is much less interesting because she makes a valid point .
I recently spent a day at a school talking to a succession of English classes about storytelling and writing books .
Before doing so I was asked to wear a " health and safety badge " as part of some idiotic government regulation .
I did n't wear the badge but the school and pupils seem to have survived .
Later this year when new vetting procedures come in such behaviour will no doubt be read as a sign of paedophilia .
From October the Independent Safeguarding Authority will require anyone working with children to join a register at a cost of £ 63 , and submit to ongoing checks , at which point the parent volunteers , the scout masters , the college maths students , the authors , music tutors and children 's entertainers will find something else to do with their time .
Our children will be less instructed and less rounded and adults will miss the sort of experience I had just a few days ago .
Britishness appears now to include either a failure to apprehend what is in front of our noses , or a degree of suspicion that is tremendously unhealthy .
I prefer to think it is the first .
We have allowed things to be done in our name that defy common sense and would disturb us if we spent half a moment considering their impact .
Complacency ?
Well , no .
Inattention seems to be a prevailing British trait at the moment , which explains why the institutions that have been exposed these last few months have been allowed to get away with so many irregularities for so long .
Orwell reflected on the indifference of the British at the end of the war .
" I do n't know whether this semi- anaesthesia in which the British people contrive to live is a sign of decadence , as many observers believe , or whether on the other hand it is a kind of instinctive wisdom . "
But the British are not stoical , as they were during the war .
The aversion to risk is one of the most notable parts of the national character - we believe that it 's possible to eliminate all danger by laws and regulations .
Official action in all three stories mentioned here was designed to meet the public 's desire to be protected from unseen , or poorly assessed threats .
The serene forgetfulness that you imagine passing through the countryside on a beautiful day is an illusion .
To be sure many may have this wisdom that Orwell spoke of - the sense that these things pass and it does n't pay to get too worked up - but the important point which I accept reluctantly is that we are where we are now because of the way we are now .
The deterioration of police behaviour , the lunacy of the banking industry , these dodgy MPs and their regime of petty , fearful laws are a product of one or other parts of the British character .
These things do not just happen : the responsibility is ours .
WonderCon 2008 : The Three Best Things Brendan Fraser Said While on Cold Medication
Brendan Fraser appeared at at a Q&A at WonderCon on Friday to shill for Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D and to wow the audience with his bizarre behavior and loose grip on basic mathematical concepts .
No explanation was offered for his bug - eyed antics and often laborious , meandering tangents , but many chalked up the episode to the influence of powerful cold medication .
I mean , I assume it was cold medication .
It sure was n’t a bad dose of Propecia making him behave so strangely .
If you know what I ’m sayin’ .
3 ) In response to a question about his favorite movies among the work he ’s done :
I think Gods and Monsters was an important movie .
Fair enough .
I mean , “ important ” is a bit pretentious , but I do n’t want to jump to any conclusions about how misguidedly - enormous your ego might be …
I also think The Quiet American was an important movie .
Ok .
Yeah .
Methinks you should consider switching up your medication to a dose of humility filled with Airheads , laced with Bedazzled , and washed down with some Dudley Do-Right .
Ok , Encino Man ?
Christ .
But those two gems were just a warm - up for the main event of What the hell is he talking about ?
( E-mail subscribers and RSS readers , visit the post to view the video . )
That ’s right : Fraser ’s cold has swelled his head to a point where he thinks that George of the Jungle is an honest - to - Jesus pop culture phenomenon .
Sure .
Right up there with the Flowbee .
2 ) Here ’s a perfectly reasonable thing to say :
I publicly apologize for Monkeybone .
Reasonable … unless you immediately follow it with this :
( E-mail subscribers and RSS readers , visit the post to see the video . )
Creepiest .
Cackle .
Ever .
In case you were wondering … no , no one else got the , uh … joke .
I think it ’s fair to say everyone in attendance was too preoccupied with their concern over his mental health .
1 ) In response to an audience member asking for advice for aspiring actors :
When I asked for that same advice when I was in training in Seattle , I asked the same question .
I got a one word answer .
Well … two .
Well … three : ‘ Have courage . ’
Ha !
Thank you , Brendan Fraser , talented elocutionist and ninja mathematician .

Sugars and caffeine in cola are probably to blame Excessive cola consumption can lead to anything from mild weakness to profound muscle paralysis , doctors are warning .
This is because the drink can cause blood potassium to drop dangerously low , they report in the International Journal of Clinical Practice .
They tell of the curious case of an Australian ostrich farmer who needed emergency care for lung paralysis after drinking 4 - 10 litres of cola a day .
He made a full recovery and was advised to curtail his cola drinking .
We have every reason to think that it is not rare
Dr Clifford Packer from the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Centre in Ohio Another example included a pregnant woman who regularly consumed up to three litres a day for the last six years and complained of tiredness , appetite loss and persistent vomiting .
A heart trace revealed she had an irregular heartbeat , probably caused by her low blood potassium levels .
Once she stopped drinking so much cola , she made a full and uneventful recovery .
The investigators believe these cases are not atypical and that many people risk problems due to their intake .
Moderate consumption of cola drinks is completely safe and people can continue to enjoy such drinks as part of a balanced diet and active lifestyle
A spokeswoman from the British Soft Drinks Association Manufacturers insist the products are safe when consumed in moderation .
In a commentary , Dr Clifford Packer from the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Centre in Ohio said : " We have every reason to think that it is not rare .
" With aggressive mass marketing , super - sizing of soft drinks , and the effects of caffeine tolerance and dependence , there is very little doubt that tens of millions of people in industrialised countries drink at least 2 - 3 l of cola per day .
" It follows that the serum potassium levels of these heavy cola drinkers are dropping , in some cases , to dangerous low levels . "
Moderation
The author of the research paper , Dr Moses Elisaf from the University of Ioannina in Greece , said it appeared that hypokalaemia can be caused by excessive consumption of three of the most common ingredients in cola drinks - glucose , fructose and caffeine .
" The individual role of each of these ingredients in the pathophysiology of cola - induced hypokalaemia has not been determined and may vary in different patients .
" However in most of the cases we looked at for our review , caffeine intoxication was thought to play the most important role .
" This has been borne out by case studies that focus on other products that contain high levels of caffeine but no glucose or fructose . "
Despite this , he warned that caffeine free cola products could also cause hypokalaemia because the fructose they contain can cause diarrhoea .
" We believe that further studies are needed to establish how much is too much when it comes to the daily consumption of cola drinks . "
Excessive consumption has already been linked with obesity , diabetes and tooth and bone problems .
A spokeswoman from the British Soft Drinks Association said : " The examples used in this paper by the IJCP are all very extreme cases - moderate consumption of cola drinks is completely safe and people can continue to enjoy such drinks as part of a balanced diet and active lifestyle .
" The soft drinks industry is committed to encouraging responsible consumption of all its products .
Nutrition labelling is included on pack so people can make an informed choice about the products they are drinking . "

Scientists in Shanghai have challenged the orthodox medical view that a woman is born with egg cells to last a lifetime and will never generate any new ones .
Overthrow of this view could hold major implications for treatment of infertility .
Similar challenges have been made before , but have not been sustained .
Earlier this month , however , the same medical doctrine with respect to heart muscle cells  that you die with the same cells you are born with  was shown by a Swedish scientist , Jonas Frisen , to be incorrect : the muscle cells do get replaced , though very slowly , at the rate of 1 percent or less per year .
The Chinese team , led by Kang Zou and Ji Wu of Shanghai Jiao Tong University , worked only with mice , but because of the similarity of all mammalian physiology , any proof that mice could produce eggs after birth would set off a race to prove that people could too .
In essence , the Shanghai researchers say they have detected , in both young and old mice , the germ - line cells that produce unfertilized eggs , or oocytes .
US and foreign banks were not unwitting victims of circumstance but deliberately culpable in the financial meltdown that engulfed the United States last year , a campaign group said Wednesday .
The Center for Public Integrity named 25 " subprime " mortgage companies whose risky lending was blamed for the US property market collapse and the subsequent global economic crisis .
Many of the lenders were either controlled by US and European banks , or could not have indulged in their high - risk lending spree without the connivance of banks , the investigative journalism group said in a new study .
" The mega - banks that funded the subprime industry were not victims of an unforeseen financial collapse , as they have sometimes portrayed themselves , " the center 's executive director Bill Buzenberg said .
" These banks were deliberate enablers that bankrolled the type of lending that 's now threatening the financial system , " he said .
This country appears to be on the right track , at last .
Was it release of the torture memos ?
The stock market ?
Michelle 's arms ?
Teabagging ?
Regardless , the new AP and Pew polls have some striking changes in the political landscape , and some reaffirmation of Obama 's leadership .
First , from AP ( MoE +/- 3.1 ) there 's the startling result of right track being higher than wrong track
for the first time in years ( January , 2004 , actually .
And right track was 17 in October , prior to the election . )
Generally speaking , would you say things in this country are heading in the right direction or in the wrong direction ?
Right Wrong 4/20 : 48 44
2/17 : 40 49
1/14 : 35 54
12/08 : 32 60
Obama also gets a 76 for being a strong leader and Republicans are seen ( by 65 % ) as not cooperating enough with him .
His overall approval is 64 ( 67 in the last poll in February , 2009 . )
And Americans cut Obama slack in terms of when to expect economic improvement ( 72 % say it will take longer than the first year . )
On the important question of how to spend the public 's money :
As you may know , it is estimated that the federal budget deficit now exceeds one trillion dollars .
If you had to choose , what do you think should be the HIGHER priority ?
[ READ EACH ITEM . ]
[ RANDOMIZE ORDER ]
Increasing government spending on education , health care
reform , and the development of alternative energy sources ,
even if that means the federal budget deficit will increase
even more 49 Reducing the federal budget deficit by cutting spending , even
if that means the government could not enact new programs
on education , health care reform , and the development of
alternative energy sources 43
That 's actually pretty impressive as no one likes to spend money .
Other highlights include a 50 - 29 lead for support of Dems over the GOP in Congress on handling the economy , support for troops to afghanistan ( 53 ) and withdrawl from iraq by 2010 ( 74 ) .
The respected Pew poll ( MoE +/- 3.0 ) notes Obama exceeding recent history :
As he approaches the 100 - day mark of his presidency , Barack Obama ’s job approval ratings are higher than those of his most recent predecessors .
However , the 44th president is even more distinguished by his strong personal popularity .
Fully 73 % of Americans – including as many as 46 % of Republicans – hold a favorable view of Obama as a person .
Fewer people held favorable impressions of George W. Bush ( 61 % ) and Bill Clinton ( 60 % ) early in their first years .
Obama ’s job approval stands at 63 % , while 26 % disapprove of the way he is handling his job as president .
His approval rating is up slightly from March ( 59 % ) .
Opinions about Obama ’s performance remain highly partisan .
Fully 93 % of Democrats approve of the way Obama is handling his job as president , compared with just 30 % of Republicans .
Independents ’ opinions fall in between , with 58 % expressing positive views of his performance and 27 % negative opinions .
In terms of the ever - popular " partisan " question , along with " what do independents think ? " the answer is Obama 's doing very well :
Obama ’s approval rating among independents is on par with those of Bush and Clinton .
However , more independents approve of Obama ’s performance very strongly ( 37 % ) than did so for either Bush ( 29 % ) or Clinton ( 10 % ) .
About a quarter of independents ( 27 % ) disapprove of the way Obama is handling his job , which is about the same as Bush ’s disapproval mark ( 26 % ) and lower than Clinton ’s ( 35 % ) .
These are very strong numbers for Obama and his policies .
Even Bayh , John Boehner and the media : take good notes .
If you are going to try and stand in the way , you 'd better have some aspirin and bandages handy .
You 're going to need them .
Oh , and note what this means for the future , Republicans .
Younger voters are not impressed with the party of " no " .
But people 50 and older are more skeptical of the way Obama is handling his job and dealing with individual issues .
The largest differences are in opinions about Obama ’s handling of health care : 63 % of those younger than 30 give him positive marks , compared with 55 % of those 30 to 49 , 42 % of those ages 50 to 64 , and 40 % of those 65 and older .
Older Americans are divided in their opinions of Obama ’s handling of the budget deficit , while majorities of those younger than 50 approve of his handling of the issue .
That also is the case with opinions about Obama ’s job performance on tax policy .
Obama is still seen as a change agent , and most see Obama fulfilling expectations .
People really like Michelle , too .
Democrats and lower income folks have an improved view of Obama 's policies , and that 's true ( less so ) for Rs and Is .
For out - of - power Republicans looking to the future , things could n't get much worse .
Could they ?

Scientists argue that itching is most likely related to grooming , and evolved to protect animals against some toxic plants , as well as insects , along with the diseases they can transmit , like malaria , yellow fever and river blindness .
But the biology of itch has been a mystery , and neglected for years by researchers , who have been far more focused on pain .
Some 50 diseases leave people in a misery of itching which usually cannot be treated .
Studies among kidney disease patients and psychiatric inpatients have found that itch is among the top complaints .
And when it is severe it keeps people up at night , often worsening their condition .
The new study suggests that itch , like pain , may be a “ gated ” system in which signals from other nerve cells can interfere with or moderate the sensation .
Scratching the skin near , but not directly on , the spot that itches often provides relief , just as rubbing an aching limb can reduce pain .
Perceptions in the brain , too , probably moderate the urge to scratch : some chronic , compulsive cases of itching suggest that the brain is not properly reading the effect of outside signals at all but is instead acting on a mistaken internal representation of what is happening to the skin .
As with some kinds of pain , subtle reminders of an itching sensation can get people scratching , often without being entirely aware of it .
“ I give lectures about itching , ” Dr. Giesler said , “ and I ’ll stand up there in front of a whole roomful of people , show a few slides and pretty soon I ’ll look out and 90 percent of the audience is scratching . ”
Like yawning , itching also seems to be contagious , which suggests a significant top - down influence from the brain .
Dr. Yosipovitch said there was a long way to go before doctors could expect treatments .
For one thing , the miserable , chronic itch common in many medical problems most likely involves other mechanisms in addition to those identified in the study .
And the brain may be critically involved in escalating itch , in ways that are not yet understood .
“ But as a clinician , I feel excited about the finding , ” he said .
“ It ’s a sign that this field is really evolving . ”
Max Baucus Should Not Be Deciding Health Care for America VIEWPOINT : Max Baucus Should Not Be Deciding Health Care for America
The “ Senator for K Street ” is Putting Campaign Donor Profits Ahead of the Basic Needs of the People by Kevin Zeese 31 May 2009
Why are n’t single payer advocates allowed to testify before Baucus ’ committee ?
Follow the money .
Senator Max Baucus and the Senate Finance Committee are too corrupted by corporate health industry profiteers donations to give America the health care policy it needs .
Health care is 15 % of the U.S. gross domestic product .
U.S. health care expenditures , which have been rising rapidly for several years , surpassed $ 2.4 trillion in 2007 , more than three times the $ 714 billion spent in 1990 .
The cost of health care is projected to reach $ 4.4 trillion by 2018 .
There is a lot of room for corporate profiteering in the increasing cost of health care .
The millions the health care industry has invested in Baucus and the Senate Finance Committee could therefore turn out to be very profitable .
It is evident that any bill that comes out of the Senate Finance Committee will be a pro-industry bill that will ensure trillions in profits for the health insurance industry , HMOs and the pharmaceutical industry .
Baucus has held two hearings so far and has refused to allow advocates for the most popular reform — a single payer national health policy — to even testify .
Single payer " improved Medicare for all " is favored by more than 60 % of Americans as well as majorities of doctors , nurses and economists .
It is the most cost - effective and efficient way to provide health care to all Americans from cradle to grave .
Why are n’t single payer advocates allowed to testify before Baucus ’ committee ?
Follow the money .
Campaign donations explain why , and demonstrate that the Senate Finance Committee should not be in charge of health care .
Senator Reid should remove the health care reform bill from Baucus and start all over before the Health Committee in the Senate .
Here ’s why Baucus is not doing the people 's business : According to OpenSecrets.org , over his career he has taken donations from :
The Insurance Industry : $ 1,170,313
Health Professionals : $ 1,016,276
Pharmaceuticals / Health Products Industry : $ 734,605
Hospitals / Nursing Homes : $ 541,891
Health Services / HMOs : $ 439,700 Baucus has shown his bias and should be removed from leading the health care reform effort by the Democratic Party leadership .
That is a grand total of $ 3,902,785 .
Can we trust Baucus to put aside the profits of the industries that have kept him in the Senate ?
Will he put the people ’s necessities ahead of the profits of his contributors ?
Baucus has shown his bias and should be removed from leading the health care reform effort by the Democratic Party leadership .
In 2008 Baucus had virtually no challenger in Montana .
A little - known Republican was on the ballot , and Baucus won with 73 % of the vote .
But , Baucus sought big donations from big business anyway .
He used his connections to corporations with business before his committee to raise an immense campaign fund of more than $ 11 million .
In 2008 , 91 % of his donations come from individuals living outside of Montana , which is why he is more the “ Senator for K Street ” then the Senator for Montana .
Corporate health profiteers who invested in Baucus will now benefit from his stewardship over health care reform .
His 2008 donations from health care profiteers included : Insurance : $ 592,185
Health Professionals : $ 537,141
Pharmaceuticals / Health Products : $ 524,813
Health Services / HMOs : $ 364,500
Hospitals / Nursing Homes : $ 332,826
That is $ 1,826,652
Baucus took from these industries , and now he can reward them by deforming health care reform .
The health care profiteers knew that Baucus would determine their fate and ponied up .
Now the only thing standing between them and their payback is a single payer national health care plan .
Yet single payer , which would end private insurance and control the cost of pharmaceutical drugs , is not being considered — not even allowed to participate in the conversation before Baucus .
It is not just the chairman of the committee who has received massive donations .
The full Finance Committee is a gluttonous embarrassment of campaign pay - offs .
In 2008 the committee members received a total of $ 13,263,986 from industries affected by health care reform .
Can we trust this committee to put the interests of the people before their donors ?
The donations to the Finance Committee in 2008 included : Insurance : $ 5,103,900
Pharmaceuticals / Health Products : $ 3,308,831
Hospitals / Nursing Homes : $ 2,809,353
Health Services / HMOs : $ 2,041,902
These industries expect to be rewarded with billions , even trillions , in profits and hundreds of millions in corporate welfare .
Senator Baucus ’s behavior shows they have made a good investment — they 've bought themselves a senator who should be called Chairman Blagojevich .
He is doing his best to make sure the single payer message is not heard because he knows it is the fairest , most efficient and cost - effective way to ensure health care access for all Americans — but he can't let that be implemented because it would put some of his donors out of business and control the profits of others .
It is time to remove Baucus from the leadership of health care reform .
It is time to move the critically important priority of reforming America ’s health care system from the Finance Committee and put it before the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee .
At least their mission is health care , not money .
Kevin Zeese is the executive director of the FreshAirCleanPolitics.net , which is urging a single payer national health care system as part of its Prosperity Agenda .
US project .
Along with seven others , Zeese was arrested when he testified from the audience of a recent Senate Finance Committee meeting on health care .

The re-scheduled first MotoGP race of 2009 saw Casey Stoner take victory at the Commercialbank Grand Prix of Qatar .
As the action in the premier class of the 2009 FIM MotoGP World Championship finally got underway , at the spectacular Losail International Circuit on Monday night , it was Casey Stoner who took the headlines , completing a hat - trick of season - opening wins in Qatar .
Following the exceptional postponement of the opening MotoGP contest of the year due to rain in the Arabian desert , Monday evening witnessed the first race in the new single tyre supplier era , but it was a familiar story with Stoner crossing the line first , ahead of World Champion Valentino Rossi .
A ruthless Stoner took the holeshot from pole and had built up a two second gap at the end of the first lap .
The 2007 World Champion ’s victory never looked in serious doubt as he controlled the race from the front , having been the fastest rider in every session over the weekend .
Stoner ’s winning margin was more than seven seconds at the end of a brilliant performance , casting aside any doubts about his fitness after winter surgery on his left wrist .
Completing the podium behind the front two was Rossi ’s Fiat Yamaha colleague Jorge Lorenzo repeating his rostrum result from his MotoGP debut in the opening race of 2008 , in his first race on Bridgestone tyres .
Monster Yamaha Tech 3 ’s Colin Edwards started his seventh season in MotoGP riding solidly from sixth on the grid to finish fourth on his own Bridgestone debut , making it three Yamahas in the top four .
Also on new tyres and with a new factory bike Repsol Honda ’s 2009 signing Andrea Dovizioso was fifth , fading slightly in the second half of the race having run in third place for several laps .
There was a good performance from Alex de Angelis , crossing the line sixth having qualified ninth at the start of his second year with the San Carlo Honda Gresini team .
Rizla Suzuki’s Chris Vermeulen also made a decent start to the year with his improved GSV -R machine in seventh .
An excellent MotoGP debut from satellite Ducati rider Mika Kallio , meanwhile , saw him end up as the best placed rookie in eighth for the new look Pramac Racing outfit .
On factory machinery and returning to the Honda Gresini team this year , Toni Elías may be disappointed not to have done better than ninth , whilst Frenchman Randy de Puniet brought the satellite LCR Honda RC212V home three seconds behind the Spaniard to complete the top ten .
Dani Pedrosa , riding with knee and wrist injuries , battled through the pain barrier to pick up some important points in eleventh spot .
On his Ducati debut , Pedrosa ’s former team - mate Nicky Hayden also did well to complete the race in twelfth , given the back and chest injuries he suffered in a huge highside crash in qualifying on Saturday .
The brave 2006 World Champion even set his best time on the last lap .
Sete Gibernau finished 13th on his MotoGP comeback with the satellite Ducati Grupo Francisco Hernando team , unable to push into the top ten due to his ongoing shoulder injury .
Marco Melandri made his first appearance for the Hayate Racing Team and ran off track early on but battled back well to finish in the points in 14th .
Commencing his 20th Grand Prix season Rizla Suzuki ’s Loris Capirossi crashed out on lap eight and was unable to rejoin the race .
After a weekend off the MotoGP riders next reconvene at the Polini Grand Prix of Japan for round two , which takes place at the Motegi circuit from 24th - 26th April .
Two shots of measles vaccine given during childhood protect a person for life .
Four shots of polio vaccine do the same .
But flu shots must be taken every year .
And even so , they provide less than complete protection .
The reason is that the influenza virus mutates much more rapidly than most other viruses .
A person who develops immunity to one strain of the virus is not well protected from a different strain .
That is shaping up to be a major problem as the world prepares for a possible pandemic this fall from the new strain of swine flu .
It is impossible to know how many people might die before a vaccine matched to that strain can be manufactured .
But scientists and vaccine manufacturers are hard at work on a so - called universal flu vaccine that would work against all types of flu .
The goal is to provide protection for years , if not a whole lifetime , against all seasonal flu strains and pandemic strains , making flu inoculation much more like that for measles and polio .
25 Debt Reduction Tips For Your Immediate Action Plan
With credit cards so convenient , loans so common and debt socially acceptable , getting into debt is extremely easy .
I still have vivid memories of the two people who sold me on my college credit card .
It had the school logo on there and best of all , it helped the school every time I use the card to pay for a purchase .
How cool is that ?
Get Out of Debt Now with These Tips
Avoiding debt is an advice most do n’t appreciate until they are swamped with bills and obligations .
For years , many just pay the minimum payment on their credit cards and think of their house as an ATM machine .
Now that the economy is deteriorating and people are worried about their jobs , everyone is finally thinking about debt load .
If you are concerned about all the loans that you need to pay off , use the time you are worrying and spend some time implementing the following 25 tips to reduce your debt instead .
Focus on the Prize – Motivation is key to succeeding with paying off your debt .
Get a Post - It , write down your total debt and tape it on your computer monitor .
Seeing the number go down is a huge motivator .
Some people like to instead motivate themselves by looking at the reward ( perhaps a picture of your happy family to remind you how relaxing being debt free can be ) .
That works just as well .
Debt Snowball – Some like to pay the highest interest rate first and others like to pay the smallest loans first .
Whichever method you choose , debt snowball works because you are concentrating on one loan and the psychological benefit of paying them off helps tremendously .
Get a Side Job –
You are afraid of your job but how many of you are actually trying to get another job in this economy ?
Whether it ’s building up some form of passive income or getting a part time job , side hustling is still the quickest way to make more money .
Freeze Your Credit Cards – I personally think credit cards are great because of the rewards you earn but the plastic cards are clearly not for everyone .
If you have a hard time keeping yourself from splurging , just freeze them .
Have Constant Reminders – Reducing debt is a long journey that takes discipline .
Whether it ’s setting reminders on your calendar or setting an alarm on your phone to alert you to pay bills , anything you can do to trigger your mind about your path to financial freedom is encouraged ( and sometimes necessary ) .
Have a Regular Meeting About Debt – Schedule a monthly meeting with your family and figure out how to save more money and pay off your debt more rapidly .
In the meeting , talk about your progress , dream up ideas and make some point form actions for the next 30 days .
Take Ownership –
The most important step in becoming debt free is taking responsibility .
The credit card companies may have encouraged you through the years to limit your spending but it ’s ultimately you who racked up those charges .
Stop complaining and start doing something about it .
Understand That This is a Problem – No company is ever going to keep lending you money forever and ever .
Stop wishing that the problem will just go away by itself and start dealing with the situation .
Debt is a problem .
Start reducing what you owe immediately and stop thinking that you should drag it out infinitely .
Learn the Power of Compounding Interest – I imagine that people who are in debt do n’t really understand the essence of compound interest .
Remember all those charts that show how interests compound when you invest ?
When you are in debt , this is just in reverse .
Read the Fine Print –
The majority of us do n’t really pay attention to the fine print when we take a loan or apply for a credit card because those details are confusing and boring to read .
Considering how much the detail can affect us ( for examples , just look at all those people with rate adjustable mortgage rates ) , it might even make sense in some cases to hire someone to read and explain everything to you .
Take some time to understand those documents and save yourself from a possible disaster .
Mind the Small Fees – There ’s no question that small fees add up .
Couple bucks here , several meals there and you are looking at thousands and thousands of dollars each year .
Every penny counts .
Save them up and use it to repay your loans .
Paying Minimum Payment Sucks – Everyone just paying the minimum amount due would be a dream come true for credit card companies .
Do you really want them to make money off of you ?
Do n’t Always Upgrade Your Lifestyle with Income Increases –
It ’s so easy to instantly upgrade your lifestyle whenever your income increases .
Getting a raise or a promotion is such a happy event so even though celebrating is good and well deserved , imagine what you can do to your debt repayment schedule if you put those extra dollars at work .
Start a Budget – People do n’t budget because the task is boring but it absolutely works .
Knowing where your money is going is the first step to figuring out how to save more money .
More money saved , more money to repay loans .
Do n’t Keep
Up with the Jones –
When all your neighbors and friends are buying new cars and going out to fancy restaurants , it ’s hard to just say no .
However , which would you choose ?
A miserable retirement or a comfortable one ?
Fancy Does n’t Mean Better –
We ’ve been taught to equate price to quality .
If something is more expensive , it automatically means that it ’s better right ?
You know what ’s really better for you ?
Be debt free , that ’s what .
Send Micro Payments Instead of a Big One – Some loans compound daily ( read the fine print to find out which ones , or you can always call and ask ) so the sooner you can send in payment , the better .
Instead of sending money once a month , try sending in smaller amounts whenever you have money to save on interest .
Also , look for ways to cut down the delivery time .
For example , online bill pay or online payment might be faster than mailing out a check , which cuts down the interest further .
Consolidate Your Debt if Possible – Unless you can keep up with all the bills , sometimes it ’s just easier to consolidate your debt .
It might make sense to take a home equity loan for example to pay off all the different credit cards and auto loans if the interest works in your favor , not to mention that it ’s much easier to manage one loan instead of six .
Sell All the Stuff You Do n’t Need – On ebay , craigslist , or anywhere you can .
In addition , record the purchase price , selling price and the difference .
Add up all the difference and you will know how much you have spent for temporary owning all these products .
Now , tell your family that number .
Credit Cards are Loans –
The purchasing power of your credit card is not the same as cash ( Even 0 % balance transfer credit cards may come with a cost ) .
Drill it in your head that using your card is borrowing money that needs to be repaid .
Ask for a Lower Rate – Do n’t be afraid to call your loan company up and try to negotiated .
There is no shame and there is nothing to lose .
Tell them why they should lower your rate and you might just succeed .
Success Breeds Success – Start hanging around people with the right mindset .
Tell your friends who do n’t share the same values to stay away .
The right support system will help you accomplish your goals much faster .
Keep Trying to Trim Your Bills –
Be persistent because there are always more ways to save money .
Always .
Make a Plan –
The great thing about having a plan is that you get to see progress .
I love it when I make a To - Do list and start crossing things out and I ’m sure you will enjoy doing it as well .
Find a Debt Reduction Buddy –
The idea is the same as having frugal friends .
Accountability and encouragement will go a long way in helping you on your path to become debt free .
Find a buddy and help each other reduce your respective debts .
Have another monthly meeting with him / her , share this article , talk about ways to save and inspire each other to be financially free .
Get started today .

Most people can appreciate the sweet taste of a chocolate bar which is why the news of the health benefits of Dark Chocolate and cocoa powder was met with such enthusiasm .
That something could taste so good and still be healthy struck a responsive note with many people .
While the health benefits of cocoa have been demonstrated , the decision to add significant amounts of chocolate and cocoa to your diet may not be as clear cut .
Cocoa health benefits
Chocolate and cocoa derive their health benefits from flavonoids which are plant pigments capable of acting as antioxidants to counteract some of the cellular damage that can lead to chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease .
Cocoa powder has also been shown to lower blood pressure and improve blood flow in humans .
A cup of cocoa has almost three times the antioxidants of a cup of green tea , another drink renowned for its health benefits .
With all of the antioxidant capabilities of cocoa it may seem like a no - brainer to add dark chocolate and cocoa to your diet .
While cocoa is still recommended by most experts when consumed in reasonable quantities , the health benefits of cocoa should be balanced by its potential drawbacks .
Cocoa and your mood
Have you ever wondered why chocolate has an uplifting effect on mood ?
This is very likely due to its content of phenylethylamine which has a mood elevating effect somewhat akin to amphetamine type substances .
While this may be a positive for those who are depressed , it can be a negative for people prone to anxiety or panic attacks .
Plus , there ’s evidence that this chemical can be addictive .
Could this be where the term chocoholic comes from ?
When consuming chocolate rather than cocoa powder , other ingredients added to the chocolate must be considered .
Unless you ’re consuming a sugar - free , dark chocolate bar , most commercial chocolate bars contain sugar which can have an adverse effect on insulin levels .
To get the full benefits of chocolate , the chocolate chosen should be dark chocolate , not milk chocolate since there ’s some evidence that milk negates some of the apparent health benefits of cocoa .
The other alternative is to get the benefits from drinking cocoa powder , but this , too , has its problems .
Many cocoa powders are processed and contain such undesirable additives as hydrogenated oils , high fructose corn syrup , and milk products .
In addition , cocoa powder has been found to contain high levels of acrylamides , substances known to increase the cancer rate in animals and is considered to be a probable human carcinogen .
Although chocolate and cocoa powder do n’t have extremely high levels of caffeine , they do have significant quantities of xanthines which are toxic to dogs and cats which is why you ’re instructed not to give pets chocolate .
Other drawbacks to excessive chocolate consumption include the rather high calorie load associated with most chocolate formulations .
If you want the health benefits of cocoa with fewer of the potential drawbacks , it ’s best to consume as pure of a formulation of cocoa as possible with the lowest calorie content .
Plus , it ’s probably best to alternate chocolate and cocoa intake with green tea , red wine , and other health sources of antioxidants to maximize benefits with fewer negative effects .
The conclusion ?
Dark chocolate and unprocessed cocoa powder can be a positive addition to a healthy diet if chosen and used wisely .

oh wait , they ’re still serious ?
The Texan Institute For Creation Research is still dead set on issuing an M.S. in creationism , and they have 80 pages of ( nonsensical ) reasons why .
In the end of March , I wrote about the Institute for Creation Research applying for the authority to issue science degrees and being denied right after the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board could catch its breath after laughing .
After the huge debate died down and the story dropped from the radars of social bookmarking sites , I thought that would be the last we hear of the ICR ’s bizarre quest .
I was wrong .
The ICR is back and they ’re suing the Coordinating Board into handing them the right to give science degrees in creationism .
On what grounds ?
Apparently , the Board violated their freedom of speech , freedom of press and freedom of religious exercise .
Right .
Which is exactly why they ’re free to complain about the decision , continue to run their institute in peace , publish whatever they want on the subject and keep believing in Christian fundamentalism .
Essentially , the ICR is complaining that those in charge of making sure that education is based on sound facts rather than personal opinions of preachers disagree with their ideas and that disagreement is somehow tantamount to persecution .
It ’s like a spoiled child throwing a temper tantrum when he does n’t get a shiny new toy that catches his eye .
The complaint itself is some 80 pages and contains even more of the same facepalm - inducing arguments I ’ve taken to task before .
According to the sharp legal minds at the ICR , since the Board ’s Commissioner was n’t alive during the Big Bang , he had no authority to have it taught as fact .
Really ?
In that case , those who were n’t alive during the American Revolutionary War ca n’t possibly have the authority to teach it .
Do you know any living person who was stationed in Valley Forge with George Washington ?
No ?
No one at all ?
Well , let ’s strike that from the curriculum .
Without eye - witness knowledge , it ’s all just the opinion of school board members and mainstream historians .
But what ’s that you say ?
We have documents and evidence for the Revolutionary War ?
Well , funny you should mention that because thanks to the laws of physics , we can look back in time and get a good idea of how the visible , known universe started out .
The ICR might want to read up on some actual science before they go around issuing science degrees .
The fact that the speed of photons in a light beam is finite and when we look at the sky , we ’re looking back in time is part of a basic middle school science class .
It ’s hard for me to imagine a college graduate with a B.S. or M.S. degree who is n’t aware of this fact .
Just because you think something is true does n’t make it so and no matter how devoted you are to your idea , it does n’t give you the right to arbitrarily issue science degrees .
The THECB ’s Commissioner is n’t randomly coming up with whatever he wants to be taught in colleges .
Dr. Raymund Paredes relies on hundreds of thousands of peer reviewed papers and meticulously researched books by experts based on evidence ranging from genetics to the fossil record , to zoology and laboratory experiments .
The ICR , on the other hand , uses nothing but blind faith and fiery but empty rhetoric devoid of any scientific fact .
Of course , if they want to drag out a second rejection and waste hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees , nobody will stop them .

So , if most of us are not endowed with talents or intellectualism to change the world , what the heck are we doing here ?
my
good
I 've been a tad quiet lately ( for me ) because I 've been sort of going through an existential crisis .
When I was in college , I came home for my first Spring Break and , because I could n't get enough of my group of college friends , I met a bunch of them for dinner .
My particular group of friends during this time was a group of Deep Thinkers .
We would meet at a little bar / cafe near campus and talk for hours , HOURS , about the meaning of life and why there was air and other Deep Things .
So , on this spring break , I went to do the same thing because we had n't quite figured the Air Thing out yet .
I would like to make very plain that I was underage and not drinking on this particular night .
Because I had the weirdest experience -- I 've never forgotten it -- and I do n't want y'all thinking that it was alcohol - induced .
Or that there was any other funny stuff involved , if you know what I mean .
While seated at this table of people , I had the distinct feeling of both being AT the table and ABOVE the table .
( Remember - - no mood altering substances involved ! ) ( Also ?
Not a near - death experience .
There was no tunnel , no light , no one beckoning me forward . )
( I know , I know - - it 's very odd .
There I was : stone sober and floating above a table in a nice restaurant in Dallas . )
And as I was fully participating in the conversation , I was also sort of floating above it , thinking , " But nothing anyone here is saying is truly original thought !
This is all intellectual regurgitation !
We are all FRAUDS .
" I excused myself and drove home to my parent 's house and sat down on my bed ( which was actually not MY bed but the guest room bed since as soon as I left for college my parents turned my bedroom into their study and soldbed . )
( Not that I 'm bitter . )
( Can you say , " youngest of four children off to college , hallelujah ? " ) and stared at the wall .
There is nothing as lonely as an eighteen year old college freshman whose world has just been shaken to its core and who is out of chocolate and sitting in the guest room of her parents ' house .
I started to think , ' well , maybe true original thought does n't really exist except in a mind like an Einstein or a Mozart or other people who have the capacity to change the world .
' Which , um , begs the question , " My mother came intothe guest room at this point and sensing that something was up , asked me what was going on .
I told her about my revelations of the evening and she said , " Well , I believe that our purpose here is to do the best we can , to be kind and honorable and to leave the world a little better than we found it .
We do n't all have the capacity to change the world so we work with what we have .
" My mother is not the most comforting person in the world .
But she is pragmatic and very honest .
So , then I went back to college and told my boyfriend , who was not really part of my social circle of clove cigarette - smoking pseudo - intellectuals , about the whole experience and he looked at me and said , " Well , * I * know why we 're here .
" I said , " Really ?
Why ?
" And he said , " God . "
And then there was a lot of kissing and for a long time I studied religions and theology and did a lot more kissing until it all got sort of confused in my brain -- the boy and kissing and God .
When the boy and I broke up , many years later , I sort of lost my religion and my church home , too , but never my belief in God .
Then I met my husband ( really , reallykissing ) and we got married and had children and my life was all about keeping them from dying by feeding them and washing them and entertaining them and fighting with them about screen time .
Fast - forward eleven years and here I am with my children vastly more independent ( although they still need me to reach the ice cream sandwiches ) and my husband working a lot of hours and I sit , having the same attack of questions I had 26 years ago as a naive college kid .
If I 'm not here to do great things and change the world and be on Oprah , why AM I here ?
What am I doing with my life ?
So , I 've been struggling with these large deep questions and I 've talked to a few of my cyber friends about this and in the end , I keep coming back to God and small things .
Because the God I know does n't charge me to go out and do Big Things and change the course of the world -- especially if those Big Important Things are about glorifying MYSELF .
He / She / FSM charges me to be a good person ( no lying , cheating , murdering , adultering ... ) and to go about my day loving people and doing the small things before me with as much love and grace and gratitude as I can muster .
There 's this great John Hiatt song called " Through Your Hands " that says , " Whatever your hands find to do , you must do with all your heart . "
Sometimes I forget , though , and I become discontented with the small things : the thousands of meals I make that do n't get eaten , the tons of laundry I turn right - side - out and fold neatly that ends up back in the hamper , the six trips a week I make to the grocery store because I can't ever get organized enough to buy everything at once ... the sheer mind - numbing repetitive futility of it all robs me of my joy .
I wish there was a reset button that would bring me back to the place where I could appreciate the rhythm of these small days .
Of course , as soon as I wrote that , Spring arrived all in a rush and it turns out there IS a reset button .
Ana ( 11 ) and I started some seeds on Earth Day and here it is , three days later and we have sprouts -- miraculous and tiny .
It 's the ultimate microcosm of how small things have the potential to bring great joy ( not to mention a summer 's worth of tomato sandwiches . ) I guess there are all kinds of ways to change the world .
Some people need an excuse to party and I think I 've come up with one for July .
After all , there are no major holidays after July 4th until Sept. 7 , 2009 , Labor Day .
However , on July 22 , 2009 , there 's going to be an unusually Â lengthy total eclipse of the sun ( visible in some part of the world - most notably , India and China ) .
If you are well - heeled ( got bucks ) you still have time to book yourself on one of the many Solar Eclipse tours that will take you to the best viewing spots in India ( Darjeeling ) and Bhutan or over to China , reportedly the best viewing locations for this spectacular phenomenon .
Researching the net , I found many opportunities to book a Solar Eclipse tourÂ - or even another one , later on to view another eclipse in a different part of the world ( Moon and Sun eclipses seem to occur once or twice per year ) .
The tour that most appealed to me was managed by Astronomy professors , but there are many tour varieties - including some that will also stop at various wondrous tourist attractions in exotic locations .
Some of these tours book years in advance , but given the economy , you might luck out and land a spot or two .
To be precise about the July 22 eclipse : This July 22 eclipse will be the longest total solar eclipse in the 21st Century ; another one like this will not occur until 2132 ( long past my bed time ) .
This unusually long eclipse is expected to last up to 6 minutes , 39 seconds .
It will be visible from a narrow corridor through northern India , northern Bangladesh , Bhutan , the northern tip of Myanmar , central China and the Pacific Ocean , including the Ryukyu Islands ( Okinawa ) .
You can view the total eclipse in such cities as Surat , Hangzhou and Shanghai .
Â
A partial eclipse will be visible from most of South East Asia and northeastern Oceania .
If you happen to live near these locations , hooray for you - you will experience a once in a lifetime Eclipse !
Â
However , if you do n't , I am sure you can catch the views on CNN or YouTube or other up - to - the - moment news channels some time on the 21st or before .
The news media ( such as it is , these days ) is likely to start buzzing about the Eclipse a week or so before it occurs .
Consider this an early heads - up ( but remember as you get close to the actual Eclipse , not to look at the sun directly and to wear your sunglasses if the Eclipse is not a total black - out in your area ) .
Also , in some locations , you wo n't see it at all ( Do n't let the sun catch you crying ) .
I say : time to plan an Eclipse Party .
July 22 falls on a Wednesday ; July 21st is Tuesday depending on where you live .
Not exactly an optimal party night , but hey , we 're talking really , really long total eclipse .
Celebrate !
Invite your friends over for a drink ( how about a Tequila Sunrise ? ) and some snacks ( do n't forget the sunflower seeds ) and whatever other appetizers you may want to serve .
Finish off with a sweet treat : an ice cream sundae .
( I suggest a mix of vanilla and chocolate , with a few Oreo cookies on top ) .
At my party , Â I 'm going to serve pizza : cheese and black olive , to be exact .
I will probably get carried away with the black olives .
I 'm going to implement a dress code : everyone must wear black ( head to toe , hats optional , as are sunglasses .
The more someone looks like a Blues Brother or a Man in Black , the better ) .
A little thematic music will be called for : eclipse music , like The Doors , Jimi Hendrix and Miles Davis .
But the music selection is entirely up to you ; it 's your eclipse too .
( If you 're stymied , you might want to think about Elton John and his going - down Sun or Andy Williams and his moon river ) .
Â
Whatever music you choose , get creative and have fun with it .
You will most likely need to make your own invitations ( I do n't believe Hallmark has caught on ) .
I suggest a Dragon motif as an invite cover .
In ancient times , people thought an eclipse was caused by a Dragon eating the sun or the moon .
I am sure you can either draw or find a dragon to download on the internet to create a cool invite .
Today , most people do not get as freaked out about eclipses as they did long ago .
Although in some parts of the world , people will take their spoons and other implements and bang on pots and pans to drive the Eclipse away ( that usually works ) .
Also , in some parts of the world , people will stay inside during an Eclipse , because in some places , myths endure .
In some locations , eclipses are seen as mighty omens .
Eclipses have their places in Astrology charts - mainly by those who read houses and the degrees where planets fall in different houses .
I am not one of those astrologers - I stick to three main psychic astrology archetypes ( sun , moon , rising sign ) , but I know an Eclipse has some powerful mojo , no matter what your sign or where your houses are located .
Vintage astrologer Katherine de Jersey used to get excited when she found eclipses in her clients ' charts .
She said earth - shaking events occurred shortly after even a partial eclipse .
I do n't know about that , although I imagine if you manage to get born during this total eclipse , it will say something about your personal power and your changing moods ( you will be a first Decan Leo - which will make you not only strong , but slightly mischievous and capable of dramatic mood changes ) .
Although different astrologers have different methods of calculating the impact of an eclipse on any given chart , they seem to be unanimous in their opinion that eclipses represent change .
Bring it on !
I 've been writing about change in Astrology and in the cosmos for many a moon ( or should I say sun ) , so a really long eclipse seems to fit our current dramatic change cycle and impact all of our Signs .
Perhaps on July 23 , we will all feel better - more in tune with the times - and more adaptable to the ups and downs of the remaining months in 2009 .
Party hearty .

THE Rudd Government has made two important symbolic statements on indigenous rights .
The first was the apology to the stolen generations .
The second came on Friday when it gave formal support to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples .
While both are important steps forward , neither can hide the fact that Australia 's legal system still reflects the racism of our past .
Critics of the declaration have raised fears that it will undermine Australian law and democracy .
The shadow attorney - general , George Brandis , described support for it as a " grave error " that could have " grave consequences " .
In fact , the problem is that the declaration does not do enough .
Rather than being law , it is merely a non-binding ( and thus unenforceable ) statement of values by the UN .
Even then , the declaration comes with major qualifications .
For example , Aborigines are said to " have the right to self - determination " .
However , the declaration says this must not be interpreted " as authorising or encouraging " anything that would undermine " the territorial integrity or political unity of sovereign and independent states " .
All of the Aboriginal rights must also be exercised in a way that respects the rights of others .
Others have lauded our support for the declaration , such as the Social Justice Commissioner , Tom Calma , who described it as a " watershed moment " in Australia 's relationship with its indigenous people .
While supporting the declaration will bolster the country 's international reputation , it will not do anything by itself to change the dismal state of Australian law .
This time it was supposed to be different .
Even as the world economy spiraled into a free fall , Latin America seemed not only poised to break the boom - bust cycle of the previous three decades — but to survive the debacle of 2008 .
With the economic expansion that started in 2003 , the region looked stronger than it had ever been , thanks largely to the structural reforms enacted as a result of previous crises .
Most national economies were more efficient and resilient .
Fiscal accounts had been put on a solid track .
Debt ratios had started to decline , and debt composition moved away from short duration and dollar denomination toward safer forms , such as long - term domestic currency debt .
Credit ratings improved , and a growing number of countries achieved investment–grade status , becoming at the same time less dependent on volatile capital inflows .
Decoupling was the fashionable concept in analysts ’ minds , as the region seemed unaffected by the first signs of trouble in the U.S. in 2007 .
With the price of food , energy and minerals buoyed by soaring growth in India and China , Latin America became the destination of choice for investments in these market sectors .
Alas , to apply the words of Brazilian samba composer Vinicius de Morais : “ Tristeza não tem fim , felicidade sim . ”
( Sadness has no end , but happiness certainly does . )
Just as Latin America was getting used to growth rates that topped 5 percent , the music stopped abruptly in the fourth quarter of 2008 .
The fabled decoupling disappeared and the so - called commodity super - cycle shrunk super - quickly .
Can Latin America , and the world , recover momentum ?
The answer is yes — but only by turning to the international financial institutions that have been largely ignored in the run-up to the present crisis .
A look at Latin America ’s own turbulent economic history over the past decades can help to explain why .
More Things Change , More They …
Never Mind
In the mid 1970s , skyrocketing commodity prices made Latin America a preferred destination for the ample international liquidity that Middle Eastern petrodollars and lax U.S. monetary policy funneled toward financial institutions .
That ended , however , in 1982 , with a debt crisis caused by a sudden cutback in global liquidity , as the U.S. tried to contain rampant inflation by slamming on the brakes of its monetary policy .
It took the better part of the 1980s — the so - called Lost Decade — to arrive at a new policy consensus : fiscal policy needed to become more austere and sustainable ; financial systems needed to be liberalized and reformed ; trade had to be opened up ; and state - owned enterprises needed to be privatized .
This agenda , together with the Brady Plan , was supposed to provide a way out of the debt crisis and revive growth .
And so it did — for a while .
The courageous market - oriented reforms enacted in countries like Argentina , Mexico , Colombia , Peru , Uruguay , and Venezuela fueled a boomlet in the early 1990s — only to collapse in late 1994 with the Tequila Crisis .
In hindsight , the growth seemed less a product of reform than of the temporary upsurge in short - term capital inflows brought about by the easing of Washington monetary policy during the 1990 – 92 U.S. recession .
As soon as the U.S. started to raise interest rates in 1994 , international liquidity tightened , and the region fell into currency and banking crises .
The boom - bust cycle continued through the early years of this century .
A wobbly recovery during 1996 and 1997 was followed by another commodity price collapse in 1998 .
Between 1998 and 2002 , which some refer to as the “ lost half - decade , ” the region was beset by a sequence of crises brought on once again by the drying - up of capital flows that occurred after the Russian 1998 crisis .
Still , after 2003 , there was reason to believe that this time it really would be different .
As the region started to run hefty current account surpluses , fueled by demand from China and India , Latin American countries seemed finally strong enough to finance their own market - led growth .
A small but significant number of countries used the terms - of - trade improvement of 2004–2008 to reassert state - led approaches and nationalize industries ranging from oil and gas to cement , steel , telecoms , pension funds , and banks .
But most of the region ’s countries used the good times to deepen their commitment to market - friendly approaches .
Even as the U.S. economy got into trouble in the summer of 2007 , the region kept moving ahead confidently .
Then , in the summer of 2008 , terms of trade collapsed .
As the global economy slowed down , the commodity price bubbles of 2007 burst .
Oil , copper , soy beans , iron ore , steel , and rice fell to 2004 levels .
Countries such as Argentina , Ecuador and Venezuela saw the yield on their bonds move above 20 percent , indicating an imminent probability of default .
The best Latin American corporations from the best countries in the region lost access to international finance .
Floating currencies such as the Brazilian real , and the Chilean , Colombian and Mexican pesos depreciated by over 40 percent .
In early 2009 , the IMF lowered its projected growth for Latin America to 1.1 percent for 2009 , down from 4.6 percent in 2008 .
With financial conditions deteriorating globally , especially after the collapse of Lehman Brothers , the region was hit by a sudden and quite massive reversal in capital inflows .
Growth slowed drastically as the region suffered simultaneous shocks to the terms of trade and to capital flows — a double blow not seen since 1982 .
The party , it seems , is over .
Or is it ?
The Only Way To Save Capitalism Is Capitalism
For those who consider global capitalism an unruly beast , the current crisis is additional proof that market - friendly policies lead to disaster .
Yet the alternatives have the distinction of being worse .
Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez likes to boast that his country is immune to the “ capitalist crisis ” because it has embraced twenty - first century socialism .
Nothing seems further from the truth .
Rather than demonstrate the intellectual failure of Latin American macroeconomic thinking , the crisis of 2008 –2009 confirms the value of the hard - earned lessons of the recent past .
Countries that adopted strongly counter - cyclical policies in boom times , as epitomized by Chile ’s 7 percent of GDP fiscal surplus in 2007 , are now able to adopt expansionary fiscal and monetary policies in order to cushion the fall .
In contrast , countries such as Venezuela that ran deficits in the boom years by expanding government spending and cutting taxes are now forced to contract even more , thus aggravating the crisis ’ impact on their economies .
Countries with floating exchange rates , such as Brazil , Colombia , Chile , Mexico , and Peru , are protected by the automatic depreciation of their currencies , thus softening the impact on the cash flow and the profitability of exporting and import - competing activities .
In contrast , countries that peg to the dollar , such as Argentina , Ecuador and Venezuela , are left in the uncomfortable situation of being unable to change relative prices with the U.S. at a time when they are massively losing competitiveness with their floating neighbors .
Argentina , in particular , seems to be repeating the mistakes of 1999 –2001 , when the depreciation of the Brazilian real coupled with U.S. dollar appreciation left it with the wrong parity at the wrong time .
The same can be said in comparing Venezuela with Colombia .
Whereas the Bolivarian revolution pegs to the dollar , its neighbor and second - largest trading partner floats .
It may not be a coincidence that the two Latin American countries that have led calls for the downfall of the Bretton Woods international financial institutions ( IFIs ) — Venezuela and Argentina — are suffering more than their market - friendly neighbors .
In February 2009 , Venezuela , with an international price of oil of $ 40 per barrel , was running a fiscal deficit close to an unheard - of 20 percent of GDP .
Argentina is facing an appreciation of its currency vis -à - vis its neighbors , a deterioration in its terms of trade , and the worst crop in 40 years .
For a government that has relied on extraordinary taxes on its agricultural exports to balance its public accounts , and has prided itself on its repeated defaults , Argentina now faces a fiscal hole and no access to finance .
The only hope for both countries is a quick recovery of the world economy .
But that , perhaps ironically , will require a stronger and more proactive role for IFIs .
This will not happen overnight .
The IFI arsenal must be restored by a recapitalization campaign , and multilaterals must learn to operate with the speed and flexibility to compensate quickly for the dramatic breakdown in private credit markets .
In the case of some IFIs , this shift may mean revisiting the business model to redesign — or in some cases , resurrect — some core institutional capabilities .
It seems likely that , as this crisis runs its course , market - friendly Latin American nations will do much better than their neopopulist and neoauthoritarian counterparts .
They may well do better than East Asia and especially Eastern Europe .
The lesson , in fact , is one that has global implications .
Remember When We Were Happy and Did n’t Know It ?
The growth that Latin America experienced in the 2003 –2007 period was not unique to the region ; it was worldwide .
The period constitutes the fastest and most broad - based global economic expansion in human history .
But they were also days of excess .
United States macro policy was amazingly lax .
An unpopular war led to very large fiscal deficits .
Monetary policy , buoyed by confidence that inflation had remained under control , was also unusually loose .
As a consequence , the external U.S. deficit skyrocketed to over 8 percent of GDP .
At the same time , China was pursuing an unsustainable growth strategy that saw its exports expand by over 20 percent per year , while its consumption grew at just over 7 percent .
The gap was expressed in a growing current account surplus that , in spite of the deteriorating terms of trade ( associated with the rising price of energy and minerals ) , went from about 1 percent of GDP in 2000 to an astounding 11 percent in 2008 .
This surplus led to an unprecedented accumulation of international reserves , invested mainly in U.S. Treasuries .
The large savings in China and later in the Middle East amply financed the growing U.S. deficit : instead of the U.S. facing increasing difficulties in covering its financial needs , long - term interest rates declined to historically low levels .
The best explanation to date for what happened was bad lending .
With large amounts of cash on hand , financial institutions needed to find new ways of lending the money out , or new people to lend it to .
This involved taking on much more risk than would have been prudent , at a time when the financial industry had become concentrated in terms of players , and more leveraged and more globally diversified in terms of assets .
If problems arose , they would quickly become systemically large and have global impact .
Enter the Super - Borrowers
When the fan belt of a car breaks , the engine overheats , seizes and stops .
But a new fan belt is not the solution at this point .
If Wall Street is the belt , Main Street is the engine .
Since the engine has seized , even fully capitalized banks will be wary of lending in a downturn , and firms and households would be unwise to borrow , even if credit were available .
Credit crunches often lead to recessions , but the eventual recovery has never been lead by credit .
1
The investors ’ flight to quality means that those issuing the safe assets are left as the sole remaining super - borrowers .
These super - borrowers — the U.S. and Japan , mainly — are the only ones left to reestablish financial links and rewire the system .
It ’s ironic .
Excesses in the U.S. financial system caused a crisis that raised the attractiveness of the dollar and of U.S. Treasuries , increasing the de facto financial power of the country that was probably most responsible for the advent of the crisis .
While Latin American governments lose access to finance at the first sign of trouble , preventing them from playing a stabilizing and constructive role during crises , the U.S. Treasury finds itself able to borrow more money at better terms than ever before .
How Should This Super - Borrower Advantage Be Used ?
Up to now , two methods have been employed : propping up aggregate demand directly through fiscal reflation — the $ 780 billion of fiscal stimulus approved in February 2009 — and recapitalizing the banking system through the $ 700 billion Troubled Assets Recovery Program ( TARP ) and its likely additional successors .
History will determine the wisdom of these decisions .
The economics profession in the U.S. has made an implicit commitment not to repeat the mistakes of 1929 .
Fiscal and monetary policies are as expansionary as anybody would have thought imaginable , so as to err on the other side of Hoover .
But what are the likely mistakes of 2009 that policymakers and economists during the next crisis will be trying to avoid ?
One possible candidate is the fact that the recapitalization and reflation is planned mainly for the U.S. domestic economy , while the problem and the borrowed resources are global .
The current strategy constitutes an attempt to restart the global economy through a widening of the U.S. external deficit .
Clearly , this is not the best way forward because it tries to solve one problem by aggravating another .
It may cushion the fall now , but it will slow down the recovery later .
If current trends continue , by 2011 , the U.S. balance sheet will look pretty weak , given all the additional debt .
Tax rates will need to go up , as is currently planned through the expiration of the Bush tax cuts .
If by then the recession is not over , investors will feel much less sanguine about U.S. Treasuries and the super - borrower power may evaporate .
It seems reasonable to assume that if the crisis is global , the solution must also have a global character , even if the world has just a few super - borrower nations .
A more sustainable alternative is to use the super - borrower capacity to reflate the global economy and to re-establish financial links globally .
This would imply using the capacity to borrow to buy financial assets abroad , thus allowing other countries to expand their spending and investment .
Through this approach , the balance sheet of the U.S. does not get worse : the additional debt is balanced by additional claims on foreigners , and the interest - rate differential will make the U.S. taxpayer better off .
The additional foreign spending would seep into the U.S. through higher American exports , thus stimulating the economy in a more sustainable manner .
How To Get It Done
Global reflation can be accomplished in several ways .
First , multilateral development banks should be recapitalized by having countries subscribe to new issues of callable capital ( i.e. , de facto guarantees ) .
This will allow the IFIs to raise funds in global capital markets , which they can then lend to the credit - starved developing world .
For Latin America , this would imply a recapitalized World Bank and Inter - American Development Bank ( IDB ) .
The goal is for these institutions to be able to lend enough money to partially compensate for the lost access to private markets .
Loans should be disbursed quickly and conditional only on an assessment beforehand of the soundness of the country ’s macro stance .
They should be made in an amount sufficient to prevent the inefficient , procyclical contractionary fiscal adjustment that is being caused by the lack of access to finance .
For the world , a program of about $ 700 billion — already a familiar number — would be more or less of the right size .
Second , part of the capital raised could be channeled through institutions such as the International Finance Corporation in order to purchase a diversified portfolio of private emerging market assets .
This would provide a support mechanism for this asset class similar to the relief that the Fed is providing to private American assets .
Third , the IMF should also be recapitalized , possibly through an issuance of Special Drawing Rights ( SDRs ) , in order to ensure that the organization has more than enough funds to help reconnect countries to finance .
But the issue is not just to fund individual countries in trouble .
The goal should be to convince safe countries that are currently hoarding large amounts of international reserves as self - insurance against future crises that they need not sit on so much liquidity because they will have ample access to contingent IMF funds .
This will allow countries to adopt policies that are more supportive of a global reflation effort .
In some sense , it would just be a formalized and multilateral version of the strategy that the Fed announced in November 2008 , whereby it granted swap lines in the amount of 30 billion dollars each to Korea , Singapore , Mexico , and Brazil .
To make sure that this facility is used from the start , emerging market members of the G - 20 and others with high credit ratings should simultaneously ask for these new resources in order to dispel the stigma that is usually attached to borrowing from the IMF .
A lot of effort has been invested in discussing issues such as global imbalances and the voting rights at the international financial institutions , but too little has been dedicated to thinking about what these institutions should do in the context of the current global crisis .
If capital markets are impaired over a long period , global and regional international institutions need to play a much bigger role in the recovery than is currently being envisioned .
If this strategy is successful , it will lead to a more balanced and sustainable global recovery .
It will also strengthen the case for market democracy in the eyes of Latin American voters .
The current crisis may be the worst recession the United States has seen in 80 years , but most Latin Americans alive today have suffered equivalent financial catastrophes .
We have also survived it .
We have learned the advantages of open economies , sound fiscal policies , flexible exchange rates , and respect for markets and property rights .
We have also seen the value of international financial institutions .
These institutions were principal actors during previous crises and helped to restore liquidity and growth when that task was beyond the capacity of individual countries .
They used multilateral mechanisms to solve financial problems — and invested political , financial and intellectual capital in creating the changes that will go a long way toward helping many countries in the region weather the current storm .
Their experience in Latin America offers a template for a way forward for a world in crisis .
With a little tweaking of the model , recapitalized , reformulated and stronger IFIs could play a vital role in global recovery .

Comedy legend Robin Williams has cancelled four stand - up shows in Florida amid fears for his health .
A statement on the actor 's website said : " Williams was experiencing shortness of breath and is currently being evaluated by doctors who are recommending a week of rest . "
Health fears ... Robin Williams has been rushed to hospital .
The four performances of Williams ' tour are being rescheduled .

Williams is renowned worldwide for his madcap style of stand - up comedy , which has also characterised his long and successful movie career .
In recent years he has also made a name for himself as a serious actor , winning an Oscar for best supporting actor for his performance in .
The prime minister made clear he expected such transparency in a meeting yesterday with Labour chief whip Geoff Hoon .
The move , in the wake of the Derek Conway controversy , was announced after Cameron today appeared to lead efforts for greater transparency by conducting a survey that reveals more than 70 Tory MPs employ members of their family .
The shadow cabinet has now been asked by Cameron to declare in the register of members ' interests any relatives they employ from the beginning of the new financial year on April 1 .
Cameron said : " We have carried out a ring - round among almost all the Conservative members of parliament and there are just over 70 who employ husbands or wives or family members .
" There is a need for greater transparency and greater openness when it comes to MPs ' pay and MPs ' staff and the use of the expenses and allowances .
" As the first step , I will be asking my frontbench colleagues from April 1 to register ... if they do employ a member of their family . "
The move is designed to draw a line under the Conway debacle and restore credibility to the party .
The disgraced Tory MP was suspended from parliament for ten days yesterday over excessive payments to his son at taxpayers ' expense .
" I believe the public are right to demand more transparency and openness when it comes to MPs ' staff , pay , allowances and expenses " , said Cameron .
" As a first step I will ensure that from the start of the new financial year ( 1st April 2008 ) all Conservative front bench MPs must declare if they employ family members in the register of members interests .
I hope all other Conservative MPs will follow suit .
" This is the first in a number of steps we need to take to reassure people that members of parliament work hard for their constituents and are honest and open in their spending of public money . "
The prime minister yesterday backed calls for more transparency in the spending of MPs ' taxpayer - funded allowances .
Brown 's official spokesman said today : " The prime minister has already made clear in his discussions with the chief whip that all Labour MPs , not just the frontbenchers , should be open and transparent about the staff who are working for them and , in light of the scandal involving Mr Conway , that includes identifying any family members .
" But the important thing is not just that the staff are registered and identified appropriately but that they are doing the job for which they are funded by the taxpayer .
" That 's what Mr Cameron and his party have previously failed to recognise . "
Brown is expected to meet Labour 's parliamentary committee on Wednesday to discuss the ways in which MPs ' spending could be made more transparent .
MPs are responsible for recruiting staff to help them in their parliamentary work , and many employ spouses or other relatives to work on their team .
But the practice came under the spotlight this week after it emerged that Conway paid his son Freddie £ 45,000 over two - and - a - half years while he was studying full - time at Newcastle University .
MPs endorsed the recommendation of the Commons Standards and Privileges Committee to suspend Conway and order him to repay £ 13,161 .
The standards commissioner , John Lyon , is considering a new complaint against Conway concerning his elder son Henry , who is said to have received £ 32,000 for research work .
Police are meanwhile considering a complaint that Conway committed offences under the Fraud Act .
Conway said on Wednesday he would stand down from the Old Bexley and Sidcup constituency at the next election .
A Taiwanese man became a sitting target for a snake , which bit his penis as sat on the toilet at his rural home .
" As soon as he sat down , he suddenly felt a knife - like pain and reacted instinctively by standing up , " the China Times reported on Monday .
" When he looked down , he saw the big snake . "
The 51 - year - old man , from Nantou County , was under medical care with minor injuries , a director at Puli Christian Hospital said .
" As soon as he has passed the risk of infection , he can go , " the director , who declined to be named , said .
Local television images showed the black and yellow reptile , reportedly a species of rat snake , being uncoiled and plucked slowly from the toilet bowl .
Snakes regularly enter rural homes in Taiwan and other sub-tropical regions of Asia .

Burt Blumert died of cancer today .
He was 80 years old .
I first met him , I think , in 1965 .
He was a close friend of R. J. Rushdoony , who had been on the staff of the Center for American Studies , an extension of the William Volker Fund .
The Volker Fund was in Burlingame , California .
So was Burt ’s coin store , the Camino Coin Company .
Rushdoony began buying gold coins from him sometime around 1964 .
The Camino Coin Company has been a fixture in the hard money movement for four decades .
Burt retired in 2008 , transferring ownership to an old customer .
The store was never big .
It had only a handful of salesmen .
He knew that the hard money movement was not huge , because he knew so many of the people who actually bought coins for their gold content .
We met at a 1965 meeting that Rushdoony held at San Marino , California , an upscale suburb of Los Angeles .
Rushdoony had asked Burt to bring coins to sell .
Burt did .
He sold a lot of coins that day .
Overnight , he became the largest volume coin dealer in the West Coast .
There were not many non-collector coin buyers in 1965 .
I had been brought in to speak , as I recall .
I had been working with Rushdoony , on and off , since the summer of 1963 .
I was in graduate school .
Burt and I hit it off from the beginning .
That was true of everyone who knew Burt , as far as I ever knew .
He was truly gregarious .
He was not a high - pressure salesman .
He always had a new joke to tell .
They were clean jokes .
They were n’t great jokes , but they were in endless supply .
He knew more about the day - to - day coin markets than anyone I ever met .
He had no grandiose theory of why metals prices went down or up on any given day or month .
But he believed that the Federal Reserve would eventually resort to inflation to keep the system going .
He was amazed at the longevity of the fiat money system .

For ten years there were credible investigators and investors telling federal regulatory agencies that Bernard Madoff could not be doing what he claimed to be doing , and that in all probability that he was running a Ponzi scheme .
The federal agencies either ignored these accusations or made superficial forays into Mr. Madoff ’s affairs and accepted his explanations for his claimed prowess as an investor and money manager , serving the famous and wealthy .
I feel their pain .
For ten years we have been telling anyone who would listen that the ticket camera industry is a scam , that traffic signal management is a disaster , and the combination of the two is culminating in a huge rip off of the driving public .
Furthermore , that government greed and the private sector profit motive have teamed up to make our roads less safe by increasing accidents at controlled intersections .
Like Bernie Madoff , these governments and corporations denied our claims and trotted out supposed studies that show ticket cameras are reducing accidents .
In every instance where a relatively unbiased third party investigated these “ studies ” they found fraud , manipulation , and outright misrepresentation of the data .
The real results verified our claims ;
Ticket cameras increase intersection traffic accidents .
They do this in two ways :
First , they cause motorists to take unexpected measures , usually abrupt braking , to avoid a traffic ticket .
Second , they discourage making improvements to traffic signals , and their operation , if those improvements will reduce revenue generation from the cameras .
When finally embarrassed to take action , the federal government ( the same agency that had been promoting ticket cameras ) gathered up a collection of mostly shady or self - serving reports from the same governments already caught cooking the books and reported that overall , ticket cameras improved highway safety ( like Bernie Madoff was running a legitimate business ) .
When told of flaws and omissions in the underlying studies the response was usually silence .
( For example , a frequently - cited study from Virginia attributed significant reductions to red light violations and subsequent safety improvements to a ticket camera installation , but “ forgot ” to mention the improvements occurred after yellow light durations were increased . )
Every independent study of red light ticket cameras has found that they increase intersection accidents .
Every study by an institution or government with a vested interest in promoting ticket cameras has been rife with inconsistencies , untenable assumptions , and / or outright manipulation to generate pre-ordained results .
And , in the latter case they have almost always been caught in the act !
Never - the - less the ruse continues .
Local officials claim the cameras are going up to improve safety and catch dangerous red light runners .
If outside restraints — say mandated minimum yellow light standards — significantly reduce revenue generation , the cameras come down , safety be damned !
( Apparently . )
The overriding question is how many times does it have to be proven that ticket cameras do not improve traffic safety , that they are in fact a detriment to traffic safety , and the only reason governments are installing these systems is to generate revenue from entrapped motorists ?
When will the press finally catch on ?
When will state legislators eliminate the authority that allows local units of government to install and exploit ticket cameras ?
Bernie Madoff has been found out , how about turning a little attention to the ticket camera scam , ten years is long enough to ignore this crime .
Looking back it was possibly one of the most bizarre decisions I 've made , but it all turned out well and enjoyed myself thoroughly .
It was a Thursday or Friday night and as I was sat at home feeling a bit bored as there was nothing to look forward to on the TV and big brother had just finished , I logged on to one of the sites I use on a regular basis to find I had mail waiting , so , I went straight to my mail box to see what I 'd been sent .
Turned out to be a mail shot from the site operators telling me all about how the changes they 'd recently made to the forums of the site had made a huge impact on the number of posts being placed so I decided to go take a look at what all the fuss was about .
I read through some of the general posts from people asking for advice and then came across a post from a girl I 've chatted to before in the chat room about a Bukkake party she was having and asking if there were any other girls that fancied coming along for some fun .
It was n't something I 'd ever really considered and I was n't too sure about what went on at a bukkake party so I jumped into the chat room to see if she was still about and to have a chat .
Turned out I 'd missed her by a few minutes so I dropped her a mail asking her to either drop me a mail by return or give me a call
It was n't long before I got a text asking if it was ok t call , I replied that it was , and she phoned straight away .
Carol was a lot more experienced than me in the scene and I knew she arranged parties etc. at her home , I just did n't know what sort lol
We chatted for a while and she explained about the cummings ( sorry , could n't resist ) and goings of a bukkake party .
I love being the centre of attention so I thought I might enjoy it , but I was feeling slightly nervous about it so Carol suggested I simply come along and see what I thought to it all with no pressure to join in .
This sounded like a great idea and as I was free on the following Saturday night , I got the address details and made my plans to attend .
I had a look around the internet and read up a bit more about the subject of bukkake and the growing trend for bukkake parties in the UK and the more I read the more turned on I got at the thought of all those men wanking themselves all over me .

Money Morning / The Money Map Report
Wall Street created the U.S. housing bubble and now it 's missing the real estate rebound .
And Andrew Waite understands why .
Waite is the publisher of the Personal Real Estate Investor , a glossy magazine that focuses on investors who buy houses or condos to manage for income or to fix up and sell for a profit .
But he 's not some industry cheerleader whose statements are nothing but spin .
He 's a true expert on the U.S. housing sector who goes out of his way to " educate " journalists about the true state of the American housing market , and who criticizes most of the " indicators " in use as useless and irrelevant .
Plus , as a onetime Wall Street venture - capitalist who subsequently joined Silicon Valley 's Sand Hill Road private equity crowd , Waite really understands how the Wall Street investment game is played – and , in the case of the U.S. housing market , the missteps Wall Street made and why .
" Wall Street analysts and economists do not understand the housing industry , " Waite told Money Morning in a recent interview .
" While stocks and bonds are relatively simple to analyze , housing is anything but .
Unlike stocks , housing is a non-tradable asset . "
But through the creation of mortgage - backed securities , Wall Street tried to transform housing into a tradable asset .
That lack of understanding set the stage for the housing bubble .
And it 's the same miscalculation that is keeping the big - money crowd from understanding that the housing market may have already bottomed – and may well be on its way back up .
Let 's look at both miscues .
Building a Bubble
Stocks and bonds are " tradable assets . "
They trade on central exchanges – in a very efficient manner – and play well into the kind of mathematical averaging that paves the way for all sorts of indices ( the Standard & Poor 's 500 Index ) , and sub-indices ( the Dow Jones Transportation Index ) .
That 's not the case with housing , which is very granular in nature – meaning how housing does in one neighborhood differs greatly from how it does in another .
Housing is a " non-traded " asset because it is hard to trade – and when it does trade does so in a highly inefficient market .
As Waite says , housing is referred to as " real " property for a reason :
Unlike stocks or bonds , which are paper representations of the underlying asset , housing is the asset itself .
People live in houses , and most do n't buy them as investments – they buy them to live in .
The typical house is owned for five to seven years , and only about 5 % of the U.S. housing stock turns over in a single year .
In a " normal " period – by that , I mean a stretch that 's not artificially souped up by the unrealistically loose credit that led up to the subprime - mortgage debacle – prices escalate perhaps 3 % to 4 % annually .
And there are n't the whipsaw pricing patterns that we see with stocks .
Even so , as part of its mission to transform housing into a tradable asset , Wall Street designed a reporting system that , true to form , was badly flawed , Waite says .
The measures applied to the market – sample size , methodology , and statistical presentation – work well for assets that are dynamically traded , as stocks are .
But they do n't work for housing :
Stocks are analyzed by looking at the underlying company 's fundamentals , meaning the conclusions reached are very much tied to the specific earnings power of that firm .
Housing , by comparison , is analyzed make " illogical " generalizations about the market that fail to reflect reality .
Stocks are analyzed in a forward - looking fashion , being all about earnings projections and expectations .
Housing analysis ends up being backward looking ( 45 days to 180 days ) , meaning the conclusions that are reached are likely outdated by the time we see them .
Housing ends up being treated like a commodity , with " five - star " neighborhoods ( where sales are brisk and the asking price is now being exceeded as prospective purchasers bid the values up in hopes of landing the house ) being " averaged in " with " disastrous " one - star neighborhoods .
Says Waite : " Housing indexes and statistics emanating from Wall Street take a cynical view of housing … and they misrepresent the actual value of housing by ignoring the critically obvious point – most housing purchases are ‘ buy , occupy and hold ' , " and are n't a speculative play aimed at short - term profits .
By misfiring so badly , Wall Street established an environment in which housing prices were expected to escalate at better - than - their - historical norms , fanning the speculative flames .
The easy credit made available by the mortgage - backed debt market only made matters worse .
Banks made loans , and Wall Street bundled those loans into an asset - backed security – giving the banks back the cash that they could then use to make their next round of loans .
Because the loans were " averaged " out , the resultant securities were given the highest credit ratings by the ratings agencies – which was more than the securities deserved .
It was a recipe for disaster – or , at least , for a bubble .
Wall Street never saw it coming .
Anatomy of a Rebound
Wall Street has also failed to understand the dynamics of a housing market recovery – which is already in the works , Waite says .
And he should know .
The portion of the real estate market that Waite 's magazine caters to – the real estate investor – is significant .
In fact , a groundbreaking study commissioned by the magazine , and conducted by real - estate researcher REALTrends Inc. , in concert with Harris Interactive , found that real estate investors account for 22 % to 28 % of all home sales ( existing and new ) each year – a total of 1.5 million to 1.64 million houses each year .
That 's a big piece of a $ 300 billion industry , so it provides a very solid sample .
According to Waite , the housing market bottomed last year .
But that bottoming takes place in stages .
Housing values continue to decline .
But values can't bottom , solidify , and then head north until sales volumes increase , Waite says .
" First you get volume , and then you get valuations , " Waite says .
And it does n't get better across the board all at once : Sales will improve in a " predictable sequence " that start with the very best neighborhoods , work their way down to the really good neighborhoods , and finally reach the plain old good developments .
As noted , Waite says the very best neighborhoods are already seeing strongly improved sales , with actual bidding battles taking place as prospective buyers willingly pay more than the asking price in order to land the choicest properties .
As those markets sell out , and the credit spigots open , demand will move from the very best neighborhoods down to the " pretty good " residential properties , Waite says .
Three reports released over the course of three straight days the last week of March seem to support Waite 's view .
Sales of new homes rose 4.7 % in February – the first increase in seven months , the U.S. Commerce Department reported March 26 .
The day before that report came out a government gauge of home prices posted its first gain in almost a year .
And the third of that " hat trick " of upbeat reports issued that same week said that sales of previously owned homes – the biggest share of the market – also increased in February .
The plunge in housing prices is also starting to have an effect .
In a second report issued March 26 , the California Association of Realtors said that existing - home sales in the state were up 83 % in February from the previous year .
The reason :
The median home price was down roughly 40 % , which is helping shrink inventories to about a six months ' supply from 15 months in 2008 .
If Waite 's theory is correct , as sales of new and existing homes pick up on a month - to - month basis , prices will follow .
But true to form , Wall Street is demanding proof .
The data " have allayed some fears that the housing market would continue to freefall , " Omair Sharif , an economist with RBS Greenwich Capital , told The Wall Street Journal .
" But it 's way too early to say if we 've hit bottom . "
But Waite fervently believes that bottom has already been hit and that it's all uphill – over the long haul – from here .
" Wall Street would have you believe that putting money into a house is as sophisticated as putting money in a mattress , " he said .
" But as it continues to prove , nothing could be further from the truth . "

Online retailer Amazon has entered the pre-owned videogames market , with the beta launch of a new service .
Users send Amazon their games , and in return are issued a gift card for a pre-arranged amount .
The retailer already allows users to sell their own games through the site , but this is the first time Amazon has taken a more active role .
On PlayStation 3 titles , Amazon is currently offering users USD 33 for Capcom 's Street Fighter IV , and at the other end of the scale , USD 9 for Ubisoft 's Far Cry 2 .
Amazon is the latest retailer to jump on the pre-owned market , traditionally an area for specialist games stores .
In the US Toys R Us has begun trialling a service , while the UK's HMV launched its second hand offering last year .
GO FIGURE
Different ways of seeing stats
Do MPs think they are poor ?
Some who have stuck up for them in the expenses saga say they are underpaid .
In his weekly column , Michael Blastland looks at how their income compares with that of Mr and Mrs Typical .
What 's a typical person 's weekly income in the UK ?
About £ 390 after tax and benefits , adjusted for household income * .
That 's for a two - adult household without children .
How did I get the figure - it 's the median average , which is a technical way of saying it 's roughly the figure in the middle of all incomes .
Have a look at the graph below :
It shows roughly how we stack up .
The vertical scale shows how many people are at each £ 10 interval - so for example about 1.3 million have between £ 270 - £ 280 a week .
About 4 % are off the graph , which stops at £ 1,100 to keep the scale practical .
Now , where do MPs fit in to this picture ?
The figures take account of household composition .
So let 's take an MP living with a non-working partner , the kids grown up and gone , and no other income .
Look at the graph below .
If we treat MPs ' expenses as income then the average expenses alone would place the MP household above about 30 % of the population or 17 million individuals .
On salary alone , the MP 's household is above about 91 % of the population - 55 million individuals .
About 9 % have household incomes higher than this .
And lump them both together ( salary and expenses ) - our honourable member sits above about 96 % of the population - 58 million individuals .
A working partner would push them higher still .
Have MPs , of all people , lacked a sense of how most voters live , of what these amounts would mean to the majority ?
And does this help explain public anger ?
I wonder if they found themselves in the expenses mess because , bluntly , they think they are poor .
Perhaps they do feel poor compared with many of those they meet .
MPs work hard and could probably earn more doing something else .
So could many people .
The poorest we can make the MP appear in the population at large is to remove the expenses , continue to assume one income only for a two - adult household and give them three teenage children .
That puts them roughly in the middle of the distribution , after adjusting for family circumstances .
So are MPs badly paid ?
We have to ask on whose scale .
Not by the standards of half the population or more , for whom they are rich .
The top 5 % might think otherwise , and perhaps it 's those people we want in the job .
Where should they be in the distribution ?
You tell us .
*
The figures here are based on the Institute for Fiscal Studies ' online calculator Where Do You Fit In ? .
It uses - in our case - an approximate measure of income after direct taxes ( income tax , national insurance and council tax ) and benefits .
This is thought to give the best measure of how much people have left to spend .
It is based on household income rather than individual income to allow for the fact that someone in the same family might have no income of their own but share their partners ' .
This income is also then adjusted to take account of household composition .
So it is assumed , for example , that a couple living together needs 50 per cent more than a single person to achieve the same standard of living .
A family with children needs more money again to reach the same standard of living .
This is known as equivalisation .
The IFS site offers more details .
The charts in our example of an MP with a partner but no dependent children have adjusted all other households by equivalisation , so that they are comparable .
Below is a selection of your comments .
It would be interesting to see how this compares to London incomes and / or jobs where significant managerial impact or strategic understanding is required .
It would also be interesting to look at how well educated MP's are in comparison to the population and how their income compares to their peers in this respect .
Andrew Wallin , London
In my eyes , what the MPs have been doing is basically fraud .
Why should they be allowed to go unpunished !?
Al , Leeds , UK Perfect demonstration of how out of touch MPs are from the people they represent .
It would be interesting to see whether the day to day decisions they take on behalf of millions of ordinary people would be different if they themselves had to deal with job insecurity , rising cost of living and a general feeling of being continually squeezed for more and more money .
Out of touch and out - dated - hopefully things will change to align them with us ordinary folk who pay for their comfortable lifestyles .
The government needs to be run more like the thousands of companies in the UK and not the secretive club it appears to have been .
Jonathan , London
More pertinent here is the mode , which is the peak of the curve .
this represents the income which comes to the largest fraction of people and so is more representative of a " typical " person .
Matt £ 60 K for one of the most important jobs in the country ?
An absolute pittance .
The average company director makes far more than that , and there are tens of thousands of them .
How many doctors over the age of 35 make less than that - lawyers , bankers - any senior professional outside the underpaid caring professions .
Pay them all £ 100 K / year , let them expense office costs like any business would , and that will work .
If they want a second home , the House of Commons rents one for them .
James , Cambridge
If MPs are that far removed from the average in the population , how are they meant to represent us ?
Chris , Bristol I do n't think that it 's unreasonable to expect them to be in a higher bracket of earnings when you line them up next to the Great British Public .
I do however find it particularly distasteful that they do earn more and yet all those people in the £ 200 / week bracket who struggle to pay their bills and feed their family are apparently also responsible for paying for MP home upkeep .
If the MPs who over claimed can afford to pay it back then surely that means they did n't really need the money in the first place ?
But good job , there is a single mother somewhere who could n't eat because she had to feed her kids and fix your toilet seat .
James Reynolds , Hatfield , England
For all their faults , MPs are not typical people , are they ?
You do n't get selected as an MP unless you are pretty exceptional in the first place .
A more relevant point is what they could earn in the private sector .
This does n't excuse the whole expenses furore , but is a more relevant comparison .
Andy , London
This looks about right .
They are paid in the top end , which will hopefully will attract the best people to their job .
And their expenses , once tidied up and locked down a bit , will pay for their secretaries and office staff to communicate with their constituents and follow the sheer volume of legislation that is done .
Ed C , Reading , UK If an MP has a working partner that will push their income higher , true , but that applies to everyone else in the population too !!
An the whole point of their expenses is to compensate for the extra cost of running two homes and two offices so should n't be taken into account when comparing income , unless maybe one can find an interesting way to compare it with divorced families .
How much would one person have to earn if they were divorced , their ex-husband or wife does n't work , and they need to support two homes at the sort of level someone doing public service as an elected representative probably deserves ?
Rolf Howarth , Stratford - upon - Avon
You would expect someone to be at the top of their game in order to become an MP .
Successfull shop stewards , doctors , lawyers , businessmen etc .
These sort of people are already on high salaries , so if you want to entice them in to politics you have to give them high salaries .
Otherwise you end up with a lot of dross .
But hold on - we pay politicians loads and most of them are dross anyway !
Bang goes my theory .
Simon , London
So where do they fall when compared to people required ( by their job ) to maintain two houses ?
Lets compare apples with apples here .
The expenses are ( supposed to be ) for the purpose of ensuring that their ( rather unique ) work does n't leave them out of pocket .
I think they are underpaid .
I want the best quality individuals doing this job .
I can't , however , guarantee that I 'm going to get the best quality individual - because I live in a democracy , not a meritocracy .
Peter Carswell , London
It is obvious that MP 's have lost sense of reality .
As rightly said they feel poor in comparison of the people they deal on a day to day basis , but to have a £ 77 K basic salary is not given to everybody .
The fact is that rules allowed them to do so but morality defy the rules so , in my opinion , MP 's knew it was wrong but they truly believe that they are a class above the normal class .
The work they are doing is not of great difficulty and if you were to put in relation to any other work , they would be paid around £ 35 - 40 k a year and might be able to claim expenses if they are lucky .
I think someone should stand up and tell MP's to come back to reality and stop being patronising and arrogant .
Anthony , Warwick " MPs work hard and could probably earn more doing something else ? "
A few maybe , but I think we have seen that a large number are absolutely " unfit for purpose " !
Admad , Crawley Down , West Sussex
The chart makes it very apparent that MPs are earning handsome salaries without their expenses .
Perhaps
MPs should have a look at the chart for themselves .
Another interesting comparison might be MPs pay compared against other public sector workers .
I would love to know how their pay has risen over the last 10 years compared to say nurses .
Mark Dooney , London
MPs should be paid the national average wage - whatever it is .
It 's then in their best interests too to get the wages up for the whole country and improve cost of living etc if they have to live on the same budget as everyone else .
Em , Coventry
Their salary is probably about right .
They work hard at all hours in responsible jobs .
What has seriously angered people is the near fraudulent playing of expenses , flipping properties etc .
MPs seem to think saying sorry is enough .
Its time at least 100 of them went to prison for fraud and tax evasion .
Nigel Evans , Blackpool MPs should have been paid more than the £ 64 K they are earn at present .
They have been told to think of the expenses as part of their wage and spent it accordingly .
I doubt whether they thought of it as taypayers money rather than their own earned cash .
People earning big wages pay big taxes too .
Some of them could no doubt earn more in other jobs .
So off they go !
Let 's see what sort of people are elected now .
BNP ?
Greens ?
Television presenters ?
Julia Quinn , Durham
If their salaries were lower , putting them in the median people would be much more understanding of expenses claims for second homes , travel and entertaining .
With such vast salaries , compared with the average person , it seems reasonable they should consider these costs as already included in their pay .
I 'm on about £ 125 a week and work in the public sector .
A tighter grip on their purse strings might help me to loosen mine just a little !!
Adam Kidd , Brighton MPs are the people running our country and holding the government to account - in order to attract the right calibre of people they should be in top 5 % of your graph .
They should be paid properly ( say £ 100,000 for a backbench MP ) and have a much stricter expenses regime .
We do not want to go back to the times when only the independently wealthy could afford to be an MP .

( Recasts with vaccine order )
CANBERRA , May 26 ( Reuters ) - Australia 's government ordered 10 million doses of swine flu vaccine being developed by pharmaceutical company CSL Ltd CSL .
AX on Thursday as the number of confirmed H1N1 cases in Australia topped 100 .
Health Minister Nicola Roxon said the government would also buy a further 1.6 million courses of antiviral drug Relenza to bolster the national stockpile to 10.3 million courses of anti-viral drugs .
“ We are working very hard to contain this , ” Roxon told reporters in Canberra , where she confirmed the number of H1N1 cases had climbed from 61 on Wednesday to 103 by Thursday .
Most cases were in Australia ’s most populous states of New South Wales and Victoria in the country ’s south east , which are heading into the southern winter and regular flu season .
Of the confirmed cases , three are on a cruise liner , the Pacific Dawn , which will now return to a major port rather than continue with its planned voyage north to the state of Queensland .
Roxon said CSL expects its H1N1 vaccine to be ready within a few months , with the company planning to start clinical trials to make sure the vaccine is safe and effective for human use .
The supply would cover just less than half of Australia ’s 21 million people , but Roxon said medical authorities would priorities which areas and people would most need the vaccine .
The government has also approved the first release of anti-viral drugs from the national stockpile , with 7,500 doses of paediatric Tamiflu to be relased in the Victoria and Western Australia states , and 10,000 packets of Tamiflu to Victoria .
“ These localised releases from the stockpile will enable aggressive containment of small clusters of the disease , ” Roxon said .
Libel laws can be used to stifle legitimate scientific debate
CHALLENGING the scientific validity of a product or claim can be fraught with danger .
Increasingly , such challenges are leaving scientists and science writers facing an expensive libel action before the English high court .
Many individuals and publications have been threatened with libel actions , and some have had proceedings launched against them .
Many more writers have had their work edited before publication to avoid any risk of such legal action .
Though the court ’s jurisdiction extends only to England and Wales , these actions can threaten scientists and writers wherever they live and work .

The story : Let me first point out that this was probably the most surreal drug experience Ive ever had .
This was largely due to the multitude of drug clichés that epitomized the night .
I showed up at my friends place for a quiet night of poker and conversation .
In total , there were 4 of us ( Mr. I , myself , Ms. M and Mrs. I ) .
After a brief discussion we decided to scrap poker in lieu of a 2C - I experiment .
This was the virgin trip for each of us .
Mrs. I was the sober sitter , Ms. M ingested 6 mg , Mr. I ingested 11 mg , and I ingested 15 mg ( 22:00 ) T+00:00
We took our capsules and each emptied them into a cup of heated water .
Added to each cup was 1 package of emergenC brand powdered vitamin drink .
We sat Around the kitchen table and talked , waiting for the first alert .
T+00:15 The first alert is announced by Mr. I .
He calls them the acid tingles .
Music is chosen .
3 CDs .
The choices included some jazz , some drum & bass , and ambient compilation stuff ( it was later decided that overly wordy music provided too much additional stimulus for our environment , but I will explain below ) .
Conversation was good and the discussion revolved around the art gallery opening where we had spend the earlier part of the evening .
T+00:45 Ms. M remarks that she is feeling a subtle MDMA - like rush , and some jittery amphetamine like stimulation .
I feel a + and a definite trend toward more .
Mr. I is now outside smoking a cigarette and talking on his roof deck about the future of humanity , and about debt slavery .
When he finishes his cigarette the lightbulbs in the house are all swapped out for colored bulbs .
The house is now bathed in alternating colors of green and red and purple and blue .
A black light is turned on in the kitchen .
T+01:15 Holy shit !
The others are still acending slowly .
I am exstatic !
I experience intense waves of MDMA - like pleasure jolts ( without the extreme empathic component ) as I continue to climb toward a peak .
Very amphetamine like in character .
Visual Hallucinations slowly begin .
Shadows are ill defined and seem to waver in density like smoke in a slow breeze .
The awareness of colors is directly related to the discussion at hand .
Mr. I mentions the devil several times and each time I become particularly aware of swirling red glow pouring over his face .
The lightbulb directly over his head was red .
Why hadnt this seemed important before ?
He hadnt mentioned the devil before .
T+01:30 Mr. I has decided to read poetry out loud .
He wanders through the house spouting Elliot , Coleridge , Pound & Williams .
Ms. M mentions that she has just downloaded Ginsbergs Howl .
The music in the background / foreground ?
interlaces with Mr. Is voice and the asthetic for the evening is set .
I feel like I 'm trapped in an Oliver Stone movie .
Vibrant colors from the rugs in the living room strike me as more present and more relevant than usual .
Music is exchanged for ginsberg and after a few stanzas we realize that Mr. Ginsberg sounds robotic .
The music is returned .
T+02:00 Despite my SIGNIFICANT intoxication +++ , I feel very comfortable cognitively .
There are no thought loops as with LSD .
Occasionally some abstract thinking enters my mental arena and I lose focus on the stimulus around me .
I am vaguely aware of Ms. M .
She remarks how wonderful the steam heat from the radiator feels .
There is a very sexual push to this .
Sober , I am not very attracted to Ms. M , but I would like to touch her now .
Mr. I lets his rabbit loose from its cage .
He is ++/+++. T+02:15
The rabbit appears out of thin air in several different rooms as I am sitting or moving .
I laugh at us as we try to chase the rabbit around the house .
What a drug cliché .
It helps that the rabbit is white .
Mr. I returns to reading the rhyme of the ancient mariner out loud .
He remarks that he is feeling sinister .
Red glow returns .
T+03:00
The time dilation is extreme .
In 15 minutes , an entire evening has been had .
I say that I would love to feel the crunch of some moist bell peppers in my mouth .
Im not enticed by the idea of food , just the sensation of that moist pepper snap as one crunches down on a freshly sliced stick of pepper .
Mr. I takes out a cleaver to slice the peppers , but discovers there is none .
I comment on the cleaver .
He cackles .
He becomes Ahab .
I back away .
We realize that this is reminiscent of the rabbits defensive posture , posed against Mr. I .
We laugh as we begin to eat our celery sticks .
We are rabbits .
T+4:00 Mr. I proposes that I join he and his colleagues on the board of directors .
He has a newly formed not for profit corporation .
I am completely zoned and this seems too surreal .
We are somehow in a corporate boardroom and he is showing me his companys mission statement , and its articles of incorporation .
I am delighted by the invitation and my companion lays out the details .
He will handle all the legal matters .
I will travel and collect data .
Others will have their positions .
The hour of Gonzo has begun .
Mr. I has put a CD full of strange dissonant noises on the stereo .
He is now wearing a George W Bush mask and parading around the house in a sheet .
The music is vaguely tribal , but the occasional crash of timpani is disruptive to that idea .
I feel compelled to place my hand on the back of my neck .
Mmm , comforting .
Mr. I insists on talking about some of his sexual conquests .
He would like to fuck a redhead before his time is up .
T+05:00 Ms. M is now sober and would like to go home .
I am in no shape to drive .
Ms. I has at this point decided to sleep .
The three of us accompany Ms. M to her car and we watch her as she leaves .
It is extremely cold and the adrenergic stimulation makes shivering more pronounced .
Mr. I and I walk back and pass a few Saturday evening drunks along the way .
One is peeing on his own shoes .
He looks like a cartoon .
I laugh to myself and Mr. I laughs .
Life is amusing .
We get back to the safety of his home and begin the philosophical discussion .
Social , political , scientific notions are flung around amidst the now flickering colors of the bulbs .
Why are they flickering ?
Mr. I removes the green bulb from the kitchen .
The kitchen is now filled with a strawberry red intensity .
I remark that we need the balance of the kiwi , the strawberry will overpower us without it .
The light is reinstalled .
This point is more serious than comic .
T+06:00
We descend into more discussion of scientific matters and matters relating to the corporate mission .
The intensity of the hallucinations are fading but this is only apparent in a room with normal lighting .
I have been drinking water all night , and pissing all night .
We both note how wonderful the experience has been , and how clear and clean our cognitive abilities have been .
This is not debilitating like other significant hallucinogens .
T+07:00
We realize that the time dilation is gone .
My trip is more or less over and I am very capable of driving .
I do not feel drained , mentally or physically .
I drive home uneventfully .
I got to sleep at about 5:30 AM and woke up at 12:30 PM .
No hangover , no mental dullness , no physical pain or soreness .
Nothing .
A positive energy was noted .
I am speechless .
This is profound , social , comically entertaining and without a significant refractory ( hangover ) period .
I feel very hopeful about this material .
Be safe .
Learn your limits slowly .
Enjoy your lilfe .

It is a separate entity from Apogee Software LLC , developers of the still alive Duke Nukem Trilogy . )
According to the complaint , " Apogee repeatedly assured Take - Two and the video - gaming community that it was diligently working toward competing development of the PC Version of the Duke Nukem Forever . "
Those assurances have yet to result in a working , shippable product .
Instead , 3D Realms was shut down and many former Duke Nukem Forever staffers are looking for work .

After repeated promises that " industry joke " Duke Nukem Forever was finally " on the right track " and rumored to have been released year in and year out , Take - Two went far enough to offer cash incentives to 3D Realms to have the game finished at various points .
Looks like the developer is completely out of cash now .
And may owe more than it expected .

Take - Two Sues Apogee Over ‘ Duke Nukem ' Game Sequel [ Bloomberg ]
Today on The Huffngton Post , actor Jim Carrey posted his thoughts about autism and vaccines .
With his very first paragraph it became apparent how little Carrey understood the issues involved :
Recently , I was amazed to hear a commentary by CNN ’s Campbell Brown on the controversial vaccine issue .
After a ruling by the ‘ special vaccine court ’ saying the Measles , Mumps , Rubella shot was n’t found to be responsible for the plaintiffs ’ autism , she and others in the media began making assertions that the judgment was in , and vaccines had been proven safe .
No one would be more relieved than Jenny and I if that were true .
But with all due respect to Ms. Brown , a ruling against causation in three cases out of more than 5000 hardly proves that other children wo n’t be adversely affected by the MMR …
Point one Mr Carrey .
The vaccine issue is only controversial to adherents of your belief system .
Within scientific , medical , legal , autistic and parental circles its not even slightly controversial .
Point two , the three cases chosen were chosen – by the plaintiffs legal team – to represent their absolute best chance of winning .
If they had won , there was an excellent chance all the cases that were suggesting MMR as causation would have just ‘ won ’ automatically .
Thats why its called an Omnibus .
Point three , regarding the MMR , it has been firmly established that :
a) The data supporting the MMR hypothesis was fixed .
b ) The science supporting the MMR theory was badly wrong – both badly done and exposed to contaminants .
You might also note that the court was not attempting to see if the children were ‘ adversely affected by the MMR ’ , it was looking to see – using the three cases the legal team representing the families thought were the absolute best – if MMR caused autism .
It did n’t .
Thats probably why your Campbell Brown found it easy to say the MMR hypothesis was dead and buried .
You go to say Mr Carrey that :
Not everyone gets cancer from smoking , but cigarettes do cause cancer .
After 100 years and many rulings in favor of the tobacco companies , we finally figured that out .
Yes , we did – and do you know how ?
With _good science_ – just like the science that established in the three MMR test cases that the MMR did n’t cause autism .
And its fascinating that you bring up this parallel to the smoking issue and then later in your blog post invoke the name of Bernadine Healy .
Healy – who ’s ‘ more sensible voice ’ you say you ’d rather listen to .
Did you know Healy used to be a member of TASSC :
TASSC was created in 1993 by the APCO Worldwide public relations firm , and was funded by tobacco company Philip Morris ( now Altria ) … .
According to Sheldon Rampton and John Stauber in their article How Big Tobacco Helped Create “ the Junkman ” , one of the forerunners of TASSC at Philip Morris was a 1988 “ Proposal for the Whitecoat Project , ” named after the white laboratory coats that scientists sometimes wear .
The project had four goals : “ Resist and roll back smoking restrictions .
Restore smoker confidence .
Reverse scientific and popular misconception that ETS ( passive smoking ) is harmful .
Restore social acceptability of smoking . ”
[ own inserts ]
Is that what you consider a sensible voice Mr Carrey ?
Someone who supported the tobacco agenda ?
Moving on , you say :
If we are to believe that the ruling of the ‘ vaccine court ’ in these cases mean that all vaccines are safe , then we must also consider the rulings of that same court in the Hannah Polling and Bailey Banks cases , which ruled vaccines were the cause of autism and therefore assume that all vaccines are unsafe .
Clearly both are irresponsible assumptions , and neither option is prudent .
First and foremost , the vaccine court did not rule at all in the Hannah Poling case .
HHS conceded .
And what they conceded was that Hannah Poling was damaged by vaccines resulting in ‘ autism like features ’ .
In fact , when we look at the the one piece of medical science carried out on Hannah Poling ( co- authored by her own father ) , we see that only three of the symptoms described as being the result of vaccine injury appear on the DSM ( IV ) diagnostic criteria for autism .
As for Bailey Banks , this is a perfect illustration of both how the vaccine court in the USA was designed to work and also how terrible the evidence was in the three MMR test cases .
The Banks ruling ( subtitled ‘ Non-autistic developmental delay ’ by the way ) drew a line of causation from vaccine to PDD - NOS .
It is able to do this as the burden of proof for any science presented to the vaccine court is ‘ 50 % plus a feather ’ .
In other words , it just has to be plausible , no causation needs to be shown .
What does n’t seem in doubt is that Bailey was injured by a vaccine which resulted in a condition called ADEM .
The judge in the case then went on to accept the plaintiffs position that the ADEM in turn caused PDD - NOS .
He did this seemingly because there was no evidence to the contrary – e.g. no evidence that ADEM * does n ’t* cause PDD - NOS .
In any scientific situation – including civil court in the US – this would never have been accepted .
The plaintiff would have had to have demonstrated that ADEM * did * cause PDD - NOS .
And a search of PubMed reveals nothing for ‘ ADEM autism ’ or ‘ ADEM PDD ’.
So , in the Banks case , because there was no evidence that ADEM does not cause PDD - NOS , they won .
In every situation bar the vaccine court , the Banks ’ would not have won their case .
There is no science to support the idea ADEM causes autism .
Bearing this ‘ 50 % plus a feather ’ concept in mind it is clear just how utterly dreadful the evidence was to support the idea MMR caused autism .
Not only could plaintiffs not provide any evidence that MMR causes autism , respondents produced reams of evidence to show it clearly does n’t .
You carry on Mr Carrey to say :
I ’ve also heard it said that no evidence of a link between vaccines and autism has ever been found .
That statement is only true for the CDC , the AAP and the vaccine makers who ’ve been ignoring mountains of scientific information and testimony .
There ’s no evidence of the Lincoln Memorial if you look the other way and refuse to turn around .
But if you care to look , it ’s really quite impressive .
For a sample of vaccine injury evidence go to http://www.generationrescue.org/lincolnmemorial.html.
Your analogy is ridiculous .
I could go to any library and find evidence for the Lincoln Memorial without ever seeing it .
In fact , what your analogy does is demonstrate exactly how blinkered and able to only face one direction at one time you and your colleagues are .
The evidence you present as that being supportive of evidence between a link between vaccines and autism is equally ridiculous and blinkered .
I simply do n;t have the time to tackle the mountain of misinformation presented on the page you link to suffice to say there ’s not a single section that does n’t have a major error .
Most of them have been tackled on this and other blogs over the years .
Next you say :
In all likelihood the truth about vaccines is that they are both good and bad .
While ingredients like aluminum , mercury , ether , formaldehyde and anti-freeze may help preserve and enhance vaccines , they can be toxic as well .
The assortment of viruses delivered by multiple immunizations may also be a hazard .
I agree with the growing number of voices within the medical and scientific community who believe that vaccines , like every other drug , have risks as well as benefits and that for the sake of profit , American children are being given too many , too soon .
One thing is certain .
We do n’t know enough to announce that all vaccines are safe !
Mr Carrey , * vaccines do not contain anti-freeze * – for goodness sake , even Jay Gordon , Evan ’s Paediatrician knows that !
Did you also know that ( to quote myself ) :
There ’s also Aluminium in breast milk so lets compare the two .
According to this paper ( which is from 1990 – any more up to date papers welcomed ) the amount of Aluminium in breast milk is 49 ?
g/L.
The average amount of breast milk expressed per day is 0.85 liters .
This means that 41.65?g
Aluminium per day is in breast milk .
Now , according to this paper , there is between 125 – 850?g of Aluminium per dose in a vaccine .
So , for a 6 year old , total Aluminium is between 2,125 – 14,450 ?g .
In real terms this means that after between 51 and 346 days breast feeding , a 6 year old will have taken onboard the same amount of Aluminium as from the total US vaccine schedule .
Now I could n’t find out what vaccines contained the lower amount or which contained the higher amount .
Even so , this means that if every vaccine a 6 year old has that contains Aluminium contains the highest possible amount , within a year of breast feeding they will have matched that .
Or to put it another way , an anti-vax tree - hugger soccer mom who does n’t vaccinate her baby will have given him the same amount of Aluminium he would ’ve had in six years after one year of breast feeding .
And thats of course , not even touched on the fact that :
In the Earth ’s crust , aluminium is the most abundant ( 8.13 % ) metallic element , and the third most abundant of all elements ( after oxygen and silicon )
And is found naturally occurring in sea water , fresh water , the human body etc etc. [ Regarding Formaldehyde ]
… There ’s also Formaldehyde in Apples , Apricots , Banana ’s and ….ah , I lost interest .
Lots of stuff .
Including the human body .
So – how much is in vaccines ?
According to this and using it in combination with the US vaccine schedule referenced above , we can see that the total amount of Formaldehyde in vaccines from the vaccine schedule for a 6 year old child is 1.2016 mg ( again , do your own maths , correct me if I ’m wrong ) .
For comparison to that 1.2mg in all vaccines for a 6 year old , 1 ( one ) banana contains 16.3 mg Formaldehyde .
Mr Carrey , you ’ve got to stop throwing these scaremongering nonfacts around .
Its damned irresponsible for a start .
Lastly Mr Carrey , you say :
If the CDC , the AAP and Ms. Brown insist that our children take twice as many shots as the rest of the western world , we need more independent vaccine research not done by the drug companies selling the vaccines or by organizations under their influence .
Studies that cannot be internally suppressed .
In terms of autism , if you want to make a big deal out of the fact that ‘ our children take twice as many shots as the rest of the western world ’ then please consider this – the UK has less shots than you .
We also have a higher prevalence than you .
1 in 100 vs 1 in 150 .
And please also do n’t invoke silly conspiracy theories .
Think about how science works .
A study is done , funded by Eli Lily for example .
It is peer reviewed and found to be good quality and it is published in , lets say NEJM .
Now , * every single reader of that study * can see exactly what methods and means were used to reach the studies conclusions .
I ask you Mr Carrey , how much more independent can you get ?
How much more transparent ?
Basically anyone , anywhere can try and replicate that same studies results .
If they can and a few others can – the results are good .
If nobody can ( think Andrew Wakefield ) then the results must be bad .
And for goodness sake man , grow up , who is ‘ suppressing ’ what study exactly ?
Have you _any_ evidence at all that any study ever has been internally suppressed ?
Or are you just throwing this stuff out to scare people ?
Mr Carrey , I loved the Truman Show but this is n’t it .
There ’s no god like figure overseeing every aspect of your life and wanting to control it .
I ask you – get in contact with an actual scientist and go through your concerns with them .
At the very least they ’ll be able to stop you saying silly things like there ’s anti-freeze in vaccines .
Defense lawyers also say the arguments ignore the proven power of DNA to refute almost every other type of evidence .
In a case before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court , for example , Lynne Abraham , the Philadelphia district attorney , argued that the defendant , Anthony Wright , was not entitled to DNA testing because of the overwhelming evidence presented at trial , including his confession , four witnesses and clothing stained with the victims ’ blood that the police said was found at Mr. Wright ’s home .
The Pennsylvania DNA statute requires the courts to determine if there is a “ reasonable possibility ” that the test would prove innocence .
Prosecutors say they are concerned that convicts will seek DNA testing as a delay tactic or a fishing expedition , and that allowing DNA tests undermines hard - won jury verdicts and opens the floodgates to overwhelming requests .
“ It ’s definitely a matter of drawing the line somewhere , ” said Peter Carr , the assistant district attorney who handled the case of Mr. Wright , who was accused of raping and killing a 77 - year - old woman .
The defendant did not request testing until 2005 , three years after the statute was passed , Mr. Carr said , and in his view there was no possibility that the test would show innocence .
“ There ’s also the idea that you want finality for the victim ’s sake , ” Mr. Carr said .
“ If someone else ’s semen was found at the crime scene , we ’d have to talk to the victim ’s family about whether the victim was sexually active . ”
Barry Scheck , a co-founder of the Innocence Project , a New York legal advocacy group that uses DNA to help the wrongfully convicted , said that most prosecutors no longer resisted testing in cases like Mr. Wright ’s , where there is one perpetrator .
More obstacles arise , Mr. Scheck said , in cases with multiple defendants or cases where a test result might point to another suspect , even if it does not clearly prove the innocence of the defendant .
In one such case near Austin , Tex. , a defendant who was convicted in the bludgeoning death of his wife requested a DNA test on a bloody bandanna found 100 feet from the house .
On its own , a test of the bandanna would not prove the guilt or innocence of the defendant the same way testing semen in a rape case might .
But if it matched DNA found at the scene of a similar crime in the same county , or DNA in a database of convicted felons , it would be significant evidence that someone else might be responsible  the kind of evidence that might plant a reasonable doubt in a juror ’s mind or lead to a confession by a perpetrator .

Capitulating to critics on the Republican National Committee , embattled Republican Party Chairman Michael S. Steele has signed a secret pact agreeing to controls and restraints on how he spends hundreds of millions of dollars in party funds and contracts , The Washington Times has learned .
The “ good governance ” agreement revives checks and balances Mr. Steele resisted implementing for RNC contracts , fees for legal work and other expenditures that were not renewed after the 2008 presidential nominating contest .
The agreement , proposed by several current and former RNC officials , goes further , making 33 - year RNC veteran Jay Banning , who was fired by Mr. Steele along with his deputy last month , an on - call adviser to the RNC treasurer .
Mr. Banning was seen as a trusted liaison to RNC members critical of Mr. Steele ’s tenure and financial management .
“ I regard them - the Steele administration - bound by it , ” former Republican National Committee General Counsel David Norcross told The Times on Tuesday .
Mr. Norcross , RNC Treasurer Randy Pullen , chairman of the Arizona Republican Party , and former party budget chiefs Ron Kaufman and Alec Poitevint had fought with Mr. Steele over having the 168 - member committee vote on restoring the “ good governance ” guidelines created in 2004 at a special May 20 meeting .
Trevor Francis , the RNC ’s new communications director , would not comment on the agreement that several of the dissident members said was reached .
“ Everything was already in place , ” Mr. Francis said .
Under nearly constant fire from conservatives since his Jan. 30 election , Mr. Steele last Wednesday accused the resolution ’s proponents of a power grab “ scheme . ”
It looked like an impasse , with a showdown - and a possible no -confidence vote in Mr. Steele - coming at a special meeting called for May 20 .
But closed - door negotiations between Mr. Steele and his representatives and Mr. Pullen and the dissident group reached an accord .
It represents the first time in memory that rebel members of the Republican Party ’s national governing body have successfully taken on the party ’s historically powerful national chairman and his loyalists .
“ We have a written agreement with them to accept and operate under terms of ‘ 04 Resolution ; make Banning available to Pullen ; keep [ former RNC chief counsel Thomas J. ]
Josefiak on retainer and available to Pullen ; keep Banning ’s assistant on the payroll and available to Pullen ; and to negotiate on [ competitive contract ] bidding and [ chief financial officer ] language , ” Mr. Norcross wrote in an e-mail to another RNC member .
“ We think we have the tools to hold them to it .
They believe we have or could readily muster the votes to adopt something at the summer meeting , ” Mr. Norcross wrote .
The written agreement remains in effect until the scheduled July summer meeting of the full RNC , at which time the entire body is expected to vote on the resolution .
The funding fight intensified the open challenge to Mr. Steele ’s authority .
Unhappy RNC conservatives secured the signatures needed to force the committee to convene next month ’s special meeting to vote on a resolution labeling Democrats as “ socialists , ” despite the chairman ’s reservations about the political wisdom of the move .
Critics said the “ socialist ” resolution battle was a sign of Mr. Steele ’s rocky start as RNC chairman and his continuing struggle to assert control of the party ’s message since his election in January .

I mean , a man ’s ( and for all the implicit sexism , it is the man who pays for the engagement ring , after all ) gotta eat and pay his rent , after all , and does n’t this whole Wedding Industrial Complex just put unnecessary financial blocks on the road to actually building a life together ?
In any case , as good artists do , Lee Gainer is questioning this tradition in creative ways .
Design Boom reports :
american artist lee gainer is based in washington , DC and creates images that question culturally accepted perceptions .
her series ‘ two months salary ’ is focused on the engagement ring industry .
through the series , gainer investigates the evolution of the engagement ring from luxury item to must - have item .
she discovered the popular convention of spending two - months salary on a ring was originally invented by debeers in 1947 .
this purchasing habit continues today and became an interest of gainer ’s. gainer calculated the average US salaries for a number of occupations and found a selection of ring ’s based on the two - month rule .
she assembled these into a series of twenty prints each featuring nine rings and the occupation name .
Some examples of Gainer ’s work :
I wonder what my salary would buy …

Fantasy Proleague Round 5 Preview
You choose 6 players & 1 team that score points when they play well .
You pick 3 players that lose you points when they play well .
Players & teams can be traded between weeks for those valued less than them .
First , congratulationsfor winning Round 4 with a final score of 183 , 10 above the 2nd place SKT team ( HotBid made teams for all the pro teams ) .
Check out the Round 4 thread for any information on that .
There are n't many changes this round , the only one really being a minor reduction in team scoring ( as we saw last round they dominated the scoring , partly as a result of their scoring boost and partly a result of all the 3 - 0 matches we saw ) ; this should bring team scoring more in line with players .

Team Selection
Just like last round you will be forming aconsisting of 6 players ( 1 designated captain , used for tie breakers ) and 1 Proleague team costing a maximum of 30 points who will contributed points to your team based on their performance .
New to this round however is the addition of a , this consists of 3 players costing aof 13 points ; yourplayers will be subtracting their point total from your total score ( time to start looking for those overpriced players heading in to a slump ) .
Note that theandselections are not related to each other , you may not however have a player on both yourand ( you 're not stupid right ? ) .
Yourmust still follow the rule of having one of each race ; however theis not limited by this restriction so you can pick 3 Protoss players if you so wish .

P / ( 4.56 / 11 ) ) / M * M/11 + C * ( 11 - M )/11
P = Player 's points .
M = number of matches played .
C = Player 's original cost
4.56 is the number of points a 1 point cost player is expected to score over the entire round
11 is the total number of matches each team plays in a round .
( 4.56 / 11 ~= .41 )
Basically , this is figuring out what a player 's point cost would be given their current performance ( ie someone scoring 4.56 points in one game would have a cost of 11 ) this is then weighted with their original cost ; the weights are percentage of games played for the " new " cost and percentage of games left for the original cost .
I hope this makes sense , if not feel free to ask questions .
As an example let 's say ( 9 cost ) plays in two matches the first week going 1 - 0 with a Team win in the first match and 2 - 0 in the second with an ace win and team win ( 4 pts 1st game , 9 pts 2nd game [ 3 wins * 2 , 2 lineups * 1 , 1 ace * 2 , 2 team wins * 1 , 1 Three Win Streak * 1 ] ) = 13 pts for week 1 with two matches played out of 11 for the round :
T = ( 13 / .41 ) / 2 * 2/11 + 9 * ( 11-2/11 )
T = 31.4 / 2 * 2/11 + 9 * 9/11 = ?
T = 15.7 * 2/11 + 9 * 9/11 = ( At this point we can see he has an estimated cost of 15.7 if he continues on this scoring trend whereas his original cost is 9 -- these are then weighted based on games played and games left )
T = 2.85 + 7.4
Trade Value = 10.21 ( 's trade value at the end of week one with him scoring 13 pts over 2 games )
Trade Value is directly comparable with a players original cost thus someone with a Trade Value of 9 is rated the same as a player that started at Cost 9 .
Adjusted Trade Value is what is used in the actual trade calculations and is simply Trade Value * Number of Games Left .
Thus , at 10.21 with 9 games left would have an Adjusted Trade Value of 91.89 ; say plays one game in week 1 and his new trade value is 9.5 ( just picked this randomly fyi ) , with 10 games left would have an Adjusted Trade Value of 95 .
Notice how 's Adjusted Trade Value is higher than 's because he has the extra game left to score additional points in .
Trade Value = (/ ( 4.56 / 11 ) ) //11 +* ( 11 -) /11P = Player 's points .
M = number of matches played .
C = Player 's original cost4.56 is the number of points a 1 point cost player is expected to score over the entire round11 is the total number of matches each team plays in a round .

I hope this makes sense , if not feel free to ask questions .
As an example let 's say Leta ( 9 cost ) plays in two matches the first week going 1 - 0 with a Team win in the first match and 2 - 0 in the second with an ace win and team win ( 4 pts 1st game , 9 pts 2nd game [ 3 wins * 2 , 2 lineups * 1 , 1 ace * 2 , 2 team wins * 1 , 1 Three Win Streak * 1 ] ) = 13 pts for week 1 with two matches played out of 11 for the round : T = ( 13 / .41 ) / 2 * 2/11 + 9 * ( 11-2/11 ) T = 31.4 / 2 * 2/11 + 9 * 9/11 = ?T = 15.7 * 2/11 + 9 * 9/11 = ( At this point we can see he has an estimated cost of 15.7 if he continues on this scoring trend whereas his original cost is 9 -- these are then weighted based on games played and games left ) T = 2.85 + 7.4 Trade Value = 10.21 ( Leta 's trade value at the end of week one with him scoring 13 pts over 2 games ) Trade Value is directly comparable with a players original cost thus someone with a Trade Value of 9 is rated the same as a player that started at Cost 9 .
Adjusted Trade Value is what is used in the actual trade calculations and is simply Trade Value * Number of Games Left .
Thus , Leta at 10.21 with 9 games left would have an Adjusted Trade Value of 91.89 ; say free plays one game in week 1 and his new trade value is 9.5 ( just picked this randomly fyi ) , free with 10 games left would have an Adjusted Trade Value of 95 .
Notice how free 's Adjusted Trade Value is higher than Leta 's because he has the extra game left to score additional points in .
Again , just like last round , you will have an oppurtunity each week to trade players from both yourandteams .
Unlike last season however , instead of Semioldguy generating a list of possible trades , each player will have athat will fluctuate based on their performance over the course of the round and will start at their cost .
Between weeks you can trade any player on yourfor someone with a lower ( or equal ) trading is the same except you must trade for someone ofvalue .
Trades are made using anwhich takes into account how many games each player has left .
You will be limited to a maximum of 2trades and 1 trade per week and you can not trade away your captain from your ; also , yourmust still contain one player of each race .
There is also ( like last round ) the - 1 points per player trade made .
Groups
This round you will also be able to join groups to be able to compare your results with a smaller subset of the players , for example there might be a staff group , a first time fpl player 's group ; anything you want to group by .

Of all the hard choices Defense Secretary Robert Gates had to make in his radical overhaul of the Pentagon 's arsenal , the toughest , he tells Danger Room , was the decision to gut Future Combat Systems , the Army 's $ 200 billion effort to design a fleet of next - generation tanks and troop carriers .
For nearly a decade , the Army has worked on a set of lightly armored , deeply networked combat vehicles to speed U.S. soldiers into battle .
It 's the service 's signature effort to upgrade its forces for the wars of tomorrow .
But ultimately , Gates says , the Army made the wrong call about how it could wage war in the future .
So he eliminated all the vehicles in the Future Combat Systems , or FCS , project .
" Most difficult of all of these for me was the FCS program , " Gates says in a Pentagon conference call ( .wma ) .
" I actually did n't make up my mind once and for all on it until this weekend . "
Today , the Army uses 6 - ton Humvees , designed to bring a few soldiers through uneven terrain ; 18 - ton Stryker troop carriers , to haul infantrymen around an urban battlefield ; and 72 - ton tanks , optimized for destroying another big army .
Under Future Combat Systems , all of these would 've been replaced with one family of vehicles , each 27 tons big .
" Trying to build that range of capabilities into a single vehicle —
really we had n't gotten there yet .
And the question is whether you even can do that , " Gates says .
The vehicles originally featured a flat bottom that made them perfect targets for roadside bombs , added Vice Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. James Cartwright .
" They were adding on armor that was starting to weigh it down and make it questionable whether the axles , the transmissions , all of those things , would be able to function for extended periods of time during a heavy configuration .
All of these started to bring into question whether one class of vehicle could in fact cover the range of operations that we envision are going to be the reality of the future . "
The Army theorized that if it picked a midpoint between the heavy tank and the light Humvee , between all - out conventional wars and insurgencies , its all - in - one vehicle would work in any situation .
Not so ,
Cartwright says .
Other big forces would tear through that relatively light armor , and so would the metal - shredding bombs wielded by today 's militants .
Those explosives " are very lethal , and they 're very able to be employed by non-nation states in counterinsurgencies .
And just bringing that fat reality into the equation makes it very difficult to come with a single class of vehicle . "
Gates says he still believes it's " critical " for the Army to get a new ground fleet to replace its trucks and tanks and cannon .
But it 's going to take time — " 15 years or more to implement , " he says .
The military establishment needs to come to " broad agreement on what that program ought to look like , and then build it out .
Start bending steel just as soon as we can . "
UPDATE : Gates says he understood that many of his decisions " did not leave smiles on the face of different services , clearly . "
But now it 's time for the admirals and the generals to fall in line , he says : " I do n’t want to see any guerrilla warfare on this ....
We have a chain of command . "

Listen to the whole conference call here .

There are few things in this world that cannot be easily replaced , repaired , or regained .
Our health and the health of the ones we love falls into this category .
The best thing we can do to protect our health , above medication or rest , is prevention .
This week , news broke of a new and fatal swine flu on the Mexico - U.S. border .
It has quickly turned into a growing outbreak and possible pandemic .
Knowing about these important and growing cases is vital to public health .
Fortunately , there are several useful online resources that track health information and disease outbreaks .
This resource guide will help you better track not only cases of Swine Flu , but other public health concerns as well .
Step 1 . Check the WHO Disease Outbreak News Center
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) is the leading source for health and disease - related information .
If you 're just looking for breaking news on major epidemics and outbreaks , visit their Disease Outbreak News Center , which provides current and historical information on diseases , as well as an RSS feed .
Step 2 . Set up Google News Alerts
One of the best ways to keep up - to - date on recent changes or breaking news is to use Google News and Google Alerts to have breaking news emailed to you or sent to your RSS reader .
Set up a Google News
Alert with the keywords " swine flu " to be sure you catch any major mention of the issue .
Step 3 . Check the CDC Travel Notices for Outbreak Alerts
If you 're looking to travel , check the CDC's Travel Notices .
The Center for Disease Control provides information on major outbreaks across the world and is the U.S. body that determines whether or not an area is safe for U.S. citizens to travel to .
The CDC has several levels of notices , from minor cases to epidemics .
Always check the CDC 's notices before traveling - especially to areas that may be affected by the swine flu .
The information is also available as an RSS feed .
Step 4 . Find Where the Flu has Spread with HealthMap
While the WHO provides up - to - date information on outbreaks , HealthMap takes it several steps further .
HealthMap aggregates news feeds from the WHO , Google News , ProMED , and elsewhere to map out all of the disease outbreaks .
It includes a heat index to understand how bad certain situations really are and the most recent health - related news items .
Tip :
To check just for influenza - related news , check only the box that says " influenza " under " Diseases , last 30 days " .
Stay Calm , Stay Informed
While there 's likely to be much concern on social networking sites about public health incidents , it 's important to keep things in proportion , and go direct to the sources of news rather than spreading panic .

If you are a Major League Baseball fan , you might have heard of " Tokyo Dome " .
It is the first indoor baseball stadium in Japan , the home of the Yomiuri Giants .
It is not just for baseball games , as it is often used for various indoor events , such as American Football , Snowboard X - Games as well as music concerts .
Just recently , this stadium hosted the season opener for the Boston Red Sox and The Oakland Athletics .
The nearest station is the JR Suidobashi station or the Tokyo Metro Korakuen station .
It is in a very convenient location , very near the JR Tokyo Station .
This week 's restaurant , " I - Kousya " is just a few minutes walk from the JR Suidobashi station .
It is not a restaurant to seat large number of people ; I - Kousya only seat about 15 people at the maximum .
But once you step into the world of I - Kousya , you will get a feeling that you are about to get something very good .
The hamburgers come in three different sizes , so that it will satisfy every appetite .
One thing I - Kousya stands out is that they offer very unique hamburgers , which are rarely seen in other hamburger restaurants .
The one burger that will stimulate your taste buds is the Blue Cheese Burger .
It is not just a hamburger that uses blue cheese instead of the ordinary cheddar cheese .
As an added bonus , it also comes with a crisp fried onion topped on the patty with blue cheese .
The first joy of eating this hamburger comes when you are preparing to eat this hamburger .
Since the hamburger comes in open - style , you will have to put the vegetable side of the burger on top of the patty .
Then you will realize that the hamburger ’s height is too high for eating .
That 's when you will have to squeeze the hamburger to fit your mouth .
When you squeeze , you will hear the crisp onions breaking into pieces , and that sound will definitely stimulate your appetite .
Dig in , and you will be surprised with the unique collaboration between the rich flavor of the blue cheese and the fried onion .
Another interesting hamburger is the G.M Mushroom burger .
G.M. stands for " Grilled , Marinated " .
It is a hamburger with grilled mushrooms with Swiss cheese .
Although it does n't have the instantly - stimulating taste like the Blue Cheese Burger , but the richness of the juicy mushrooms with the Swiss cheese and the perfectly - cooked beef patty makes this hamburger something special .
Since I - Kousya offers both fried onion and barbeque - sauce topping , I tried something special with my hamburger .
When I was still growing up , my favorite hamburger place was Carl 's Jr. ( yes , I know , it is a chain restaurant ) .
My favorite hamburger was the Western Bacon Cheeseburger , which comes with cheese , BBQ sauce , bacon and onion rings .
Since there are no Carl 's Jr. restaurants in Japan , I ordered the hamburger with the same topping , to imitate the Western Bacon Cheeseburger .
Of course , this is a restaurant hamburger , and it costs a lot more than the Western Bacon Cheeseburger , but I will have to admit that this hamburger is a lot better than the one that is served at Carl 's Jr.
So next time you are going to a baseball game , you might want to arrive at Suidobashi station early , grab I - Kousya 's hamburger , and enjoy the game while eating a very delicious hamburger .
But be careful , since the hamburgers are carefully cooked , it might take some time during the peak hours .
The salsa burger .
The Swiss Cheeseburger .

The International Criminal Court is accepting supporting evidence of children 's drawings of the alleged crimes committed in Darfur .
This sketch by Abdul Maggit depicts a typical scene of destruction .
Rights group Waging Peace collected the drawings from refugees in Chad .
Abduljabbar 's picture shows someone being thrown into a fire and a soldier who appears to be cutting off a mans head .
Mohammed 's drawing shows Janjaweed militia in two pick - up trucks using machine guns on civilians .
He also shows a tank .
The Sudanese government has always denied using heavy artillery in Darfur .
This picture by Mohamat shows another village attack .
Next to each civilian who has been shot is the word " Morts " , which means dead people in French .
Adam , 15 , shows shot civilians ' bodies being tossed into the river .
On the back of the drawing , he wrote : " Look at these pictures carefully , and you will see what happened in Darfur .
Thank you . "
Ismael , also 15 , drew a Sudanese helicopter bombing his village , torching houses and killing civilians and a donkey .
He said the armed men on horseback were Janjaweed .
Bakhid was eight years old when he saw his village being attacked and burned by Janjaweed forces on horse back and Sudanese forces in vehicles and tanks .
One young artist named Aisha said : " It is very kind to send us food , but this is Africa and we are used to being hungry .
What I ask is that you please take the guns away from the people who are killing us . "

FDIC Chairwoman Sheila Bair announced last week that the quasi-public insurance monopoly would become insolvent in the next few months if it is not allowed to implement a one - time , draconian surcharge on all U.S. banks .
This charge will , in some cases , wipe out last year ’s profits .
At the same time , the FDIC has requested an additional $ 500 billion " loan " to from Congress .
Small , solvent , well - run local and regional banks have objected .
They rightly claim that they are not the problem .
These banks have a solid and growing deposit base and many of them service their own loans and so did not get caught in the trap of originating bad loans and dumping them on the secondary mortgage market in federally - guaranteed bundles .
Whether they know it or not , these banks intuit that , like Social Security , there is no FDIC " fund . "
FDIC insurance , like social security , is just another government - coerced Ponzi scheme — a tax that , according to former FDIC commissioner Bill Isaac , goes immediately to the Treasury to buy “ spending . . . on missiles , school lunches , water projects , and the like . ”
Rather than increasing their taxes and punishing their relatively good behavior , these small banks suggest that the FDIC look first to Bailout Banks , the Wall Street mega - banks that have received nearly a trillion dollars in unearned , government - supplied capital via the printing press , for any increased insurance premium / tax .
Ms. Bair rejected these pleas by claiming that FDIC law does not allow her to " discriminate " against banks based on their size .
Clever .
What is really going is that the Bailout Banks are using the government and its insurance monopoly to help them gain market share by drastically increasing the operating costs of their smaller , better - run and scrappy competitors .
You see , in the fall of 2008 as the Wachovias and Washington Mutuals of the banking world were going down and being served , on a federal silver platter , to the Bailout Banks , the free market — individual depositors — were silently and electronically withdrawing their deposits from poorly run and insolvent banks and depositing those funds with smaller , well - run banks .
There are many local and regional banks that are flush with a solid deposit base and are willing to continue making loans as they always have , based on the five C’s of credit .
Furthermore , since that fateful fortnight in October of 2008 when Congress passed and implemented the financial bailout bill and the feds began stuffing the pockets of all their Wall Street friends with newly printed dollars so that they would have money to cover two decades of bad bets , the capital markets have taken notice .
The Bailout Banks have lost between 65 and 95 percent of their value since October of 2008 .
Knowing that the Bailout Banks have elected to spend the night with the Devil , the market knows that their reputation will be gone in the morning .
For this reason , smart investors are taking their capital and running away from the Bailout Banks .
The Federales of course will not allow this .
They created our present fractional - reserve banking system and have the regulatory power to keep everyone in the system in their proper caste .
This is why many of the Bailout Banks have not been as eager to lend as their smaller competitors .
They are keeping their newly printed powder dry for the squeeze play — they intend to use their potentially limitless bailout funds to acquire the small banks that cannot handle the surcharge or new FDIC insurance " premiums . "
The FDIC claims to have $ 20 billion in its insurance fund to cover failed banks and already has a $ 100 billion line of credit with the Treasury .
Yet it requests a loan of over 25 times the amount in its fund to cover banks that will become insolvent over the next few years .
If the FDIC can simply borrow to cover this exposure , why impose a surcharge or increase premiums at all ?
The answer — consolidation .
This is just the start of the pressure on the smaller banks , as the banking system becomes more and more nationalized , expect to see " section 8 " - like lending requirements imposed on all banks , not just the Bailout Banks .
With ACORN receiving potentially billions in the latest Obama stimulus package , a federal mandate requiring banks to make bad loans to unqualified borrowers is on the horizon .
Do n’t be fooled .
The real purpose of this do - gooder cover is to bury small banks and allow Bailout Banks to seize market share .
Two things could stop or delay this from occurring .
First , depositors could do their homework and choose to avoid the Bailout Banks and deposit their funds with smaller banks that have rejected bailout funds .
Second , a capitalist like Warren Buffet could step forward and offer a free market alternative to the FDIC .
Mr. Buffet for several years was in the business of providing private insurance for deposits in excess of $ 100,000 .
With the help of some aggressive and sharp lawyers and the choice of a good court venue , Buffet could break , or at least attempt to break , the FDIC ’s monopoly and offer private insurance to the well - run banks .
If Buffet was willing to privately insure a bank ’s deposits , depositors would naturally flock to these banks and away from zombie banks propped up by the FDIC and the federal printing press .
If Buffet had this kind of courage , it would bring about the speedy demise of at least two banks that have had a stranglehold on our country for a century .
Indeed , it could be the first step in reversing the socialization of the United States by putting a roadblock in front of federal attempts to centralize financial power and resources .
Come on , Warren , be a real patriot !!

In an effort to explore the boundary between thermodynamics and quantum mechanics — two fundamental yet seemingly incompatible theories of physics — a team from the UCLA Department of Physics and Astronomy has created the world 's smallest incandescent lamp .
The team , which is led by Chris Regan , a member of the California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA , and includes Yuwei Fan , Scott Singer and Ray Bergstrom , has published the results of their research May 5 in the online edition of the journal Physical Review Letters .
Thermodynamics , the crown jewel of 19th - century physics , concerns systems with many particles .
Quantum mechanics , developed in the 20th century , works best when applied to just a few .
The UCLA team is using their tiny lamp to study physicist Max Planck 's black - body radiation law , which was derived in 1900 using principles now understood to be native to both theories .
The incandescent lamp utilizes a filament made from a single carbon nanotube that is only 100 atoms wide .
To the unaided eye , the filament is completely invisible when the lamp is off , but it appears as tiny point of light when the lamp is turned on .
Even with the best optical microscope , it is only just possible to resolve the nanotube 's non-zero length .
To image the filament 's true structure the team uses an electron microscope capable of atomic resolution .
With less than 20 million atoms , the nanotube filament is both large enough to apply the statistical assumptions of thermodynamics and small enough to be considered as a molecular — that is , quantum mechanical — system .
" Because both the topic ( black - body radiation ) and the size scale ( nano ) are on the boundary between the two theories , we think this is a very promising system to explore , " Regan said .
" The carbon nanotube that is used as the lamp filament is ideal for their purposes because of its smallness and extraordinary temperature stability . "
Carbon nanotubes were only discovered in 1991 , but using carbon in a light bulb is not a new idea .
Thomas Edison 's original light bulbs used carbon filaments .
The UCLA research team 's light bulb is very similar to Edison's , except that their filament is 100,000 times narrower and 10,000 times shorter , for a total volume only one one - hundred - trillionth that of Edison's .
This research is supported by a National Science Foundation Career grant .
Probation officers have recomended that Lori Drew be given probation and a $ 5,000 fine in the nation 's first cyberbullying case , which arose from a MySpace hoax that ended with a teenage girl committing suicide .
The independent office made the recommendation in a sealed pre-sentencing report .
It came to light Sunday when Drew 's defense attorney , H. Dean Steward , filed a response .
Drew , 48 , was convicted of three misdemeanors for violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act , after a jury found she 'd violated MySpace 's terms of service when she joined with her daughter and another teen friend to create a fake profile to harass 13 - year - old Megan Meier , who then hanged herself .
The jury deadlocked on a fourth felony conspiracy charge .
Steward told the court Sunday that the defense agrees with the probation recommendation , but said the fine " is not in line with Ms. Drew 's finances .
Ms. Drew was forced , by the circumstances of this case , to close her nine year old business in November of 2007 and so has been without her former business income for the past 18 months . "
He goes on to write in his filing ( . pdf ) that , " Ms. Drew is a homemaker , supported by the income of her husband .
The Drew's [ sic ] are raising two children on Mr. Drew 's salary , which does not cover expenses each month . . . paying the recommended fine would be most difficult . "
U.S. District Judge George
Wu is scheduled to sentence Drew on May 18th , though before he does this , he still has to rule on a motion for direct acquittal that Drew 's lawyer filed after the prosecution rested its case .
Steward asked
Wu for a judgment of acquittal based on the defense ’s view that the prosecution failed to prove that Drew knew the MySpace terms of service existed , and that she knew what they said and intentionally violated them .
Wu decided to postpone ruling on the motion – perhaps to see if the jurors would acquit Drew on their own – and still has not ruled on it .
Steward still hopes that Wu will acquit his client , but in the absence of this he asked the court to impose a probation without the fine .
He also wrote that the defense would object to Meier 's family or friends speaking at the sentencing hearing , since the victim in the case was MySpace , and not Meier .
He also takes issue with a number of assertions in the pre-sentencing report , writing that Drew did n't know until after Meier 's death that she had suffered from depression prior to committing suicide .
He included a one - page transcript of a recorded call ( .pdf ) between Lori Drew and Tina Meier , Megan 's mother .
In the conversation , Meier tried to get Drew to admit that she knew about Megan 's depression , but Drew maintains she did n't know .
Steward insists that Drew did not create the fake MySpace account , nor was she involved in creating the account .
She merely glanced at the profile page on a computer screen after another teen had created it .
He writes that Drew did not " approve " the profile .
Finally , he mentions a mitigating factor that probation officers raised in their pre-sentencing report – that Drew had been widely protrayed as a pariah since the case became public .
He writes that the Drew family had a brick thrown through their window , along with numerous instances of vandalism on their property , and that neighbors harassed her viciously and non-stop with threats of serious harm until the Drews moved from the community .
UPDATE : Threat Level reached Steward and Tina Meier by phone to ask them about Steward 's request that Meier not be allowed to speak at the sentencing .
Asked if Meier was n't entitled to closure through speaking at the hearing , Steward said , " Closure is not part of the federal victims statutes .
" In a sense , they 're entitled to their closure , " he continued .
" But Tina has done it by submitting a 21 - page letter to the court .
She also had her day on the witness stand .
I have a great deal of admiration and respect for her , but enough is enough .
It was not a case about the death [ of Megan Meier ] .
MySpace was the victim under the fraud statute , and if MySpace wants to bring people into the hearing to speak , fine .
But under the law , she is not a victim . "
Meier , who submitted a lengthy and sealed letter to the judge as an addendum to the pre-sentencing report from probation officers , said she 's not surprised by Steward 's request .
" Still , I think it 's a tad ludicrous to ask for that , " she added .
" He certainly wants to keep publicity down on it , but believe me , I will be there at the hearing and unless I 'm absolutely stricken from saying a word , I will make sure my piece has been said .
It makes no difference to me whether it 's inside the court or outside .
That , I think is my right .
The victim was my daughter . "
Asked how she feels about the sentence recommended by the probation officers , Meier said that prosecutors would soon be filing their response to the pre-sentencing report and that she hopes Judge Wu " realizes the significance that people are going through this daily .
It 's not just children but adults are going through these types of situations , and it can be devastating .
Just giving somebody a small little smack on the wrist and a fine shows nothing .
" [ With regard to ] Lori Drew , I could care less what happens to that woman .
But for other people that are going through this , they need to know that the court systems are going to be behind them and back them when these kinds of things happen . "

The lead structural engineer reflects on the rise and fall of the World Trade Center towers .
The journey toward the design and construction of the World Trade Center began prior to 1960 when Minoru Yamasaki Associates was selected to design the Federal Science Pavilion , a key element of the Seattle World ’s Fair ; NBBJ was selected as the local architect .
Having accomplished many structural designs for NBBJ , it was only natural that we would obtain the commission for the structural design of the Pavilion .
That structural design , reflecting the very highest attainments of our profession , was creatively conceived and executed by John V. Christiansen ( NAE ) .
Indeed , the Pavilion stands today as an example of the importance of fine structural engineering as it influences the overall architectural process .
The entrepreneurship and skills of another of our partners , John B. Skilling ( NAE ) , were instrumental in the development of the close relationship between our firm and that of Minoru Yamasaki and Associates ; many wonderful projects were to follow .
When Yamasaki was commissioned to design the World Trade Center in New York , he proposed that we be retained as structural engineers .
Although his recommendation was influential , we were in competition with many New York firms that had more experience in high - rise design than we had .
Although we worked hard preparing for our interview with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , we would n’t have obtained the commission without the presence and the skills of John Skilling .
Once we had been awarded the commission , I moved from Seattle to New York with a team of expert engineers — Wayne A. Brewer ( drawing production and coordination ) , Paul S.A. Foster ( towers ) , Ernest T. Liu ( plaza buildings and below - grade structures ) , Jostein Ness ( detailing ) , Richard E. Taylor ( computers ) , and E. James White ( construction technology ) .
Professor Alan G. Davenport ( NAE ) , on sabbatical from the University of Western Ontario , joined us to head the wind - engineering research group .
Although I was the titular leader , the energies and talents of the entire team led to our successes .
A list of the innovations incorporated into the World Trade Center would be very long .
In the following pages , I describe just a few of the ideas and innovations conceived and developed by our team .
Most , if not all , of this technology is now a part of the standard vocabulary of structural engineers .
The tubular framing system for the perimeter walls resisted all of the lateral forces imposed by wind and earthquake , as well as the impact loads imposed on September 11 .
Although we had used closely spaced columns in an earlier building , it was Minoru Yamasaki who proposed that we use narrow windows in the WTC towers to give people a sense of security as they looked down from on high .
Our contribution was to make the closely spaced columns the fundamental lateral - force - resisting system for the two towers .
The tubular framing system also precluded the need for the customary 30 - foot column spacing in interior areas , making column - free , rentable space structurally desirable .
In support of Yamasaki ’s design , during the construction , before the windows were installed , I noticed that people felt comfortable walking up to the outside wall , placing their hands on the columns to either side , and enjoying the wonderful view .
If the wind was blowing toward them , they would walk right up to the outside wall ; however , if they felt even a trace of pressure from a breeze from behind , they would at least hesitate before walking to within five feet of the wall . . . and many would not approach the wall at all .
Another structural innovation was the outrigger space frame , which structurally linked the outside wall to the services core .
This system performed several functions .
First , gravity - induced vertical deformations between the columns of the services core and the columns of the outside wall were made equal at the top of the building ; at other levels , the differential deformations were ameliorated .
Second , wind - induced overturning moments were resisted in part by the columns of the services core , thus providing additional lateral stiffness .
Finally , the weight of , and the wind - induced overturning moment from the rooftop antenna ( 440 feet tall ) was distributed to all columns in the building . . . adding additional redundancy and toughness to the design .
Prefabricated structural steel was used to an unprecedented degree .
Two examples will give you an idea .
Exterior wall panels three stories high and three columns wide were fabricated in Washington state .
Floor panels 60 feet long and 20 feet wide , complete with profiled metal deck and electrical distribution cells , were assembled in New Jersey from components fabricated in Missouri and elsewhere .
We mounted a comprehensive program to determine the design - level gradient wind speed for New York City .
Data were collected from all available sources and incorporated into an appropriate mathematical model .
For the first time , we were able to obtain full - scale measurements of the turbulent structure of the wind and compare them with the turbulent structure obtained in a boundary - layer wind tunnel .
This was done by mounting anemometers atop three high points in lower Manhattan and by making similar measurements on our wind tunnel model ( Figure 1 see PDF version ) .
The boundary - layer wind tunnel was further developed and used to predict the steady - state and dynamic forces on the structure and the glazing , as well as to develop the dynamic component of wind - induced motion of the structure .
Jensen and Frank , two brilliant Danish engineers , had discovered that surface roughness in the wind tunnel allowed them to accurately predict wind pressures on farm structures .
We expanded this technology upward to 110 stories by using a wind tunnel , constructed under the guidance of Dr. Jack E. Cermak , ( NAE , Colorado State University ) , designed to study the dispersion of gases emitted from tall stacks .
Thus , for the first time , we were able to analyze the steady - state and dynamic components of wind - induced structure deflections .
We designed motion simulators to determine acceptable levels of wind - induced structure motion .
The simulators measured the response of human subjects to lateral motions similar to those anticipated for the two towers .
The accumulated data were used to establish the criteria for an acceptable level of the swaying motion of the two towers .
A viscoelastic damping system was invented and patented to ameliorate the wind - induced dynamic component of building motion by dissipating much of the energy of that motion . . . acting more or less like shock absorbers in an automobile .
With these dampers , we could control the swaying motion without having to use large quantities of structural steel .
This was the first time engineered dampers were used to resist the wind - induced swaying motion of a building .
A theory was developed for integrating the statistical strength of glass with the dynamic forces of the wind to predict the breakage rate of the glass of the exterior wall .
Coupled with a testing program of actual glass samples , we were able to determine rationally the necessary thickness and grade of the glass .
Another theory was developed to predict stack action and temperature - induced and wind - induced airflow within a high - rise building ; an understanding of these airflows is crucial to controlling fire - generated smoke and reducing the energy consumption of the building .
A theory to predict appropriate “ parking floors ” for elevators was developed to minimize the oscillation of elevator cables , which oscillation is stimulated by the wind - induced , swaying motion of a building .
Figure 2 is a comparison of the wind - induced dynamic components of the structure response of the two towers and of the Empire State Building .
The two towers were the first structures outside of the military and nuclear industries designed to resist the impact of a jet airliner , the Boeing 707 .
It was assumed that the jetliner would be lost in the fog , seeking to land at JFK or at Newark .
To the best of our knowledge , little was known about the effects of a fire from such an aircraft , and no designs were prepared for that circumstance .
Indeed , at that time , no fireproofing systems were available to control the effects of such fires .
We developed the concept of and made use of the fire - rated shaft - wall partition system , which is now widely used in place of masonry and plaster walls .
At that time , masonry was the standard enclosure for elevators , stairs , duct shafts , and other internal structures .
The partition system eliminates the need for within - the - shaft scaffolding , which was the common practice , provides more smoke - proof stairs and shafts , and improves safety on the job site .
The shaft - wall completely changed the nature of the structural system for the two towers , making them the first of a new kind of high - rise building .
A computerized system was conceived and developed for ordering structural steel and producing shop drawings for structural steel , as well as the operation of digitally directed tools , all directly from digital information developed as a part of our design .
When the two towers were finished , the World Trade Center stood proud , strong , and tall .
Indeed , with little effort , the towers shrugged off the efforts of terrorist bombers in 1993 to bring them down .
The events of September 11 , however , are not well understood by me . . . and perhaps cannot really be understood by anyone .
So I will simply state matters of fact :
The events of September 11 ended the lives of almost 2,900 people , many of them snuffed out by the collapse of structures designed by me .
The damage created by the impact of the aircraft was followed by raging fires , which were enormously enhanced by the fuel aboard the aircraft .
The temperatures above the impact zones must have been unimaginable ; none of us will ever forget the sight of those who took destiny into their own hands by leaping into space .
It appears that about 25,000 people safely exited the buildings , almost all of them from below the impact floors ; almost everyone above the impact floors perished , either from the impact and fire or from the subsequent collapse .
The structures of the buildings were heroic in some ways but less so in others .
The buildings survived the impact of the Boeing 767 aircraft , an impact very much greater than had been contemplated in our design ( a slow - flying Boeing 707 lost in the fog and seeking a landing field ) .
Therefore , the robustness of the towers was exemplary .
At the same time , the fires raging in the inner reaches of the buildings undermined their strength .
In time , the unimaginable happened . . . wounded by the impact of the aircraft and bleeding from the fires , both of the towers of the World Trade Center collapsed .
Figure 3 shows the comparative energy of impact for the Mitchell bomber that hit the Empire State Building during World War II , a 707 , and a 767 .
The energy contained in the fuel is shown in Figure 4 .
Considerations of larger aircraft are shown in Figures 5 and 6 .
The physical sizes of these aircraft are compared with the size of the floor plate of one of the towers in Figure 7 .
These charts demonstrate conclusively that we should not and cannot design buildings and structures to resist the impact of these aircraft .
Instead , we must concentrate our efforts on keeping aircraft away from our tall buildings , sports stadiums , symbolic buildings , atomic plants , and other potential targets .
The extent of damage to the World Trade Center is almost beyond comprehension .
Figure 8 shows an overview of the site and the location of the various buildings .
We did not design the superstructures of Building 3 ( Marriott Hotel ) or of Building 7 .
Towers 1 and 2 , which were totally destroyed , left behind utter chaos surrounded by towers of naked structural steel .
The remaining steel towers were in some ways painful beyond belief , in other ways strangely beautiful .
Building 3 collapsed down to a structural transfer level designed by us .
Fortunately , the people who sought refuge in the lobby of the hotel , which was located immediately below the transfer level , survived .
Buildings 4 , 5 , and 6 remained standing but were partially collapsed by falling debris ; all three burned for about 24 hours .
Although there was nothing special about the structural design of these buildings , the remaining structures stalwartly resisted the impacts of the wrecking ball .
Building 7 , after burning for nearly 10 hours , collapsed down to a structural transfer level designed by us .
The below - grade areas under Towers 1 and 2 were almost totally collapsed ; in areas outside of the towers they were partially damaged or collapsed .
In my mind , the loss of life and the loss of the buildings are somehow separated .
Thoughts of the thousands who lost their lives as my structures crashed down upon them come to me at night , rousing me from sleep , and interrupting my thoughts at unexpected times throughout the day .
Those who were trapped above the impact floors , those who endured the intense heat only to be crushed by falling structure , are merged with those who chose to take control of their own destinies by leaping from the towers .
The loss of the buildings is more abstract .
The buildings represented about 10 years of concerted effort both in design and in construction on the part of talented men and women from many disciplines .
It just is n’t possible for me to take the posture that the towers were only buildings . . . that these material things are not worthy of grieving .
It would be good to conclude this journey in a positive mode .
We have received almost a thousand letters , e-pistles , and telephone calls in support of our designs .
The poignant letters from those who survived the event and from the families of those who both did and did not survive cannot help but bring tears to one ’s eyes .
They have taught me how little I know of my own skills and how fragile are the emotions that lie within me .
Yes , I can laugh , I can compose a little story . . . but I can not escape .
Do those communications help ?
In some ways they do ; in others , they are constant reminders of my own limitations .
In essence , the overly laudatory comments only heighten my sense that , if I were as farseeing and talented as the letters would have me be , the buildings would surely have been even more stalwart , would have stood even longer . . . would have allowed even more people to escape .
Yes , no doubt I could have made the towers braver , more stalwart .
Indeed , the power to do so rested almost solely with me .
The fine line between needless conservatism and appropriate increases in structural integrity can only be defined after careful thought and consideration of all of the alternatives .
But these decisions are made in the heat of battle and in the quiet of one ’s dreams .
Perhaps , if there had been more time for the dreaming . . .
Recognition must be given to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , who provided unparalleled support and guidance throughout the design and construction of the World Trade Center .
Their understanding of the need to explore new avenues and break new ground reflected their sound professional and technical posture .
We could not have asked for a more competent , more responsible , or more involved client .
The men and women of our company who participated in the design and construction are without parallel .
Their talents , energies , and good humor carried us through a most arduous journey .
Dr. Alan G. Davenport ( NAE ) provided invaluable knowledge , insight , and support ; his willingness to join us on this journey made many facets of the design possible .
Minoru Yamasaki and his team , particularly Aaron Schreier , and the office of Emery Roth and Sons produced a wonderful architecture while making the entire process both fun and exciting .
Richard T. Baum ( NAE ) , of Jaros , Baum & Bolles , headed the HVAC ( heating , ventilation , air conditioning ) team and taught me much about these systems .
Joseph R. Loring provided full professional services as the electrical engineer for the project .
In conclusion , the events of September 11 have profoundly affected the lives of countless millions of people .
To the extent that the structural design of the World Trade Center contributed to the loss of life , the responsibility must surely rest with me .
At the same time , the fact that the structures stood long enough for tens of thousands to escape is a tribute to the many talented men and women who spent endless hours toiling over the design and construction of the project . . . making us very proud of our profession .
Surely , we have all learned the most important lesson — that the sanctity of human life rises far above all other values .
An AT&T upgrade program for BlackBerries has listed a 32 GB iPhone as a trade - in option .
Simultaneously , Canadian cellular provider Rogers may be preparing for another summer iPhone release .
Apple 's attempts to keep its iPhone plans silent may have become that much harder on Friday through a potential discovery of the larger - capacity iPhone in AT&T 's system .
A BlackBerry Bold trade - up program run on behalf of AT&T , albeit by a third party , shows an " iPhone 32 GB 3G " as one of the phones that can be handed in to get cash towards the Research in Motion smartphone .
As Phone Arena notes , the handset is listed as worth $ 335 , though it 's unlikely this is connected to any final pricing .
At this point , it 's uncertain whether this is a genuine addition or a speculative move on the part of the company running the service .
None of the other iPhones in the list are unreleased models .
However , it does follow an accidental post of a similar sort by T - Mobile Austria , which briefly showed a 32 GB iPhone in its " coming soon " section only to pull it shortly afterwards .
The 32GB iPhone listed as a trade - in choice for moving to an AT&T BlackBerry Bold .
Whatever AT&T 's state of readiness , its northern neighbor Rogers is now believed to be signaling its own readiness to carry a third - generation iPhone .
A historical source of Boy Genius Report for information at the Canadian provider has provided early iPhone launch details that have it essentially repeating its approach to the iPhone 3 G 's debut last year .
Rogers does n't say for certain when the next iPhone launches but , according to the tipster , expects it sometime in July or August .
It will reportedly require once more that all iPhones be bought tied to three - year plans and that the initial wave of shoppers only buy one device each .
HUNTSVILLE , AL --
While Stephen Colbert playfully traded barbs with NASA in an effort to get his name splashed across a Marshall Space Flight Center - managed International Space Station piece , MediaFusion employees were quietly designing a patch that will put the Comedy Central star on what the space agency sees as his proper place -- a treadmill .
Huntsville 's MediaFusion designed the special patch that marks the exercise equipment - the COLBERT - the Combined Operational Load Bearing External Resistance Treadmill - station crews will now be able to jump on to get in a good workout in space .
" It was loads of fun to see it come together , " said Richard Williams , MediaFusion 's Huntsville spokesman .
" This was a great way for NASA to reach out to the public , and especially those twenty - somethings they want to engage . "
MediaFusion has a contract with NASA Headquarters , in Washington D.C. , to perform graphic design and communications work .
The company also works with Marshall to produce animated videos and graphics .
Colbert spent the past six weeks playfully jabbing at the space agency to name a Marshall Space Flight Center - managed piece - Node 3 - of the space station after him , saying repetedly that NASA 's suggested names were " slightly less than inspiring and pretty much boring . "
Colbert was not satisfied with NASA 's suggested names : Earthrise , Legacy , Serenity and Venture .
The node Colbert wanted his name splashed across will be named " Tranquility . "
It is planned for a 2010 launch , but the COLBERT is slated to be placed on another segment of the International Space Station in August .
" So Tranquility is the box that houses the COLBERT , " Colbert told NASA astronaut Suni Williams who informed him on air of the decision to name the exercise equipment after him .
NASA counted more than 1.1 million votes and pondered , but opted to name the piece " Tranquility " instead of the top vote getter - Serenity .
NASA opted for " Tranquility " to honor Tranquility Base the location of man 's first landing on the moon -- the July 1969 Apollo 11 moon landing .
On Feb 20 , NASA asked for public suggestions to name the Marshall Space Flight Center - managed Node 3 , which will be used to expand the space station and connect other pieces of the floating laboratory being built by 15 nations .
Colbert was not easily diverted from the quest to extend his comedic empire into space .
He even offered to name himself the " Stephen Urine Filtration System " if NASA would name the piece after him .
NASA did not respond to his plea .
To view a video of Colbert 's elation over his new role within NASA watch below :
AG - selected party observers barred from taking notes , or video - taping long - sought manual tabulation of paper ballots from disputed 2006 election ...
Brad Friedman Byon 4/6/2009 , 11:52 am PT
We wrote late last week , in some detail , about Arizona AG Terry Goddard 's long overdue hand - count of paper ballots from the dubious 2006 Regional Transportation Authority ( RTA ) bond special election in Pima County ( Tucson ) .
The count of all 120,821 paper ballots from the election begins today in Phoenix as part of a criminal investigation , following years of allegations and court cases , in which a trans - partisan group of Election Integrity advocates in Tucson have sought transparency and public oversight following indications that Diebold tabulator databases may have been manipulated by election insiders .
Goddard 's restrictions on political party observers --- just one per party , selected by the AG , not by the parties themselves --- was the cause of criticism by all of the involved parties ( Republican , Democratic , Libertarian , etc. ) .
But a letter [ PDF ] late last week from the AG 's office indicated , at least , that a live , eight - camera video feed would be available on the Internet .
" Eight cameras will stream live video of the examination proceedings to the internet courtesy of the Maricopa County Elections Department , " the AG promised .
And , as the count began this morning , that feed is now up and running here .
Unfortunately , unlike Minnesota 's recent , very transparent hand - count of 2.9 million ballots from the state 's still - contested U.S. Senate race , the video from the Maricopa County Ballot Tabulation Center ( BTC ) is all but worthless , as critics had previously worried , in determining if counts are being carried out accurately .
Here are screen shots from this morning , as counting began , from all eight camera - views --- only two of which show any actual counting at all , while six of them are focused on different areas in the Phoenix counting facility ( click a photo to see the live streaming shot ) ...
As you can tell , the Internet streams are completely worthless as far as observing the accuracy of the ballot count in any way .
The two that do manage to be in the room where counting is going on , are far enough away that it 's impossible to actually overseen any of the counted ballots themselves .
Goddard had previous specified that there would be strict rules for AG - selected party observers , ensuring that it would be impossible for them to take any notes or document the counting in any way shape or form .
" [ N ] o cameras , no cell telephones , no writing instruments , and no audio or video recorders of any kind will be permitted within the examination room , " Deputy AG Donald E. Conrade wrote to all four party chairs in his March 23 , 2009 letter [ PDF ] .
Along with additional restrictions , the AG noted : " No representative will be permitted to communicate with anyone outside of the examination room while present in the examination room by signal , voice or other sign . "
A limited number of observers would be allowed outside the counting room , supposedly able to view the tabulation through glass windows .
However , based on the photos from the live streaming cams , as seen above , it 's difficult to figure out where an observer outside of the room would be able to determine if counting was , in any way , being done accurately .
" It 's a joke , " one of Pima County 's tireless election integrity advocates John Brakey , of Americans United for Democracy , Integrity , and Transparency in Elections AuditAZ , told us this morning as the counting began .
Though he traveled 120 miles from Tucson to Phoenix for the counting , Brakey , one of the most vociferous of the local leaders in trying to bring transparency to Pima 's 2006 election , was barred by the state AG from the counting room .
While Goddard 's office had earlier explained that " this is a criminal investigation , not an elections process controlled by applicable Arizona election laws , " it 's difficult to fathom what the point is in even streaming Internet video feeds at all , if the AG - selected " observers " are unable to document anything in any way , observers outside the glass are blind to the actual counting , and what 's seen above is all that will be made available to the rest of the world .
So much for transparency or public oversight in AG Goddard 's ballot count , brought about due to the years - long demand for transparency and public oversight of the disputed 2006 special election .
As more breaks ... if it breaks ... and as we 're able to learn it from our sources at the counting facility in Phoenix ... we 'll do our best to keep you abreast with what 's going on ...
Days after 9/11 , the Bush administration , operating under a cloak of secrecy , issued a series of classified memos that claimed unprecedentedly broad authority to use the U.S. military inside the United States in going after terrorists , even claiming that Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures did not always apply .
The long - secret memos , released this week by the Justice Department , shed light on not only the government 's immediate response to the 9/11 attacks but its legal basis for seven years of counterterrorism efforts .
For years , the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups have tried to use the courts as a lever to pry loose the legal opinions used to support the government 's wiretapping program , its extraordinary rendition of terrorism suspects , and a variety of other post - 9/11 efforts aimed at fighting terrorism .
But it was the Obama administration 's choice to release a handful of memos from the White House Office of Legal Counsel , which issues directives to guide actions of the executive branch .
One memo declared that the military — and , by extension , the president — had nearly unlimited power to act domestically against perceived threats .
" We think that the better view is that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to domestic military operations designed to deter and prevent future terrorist attacks , " said one opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel dated Oct. 23 , 2001 .
First Amendment rights to free speech and a free press would also " potentially be subordinated to overriding military necessities , " according to the memos .
The documents represent a sweeping view of executive power , says Jon Michaels , a professor of national security law at the UCLA School of Law .
" Most shocking to me is the extent to which domestic military operations trump the Fourth Amendment , " he says .
According to the memo , the U.S. military can be deployed widely inside the country without being subject to constitutional limits , a situation that would deprive citizens of some protections laid out in the Bill of Rights .
The military , in the Bush administration 's view , had broad legal authority to search and seize documents or persons and property and the authority to keep people under surveillance when it was engaged in counterterrorism operations .
Bush 's Justice Department also claimed that the U.S. military had the power to intercept Americans ' communications without a warrant .
Also contained in the memos was a legal justification for rendering prisoners to countries suspected of torture , despite the provisions of the United Nations Convention Against Torture .
Taken as a whole , the Office of Legal Counsel 's opinions asserted that Congress had a subordinate role to that of the president in matters of national security .
In the closing months of the Bush administration , the OLC firmly reversed much of the legal justification for those post - 9/11 memos .
The outgoing head of the OLC wrote that the opinions were crafted at a unique and unprecedented time .
Those opinions " should not be treated as authoritative for any purpose , " the OLC stated in October 2008 .
Government lawyers concluded that some of the legal rationale for the opinions was doubtful , particularly the interpretation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
The OLC further reversed as " unconvincing " the legal basis for opinions issued in 2001 and 2002 that said the president had " unconstrained discretion " to discard obligations enshrined in international treaties .
So by now everyone out there has heard of this Stephen Colbert gentleman , right ?
He ’s the guy with the swooping eagles and the American flags .
He stands up to bears , and stands up for Doritos .
Alright , now that we ’re all on the same page , how about we try something new ?
Something interactive !
Quick , by a show of hands , who out there thinks that Stephen Colbert — the person from the teevee — is a fictional character whose conservative viewpoints are exaggerated for comedic effect ?
Keep ’em up !
Now look around you .
Apparently , unless you ’re at a stop on the Glenn Beck Comedy Tour or , I do n’t know , Rick Santorum ’s house all the hands are up .
Otherwise , everyone ’s just scratching his head … all confused - like .
Why ?
Well , here ’s the science !
( From a study conducted by researchers at The Ohio State University )
Using data from an experiment , we found that individual - level political ideology significantly predicted perceptions of Colbert ’s political ideology .
Additionally , there was no significant difference between the groups in thinking Colbert was funny , but conservatives were more likely to report that Colbert only pretends to be joking and genuinely meant what he said while liberals were more likely to report that Colbert used satire and was not serious when offering political statements .
Conservatism also significantly predicted perceptions that Colbert disliked liberalism .
Jiminy Christmas !
Did you see what they said ?
They said the wingnuts do n’t realize Colbert is a character !
There ’s a huge chunk of people — folks who can be separated by political ideology — who think it ’s not an act .
They think Lou Dobbs + Bill O’Reilly = Stephen Colbert !
Nevermind that Colbert himself told 1,000 - year - old sarcophagus Morley Safer that he does n’t even let his own kids watch the show because he does n’t want them to confuse the character he plays on TV with their actual dad :
“ It ’s just like a pure silly thing .
But you know , I truck in insincerity .
With a very straight face , I say things I do n’t believe , ” Colbert tells Safer .
“ Kids ca n’t understand irony or sarcasm , and I do n’t want them to perceive me as insincere , ” Colbert says , “ Because one night , I ’ll be putting them to bed and I ’ll say … ‘ I love you , honey . ’
And they ’ll say , ‘ I get it .
Very dry , Dad .
That ’s good stuff , ' ” jokes Colbert .
Ha ha , very dry indeed .
But guess what , Stephen Colbert .
Apparently kids are n’t the only ones who do n’t understand irony or sarcasm .

1. Introduction
2 . The broader issues
Is a global model useful at all ?
If global models can be useful , is it appropriate to use the equations of World3 as a base for a new model ?
Perhaps the best known global model of all is World3 , popularized in the bookby Donella H. Meadows , Dennis L. Meadows , Jørgen Randers , and William W. Behrens III .
I have taken some of the equations in the latest version of the World3 model ( World3 - 03 ) and I have added some more data and feedback loops to reflect some of our present knowledge of climate change and energy issues ( there are n’t any energy variables in the model , the closest one is “ non-renewable resources ” ) .
The aim is to have a model that is more useful for the purpose of testing in theory different policies that could be applied to resolve some of the current challenges our world is facing , that have all at the root the fact that we are reaching the limits to growth .
Before going into the details of the model I propose , it ’s worth asking if there ’s any purpose in the exercise at all .
Specifically , these two questions need asking :
These are my personal answers to those questions :
2.1 . Is a global model useful at all ?
One of the criticisms levelled at World3 , that has been often repeated with other global models , is that there is so much uncertainty in so many of the relevant variables , that there is n’t any point in the exercise of modelling at all .
While it ’s true that there is a lot of uncertainty , it ’s worth remembering that this wo n’t stop people making models of the world .
Even if there were no computer models of the world at all , people still have mental models , rough ideas of where the world is heading in many different aspects .
And what ’s more , decision - making and policies will be based on those mental models .
So there is a very valid justification for any attempt to make those mental models as correct as we can , with whatever tools we have .
A computer model containing the best available data and reviewed by experts seems likely to produce insights into the future of a better quality than the hunches of policy makers .
2.2 . If global models can be useful , is it appropriate to use the equations of World3 as a base for a new model ?
Modelling has advanced a lot since the original World3 , and there are good arguments to say that incorporating new equations and variables to World3 is n’t appropriate .
However , I believe there are several advantages to this approach , the main one that many experts have already studied World3 and are familiar with it , and their observations may be also relevant to a new model that contains many of its equations .
3 . The proposed model
3.1 . Energy variables Energy variables are conspicuously absent from World3 .
The closest thing to an energy variable is “ non-renewable resources ” , that is meant to include not only fossil fuels , but also minerals and other resources .
When considering how to best include energy in the model , I chose to eliminate the variable “ non-renewable resources ” , on the grounds that , in a world with unlimited energy , any chemical compounds useful as a raw material but not as an energy source could be easily obtained ( if necessary , elements found rarely on Earth could be mined from other parts of the Solar System , or created with the appropriate nuclear reactions ) .
Fossil fuels are the only true non-renewable resources .
To incorporate energy issues in the New World Model , I had to create three new sets of equations : equations about energy supply , equations about energy demand , and equations about energy source allocation .
Most models I have seen model only energy demand or supply , but this is clearly insufficient .
Modelling energy demand and assuming that it will somehow be met ignores the important issues of fossil fuel depletion .
Modelling energy supply and ignoring demand does n’t help to judge the soundness of policy proposals to switch usage of fossil fuels by “ clean electricity ” , which often sweep under the carpet the question of where the electricity may come from and the energy losses of any conversion of other energy sources to electricity .
3.1.1 . Modelling energy supply
To model energy supply , I distinguished six types of energy sources : coal , oil , gas , nuclear power , renewable electricity , renewable thermal and biomass .
The distinctions were made based on the differences between them in renewability and usability for the different types of demand .
Energy sources similar in both counts were grouped together .
The estimates on ultimate reserves for fossil fuels were taken from Jean Laherrere .
Fossil fuel production was determined by two factors : demand and possibility of supply .
When it ’s possible to supply the demand , production equals demand .
When demand falls sharply , production will drop but keep some inertia .
When demand goes up , production may or may not increase , depending on the amount of fossil fuel remaining .
The equation that determines the maximum increase in production for fossil fuels is :
Increase in production = 0.2 *( fraction of fossil fuel remaining - 0.5 ) * current production
This means that at the beginning of exploitation of a resource it ’s possible to increase production very quickly , up to 10 % a year .
When half of the reserves have been produced , production reaches its peak and ca n’t increase any more .
From that point onwards , production will always decline .
One important aspect of the modelling of energy supply was calculating declining EROEIs ( Energy Returned On Energy Invested ) of non-renewable resources .
The available data on EROEI is very spotty , but it ’s such a crucial concept to explain what may happen in the future with energy sources that I believe a model would be inaccurate if it did n’t include it in some way .
The energy source that has been most studied for declining EROEI in time is oil .
Available data for oil in the USA is the following ( Charles Hall , 2008 ) :
1930 – About 100:1
1970 – About 30:1
2000 – About 11-18:1
This suggests a relationship between EROEI and the fraction of remaining oil that is approximately proportional to the square of the fraction of oil remaining :
EROEI of oil = ( fraction of oil remaining2 ) *
100
An additional reason to go for this simple relationship is because it has the following property : it takes the same amount of energy to extract the first half of the oil as it takes to extract half of the remainder ( a quarter ) , and so on .
This fits well with the intuitive idea of declining EROEI .
However , the data is too limited to say this formula holds true with any certainty , and I ’m using it only as a best guess .
The results of the model are similar if other declining functions are used .
Once the EROEIs of all energy sources are calculated , the weighted average is then used to estimate the fraction of industrial capital needed to obtain energy .
This again is speculative , but a couple of datapoints are known : at an EROEI of 1:1 , 100 % of the industrial capital would be needed .
At high EROEIs , it appears that 5 % of the industrial capital is used ( from the “ cheese slicer model ” by Charles Hall , Robert Powers , and William Schoenberg , 2008 ) .
The intermediate points can be estimated by assuming that the fraction of industrial capital needed is roughly proportional to the amount of energy needed as an input for energy production .

3.1.2 . Modelling energy demand
One factor that many energy models seem to forget is that people do n’t demand energy sources like oil , nuclear power or hydro .
What people actually demand is electricity , heating and transport .
Electricity demand is calculated in the model as a function of GDP , with the data based on historical data for electricity consumption from the World Development Indicators Database .
Heating demand is calculated as a constant of 400 kg oil eq. per capita per year .
Transport demand is calculated as the sum of the transport needed for freight and for passenger transport .
I could n’t find world data on freight and passenger transport , but it appears that both in the USA and the EU about 25 % of the energy use goes into freight and 75 % into passenger transport .
So I assumed the relationship holds for the rest of the world .
The total energy used for transport was deduced from the historical data on oil consumption .

3.1.3 . Modelling energy source allocation
Once demand and supply are calculated , matching them is a non-trivial exercise , as anybody who has looked at the electricity mix of any country can tell .
There are two fundamental ideas that I have used to do the matching : Market forces follow EROEI : the most efficient sources of energy are also the most profitable .
This seems to make sense intuitively but is disputed .
Energy companies are conservative : they will not start reducing the usage of an energy source until its EROEI falls below the average of all sources .
Also , the reduction or increase in any energy source is gradual .
My model successfully reflects historical changes in use of different energy sources with no other input but the variations of EROEI in time , which suggests that the approach ca n’t be entirely misguided .
The production data the model generates is only a rough approximation of the real data , but clearly on the right track , and further work on the relevant parameters could refine the results .
For a comparison , historical data on world production of fossil fuels can be found in work by the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency .
Graph 3.1.2.2 – A section of the flow diagram of the equations used to model energy source allocation .
3.2 . Carbon emissions Carbon emissions and climate change are absent from World3 , mostly because there was n’t much knowledge on the matter at the time .
For the purposes of including carbon emissions in the model , I took the equations for pollution in World3 and modified them .
Unfortunately , this means that the New World Model lost the original pollution equations ( clearly designed to represent chemical pollution ) , which may need to be re-introduced .
The calculation of carbon emissions is , of course , fundamentally different than the calculation of pollution , and is made by adding up the emissions from each of the fossil fuels and from land development ( deforestation ) .
Another important difference is the assimilation rate , which is clearly different for carbon dioxide and for chemical pollutants .
I could n’t find reliable information on carbon sinks , so the model only contains data for the known historical levels of carbon assimilation by the Global Carbon Budget Team , and extrapolates linearly from there , which is probably excessively conservative .
The model does n’t attempt to make any detailed analysis of climate change , but only an estimation of the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and its possible consequences for food production .
Climate change models can provide much greater detail into specific consequences of climate change , but this is n’t the aim of this model .
The aim , instead , is to estimate how climate change may affect other important variables in the world .

3.3 . Food production
The equations for agriculture were taken straight from the World3 model , with two importnt changes :
The land yield is affected by the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
There is still a lot of uncertainty on the effects on food crops of different levels of carbon dioxide , but there is agreement that climate change will reduce crop yield .
The model assumes 2 % reduction on yield at 370 ppm , based on current data on the reduction in crop yield so far ( David B Lobell and Christopher B Field , 2007 ) .
There is still a lot of discussion on future reductions on crop yield due to climate change .
This model assumes a 10 % reduction at 500 ppm , which seems like a reasonable figure based on the IPCC data .
If there are better figures available , I will include them .
Food production is reduced in proportion to the amount of biomass production .
3.4 . Economy World3 has several variables measured in dollars and some variables relevant to the economy , such as jobs .
This was never meant to model the economy such as understood by financial institutions , but rather the physical economy , the real things on the Earth that have physical limits .
Even so , it ’s surprising that the model did n’t contain a GDP variable , representing in some way the “ real ” GDP , meaning with this not inflation - adjusted but representing some aggregate measure of agriculture , industry and services produced .
I have added this variable to the New World Model , which also helps in the calculation of other minor variables that traditionally are based on GDP but that in World3 were using industrial output as a proxy for GDP .
3.5 Demographics and carrying capacity Because population is such a critical variable in the model , additional demographic variables were added to track if the historical values of population were on the right track : the global crude birth rate and the global crude death rate .
Adjustments were done whenever the demographic variables were going far off the track .
Two calculations of the carrying capacity of the Earth were added to the New World Model :
The maximum feedable population , representing the maximum population that could be fed at subsistence level with the current food production .
The maximum sustainable population , representing the maximum population that could live on the planet if the total human footprint was allowed to rise to 1 planet .
The calculation of human footprint was done by adding arable land , urban land and the land needed to absorb the current rate of generation of carbon emissions .
Both values vary with time as food production and human footprint change with time .
4 . The results of the model for the “ business as usual ” scenario
4.1 . Main variables : population , food and industrial output
In the “ business as usual ” scenario the pattern was one of collapse of human population , food production and industrial output , in a way similar to what happens in the World3 business as usual scenario .
The decline is gradual , starting somewhere around 2030 :
Graph 4.1.1 – Food production and industrial output in the New World Model
4.2 Energy usage Energy supplies are substituted for each other as EROEI declines , but eventually all fossil fuels and nuclear fuels are used up .
Renewables are n’t used until the end of the 21st century , due to their low EROEI :
Graph 4.2.1 – Energy usage graph
4.3 Carbon dioxide A remarkable result of the model in the business as usual scenario is that carbon emissions do n’t go very high , peaking at 510 ppm , which is lower than some of the emissions scenarios of the IPCC .
The reason for this is double :
Firstly , the limits on fossil fuel reserves mean that not as much carbon can reach the atmosphere as assumed by the IPCC even when all fossil fuels are burned .
Secondly , the estimations of carbon sinks may be too favourable in the model .
Graph 4.3.1 – Carbon dioxide and energy
4.4 . Standard of living
The standard of living declines clearly by all the reasonable measures that can be made in the model : food per capita , industrial output per capita , services per capita , life expectancy , human welfare index and child mortality .
The levels of food per capita by the end of the 21st century are similar to the beginning of the 20th century and are in a path of continuous decline .
However , this should n’t be taken as any kind of prediction , because the model cannot possibly include all the relevant data .
Graph 4.4.1 – Food per capita , industrial output per capita and service output per capita in the New World Model
Graph 4.4.2 – Life expectancy , human welfare index and child mortality
4.5 . Economic growth
The most interesting result of calculating GDP is that it allows for the estimation of economic growth .
This should not be understood as the figure that economists produce , but some kind of numeric estimate of the yearly change in all the goods and services produced in the world .
Interestingly , at the point of collapse , it falls dramatically , but it starts declining many years before that , providing an early warning signal .
It ’s also worthwhile noting that the point of peak oil is marked by a drop in economic growth .
It ’s very tempting , but not really justified , to relate this to our current economic crisis .
Certainly , if we were at the early stages of the collapse in economic growth that the model estimates , it ’s to be expected that a major economic crisis would happen , and a big overhang of debt is one of the logical ways for it to happen , as a result of an effort from central banks to maintain a level of economic growth that is n’t justified by the fundamentals .
But I do n’t have enough data at present to confirm or deny if our current situation reflects that we are at the beginning of the great contraction estimated by the New World Model .
Graph 4.5.1 – Economic growth in the New World Model
5. Conclusions
The main conclusion of the results of the New World Model is that , if the world continues behaving as we have so far , decline is inevitable in the long run .
This is n’t a surprise and the fact that we are on an unsustainable path can be deduced from much simpler and reliable calculations .
What this model provides is some slightly more refined ideas about how this could happen and , more importantly , it ’s a tool where we can experiment with our ideas on how to solve this problem .
I am aware that I may have made many mistakes in producing this model , and I may have used data that is out of date or otherwise incorrect .
Please consider this as a first draft , and I welcome any input you may want to provide .
I would like to make this a collaborative effort .
The whole model can be downloaded from here .
The software to run the model is Vensim PLE , that can be downloaded from : www.vensim.com
Finally , I would like very much to receive input on possible policies to avoid decline and eventual collapse ( when all fossil fuels are consumed ) that could be included in this model to see what results they produce .
The Transition Network has already expressed interest in using this model for the timeline they are writing for all Transition Towns to help them design their own Energy Descent Action Plans .
Of course , this will only be useful if the model includes the policies that need to be implemented for a successful transition to a sustainable world .

That business model has been tremendously successful so successful that unlocked phones , while available in the U.S. , have never been able to take off .
Apple has also always had strong relationships with colleges and universities , so we 're sure to see educational discounts to promote the iPad as a virtual textbook .
The iPad 's monthly fee will be a sticking point , of course , but it 's not an insurmountable one .
Verizon 's new Open Development Initiative has been letting makers of non-voice devices roll their own service plans .
The ODI has n't been used for a big consumer device yet , but it could let Apple roll out an iPad with bucket plans for data at various tiers ; an on - device data meter could tell people when it 's time to buy more .
So far , the ODI has n't been compatible with subsidies , but Verizon seems to be very enthusiastic about working with Apple ; maybe together they could make this work .
The big question is whether Apple will release an iPad at its next big press event on June 8 , or whether it will decide to wait .
Typically , Apple announces products in June , September-ish and January - ish .
It will announce the iPad when it 's ready , whenever that is .

They should be preparing new business models for the new world where anyone can access Web content on a large - format pad , anywhere , at any time .
Tom Riall expressed " deep regret " over the incident
The boss of a speed camera firm has been banned from driving for six months after admitting speeding at more than 100 mph on a 70 mph road in Suffolk .
Tom Riall , 49 , is a chief executive of Serco , which has provided more than 5,000 speed cameras in the UK .
He appeared at Sudbury Magistrates ' Court and pleaded guilty to driving at 102.9 mph on the A14 on 4 January , 2009 .
Riall was fined £ 300 , banned from driving for six months and had six points added to his licence .
Riall , from Ufton Nervet , near Reading , was caught speeding in his blue Volvo by a police patrol car on the eastbound dual carriageway just before 1300 BST , the court heard .
Outside court , he said : " I accept the decision of the court .
I recognise that speeding is not acceptable .
" I very much regret what happened and I have made a full apology to the court . "
On Serco 's website it states the company prides itself on providing " robust evidence " of drivers ' speeding .
I have rarely seen so many magpies around as now .
They are the rats of the avian world and , like rats , they unquestionably harm our ecology .
So keen is their survival instinct that even if we all went out and shot every one we could find , for weeks on end , there would still be millions of the blighters .
They are not , in my view , preferable to woodpeckers , tits , finches and other quite rightly protected species .
So , for the good of our wildlife , kill a magpie or six today : and feel free to take a jay or a crow with you while you are at it .
The bunny - huggers will hate you , but our beautiful birds will be much in your debt .
The European Parliament late last week agreed to extend musical copyrights from their current 50 - year term to 70 years .
So all that early rock 'n roll about to pass into the public domain ?
Do n't count on using it in your documentary for another two decades — and there 's nothing to say that the term wo n't be extended again .
While the vote is a big victory for the music labels who can continue to market major artists like The Beatles ( let 's face it , the obscure stuff from the 1950s is n't selling in measurable quantities anymore , and it's not playing on the radio ) , the movie industry looks set to cash in soon , too .
In passing the term extension , Parliament also asked the European Commission " to launch an impact assessment of the situation in the European audiovisual sector by January 2010 , with a view to deciding whether a similar copyright extension would benefit the audiovisual world . "
Compromise ?
The current musical term extension push began in February 2008 , when European Commissioner Charlie McCreevy of Ireland announced his support for a near doubling of the term of protection from 50 to 95 years .
The move was opposed by countries like the UK , which would only go along with a maximum term of 70 years , so the European Parliament eventually agreed to go with the lower number .
While dropping 25 years from the proposal has a whiff of " compromise " about it , it 's never been clear why any sort of term extension should be passed .
The whole issue was looked at quite carefully by the UK's Andrew Gowers during his hugely publicized report on intellectual property .
Gowers concluded in 2006 that no such term extension was needed — at which point the labels simply shifted their focus away from national governments to the EU .
Charlie McCreevy
But Gowers was operating in a UK context ; groups of continental academics have come to similar conclusions when looking at the data .
One group , headed by Prof. P. Bernt Hugenholtz of the University of Amsterdam , found that a copyright term extension would be a bad idea with costs for consumers , competitors , and society as a whole .
Despite being commissioned , paid for , and published by the European Commission , Hugenholtz 's work was n't even mentioned when McCreevy made his proposal ( though music industry work was considered ) .
This led Hugenholtz to blast off an angry letter about a process which " seems to reveal an intention to mislead the council and the Parliament , as well as the citizens of the European Union .
In doing so the Commission reinforces the suspicion , already widely held by the public at large , that its policies are less the product of a rational decision - making process than of lobbying by stakeholders . "
Another group of academics fired off an open letter to the Times of London in which they complained that the new plan would only pad the pockets of " record companies , aging rock stars or , increasingly , artists ' estates .
It does nothing for innovation and creativity . "
But forget Gowers and European academics — what claim do those pushing the idea of term extension make ?
The official legislative dossier tells us : " Once their performance fixed in a phonogram is no longer protected , around 7,000 performers in any of the big Member States and a correspondingly smaller number in the smaller Member States will lose all of their income that derives from contractual royalties and statutory remuneration claims from broadcasting and public communication of their performances in bars and discotheques . "
A tremendous loss to the German public domain is therefore enacted in order to help , for example , just 7,000 performers in all of Germany .
And how much will these musicians make ?
According to Commissioner McCreevy , an average of just ? 2,000 a year .
But , according to the UK - based Open Rights Group , this is n't about session musicians anyway .
Writing in the Telegraph recently , the group 's executive director said , " That argument is hard to swallow .
Firstly , two - thirds of the money that a recording generates is made in the first six years after publication .
We might conclude that if artists want to survive in their later years , record companies should ensure they invest in a pension , not depend of the vague hope of earnings from ancient recordings .
" Secondly , an analysis of the figures shows where the money really ends up .
About 80 percent will go to recording companies .
Of the rest , nearly all would go to big stars , and a very small percentage to the small artists the Directive claims to be all about . "
Another UK academic at the University of Bournemouth says that a slightly lower 70 percent of all new revenues will go to the record labels , not the performers ; in any event , most of the money goes to labels that have already had five decades to profit from the songs in question .
Under the new law , artists could regain their rights to songs that are no longer offered for sale to the public , but in the era of digital distribution , why would n't a label just throw its whole back catalog up on iTunes ?
Sweet harmonies
The extension still needs approval by the European Council ( made up of the EU member states ) , but the only real sticking point there appears to have been the 95 - year period .
With the term reduced to 70 years , that measure looks set to pass into law .
When the UK government balked last month at the 95 - year term , British music trade group BPI called on the government " to match its supportive rhetoric with concrete action , by moving heaven and earth to reach an agreement under this EU Presidency that will deliver an improved term of copyright for performers and music companies . "
Heaven and earth appeared to have been moved , all in the name of " harmonization " of copyright terms .
Only a day before the vote last week , international music trade group IFPI made the harmonization point clearly :
" Europe has always prided itself on being a champion of culture , yet the EU is lagging behind many other parts of the world when it comes to protecting its recordings , " it said .
" European artists , performers and producers are provided with a 50 year period of protection for their work to enable them to benefit from the recordings they have made .
This is a much lower level of protection than many other countries around the world which provide for between 60 and 95 years ' protection . "
Even within the EU , terms are grossly unequal in duration ( authors get life plus 70 years , for instance , for their books ) .
While this might sounds like an argument for " harmonizing " terms downward , it never is ; harmonization moves only in the upward direction .
It 's a transparent strategy that Big Content has been pushing for years — encourage countries to extend copyright terms , then browbeat others into following suit by going on about " competitive disadvantage . "
As for the public domain , there 's no point even arguing about it — such groups simply take it for granted that copyright is a natural state and that " falling out of copyright " is an obvious evil .
As IFPI put it last week , " More treasures of Europe 's recorded music heritage are falling out of copyright every year .
These are the recordings which have contributed so much to Europe 's reputation for creativity and cultural diversity .
With today 's longer life spans , artists and performers are beginning to see their recordings falling into the public domain in their lifetime .
Every year , an increasing number of artists are being deprived of part of their income . "
But deprivation goes both ways .
Every time that a term extension is passed , the public is deprived of the chance to remix , mashup , sample , share , and otherwise build upon the cultural work of a half century before .

The Internet and file - sharing networks like BitTorrent have shifted music promotion from the labels to the people .
Increasingly , record labels are losing control over what music the masses are listening to , and according to some musicians this is is actually a good thing .
Meet Chris Zabriskie , a full - time musician whose career started roughly 8 years ago .
Like many other artists , Chris has decided to give all of his music away for free .
This is n’t down to Chris lacking a desire for money , but because he thinks that his music should be heard – and that it ’s pretty much impossible to sell music nowadays without giving the public the option to “ try before they buy . ”
Zabriskie , himself an avid BitTorrent user , said he has leaked all of his albums on torrent sites ahead of their official release date .
And he ’s not the only one doing this .
“ I can tell you from numerous conversations and firsthand experience that there are few artists left , even in the big leagues , that do not .
You wonder where the early leaks come from ?
Do n’t be so surprised . ” he writes .
People are not going to buy any albums before they ’ve had a chance to listen to them , or before they ’ve seen the artist perform live , Zabriskie reasons .
Indeed , the top 1 % of all artists might still be able to sell an album based on their previous performances , but the average artist has to be heard first .
Much to the dislike of the RIAA , file - sharing networks are the preferred way for many people to sample music .
Zabriskie does n’t see file - sharing networks as a threat to musicians though , quite the opposite in fact .
“ No one should ever be upset that people are downloading their record for free .
They ’re listening to it .
And chances are they will buy it someday if they like it .
Someone who does n’t buy it still would n’t have bought it if they did n’t download it , so what ’s the worry ? ”
In fact , much like radio , file - sharing networks are a great way to promote music .
Zabriskie discovered this himself , as one of his tracks appeared on the famous Indie / Rock Playlist torrent in February 2008 .
Many artists have seen an increase in their fanbase after one of their tracks appeared in these playlists , since they were downloaded by tens of thousands of people .
“ It ’s really cool , just one person ’s mixtape , but a great way for people all around the world to see what ’s going on in music that month .
So , very suddenly , tens of thousands of people from around Portland to Poland had that song on their computer .
How did Criznittle find it ?
I do n’t know , exactly .
But he did , and he liked it , and he shared it , and I found a lot of fans because of it ’ , ” Chris points out .
So what does this mean for the music industry , one might ask .
It is hard to predict the future of course , but it ’s clear that consumer to consumer promotion will be much more important than the marketing budgets of the major record labels .
Music is being freed from the corporate stranglehold , and although it ’s a challenge to find the right distribution method for the future , the artists and fans will come out as the winners .
Zabriskie ’s final words sum it up nicely .
“ Bottom line : if you like something you listen to , support the artist however you can .
If that means buying something , great .
If that means going to a live show , great .
If that means sharing it with a friend , great .
If that means blogging about it , great .
If that means requesting it on your local college radio station , great .
If that means just scrobbling it to Last . fm so people can see that you ’re enjoying it , great . ”
“ That ’s the future of music .
It ’s completely in your hands , not mine , not anyone else ’s who makes music .
Yours .
Do n’t let anyone judge you for how you choose to find and experience music .
The soundtrack to your life is up to you .
All music is free , everywhere .
Do n’t take that for granted .
Share it , disappear into it .
It ’s yours . ”
Amen .
We may not know what the Conficker authors have in store for us on April 1st , but I doubt many network administrators want to find out .
Maybe they do n’t have to : I ’ve been working with the Honeynet Project ’s Tillmann Werner and Felix Leder , who have been digging into Conficker ’s profile on the network .
What we ’ve found is pretty cool : Conficker actually changes what Windows looks like on the network , and this change can be detected remotely , anonymously , and very , very quickly .
You can literally ask a server if it ’s infected with Conficker , and it will tell you .
Tillmann and Felix have their own proof of concept scanner , and with the help of Securosis ‘ Rich Mogull and the multivendor Conficker Working Group , enterprise - class scanners should already be out from Tenable ( Nessus ) , McAfee / Foundstone , nmap , ncircle , and Qualys .
We figured this out on Friday , and got code put together for Monday .
It ’s been one heck of a weekend .
The technical details are not complicated — Conficker , in all its variants , makes NetpwPathCanonicalize ( ) work quite a bit differently than either the unpatched or the patched MS08 - 067 version — but I ’ll let Tillmann and Felix describe this in full in their “ Know Your Enemy ” paper , due out any day now with all sorts of interesting observations about this annoying piece of code .
( We did n’t think it made sense to hold up the scanner while finishing up a few final edits on the paper . )

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. employers cut 539,000 jobs last month , the fewest since October , according to government data on Friday that signaled the economy ’s steep decline might be easing and gave the stock market a boost .
The unemployment rate , however , soared to 8.9 percent , the highest since September 1983 , from 8.5 percent in March , and job losses in March and February were a combined 66,000 steeper than previously estimated , the Labor Department said .
A 72,000 jump in government payrolls tempered the overall job - loss figure .
Government employment was bolstered by the hiring of about 60,000 temporary workers in preparation for the 2010 census and U.S. Labor Secretary Hilda Solis said this figure would fluctuate in the months ahead .
Private sector employment fell by 611,000 in April after a 693,000 decline in March , the department said , which curbed some of the optimism over the report .
Still , the data was not as bleak as financial markets had expected and offered the freshest sign that the intensity of the recession , now in its 17th month , was starting to fade .
“ The labor report added to the growing list of data points that imply that the steepest part of the economic contraction is now past , ” said Brian Fabbri , chief North America economist at BNP Paribas in New York .
The payrolls reading , which beat market forecasts for a 590,000 drop , and results of the government ’s tests on the health of the 19 biggest domestic banks buoyed U.S. stocks .
The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 1.96 percent at 8,574.65 .
Government bond prices ended higher as unemployment was seen still rising well into 2010 .
President Barack Obama , whose government has rolled out a record $ 787 billion rescue package of spending and tax cuts , said April ’s payrolls number was somewhat encouraging , but that the job losses were still a sobering toll .
“ It underscores the point we ’re still in the midst of a recession that was years in the making and that is going to be months or even years in the unmaking .
We should expect further job losses in the months to come , ” Obama said .
Since the start of the recession in December 2007 , the U.S. economy has lost 5.7 million jobs , the Labor Department said .
In neighboring Canada , a surprise 35,900 jobs were added to payrolls in April , confounding analysts who had expected the economy to extend its pattern of heavy job losses .

GLIMMERS OF HOPE
In a hopeful glimmer for the U.S. economy , the rise in the unemployment rate reflected a surge in people joining the labor force , as opposed to a collapse in employment .
The report showed job losses across almost all sectors , although at a less steep pace than in previous months .
Manufacturing lost 149,000 jobs in April after shedding 167,000 in March .
Economists were heartened by a slight increase in hours worked in manufacturing , where the average work week inched up to 39.6 hours from 39.4 in March .
“ The very good news is that the hours in the manufacturing sector were up , which implies that we are going to have some production increases soon , if not in April for industrial production , perhaps in June at the latest , ” said Kurt Karl , chief U.S. economist at Swiss Re in New York .

Government data last week showed a record $ 103.7 billion drawdown in inventories in the first quarter .
Analysts reckon this created a platform for a recovery in manufacturing .
Construction , among sectors hit hardest by the housing - led recession , shed 110,000 jobs in April , the Labor Department said , after losing 135,000 the previous month .
The service - providing industry slashed 269,000 positions after cutting 381,000 in March , while in education and health services they rose 15,000 after increasing 10,000 in March .
Despite the slowdown in the pace of job losses , the unemployment rate will continue to rise until at least the first quarter of 2010 , peaking anywhere between 9.5 and 10.5 percent , according to economists .
“ It does look as if we are falling more slowly and we are likely to hit bottom reasonably soon , at least when it comes to economic growth , ” said Joel Naroff , chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland , Pennsylvania , but added :
“ We are looking at rising unemployment rates for quite some time even as job losses moderate . ”
The length of the average work week was unchanged at 33.2 hours in April .
Average hourly earnings edged up to $ 18.51 from $ 18.50 in March , which analysts said was a reminder that incomes remained under pressure .
“ The figures gave a cautionary warning about consumer incomes , ” said Nigel Gault , chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington , Massachusetts .
“ ( The modest rise in ) hourly earnings , which combined with the heavy loss of jobs signals a continuing decline in overall wage and salary incomes , is bad news for purchasing power . ”
A separate report from the Commerce Department showed wholesale inventories dropped 1.6 percent to $ 411.7 billion , the lowest since November 2007 , after falling a record 1.7 percent in February .
Adam Serwer writes about Jay Bybee ’s attempt to get off the hook :
So Bybee knew he was breaking the law in allowing the use of torture , but you have to understand , he only did it because he really wanted to be a federal judge .
That ’s not exculpatory information , that ’s motive .
Exactly right .
But you have to understand what Bybee is : he ’s someone who made a career as a movement conservative apparatchik .
In his world , following orders and getting rewarded for his obedience was what it was all about ; he ’s completely shocked to find that the rules have changed .
And here ’s the thing : most prominent Republicans are just the same .
We wonder how someone as hapless as John Boehner could be minority leader , why one Congressman after another abjectly apologizes to Rush Limbaugh , and so on ; the answer is that they ’re hollow men , careerists who thought they had a safe ride .
If someone like Newt Gingrich seems like a giant in his party these days , that ’s because , say what you like about him ( and I do n’t like much about him ! ) , he got into the business when doing so involved taking some actual risks .
And that , I think , is why the Republicans have fallen apart so completely since losing the election .
Careerism is what held the party together ; an environment in which the party no longer has the patronage to reward all its loyalists , and may not even be able to protect apparatchiks who broke the law , destroys the whole system .
Now , there are a lot of people with real conviction in the GOP these days .
Unfortunately , those convictions include the idea that Barack Obama is a socialist , or maybe a fascist , that gays are the greatest threat we face , and … well , you get the picture .
It ’s a fervent base , but not , unless Obama really really messes up , an election - winning coalition .
Sic transit — and good riddance .

Fed and Treasury - Putting off Hard Choices with Easy Money ( and Probable Chaos )
John P. Hussman , Ph.D .

Brief remark - from early reports regarding the toxic assets plan , it appears that the Treasury envisions allowing private investors to bid for toxic mortgage securities , but only to put up about 7 % of the purchase price , with the TARP matching that amount - the remainder being " non-recourse " financing from the Fed and FDIC .
This essentially implies that the government would grant bidders a put option against 86 % of whatever price is bid .
This is not only an invitation for rampant moral hazard , as it would allow the financing of largely speculative and inefficently priced bids with the public bearing the cost of losses , but of much greater concern , it is a likely recipe for the insolvency of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , and represents a major end - run around Congress by unelected bureaucrats .
---
Last week , the Federal Reserve announced its intention to purchase a trillion dollars worth of Treasury debt by creating the little pieces of paper in your pocket that have " Federal Reserve Note " inscribed at the top .
In effect , the Fed intends to monetize the Treasury debt in an amount that exceeds the entire pre-2008 monetary base of the United States .
Apparently , the Fed believes that absorbing part of the massively expanding government debt and maybe lowering long - term rates by a fraction of a percentage point will increase the capacity and incentive of the markets to purchase risky and toxic debt .
Bernanke evidently believes that the choice between a default - free investment and one that is entirely open to principal loss comes down to a few basis points in interest .
Even now , the expansion of federal spending as a fraction of GDP has clear inflationary implications looking a few years out , so any expectation that long - term Treasury yields will fall in response to the Fed 's buying must be coupled with the belief that investors will ignore those inflation risks .
There is no doubt that the Fed also intends for the extra trillion in base money to end up as bank reserves .
But think about what this move implies in equilibrium .
The largest purchasers of U.S. Treasury bonds at present are foreign central banks .
So what the Fed is really doing is printing enough money to crater the exchange value of the U.S. dollar , while leaving foreigners with a trillion dollars of savings that they would otherwise have invested in Treasury bonds , which they will now use , not to buy our lousy , toxic assets , but to acquire our productive assets , and at a steep discount thanks to the currency depreciation .
So yes , the extra trillion in dollar bills will ultimately end up as bank reserves ( and currency in circulation ) , but only by encouraging Beijing to go on a shopping spree to acquire a claim on our future production .
Ultimately , funding the bailout of lousy assets comes at the cost of debasing our currency and selling our good assets to foreigners .
Make no mistake - we are selling off our future and the future of our children to prevent the bondholders of U.S. financial corporations from taking losses .
We are using public funds to protect the bondholders of some of the most mismanaged companies in the history of capitalism , instead of allowing them to take losses that should have been their own .
All our policy makers have done to date has been to squander public funds to protect the full interests of corporate bondholders .
Even Bear Stearns ' bondholders can expect to get 100 % of their money back , thanks to the generosity of Bernanke , Geithner and other bureaucrats eager to hand out the money of ordinary Americans .
Though I believe that the consequences ( via credit default swaps and the like ) are overstated of letting bondholders take a haircut , and will ultimately be no worse than having the public take the losses , the fact is that we do n't even need the bonds of major financial institutions to go into default .
What we do need to do is offer those bondholders a choice :
1 ) The U.S. government takes receivership of the financial institution , changes the management , wipes out the stockholders and a chunk of the bondholders claims entirely , continues the operation of the institution in receivership , eventually reissues the company to private ownership , and leaves the bondholders with the residual .
This is not " nationalization , " but receivership - a form of " pre-packaged bankruptcy " that protects the customers and allows the institution to continue to operate , followed by re-privatization .
As I 've previously noted , this would fully protect all of the customers and depositors at no probable expense to the public .
Alternatively ;
2 ) The bondholders voluntarily agree to move a portion of their claims lower down in the capital structure , swapping debt for equity ( preferred or common ) , allowing the bank to have a larger cushion of Tier - 1 capital , avoiding insolvency , and hopefully allowing the bank to recover by its own bootstraps , preferably assisted by debt restructuring on the borrower side ( via property appreciation rights and the like ) .
Similar debt / equity swaps would be an appropriate strategy toward failing U.S. automakers as well .
No confidence
This week , the Treasury is expected to take another shot at announcing a toxic assets plan , which regardless of short - term market response , is likely to be met with a terrific vote of no-confidence .
Why ?
Because the only point in buying up a toxic mortgage security is if you can restructure it , which requires that you buy up every tranche having a claim to the underlying mortgages .
These mortgage securities are a lot like a stack of sponges .
If you pour water down , the top tranches absorb it first , and then the next , and so on .
Banks do n't want to let go of the better pieces ( the tranches that pay out first ) , and nobody wants to buy the bottom ones because there 's simply no point unless you can restructure the mortgage obligations so that there 's a probable return of capital .
As I 've said before , the U.S. currently has a private debt to GDP ratio of about 3.5 , which is nearly double the historical norm , at a time when the underlying collateral is being marked down easily by 20 - 30 % .
That implies total collateral losses of 70 - 100 % of GDP ; a figure that includes not only mortgage debt in the banking system , but consumer credit , corporate debt and so on .
The holders are not just banks , but insurance companies , pension funds , foreign lenders , and others .
Even so , there is no way to prevent huge , ongoing losses , because the cash flows off of these assets are not sufficient to service the debt .
The only question is whether the bondholders appropriately bear those losses , or whether the public bears them inappropriately .
A continued policy of protecting all of these bondholders would eventually require U.S. citizens to be put on the hook for something on the order of $ 10 - 14 trillion .
We are nowhere near the end of this process .
We simply cannot make these bad investments whole unless we are willing to hand the next 10 - 20 years of U.S. private savings over to the bondholders who financed reckless lending .
Those bondholders should , and ultimately must , take a portion of these losses , and debt obligations will have to be restructured .
Wall Street has become a bunch of Tooter Turtles crying " Help , Mr. Wizard ! " because it got so used to Greenspan bailing everybody out .
But that constant attempt to avoid inevitable private market losses is what allowed this problem to become so noxious .
It will continue to do so until we collectively scream loud enough for Congress to say on our behalf , " Enough . "
The sideshow about bonuses at AIG simply underscores how little these bailouts have altered the fundamental behavior of people throwing around other people 's money with nothing at risk themselves .
The bondholders of poorly run financial companies should lose because they deserve to lose .
The American public does not .
Speaking of " other people 's money " and conflicts of interest , the first step toward better public policy is to bar the unelected bureaucrats conducting these bailouts from any future employment by companies that benefit from their actions .
Call me cynical .
A comment on inflation
It bears repeating that ultimately , inflation is not driven by monetary expansion per se , but by growth of government spending , regardless of how it is financed .
Inflation basically measures the percentage change in the ratio of two " marginal utilities " : the marginal utility of real goods and services divided by the marginal utility ( mostly for portfolio and transactions purposes ) of government liabilities .
Think ice cream cones - the first one has a very high marginal utility , but the second one you eat has a little less , and so on .
So increased supply tends to depress marginal utility , while scarcity raises it .
Rapid expansion in government liabilities , whether in the form of money or Treasury debt , depresses their marginal utility in relation to that of goods and services , driving inflation higher .
Frantic safe - haven demand for currency and Treasury debt , as we 've seen lately , increases the marginal utility of government liabilities and clearly depresses inflation .
Scarcity of goods and services in relation to their demand raises the marginal utility of goods and services relative to that of government liabilities and is therefore inflationary .
A glut of goods and services in relation to their demand lowers the marginal utility of goods and services and is therefore deflationary .
The reason we 're not seeing inflation here and now is that despite a near doubling in the monetary base , we 've seen a buildup in goods inventories combined with a surge in safe - haven demand for government liabilities .
So investors have absorbed the increased supply of government liabilities without a collapse in their marginal utility .
This will not persist indefinitely , so unfortunately , any nascent economic recovery in the next couple of years will be against the headwinds of both Alt - A mortgage defaults ( coming to your neighborhood in 2010 ) , and inflationary pressures as soon as safe haven demand for Treasuries eases back even moderately .
Milton Friedman was mostly right about inflation - inflation may be a monetary phenomenon , but only because governments ultimately can't help but monetize huge amounts of spending ( as the Fed is doing now ) .
He was entirely right about fiscal discipline - " the burden of government is not measured by how much it taxes , but by how much it spends . "
Market Climate
As of last week , the Market Climate for stocks was characterized by moderately , though not extraordinarily favorable valuations , and unfavorable market action .
The Strategic Growth Fund remains tightly hedged here , and the day - to - day returns of the Fund continue to reflect the difference in performance between the stocks owned by the Fund and the indices we use to hedge .
The advance of the past couple of weeks has been very characteristic of the " fast , furious , prone - to - failure " advances that tend to clear oversold conditions .
Unfortunately , these advances are hardly predictable , since the market can persist for some time in an oversold condition that simply becomes more deeply oversold .
At present , there is only a moderate " investment " merit for accepting market risk here , and very little " speculative " merit given unfavorable market action that has also cleared the prior oversold condition .
That does n't mean that stocks can't advance further , and it's impossible to rule out potential enthusiasm that the Treasury " public - private partnership " idea might engender .
But the relentless failure to properly respond to this crisis has increased the probable duration of the economic downturn , deepened the likely extent of job losses and deleveraging , and has lowered the expected level of future profit margins , all which erode the fundamental value of U.S. companies .
Meanwhile , with the market no longer deeply compressed , there is less pressure for a rebound on the basis of easing risk aversion .
In all , I view the general market 's condition somewhat less favorably than when we first observed these levels last year .
Too much has gone wrong in factors that will have persistent effects , and having consolidated the losses , prices are not nearly as compressed as they were then .
It is very true that the market tends to bottom when the economic news is still poor , but the economic difficulties here are well outside the norm , and we should at least allow for valuation extremes that are similarly outside of the norm .
In bonds , the Market Climate last week was characterized by unfavorable yield levels and moderately favorable yield pressures .
Treasury inflation protected securities , precious metals shares , and foreign currencies all advanced sharply following the Fed 's announcement last week , which benefited the Strategic Total Return Fund .
Note that the inflation compensation in TIPS accrues as an increment to face , not as a distribution , so it does not appear as a component to current yield .
Income distributions of the Fund ( as with all mutual funds ) are also net of expenses .
As a result , the income distributions of the Fund are not closely indicative of the coupon yields of the securities held by the Fund , and certainly not of the inflation compensation from the TIPS .
The Fund remains largely invested in TIPS , with about 30 % of assets allocated across precious metals shares , foreign currencies , and a modest exposure to utility shares .

Douglas Alexander has told the BBC he remains " pretty optimistic " about Labour 's chances at the next general election despite continuing poor polls .
The international development secretary is in charge of planning his party 's campaign for the election .
He denied that the G20 summit was the last chance to avoid a " hammering " and said the recession " had changed the rules of the game " .
A YouGov poll for the Sunday Times suggests the Tories have a 10 % lead .
But Mr Alexander told The Andrew Marr Show on BBC
One that the polls were " very volatile " at the moment .
He said the UK was in " uncharted waters " and said there were opportunities for " centre left parties like Labour to say there are limits to markets and that markets need morals " .
' Last chance '
He said he believed Labour had a " compass " for the way ahead while the Conservatives did not " have the solutions the country needs " .
He said that was why " ultimately I 'm pretty optimistic despite the challenges we face " .
Mr Alexander was speaking as the latest opinion poll suggested Conservative support stood at 41 % , with Labour on 31 % and the Lib Dems on 17 % .
The YouGov poll - for which 1,840 British adults were interviewed on March 12 and 13 - also suggests 59 % of voters believe David Cameron is doing a good job as Conservative leader compared with 35 % who believe Gordon Brown is doing a good job as prime minister .
A general election can be called by Mr Brown at any time up to June 2010 .
Most expect the election to be held in spring 2010 , but there have been persistent suggestions that a successful G20 summit at the start of April could lead to Mr Brown deciding to call an election in May - or to coincide with the European elections - in June this year .
It was put to Mr Alexander that the G20 was Labour 's " last hope of not being hammered " .
But he brushed that off , saying that the G20 summit mattered because of what it can do to help the UK and global economies .
Apology
He said that a similar summit in 1931 had failed to reach agreement on international action " and we all know what happened " afterwards , referring to the spread of protectionism and the depression of the 1930s .
On Friday Conservative leader David Cameron , whose party has been calling on Mr Brown to apologise for policy failures over debt and bank regulation , said he was sorry for mistakes his party had made in the years before the credit crunch .
He said he did not think the Conservatives did enough to warn about the rising levels of corporate debt , banking debt and borrowing from abroad and said there were other areas of economic policy where " we would have done it differently if we had our time again " .
Mr Cameron said Mr Brown was unable to make a " clean break " with the past because he was " in denial " .
He said Mr Brown believed " a fundamentally sound economy has been hit by an external financial juggernaut , that Britain is just the innocent victim of a banking crisis that ' came from America ' " .

Sorry , is this Fox News claiming the far - left “ demonizes ” people on the far - right ?
Yes , the network guilty of employing conservatives for this very purpose ( against liberals ) walks blindly into oncoming traffic with this debate , sparked by Rep. Barney Frank calling Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia a homophobe .
WHICH HE IS .
Resident bigot Sean Hannity refers to Scalia as one of most “ brilliant jurists of all time , absolutely . ”
And the bandwagoners on the network think describing Scalia as a “ homophobe ” is just too harsh .
Nevermind that his own court opinions , writings , dialogue , and signals of support have made his bigotry infamous and clear .
Thanks to Pastafarian Ricardo for spotting this FSM sighting in the opening credits of the Futurama movie Beyond the Wild Green Yonder .
Here ’s a video :
Sorry , the video is no longer available .

This is to notify you that we have removed or disabled access to the following material as a result of a third - party notification by Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation claiming that this material is infringing : FSM sighting on Futurama : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0zNc0ufNuc
Retarded .
Suck it , Fox .
Anyway …
Some of us suspected there were Pastafarians at the Futurama camp after the release of Beast with a Billion Backs .
Pastafarian Piscu makes the argument better than I can :
God is noodly God is noodly
Heaven Heaven
Bender , the Pirate Bender , the Pirate
Warning – Spoilers :
First , consider this : the most popular character in Futurama is surely Bender .
So , it is reasonable to state that , if the writers and creators of Futurama want to express some of their beliefs , they will clearly do it via the robot itself .
About Bender , we already know that he is a great beer drinker and uses to indulge himself with “ hookerbots ” , which are the robotic version of strippers .
These are obviosly references to our Paradise , its beer volcano and strippers factory .
But in The Beast with a Billion Backs , Bender ’s faith is made much more clear .
In fact , near the end of the movie , we see him dressed like a pirate and leading a ship of pirate robots ( screen cap attached ) !
This is undoubtedly the ultimate evidence of the fatc that even the Futurama people are part of our Church !
But there ’s even more !
The reason of Bender ’s pirating is an attack to a planet - sized being from another universe , named Yivo , who has taken with him all of the people from our universe , making them fall in love with him .
And the shape of Yivo is what is more surprising ( screen cap attached ) .
In fact , Yivo looks a lot like the FSM , but there are some differences : he is tentacled too , but has only ONE central meatball and ONE eye .
So , he is probably a represantation of a fake god , who pretends to be His Noodleness but actually is n’t !
Furthermore , when we see the “ heaven ” that stands on Yivo ’s surface ( screen cap attached ) , we can notice that it is very similar to the “ classical ” heaven , the one which people usually believe in .
So , what we are able to conclude is that Bender , who is a pirate ( hence , a FSM follower ) engages in a battle against a fake FSM ( Yivo ) to rescue humanity ( he actually states , while fighting the monster , “ I ’m rescuing you ! ” ) from that false paradise , and he finally succedes in his mission .
This is an obvious metaphor of the struggle the FSM Church has to carry on to bring people to the true faith .
Of course , we do n’t intend to move war on any other religion , but the whole story is just representive of the great effort we have to put in our mission .
What do you guys think ?
Bridget Lee came within metaphorical inches to being convicted of murdering her baby .
A baby that was not , in fact , murdered .
It was stillborn .
Alabama authorities plan to review as many as 100 past forensic cases by a medical examiner whose botched autopsy of a baby led a judge to throw out a murder charge against the mother .
Circuit Judge James Moore on Thursday dismissed the case against Bridget Lee , a 34 - year - old church pianist who spent nine months in jail after being charged with her child 's death in 2006 .
An initial autopsy found that the baby was suffocated .
And on that basis Lee , a mentally ill woman who appears to have panicked on giving birth to a dead baby under less than ideal circumstances , was charged with murder .
Lee 's decision to hide her stillborn baby , rather than taking it to a hospital or the police , was foolish indeed .
But worse than foolish was the handling of forensic investigation by medical examiner Corinne Stern .
Dr. Stern turned a case of prenatal pneumonia into strangulation and suffocation .
Evidence during the hearing showed six different forensics experts found the baby died of pneumonia caused by an infection and was stillborn .
What Stern thought were bruises were actually signs of decomposition .
I do n't even play a doctor on tv , but I have enough passing familiarity with the science to venture that , perhaps , the doctor did n't perform a proper autopsy at all .
The judge seems to agree .
The judge said in 30 years of law practice he had never seen an expert make a mistake so bad .
He praised District Attorney Chris McCool for listening to a defense expert who raised the first red flags about the flawed autopsy .
" What has happened in this courtroom today is absolutely unprecedented , " said [ Alabama Circuit Judge James ] Moore .
One hopes that Judge Moore is referring to the autopsy , rather than the prosecutor 's decision to to re-examine the evidence and drop the charges , but in either case , it was commendable on the part of McCool .
Now , will prosecutors in the other Alabama cases on which Dr. Stern worked be so open - minded , or will they treat them as do their neighbors in Mississippi ?

Investigators at the Burnham Institute for Medical Research ( Burnham ) have developed a protocol to rapidly differentiate human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) into neural progenitor cells that may be ideal for transplantation .
The research , conducted by Alexei Terskikh , Ph.D. , and colleagues , outlines a method to create these committed neural precursor cells ( C - NPCs ) that is replicable , does not produce mutations in the cells and could be useful for clinical applications .
The research was published on March 13 in the journal Cell Death and Differentiation .
When the C - NPCs created using the Terskikh protocol were transplanted into mice , they became active neurons and integrated into the cortex and olfactory bulb .
The transplanted cells did not generate tumor outgrowth .
" The uniform conversion of embryonic stem cells into neural progenitors is the first step in the development of cell - based therapies for neurodegenerative disorders or spinal injuries , " said Dr. Terskikh .
" Many of the methods used to generate neural precursor cells for research in the lab would never work in therapeutic applications .
This protocol is very well suited for clinical application because it is robust , controllable and reproducible . "
Dr. Terskikh notes that the extensive passaging ( moving cells from plate to plate ) required by some protocols to expand the numbers of neural precursor cells limits the plasticity of the cells , can introduce mutations and may lead to the expression of oncogenes .
The Terskikh protocol avoids this by using efficient conversion of hESCs into primary neuroepithelial cells without the extensive passaging .
The scientists were able to rapidly neuralize the hESCs by culturing them in small clusters in a liquid suspension .
The cells developed the characteristic " rosettes " seen in neuroepithelial cells .
The C - NPCs were then cultured in monolayers .
Immunochemical and RT - PCR analysis of the cells demonstrated that they were uniformly C - NPCs .
Whole - genome analysis confirmed this finding .
Immunostaining and imaging showed that the cells could be differentiated into three distinct types of neural cells .
The team then demonstrated that the C - NPCs differentiated into neurons after transplantation into the brains of neonatal mice .
This research received funding from the National Institutes of Health and the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine .

Ah , the joys of the Randian free market !
Go through the motions , use someone who does n't know what they 're doing , and make sure the plant has plenty of notice for the inspection .
Why , it 's a veritable recipe for disaster :
When food industry giants like Kellogg want to ensure that American consumers are being protected from contaminated products , they rely on private inspectors like Eugene A. Hatfield .
So last spring Mr. Hatfield headed to the Peanut Corporation of America plant in southwest Georgia to make sure its chopped nuts , paste and peanut butter were safe to use in everything from granola bars to ice cream .
The peanut company , though , knew in advance that Mr. Hatfield was coming .
He had less than a day to check the entire plant , which processed several million pounds of peanuts a month .
Mr. Hatfield , 66 , an expert in fresh produce , was not aware that peanuts were readily susceptible to salmonella poisoning — which he was not required to test for anyway .
And while Mr. Hatfield was inspecting the plant on behalf of Kellogg and other food companies , the Peanut Corporation was paying him for his efforts .
“ The overall food safety level of this facility was considered to be : SUPERIOR , ” he concluded in his March 27 , 2008 , report for his employer , the American Institute of Baking , which performs audits for major food companies .
A copy of the audit was obtained by The New York Times .
Federal investigators later discovered that the dilapidated plant was ravaged by salmonella and had been shipping tainted peanuts and paste for at least nine months .
But they were too late to prevent what has become one of the nation ’s worst known outbreaks of food - borne disease in recent years , in which nine are believed to have died and an estimated 22,500 were sickened .
It looks like sagging may make a comeback in one Florida town .
On Wednesday , a Florida Court decided that Riviera Beach ’s ordinance prohibiting sagging pants is unconstitutional .
According to The Palm Beach Post , Judge Laura Johnson ruled that regardless of “ how tacky or distasteful ” fashion is , it ’s protected under the 14th amendment .
Though the origin of sagging is n’t known , it first became fashionable in hop - hop culture and has since become a mainstream fad .
In fact , there are even websites that celebrate sagging style .
The law , which was approved by over 72 % of Riviera Beach residents in January of 2008 , carried a fine of $ 150 or community service for first offenses .
In my Emerald column last week , I stood up for saggers , writing :
“ Take a jog down any American beach – regardless of the city – and you ’ll likely have the misfortune of seeing an old guy in a Speedo or worse , but that ’s the consequence of living in a free society .
The idea that the law needs to step in and prohibit dress it finds offensive is a boneheaded and arrogant philosophy of civic governing .
It also sets a dangerous precedent for further restrictions on individual expression . ”
It appears the Court has wisely taken my advice to heart .
However .
Riviera Beach Mayor Thomas Masters , the brain trust behind the ban is determined to carry on his crusade .
In fact , he shook of the ruling , saying that laws that break ground are “ all ruled unconstitutional at first . ”
Yes , he really did say that .
City attorney Matthew Russell defended the law by citing concerns by cops that stockpiles of weapons could be hidden in the pants and it now now appears that Russell and Masters will appeal the ruling to a higher court , setting up a high drama sagging showdown .
I ’m glad to know that in a nation with a struggling economy , a health care crisis and an abundance of crime , there are two public servants so ardently committed to pursuing the most ridiculous policy in the world .
Does anyone dare to disagree ?
It has served important roles in worship , it has been used for medicinal purposes , and it has been used for its pure ability to help people let loose and have a good time .
Yes , alcohol tells us a fascinating story , that of the relationship between societies and alcohol , and how they have evolved together , through time ...
Ancient Period
From what historians have gathered , alcohol was first used over ten thousand years ago .
Though its exact use at the time is unknown , the discovery of beer jugs dating back to the late Stone Age provides evidence that fermented beverages have existed as early as the Neolithic period .
It has even been suggested that beer may have preceded bread as a staple .
Better than sliced bread ?
Guess so .
The Ancient Egyptians were master brewers and believed that alcoholic beverages were symbolic , necessary for the worshiping of Osiris , the Egyptians ' god of wine , and also the inventor of beer .
Both wine and beer were offered to gods and the Ancient Egyptians had over 17 varieties of beer and at least 24 varieties of wine .
In ancient Chinese societies , drinking was also used as a source of inspiration and worship , however , these societies demonstrate that excessive drinking and abuse did exist .
There were laws that prohibited the making of wine , but these laws were just as quickly repealed as they were enacted .
The Ancient Greeks were among the most moderate drinkers of any ancient civilization and had many rules that stressed temperate drinking .
Except of course the cult of Dinoysus -- who believed that being inebriated brought one closer to the deity ; they were n't so temperate with the boozing , but that was because it was part of their religion .
( Sign me up . )
The Roman Empire
Though Rome started off quite like the Ancient Greek civilization in its appreciation and respect for drinking in moderation , after the Roman conquest of the Mediterranean basin , all hell broke loose .
" The traditional Roman values of temperance , frugality and simplicity were gradually replaced by heavy drinking , ambition , degeneracy and corruption . "
Wine was their poison and excessive drinking and getting debauched became acceptable and encouraged .
Romans would indulge in practices such as drinking on an empty stomach to make the effects quicker , or making themselves throw - up to give themselves more room for food and wine .
First Drinking Games
The Romans loved drinking so much they were the first to come up with drinking games .
One of them involved throwing a dice and having to rapidly consume as many cups as the number on the face of the dice rolled .
The Middle Ages and The Black Death
Throughout France , Spain and Italy in the Middle Ages , wine was the predominant alcoholic beverage and monasteries were the main producers .
One of the most important developments to the uses of alcohol was the development of distillation .
Monks were the first to experiment with this process and soon after physicians and alchemists , developed it is as a cure for ailments .
The Black Death began mid-fourteenth century , sweeping out 82 % of the population .
Subsequently , a lot of people began to seriously question their faith .
Alcohol was used to try and escape thoughts of inevitable death but some also believed that drinking alcohol protected them from this mysterious disease .
Alcohol consumption was high in this period .
The Modern Age
The Modern Age was characterized by large - scale changes : colonization , trade , the building of modern cities , rationality and science taking over as new ways of thinking .
In the sixteenth century , alcohol consumption was high , particularly the consumption of beer .
Polish peasants consumed up to three liters of beer per day .
English sailors received a ration of a gallon of beer per day and soldiers , two - thirds of a gallon .
In Denmark , adult laborers and sailors would drink about a gallon of beer per day .
Distilled alcohol and spirit drinking was mostly used for medicinal purposes at this time .
Sparkling champagne was introduced in the seventeenth century , developed primarily by Dom Perignon around 1668 .
He invented a cork that could contain bubbles , and stronger bottles that would n't burst .
However it would take another century or so before fully mastering the technique to prevent bursting bottles , but once they had it figured out , sparkling champagne became very popular .
The eighteenth century was full of contradictions .
Though society embraced " rational mastery of self " , moderation and the negative effects of drunkenness , this period also reflected the emergence of a more self - indulgent society and the increase of spirit drinking .
Spirits were made cheap and made readily available to the public , even though there was a negative stigma attached to drunkenness .
The consumption of gin in 1685 was over one - half million gallons and only eleven years later in the London area alone , more than eleven million gallons of gin were produced .
This , coupled with increasing poverty in London is said to have onset the so - called Gin-Epidemic .
In 1736 , Parliament passed legislation to discourage consumption .
However , seven years later , gin consumption reached its peak " when the nation of six and one - half million people drank over 18 million gallons of gin .
And most was consumed by the small minority of the population then living in London and other cities ; people in the countryside largely remained loyal to beer , ale and cider " .
By the nineteenth century , the onset of the industrial revolution , alcohol consumption posed a direct threat to productivity and was blamed for social problems , poverty , increased crime rates , and moral and religious conflicts .
The rapid growth and overcrowding of urban cities went overlooked as the major factor leading to these problems .
Eventually groups were formed to try and abolish the distribution and consumption of alcohol .

The Prohibition
From 1913 - 1933 the sale , manufacture and transportation of alcohol for consumption was prohibited in the United States as mandated in the Eighteenth Amendment .
The Ku Klux Klan strongly supported the cause , believing that it would help improve society .
However , illegal distribution and production of liquor was rampant and prohibition became extremely unpopular during the Great Depression .
By 1933 , Franklin Roosevelt signed the Cullen - Harrison
Act which allowed the manufacture and sale of certain alcohol beverages and by December 5 , 1933 the Twenty - first Amendment repealed the Eighteenth Amendment .
BitTorrent 's user base is growing month by month and has reached a level where reputable marketing research companies have started to look into the phenomenon .
Over the years Nielsen Media has optimized their ratings system for television , radio and films - but on the other hand their BitTorrent traffic estimates are far from accurate .
Nielsen , one of the largest market research companies worldwide is probably best known for their TV - show ratings in the US .
However , they ’re also looking into less old fashioned media outlets such as BitTorrent .
Most recently , they say they have found an interesting trend in Australia .
“ Total visits by Australians to BitTorrent websites including Mininova , The Pirate Bay , isoHunt , TorrentReactor and Torrentz grew from 785,000 in April last year to 1,049,000 in April this year , Nielsen says .
This is a year - on - year increase of 33.6 percent , ” The Age wrote a few days ago .
This may sound like a lot of traffic , but since Nielsen reports the number of visits and not the unique visitors we expected it to be much higher .
Luckily , Mininova was kind enough to give us some insight into their statistics so we could check how accurate Nielsen ’s estimates are .
The results are quite a shock .
When we look at the statistics of Mininova alone , we see that the site had 6,268,969 Aussie visits in April and a massive 33,162,846 Aussie page views .
Compared to the same month in 2008 ( 4,144,556 visits ) , this is an increase of more than 50 percent .
So , the Australian visitors to Mininova alone are already 600 % higher than Nielsen ’s estimates of the total traffic to Mininova , The Pirate Bay , isoHunt , TorrentReactor and Torrentz .
Unfortunately we do n’t have any details on the methodology or sample Nielsen used , but it ’s certainly not very representative .
Perhaps even more worrying , The Age attributes the surge in traffic to the economic downturn , without providing any evidence for a causal relationship between the two events .
Over the past 5 years most BitTorrent sites have seen huge traffic increases every year , also when the economy was in an upswing .
Even more so , the money generated by ( legal and illegal ) use of BitTorrent and other file - sharing networks is greater than the combined revenue of the various entertainment industry bodies who try to stop piracy .
One could argue that without piracy the whole economy would collapse .
The downloading itself is not so much about cost saving .
In Australia , BitTorrent is especially popular among those who want to catch up with US television shows that appear months or years later on TV down under .
Money is not so much of an issue for them , they simply want to see the latest Lost or Heroes episodes .
In 1994 , Congress jammed a batch of foreign books and movies back into the copyright closet .
They had previously fallen into the public domain for a variety of technical reasons ( the author had n't renewed the rights with the US Copyright Office , the authors of older works had n't included a copyright notice , etc. ) and companies and individuals had already started reusing the newly public works .
Did Congress have the right to put a stop to this activity by shoving the works back into copyright ?
On Friday , a federal court said no .
" Traditional contours of copyright "
1994 's Uruguay Round Agreements Act ( URAA ) brought US intellectual property law in line with that of other countries .
Section 514 of URAA better aligned US copyright law with the international Berne Convention , one of the earliest international intellectual property treaties .
Though Berne had first been signed back in 1886 , the US had n't joined up until a century later , in 1988 .
Part of Berne requires countries to honor copyright on foreign works , so long as those works remain protected in their country of origin .
Before URAA was passed , foreign works still received copyright protection in the US , but only on US terms .
This meant that works began to leave copyright and enter the public domain in the US even though some were still granted copyright protection in their home countries .
After signing URAA , these works reverted into copyright in the US .
Lawrence Lessig and a team from Stanford have been arguing for years in Golan v. Gonzales ( now Golan v. Holder ) that Congress overstepped its authority when it did this .
A federal court disagreed and issued a summary judgment against Golan , a music teacher who had been freely using Prokofiev sheet music before it reverted back into copyright .
But the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals said back in 2007 that the case should be reconsidered on First Amendment grounds .
Last week , the federal judge who oversaw the trial changed his ruling and agreed that URAA violated the First Amendment .
How ?
In another famous copyright case also argued by Lessig ( Eldred v. Ashcroft ) , the Supreme Court had found that Congressional copyright action could be overturned if it " altered the traditional contours of copyright protection . "
Lessig seized on this phrase , arguing that putting public domain works back under copyright was unprecedented in US law .
The Tenth Circuit generally agreed , which meant that the justices opened the door to a review of URAA 's legality on First Amendment grounds .
" Together , the public in general and these plaintiffs in particular have a First Amendment interest in using works in the public domain , " noted the court in 2007 .
" In reliance on their rights to these works , plaintiffs have already performed or planned future performances and used these publicly available works to create their own artistic productions .
By removing works in the public domain , [ URAA ] arguably hampers free expression and undermines the values the public domain is designed to protect . "
In the new ruling , Judge Lewis Babcock conducted his First Amendment analysis and concluded that URAA did change the " traditional contours of copyright " in one important sense : it meant that the copyright sequence no longer moves only from protection to public domain .
Indeed , at the whim of Congress , public domain works can now migrate into copyright .
" Such an alteration is inconsistent with the copyright scheme as designed by the Framers and as implemented by Congress in the ensuing years , " wrote Babcock .
Sweet vindication
Anthony Falzone , who heads up the Fair Use Project at Stanford and has been involved in the case , called it a " big deal " because " it is the first time a court has held any part of the Copyright Act violates the First Amendment and the first time any court has placed specific constitutional limits on the government 's ability to erode the public domain . "
Lawrence Lessig , was just as pleased , saying that he was " very happy and very very proud to report a big victory " in the case .
Lessig titled his statement , " From the there 's - no - way - in - hell - you 'll - win - that - one department , " a phrase he must have heard many time since taking the case .
( He came in for similar criticism for the Eldred case , especially after losing at the Supreme Court . )
While further appeals are likely in such a prominent case , Lessig & Co. can at least take some momentary comfort from confounding the naysayers and finding the edge of Congressional authority to tinker with copyrights .
Nokia N900 Rover Internet Tablet details leak
Details of Nokia ’s next - gen Internet Tablet have leaked , suggesting that the Finnish company have moved away from positioning the platform as a companion device and now perceive it more as a smartphone .
According to leaked specifications , the Nokia N900 or “ Nokia Rover ” now has quadband GSM and 3G HSPA , in addition to the WiFi and Bluetooth of the previous - gen models .
It also sheds some screen - size , scaling down to a 3.5 - inch 800 x 480 touchscreen ( from 4 - inches ) though as this leaked image suggests the overall design is very similar to that of the N810 .
Storage is believed to be 32GB , with a memory card slot for boosting that up to 48GB , and there ’s 1GB of total virtual runtime memory made up to 256MB physical RAM and 768 MB of virtual memory .
There appears to be a front - facing camera , likely for video calls , together with a 5 - megapixel autofocus camera with flash and Carl Zeiss optics on the back .
The new CPU is an OMAP3430 500/600M
Hz chip , runs the new Maemo 5 OS , and the whole thing measures 59.7 x 111 x 18.2 mm .
Nokia ’s “ target launch dates ” ( as of the beginning of 2009 ) are a July 2009 release on T - Mobile International , together with the Middle East , Asia and Sout - East Asia - Pacific , followed by a T - Mobile USA release in August / September 2009 , and Europe in October 2009 .
As the Internet Tablet now has integrated cellular , it ’s likely to be carrier - subsidized ; that could go some way to offsetting the high sticker price which many criticized on the previous models .

Hello everyone , First of all , I 'm not Islamic , or middle eastern , I 'm christian and an American .
I 'm putting these videos up to try to reach people because I would love to have the victims of this crime see real justice .
Any honest study of the events of 9/11 shows that it was an inside job .
If you can't see it or can't accept the evidence then I 'm sorry for you , but I 'm not responsible for dragging you kicking and screaming towards the truth .
So do n't expect me to argue with you .
I want to enjoy life , not waste my time arguing .
I work full - time for a living and do n't need more problems .
Besides if you are happy in ignorance I 'm not going to try to bum you out .
My hope is that there are honest people out there who are curious to see the truth and will find these videos useful .

MADRID - A Spanish judge on Wednesday opened an investigation into an alleged " systematic programme " of torture at the US Guantanamo Bay detention camp , following accusations by four former prisoners .
Judge Baltasar Garzon will probe the " perpetrators , the instigators , the necessary collaborators and accomplices " to crimes of torture at the prison at the US naval base in southern Cuba , he said in his ruling , a copy of which was seen by AFP .
The judge based his decision on statements by Hamed Abderrahman Ahmed , known as the " Spanish Taliban " and three other former Guantanamo detainees -- a Moroccan , a Palestinian and a Libyan .
Garzon said that documents declassified by the US administration and carried by US media " have revealed what was previously a suspicion : the existence of an authorised and systematic programme of torture and mistreatment of persons deprived of their freedom " that flouts international conventions .
This points to " the possible existence of concerted actions by the US administration for the execution of a multitude of crimes of torture against persons deprived of their freedom in Guantanamo and other prisons including that of Bagram " in Afghanistan .
The four former Guantanamo detainees alleged they were held in cramped cells and suffered beatings and other physical and mental mistreatment .
The Palestinian , Jamiel Abdelatif al Banna , said he suffered " blows to the head that caused him to lose consciousness , was detained in an underground place without light for three weeks and deprived of food and sleep . "

The decision by Garzon , known around the world for ordering the arrest of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in London in 1998 , was unrelated to another investigation by the judge into six officials of the former US administration of George W. Bush over alleged torture at Guantanamo Bay .
Prosecutors this month issued an official request to the judge to drop that probe , arguing that the complaint targets officials who did not have the power to make decisions but who simply " drafted non-binding judicial reports . "
Spain since 2005 has assumed the principle of universal jurisdiction in alleged cases of crimes against humanity , genocide , and terrorism .
But it can only proceed when any such cases of the alleged crimes are not already subject to a legal procedure in the country involved .
Several human rights groups have asked judges in different countries to indict Bush administration officials over the camp , which US President Barack Obama has vowed to close by January 2010 .
More than 800 detainees have been held at the US military prison since 2002 .
Some 240 people are still there .
About 60 of them have been deemed eligible for release , but the Obama administration is struggling to arrange their transfer to a third country .
The Bush administration had charged about 20 of the detainees on terror - related charges , including two prisoners arrested when they were still teenagers .

He was 54 .
So i say these are ink , and they do look like ink but there actually food colouring / dye , they give the same effect pretty much , but i wanted to give them a watered down feel with strong pieces of colour in some places and lighter in others .
Dont forget to keep checking Texture Lovers for free textures .
These 20 textures are also at a high resolution to cover most working areas and are ideal to be edited , such as colour adjustmets and cropping , as you can see i have changed the colour in the preview above to green .

You might remember a time when everyone — from telco giants to corner coffee shops — was furiously serving up Wi-Fi .
McDonald 's became an Internet café , and dozens of municipalities nationwide were racing to set up open hot spots .
Your broadband connection was about to be as portable as your cell phone .
That was like five years ago .
What happened next ?
Zilch .
" There has been a complete lack of leadership from the regulatory agencies , service providers , and device makers , " says Ashvin Vellody , senior vice president for enabling technologies at communications research firm Yankee Group .
Fortunately , cellular providers are stepping up to fill the motivational vacuum .
Omnipresent broadband access is almost here .
Again .
Really .
Even skeptics have to concede that the odds look pretty good this time .
The technology wo n't be your familiar 802.11 — it never had the bandwidth or range to be viable anyway .
The airwaves will instead be paved with a new generation of wireless broadband .
Some of these so - called 4G networks will use the 700 - MHz spectrum that the government auctioned off last year , and they promise to blanket every medium to large city in Net - ready radio waves .
It 's about time .
Cell phone companies have been asleep at the wheel for years , loath to upgrade to expensive new networks when their old ones " work just fine . "
The iPhone slapped them awake .
Before Apple 's smooth - talker , portable broadband did n't look juicy enough to chase — cellular data usage was slim .
But the typical iPhone owner uses five times more data than the average cell user .
" It took Apple and its ecosystem of apps and interactivity to prove the pent - up demand for ubiquitous broadband , " Vellody says .
And now , mobile devices like netbooks and Google phones have joined in to force the issue .
Clearwire introduced a WiMax service in Baltimore and Portland , Oregon , with a commitment to add 80 more markets by the end of 2010 .
Verizon is testing a related technology , Long Term Evolution , and aims to roll out coverage by 2010 ; Motorola , Sony Ericsson , and Nokia are all building compatible devices .
Both WiMax and LTE will offer about the same DSL - ish speed ( 5 - 6 Mbps ) , but bitrates could grow to 15 Mbps by 2012 .
Unfortunately , the current economic malaise is slowing some capital expansion plans .
( How convenient . )
" It wo n't be overnight , but you 're eventually going to see mobile broadband replace your at - home connection , " says Barry West , Clearwire 's president and chief architect .
A bright forecast — but believe it when you actually see the sun .

After banning and then publicizing the most controversial interrogation practices employed by the CIA , President Obama called on the agency Monday to live up to its mission under its new marching orders .
Obama called the CIA “ an indispensable tool , the tip of the spear ” in national security as he addressed its employees while standing before a marble wall with 89 stars representing , anonymously , agents who have died in the line of duty .
“ We live in dangerous times , ” Obama said at the CIA headquarters in Virginia .
“ I am going to need you more than ever . ”
Obama last week released legal memos written by the Bush - era Justice Department that gave the CIA authority to use harsh interrogation tactics on Al Qaeda suspects -- including waterboarding , in which drowning is simulated .
Advertisement
The release of the memos has drawn criticism from some current and former intelligence officials and Bush administration officials .
Former Vice President Dick Cheney has continued to defend waterboarding and other banned tactics .
He demanded the declassification of the results of the interrogations to prove the value of the techniques .
However , Atty .
Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. has called waterboarding “ torture . ”
Along with other methods , it is forbidden under orders Obama signed in his first week in office .
“ I have put an end to the interrogation techniques described in those memos , ” Obama said Monday .
“ I believe that our nation is stronger and more secure when we deploy the full measure of both our power and the power of our values -- including the rule of law . ”
Advertisement
CIA Director Leon E. Panetta drove the same message home : “ We can fully protect our nation and our values at the same time , ” he said Monday .
The White House sought to show that it is leaving the past behind by announcing that no CIA agents would be prosecuted for interrogations sanctioned under the Bush administration .
Obama ’s advisors also have suggested that the highest - level officials who authorized the practices will be immune .
But the White House came under new pressure Monday to leave open the possibility of prosecutions .
Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) , chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , asked Obama in a letter that pledges of immunity “ be held in reserve ” until her committee had completed an investigation .
Advertisement
The panel is expected to review thousands of classified CIA cables and other materials describing the interrogations of self - proclaimed Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and others .
Feinstein said the review would take eight months .
The released Justice Department memos show that the CIA waterboarded Mohammed 183 times in 2003 .
Another suspected senior Al Qaeda operative known as Abu Zubaydah was waterboarded 83 times that same year .
The numbers are far higher than any previously reported , raising questions about the effectiveness of the method .
But Cheney maintained that the techniques were crucial to national security .
In a FOX News interview , he said : “ I know specifically of reports that I read , that I saw , that lay out what we learned through the interrogation process and what the consequences were for the country . ”

Obama acknowledged the widespread criticism , but the White House maintains that much of what was disclosed had been known and written about .

Greg Miller in the Washington bureau contributed to this report .
German security researchers at the Honeynet Project have scored a major breakthrough in studying the behavior of the Conficker / Downadup worm .
According to reports , there now may be a way to detect the malware on infected networks .
Security researchers , with the help of Dan Kaminsky and Rich Mogull , have the ability to remotely and anonymously detect Conficker infections .
Kaminsky explained that since the Conficker / Downadup malware changes the way Windows looks on a network , it is possible to scan a network and have it " respond " whether or not it is or is not infected with Conficker .
Malware Tries to Patch its own Exploited Flaw
Tillmann Werner and Felix Leder , two German researchers from the Honeynet Project , figured out that the malware tries to patch the same security flaw ( MS08 - 067 ) that it previously exploited .
The binary patch NetpwPathCanonicalize( ) -- used by the Conficker / Downadup worm -- works quite a bit differently , meaning that network scanners are able to pinpoint the existence of the malware .
( Source : zdnet.com )
The Honeynet Project released a proof of concept scanner that contains tools and information on containing the Conficker / Downadup worm .
( Source : uni-bonn.de )
Enterprise - class scanners from Tenable , McAfee , Nmap , Ncircle and Qualys are also available .
Do n't Fear The Reaper , or April 1st
On April 1st , the Conficker / Downadup malware is programmed to generate thousands of domain names a day , but that does not mean that the world is going to end or that computers will self - destruct .
As noted by ZDNet , you should n't fear the worm 's activation date because Conficker can already receive updates ; therefore , focusing on the April 1st detonation date is misguided .
Some of the best security researchers in the world are working diligently to mitigate the domain issue .
50,000 domains are being closely monitored , so if any malicious server appears , it will most likely be rendered useless .
The author(s ) of the malware probably wo n't do anything on the one day everyone 's watching -- in other words , the day they might get caught .
An excellent analysis of what the Conficker / Downadup worm is and is n't can be found from SRI International .

Few things in science cause as much public confusion as the Theory of Evolution .
While a number of great resources have already effectively elucidated the concept , including a video I ’ve embedded in this article , I think it is valuable to repeat and expand upon these resources in a public fashion , lest The Theory fall out of common knowledge .
It is a credit to evolution ’s founder , Charles Darwin , that he was correct about so many of the basic tenants in his original publication , The Origin of Species .
These principles can be generally summarized into four statements :
Variation , which arises through mutation , exists within and between populations for every trait .
More individuals are born into a population than can survive ( usually because of the scarcity of resources ) .
Traits are passed down from parents to their offspring .
Individuals most fit to survive in their environment generally do ( Natural Selection ) .
Something many people fail to realize about evolution is that the entire theory pretty much boils down into the aforementioned points .
Much of the controversy that has been held up by various anti-evolution groups centers around points not affecting the theory at all .
In fact , if the concepts of evolution were suddenly found to be false , our understanding of the nature of species would be a very poor one .
Let ’s attempt to identify just what evolution DOES specify and leave be the things not covered by the theory .
First of all , it is helpful to think about individuals of a certain species as free - floating molecules .
In fact , this is pretty much how microbiologists have to view microorganisms , proteins , and other microscopic components of the biological world .
Imagine that these individuals are constantly moving about and encountering food , predators , good environments , and bad environments .
If you zoomed in on any one individual and followed its life , it would represent one possible jagged line .
That individual would also have a specific set of qualities or traits that are the results of its parentage .
Now , zoom out and look at all the individuals in the population .
They all have their own jagged lines that make up their physical movement and interactions as well as their own unique sets of traits .
Many of the individuals will be similar to one another and many may have similar “ lives , ” but when added all together there is an enormous amount of chaos going on in a single population of any sufficient size .
This is NOT evolution , but instead the conditions required for the evolutionary process to occur .
From these conditions it is very easy to visualize the process of natural selection .
Individuals essentially need to survive long enough to reproduce .
Reproduction might only require mitotic division ( as in microbes ) or mating might need to occur ( as in animals ) .
In any event these are the first constraints .
Then individuals face dangers from predators and dangerous situations ( a fish trapped in a draining tide pool or a stag falling off a cliff ) .
Lastly , individuals will compete with themselves and with other species for scarce resources such as food , water , and possibly space ( a major concern of plants ) .
The competition resulting from these conditions rapidly selects a smaller group of individuals who will create the next generation .
This process can be termed “ natural selection ” because conditions chaotically ( not randomly ) , “ select for ” or “ select against ” a given individual .
Note that nowhere in here is “ survival of the fittest ” a stated fact .
Often the fittest do survive because their traits make it more likely , but if a chasm opens up in the earth and only a few individuals survive , then it becomes “ survival of the lucky . ”
However it works , those who survive pass their traits on for another round and the cycle continues .
It is easy to see that over time , perhaps one year or thousands of years , that a such a chaotic population will not become uniform , but will collectively shift toward certain traits .
If the shift is dramatic enough , new species emerge .
Essentially a species is a group of individuals that are related enough to mate .
When a population branches ( which can happen for several reason ) , two groups can diverge and eventually lose the ability to mate .
This is the basis for all speciation .
Regardless of what you have heard , this is really ALL there is to evolution .
I have not spent much time refuting the claims of those who oppose evolution ( despite the enormous amount of evidence in its favor ) , but the following video does an admirable job , so I will let it :
Why is evolution so important ?
Well , if you use evolution as a viewpoint and a tool when examining the world , some things fall into place and others do n’t .
When things make sense with evolution , it ’s a good chance that we can figure out an organism ’s history ( especially with the rise of genomics ) .
When things DON ’T fit , then we need to reexamine the evidence and look for better solutions .
Sometimes knowing the missing pieces of a puzzle are important if we are to understand the bigger picture .
Before we finish , I would like to give myself a tiny bit of credibility as a science writer .
As of Saturday , I now hold a B.S. in Biology ( conc. in Microbiology ) from George Mason University .
While my experience in the field is still limited , much of the theory is still fresh in my head and easy to put down in writing .
Hopefully graduate school at the University of Maryland will help bolster that knowledge .
Then I can pass it on to you , the reader .
Feel free to leave a comment or a question ( I try to answer any reasonable ones ) or hit me up on Twitter !

Last night ( April 2 , 2009 ) at the St. Louis Lambda Lounge I gave a 45 - minute talk on the Factor programming language .
I ’ve uploaded the handout and example code here .
I apologize in advance to anyone in the Factor community who reads it and laughs at my “ newbie ” mistakes and misstatements .
Appistry again provided space and pizza – thanks guys !
( Appistry is our locally - grown but widely - known cloud infrastructure software maker – they ’d been cloudy for years before the term entered wide use . )
The talk appeared to go over well .
There were many important things about factor that I ’d love to talk about but did n’t have time .
Nonetheless , I think 45 minutes is a good talk length , and I think the format ( short talks ) is a key part to the Lambda Lounge ’s success so far .
Speaking of the Lambda Lounge , next month there is a “ language shootout ” – if you want to participate , be sure to join the mailing list and look over the participants .
( You need to join the list , to be able to get to the wiki with that page . )
I might submit an entry myself , using Factor or another language .
Spotify for Windows contains code so awesome that OllyDbg can't look at it without crashing .
The protection exploits , among other things , a Borland library bug that apparently has gone undetected since 1991 .
Let 's start at the beginning .
If you have n't seen it , Spotify is a music player similar to iTunes , except that it uses a massive distributed music library .
It 's ad - supported ( banners + occasional radio ads ) , but comes with a nice party mode :
If you 're using it as a jukebox for your party , you can pay a token $ 1 to disable the ads for the day .
OllyDbg is a lovely Windows debugger written by Oleh Yuschuk .
For some reason , they trust Mac users
The Macintosh version of Spotify has no anti-debugger protection at all , which is extremely odd for a product like this .
It even logs readable debug output directly to the console , so you can pinpoint e.g. the ad loading routines using nothing but dtrace :
sudo dtrace -n ' syscall : : write * : entry / execname == " Spotify " && arg0 == 2 / { trace ( copyinstr ( arg1 ) ) ; ustack ( ) ; }'
This prints a stack trace every time something is written on stderr .
Just by looking at the stack traces , you can get a reasonable overview of what is going on :
" Found audio ad " libSystem`write+0 xa libSystem`__sfvwrite+0xac libSystem`fwrite+0x74 Spotify`0x71db6 Spotify`0x720fe Spotify`0x71e5a Spotify`0x71a9 b Spotify`0x71b48 Spotify`0xb461b Spotify`0xab0d2 Spotify`0xab1fc Spotify`0xebf68 Spotify`0x64ee4 Spotify`0x65bf7 Spotify`0x669a3 Spotify`0x66e05 Spotify`0x13051 Spotify`0x44ba1 Spotify`0x4b48 b Spotify`0x7ea8e " Found banner ad " libSystem`write+0 xa libSystem`__sfvwrite+0xac libSystem`fwrite+0x74 Spotify`0x71db6 Spotify`0x720fe Spotify`0x71e5a Spotify`0x71a9 b Spotify`0x71b48 Spotify`0xb461b Spotify`0xab0d2 Spotify`0xab1fc Spotify`0xedc6a Spotify`0x125a0 Spotify`0x130fe Spotify`0x44ba1 Spotify`0x4b48 b Spotify`0x7ea8e Spotify`0x7e9ec Spotify`0x6ea6

The blue part is common to every log entry .
Presumably the entries in the 0x71000 range correspond to the printf family of functions , the function at 0xb461b is a custom log ( ) function , and the red part is ad-related :)
On Windows
On Windows , it 's an entirely different matter .
The application is suitably paranoid , and merely starting a debugger on the same machine is enough to make it run for cover .
The first stage of the loader is a simple xor / add decryption loop .
First decryption loop
Being lazy , you could try stepping through it using OllyDbg .
If you do , an interesting thing happens .
As soon as you try to step through the jump to the newly - decrypted code , OllyDbg locks up .
If you go back and try again , it turns out you do n't actually have to run the decrypted code for it to crash ; merely looking at it is enough .
The application has n't accessed anything outside of its own memory space yet , so it should n't be able to influence the debugger .
Maybe some obscure opcode sequence is able to throw Olly 's disassembler into an infinite loop ?
If you suspect a bug in your debugger , the obvious thing to do is to debug it .
Now , if you try loading a copy of Olly into Olly , then loading Spotify into the innermost debugger , something rather baffling happens : Both debuggers crash .
In fact , you can crash a whole stack of debuggers at once .
The Medusa float
By having a disassembly window open while stepping through the decryption routine , you can narrow it down to a single float - point constant which apparently is impossible to display ( this screenshot is from the patched version of OllyDbg ) :
" Dangerous " floating point constant ( in Spotify )
The crash happens in this routine , which is supposed to convert an 80 - bit floating point number ( long double ) into an unsigned 64 - bit integer ( long long ) :
Float - to - int conversion routine ( in OllyDbg )
In pseudo - C , the routine does something like this :
// convert a float to an unsigned integer , given 0 <= float < 2^64 void float80_to_uint64 ( float80 * in_ptr , uint64 * out_ptr ) { if ( float < 2^63 ) { // the number wo n't overflow , so it 's safe // to use a signed conversion float80 _to_int64 ( in_ptr , ( int64 * ) out_ptr ) ; } else { // 80 - bit floats have an explicit 1 in the mantissa , so we can just // copy the raw bits if the exponent is exactly 63 * out_ptr = *( uint64 * ) in_ptr ; } }
... where the float80 _to_int64 subroutine is implemented using the FIST instruction , which raises a floating point exception if the number does not fit into a signed 64 - bit integer .
The red comment , of course , is wrong .
An 80 - bit float has 64 bits of precision , so with an exponent of 63 it is possible to pass in a value of
2^63 - 0.5 = 111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111.1
... which , while intially less than 2^63 , will round up to 2^63 when converted to an integer .
That number is not representable as a signed 64 - bit int , and the FPU throws an exception .
The debugger dies , and since the bad number is still on the FPU stack , it is able to kill the next debugger as well .
To see it in action , try setting one of the FPU registers to 403D FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF hex .
As soon as the last character is typed , the debugger dies :
Try this at home
The faulty routine is actually part of the run-time libraries shipped with the Borland C++ compiler .
To verify , you can compile the following program with bcc32 and watch it crash in printf ( ) .
The middle window shows the result as compiled with GCC ; the right shows the buggy version :
One bit of accuracy is lost in the conversion , and the last printf ( ) crashed .
A workaround
Load OllyDbg in itself , and search ( Ctrl - S ) for the instruction sequence
fld [ ra ] fistp [ rb ]
When you find this routine ,
Original float - to - int routine
... replace it with something like
Patched float - to - int routine
The and will clear the least significant bit of the float before doing the conversion , narrowly avoiding the bad case .
To make room for the added code , the patch exploits the fact that the function is called with input and output to the same buffer , so the last 5 lines of the original are unnecessary .
Barney Frank on the Stress Tests
Barney Frank discusses with Lou Dobbs the stress test results , online gambling and proposals to legalize marijuana .
David Blunkett , the former home secretary , believes the government should scrap plans to introduce ID cards for all , in favour of mandatory biometric passports , it was reported today .
According to the BBC , the MP for Sheffield Brightside said at the InfoSec 2009 security conference , in London , that biometric passports could do the job and that he had put the idea to the home secretary , Jacqui Smith .
The proposal represents a significant U - turn for the MP who first mooted the idea of ID cards when he was home secretary in 2001 .
Asked whether ID cards could be dropped , Blunkett told the BBC : " I think it is possible to mandate biometric passports .
Most people already have a passport but they might want something more convenient to carry around than the current passport and may be able to have it as a piece of plastic for an extra cost . "
Using existing databases to hold the same information already gathered to issue passports could be a way of allaying fears over a new " database of information " , one of the key criticisms of the ID scheme .
" People do n't worry about the Passport Agency but they do worry about some mythical identity database , " he said .
Last month the home secretary said government plans for introducing ID cards were " on track " .
But as the recession puts the squeeze on government spending , there have been suggestions that the scheme , which , it is estimated , will cost £ 5 bn , could be dropped .
Mandatory biometric passports would be considerably cheaper , Blunkett claimed .
" Most of the cost is borne by the person purchasing the passport . "
The government began issuing passports containing biometric information in March 2006 .
David Cameron , the Tory leader , has already suggested ID cards would be scrapped if his party won power in the general election .

Designing DSL with explicit sharing [ was : I love purity , but it 's killing me ]

Once our DSL is extended with a let form ( so the user can declare the intention to share results of computations rather than computations themselves ) , tricky code becomes trivial .
The code remains declarative , safe and pure , and , save for the ( cosmetic ) lack of the monomorphism restriction , Haskell98 .
The well - commented code is available at http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/DSLSharing.hs
First a few comments on the tricky code .
It is true that ( absent programmer 's proclamations and code structuring forms ) a complete method of common sub-expression elimination must inspect every sub-expression in the program .
That inspection must include at least one comparison of a node with some other nodes .
As I understand the original problem had less to do with the number of comparison but more to do with the cost of a single comparison .
In an impure language , we can use constant - time physical equality .
It is usually provided natively as pointer comparison , and can be trivially emulated via mutation .
The original poster used pure Haskell and the following representation for the program graph : data Expression = Add Expression Expression | Sub Expression Expression | Variable String | Constant
Int deriving Eq
Here , the derived equality operation , albeit pure , no longer takes constant time .
Comparing nodes near the root of a deep tree really takes a while .
As the previous message on DSL with sharing showed , one can do common sub-expression elimination and the conversion of the program tree to a DAG using a constant - time node equality operation , without sacrificing purity .
The tricky function is a metaprogram that builds a large DSL program : ( tricky 12 ) yields a single DSL expression with 8191 nodes .
Such humongous expressions with thousands of components are unlikely to be written by human programmers ( although can be easily generated ) .
Many compilers will choke if we submit a program with one large expression .
( Incidentally , the previously posted code converts the tree ( tricky 12 ) to a 12 - node DAG in 0.25 secs on 1GHz Pentium ) .
The reason we can compile much larger projects is because we structure them , into compilation units , functions , let - blocks .
The structure gives the common sub-expression eliminator and other optimizer phases much needed hints and so significantly limits the search space .
For example , hardly any compiler searches for common sub-expressions across compilation units .
More importantly for us here , forms like let - expressions let the programmer declare that the results of certain computations be shared .
Although the tricky code also contains a let - expression ( masqueraded as ' where ' ) , the sharing there occurs at the meta - level and benefits the generator rather than the generated program .
We share code generators rather than the generated code .
The importance of placing ' let ' in the right phase has been extensively discussed in http://www.cs.rice.edu/~taha/publications/conference/pepm06.pdf also in the context of a DSL ( for dynamic programming ) .
In our case , we need to give our DSL programmer a way to state their intention on sharing results of DSL computations .
The programmer declares certain expressions common , and thus greatly helps the compiler as well as human readers of the code .
As Chung - chieh Shan has pointed out , we need to introduce a " let " construct in the _embedded_ language .
Since our DSL already has ( concrete ) variables with string names , we can extend our language thusly : let_ " v1 " ( add ( constant 1 ) ( variable " x ) ) ( add ( variable v1 " ) ( variable " v1 " ) )
We chose a different way : higher - order abstract syntax .
We use variables of the metalanguage ( that is , Haskell ) as let - bound variables .
Our language is now defined as > class Exp repr where > constant :: Int -> repr Int > variable :: String -> repr Int > add :: repr Int -> repr Int -> repr Int > sub :: repr Int -> repr Int -> repr Int > let_ :: repr a -> ( repr a -> repr b ) -> repr b -- like flip ( $ ) Here are simple programs in our language > a = add ( constant 10 ) ( variable " i1 " ) > b = sub ( variable " i2 " ) ( constant 2 ) > c = add a b > d = add c c > e = add d d -- " e " now as 16 leaf nodes .
> e' = let_ d ( \x -> add x x )
The programs ( e ) and ( e ' ) evaluate to the same integer given the same environment for " i1 " and " i2 " .
The two programs differ in how sharing is declared .
The program ( e ) uses the identifier ( d ) twice ; even if GHC shares the corresponding expressions rather than copies them ( a Haskell system is not obliged to share anything : sharing is not observable in Haskell98 ) , what GHC shares are metalanguage computations .
Although the metalanguage ( Haskell ) is pure , the object language does not have to be .
Indeed , the common - subexpression elimination , when considered as an evaluation of an object expression , is an impure evaluation .
The same object expression may give , in different contexts , different results ( that is , compile to different assembly code ) .
In the case of ( e ' ) , we explicitly stated that " d " is a common sub-expression .
It must be executed once , with the results shared .
The difference is easy to see if we print e and e' : * DSLSharing > test_showe " 10 + i1 + i2 - 2 + 10 + i1 + i2 - 2 + 10 + i1 + i2 - 2 + 10 + i1 + i2 - 2 " * DSLSharing > test_showe ' " let v0 = 10 + i1 + i2 - 2 + 10 + i1 + i2 - 2 in v0 + v0 " Higher - order syntax for let_ ( see e ' ) seems better than that based on concrete variable names .
As test - showe ' demonstrates , we can easily convert from higher - order abstract to the concrete syntax .
The converse is much more cumbersome .
We easily extend the previously written common sub-expression eliminator by adding the clause for let_ > instance Exp A where > ... > let_ e f = A ( do > x <- unA e > unA $ f ( A ( return x ) ) )
And that is it .
We can write the tricky function with the explicit sharing : > tricky '
0 = constant 0 > tricky ' d = let_ ( tricky ' ( d - 1 ) ) ( \g -> add g g ) > > test_tricky ' n = runState ( unA ( tricky ' n ) ) exmap0 * DSLSharing > test_tricky '
12 ( AAdd 12 , ExpMaps {hashcnt = 13 , ctmap = fromList [ ( 0,0 ) ] , vrmap = fromList [ ] , admap = fromList [ ( 1 , ( AConst 0 , AConst 0 ) ) , ( 2, ( AAdd 1 , AAdd 1 ) ) , ( 3 , ( AAdd 2 , AAdd 2 ) ) , ( 4 , ( AAdd 3 , AAdd 3 ) ) , ( 5 , ( AAdd 4 , AAdd 4 ) ) , ( 6 , ( AAdd 5 , AAdd 5 ) ) , ( 7 , ( AAdd 6 , AAdd 6 ) ) , ( 8 , ( AAdd 7 , AAdd 7 ) ) , ( 9 , ( AAdd 8 , AAdd 8 ) ) , ( 10 , ( AAdd 9 , AAdd 9 ) ) , ( 11 , ( AAdd 10 , AAdd 10 ) ) , ( 12 , ( AAdd 11 , AAdd 11 ) ) ] , sumap = fromList [ ]} ) ( 0.01 secs , 0 bytes ) Indeed it takes negligible time .
In fact , test_tricky ' 12 takes ( 0.01 secs , 561860 bytes ) test_tricky ' 100 takes ( 0.03 secs , 1444888 bytes )
If the DAG corresponding to ( test_tricky ' 100 ) were converted to a tree , it would have had 2^101 - 1 nodes ( which is more than 10^31 ) .

The car tuner JE Design started from a stock Porsche Cayenne type 957 to make this Progressor SUV .
Their version of the Porsche Cayenne is broader and more dominant than the stock version thanks to a new body kit which consists of a front skirt with LED daylight running lights , side skirts and a rear skirt extension .
The new front bumper has bigger air inlets and fierce headlamp masks that will show anyone that this Progressor is much more aggressive than the standard Cayenne .
The car ’s track width was extended by 60 mm at the front axle and by 80 mm at the rear axle and with the new extended wings and side skirts with integrated LED door sill lamps , this Progressor SUV it ’s powerful and robust .
The car received 10 × 22 ″ wheels with a classic five spike design especially made for king sized cars and it ’s equipped with high performance tires sized 295/30 R22 XL .
Wheels are painted with graphite gloss paint which is perfectly matched with the white colour varnish of this modified Porsche Cayenne .
JE Design installed reduced sport springs and an electronic lowering kit or a version 3 coilover which can lower the Progressor with 35 to 70 mm .
With these suspension modifications the car gained in sportive appearance and it also has better driving dynamics .
The rear skirt has an integrated four pipe exhaust system with chromed oval pipes and it also hosts integrated LED lights .

The Hubble Space Telescope , one of the greatest scientific instruments of all time , is about to get an extreme makeover — an overhaul so delicate and risky that NASA astronaut John Grunsfeld likens it to " brain surgery . "
At 19 years old , the famous telescope is showing its age .
Three of its scientific instruments are broken .
Half of its six gyroscopes , which keep the Hubble pointed in the right direction , are n't working .
And its batteries are slowly dying .
The seven - member crew of space shuttle Atlantis is scheduled to blast off Monday in an attempt to fix it .
It will be the fifth , final and most difficult mission to service the Hubble — a mission that was judged so risky to astronauts it was canceled in 2004 before safety precautions were added to ease the concerns .

If the work succeeds , it will mean a glorious rebirth of the Hubble .
The telescope would be 90 times more powerful than when it was launched in 1990 .
If the mission fails , astronomy 's crown jewel could become a $ 6.9 billion " piece of space junk " with no chance to save it , astronaut and mission commander Scott Altman says .
No other flights to Hubble are planned .
That 's because the shuttle — the only vehicle that can reach the telescope — is 17 months from retirement .
There had always been the possibility of " another shot " at Hubble , says Mike Weiss , the telescope 's deputy program manager .
That 's no longer the case .
" This is the last opportunity , " Weiss says .
" There 's no margin for error . "
Even if Hubble were to blink off tomorrow , it would leave a legacy richer and more vast than that of any other astronomy tool .
It has more discoveries to its credit than any other observatory , NASA 's Jon Morse says .
It " has already earned its place in history as a triumph of science in our modern era , " says Heidi Hammel , an astronomer at the Space Science Institute , a research institute .
" Hubble brings the heavens down to us . "
Hubble has : • Helped narrow the age of the universe to 12 billion to 14 billion years , rather than the 10 billion to 20 billion years known previously .
•
Captured the farthest pictures of deep space ever taken , showing early galaxies born in the era when the first stars were forming .
•
Detected exploding stars in a pattern that suggested a mysterious " dark energy " is propelling galaxies apart .
• Provided the first analysis of the atmosphere of planets in other solar systems and taken the first picture of such a planet .
For all those accomplishments , the Hubble 's potential is perhaps even more tantalizing .
The period after the mission will be " the grand finale of the Hubble symphony , " says David Leckrone , Hubble project scientist at NASA .
" Everything we 've done up to this point , " he says , " has been in preparation for these final five years , where Hubble is at its peak of capability . "
Viewing deep into space Hubble 's namesake is the late U.S. astronomer Edwin Hubble , who discovered that our galaxy is only one of countless others .
The observatory owes its scientific achievements mostly to one simple fact :
It 's out in space .
Images snapped by telescopes on the ground are distorted by the Earth 's atmosphere , as if they had been taken though a grimy windshield .
Hubble sits comfortably above the atmosphere , offering a stunningly clear view of the universe .
That vantage point makes it possible for Hubble to produce pictures such as the famous Ultra Deep Field : a snapshot showing 10,000 galaxies , some not long after they emerged from the Big Bang .
Its lofty perch also means that Hubble does n't contend with light pollution — the haze of city light and moonlight that can blind ground - based telescopes .
That allows Hubble to see very faint objects , including those that are very far away .
All these advantages add up to make Hubble " the most powerful astronomical observatory in history , " wrote a National Research Council committee that assessed options for fixing the telescope .
The committee said the shuttle mission should proceed , noting that no telescope with Hubble 's powers will be built for decades .
A potential of a retooled Hubble , the committee said , " would be comparable to the telescope 's promise when first launched . "
Restoring Hubble to full health will be such a daunting task that NASA officials such as Hubble program manager Preston Burch play down the likelihood of a complete success .
None of the previous missions to fix the telescope has been so packed with chores .
And never before have astronauts tried to repair Hubble 's scientific instruments .
Astronauts have made four house calls on Hubble .
The first was to fix a humiliating goof discovered after Hubble 's launch :
Its main mirror turned out to be defective because of a manufacturing error , and the telescope produced only blurry pictures .
During a 1993 mission , astronauts installed a $ 74 million series of mirrors that acted like eyeglasses to correct Hubble 's squint .
Previous visits were " heart surgery on Hubble , " says Grunsfeld , who will make his third mission as a Hubble - repair spacewalker .
This one is " comparable to doing brain surgery . "
Consider what Grunsfeld faces to fix the Advanced Camera for Surveys , which snapped some of Hubble 's best - known images .
Its builders thought no one would work on the camera , so they closed it with 36 tiny screws — impossible to handle wearing a spacewalker 's clunky gloves .
To fix the camera , Grunsfeld will have to pull out four circuit boards with razor - sharp edges , which could puncture his spacesuit .
He 'll do all this without a good direct view of what he 's touching , because the work site is around a corner and deep in the bowels of the telescope .
To make the camera repair possible , engineers at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. , custom - built several tools to aid Grunsfeld .
One , a forceps - like instrument , will be used to grip the circuit boards and yank them out .
Another grasps the miniature screws so they do n't float away .
A loose screw inside Hubble might seem trivial , but even a minute foreign object could be disastrous for the telescope .
It would take only " an immeasurable amount of debris in the right place to cause problems with the telescope 's ability to image , " says astronaut Andrew Feustel , who will perform three spacewalks during the mission .
The frailty of the Hubble and the complexity of the mission were brought into focus last fall , when a critical system on the telescope failed just 2 ½ weeks before the scheduled launch .
NASA delayed the mission while engineers devised a fix .
Now the hour is at hand — again — and the anxiety and anticipation are running high .
" I can hardly wait , " Leckrone says .
" Let 's get this thing off . "
Making it safer Just as Hubble faces risks from the astronauts ' visit , the astronauts themselves face dangers from trying to fix it .
If Atlantis is badly damaged by launch debris or space junk , the telescope - repair team can't take refuge on the International Space Station , the way all other shuttle crews can .
The station will be just too far away .
That led Sean O'Keefe , then the head of NASA , to cancel the mission in 2004 .
A public outcry ensued .
Schoolchildren pooled their lunch money to fund a rescue of Hubble , and ordinary citizens flooded NASA 's website with protests .
O'Keefe 's successor , Michael Griffin , reinstated the servicing mission in 2006 after satisfying himself that the mission 's risks could be minimized .
To make sure the crew can be rescued , NASA added an unprecedented safety measure : A second shuttle will be waiting on the launch pad , ready to go to space , when Atlantis lifts off .
That means that a second shuttle crew could rescue the Hubble astronauts before they run out of air or food .
None of this comes cheaply .
A shuttle flight costs roughly $ 500 million , and the new scientific instruments and other hardware add up to $ 887 million .
Even so , there 's little opposition among scientists to the mission to fix Hubble , says astronomer Warren Moos of Johns Hopkins University .
" The community is very excited , " he says .
During the upcoming mission , Hubble will be fitted with two new sophisticated scientific instruments in addition to the two now in orbit that will be fixed .
" We will be getting a whole new telescope , " says Mario Livio of the Space Telescope Science Institute , the non-profit group that manages the observatory .
The scientific possibilities after Hubble 's makeover " are just endless and exciting and hard to fathom , " Leckrone says .
Among the questions a refurbished Hubble will tackle : • How common are planets outside our solar system , and how big are they ?
•
How and when do galaxies form stars ? •
What 's the composition of the cosmic " web , " the filaments of stuff that fill the universe and make up most of its matter ?
When a new observatory opens , astronomers generally foresee only half of its major discoveries .
The same can be expected with Hubble , said the National Research Council committee , meaning that the greatest science that lies ahead cannot be predicted .
Eventually Hubble , which was originally envisioned to last 10 to 15 years , will have to take a bow .
NASA expects to get five to seven more years of life out of it , assuming the repairs succeed , before it makes a controlled plunge into the ocean .
In a few years , NASA will launch a Hubble follow - up , the James Webb Space Telescope , named for a former NASA chief who is not related to Sen.
Jim Webb , D - Va .
The Webb telescope wo n't be able to see objects that emit ultraviolet light , as Hubble can , nor will it have Hubble 's talent for taking pictures in ordinary light .
In some areas , though , it will " clean our clocks , " Leckrone says .
The Webb , for instance , should be able to find galaxies that are even closer to emerging from the Big Bang , because it specializes in detecting light from the earliest stars .
Crewmembers want to give the Hubble 's successor a high bar to cross .
They know a lot is riding on this mission .
Altman , who was also commander of the last Hubble repair mission in 2002 , recalls thinking at that time : " Well , there 's going to be another servicing mission coming around . "
" This time , this is it , " he says , " So we 're going to be giving it our best . "

Microsoft has launched another commercial attacking Apple products – and this time it ’s gone straight for the jugular .
Last week ’s initial ad featured a shopper who said they could n’t find a Mac to meet their budget and mocked the cool image the firm has among shoppers .
The follow - up is even more to the point .
This time the shopper , Giampolo , looks at a Mac and exclaims “ This is so sexy ! ”
But having already established he is “ tech - savvy ” and wants to customize his machine , he concludes “ Macs to me are all about aesthetics more than they are the computing power .
I do n’t want to pay for the brand , I want to pay for the computer . ”
Here is the ad :
As with the first ad , the shopper winds up buying an HP laptop which he says fits the brief ; the concept of the ads is that if a shopper finds any brand of computer which does so within budget , Microsoft picks up the tab .
Several Apple supporters have already taken issue with the claims , arguing that the machine Giampolo chose has a pretty ropey battery life and is very bulky given he was looking for portability .
It ’s also intriguing that a shopper who touts themselves as tech - savvy appears not to have investigated the possibility of getting a Linux - based laptop , which would free up some cash to upgrade the hardware .
Then again , that may not be the easiest task for someone looking in mainstream stores .
While Microsoft execs have attacked Apple as favoring style over substance before , it ’s rare that their marketing would flat out acknowledge a strength of a rival – the eyecatching design of a MacBook – even if it then attacks the product ’s other characteristics .
But the big problem with the ads are that , no matter how genuine the exercise may have been , many viewers will assume there is some manipulation involved .
Indeed , even if one of the independent shoppers had wound up choosing a Mac , is there really any prospect of their experience making the airwaves ?

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Apple is hiring new employees from the semiconductor industry and is building the capability to design its own chips , the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday .
The iPhone and iPod maker hopes its efforts will lead to new features for its devices and enable it to share fewer details about it plans with outside chip vendors , the report said , citing people familiar with Apple ’s plans .
An Apple spokesman confirmed the company has hired both Bob Drebin , former chief technology office of the graphics products group at chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices and Raja Koduri , who previously held the same position .
The spokesman decline to comment further .
Drebin ’s Linked
In page lists him as a senior director at Apple .
The hires were reported or rumoured in a number of online outlets earlier in the week .
Apple has been hiring engineers to create multifunction chips that are used in cell phones , the Journal report said .
Sources familiar with Apple ’s plans do n’t expect internally designed chips to emerge until next year at the earliest , it said .
Last year , Apple acquired P.A. Semi , a designer of low - power microchips , in a move analysts said bolstered its ability to customize key parts for its iPhone , iPod and Macintosh product lines .
Shares of Cupertino , California - based Apple closed up $ 1.24 at $ 125.14 .
Eritrea is accused of using a border dispute to justify endless conscription The Eritrean government is turning its country into a giant prison , according to Human Rights Watch .
The Horn of Africa nation is widely using military conscription without end , as well as arbitrary detention of its citizens , says HRW .
Hundreds of Eritrean refugees forcibly repatriated from countries like Libya , Egypt and Malta face arrest and torture upon their return , says the group .
Religious persecution and forced labour are also rife in Eritrea , says HRW .

The report urges countries not to send back Eritrean asylum - seekers and calls on the international community and donors to exert pressure on the government in Asmara over its rights record .
HRW says every year thousands of Eritreans flee their country , where statutory national service , which used to last 18 months , has been made indefinite .
The advocacy group says most of Eritrea 's adult population is currently conscripted .
Sixteen years after it won independence from Ethiopia following a three - decade war , Eritrea is one of the most closed and repressive states in the world , says the report .
It accuses President Isayas Afewerki of using an unresolved border dispute with Ethiopia to keep Eritrea on a permanent war - footing .
HRW says there is no independent civil society and all independent media outlets have been shut down .
People under the age of 50 are rarely granted visas to leave the country and those who try to do so without documentation face imprisonment and torture or being shot at the border , says the group .
Prisoners are often held in underground cells or in shipping containers with dangerously high temperatures , according to the report .
Meanwhile , Christians are being rounded up and tortured on a regular basis , says the group .
The BBC's Pascale Harter spoke to Salamay , a 16 - year - old Eritrean refugee in Italy .
She said she fled when police began rounding up youths in her village for national service .
In Sudan , she said a family took her hostage and forced her to work without pay .
In Libya , she was taken to a prison where inmates faced rape every night by the guards .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The rising price of gasoline is putting pressure on cash - strapped motorists and throwing barricades into the path of a speedy economic recovery .
The national average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gas edged up to $ 2.488 on Saturday , from $ 2.467 the day before , according to motorist group AAA .
That marks the 32nd consecutive increase .
In that one - month period , the average price of gas jumped more than 20 % .
That surge is causing concern for drivers as the summer driving season gets underway .
Americans are already dealing with high unemployment and a collapsing housing market .
If gas prices continue to climb at their heady rates , Americans who are living " paycheck to paycheck " could put the brakes on their plans to tool around this summer , crimping some of the government 's efforts to pull the economy out of recession , said Tom Kloza , chief oil analyst for the Oil Price Information Service .
" There 's way too much optimism about a driving season lift , " said Kloza , who believes that higher prices , in conjunction with the recession , will dampen the typical summer travel surge .
Kloza said the impact will be especially painful in economic " sore spots " like California , Florida , Arizona and the rural South .
Gas is particularly expensive in California , where the average price is $ 2.725 a gallon .
In Arizona , the average price is less expensive , at $ 2.341 a gallon .
Currently , the highest gas prices are in Alaska , where prices average $ 2.752 per gallon .
The cheapest gas can be found in South Carolina , where the average is $ 2.299 a gallon .
Despite the recent surge , the average price of a gallon of gas remains 40 % below its all - time peak of $ 4.114 on July 17 , 2008 .
But the repercussions of that peak are still being felt .
Kloza said that drivers are more likely to focus on the recent increases , than to feel relieved that gas prices are off their 2008 peak .
" People are crazy when it comes to the price of gasoline , " he said .
" Nothing has quite the emotional component than gas prices do . "
Last year 's gas price spike also severely hampered demand for SUVs and trucks , hastening the downward spiral for the Big Three automakers .
Chrysler filed for bankruptcy on April 30 and is awaiting a ruling from a federal judge as to whether it may sell its assets and form a new company .
General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) is expected to file for bankruptcy next week and its stock price is trading below $ 1 a share for the first time since the Great Depression .
Beginning March 22nd , 2009 , Alaska 's Mount Redoubt , began a series of volcanic eruptions , and continues to be active to this date .
Ash clouds produced by Redoubt have pushed 65,000 feet into the sky , disrupting air traffic , drifting across Cook Inlet , and depositing layers of gritty ash on populated areas of the Kenai Peninsula and Anchorage , about 180 km ( 110 miles ) to the northeast .
Mount Redoubt has erupted at least five times since 1900 , with the most recent event taking place in 1989 .

A new video shot by a passerby and obtained by the Guardian captures the moment Ian Tomlinson hits the pavement after allegedly being assaulted by a police officer on 1 April guardian.co.uk
Footage has emerged showing the moment Ian Tomlinson 's head hit the pavement after he was pushed over by a police officer at the G20 protests .
The video also revealed fresh details about events leading up to the alleged assault on Tomlinson .
It appears to confirm ­witness testimony that the 47 - year - old showed no resistance to advancing lines of police in the moments before he was hit and pushed to the ground .
The footage was shot by an anonymous bystander on Cornhill , near the Bank of England .
It was handed over exclusively to the Guardian and the Independent Police Complaints Commission , which is ­conducting the criminal inquiry into ­Tomlinson 's death .
The four - minute video was shot with a high - quality camera between 7.10 pm and 7.30 pm on 1 April .
There are several moments in the footage that capture Tomlinson , a newspaper vendor who had been attempting to get home when he was pushed over , wandering around the crowd .
At no point does he appear to confront police or protesters in an aggressive way , or ­provoke an altercation .
Last night the IPCC attempted to secure a court order to prevent the broadcast of a truncated ­version of the film that appeared ­momentarily on YouTube .
The truncated version was copied by Channel 4 News , which planned to broadcast it , before it was removed from YouTube .
But a judge refused to grant the injunction .
The IPCC said : " We can confirm that we attempted to seek an injunction this evening against Channel 4 as it came to light that they were due to broadcast ­further evidence which we believe at this moment would potentially damage our criminal investigation into the death of Ian Tomlinson .
This injunction was specific to what was due to be broadcast this evening . "
The attempt by the IPCC to prevent the broadcast of the video appeared to contradict the stance taken by its chairman , Nick Hardwick , several hours earlier .
Hardwick told MPs on the Commons home affairs select committee yesterday he did not believe web footage of incidents at the demonstrations would prejudice legal proceedings .
" We would rather it was not on the web but I do n't think it is a serious risk and we have to deal with the world as it is rather than as we would wish it to be , " he said .
ITN , which produces Channel 4 News and More 4 News , said the broadcast was " a responsible piece of journalism that brings important information into the public domain . "
Channel 4 will ­broadcast the short clip tonight .
The full version of the video handed to the Guardian and the IPCC shows the lead - up to the alleged assault on Tomlinson , including an incident in which a policeman appeared to grab a protester .
The protester 's head was then hit against the door of a police van .
That sparked an angry reaction from the crowd , which began running toward Royal Exchange Passage .
A crucial sequence then captures the seconds leading up to the moment Tomlinson is pushed .
Tomlinson is seen in the middle of Royal Exchange Passage , facing the advancing lines of police .
His hands are in his pockets and he is standing behind a rack of bicycles .
When an officer takes a dog close to him , Tomlinson turns his back .
Footage obtained by the Guardian two weeks ago showed how around this time Tomlinson was hit on the legs with a truncheon and pushed to the ground by a Met territorial support group officer .
The officer was questioned under caution for manslaughter last week .
' World 's oldest woman ' dies at 130 ... after slipping in bathroom of new flat Kazakhstan gave her to celebrate her age
A woman thought to be the world 's oldest person at 130 has died after slipping on the bathroom floor of her new flat .
Sakhan Dosova broke her hip in a fall last month and never recovered .
She had been given the flat by officials in Kazakhstan who were embarrassed she was living in overcrowded conditions with her impoverished family .
Her age came to light after a census in the city of Karaganda .
Demographers also found she was on Stalin 's first census of the region in 1926 , with her age given as 47 .
Ten years old when Hitler was born : Sakhan Dosova , who apparently turned 130 on March 27 , in a recent picture
' She broke her hip in the fall and never recovered , ' said a neighbour .
The woman 's date of birth was officially registered as 27 March 1879 , and was shown on her documents including her Soviet era passport and independent Kazakhstan identity card .
Until the recent census , however , her fame did not extend beyond her far - flung city .
Proof ? :
Note the birth date on her Kazakh identity card - March 27 , 1879
In an interview in March , she said : ' I do n't have any special secret .
I 've never taken pills and if I was ill , I used grannies ' remedies to cure me .
I have never eaten sweets .
' I do n't like them .
But I love kurt , a salty dried cottage cheese , and talkan , ground wheat . '
Gaukhar Kanieva , 42 , her granddaughter , said : ' We think laughter and her good mood helped her live so long . '
Once she was discovered , local officials rushed to congratulate her and provide her with new housing and gifts .
The mayor of Karaganda , Islam Togaybayev , went to visit her ' to personally congratulate her on such an achievement and show his respect ' , said his spokesman .
Some experts doubted her age , and claimed that while she was clearly very old , she may have exaggerated her years in Soviet times to claim special benefits .
But local demographers insisted there was sound documentary evidence of her age .
She outlived all but three of her children .
If her age was correct , it meant she was was born when Queen Victoria still had 22 more years to rule in Britain and Disraeli was prime minister .
It was the year that Stalin and Einstein were born , the Anglo - Zulu war started , and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle published his first story .
The year 1879 also saw Edison present his new invention - the light bulb - while the ill - fated last tsar of Russia was just 11 years old .
She was ten when Hitler was born , 38 when Lenin led the Russian Revolution , and reached retirement age , 60 , the year the Second World War began .
According to one account of her life , twice married Sarkan was widowed at the Battle of Stalingrad during the Second World War .
Only three of her children remain alive .
Dosova 's claim came too late to be confirmed to the satisfaction of international bodies measuring world records .
Officially , the oldest living person in the world is American Edna Parker of the US at 114 years - old .

Taiwan Solar Powered Stadium by Toyo Ito
Construction is finished for Japanese architect Toyo Ito ’s Solar Powered Stadium in Taiwan .
The stadium ’s roof is covered by 8,844 solar panels .
The stadium is located in Kaohsiung , Taiwan and it was built to coincide with the opening of the World Games , to be held this July .
The “ World Games Stadium ” holds 55,000 spectators and it cost $ 150 million to build .
The stadium will hold the record for largest solar - powered stadium in the world with it ’s 14,155 m2 roof .
It could potentially generate 1.14 gigawatt hours of electricity every year , enough to power up to 80 % of the sorrounding neighbourhood .

OTTAWA – The federal cabinet is considering a $ 150 - million fund for the country 's private broadcasters to help rescue local TV stations and their newscasts , The Canadian Press has learned .
Members of the cabinet priorities and planning committee met today to discuss their options for helping broadcasters who warn they are stretched to the max , sources said .
The discussions came on the same day that Canwest Global Communications , which owns Global TV network , faced another deadline for reaching a debt repayment schedule with its lenders .
They also came as the government announced nearly $ 1 billion to guarantee warranties on new vehicles sold by GM Canada ( NYSE : GM ) and Chrysler LLC .
Canwest , CTVglobemedia and Quebecor have all been lobbying Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's Conservative government to come up with both short - term and long - term assistance .
Harper has met with Canwest 's CEO Leonard Asper and Quebecor 's Pierre Karl Peladeau in the last few months .
The $ 150 - million local programming fund would be tied to news and current affairs programming , and would favour smaller urban centres .
A formula would be worked out to ensure that big cities such as Toronto and Montreal did not swallow up the lion 's share of the cash .
Whether the CBC would be eligible is still unclear , although the private broadcasters have been lobbying vigorously against it .
The CBC is facing a $ 170 - million shortfall this year and is planning 800 layoffs .
One source said the discussions are still " fluid . "
Proposals have been batted back and forth between cabinet and the Department of Canadian Heritage .
The idea of help for local television has widespread support in cabinet and among the Conservative caucus , where the issue has come up repeatedly at weekly meetings .
Last month , Heritage Minister James Moore confirmed that the government was considering the issue but he would not reveal the details .
The question of how exactly to help the broadcasters is a sticky one .
Some Tories favour an approach that tweaks regulations and helps the broadcasters financially , rather than simply handing them more money .
Most of that conversation has centred around the concept of " fee for carriage , " a practice whereby the broadcasters could charge the cable companies for transmitting their signals .
But getting the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications ( CRTC ) to make that change quickly is complicated .
The commission is currently reviewing the licenses of all the broadcasters , and is also looking at the regulatory regime as a whole .
The change would also be decried by the cable and satellite companies , who warn the fees would be passed on at least in part to the consumer .
" The government is trying to address something in the short term , while recognizing that regulatory changes need to take place – but that will take some time , " said one source .
The political landscape has become more fertile for broadcasters in recent months .
MPs have been clamouring for help for local TV stations , as they feel pressure from constituents who are bracing for the planned closures and sale of their stations .
Local TV is also a critical venue for MPs to get out their particular messages .
The Commons heritage committee is currently studying the issue of local TV broadcasting , and MPs from both the Conservative party and the Liberals seemed to be pressing for movement on the fee - for - carriage .

Obama / Cheney Oppose Accountability
President Barack Obama and former Vice President Dick Cheney agree that it would be wrong to hold Bush administration officials accountable for torture and other crimes .
In a speech last week , Obama faulted those who wanted to inject accountability into the process with the comment , “ there ’s a tendency in Washington to spend our time pointing fingers at one another . ”
( The story summary continues below . )
Immediately afterwards , Cheney said prosecuting people involved in harsh interrogations would be “ treating political disagreements as a punishable offense and political opponents as criminals . ”
However , David Swanson of afterdowningstreet.org says both men distorted the positions of critics who are concerned about the future -- in that they understand the need for accountability as a means of preventing future abuses -- and are not concerned about policy differences but about crimes .
" Torture was always illegal , " Swanson said .

A YEAR ago tomorrow , more than 1000 of the nation 's best and brightest gathered , enthusiastic and idealistic , for Prime Minister Kevin Rudd 's 2020 talkfest .
" We are throwing open the windows of our democracy , " the Prime Minister declared , and over two days the ideas flew forth , some sweepingly ambitious , a few a bit crazy , in hope of striking a chord .
The Prime Minister asked the 10 groups for one big idea each , three concrete policy ideas , and three 2020 goals .
Participants laboured with butcher 's paper .
Mr Rudd promised responses by year 's end , but these were delayed , first until January , then , as Government attention was focused on the global crisis , put off again .
The summit became very " 2008 " for a Government with the new all - consuming priority of the economy .
Now , finally , the responses are to be released to coincide with Wednesday 's community cabinet in Perth .
Action is being announced on nine modest proposals , including a children 's TV station , " golden gurus " ( retired people who would become workforce mentors ) , a study for an indigenous national knowledge and cultural centre , and backing for the bionic eye .
Road bikes :
If the bike has a traditional straight top tube that is parallel to the ground , you should have approximately 1 " of clearance between the ground and tires when you lift the bike as you ’re straddling it .
If the bike has a sloping top tube ( semi- compact or compact design ) expect to have clearance of 2 " or more .
Both men’s and women ’s bikes can have compact frames .
Mountain bikes :
When you lift the bike , you want 2 " minimum clearance between the tires and the ground .
If your bike has full suspension , it ’s okay to have less initial clearance ( 1 " –2 " ) because the suspension compresses under your weight once you sit on the bike .
That said , the amount of clearance is largely affected by the slope of the top tube down toward the rear wheel .
For example , if the slope is dramatic , you 'll likely have ample clearance no matter what size the frame is .
Because of this , you can't rely solely on standover clearance to determine if a bike fits .
Hybrid bikes :
If your hybrid bike is a city commuter , use the road bike guidelines .
If it ’s a beach cruiser or a step - through style , you do n’t really have to worry about standover height .
Most of these have steeply sloping top tubes that let you step over easily and put your feet flat on the ground when seated .
Bike Standover Height : Online Shopping Tips
TOKYO — I followed the instructions of the watchful cashier and took off my shoes , sanitized my hands , placed my bag in a locker and dangled an ID card ( “ customer # 18 ” ) from a lanyard around my neck .
The cashier then gave me a once over and a shallow bow , and I padded quietly into the sitting room of the cafe .
“ She ’s the prettiest girl we have at our cafe .
Everybody wants to touch her , but we ask that customers only do so if she does n't resist you , ” a waitress told me .
She did n’t resist .
And since I was paying for the privilege , I leaned in and stroked her cheek .
She was as lovely as the waitress had promised : a big-eyed , silky soft , compliant 2 - year - old Russian Blue cat .
I was at Calico , one of Tokyo ’s increasingly popular cat cafes , where customers seeking human and feline companionship pay to sip tea and stroke one of the 20 - odd resident cats , representing 17 different breeds .
In an increasingly childless and aging nation , cat cafes fill a void .
The more fortunate Japanese are the middle - aged couples who cradle Dachshunds like grandchildren at car dealerships and the young women who hand feed their Maltese puppies on park benches .
For those who live with long work hours , no - pet apartments and work - related travel , there are cat cafes .
I first heard of Calico cat cafe when it opened in March 2007 , but then it was an oddity and the preserve of lonely women and cat fanciers .
It is now staggeringly popular .
This March it opened a second branch in the high - rent Shinjuku business and shopping district .
Last October it published a glossy coffee table book featuring its “ feline staff . ”
The original branch is so packed that reservations are recommended on weekends .
Browsing in a bookstore , I found 39 establishments listed in the “ cat cafe yellow page ” section of a magazine .
Calico advertises itself as a great " date spot , " a place to make “ friends ” — both cats and humans — and a " fun place " to swing by after work .
Tokyo was n’t always like this .
When I grew up here in the 1980s , people had both children and pets .
But in the past decade , the Japanese have chosen to have fewer children , while they keep more pets .
The fertility rate , or average number of children born to a woman , was 3.65 in 1950 , but had dropped to 2.13 by 1970 .
By the time I was born in 1980 , it was 1.75 .
The rate now hovers at a little above one child per woman .
The estimate for 2009 is that an average woman will bear 1.21 children .
Because of this low birth rate , many people go to fertility festivals .
When I visited Calico cat cafe on a Saturday afternoon , it was packed almost to capacity with young couples on dates , older married couples making an afternoon of it and young women in ones and twos .
One shy man struggled to draw attention from the cats , the people and even the staff .
A bored husband slept , mouth gaping and fingers loosened around the cat toy in his lap .
Men and women jockeyed for prime positions near the waking cats and took photos on cellphone cameras of cats snoozing in baskets and lapping at water bowls .
A waiter handed me a laminated page of rules : wear your cat - access pass around your neck at all times ; no one under 5th grade may enter ; cats too young to be held have scarves around their necks ; do not hold or stroke a cat if it resists you ; never wake a napping cat ; bringing cat nip or cat food to the cafe is strictly forbidden .
“ Is this a rare breed , this one that looks like a poodle ? ” a woman asked a waitress while her husband snapped a photo of the sour - faced cat .
“ Oh yes , Kukuru is very rare .
She ’s one of around only 20 in all of Japan , ” the waitress replied .
The husband grunted , impressed , and stroked the sleeping cat .
A few yards away , two young women waged a near silent and very polite battle over a complimentary plastic bag of six pieces of dried cat food .
( Customers were permitted to use the food to try to lure cats to come closer . )
All but three of the cats were asleep when I left the room full of adults vying for their attention , crawling on the floor with cat toys shaped like miniature fishing rods and brandishing their cellphone cameras .
As I paid up , the cashier bowed and offered me a complimentary postcard - sized photograph of cats that had been made into a sticker .
It had been a bargain , albeit a strange one :
An hour of commitment - free cat stroking cost me only $ 9 .
Editor 's note :
This story was corrected to reflect that the Japanese have more pets now than they used to have .

Principles of XML design
When to use elements versus attributes
Exploring the oldest question in XML design
Content series :
This content is part # of # in the series : Principles of XML design Stay tuned for additional content in this series .
This content is part of the series : Principles of XML design Stay tuned for additional content in this series .
Several frequently pondered questions of DTD design in SGML have followed the legacy to its offshoot , XML .
Regardless of what XML schema language you use , you might find yourself asking :
When do I use elements and when do I use attributes for presenting bits of information ?
When do I require an order for elements , and when do I just allow arbitrary order ?
When do I use wrapper elements around sequences of similar elements ?
In my experience working with users of XML , the first question is by far the most common .
In some cases the answer is pretty unambiguous :
If the information in question could be itself marked up with elements , put it in an element .
If the information is suitable for attribute form , but could end up as multiple attributes of the same name on the same element , use child elements instead .
If the information is required to be in a standard DTD - like attribute type such as ID , IDREF , or ENTITY , use an attribute .
If the information should not be normalized for white space , use elements .
( XML processors normalize attributes in ways that can change the raw text of the attribute value . )
Unfortunately , design decisions do n't often fall into such neat categories .
The question remains how to make the right choice in the gray areas .
The usual answer is No single answer is right , use your best judgment .
But this is not very helpful for those trying to find their feet with XML .
True , even experts do not always agree on what to do in certain situations , but this is no reason not to offer basic guidelines for choosing between XML and attributes .
First I want to comment on two guidelines that I have heard and do not recommend .
I have heard Just make everything an element .
The reasons given range from Attributes just complicate things to Attributes can stunt extensibility .
But if you do not use attributes , you are leaving out a very important aspect of XML 's power , and you 're probably better off using some delimited text format .
I have also heard
If it is the sort of material you would expect to display in a browser , use element content .
The problem with this guideline is that it encourages people to think of XML content design in terms of presentation , two considerations that should not be mixed .
I present a very similar guideline in this article , but I express it in terms of the intent of the content , rather than in terms of presentation .
In the rest of this article , I present a set of guidelines that I do recommend when choosing between elements and attributes .
Recommended guidelines
I have divided these guidelines into a set of principles that I think frame the choice between elements and attributes overall .
None of the guidelines are meant to be absolute ; use them as rules of thumb and feel free to break the rules whenever your particular needs require it .
Principle of core content
If you consider the information in question to be part of the essential material that is being expressed or communicated in the XML , put it in an element .
For human - readable documents this generally means the core content that is being communicated to the reader .
For machine - oriented records formats this generally means the data that comes directly from the problem domain .
If you consider the information to be peripheral or incidental to the main communication , or purely intended to help applications process the main communication , use attributes .
This avoids cluttering up the core content with auxiliary material .
For machine - oriented records formats , this generally means application - specific notations on the main data from the problem - domain .
As an example , I have seen many XML formats , usually home - grown in businesses , where document titles were placed in an attribute .
I think a title is such a fundamental part of the communication of a document that it should always be in element content .
On the other hand , I have often seen cases where internal product identifiers were thrown as elements into descriptive records of the product .
In some of these cases , attributes were more appropriate because the specific internal product code would not be of primary interest to most readers or processors of the document , especially when the ID was of a very long or inscrutable format .
You might have heard the principle data goes in elements , metadata in attributes .
The above two paragraphs really express the same principle , but in more deliberate and less fuzzy language .
Famous exceptions
I 've been careful to point out that my design guidelines are flexible and that you will certainly find reason to make exceptions .
You 'll also find the need to balance the impetus from different principles .
In many examples of standard XML vocabularies , conscious design decisions were made that contradict principles I post in this article .
Here is a sampling .
SVG vector paths are expressed as a series of space - delimited numbers in a single attribute , which contradicts the Principle of structured information .
This decision was made because SVG had an urgent need for terseness , but it has been criticized because of how it can complicate the processing of SVG formats .
Many formats that allow Cascading Stylesheet ( CSS ) styles in attributes ( such as XHTML 1.0 and XSL - FO ) allow you to create complex descriptions of style , mixing multiple facets and units of measure .
This contradicts the Principle of structured information .
Interestingly , this is no longer a concern in XHTML 2.0 because with that version you can only specify a class token that is mapped to a separate CSS .
You no longer have in - line style attributes .
Principle of structured information
If the information is expressed in a structured form , especially if the structure may be extensible , use elements .
On the other hand :
If the information is expressed as an atomic token , use attributes .
Elements are the extensible engine for expressing structure in XML .
Almost all XML processing tools are designed around this fact , and if you break down structured information properly into elements , you 'll find that your processing tools complement your design , and that you thereby gain productivity and maintainability .
Attributes are designed for expressing simple properties of the information represented in an element .
If you work against the basic architecture of XML by shoehorning structured information into attributes you may gain some specious terseness and convenience , but you will probably pay in maintenance costs .
Dates are a good example : A date has fixed structure and generally acts as a single token , so it makes sense as an attribute ( preferably expressed in ISO - 8601 ) .
Representing personal names , on the other hand , is a case where I 've seen this principle surprise designers .
I see names in attributes a lot , but I have always argued that personal names should be in element content .
A personal name has surprisingly variable structure ( in some cultures you can cause confusion or offense by omitting honorifics or assuming an order of parts of names ) .
A personal name is also rarely an atomic token .
As an example , sometimes you may want to search or sort by a forename and sometimes by a surname .
I should point out that it is just as problematic to shoehorn a full name into the content of a single element as it is to put it in an attribute .
Thus :
< customer > < name > Gabriel Okara</ name > < occupation > Poet</ occupation > </ customer >
is not much better than :
< customer name = " Gabriel Okara " > < occupation > Poet</ occupation > </ customer >
I hope to expand on the treatment of people 's names in markup in a future article .
Principle of readability
If the information is intended to be read and understood by a person , use elements .
In general this guideline places prose in element content .
If the information is most readily understood and digested by a machine , use attributes .
In general this guideline means that information tokens that are not natural language go in attributes .
In some cases , people can decipher the information being represented but need a machine to use it properly .
URLs are a great example : People have learned to read URLs through exposure in Web browsers and e-mail messages , but a URL is usually not much use without the computer to retrieve the referenced resource .
Some database identifiers are also quite readable ( although established database management best practice discourages using IDs that could have business meaning ) , but such IDs are usually props for machine processing .
For these reasons I recommend putting URLs and IDs in attributes .
Principle of element / attribute binding
Use an element if you need its value to be modified by another attribute .
XML establishes a very strong conceptual bond between an attribute and the element in which it appears .
An attribute provides some property or modification of that particular element .
Processing tools for XML tend to follow this concept and it is almost always a terrible idea to have one attribute modify another .
For example , if you are designing a format for a restaurant menu and you include the portion sizes of items on the menu , you may decide that this is not really important to the typical reader of the menu format so you apply the Principle of core content and make it an attribute .
The first attempt is :
< menu > < menu-item portion = " 250 mL " > < name > Small soft drink </ name > </ menu-item > < menu-item portion = " 500 g " > < name > Sirloin steak </ name > </menu-item > </ menu >
Following the Principle of structured information you decide not to shoehorn the portion measurement and units into a single attribute , but instead of using an element , you opt for :
< menu > < menu-item portion - size = " 250 " portion - unit= " mL " > < name > Small soft drink </ name > </ menu-item > < menu-item portion - size = " 500 " portion - unit= " g " >
< name > Sirloin steak </ name > </menu-item > </ menu >
The attribute portion - unit now modifies portion - size , which as I 've mentioned is a bad idea .
An attribute on the element menu - item should modify that element , and nothing else .
The solution is to give in and use an element :
< menu > < menu-item > < portion unit= " mL " >250</portion > < name > Small soft drink </ name > </menu-item > < menu-item > < portion unit= " g " >500</ portion > < name > Sirloin steak </ name > </menu-item > </ menu >
In this case I applied a mix of the Principle of core content and the Principle of readability to the decision to put the value in content and the units in an attribute .
This is one of those cases that are less cut and dried , and other schemes might be as suitable as mine .
The solution also involves contradicting the original decision to put the portion size into an attribute based on the Principle of core content .
This illustrates that sometimes the principles will lead to conflicting conclusions where you 'll have to use your own judgment to decide on each specific matter .
No substitute for study and experience
XML design is a matter for professionals , and if you want to gain value from XML you should be willing to study XML design principles .
Many developers accept that programming code benefits from careful design , but in the case of XML they decide it 's OK to just do what seems to work .
This is a distinction that I have seen lead to real and painful costs down the road .
All it takes for you to learn sound XML design is to pay attention to the issues .
Examine standard XML vocabularies designed by experts .
Take note of your own design decisions and gauge the positive and negative effect each has had on later developments .
As you gain experience , your instinct will become the most important tool in making design decisions , and the care you take will pay certain rewards if you find yourself using XML to any significant extent .
I plan to continue covering XML design principles in future articles such as this one .
I 'll also continue to touch briefly on issues of XML design in my Thinking XML column .

The final post in our Britannia in Brief series is a fantastic article from co-author William Mullins about how to behave in a British pub .
I ’m glad he decided to write about this as I ’ve experienced the confusion of being a pub for the first time .
Be sure to check out the rest of the posts for Britannia in Brief Week .
It should be straightforward – I mean , you ’ve got bars here in the US – but I ’ve always been struck by the trepidation that fills visitors to Britain the first time they have to step up to the bar at the pub and navigate the strange ritual of British pub etiquette .
Quite understandably , no one wants to make a public fool of themselves in that inner sanctum of British culture , the public house .
In our book Britannia in Brief my wife Leslie , who blogged here on Anglotopia on Tuesday , and I explain the different kinds of pubs you ’ll encounter , what they ’ll serve in different parts of the country and how to navigate the culture .
Following are a few tips which will help maximize your own pub-roving travels !
Do’s
Go to the bar to order drinks .
Only very smart establishments , ( i.e. not pubs , ) will have table service .
Order beer by the pint ( men ) or half - pint ( women ) ; never by the bottle .
Pay for your drinks when you ’re served , and expect to pay in cash .
Offer to buy drinks for all your party rather than just slipping off to bar on the quiet .
The British tend to drink in rounds – etiquette of rounds can get complicated , ) so if your offer is taken up , do n’t be alarmed – you ’re off the hook until everyone ’s had a turn .
( Though if you want a glass of water or a packet of crisps , or some such , as well as a drink go get that yourself .
Don’ts
Tipping will cause confusion .
If you must , offer to buy the bartender drink which they may chalk up for later , but most Brits would only go to this extreme if the publican had just single - handedly rescued him and his family from a burning car .
Do n’t be afraid to bring a child to the pub during the day , especially in the country .
Unlike America , this wo n’t have social services coming to take your child away !
The pub is not the place to order frou - frou drinks .
No self - respecting publican will serve Long Island Ice Tea , Buttery Nipple shots or Espresso Martinis .
This is n’t to say there are n’t pubs that will serve these , it ’s just that they ’re not the sort of pubs any self - respecting tippler should frequent .
Do n’t ask for or expect the bar staff to pour you a particuarly large measure of liquor .
Though prices vary between pubs , measures do not and are strictly regulated by law .
For spirits the standard serving is 25 ml , the EU having done away with the wonderful old measures : 1/6th of a gill in England and 1/4th of a gill in Scotland .
Be a little more reticent about drumming up conversation than you would be at home .
It ’s not that people do n’t want to talk to you , it ’s just that they ’re a little taken aback when someone they ’d never laid eyes five minutes before suddenly sticks out their hand and introduces themselves as Tim from Topeka .
To the Brits this sort of bumptiousness is annoying and plays to all their stereotypes of the loud American .
Break the stereotype , be yourself , be patient , do n’t try to hard , go with the flow and you ’ll find yourself welcomed and appreciated by the natives !

( Eastern edition ) .
New York , N.Y. : Apr 23 , 1992 .
pg. A13 Imagine my surprise when a Wall Street Journal editorial appointed me dean of the Pat Buchanan school of neo-isolationism .
My credentials ?
Believing that the Pentagon 's new strategy -- America as " Globocop " -- could render the United States a hollow superpower .
All agree we need the military capacity to defend our vital interests -- by ourselves when need be .
The question is grand strategy .
With the Journal 's endorsement , the Pentagon has called for a Pax Americana : The U.S. should cast so large a military shadow that no rival dare emerge .
American hegemony might be a pleasant idea , but is it economically , politically or even militarily wise ?
Bristling with weapons , we would continue our economic decline , while rising industrial and financial giants in Europe and Asia viewed our military pretensions with indifference or contempt .
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney outdid even the Journal , dipping deep into the well of Cold War argumentation to accuse Pax Americana critics of thinking " America 's world presence is somehow immoral and dangerous . "
Why does n't the Journal stop the namecalling , get its schools sorted out , and court an honest debate over America 's proper role in the new world order ?
Pat Buchanan's " America First " preaches martyrdom :
We 've been suckered into fighting " other " people 's battles and defending " other " people 's interests .
With our dismal economy , this siren song holds some appeal .
But most Americans , myself included , reject 1930s - style isolationism .
They expect to see the strong hand of American leadership in world affairs , and they know that economic retreat would yield nothing other than a lower standard of living .
They understand further that many security threats -- the spread of high - tech weapons , environmental degradation , overpopulation , narcotics trafficking , migration -- require global solutions .
What about America as globocop ?
First , our 21st - century strategy has to be a shade more clever than Mao 's axiom that power comes from the barrel of a gun .
Power also emanates from a solid bank balance , the ability to dominate and penetrate markets , and the economic leverage to wield diplomatic clout .
Second , the plan is passive where it needs to be aggressive .
The Journal endorses a global security system in which we destroy rogue - state threats as they arise .
Fine , but let 's prevent such problems early rather than curing them late .
Having contained Soviet communism until it dissolved , we need a new strategy of " containment " -- based , like NATO , on collective action , but directed against weapons proliferation .
The reality is that we can slow proliferation to a snail 's pace if we stop irresponsible technology transfers .
Fortunately , nearly all suppliers are finally showing restraint .
The maverick is China , which persists in hawking sensitive weapons and technology to the likes of Syria , Iran , Libya , Algeria and Pakistan -- even while pledging otherwise .
The Senate has tried to force China 's leaders to choose between Third World arms sales ( 1991 profits of $ 500 million ) and open trade with the U.S. ( a $ 12.5 billion annual Chinese surplus ) .
Even though we have convincing intelligence that China 's leaders fear the use of this leverage , the president inexplicably refuses to challenge Beijing .
Weapons containment can't be foolproof ; and against a nuclear - armed North Korea , I would support pre-emptive military action if necessary .
But let 's do our best -- using supplier restraint and sanctions against outlaw sellers and buyers - to avoid having to round up the posse .
Why not an anti-proliferation " czar " in the cabinet to give this objective the prominence it urgently needs ?
Third , Pax Americana is a direct slap at two of our closest allies -- Japan and Germany -- and a repudiation of one of our panel1 .
Rather than denigrating collective security , we should regularize the kind of multilateral response we assembled for the Gulf War .
Why not breathe life into the U.N. Charter ?
great postwar triumphs .
For years , American leaders argued that building democracy in Europe and Asia would guarantee stability because democracies do n't start wars .
Now the Pentagon says we must keep our military large enough to persuade Japan and Germany " not to aspire to a greater role even to protect their legitimate interests .
" How has our success suddenly become a threat ?
It has n't , but the Pentagon plan could become a self - fulfilling prophecy .
By insulting Tokyo and Berlin , and arrogating to ourselves military stewardship of the world , we may spark the revival no one wants .
Secretary Cheney says he wants the allies to share the burden on defense matters .
But Pax Americana puts us on the wrong end of a paradox : Hegemony means that even our allies can force ever greater U.S. defense spending the more they try to share the burden !
Fourth , collective security does n't rule out unilateral action .
The Journal says I 'm among those who want " Americans . . . to trust their security to a global committee . "
But no one advocates that we repeal the " inherent " right of self - defense enshrined in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter .
Secretary Cheney says his plan would n't undermine support for the U.N .
Who would know better than the U.N. 's usually understated secretary general ?
If implemented , says Boutros Boutros - Ghali , the Pentagon 's strategy would spell " the end of the U.N. "
Rather than denigrating collective security , we should regularize the kind of multilateral response we assembled for the Gulf War .
Why not breathe life into the U.N. Charter ?
It envisages a permanent commitment of forces , for use by the Security Council .
That means a presumption of collective action -- but with a U.S. veto .
Rather than defending military extravagance , the Bush administration should be reallocating Pentagon funds to meet more urgent security needs : sustaining democracy in the former Soviet empire ; supporting U.N. peacekeepers in Yugoslavia , Cambodia and El Salvador ; and rebuilding a weakened and debt - burdened America .
If Pentagon strategists and their kneejerk supporters could broaden their horizons , they would see how our superpower status is best assured .
We must get lean militarily , revitalize American economic strength , and exercise a diplomatic leadership that puts new muscle into institutions of collective security .

Twitter is an ever - more - popular social networking tool for people and companies to use to send messages and stay in touch with people .
If you ’re not familiar with twitter , it ’s basically like the status line of Facebook , but with some extra ( very minimal ) messaging components .
A lot of people are using twitter to stay in touch and talk ( including a lot of bands ) , so there are usually a lot of conversations flying around , all of which are publicly accessible .
The interesting part about this is that twitter gives you the ability to search through everyone ’s messages to see what they are talking about .
Below are a few fascinating music - related twitter searches that you might want to try .
I admit , there are likely more interesting searches that you could probably come up with , so if you think of a good one that is n’t listed , post it here in the comments !

Adam discovered the role of 12 different genes in yeast cells Scientists have created an ideal colleague - a robot that performs hundreds of repetitive experiments .
The robot , called Adam , is the first machine to have independently " discovered new scientific knowledge " .
It has already identified the role of several genes in yeast cells , and is able to plan further experiments to test its own hypotheses .
The UK - based team that built Adam at Aberystwyth University describes the breakthrough in the journal Science .
Ross King from the department of computer science at Aberystwyth University , and who led the team , told BBC News that he envisaged a future when human scientists ' time would be " freed up to do more advanced experiments " .
Robotic colleagues , he said , could carry out the more mundane and time - consuming tasks .
" Adam is a prototype but , in 10 - 20 years , I think machines like this could be commonly used in laboratories , " said Professor King .
Robotic planning Adam can carry out up to 1,000 experiments each day , and was designed to investigate the function of genes in yeast cells - it has worked out the role of 12 of these genes .
Biologists use the yeast cells to investigate biological systems because they are simple and easy to study .
" When you sequence the yeast genome - the 6,000 different genes contained in yeast - you know what all the component parts are , but you do n't know what they do , " explained Professor King .
Robots express scientific findings in a much clearer form than humans
Professor Ross King
Aberystwyth University
The robot was able to work out the role of the genes by observing yeast cells as they grew .
It used existing information about the function of known genes to make predictions about the role an unknown gene might play in the cell 's growth .
It then tested this by looking at a strain of yeast from which that gene had been removed .
" It 's like a car , " Professor King said .
" If you remove one component from the engine , then drive the car to see how it performs , you can find out what that particular component does . "
Expensive assistant Duc Pham from the Manufacturing Engineering Centre at Cardiff University described the robot scientist as " a clever application of robotics and computer software " .
But , he added , " it 's more like a junior lab assistant " than a scientist .
" It will be a long time before computers can replace human scientists . "
Professor King agreed that the robot was in its early stages of development .

" If you spent all of the money we 've spent on Adam on employing human biologists , Adam probably would n't turn out to be the cost - effective option , " he said .
" But that was the case with the first car .
Initially , the investment in the technology was n't as cost - effective as sticking with horses . "
He also pointed out that his robotic associate is able to express scientific findings in a clearer way than humans .
" It expresses its conclusions in logic , " he said .
" Human language , with all its nuances , may not be the best way to communicate scientific findings . "
The same team is developing another , more advanced robot scientist called Eve , which is designed to screen new drugs .

For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
On the campaign trail last year , Alaska ’s Republican governor , Sarah Palin , sold herself as a crusading reformer who despised earmarks –those federal spending projects that Capitol Hill legislators of both parties slip into appropriations bills .
Though her claim to have turned down an earmark for the now - infamous Bridge to Nowhere was debunked by assorted media outlets , she kept on insisting that if she were elected vice president , she would lead a charge in Washington against earmarks .
That was then .
The omnibus spending bill that President Barack Obama signed on Wednesday includes earmarks that Palin sought .
The $ 410 billion bill has been lambasted by Republicans and a few Democrats for being loaded with nearly 9,000 earmarks covering $ 7.7 billion in projects .
Senator John McCain , Palin ’s former ticket - mate , has blasted Obama for supporting the earmark - laden legislation .
( “ So much for the promise of change , ” an angry McCain howled from the Senate floor . )
But earmarks in the bill are quite generous to Palin ’s state .
According to Taxpayers for Common Sense , a Washington - based watchdog group , Alaska will receive more money , per capita , from the bill ’s earmarks than any other state .
( Alaska will pocket $ 209.71 for each state resident . )
One hundred earmarks in the bill , worth a total of $ 143.9 million , are tagged for Palin ’s state .
Asked by Mother Jones about the Alaska earmarks , Bill McAllister , Palin ’s communications director , pointed to Sen. Lisa Murkowski ( R - Alaska ) and Rep. Don Young ( R - Alaska ) as responsible for these provisions .
But in an email , he noted that a “ few of [ the Alaska earmarks ] were requested directly ” by Palin .
But how many ?
And which ones ?
McAllister declined to say .
Mother Jones also asked McAllister if Palin believes it was appropriate for Murkowski and Young to insert these earmarks into the legislation and whether she will reject any earmarked funds .
He did not answer those queries either .
At the Republican convention in Minneapolis last summer , Palin introduced herself to America by declaring she was a foe of wasteful spending who had “ championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by Congress . ”
She claimed that she had said “ thanks , but no thanks ” to America ’s most infamous earmark , the Bridge to Nowhere .
During the presidential campaign , McCain railed incessantly against earmarks , at one point thundering that if he made it to White House , “ I will take an ink pen and I will veto every pork barrel earmark spending bill that comes across my desk . ”
In trying to beat back the omnibus spending bill , McCain denounced earmarking as a “ corrupt practice . ”
And he employed the timeworn tactic of publicly mocking silly sounding appropriations : “ How does anyone justify some of these earmarks : $ 1.7 million for pig odor research in Iowa ; $ 2 million ‘ for the promotion of astronomy ’ in Hawaii ; $ 6.6 million for termite research in New Orleans ; $ 2.1 million for the Center for Grape Genetics in New York . ”
But , as they often say in Washington , one legislator ’s pork is another legislator ’s necessary program .
The earmarks that Palin apparently will accept could also be ridiculed in a McCain - ish fashion .
They include $ 475,000 to construct a “ heritage center ” in the Chilkat Indian Village ; $ 150,000 to support private industry participation in two international fishery groups ; $ 200,000 for investigating and prosecuting bootlegging ; $ 200,000 for researching the king crab ; and $ 855,000 for building fairgrounds .
The Alaska earmarks also include $ 1.2 million for construction work on an airport on Akutan , a tiny island that relies on seaplane for contact with the Alaskan mainland .
( The Coast Guard handles medical emergencies . )
The island has roughly 800 residents .
Could this be dubbed the Airport to Nowhere ?
Whether or not any of these projects is worthwhile –the people of Akutan might need an airport to keep their community alive –Palin is certainly not decrying earmarks when they are benefiting her state .
Alaska ’s earmarks have been primarily the handiwork of Murkowski and Young .
Former Senator Ted Stevens secured some of them , but had then transferred to Murkowski when he lost his seat in the 2008 elections after being convicted on corruption charges .
According to Taxpayers for Common Sense , Murkowski scored big with 71 solo earmarks , the second highest number in the Senate , totaling over $ 74 million .
( Counting also the earmarks she requested jointly with other legislators , Murkowski won a total of $ 181.5 million in projects . )
Young , Alaska ’s only House representative , obtained 10 solo earmarks , worth $ 22.5 million .
All his earmarks total $ 71.3 million , making him the 11th most productive earmark - seeker in the House .
All of this funding is headed Alaska ’s way even though , according to Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers , Alaska is one of the few states that experienced an increase in employment during 2008 .
( “ Our state budget is under control , ” Palin said at the convention .
“ We have a surplus . ” )
Despite her ample earmarking , Murkowski harshly criticized Obama ’s stimulus bill for containing wasteful spending .
“ At a time when every dollar counts , ” she said , “ we went overboard . ”
Yet she voted for the omnibus spending legislation –because of the earmarks .
“ Although I have concerns about the price tag of this bill , ” she explained , “ I heard from a number of Alaskans telling me how important some of the Alaska - specific projects were to their cities , towns , communities and villages .
Defeat of this bill could have resulted in Alaska missing out on nearly $ 200 million in funding . ”
In other words , earmarks rule in Alaska .
And Palin , who last year tried to ride an anti-earmarks campaign into the vice presidency , is apparently willing to exploit the earmarks process , make her own requests , accept all the money that comes , and put that crusade of hers on hold .

MIT professor , Daniela Rus , got the project off the ground with a two - part study course on the basics of making and programming robots , and by the fall term , her students were growing tomatoes with the help of the robots ’ mechanical arms .
It was all part of a challenge of tackling a “ distributed robotic garden ” to be completed by the end of the semester .
The lab now houses four cherry tomato plants in a plywood base covered in fake grass and beside the pots is a docking station for the robot gardeners .
Scientists say robots have been effective as factory assembly workers and for in - home purposes , such as serving as health care aides .
But they also could be useful in agriculture by tending to the soil in unpredictable environments .
According to Wikipedia , the main application of robots in agriculture has mostly been at the harvesting stage , letting them perform functions like thinning apple trees , picking fruit and asparagus and shearing sheep .
While millions have been spent on research , the ag industry is behind other industries in using robots because the jobs on farms are n’t always predictable and formulaic .
Tending and nurturing can depend on the type of fruit , color and other factors .
“ None of the machines have sufficient capacity to compete with human beings , ” says Tony Grift , an associate professor in the Dept. of Agriculture and Biological Engineering at the University of Illinois .
But MIT professors are leading future scientists down that road , figuring robots might do less harm to the environment than humans .
“ Agriculture contributes a lot of damage to the land , the soil , the water and the environment , ” says Rus .
“ So if we can figure out a way of using robots and automation to deliver nutrients to plants – pesticides , fertilizers , water when it ’s needed – instead of sort of mass spreading them , then we hope we would have an impact on the environment . ”
These days it seems everybody has some sort of recycled / eco friendly paper offering .
So what ’s the big deal about a Swedish offering making its US debut on Earth Day this year ?
White Lines factory reuses their carbon emissions in a closed loop , making for zero CO2 emissions , for one .
Then they offset what they ca n’t reuse ( transportation , etc ) via planting trees in Africa , as coordinated by environmental consultancy U&W ( interestingly pronounced “ You & We ” in Swedish )
The wood used for the paper comes from locally sourced , sustainably managed forests , and woodchip waste from sawmills .
And every package tells you the precise carbon footprint , the materials traced back to the source .
And then it gets interesting .
[ social_buttons ]
The paper uses white lines rather then black or blue .
And ?
And that means less visual competition between pen/pencil strokes on the line .
This does two things :
When copying or faxing , the white lines disappear , so you can draw using grid paper as a guide , then when others see it , all there is is your drawing .
For those learning to write , the focus is squarely on the writing , without the distraction of other lines .
For those that want to be thorough in their commitment to sustainable choices as a business , this would seem to be an excellent choice .
Going paperless is an admirable goal , but as it stands , there ’s still a need for paper use .
Why not do it with paper of this caliber ?
Update : I ’ve now been told it ’s available domestically in the US today , through Amazon .
Official launch is Earth Day , but they ’re quietly available now .
I ’m getting some myself , actually .
Readers :
What other everyday things in your work do you see value in changing , and what are you doing / using to change it ?
Comment below please .
MILAN -
The first third of the Tour of Italy is now behind us , and it 's time for the riders to have their first rest day .
It has been well earned .
The past nine days of racing since we started May 9 have been action packed and full of drama , and the effects are starting to show on a weary field .
Today 's stage was the first that was truly stress free - both on the mind and the body .
The course was a 10 - mile circuit around the city of Milan that resembled a really big criterium .
We were to do 10 laps around the course , which would make for a 100 - mile day .
As we did our first lap it was clear that the riders were tired of the crazy , stressful and dangerous finishing circuits that have defined many of the first week 's stages .
This course was more of the same , with railroad tracks scattered throughout - even in some of the turns .
Immediately , the riders decided together to protest the stage .
After seeing one of our own - Spanish rider Pedro Horrillo of the Rabobank team - seriously injured in a crash on Saturday that briefly left him in a coma , we were n't messing around .
So we decided to come to a complete stop at the finish line after completing one of the circuits .
Race leader Danilo Di Luca was elected to speak for the field , and he announced to the crowd of thousands that we felt that the course was too dangerous to race for the overall classification .
We came to a compromise with the Giro 's organizers : Riders still interested in racing could contest the stage for the win but no time from today 's stage would count toward the overall classification .
Team Astana benefited greatly from the decision , since we no longer had to risk our top riders in an attempt to remain in contention for the overall win .
As a result , with the exception of Daniel Navarro , the Astana team stayed out of trouble and away from crashes .
And with Danny suffering only a small amount of road rash , we felt like it was a successful day .
Most of the team dropped back from the main field with six miles to go and finished together with the other race favorites , several minutes back from the stage winner , Mark Cavendish of Team Columbia .
Immediately after crossing the finish line , we headed back to the team bus .
We had to prepare for a 150 - mile transfer to the hotel for the night , so we got straight to work showering and preparing for the trip .
Everyone was motivated to get on the road quickly , since the sooner we got going the sooner we would be at the next destination .
Once again , our bus had a huge crowd all around it as fans clamored for Lance Armstrong 's autograph or picture .
As with every other stage , Lance did n't disappoint .
He jumped out of the bus as soon as he had showered and took a few minutes to make the crowd 's day .
The guy is a machine when it comes to everything he does , going non -stop to try to fulfill everyone 's expectations .
He signs hundreds of autographs every day , even when the rest of us are so tired we could n't even think about leaving our comfy seats .
In the bus our spirits were high .
I settled into my spot on the couch , to talk about the stage with the boys and take in some more calories .
After that , it was time to go .
I focused on winding down and relaxing , passing the time with my beloved portable DVD player .
Technology is my best friend on the road !
So far Team Astana has stuck to the plan , to save as much energy as we can for the next two crucial weeks of racing .
With only some minor time loss for Levi and myself on the second stage , and Danny 's small crash today , we feel pretty good about how we have survived the crazy first block of racing here at the Giro .
The team is looking great for the coming weeks , where we will hopefully have a chance to show how strong the team really is by getting the leader 's jersey and / or some stage wins .
Monday is a day off from racing .
This will be the only chance to rest up and recover before the next six days of hard racing begin , where the stages are going to become more and more epic .
That is where the real battle to become the winner of the 100th anniversary of the Giro will begin to build .
Any physical problems one has been having until now will have to be solved in the next 36 hours since the next stages are sure to reveal any weaknesses a rider has been hiding from the group .
Tuesday 's Stage 10 is the first of the Grand Tour stages .
At 160 miles with three huge climbs , it will test everyone 's fitness and push all us to the limit for the first time in this year 's Giro .
Anyone who makes it through this stage with the leaders will stand a chance of winning the Giro .
Thursday 's Stage 12 is the race against the clock , but once again organizers of the Giro have put a new twist on an old classic .
At 36 miles with climbs and twisty descents , it will be an hour and half of pure suffering , and potentially a make - or - break stage for the overall contenders .
After Stage 12 the pressure will build on those who can win the Giro .
Media , friends , family , and those who think they are friends will begin to swarm in , adding more stress and taking up more of the precious recovery time .
Soon , it will get to the point where the only time you have to yourself will be when you are asleep in your bed .
So for all the fans watching the race , I know Monday may be a let down without your daily fix of racing .
But do n't worry , because come Tuesday the race is on .
Thanks for reading !
Until tomorrow ...
A coating of “ feathers ” on this cylinder in an airflow modifies the vortical structures behind it ( shown in orange and blue ) , cutting aerodynamic drag by about 15 % .
The solid line in the graph shows the drag on the coated cylinder , the dashed line that of one with a smooth surface ( Image : Julien Favier )
Coating the rigid wings of airplanes with artificial bristles that mimic feathers could make them more efficient , according to engineers .
An Italian team has demonstrated how feather - like structures help reduce drag on a cylinder and says they could have the same effect on underwater and aerial vehicles .
Birds use long , stiff flight feathers to help generate the lift and thrust needed to get off the ground and to stay aloft .
But Alessandro Bottaro at the University of Genoa is more interested in how a set of smaller feathers – called coverts – keep birds flying efficiently .
Although they may not look like they can have much of an effect , during gliding some covert feathers stick up at right angles to the wing ’s surface and vibrate in the airflow .
To test whether this has any effect on flight performance Bottaro and Julien Favier , also at Genoa , added synthetic coverts to a computer model of a 20 - centimetre - diameter cylinder and put it in a virtual wind tunnel .

Drag race
Their synthetic feathers are modelled as rigid keratin bristles 4 to 6 centimetres long and 0.5 millimetres in diameter , coating the cylinder at a density of around three fibres per square centimetre .
The cylinder was orientated with its long axis perpendicular to the air flow , placing the synthetic feathers parallel to the wind .
As the wind speed increased the bristles started to vibrate in a similar way to real covert feathers , reducing the drag on the cylinder by 15 % .
The researchers say that ’s because the fibres help to cushion the effects of the air flow on the cylinder itself .
Normally the air flows rapidly across the cylinder and creates an area of low pressure behind it .
This encourages the formation of strong vortices , creating turbulence and increasing the drag on the cylinder .
Racing car drivers exploit that area of low pressure – the slipstream – to stay close to their rivals without having to combat the drag experienced by the car in front .
With the feathers , the low - pressure slipstream does not form , and the vortices affecting the cylinder are weaker .
A similar process explains why fresh , fuzzy tennis balls can speed through the air faster than worn ones , says Bottaro .
Preening problem
Bottaro thinks artificial feathers could be added to aircraft or underwater vehicles to improve their efficiency .
Though , he adds , they might need a self - cleaning system to mimic the way birds preen their feathers to ensure efficient performance .
“ I think the [ new ] finding has relevance for the field of fluid mechanics , but not so much for our understanding of bird wing aerodynamics , ” says David Lentink from University of Wageningen , in the Netherlands , who leads a team that developed “ RoboSwift ” – a remote - controlled small aircraft that changes the shape of its wings like an acrobatic bird to improve its aerodynamic performance .
Other recent lessons on fluid mechanics from nature include a study last year that suggested the way dolphins wrinkle their skin when swimming at high speed could provide a new tactic to reduce drag on submarines .

" So many days I just did not feel like getting covered in paint .
Sometimes I was sick or tired and one day I even had a fever of 102 degrees so I just could n't do it .
I did do one the next day and I was still so hot that the paint ran down my face "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Obama earned high marks for diplomacy during his first overseas trip , and a majority of Americans think that he will return home with some accomplishments in his pocket , according to results of a poll released Monday .
Nearing the end of his first overseas trip , President Obama addresses the Turkish Parliament on Monday in Ankara .
A large majority , 79 percent , said people in other countries will have a more positive view of the United States because of Obama , while 19 percent said it would be more negative , according to the CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll .
Asked whether Obama has accomplished anything on his trip , 16 percent said that he had accomplished a great deal , while 45 percent thought he had accomplished a fair amount during this trip that took him to a summit with European Union leaders in the Czech Republic , the Group of 20 meeting in England and the NATO summit in France .
" The American public seems to think that Obama 's primary achievement on his trip so far was increasing good will rather than winning specific concessions from other countries , " said Keating Holland , CNN 's polling director .
" Obama seems to have made a good first impression on the world stage , and Americans appear to have noticed . "

Worldwide protest against Israeli violence in Gaza
By David Walsh
7 January 2009
Widespread revulsion against the murderous Israeli assault on the population of the Gaza Strip has sparked protest on every continent .
Hundreds of demonstrations have taken place in cities large and small , from Bogota to Manila , Sofia to Ottawa , Dublin to New Delhi , in addition to dozens of cities in the US and major urban centers in Israel itself .
It would be impossible to provide details on every protest , but the following is intended to convey the depth and global character of the response .
Following the mass demonstrations held January 3 ( see “ Ground assault sparks worldwide protests — Civilian casualties mount as Israeli army slices through Gaza ” ) , including in every major European and North American city , protests have continued in all parts of the globe .
Thousands , for example , demonstrated in Beirut Sunday outside the United Nations building while others marched on the US embassy .
Lebanese police used water hoses to keep the protesters away from the embassy .
Hundreds marched in Amman , Jordan , on Sunday in two separate marches .
More than 5,000 marched in Istanbul Sunday , waving Palestinian flags and burning effigies of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and President George W. Bush .
Protesters also threw eggs at the Israeli consulate in the Turkish city .
According to the Associated Press , tens of thousands rallied in Rabat , the Moroccan capital , for a protest against the Israeli offensive in Gaza .
“ Police estimated the turnout at 50,000 .…
Organizers said the number was bigger , but did not give a precise figure . ”
Thousands of Afghans rallied against Israel ’s offensive last Friday in Kabul .
More than 1,000 protesters rallied outside a mosque , waving Hamas flags and chanting , “ Death to America , Israel and Britain ! ”
About 1,000 people demonstrated in the Afghan city of Herat on Friday as well , shouting , “ Down with Israel ! ”
Demonstrations have taken place across Egypt , in defiance of the Mubarak regime , since the Israeli attack began December 27 .
Protesters have been met with clubs and beatings from police .
Hundreds of arrests have been made .
Despite this , some 3,500 Muslim Brotherhood members took to the streets Monday in Assiut , some 200 miles south of Cairo .
In Kashmir , Indian police used tear gas and batons to disperse hundreds of protesters in Srinagar , Indian Kashmir ’s major city .
The crowd chanted , “ We ’re with the Palestinians ” and “ Down with Israel ! ”
Thirty people were injured in the police crackdown and 50 detained .
Some 70 students from universities in New Delhi threw shoes at the Israeli embassy on Monday .
A student leader explained , “ We are protesting against the terror attack of Israel on the citizens of Palestine .
First it was Bush who got the shoes and now it is the time for Israel . ”
The protesters threw some 200 shoes at the embassy before police arrested them .
One hundred members of the left - nationalist Bayan Muna in Manila staged a rally at the Israeli embassy Monday .
The group condemned the Israeli attacks that have left hundreds dead .
Rep. Satur Ocampo told the media , “ We add our voices to the growing international condemnation of Israel ’s invasion of Gaza .
As a former colony , we Filipinos should sympathize with the Palestinian people who are the aggrieved party in this war . ”
Saudi police arrested two activists attempting to stage a demonstration in Riyadh last Thursday .
The AFP reports , “ The arrests came a day after the interior ministry denied organizers permission to hold the rally on the grounds that demonstrations are banned in Saudi Arabia . ”
Earlier , police fired rubber bullets to break up “ rare protests involving hundreds of pro-Palestinian demonstrators in Qatif and Safwa in the eastern part of the country . ”
Hundreds of people from the Palestinian community in Bogota , the Colombian capital , protested outside the Israeli embassy last Friday .
The protesters marched from Bolivar Square to the embassy , demanding peace for the Palestinian people .
In Sao Paulo , Brazil , several hundred people gathered outside the Sao Paulo Art Museum to protest the Israeli offensive in Gaza .
Several demonstrators carried Palestinian flags , according to news reports , and banners reading , “ End the Genocide in Gaza . ” Demonstrations have also been held in Buenos Aires .
In addition to the large protests held in various Australian cities ( see “ Australian demonstrations show solidarity with Palestinian people ” ) , sizable rallies have also been organized in New Zealand against the Israeli incursion in Gaza .
Approximately 1,000 pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched in central Wellington Tuesday .
They delivered a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs attacking the Israeli offensive and denouncing the New Zealand government ’s “ neutral stance . ”
Father Gerald Burns , a Catholic priest , sprinkled red paint , mixed with his own blood , on a memorial to former Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin , “ to mark the killing of hundreds of Palestinians and the seizure of their land . ”
Palestinian Ihab Almawajah , 19 , told a reporter that “ his cousin was killed in the first of the Israeli strikes in Gaza .
‘ It ’s not fair on innocent people ....
We hope the world understands that all Palestine wants is peace ’ ” ( Xinhua ) .
Large demonstrations took place in London , Paris , Rome , Athens and other European cities last weekend .
Demonstrations continued in London on Sunday and Monday , with police making 10 arrests on Sunday .
Many other British cities witnessed protests , including Birmingham , Manchester , Liverpool and Newcastle .
Several hundred protesters assembled in Huddersfield in West Yorkshire Monday night calling for an end to violence in the Middle East .
Local councillor Mehboob Kahn commented : “ I was in Gaza two years ago to monitor the first ever local elections that the Palestinians had in Gaza and at the time there was a ceasefire and the elections were an important part of the peace .
“ The Israelis broke the ceasefire in Gaza and the team were bombed from the air by Israeli airplanes — it was horrific for that to happen and to witness it first hand . ”
Safiya Abdullah , 22 , according to the local press , has taken the lead in organizing a protest scheduled for next weekend in Gloucester in southwest England .
She commented : “ A group of us decided to hold the march after seeing the news reports — we could n’t stand seeing so many people killed .
We thought somebody should do something about it .
It is an atrocity and a massacre .
“ In my opinion it has gone beyond religion and beyond nationality .
It is human suffering .
We just want to express how we feel . ”
In response to the news of the bombing of two UN schools in Gaza , several hundred rallied in Dublin Tuesday at the Israeli embassy .
Politicians , academics , union leaders and members of the Palestinian - Irish and Lebanese - Irish communities addressed the gathering , which also marched on the US and Egyptian embassies .
On Saturday , police used teargas to disperse a protest outside the Israeli embassy in Oslo .
Several hundred protesters took part .
They threw fireworks , eggs and stones at the police and the embassy building .
“ Shoes were also thrown at police officers , ” Norwegian television reported .
The Associated Press reported that some 800 marchers “ in the Swiss capital Bern carried banners accusing Israel of terrorism Friday [ January 3 ] as demonstrators demanded an immediate cease - fire in Gaza . …
“ Several held signs equating the Jewish state with Nazi Germany , while others accused Israel and its ally , the United States , of being ‘ terrorists . ’ ” Further rallies were planned in major Swiss cities for Sunday .
Wire services reported that protests were staged in several Balkan countries January 2 and 3 to protest the violence in Gaza .
Several hundred people demonstrated in Belgrade ’s main Republic Square on Monday against the military assault .
The Sofia Echo reports that in the Bulgarian mining town of Madan , with a predominantly Muslim community of 7,000 , some 1,000 marched in a peaceful protest January 2 against the developments in Gaza .
Shefket Hadji , “ a spiritual guide at the local mosque , ” told the media that the protest was “ provoked by the inhumane way in which people treated one another in that part of the world . ”
Hadji “ underlined the fact that people in Madan expressed their feelings as citizens and human beings , and not only as Muslims . ”
Protesters from several nearby villages participated in the protest .
A largely peaceful protest in the Cypriot capital of Nicosia on Saturday turned violent , according to press accounts , when some protesters tried to break through police lines blocking the road to the Israeli embassy .
And on Monday , the Muslim community and supporters on the island of Malta held a protest against Israeli aggression .
The protest took place in Valletta , Malta ’s capital , in Freedom Square .
Vancouver , Montreal , Toronto , Winnipeg and Ottawa have all witnessed protests against the Israeli military attacks .
Some 5,000 people marched through downtown Montreal Sunday in a three - hour rally .
The Ottawa Citizen reported that the size of the crowd made Ahmed Benhamade “ very , very happy . ”
Benhamade was “ accompanied by his wife , Halima Salahiddin , their 18 - month - old daughter , Safina , tightly bundled in winter gear and seated wide - eyed in a stroller .
‘ It shows that this cause is just , ’ Benhamade declared .
‘ We are here for justice and we are here for peace . ’ ” Five thousand people attended a rally in downtown Toronto on Saturday as well .
Protests have been organized in many US cities .
There have been demonstrations , of course , in New York , Los Angeles , Chicago , Boston and San Francisco , but many smaller communities have also hosted rallies against Israeli aggression .
In Greenville , South Carolina , for example , 150 Arab - Americans and others marched through the streets Sunday .
The Greenville News reports : “ Several carried Palestinian flags and pictures of bloodied children while the crowd chanted ‘ stop the occupation ’ and ‘ free , free Palestine . ’
They said the incursion was killing women , children and the elderly and that the United States should end its aid to Israel .
“ ‘ We feel like our brothers and sisters are being killed , ’ said one of the protesters , Haroon Raja , 22 , of Greenville . ”
Several hundred people rallied in downtown Atlanta Monday evening outside the building that houses the Israeli consulate .
One protester held a homemade sign that read , “ Who killed us ?
Israel did . ”
Another 250 people gathered in Portland , Oregon , Sunday in a protest .
The demonstrators chanted , “ Occupation is a crime , from Iraq to Palestine ” and “ Stop killing the children ! ” Arab - American youth chanted slogans in Arabic and English .
One homemade sign read , “ Massacre in Gaza : Made in USA ! ”
Hundreds of demonstrators in Minneapolis and Muslims living in Sioux Falls , South Dakota , marched last Friday to protest the Israeli offensive .
In Sioux Falls , protester John Koch told the local media , “ We want to get the message out that a lot of Americans disagree with our government ’s unquestioning support of the state of Israel ’s actions . ”
Some 200 people protested outside the Oklahoma state capitol in Oklahoma City on Monday , chanting , “ Stop the killing , free , free Gaza ! ” Jillian Holzbauer of Stillwater , Oklahoma , a student at Oklahoma State University , carried a sign saying , “ This Jew supports peace in Palestine . ”
Holzbauer spent the past three summers working for a Palestinian nonprofit group in the West Bank .
She told a local newspaper , “ I saw that this is n’t really a religious issue , this is an issue about people who are living under military occupation for 40 years and they ’re in a very desperate situation . ”
Approximately 2,000 people rallied in San Jose , California , January 4 in a protest against the Israeli attack on Gaza .
According to one participant , posting on the Indybay.org web site , “ At one point during the protest , a Valley Transportation Authority bus stopped at the light and the driver yelled out , ‘ Free Palestine . ’
Many passing motorists honked in support of the protest . ”
Hundreds rallied in Toledo , Dayton and Cleveland last Friday against the Zionist onslaught .
Protests were held in Albuquerque , New Mexico , and Tucson , Arizona .
Opponents of the Israeli action protested in Binghamton , New York , Raleigh , North Carolina , Des Moines , Iowa , Bloomington , Indiana , and various towns in South Florida and Michigan .
Israel itself has been the scene of numerous protests , the largest by Israeli Arabs in the town of Sakhnin , where up to 150,000 people rallied .
Tel Aviv and Haifa have also witnessed sizable protests .
Ynetnews reported Tuesday that “ Hundreds of Jews and Arabs protested against the Israeli operation in Gaza ” in Jaffa , south of Tel Aviv .
In Jerusalem , 150 Arab students protested the attack on Gaza near Hebrew University .
Also on Tuesday , Israeli police arrested 10 students , out of some 500 protesting the military ’s actions at the University of Haifa .
Ynet reports , “ Wael Soued , one of the protesting students , claimed that the demonstration started as a quiet protest until provocations came from the Jewish students .
“ ‘ The objective was to have a quiet protest with signs and posters .
They started making derogatory statements towards us , and we answered back .
Within a few minutes , a big tumult broke out .
The police got involved with batons and people got hurt , ’ Soued recounted . ”
This is day one of our series on how to become a better developer in 30 days .
During this series , I will discuss during one month 30 ways for anyone to become a better developer .
Today , I would like to talk about something that few people do voluntarily : reading other peoples code .
Writing good code is the goal of most developers , but what we sometimes forget is that in order to become good writers we also need to be good readers .
This is just a reality that has been verified since elementary school , when we first learned to write our language by reading how other writers do their job .
Separating Good and Bad
What makes things a little more complicated for developers is the simple realization that there is huge amount of bad code out there .
In fact , without any fear of offending anyone , I can say that most code out there is BAD code .
By that , I do n’t mean just code that barely works , but also code that was not made for “ human consumption ” , usually as a result of being written under the time pressure to make a release possible .
While this is sadly the most frequent case ( for reasons that have mostly to do with the realities of the software industry ) , this does n’t mean that developers cannot find good examples of code to read .
In fact , I believe that just the opposite is the case .
For example , many available open source programs are written at a high quality level , and could very well be read just for the leaning experience .
The Linux kernel is certainly a case in point .
The whole kernel is really large , but the central routines are really well maintained and are in used by many schools as a live example of operating system internals .
Another case in point is software written as literate programs .
Literate programming is a term created by Knuth for programs that are written is a style similar to an essay .
In such a style , programming language code is secondary to the description of the algorithm in English .
Code enters the picture only as a concrete illustration of the comment section .
That code is later on be processed by literate programming tools and transformed into an executable artifact .
A classic example of literate program is the source of TeX , the typesetting software used by most mathematicians and computer scientists .
What to Look For
Whatever the style of the program you are reading , it is important to make sure that you are learning new techniques .
Thus , it is important to read programs with an objective , such as to understand a new programming paradigm , or to learn how to work well with a new API .
In these cases , reading code may be a much more efficient way of learning a topic than reading documentation .
One thing that I wished existed in the software development world is a catalog of software that would be interesting to read .
Most APIs come with some sample code , which usually is not enough to teach anything useful .
An alternative would be a resource where we could list good software to read if you want to learn a specific technique or concept .
For example , to learn how to write a kernel you can read the Linux kernel , or the MINIX .
What would be good sources to learn compilation techniques , or the inner working of a database ?
Let me know if you ever found a resource answering these questions .
Conclusion
To become good writers it is important to read what really works .
Sadly , developers do n’t take the time necessary to read what other people are doing .
What contributes to this issue is the problem that most code is of low quality .
I believe that despite this , it is still possible to find a lot of interesting code to read .
In the future , we might have a library of open source code that would be voted as great examples for each major technique and concept in software development .
I believe this is a fun and useful way to learn how to write better software .
Further Reading
The idea of literate programming was promoted by Knuth in his book Literate Programming .
The Linux kernel is a classic example of code that has been read for its own qualities .
Understanding the Linux Kernel is one of the many books that explore this fact .

I started my OB rotation last week .
I have to go to Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit .
It 's about an hour drive and we start at 6:30 am so I have to get up at 4:15 .
I am never gonna get used to that !
So far , it 's kind of boring but we have only worked in post partum .
I watched a circumcision ( wo n't do that again ) and gave a 9 hour old baby a shot .
Chase , had I watched a circumcision before you were born , I never would have done that to you .
My apologies .
Soon , we will get to see babies be born and even get to help a bit .
There are bout 15 - 20 babies born at this hospital every 24 hours so there should be enough births for everyone to help a couple times .
I feel for the young girls in my group who do n't have any children .
This rotation may just talk 'em right out of ever giving birth .
There are some things better left unknown .
Ignorance is bliss !
Norm Coleman 's lawyers all but conceded defeat Tuesday and promised to appeal after a panel of three judges ordered no more than 400 new absentee ballots opened and counted , far fewer than the Republican had sought to overcome the lead held by DFLer Al Franken .
The ballots include many that Franken had identified as wrongly rejected as well as ballots that Coleman wanted opened in his quest to overcome the 225 - vote lead that Franken gained after a recount in Minnesota 's U.S. Senate race .
" We are very pleased , " said Franken lead lawyer Marc Elias shortly after the ruling , which calls for ballots to be opened next week .
Coleman legal spokesman Ben Ginsberg acknowledged that the Republican may have lost the seven - week trial and was prepared to appeal to the Minnesota Supreme Court .
" It is pretty much of a long shot with that few ballots being put in play , " Ginsberg said , comparing the Republican 's odds of winning the trial to someone betting on the winning team in the NCAA basketball tournament .
" We are disappointed .
But we feel the court is wrong and we will appeal . "
The ruling is not a final order and it's not clear for which candidate the ballots were cast .
About half of them came from Hennepin , Ramsey and St. Louis Counties , which went heavily for Franken in the election .
But about 61 percent of the 400 ballots are from Republican - leaning suburbs of Hennepin County or counties that broke for Coleman .
The three - judge panel ordered the ballots delivered to the Secretary of State 's Office by April 6 and those deemed legal to be opened and counted April 7 in the Supreme Court room at the Minnesota Judicial Center .
The judges emphasized that fewer than the 400 absentee ballots might be counted if some of them are deemed ineligible upon further examination .
" To be clear , not every absentee ballot identified in this order will ultimately be opened and counted , " the panel wrote .
Some of the ballots lacked documentation needed for the panel to make an immediate finding .
That raised the possibility that the pool of new ballots available to Coleman could shrink further .
Moreover , about 50 of the 400 have previously been identified as coming from Franken supporters who took part in a separate legal action .
To be sure , the panel has yet to rule on other claims by Coleman that could provide him with additional votes .
His lawyers said missing ballots in Minneapolis wrongly netted Franken 44 votes , and that double - counting elsewhere in the city gave the DFLer scores of additional votes .
But absentee ballots rejected during and after the November election emerged early in the trial as the centerpiece of Coleman 's court challenge to Franken 's slim lead .
Strict standards Coleman said as many as 4,800 absentee ballots were wrongly rejected and should be counted .
But the judges quickly signaled that they were not persuaded by the argument .
In a critical ruling on Feb. 13 , they refused to consider many of those ballots .
That ruling changed the tenor of the trial .
At its conclusion , Coleman submitted only 1,369 new ballots for the judges to consider .
His legal team shifted gears , attacking the judges ' reasoning and raising constitutional arguments with an eye toward post - trial appeals .
Ginsberg said " the Friday the 13th ruling , " as he repeatedly called it , created a " legal quagmire " by excluding the kinds of ballots already tallied in the earlier recount .
On Tuesday Ginsberg recalled the panel 's earlier ruling and said , " Now their ' Almost April Fool 's Day ' order is equally wrong . "
In their latest order , the judges told Coleman that he failed to meet his burden to show that rejected ballots were legally cast .
" Each party knew or should have known the scope of the [ panel 's ] review " early in the trial , the judges wrote .
The judges rejected Coleman 's argument that they lighten up on enforcing the letter of the law and use " common sense " when deciding which ballots to count .
Coleman said other courts had held that voters only needed to " substantially comply " with election requirements , not strictly obey the statute .
For instance , the panel noted that Coleman 's lawyers " argued that a voter could not obtain an absentee ballot without first completing an absentee ballot application and that the court could presume the existence of the application . "
" The court was unwilling to make this presumption , " the panel said . " ... A party may not rely on presumptions to prove its case . "
" The Court carefully reviewed each absentee ballot on a ballot - by - ballot basis to determine whether sufficient individualized evidence had been presented that the voter complied with applicable federal and state law , " the judges wrote .
They required evidence that voters were properly registered , did n't vote in another way , had a qualified witness and used their genuine signature .
10 days to file appeal
After a final order is issued by the judges , possibly next week , the losing candidate has 10 days to appeal to the Minnesota Supreme Court .
Coleman 's lawyers have challenged the fairness of Minnesota 's election system .
They said outdated voter registration records disqualified eligible voters and local election officials applied different standards in counting ballots .
In an appeal , Coleman is expected to argue that the varied practices of county election officials and contradictory rulings by the three - judge panel violated rights to equal protection under the Constitution .
The Supreme Court has said all state appeals must be exhausted before a winner can be certified .
But Coleman has n't ruled out a federal appeal , which could delay a final resolution for additional months .
Ginsberg would not comment on whether the campaign might launch a separate federal court appeal .
But Texas Sen. John Cornyn , chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee , has recently said a legal battle could go on for years .
Brian Walsh , a spokesman for Cornyn , issued a statement Tuesday in support of Coleman : " The NRSC has and will continue to support Norm Coleman 's efforts to ensure that thousands of Minnesotans are not disenfranchised , that ballots exist before they are counted , and that every legitimate vote that was cast is counted once in Minnesota . "
In what 's possibly the meanest anti-Apple pun ever , Consumerist reader Ryan was sold an actual brick in a box instead of the MacBook Pro for which he paid over $ 2,000 .

He purchased the " MacBook Pro " at a Best Buy in Texas , and the retailer is citing the problem as Apple 's responsibility rather than its own .
The box was apparently sealed with the brick ( a paving stone , really , but I 've already eked two jokes out of calling it a brick and I refuse to let that kind of thing pass me by ) inside , which does seem like it would be a bizarre screwup on Apple 's end .
Ryan has n't gotten the mess sorted out with his credit card company , Best Buy , or Apple , but this is so ridiculous somebody 's bound to refund his money .

Following a mountain of bad publicity and strong objections from just about everyone except the entertainment industries , New Zealand 's proposed ' guilty upon accusation ' Section 92A anti-piracy law has been scrapped .
In 2008 , the New Zealand government passed ‘ 3 - strike ’ legislation which was designed to have alleged copyright infringers disconnected from the Internet .
Last month a code of practice was drafted by the music industry and ISPs which attempted to formalize how ISPs would go about disconnecting people .
However , after much discussion between the parties and outrage in the Internet community , no agreement was reached in the time frame allocated , and Prime Minister John Key announced that the law would be delayed while a solution was found .
Today things have gone stage further .
As it became clear that an agreement on a code of practice would not be reached even with a delay , the New Zealand government has scrapped the controversial Section 92A legislation .
“ Cabinet today decided that section 92A of the Copyright Act 1994 will not come into force on 27 March as scheduled , but will be amended to address areas of concern , ” said Minister for Commerce , Simon Power .
“ Allowing Section 92A to come into force in its current format would not be appropriate given the level of uncertainty around its operation , ” he added .
Prime Minister John Key said that although some progress was made between the entertainment industries and ISPs , there was not enough common ground to reach agreement .
“ Section 92A is not going to come into force as originally written .
We have now asked the minister of commerce [ Simon Power ] to start work on a replacement section , ” Key said .
Back in February , InternetNZ , the non-profit group responsible for protecting and promoting the Internet in New Zealand , called Section 92A “ faulty ” and “ disproportionate and unfit for purpose ” but today they are breathing a sigh of relief .
“ Terminating an Internet account was always a disproportionate response to copyright infringement and to force ISPs and other organizations to be copyright judges and policemen was never an acceptable situation , ” said InternetNZ executive chairman , Keith Davidson .
Meanwhile , users on Twitter expressed their delight at the news and no doubt the anti-Section 92A people over at ‘ Creative Freedom ‘ will be delighted that all their hard work has paid off .
The question now remains – will Section 92A be rewritten completely , or will the government stick a couple of Band - Aids on it and hope for the best ?

TIM GEITHNER has not had an easy time of it , but he is probably too busy to dwell on his tribulations .
Three days after unveiling a plan to cleanse banks of their troubled loans and securities , America 's treasury secretary was back in front of a congressional committee outlining proposals to extend the government 's grip on the financial system .
These would mark the biggest expansion of federal regulation since the 1930s .
The new framework has four parts : containing systemic risks ; protecting consumers and investors ; streamlining the regulatory structure ; and international co-ordination .
Mr Geithner had little to say about the last three , promising details in the coming weeks .
Instead he focused on systemic risk , in part because that will be a focus of discussion at the G20 summit in London next week — and European countries have been pressing the Americans to tackle the issue — but also because the Obama government itself sees it as the priority in the wake of Lehman Brothers ' failure and the messy rescue of American International Group ( AIG ) .
Mr Geithner urged Congress to help him enact “ new rules of the game ” , not “ repairs at the margin ” .
His priorities are twofold .
First , the government needs the authority to take over troubled non-banks whose failure could destabilise markets and to wind them down in an orderly way by selling assets , renegotiating contracts and so on .
It is largely because it lacked such power that the AIG bail - out has been a fiasco .
The Treasury , which has financial heft , suggests sharing this authority with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , which has experience handling failed banks .
The other pressing issue is the creation of a “ systemic - risk regulator ” .
This would help to police large financial firms of all stripes and keep a lookout for emerging dangers across the system , such as the shoddy loan underwriting and credit bubble that helped to cause this crisis .
Government officials want the Federal Reserve to take the job on , but its central role in the AIG scandal has weakened its credentials in congressional eyes .
One way to strengthen the system , Mr Geithner believes , is to force banks to plump up their capital cushions .
They should do this “ counter - cyclically ” , building up their defences in good times so they have more protection against losses in downturns , thus dampening rather than amplifying credit cycles .
The rules currently work the other way , allowing banks to sail closer to the wind when times are good .
For the first time , the administration also plans to throw a regulatory net over non-bank pools of capital , such as hedge funds .
They may not have caused the crisis , contrary to fears beforehand ; indeed , they have been hurt more by the demise of banks and investment banks than the other way round .
Nevertheless , the government wants all funds over a certain size to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission and provide it with more information about their assets and leverage .
The very largest , if deemed systemically important , could become subject to “ stringent ” capital requirements .
These rules may be extended to money - market funds — a huge and supposedly stable industry that wobbled alarmingly after Lehman 's fall .
The last plank of the proposed systemic framework is stronger oversight of derivatives , such as the credit - default swaps that detonated within AIG .
Those that are traded over the counter ( away from exchanges ) will face federal regulation , and supervision of dealers will be tightened .
To cut “ counterparty risk ” , all standardised over - the - counter contracts will have to be cleared through a central entity .
Firms are already jostling to win this business .
“ The days when a major insurance company could bet the house on credit - default swaps with no one watching and no credible backing … must end , ” said Mr Geithner in his testimony .
Many details remain to be hammered out .
It is not clear , for example , who would pay the costs of handling bust non-banks ; one idea is to charge a fee to all firms deemed systemically important .
Some question whether a risk regulator would really be able to do much about looming dangers it identifies in good times , when everyone else is too busy enjoying themselves .
Moreover , the politics of regulatory reform are sure to be messy — and most of the government 's proposals require legislation .
There is also a debate to be had about where regulation needs to be tougher , and where it should simply be smarter .
As Mr Geithner acknowledged , “ there were failures where regulation was extensive and failures where it was absent . ”
Banks , after all , blew up spectacularly despite being covered in red tape .
Nevertheless , this week 's proposals make clear that the accent for years to come will be on re-regulation more than innovation .
For the past quarter of a century , politicians and regulators stood back from financial markets , trusting them to set their own tolerance for risk .
They are now wading back in .
Technology.am ( Apr. 20 , 2009 ) — The U.S. military has enlisted the Apple ’s iPod Touch , the new battlefield weapon , which is becoming a valuable battlefield tool for soldiers , according to a report in Newsweek .
The iPod allows soldiers to be linked with other soldiers as well as intelligence resources , such as aerial images from drones and translation software .
Now soldiers can use apps to add translated phrases to maps and photos , as well as show villagers video messages from local leaders .
A new program called Vcommunicator translates spoken and written Arabic , Kurdish , as well as two Afghan languages .
i Phone has developed another application allowing soldiers to take a photo of a street sign , upload it and instantly receive intelligence on the local area , such as water and sympathizers .
New recruits are already familiar with how the iPod and iPhone work , it ’s also easier to train soldiers on loading content , the report notes .
The movie treatment of his novel , “ Angels and Demons , ” is cleaning up at the box office this week .
The sequel to “ The DaVinci Code , ” due out in November , might buoy the publishing industry through the recession .
And if you want to understand the state of American religion , you need to understand why so many people love Dan Brown .
It is n’t just that he knows how to keep the pages turning .
That ’s what it takes to sell a million novels .
But if you want to sell a 100 million , you need to preach as well as entertain  to present a fiction that can be read as fact , and that promises to unlock the secrets of history , the universe and God along the way .
Brown is explicit about this mission .
He is n’t a serious novelist , but he ’s a deadly serious writer :
His thrilling plots , he ’s said , are there to make the books ’ didacticism go down easy , so that readers do n’t realize till the end “ how much they are learning along the way . ”
He ’s working in the same genre as Harlan Coben and James Patterson , but his real competitors are ideologues like Ayn Rand , and spiritual gurus like Eckhart Tolle and Deepak Chopra .
He ’s writing thrillers , but he ’s selling a theology .
Brown ’s message has been called anti-Catholic , but that ’s only part of the story .
True , his depiction of the Roman Church ’s past constitutes a greatest hits of anti-Catholicism , with slurs invented by 19th - century Protestants jostling for space alongside libels fabricated by 20th - century Wiccans .
( If he targeted Judaism or Islam this way , one suspects that no publisher would touch him . )

Undercover BBC reporters filmed a transaction with Saurabh Sachar A criminal gang selling UK credit card details stolen from Indian call centres has been exposed by an undercover BBC News investigation .
Reporters posing as fraudsters bought UK names , addresses and valid credit card details from a Delhi - based man .
The seller denied any wrongdoing and Symantec corporation , from whom three victims bought a product via a call centre , called the incident " isolated " .
Card fraud totalled £ 609 m during 2008 , according to payments group Apacs .
Symantec said it requires rigorous security measures of any third - party call centre agents and it believed the breach had been limited to a single agent .
The BBC team went to India on a tip off after being put in touch with a man offering to sell stolen credit and debit card details .
Two undercover reporters met the broker in a Delhi coffee shop for an encounter that was filmed secretly .

He told the pair he could supply them with hundreds of credit and debit card details each week at a cost of $ 10 dollars a card .
After the reporters agreed to initially buy the details of 50 cards , the man handed over a list of 14 .
He said the remainder would be sent later by e-mail .
The man claimed some of the numbers had been obtained from call centres handling mobile phone sales , or payments for phone bills .
CARD FRAUD PRECAUTIONS
Customer should initiate contact - if bank contacts them , customer should arrange to call back on official number Use different passwords for different accounts , and routinely change passwords Avoid disclosing personal details , such as family names and birthdays , on social networking websites Advice on avoiding card scams available from Card Watch
Q&A : Card fraud Back in the UK , the broker continued to supply card details to one of the undercover reporters by email .
Nearly all of the names , addresses and post codes sold to the BBC team were valid .
But most of the numbers attached to them were invalid - often out by a single digit .
However , about one in seven of the numbers purchased were valid - active cards still in use by UK customers .
Their owners could have been subjected to fraud if these cards had fallen into the hands of criminals .
The BBC team contacted the owners of these cards and warned them that their details were now being bought and sold in India .
Three of those customers had , within hours of each other , bought a computer software package by giving their credit card details to a call centre over the phone .
Within hours of making the purchase , their details were fraudulently sent on to the reporters .
One of the victims said he was " disturbed " at what had happened .

The software was made by Norton , which is part of the Symantec corporation .
Symantec , which launched an investigation after being informed of the the undercover probe , said the leak had come from a single source which has now been removed .
In a statement it said : " We are investigating how this incident happened and will take any appropriate steps to address any opportunities for improvement in our processes .
" We have engaged with the local law enforcement officials in India and will cooperate fully with that investigation .
We are in the process of reviewing all possible options to manage this third party call centre , including moving away from it . "
A spokeswoman stressed that " rigorous security measures " are put in place at call centres .
For example , staff are not allowed to take electronic devices , memory sticks , pens or pencils to their desks .
Internet and email access is also banned .
Wrongdoing denied Saurabh Sachar , the seller , denied any wrongdoing or illegal activity .
When told that he had been filmed taking money from undercover reporters , he said they had borrowed that money from him and were paying it back .
He said the piece of paper handed over to undercover reporters contained " some directions " and a " kind of balance sheet " .
And , when accused of providing credit card details he said they were " not correct " .
Mr Sachar also denied sending more details by e-mail .
Credit and debit card fraud cost the UK banking industry £ 609 million in 2008 - a rise of 14 % on 2007 .
Much of that fraud comes from transactions where the card is not physically present , such as telephone or internet sales .
The UK and the EU have stringent Data Protection laws .
India has recently tightened up its rules governing the use of Information technology , but it has no data protection legislation .
" India is only paying lip service to data protection , " the Data Protection lawyer Pavan Duggal told BBC News .
" We do n't yet have a dedicated legislation on data protection .
Until such times as India comes across with strong stringent provisions on data security we will have instances like this keep on happening . "
The huge expansion in credit card use in recent years has produced a new kind of fraudster - one that will try to exploit any opportunity to reach into almost any credit or debit account that is used to make telephone purchases .

I have a friend who 's working in D.C. on health care reform , and she added some context to that " people are happy with the insurance they have " claim that 's bandied about .
She says their focus groups show that when people say that , they mean they do n't want to have to fill out a lot of paperwork the way their parents have to do with Medicare - ever since the pharmaceutical companies took control a few years ago .
( As someone who 's watched her mother struggle with the Plan D paperwork , I know exactly what they mean . )
They 're saying given a choice between what they already have and know , and some unknown plan that requires a lot of paperwork , they 'll stick with the devil they know .
It means they want a simple , easy - to - use benefit - in other words , single payer .
It certainly does n't mean they 're " happy " with their insurance , as this exchange from yesterday shows ( h/t DC Blogger ) :
Steve McArthur is a management consultant .
Read self - employed .
That means he has to buy his own insurance , a Blue Cross Blue Shield policy that costs him $ 584 a month and carries a $ 10,000 deductible .
On Tuesday morning , he listened for a long time as Missoulians discussed health care reform at a listening session at St. Patrick Hospital sponsored by U.S. Sen .
Max Baucus , D - Mont .
The hearing ranged broadly over the possibilities for reform , but what clearly resonated for McArthur was something Baucus ' chief of staff , Jon Selib , said a couple of times .
Discussing why a single - payer system of health insurance was n't viable , Selib made reference to the more than 150 million Americans who are covered by some sort of employer - provided health care .
“ A lot of people like that , ” Selib said .
When the time came for questions , McArthur stood up and asked a simple question .
Looking across a standing - room - only crowd of about 275 , he asked how many were happy with their employer - based health insurance .
Less than 10 people raised their hands .
“ The number is bogus , ” McArthur said .
“ It 's not working for 95 percent of us . ” McArthur drew resounding applause .
In fact , any mention of single - payer health care insurance brought raucous cheers and clapping .
Any other solution to health care reform - including Baucus ' “ balanced ” plan that would create a mix of public and private plans - was received more coolly .
Tuesday 's session was one of a handful of events Baucus is sponsoring around the state this week .
He chairs the Senate 's powerful Finance Committee , and is the point man on health care reform .
He did not attend Tuesday 's meeting , but Selib did , and he heard what the senator himself has heard since he announced that single - payer was n't really on the table .
As Selib worked to massage that point , one man barked out , “ Oh bull ----. ” Tom Roberts , president of the Western Montana Clinic and moderator at the session , asked the crowd to be civil , but the man had made his point .
I wonder what Max Baucus means by health care " reform . "
( Personally , I think forcing people to buy private insurance they can't afford during a global economic crisis is a stunningly awesome plan - but I 'm a little twisted that way . )
My weekly technology law column ( Toronto Star version , homepage version ) focuses on the U.S. decision to elevate Canada to the Priority Watch list .
I note that the elevation will undoubtedly heighten pressure for reforms , it also points to the need for the Canadian government to reassess how it manages the Special 301 process and its bilateral relationship with the U.S. on this issue .
In previous years , Canadian officials have done little more than express disappointment with the U.S. findings .
According to documents obtained under the Access to Information Act , the Minister of Foreign Affairs has been repeatedly advised that " Canada does not recognize the Special 301 process due to its lacking of reliable and objective analysis , and we have raised this issue regularly with the U.S. in our bilateral discussions . "
Raising the issue in bilateral discussions may have worked in the past , but this year 's report sends a clear signal that more is needed .
This year 's designation is so unsupportable that Industry Minister Tony Clement and Canadian Heritage Minister James Moore should not hesitate to challenge both the process and the substance of the findings .
From a substantive perspective , it would be worth reminding U.S. officials that Canada is compliant with its international copyright obligations .
In recent years , it responded to U.S. pressure by becoming one of the few countries to enact anti-camcording legislation .
The RCMP has prioritized intellectual property cases and the law contains tough statutory damages provisions that are regularly used by rights holders to obtain significant judgments .
In fact , some of Canada 's copyright rules are more restrictive than those found south of the border .
Moreover , grouping Canada together with high - piracy nations does not stand up to even mild scrutiny .
The Business Software Alliance 's 2008 statistics show that among the eleven other countries on this year 's Priority Watch List for which data is available , the lowest rate of software piracy is 66 percent .
By comparison , Canada stands at 32 percent , not remotely close to any other country on the list .
In fact , Canada 's software piracy rate is lower than all 46 countries named in the Special 301 report .
Similarly , 2008 data from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency on intellectual property seizures reports that Taiwan and South Korea rank fourth and fifth as sources of seized goods ( China is number one ) , yet both were dropped this year from the Watch List .
By comparison , Canada does not even appear in the rankings .
Officials should not sit idly by as the U.S. unfairly tarnishes Canada 's reputation .
This year twenty countries submitted briefs to the U.S. defending their laws and policies .
Some sought removal from the list , a few pointed to inaccuracies in the lobby group claims , and several provided detailed accounts of their anti-counterfeiting activities ( Indonesia even included photos of police burning pirated discs ) .
Canada can no longer afford to miss the opportunity to set the record straight .
Moreover , in light of the Priority Watch List ranking , Canada should reconsider its consistent support for U.S. positions on the international intellectual property stage .
Canada was an original participant in negotiating the controversial Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement and supported the U.S. in its World Trade Organization copyright complaint against China .
In both instances , officials had some misgivings , but decided to stand with the U.S. to strengthen the relationship with its largest trading partner .
The U.S. has now sent a message that this support is not good enough .
Canadian law may be in need of reform , but new laws should come on our terms and in our national interest , not as a result of misleading and inaccurate bully tactics .

I want to talk about Bilderberg 2009 .
But beyond a simple " yes , it 's happening , it 's real , the leaders of the world are hanging out here for the weekend " , what can I say ?
It 's a private meeting .
I do n't know if they 're discussing global financial unification or the season finale of Grey 's Anatomy over their prawn cocktails .
I do n't even know what the vegetarian option is for starters .
Butternut squash ?
You 're going to have to forgive me for speculating , but that 's all I can do .
I 'm not a proper reporter .
I do n't have the foggiest of my rights ( if any ) to stand on public footpaths and point cameras .
I do n't even have a proper camera .
But what I do have is this : a sense of something rotten in the state of Greece .
To my nose , there 's not a healthy smell wafting down from the Astir Palace .
Or maybe that was the egg and pepper roll I had for breakfast .
Sorry if some of these speculations are wrongheaded , but I 'm doing a lot of this thinking for the first time and I 've only just shaken off my police escort .
Sorry if I sound shrill or petulant , self - righteous or precious , sorry if my perceptions have been tilted by anger … sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry .
Sorry for bothering you Mr Bilderberg .
I 've spent the last three days apologising to everyone .
Sorry to the staff at my hotel for having plainclothes officers loafing around in their lobby .
Sorry to the plainclothes officers themselves for having to drag them around Vougliameni on a wild goose chase ( I bought them some chilled water , and took it to them while they shuffled awkwardly behind a tree ) .
Sorry then to the desk sergeant for bothering her with my predicament : " I 'm being followed around like a criminal , I wonder if you would n't mind asking them to stop ?
I 'm not doing anything wrong , and it 's getting … well … a bit annoying . "
I 'm going to stop apologising now .
I 'm going to try and make sense of my experiences .
It 's not easy ; I do n't want to sound feeble - minded , but this has been a lot to take in .
I feel a bit like I 've driven down the wrong alley and suddenly do n't recognise anything , and people are staring at me and not simply to admire my hair .
I 'm jumpy .
I think someone has been in my room and moved my laptop .
I know this sounds bonkers , I know it does , but I took a photo of it before I left the room and it was n't where I left it .
Listen to me .
I sound like a fruitcake .
Three days and I 've been turned into a suspect , a troublemaker , unwanted , ill at ease , tired and a bit afraid .
And I have n't even walked up the road to the Bilderberg hotel since the whole " get in the car ! " incident .
I 've been trying to stay out of trouble , but trouble has followed me down the hill .
So – to make sense of it .
I 'm going to begin here : with the face of the first Bilderberg delgate I saw in the flesh .
I was trying , lamely , to get a snap of some delegates as they swooshed through Vougliameni in their mirrored limos with their plainclothes motorcycle outriders and police escorts .
And one of them had their window open .
I was so excited I forgot to bring the camera to my face and took a photo of the hubcap .
What I saw I wo n't forget .
It was a 40 - something man with his head thrown back , laughing and laughing , the perfect photograph that only my retina will ever see .
And you know what : no wonder he was happy .
It must be WAY COOL to be sirened through Greek streets in the back of bulletproof limo on your way to the COOLEST party in the world .
You 've been invited by the coolest of the cool kids to hang out for the weekend .
Your cool cousin 's über - cool older brother and his way cool friends have got a keg of beer and a pool in the yard , and their parents are away and you think Jessica might be going .
THIS IS THE BEST PARTY EVER !
Turn on the sirens !
We 're coming through !
Woohoo !
And your life is already pretty cool .
You already own a newspaper or head a thinktank , or you 're the UK secretary of state for business , enterprise and regulatory reform , or you run Fiat , or you 're chairman of the Federal Reserve or Queen of the Netherlands , or president of Shell Oil .
You run stuff .
You have big ideas .
You 're in control , and control is fun .
Bilderberg is all about control .
It 's about " what shall we do next ? "
We run lots of stuff already , how about we run some more ?
How about we make it easier to run stuff ?
More efficient .
Efficiency is good .
It would be so much easier with a single bank , a single currency , a single market , a single government .
How about a single army ?
That would be pretty cool .
We would n't have any wars then .
This prawn cocktail is GOOD .
How about a single way of thinking ?
How about a controlled internet ?
How about not .
I am so unbelievably backteeth sick of power being flexed by the few .
I 've had it flexed in my face for three days , and it 's up my nose like a wasp .
I do n't care whether the Bilderberg Group is planning to save the world or shove it in a blender and drink the juice , I do n't think politics should be done like this .
This might be a facile point , but if they were organising a charity snooker league , they could do it upstairs at Starbucks .
If they were trying to cure cancer they could do it with the lights on .
Innocent thoughts can be minuted .
Or maybe they 're simply swingers .
Maybe that 's why the curtains are drawn .
Imagine chucking your key in the tub and pulling out Ken Clarke .
Sorry Timothy Geithner , that 's the cost of doing business .
I have a confession .
( I 'm not a swinger , that 's not it . )
My confession is that being tailed today by Greek special branch , and doubling back through a cafe and catching them out , and buying them chilled water on a hot day like in Beverley Hills Cop , when Eddie Murphy has room service sent to their car – all this was pretty exciting .
It 's was my own little episode of the Equaliser .
( The Greequaliser ?
No , really no , I 'm tired ) .
Being tailed was exciting and funny and absurd and confusing and terrifying and utterly , utterly wrong .
And I know this sounds pathetic but I got a bit teary in the police station when I was telling the nice desk sergeant lady that I 'm not a bad person and not a threat to anyone , and it would be nice if someone could call off the goons .
I do n't like to be made to feel like this .
I 've been " put " in this position , and I have n't deserved it .
Bilderberg is about positions of control .
I get within half a mile of it , and suddenly I 'm one of the controlled .
I 'm followed , watched , logged , detained , detained again .
I 'd been put in that position by the " power " that was up the road .
Likewise , the Bilderberg delegates occupy a position of power over the bobbing ignorance of the people patting beach balls in the sea , and me with my crappy little camera and my curiosity and my ill - formed sense of citizenship .
I may not be very good at bearing witness here , but I 'm doing my best .
I have n't shinned over the fence and shoved a camera in David Rockefeller 's face but I do n't want to be shot in the forehead .
A final thought for the day .
In the fable , the men may have been blind but they did at least get to grope the elephant before trying to describe it .
Now shove that elephant in the back of a blacked - out Mercedes S600 , whisk it off into a luxury Greek resort , circle it with heavily armed guards and helicopters , hand it a Martini , and pay the local police to harass , detain and follow anyone showing even the slightest interest of grabbing a flank .
That , my friend , is the beast that is Bilderberg 2009 .
Shader Smith is part of a growing trend of workers who have gone from regular full - time jobs to contract work — or freelancing .
They may not all be happy about it — but at least it 's a way to keep working and maintain some income .
For some , it also may be the best way to find a permanent job .
At the same time , contract workers are becoming a permanent fixture in the economy that is likely to continue even after the recession is over .
" I think we are seeing a fundamental change , " says Tom Mobley , a professor of the Farmer School of Business at Miami University in Ohio .
" Companies will staff up at certain levels again , but I think they will use freelancers or consultants on a regular basis going forward . "
The recession clearly has prompted the rapid growth of freelancing in a wide variety of professions .
Friday 's employment report showed that the number of people forced to work part - time for " economic reasons " rose by 423,000 in March , to 9 million .
And a new study by the Human Capital Institute showed that one third of the US workforce is now comprised of non-traditional " contract " workers .
The study says the pool of part time workers is growing at more than twice the rate of the regular workforce .
Other Stories From CNBC.com
Cash - strapped American companies are taking advantage of the situation .
More than 90 percent of US firms use contract talent , with spending on them doubling in the past six years , to more than $ 120 billion .
It 's a trend that experts in the field say will continue even as the economy recovers .
" It 's a paradigm shift , " says Dennis Nason , CEO of Nason and Nason , an executive search firm based in Coral Gables , Florida .
" Contractors have been used by companies successfully , and it's changed the relationship between worker and management . "
According to Elance , an online site that connects businesses with freelance professionals , the skills most required from freelancers are :
There ’s an amusing dust - up going on in one of the discussion threads in the Nature Network discussion forums .
The thread is entitled Scientists who blog .
The founder of the thread began with the somewhat inflammatory assertion that successful scientists have better things to do , provoking the predictable reactions .
Unfortunately , as forum users ( including several science bloggers , e.g. , Heather Etchevers , Antony Williams , and Bob O’Hara ) weighed in with their opinions , the forum moderator started removing comments at a truly astonishing pace — e.g. see this page — making the thread basically impossible to follow , since many later comments are responses to earlier comments that are no longer visible .
Several users ( including myself ) complained about the hyperactive moderation , prompting the moderator herself to reply and justify the removals .
One of the troubling things about the justifications is that they present a rapidly moving target : from the idea that the removed posts were offensive , to the idea that they violated the site ’s terms of use but that there were other fora available on the Nature Network site where different standards of moderation might apply .
Meanwhile , the moderator asserted , “ All the comments that are relevant to the question remain , ” a statement now impossible to verify ( and which , for the record , I flatly do n’t believe ; I also do n’t see how all of these statements can be simultaneously true ) .
I have a bee in my bonnet about this case for several reasons :
All too often , people confuse disagreement with offense .
Different points of view may be difficult to hear , but that ’s the cost of doing business in a free forum .
Similarly , people confuse “ being offended ” with the genuinely , objectively offensive ( for an eloquent paragraph on this distinction , see this comment from the thread ) ; while we might wish to regulate the latter , it ’s in the interest of free exchange to avoid interfering with the former .
Since I find it hard to believe that the removed comments involved racial epithets , hate speech or exhortations to violence , I ’m forced to conclude that the moderator overreacted .
Implicit in the moderator ’s removal of comments is the idea that a legitimate exchange of scholarly views is necessarily not “ offensive ” .
This is absurd : to the exact extent that a subject is important , it ’s likely to stir powerful emotions , which as I point out above can often be confused for “ offensiveness . ”
It ’s inconsistent :
The moderator herself suggested that different standards for moderation might exist on different discussion threads moderated by different people .
There should be a huge presumption against removing a user ’s comment ; if the moderator herself could acknowledge that a different standard might reasonably apply elsewhere on the same site , this is itself sufficient grounds to avoid taking a step as drastic as deletion .
Scientists are grownups .
We can police ourselves , and we do n’t need a forum moderator to stand in loco parentis as though were were children on the playground .
There are certainly ways for reader - driven moderation to allow the thin - skinned avoid offensive comments without removing them entirely from the view of those who want to dig deeper — see e.g. the user - driven moderation and open posting policy on Slashdot , where every comment permanently “ exists ” but in a way that allows a given user to choose their own level of risk of exposure to offensive content ( or irrelevancies , or idiocies ) .
This is important largely because Nature Network wants to become a ( if not the ) major forum for public discussions on a wide variety of scientifically significant topics .
Yes , it ’s “ just ” a forum , but it ’s also part of the larger revolution in the use of Web 2.0 - based methods to increase the volume , accessibility , and quality of scientific exchange .
The tone set here will cast a long shadow over the way we handle similar situations in the future .
Moderating the exchange of ideas between scientists , especially on the grounds of “ offensiveness ” , is potentially toxic to free exchange .
It is our hope that someday public fora other user - driven content will nurture and democratize scientifici exchanges between the greatest minds on Earth .
Do we really want to place the future of scientific communication in the hands of forum moderators ?
I decided at the beginning of May , that I wanted to look for ways to save money each day this month .
Finding ways to save money is a fun game when you set your mind on it !
We often say to ourselves that we want to save money , but implementing is often the hard part .
Turn it into a daily challenge and you ’ll find it ’s easier to tackle .
A third of the way through the month , and here ’s a different savings idea from each day in May .
We ’ll see if I can keep it going all month !

Seal wore a fake mullet and an American flag jacket while Heidi wore her hair in cornrows and donned a lace wedding gown .
Heidi and Seal were first married in May 2005 .
Cadaeic Cadenza A Pilish short story
Mike Keith , 1996
One
A Poem
A Raven
Midnights so dreary , tired and weary ,
Silently pondering volumes extolling all by - now obsolete lore .
During my rather long nap - the weirdest tap !
An ominous vibrating sound disturbing my chamber 's antedoor .
" This " , I whispered quietly , " I ignore " .
Perfectly , the intellect remembers : the ghostly fires , a glittering ember .
Inflamed by lightning 's outbursts , windows cast penumbras upon this floor .
Sorrowful , as one mistreated , unhappy thoughts I heeded :
That inimitable lesson in elegance - Lenore -
Is delighting , exciting ... nevermore .
Ominously , curtains parted ( my serenity outsmarted ) ,
And fear overcame my being - the fear of " forevermore " .
Fearful foreboding abided , selfish sentiment confided ,
As I said , " Methinks mysterious traveler knocks afore .
A man is visiting , of age threescore . "
Taking little time , briskly addressing something : " Sir , " ( robustly )
" Tell what source originates clamorous noise afore ?
Disturbing sleep unkindly , is it you a - tapping , so slyly ?
Why , devil incarnate !--"
Here completely unveiled I my antedoor --
Just darkness , I ascertained - nothing more .
While surrounded by darkness then , I persevered to clearly comprehend .
I perceived the weirdest dream ... of everlasting " nevermores " .
Quite , quite , quick nocturnal doubts fled - such relief ! - as my intellect said ,
( Desiring , imagining still ) that perchance the apparition was uttering a whispered " Lenore " .
This only , as evermore .
Silently , I reinforced , remaining anxious , quite scared , afraid ,
While intrusive tap did then come thrice - O , so stronger than sounded afore .
" Surely " ( said silently ) " it was the banging , clanging window lattice . "
Glancing out , I quaked , upset by horrors hereinbefore ,
Perceiving : a " nevermore " .
Completely disturbed , I said , " Utter , please , what prevails ahead .
Repose , relief , cessation , or but more dreary ' nevermores ' ? "
The bird intruded thence - O , irritation ever since ! -
Then sat on Pallas ' pallid bust , watching me ( I sat not , therefore ) ,
And stated " nevermores " .
Bemused by raven 's dissonance , my soul exclaimed , " I seek intelligence ;
Explain thy purpose , or soon cease intoning forlorn ' nevermores ' ! "
" Nevermores " , winged corvus proclaimed - thusly was a raven named ?
Actually maintain a surname , upon Pluvious seashore ?
I heard an oppressive " nevermore " .
My sentiments extremely pained , to perceive an utterance so plain ,
Most interested , mystified , a meaning I hoped for .
" Surely , " said the raven 's watcher , " separate discourse is wiser .
Therefore , liberation I 'll obtain , retreating heretofore -
Eliminating all the ' nevermores ' " .
Still , the detestable raven just remained , unmoving , on sculptured bust .
Always saying " never " ( by a red chamber 's door ) .
A poor , tender heartache maven - a sorrowful bird - a raven !
O , I wished thoroughly , forthwith , that he'd fly heretofore .
Still sitting , he recited " nevermores " .
The raven 's dirge induced alarm - " nevermore " quite wearisome .
I meditated : " Might its utterances summarize of a calamity before ? "
O , a sadness was manifest - a sorrowful cry of unrest ;
" O , " I thought sincerely , " it 's a melancholy great - furthermore ,
Removing doubt , this explains ' nevermores ' " .
Seizing just that moment to sit - closely , carefully , advancing beside it ,
Sinking down , intrigued , where velvet cushion lay afore .
A creature , midnight - black , watched there - it studied my soul , unawares .
Wherefore , explanations my insight entreated for .
Silently , I pondered the " nevermores " .
" Disentangle , nefarious bird !
Disengage - I am disturbed ! "
Intently its eye burned , raising the cry within my core .
" That delectable Lenore - whose velvet pillow this was , heretofore ,
Departed thence , unsettling my consciousness therefore .
She 's returning - that maiden - aye , nevermore . "
Since , to me , that thought was madness , I renounced continuing sadness .
Continuing on , I soundly , adamantly forswore :
" Wretch , " ( addressing blackbird only ) " fly swiftly - emancipate me ! "
" Respite , respite , detestable raven - and discharge me , I implore ! "
A ghostly answer of : " nevermore " .
" ' Tis a prophet ?
Wraith ?
Strange devil ?
Or the ultimate evil ? "
" Answer , tempter - sent creature ! " , I inquired , like before .
" Forlorn , though firmly undaunted , with ' nevermores ' quite indoctrinated ,
Is everything depressing , generating great sorrow evermore ?
I am subdued ! " , I then swore .
In answer , the raven turned - relentless distress it spurned .
" Comfort , surcease , quiet , silence ! " - pleaded I for .
" Will my ( abusive raven ! ) sorrows persist unabated ?
Nevermore Lenore respondeth ? " , adamantly I encored .
The appeal was ignored .
" O , satanic inferno's denizen -- go ! " , I said boldly , standing then .
" Take henceforth loathsome " nevermores " - O , to an ugly Plutonian shore !
Let nary one expression , O bird , remain still here , replacing mirth .
Promptly leave and retreat ! " , I resolutely swore .
Blackbird 's riposte : " nevermore " .
So he sitteth , observing always , perching ominously on these doorways .
Squatting on the stony bust so untroubled , O therefore .
Suffering stark raven 's conversings , so I am condemned , subserving ,
To a nightmare cursed , containing miseries galore .
Thus henceforth , I 'll rise ( from a darkness , a grave ) -- nevermore !
-- Allanpoe , E .

Change
My customary bedtime reading book hastily shelved , I sat , bewildered , pondering Allanpoe 's poetry .
" Something 's wrong " , I murmured .
" Despite Ravenesque timbres , so mesmerizing ( the echo
' nevermore
nevermore
nevermore
nevermore
nevermore
nevermore
...'
survives , for example ) , my intellect detects wrongful alteration .
This imitation , simulated Raven !... "
I recognized large , arbitrary changes .
" Odd " , I thought .
" Why ? "
To research , I headed downstairs , muttering softly , " Hmm " .
I hastened below carefully , there revisiting my book room .
Books inhabited each table , shelf , and nook .
Taking Cambridge Literature Treasury and proceeding to " Poetry , Poe's " , my fears - oh my God ! - heightened .
Sighting no Raven but The Dark Bird , severe distress arose .
" Absolutely , The Raven is maimed ! " , I exclaimed .
" How ? ! "
Immediately arriving upstairs , I posited a conspiracy : a literature alteration conspiracy .
" Are , " I did quietly question , " all writings changed ? "
Three
Of Carrolls
Jabwocky
Slithy toves , borogove
Gimbled there all out in strathwabe
Mimified and gyrified ,
A rath is outergrabe .
" Beware a scrunch , a scratch , stepson !
Beware Jubjub , withstand a word !
Respect the Jabberwock and dread
Manxomian songbird ! "
He , sword off hand , placement maintained
Thus to complete father 's grand quest -
Then waited , vaunting showily
His progenitor 's crest .
Therewith three swords he animized ,
Before the creature , rumbling .
It was alive ; its feelers straight
Burbled while whiffling !
The vorpall sword o' vulcanite
Smote - snicker !
snacker !
- artfully
A headless Wocky residue
Yielded strength mournfully .
" Youth did it - O , praised fearlessness ! "
He issued melodies , forthright .
" Death 's strike !
O , day !
Strallough !
Stralleigh ! " -
A - chortling in delight .
Borogove , strange slithy troves ,
A brilligtime quickstep
Mimsy creatures , gimblified ,
Frolicked on a steppe .

An Hypothesis
I exhausted Carroll 's rewritten ode , Jabwocky , soliciting essential clues to fully explain my difficulty .
" A Heisenberg Twinge could have modified books ' contents thusly , but ( my dubious thinking declared ) surely these mutations are willed .
I could sit and research a quantity of poetry 's excellent , famous passages , or try uncovering the structures . "
I therefore chose to scrutinize the words , and deliberate .
I pondered games of alphabets , verses , language , sentences , equations , words .
Lifting feather and inking it , my quill carefully scribbled thus :
A few schemata involving linguistical play
Lipograms : Writing so a letter 's missing
Haiku :
An uncommon ode ( poem ) bearing eccentric metrification characteristics
A Cento : Quite strange poem ; borrowed lines
Anagram :
To turn an item ( words ) into a novel expression
Double - entendres : Words , dualistic sense
Palindrome : Forwards or backwards , words are not transformed ( " Redraw , detooted warder ! " )
A pangram :
An amazing sentence , using whole alphabet
Acrostic : Inspected vertically , letters spell additional statement
Mnemonic : Can remember a factoid using this device
Pun : Groaner ( " Stop , pundit ! " )
Thus utilizing the plumelike pen , I hesitated .
" To cause these variations surely insinuates much diabolical , innovative ingenuity .
My poetry 's clearly overturned ; I cannot , however , rationalize .
The [ repeating ] diabolical , innovative ingenuity !
Although most beguiled , actually I 'm near exhaustion .
I am defeated , quite defeated , and undone ! " , I yelled .
Truthfully , the eerie enigma was greatly intriguing .
Reading afresh Raven 's discourses , I considered many options - a palindrome , a mnemonic , a conundrum .
" Full of mysteries , these poems crave observant review , " I announced .
Thoughts involving rest stayed , however , slowly causing lethargy .
" Now , " ( quietly said ) " this sojourner will seek serenity .
To bring sleep , the Musical Anthology usually renders help . "
Turning to " Poetry , Anderson " , thus emerged a remarkable poem suggesting Jon 's musical group , Yes .

Dreams
Many depths of accustomed
Workings controlled when dreams single electric life do touch
Assessing expression , future affection , ways yesterday
O , to yesterday
The day , a way , flying through someone
Controlled my reigning
Accepting evenings knowledge , a shout
To a revelation laid endings , talks by a flower
No yesterdays , heart faster alternate
Mutant leaves creativity
Of clay , understand doors reigning silhouette our skylines
A stone
Expression - a children's - and being
Discoursing in lands , not put movement
Of hate - all expression creativity

Thousand answers sights done , understood , to mean changed

Memory come between all my antics
Did splendour I tell , a confusion endlessly ?
We quickly as turned understood
Seed on turned
Mountains flowering of my sunrise , forgotten valley

Oh , all hands when highest
Touching a future way there 's thunderous oppression
Straining and work , a spirit's

Will I be , I regaining , returning , to this woman ?
Outbound corner
Not I , apart yesterdays
You controlled my relayers , runner .

Liquid sweet girl disregard , conceived topographic endlessly
Strength mornings I consider the good ; highest

Watch one space season glider , I 'll awaken
Regaining together

A madrigal ; tell a marcher ,
Touch wonder 's hand , there 's running my eclipses
Somewhere accustomed

Six
Cadaeics
Conundrums , conundrums , conundrums ... nonsense !
I needed some outdoor atmosphere .
Taking Cambridge 's Literature , I opened a door , waved my hand , commenced a promenade .
" I'm a Cadaeic ! "
Huh ?
" I'm a Cadaeic !
I 'm a real Cadaeic ! " , shouted an old woman .
Astonished , I took a step back .
" A veritable Cadaeic , old woman ?
Really ? " Cadaeics ' myths were numerous .
A clique , a new mystic association , whose members had ... power .
An eerie power .
So , I was now most curious .
Still , staying calm , I placidly said , " Elucidate more , please . "
" Cadaeics have , " she murmured , " power .
Do you ?... "
" Yes , so I 've intimated .
Regardless , . . . Cadaeic ?
You apprehend this ? " I said .
" Yes , sir .
The true power lies greatly , heavily , within me . "
" What , " I softly inquired , " manner of power ?
A strength ?
telepathy ?
learning ? "
" The power " ( thusly continued that wizardly woman ) " makes change in paralleled , tunneling universes .
As I cultivate it , it is a powerful good , an element of great peace .
Deplorably , he - Surta - uses it quite evilly , altering original Cadaeic intent . "
" Changes ?
A Cadaeic scoundrel generating wild mutations ?
This , though intriguing , I can not quite see .
This humble spirit requires validation - your narrative produces numerous doubts ! "
" My apology , oh sir - I 'm utterly desperate .
A Cadaeic normally avoids ' incapables ' , enjoying other Cadaeic contacts only .
Can , stranger , you befriend me ?
Cadaeic existence - indeed , people 's existence - demands prompt action . "
Startled , I then asked , " What ?
A pedestrian incapable 's worthless skill ? "
" You , stranger , treasure the crucial analytic skills .
Our people undervalue numerical ideas , preferring arcane , mystical , Cadaeified philosophy .
Please help !
Oh my Surta !
O my Surta !
Oh , lamentable Surta ! O ! "
I replied , " Yes , outlander , I 'm available , amenable - also , somewhat numerical .
Please , completely disclose :
When I am expected ,
What assorted mathlike topics to review carefully ,
plus
Where Surta 's mysterious home is . "
" Come , I recommend , before seven on tomorrow night ( Michaelmas it is ) .
Of a mathematic nature , review mensuration , infinite series , and trisection .
Surta 's shadowy home ?
Meet me .
Cadaeic fortress awaits . "
As my rendezvous was concluded , I meandered back , returning home .
" Quite impossible , what ? " , thought I . " An old Cadaeic , a bad Cadaeic ... mythical powers subverted , indeed ! "
Regardless , curiosity still stayed .
The woman 's plea was serious , I concluded .
I desired an easement - perhaps more poetry .
Opening Oxford 's volume near " Poetry , Eliot " , stanzas quite strange yet notorious filled my eyes .
I saw Prufrock Lovesongs remarkably modified , thusly :
Seven
Prufrock
Let us depart then ,
While eventide 's withering skies threaten ,
Impersonating the sufferers etherising upon pallets ;
Together henceforth go , through these partially - unoccupied boulevards ,
Muttering arguments like shards
About furtive nights amid threadbare hostels ,
Discreet dialogues among oystershells ,
Street complexes like dreary argument .
Its insidious regiment
Now leads to heavy questions . . .
Never inquire distinctly , ' wherefore ? '
Directly go visit , herefore .
To an affair th' matriarchs sadly go
To talk touching MicAngelo .
Mist , cellophane breaths , rubbing on window latches ,
A creamlike mist , rubbing , muzzling on window lattices
Soon lingered on watery apartments a curt instant ,
Licked eventide 's perimeter , tonguelike
( Partially discolored by fallen soot ) ,
Vacillated a bit , making one extremely fast leap ,
And , deeming that March night too remarkably quiet ,
Stealthily curled womblike in quiescence , and fell perfectly asleep .
So , truly so , will exist a sundown
When amberlike fog permeates Cambridge Street
Above a door and a pane of doorglass ;
Peaceful nighttimes darkening a boulevard ,
Nighttimes whence faces verbalize to faces ;
Nighttimes expedient for murders , or to intercommunicate ;
Nighttime labors that create a query ,
A query exalted , henceforth summarily despised .
Times touching you , touching anybody whom I appreciate .
Times involving several thousand hiatuses ,
Forty illusions , forty revisions ,
Finally settled by elegantly sipping green teas .
Matriarch speakers persevere [ the discourses I forego ] ,
A - talking about old MicAngelo .
So , cursedly , will remain eternity .
I can meditate : ' To aspire ?
Evermore aspire ?'
Mornings for mounting stairs ,
Brushing uncovered spot in nervous , swarthy hair -
[ I think she 'll certainly recognize a thinness ! ]
Stiff shirt , adamantly in place on chin ,
Newly - purchased black tie , decorated using glamorous gold pin
[ I conjecture he 'll pronounce forthwith : ' Heavens !
So frail !
So thin ! ]
Should discreet adventures
Confound this earth ?
Certainly eternity remains
To preside and deride , then turn around , reversing prior opinions .
Life advances , barely known -
The mornings , the bright middays , the nights of it .
My career is marked , poignantly , utilizing teaspoons ;
I do know voices collapsing , sleepily collapsing , dying .
I do know the melodies emerging from the anterooms .
Henceforth , what ought I do ?
Full well I did notice those eyes , everyone 's glaring stares -
So glaring , implying formulated phrases .
Afterward [ quietly subdued ]
I , stick - pinned , embellish a wall ;
Sit stuck , wriggling , alongside baroque designs .
Altogether hopelessly extinguished , wherefore should I assume ?
Mournfully spitting lifetime 's butt - ends [ a dreary existence ] ,
What thoughts should thinkers think ?
Truly known : discreet arms , jewelled arms ,
Appendages slight and white and bare
[ By th' lamplights , covered up by an hairy gossamer ]
Is hyacinth what provokes memories ,
Causes such reveries ?
I loved graceful arms , lying across davenports or wrapping about nightgowns
Should , henceforth , I assume ?
Moreover , what to presume ?
. . . . .
The noiseless dusk falls on my narrow streets
When lonely fellows settle , smoking pipettes ,
Sacredly communing , shirt to shirt . . .
Oh , I can envision being as an empty claw
Scuttling violently about seas ' silent floors .
. . . . .
Thence unfolds an ominous property of the nighttime
Smoothed , having long hands ,
Asleep . . . tired . . . lingering ,
Easing comfortably beside you , while very serenely reposing beside me .
How , henceforth , after teapots , candies , ices ,
Might lonely man 's forgotten strength reenergize , and arise ?
Every afternoon I 've fasted and wept - cried , fasted .
Ofttimes I dreamed , then saw my head surrendered to Herod ;
I never approached prophet status , lamentably .
Though greatness came , quickly greatness went .
Often I recognized eternity 's hooded being , patiently biding , snickering .
Aftermath : fear perseveres .
So would it be valuable , valuable overall
Following saucers o' marmalades
Admixing porcelain and a talk among window shades ?
Therefore , I can wonder , valuable indeed ?
Alarmed by an evermore - present need
Pressing universes into mysterious balls
Slowly unraveling a disturbing , ultrameaningful difficulty .
I 'll say : ' Hallelujah !
Lazarus 's return !
I breathe , reanimate ,
To entirely answer mankind 's conundrums '
Afterward , if matriarchs , settling quietly upon pillows ,
Should derisively pronounce : ' I despise meanings
My soul renounces all meanings . '
Would anything transpire worthwhile , everything appraised ?
Might n't a time symbolize ' worthwhile ' ,
Following dreary sunsets , plain dooryards , shopping carts on street
O ' the novels , after - lunch teas , lingering dresses -
Evermore a measured existence ? -
It 's a so - difficult mission , enduring this struggle !
If a candle revealed my innermost yearnings
Exposing skeletons upon vertical screens
If an oldish woman , settling cushions ,
Discarding day 's tattered , light - colored shawl , should aver :
' Worthwhile ?
I know no moments worthwhile ,
Just shadowy , dreaded voids after while . '
. . . . .
I , too , am not William Shakspar 's Hamlet - this I know , above a doubt .
Am one related lord , posing on the side
For acting very small acts or starting small episodes ,
Most easy tool , Prince 's attentive slave ,
Am always ready , obedient , useful ,
Politic , cautious , of a meticulous frame ;
Extravagant also , a bit dense ;
Many moments I 've fitly enacted the classical Fools .
I 'm old . . . exceedingly old . . .
Soon my trouser I desire rolled .
A procession of contemplation - which marmalade flavor : raspberry ?
peach ?
I 'll arouse up , and I will walk on Dartmouth Beach
To hear mermaids sing sublimely , and beseech .
I continue ignored , sorrowfully uninspired .
I have spied mermaid scales going fast underneath the waves ,
Endlessly traversing an aquatic continent ;
Wandering the high seas , capricious and content .
Thus we deliberate , oceanbound ,
Looking for a harborside
Until mankind subsides .

The Readiness
Michaelmas .
Waking up , I carefully pondered the baffling dilemma .
" Fact : vast changes unsettle alphabetic writings .
Also , printed writings seem modified purposely ( though possibly it 's not so ) .
A fact : this woman ( Cadaeic ? )
I saw recently , before eventide , bravely spoke a fantastic tale .
She spoke concerning change also , and insinuated I 'm a relation amid these two ! "
I swallowed a breakfasty meal heartily , then gingerly I approached downstairs ' study for further linguistic review .
I read poetry , employed statistics , parsed phrases .
Near luncthime I modulated - as advised hitherto , I practiced mensuration , performed decimal expansion , and trisected triangles .
After my analytical labors , I read A Victorian Poetry Reader , The Book of Pastoral English Poets , Odes from Omar , Coleridge 's Heroic Poem , and Pindar 's Odes .
" Still , I am not winning " , I lamented .
I ruminated : " Is a chapter division 's numbering important ?
Ignoring all elsewhere , I considered antepenultimate divisions .
I succeeded there !
Eureka !
I codified a nice , simple formula which ( I said to myself ) " perfectly demonstrates the division 's pattern .
Some somewhat different rule appertains elsewhere , apparently . "
Quickly I wondered : " Always this functions thus ? "
To see , I inspected longer antepenultimate pieces .
Perfect agreement once again !
No antecedent chapters functioned similarly , sadly .
I read poetry again , while hearkening to my clock - it was , I marked , dinnertime .
Six literary booklets I collected ( and , conjointly , a coat ) .
On proceeding outwardly , the Cadaeic waited by a car .
" Quickly , neighbor , enter .
Surta conspires - great danger awaits , " she declared .
Instantly her vehicle ( holding unlikely mankind - protecting partners ! ) did accelerate and commenced travelling toward ... somewhere .
Driving purposely , my companion 's overall conduct was very somber .
" Serious , is it ? " I wondered .
To speak seemed an inapt stratagem , therefore nobody talked .
" I think " ( internally I said ) " of a poem 's subtleties I 'll reconsider . "
Thence appeared , transmuted , one quatrain that that eminent Persian - the tent - maker Omar - fashioned ( as translated by Edward FitzGerald ) , hence :
Nine
O Ruby Yachts
Poetic Muses alongside th' Bough
An oversupply o' Wine , possessed somehow
Thou with me treading Eden 's Wilderness
Through all it seems a Paradise enough !
[ Stanza twelve ;
Translator : FitzGerald , Ed A .
3rd ed. , 1872 ]

Clue
Completing poetical perusals , I restudied algorithms .
" Perhaps , " I speculated , " some counting scheme ? "
The car , I noticed , had just paused near downtown 's Market Court .
I then noted the miniature passageway which resided presently before us .
" Thence , neighbor , Surta awaits . "
A mysterious passageway stood there , entreating .
Entering , I discovered Surta 's friend there .
" Promptly , proceed .
Veritably , Surta 's inventing monstrous calamity . "
I walked the stone cobbles that covered the street and surveyed some ornamented doors .
My guide uttered a word ( magic ? ) .
Instantly I confronted an interior apartment - perhaps malevolent Surta 's room ?
I then discovered innumerable mystifying artifacts therein :
A " Mr. Sardonicus " poster ( Wm. Castler 's remarkable film )
Six heptagons containing six inscribed circles , drawn carefully below a weird finite - product formula
A large drawing showing horizontal striations with an underlined " sin ( x ¹² ) "
Several computer prints involving triangles and angles
Accurately - reproduced picture of the Woolsthorp Manor House ( Grantham , England )
Pieces for a strange " Snakes and Adder " children 's game .
So I observed hastily .
" Yes , I am close , " I said .
" Perhaps I am incredibly close now to resolving my dilemmas . "
I perceived a bookcase in shadow .
I repeated , " Surely , I am close ! " .
Infamous Surta 's shelves ( all in a grand display ) contained :
A Cambridge Treasury
Poe 's A Poem
Herbert 's Dune , Wyndham 's Triffids
Ad Infinitum & Beyond , Buzz Lite
Stories , Fitzgerald
Novels , Richardson
Aliceland , Lewis Carroll
Poems of England , Wordsworth
Oulipo Anthology , Perec
Several of my undeniable favorites I spotted among Surta 's shelves .
Undoubtedly worthy choices !
In my wandering I discovered Shakspar 's Comedies & Dramas .
" Hamletian inspection beckoneth ! " , I joked .
In restless expectancy , I located the final paragraphs .
Eleven
William Shakespeare 's tragedy King Claudius
[ Fifth ( terminal ) Act ]
. . . .
So it is - deceased tanners a-populate the earth in multitudes .
Wherefore ?
The skins are callously tanned !
Here 's , gravely , th' skull - O ! - of a celebrated confrere .
HAM .
Whose ?
Prithee , interpret .
A CLOWN .
A mad fellow , foolhardy whoreson .
Methinks he oftentimes frolicked i' your path .
HAML .
Ay , I frequently experience jovial company .
CLOWN .
A pestilence ' pon his head , stupid boaster !
Doubtlessly oftentimes did 'e brag : ' I am Yorick , emperor o' merrymakers !'
HAM .
Behold , [ Thrusting skullbone heavenward . ]
wretched Yorick !
Truly , Horaitio , truly I adored him - excellent banterer and a great wellspring o' happiness .
Thereon flourished a visage merry , a mouth pleasurably kissed , Horaitio .
Where , I beseech , O head , are Yorick 's verses , gibes , gambols ?
Sounds o' laughter tha' caus'd a table great gaiety ?
Quite chapfallen ?
Perceive , Horaitio , this deathmask expression : merriment , merriment , evermore merriment !
Horaitio , three troubling questions confound me .
HOR .
Disclose , prithee .
HAM .
Thus look 'd Cesar , as entombed ?
HOR .
Yes , I reckon .
HAM .
Would great Alexander 's remains offend this nostril similarly ?
O ! [ Releases skull . ]
HOR .
Quite severely , assuredly .
HAM .
So , is Caesar a dirtlike clump that remedies winecasks ' splits ?
HOR .
No , I say , no !
Blasphemy , sir !
HAM .
Understand , Horaitio - visualize mankind 's grave process .
Originally , Caesar dies .
In subsequent time , Caesar resides under th' earth .
Thereupon , celebrated Caesar 's decomposed .
Forthwith , 'e makes loam .
Consider - a loam , a plaste !
Might this overlord 's granules patch Horaitio's beer - barrel ?
A Caesar now becomes a sediment
Henceforth to toughen graveyard 's fundament ;
Although a sovereign overrules with ire ,
Henceforth , heartless , resembles th' ashy mire !

The Meeting
Carefully replacing Shakspar 's Dramas in its shelf , I immediately heard a distant tapping .
Anticipating Surta 's arrival , instead I saw my Cadaeic guide .
" Directly Surta will arrive , " she whispered .
" Already I have ascertained several things .
Every literary change that 's happened is , indeed , caused by Surta 's latest spell .
I ( actually , we , since I am quite unanalytical ) must determine what change he 's effected exactly , and what ( if anything ) will reverse it .
But silence ! - Surta arrives . "
Fleeing quickly , my guide disappeared within an adjacent chamber .
Evidently she maintained faith in my abilities - a faith that I did n't necessarily share .
Casting my gaze near Surta 's artifacts , I reassessed the clues present there .
Each literary piece that I had studied flashed in my mind .
Heuristic and mathematical schemes flickered in my brain .
I was interrupted by a stranger 's entrance .
" Greetings , stranger .
I knew that she was disreputable , but I never imagined she 'd enlist an incapable ... "
Clutching a paper sheaf , the middle - aged man snarled the final epithet .
Being sure he was Surta , I ( surprising myself ) gave a defiant reply .
" Capable , I 'd say , " I replied with sarcasm .
" Huge literary changes were the first clue that the universe was amiss .
Desecrated literature is n't a small matter - thus , I 'll rectify the injustice , " I declared .
" Fie ! " yelled Surta , suddenly .
" But a single flaw in my skills has permitted this discernment .
Fully the entire universe ( a single being excepted , apparently ) can't even perceive the literary changes . "
Determining that I was near the right track , I pressed ahead .
" Certainly , indeed , several rules determine each printed text 's structure .
Chapters besides the antepenultimate use a certain rule , and the antepenultimate uses a different rule . "
Haughtily I said this , as if sure , even as uncertainty nagged at my brain .
Clearly my statement had an effect , as Surta was visibly surprised .
" B'Gah 's skull ! " he hissed .
" Getting a bit near the truth there , but still ...
I can't be hindered by a mere lucky guesser .
Even with luck , my secret will remain hidden ! "
Jauntily , he remarked , " The literary effect can be reversed - in quite an elegant way , I must say - albeit certainly this will never happen .
But simply write a text using precisely the same rules as mine and all will be mended .
Hilarity ensues at the mere idea - what a time - waster !
Ha , ha , ha ! " , he cackled .
" Decidedly predictable , is n't he ? " , I said internally .
" A big speech just like the classic villain 's I 'm - invincible - thus - I - might - as - well - tell - the - secret spiel ! "
I had , it seemed , learned all I needed , except the exact rules determining a text 's structure .
Given that I had already divined the antepenultimate - chapter rule , I was certain that , given time , I 'd determine the remaining rules .
At that instant , my Cadaeic friend returned .
Flashing me a significant glance , she entered in earnest debate with Surta .
I sensed her cue and hurried exitward , stealthily grabbing the Shakspar 's Dramas as I left .
Cursedly , I remembered that we had entered rather magically .
I did n't have any idea where the exit was !
I thus walked the hallways until I saw an uninhabited chamber .
Camping there , I again began intense study , this time primarily in each text 's early chapters .
Giving A Midsummer Night 's Dream , the first play in the Shakspar reader , intense scrutiny , I suddenly saw it !
" Electrifying ! " , I exclaimed , as further study verified , at least tentatively , my belief .
A rumbling in the nearby wall suddenly caught my ear .
Jackhammers !
" Egress must be nearby , " I said quietly .
Hunting left and right at eye level I quickly spied a crack .
Behind it I saw the passageway we had walked a few minutes earlier .
Jumping back , I ran firmly at the wall .
Gingerly picking myself up after my inelegant exit , I hurried back in expectancy , desiring the mathematical treatises residing in my study .
During the next several days ( as Surta 's writing rules were quite difficult , the task advanced quite gradually ) I crafted a slim treatise - this very tale - that fulfilled the necessary requirements .
I finished it five days after Michaelmas at three A.M .
Descending my stairs , I apprehensively checked my Cambridge Treasury .
Despite my best attempts , mutated texts still met my eyes !
Evidently , I was still missing a key clue .
I was sure that my main rule ( describing all chapters but the antepenultimate ) was right - it was very bizarre , thus it must be right , I argued .
But a new idea appeared : as the antepenultimate rule I had crafted was relatively simple , perhaps there was an extra rule that applied as well ?
Carl Sandburg 's Grass inhabited the antepenultimate chapter in the Cambridge Treasury .
Just its few lines did I see , and study , thus :
Thirteen
Sandburg 's Grass
Caskets piled beneath Austerlitzes , Dresdens
As , silently uplifting , blanketing , grass
Disguises it all , it all .
And as fierce Gettysburg witnesses ,
Evident at Champagne , Falklands , Jutland ,
I am grassiness , settling ever thus .
But ten years passeth , and my guests plead :
Fury , military struggles , did mutilate us ?
Ere yesterday , hatefulness prevailed ?
Cut my grass .
Evergreen grasses mend .
Finale
The Victor
Though concise , the aforecited lines revealed new formal properties .
Thus I came to discover a new symbolic paradigm .
" It 's perfection now ! " , my conviction did maintain .
My book requested alteration - not , luckily , broad revision .
Following numerous fixes , my opus was perfect !
" Good show ! " I exulted cheerfully .
My intellect philosophized : " Is textual change fully mended ? " I examined Cambridge 's Anthology .
" Yes ! Reality returns ! "
. . . . .
Was this saga real ?
Apocryphal ?
Not believable ?
Perhaps .
Regardless , Cadaeic foes remain , perchance to reciprocate or obliterate .
I celebrate .
I end , whispering ad infinitums .
THE END
One of the most surprising , and gratifying , things that has happened since I started this site a year or so ago is the positive feedback I ’ve had for the anime reviews – especially from people I know are far from being massive fanboys like myself .
It ’s gratifying because its part of the reason I started writing them ; to try and introduce the medium to people who had never really indulged in it all , at least not past perhaps watching Spirited Away with their kids .
The problem is , once you ’ve had your first taste , where do you go next ?
Type ‘ anime ’ into Google and the results are bewildering , and without a little bit of guidance and a quality filter finding something to watch can be a daunting task .
There ’s a lot of shit out there , plus a lot of stuff that is n’t really meant for you …unless you ’re a ADHD stricken 12 year old emo - ninja - obsessed boy that refuses to eat anything except Pocky and instant Ramen .
So , as requested , I present my list of 10 ‘ mature ’ anime films you really should see .
They are in no particular order , the term ‘ mature ’ is kind of loose , seeing as at least two are really kids ’ films , and this is purely personal opinion .
If you disagree , see you in the comments section .
( After you ’ve read this , check out my list of ten anime series to see before you die . )
Akira ( 1988 )
For many of us in the west , this is the one that started it all .
Up until we first saw Katsuhiro Otomo‘s Akira , our only exposure to Japanese animation had been kiddies ’
Saturday morning shows like Speed Racer and Battle of the Planets , but I can still remember vividly sitting in a run-down arthouse cinema at the age of 17 with my jaw resting on the sticky floor as the opening scenes flashed in front of me .
Two hours later I was a complete convert .
Otomo heavily edited and re-wrote his own epic manga about rival motorbike gangs and genetically enhanced children to create this futuristic thriller , and it blew away critics and audiences in the west while breaking box office records back home in Japan .
It also opened the floodgates for anime into the US and Europe , but unfortunately with a lot of what was opportunistically exported ( distributors looking for visually similar / violent material instead of quality ) simply not being up to the same standard many potential new fans were turned off as quickly as they ’d been turned on .
Essential viewing .
Ghost in the Shell ( 1995 )
One of the most influential anime films of all time , Mamoru Oshii ’s Ghost in the Shell changed not only the look and feel of animated sci- fi but also had an impact on Hollywood ; most notably in the distinct visual style of the Matrix movies .
While some hardcore fans of Masamune Shirow ’s orginal action - packed and often light hearted manga still complain about the adaption ; Oshii ’s decision to turn it into a dark , brooding , beautifully paced drama ensured it ’s place as a science fiction classic .
It is without doubt the definitive visual depiction of the cyberpunk movement , and the closest there is to date of a filmic version of William Gibson ’s classic Sprawl Trilogy novels .
Not just a huge worldwide hit , it also spawned a huge franchise including a sequel , a planned Hollywood remake , two 26 part TV series , various novels , toys and video games , as well as the recent controversial Ghost in the Shell 2.0 special edition .
My Neighbour Totoro ( 1988 )
I ’ve talked at length elsewhere about how personally important My Neighbour Totoro is to me , so here I ’ll try not to gush too much .
There ’s so many reasons as to why Hayao Miyazaki ‘s masterpiece is such an enduring and perfect film ; the way he captures the energy and personalities of it ’s two child protagonists , and his never ending attention to detail combined with a beautifully simple score and Kazuo Oga ’s immaculate and breath - taking background paintings make it a joy to watch over and over again .
A fact I ’ve been re-assured of by friends with young children that insist on watching it on a near daily basis .
And that ’s probably Totoro ’s strongest point – the fact that it is family film that appeals to both children and adults alike without pandering to either with slapstick or ‘ knowing ’ humor .
If you have n’t seen it yet then you must – it is quite possibly the greatest animated film ever made .
Porco Rosso ( 1992 )
I ’ve already got one Miyazaki movie in this list , and it ’s hard to limit it to just two .
Picking a second one is even harder .
My opinion changes on a near daily basis , or depending on the last one I happened to watch .
But I ’ll always have a soft spot for Porco Rosso ; the tale of a WWI fighter ace turned bounty - hunter , cursed with the head of a pig and on the run for going AWOL from the Italian air force .
In many ways it must have been one of Miyazaki ’s most enjoyable projects to create , another fantastic family film that somehow manages to combine his obsession with aeronautic design and his personal politics .
The elaborate , lived in aircraft designs remain one of my favourite cinematic images of all time , while we learn that the reason Rosso is fleeing the Italian authorities is his disdain for the fascism that ’s steadily taking grip of Europe .
Oh , and he also manages to take a gentle swipe at US bravado along the way .
A perfect film .
Voices of a Distant Star ( 2002 )
Perhaps Voices of a Distant Star does n’t really belong here .
For a start its only 25 minutes long , and was first released on DVD , technically making it an OVA – which I said at the top of this post would n’t be included here .
Well , rules are made to be broken , plus it earns its place on this list for truly being a film you must see before you die .
Astonishing enough that it was single - handedly written , directed and animated by the now legendary Makoto Shinkai on his Mac at home , it is also one of the most touching , beautiful and exhilarating examples of animation produced in recent history .
The story of a long distant , text message relationship between a teenage mecha-pilot and her boyfriend back on earth , it combines gentle , slow - paced scenes with snatches of frantic sci-fi action , and has become the thematic and stylistic basis for Shinkai ’s subsequent large - budget productions .
It ’s probably available for stupidly cheap on DVD now , so you really have no excuse for not picking this mini-masterpiece up .
Royal Space Force : The Wings of Honneamise ( 1987 )
The feature film debut of the then still young – but now legendary – studio Gainax , Royal Space Force : The Wings of Honneamise is an unusual , compelling and skillfully crafted film .
Both a coming of age story and detailed analysis of the role of the space race in the Cold War , RSF tells the story of an alternate reality Earth , where two rival superpowers are locked in a constant propaganda and military stalemate , while a small team of underfunded scientists , engineers and pilots attempt to launch the first man into space .
While the film is beautifully animated with some fantastically detailed background art , it is also has substantial depth in terms of it ’s philosophical themes and characterisation .
As such it ’s not one for the whole family , but an unmissable and enthralling watch for anyone with an interest in what animation can truly achieve .
Patlabor : The Movie 2 ( 1993 )
The history of the Patlabor franchise is a long and complex one , but put simply under the guidance of Mamoru Oshii it developed ( in a way similar to how he remolded Ghost in The Shell ) from a light hearted but realistic police - mecha drama to a bleak , deeply political and philosophical thriller by the time he directed Patlabor : The Movie 2 .
While the first movie is just as enthralling , thoughtful and arguably more accessible , the sequel just steals the crown due to its uncompromising approach to its political themes and it ’s breathless , stark cinematic beauty .
It deals with Oshii ’s recurring theme of the hypocrisy of peace in the developed world , and in particular is a devastating attack on the foreign policy of a pacifist Japan that profits from the fates of distant waring nations .
Although over 15 years old now , it ’s portrayal of terrorism consists of some disturbingly prophetic imagery .
Possibly the closest anime has come to producing something to rival the large canvas , cinematic styles of the likes of Stanley Kubrick or Ridley Scott , it is an unmissable , if challenging , work .
Perfect Blue ( 1997 )
The directorial debut of anime auteur Satoshi Kon , Perfect Blue ’s story about a J - Pop idol turned actress being stalked by a obsessive fan was originally meant to be a live action drama , only scrapped due to the 1995 Kobe earthquake .
At first it ’s contemporary setting and often mundane situations are certainly reminiscent of a well - shot J - Horror movie , but in Kon ’s skilled hands the script slowly changes into something that could only be depicted by animation .
As a starting point for his re-occurring themes of disconnected realities and psychological fantasy it is subtler than his later works such as Paranoia Agent and Paprika , and as a result somehow creepier .
Certainly it ’s most famous scene – where we apparently see the central character being raped , only discovering she is just acting when the off camera director shouts ‘ cut ’ – is one thatpermanently sticks in the mind , as does the film ’s shocking , final revelation .
Memories ( 1995 )
Produced by Katsuhiro Otomo , and based on some of his short manga stories , Memories is a anthology of three films .
Although all science fiction they cover a wide range of styles , from the romantic , twisted reality of the Satoshi Kon scripted Magnetic Rose and the ludicrous bio - warfare black comedy Stink Bomb to the Orwellian , Brazil like dystopia of Cannon Fodder – the only one of the three directed by Otomo himself .
It is arguably the most compelling of the three , with it ’s Oshii - esque story of a war obsessed and controlled society and it ’s unique , steampunkesque visuals .
Despite the diverging themes and differing visual styles of the three chapters , there is an undeniably high standard of production throughout .
It ’s another film that can be easily and cheaply picked up on DVD at the moment , I ca n’t hesitate in recommending that you buy it on sight .
The Girl Who Leapt Through Time ( 2006 )
Loosely based on a popular Japanese novel , Mamoru Hosoda ’s The Girl Who Leapt Through Time tells the story of schoolgirl Makoto Konno , who discovers she has the ability to – literally – time leap ; that is to jump back in time to change situations and remake important decisions .
What starts as an enjoyable , funny and charming teenage drama slowly reveals itself to have a classic , well crafted science fiction story at it ’s heart , offering another , stylish but gentle , take on the conundrums and paradoxes thrown up by the idea of time - travel .
It ’s partly in this list to represent the talent of more recent directors and studios , but mainly because it ’s a warm , accessible , exciting and lovingly made film that will be held in high esteem for many , many years to come .
So what have I missed out ?
Where have i gone wrong ?
Well for a start I notice straight away that although there ’s two Studio Ghibli films , there ’s nothing by Isao Takahata – No Grave of the Fireflies or Only Yesterday – which ca n’t be right , surely ?
I guess it ’s a good sign for anime ’s heritage that compiling such a list and limiting it to just ten means so many great works are missing , but I ’m sure some of you will be upset that I ’ve left out your favourite personal masterpiece .
If so , hit the comments below and let it all out .
" It is likely that thousands of children or young people across Ireland were abused by priests in the period under investigation and the horror of that abuse was not recognised for what it is , " he said during his Holy Thursday homily .
Japanese fashion usually brings to mind kimono , yukata , or the sailor school uniforms .
And for many people around the world who are interested in fashion , the lesser known styles and subcultures of Japan are becoming more widely recognized .
The fashions on this list were worn at different times in Japan during the twentieth century and today .
With some groups of Japanese teenagers these styles were extremely popular .
They were viewed as creative and influential to fashion by some , and looked on with confusion and amusement by others .
1 Sukeban
Suke means female , and Ban means boss .
Sukeban were known for forming all girl gangs , and then committing acts of violence and shoplifting .
Sukeban gangs first began to appear in the 60s .
They were inspired by the gangs of boys known as Bancho , who hoped to one day join the yakuza .
There was quite a range in size for the Sukeban groups , but the largest was known as the Kanto Women Delinquent Alliance , which included 20,000 girls .
Rival groups would often get into fights .
The Sukeban girls followed strict rules within their own groups , and breaking them would result in lynching .
Getting burned with a cigarette was considered only a mild punishment .
Sukeban were always seen in their sailor uniforms .
They would wear pleated skirts that went down to their feet , and would custom embroider their uniforms .
2 Takenokozoku
The Takenokozoku were some of the first to form Harajuku into one of the best known places to view Japanese street fashion .
The style was popular in the late 70’s and early 80s , and consisted of neon colored accessories such as beads , whistles , bows , and nametags .
A store called Takenoko inspired the clothes worn by the Takenokozoku , which were influence by traditional Japanese fashion .
Their outfits were loose and baggy , and usually hot pink or bright blue or purple .
They wore robes with kanji characters , and slippers that were comfortable for dancing .
Large groups of Takenokozoku would choreograph dances in the streets of Harajuku , playing the current popular music on their boom boxes .
3 Yanki and Bosozoku
Motorcycle gangs became popular in Japan in the early 60s , and became known as Speed Tribes ( Bosozoku ) .
In the 70s , girl motorcycle gangs began to appear .
At the time , it was estimated by police that at least 26,000 Japanese citizens were involved in a biker gang .
By the 80s , the number of male biker groups began to decrease .
However , more and more girl biker groups began to pop up .
Yanki , heavily influenced by both the Bosozoku and the Sukeban , often wore sarashi ( white cloth wrapped around the chest ) , an embroidered tokko fukku robe , and a gauze mask .
The Bosozoku also owned customized scooters .
4 Ko Gal
The word Gal has been used since the 80s in Japan to describe a girl who likes trendy clothing .
Ko Gal was first used in the 90s by the media to describe an eighth grader who made $ 4000 a month for paid dating with middle aged men .
Ko comes from the Japanese word for child , kodomo .
Ko Gals tried to look as young as possible , by wearing the cutest accessories they could find .
They wore their school uniforms with the skirts shortened , tanned their skin , and bleached their hair .
And of course , the famous loose socks .
Some girls would use sock glue to keep their loose socks from slipping .
Although some Ko Gals of Shibuya did take part in enjo kosai ( paid dating ) , it was not quite as popular as the media made it out to be .
As the style spread from Tokyo to around Japan , Kogal movies , magazines , and TV programs became popular .
Kogals were never seen without their phones , and they were some of the first avid young technology users in Japan .
Ko Gal fashions has evolved into some of Japan ’s present styles , such as Hime ( princess ) Gal .
Hime Gal involves wearing expensive brand name clothing , usually of the pink and frilly variety .
5 Ganguro
Although Ko Gals had tan skin , Ganguro girls took tanning to a new extreme .
They would tan their skin every week , and then apply foundation meant for black women .
Ganguro literally means “ Black Face . ”
Besides tanned skin , the Ganguro look included platforms shoes , mini dresses , bleached hair , black ink used for eyeliner , blue contacts , and white concealer used for lipstick .
A Gal magazine called Egg featured Buriteri , one of the most well known Ganguro , on its cover .
The look was popular with groups of teenagers in Shibuya , however , they were often harassed , or viewed by the general public with disgust .
By the end of 2001 , the trend had died down and tanning salons began to close .
6 Manba
The Manba style , which is still seen today , shares many similarities with Gonguro .
The name comes from the word Yamanba , the name of an ugly witch in a Japanese folktale ( Yamanba was a term the media used for the Gonguro ) .
Because of the dangers of tanning , they often use dark skin foundation instead .
Groups of Manba participate in Para Para dancing , or quick synchronized movements to techno music .
Groups of Manba form Gal circles , the most popular one being Angeleek .
Boys who spent their time in the same clubs as Manba adopted their own similar style .
They became known as Center Guys ( after Shibuya ’s Center Street ) .
Manba clothes and accessories vary , but are always trendy and garishly bright .
Manba makeup consists of white lips and large white circle around the eyes .
Colorful decals are placed around the face , and rainbow hair extensions are also popular .
7 Kigurumin
Kigurumin was a short lived ( 2003 to 2004 ) and strange fashion phenomenon .
Girls who spent their time hanging out in Shibuya and wanted something comfortable to wear began sporting cheap animal costumes bought in party sections of stores .
Along with a Pikachu , Hamtaro , or Winnie the Pooh costume , Kigurumin would carry animal purses , cute accessories , and wear manba makeup .
8 Nagomu Gal
Nagomu was an indie record label created in 1983 .
The label gained a large fan base .
The name for fans , Nagomu Gals , first appeared in the magazine Takarajima .
Nagomu Gals favored vintage clothing .
They often wore long sleeved t- shirts , thick soled rubber shoes , and knee socks .
The term Nagomu Gal was not exactly positive , as they were sometimes viewed as annoying fan girls .
In 1989 the Nagomu label was shut down .
9 Lolita
Lolita is one of the most popular new Japanese subcultures , and has begun to appear in countries across the world .
There are numerous Lolita brands , such as Baby the Stars Shine Bright , Metamorphose , and Angelic Pretty .
Lolita fashion began becoming popular in the late 90s , and like the Nagomu style , it has been influenced by music .
Gothic record labels in Japan lead to visual kei music , which helped inspire Gothic Lolita clothing .
Visual kei refers to bands which wear extremely elaborate makeup and costumes .
Lolita is also inspired by the clothing of the Rococo period .
The name came from Mana ( from the visual kei band Malice Mizer ) who called the theme of his clothing line Elegant Gothic Lolita .
The popular magazine Gothic and Lolita Bible came out in 2001 .
There are several different types of Lolita .
Gothic Lolita involves primarily black frilled clothing .
Sweet Lolita uses pastels , and lots of lace and bows .
For punk Lolita , plaids and chains are combined with the frills .
Wa Lolita incorporates traditional Japanese clothing , such as kimono , into the look .
Accessories that are popular for Lolita include bonnets and headdresses , rocking horse shoes , parasols , petticoats , and frilled knee socks .
10 Decora
Decora is a Japanese street style popular today .
In 1997 , the magazine FRUiTS was created to display photographs of Japanese street fashion .
Aki Kobayashi , the cover model of the first issue , wrote columns for FRUiTS about her style and how she created her own accessories .
Soon , girls began making their own eccentric accessories .
The style became known as Decora , and its followers traded and sold their accessories in Harajuku .
Although each Decora outfit is unique , they all have the similarities of being extremely bright , decorative ( hence the name ) , and cute .
Decora girls wear an insane amount of plastic accessories and barrettes , neon skirts , colorful socks , and cute character products .
DAKAR
Health workers in Nigeria , considered the epicentre of the current wave of polio outbreaks in West Africa , and in neighbouring countries are racing to stop the spread of polio infections .
Incurable , the highly infectious virus causing polio leads to irreversible paralysis in one out of every 200 cases – and up to 10 percent of these persons die when their breathing muscles are frozen – according to World Health Organization ( WHO ) , which considers one case an epidemic .
“ We are making progress [ vaccinating ] , notably in [ northern Nigeria 's ]
Kano state , but other areas are still patchy , ” said Oliver Rosenbauer with WHO ’s Polio Eradication Group .
“ We are improving [ the rate of children immunised ] , but we are not quite there yet . ”
Of Nigeria ’s 801 reported cases in 2008 , more than one - fourth came from Kano state .
Nigeria is one of four endemic countries worldwide where polio infections originate before they are transferred “ silently and stealthily across borders , ” said Rosenbauer .
He said a case diagnosed recently in Indonesia came from Nigeria .
“ It is not just neighbouring countries that are at risk .
This virus travels . ”
Spread
As of 7 April , 232 cases have been reported in 2009 worldwide according to WHO .
Nigeria 's northern region has reported 123 infections .
More than 30 cases have been reported in seven neighbouring countries this year -- Benin , Burkina Faso , Côte d’Ivoire , Ghana , Mali , Niger and Togo , which had been largely polio - free since 2004 , with only Niger reporting annual outbreaks before 2008 .
But even more African countries are at risk , according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies ( IFRC ) , which recently launched a US $ 2.1 - million appeal to vaccinate in Angola , Central African Republic , Democratic Republic of Congo , Ethiopia , Ghana , Kenya , Sudan and Uganda , in addition to the above countries .
Resistance
Four years after Muslim clerics in northern Nigeria issued warnings based on fears that hormones in the vaccine could cause sterility and HIV infection , resistance is no longer the primary reason children miss vaccinations , WHO ’s Rosenbauer said .
“ Only about 10 percent of missed cases are because of resistance . "
Rosenbauer told IRIN vaccinators may have poor neighbourhood maps and are unable to locate children , do not find them at home or do not have enough vaccines and ice to keep the doses cool .
I 'm not convinced of its safety despite all the noise that it is safe for children
But a 46 - year - old father of seven in Kano state , Haruna Maikudi , said he is still not convinced the vaccine is safe .
“ I still do n't allow my children to receive [ the ] polio vaccine because I 'm not convinced of its safety despite all the noise that it is safe for children . ”
He added that many believe the Kano state government “ was arm - twisted into resuming the polio immunisation after it stopped the campaign in 2003 . ”
Maikudi told IRIN that he and other parents continue to refuse calls to vaccinate .
" We are yet to be told what those sex hormones are doing in the [ polio ] vaccine in the first place .
This is why I and many others do n't give the vaccine to their children . "
The national government declared the vaccine safe in 2004 after independent tests in three countries confirmed its safety , and some northern clerics lifted their opposition .
Umar Bello , a 31 - year - old father of three , told IRIN polio is not a priority for him .
" Health workers chase us to our homes offering [ the ] polio vaccine to our children while we are left without inoculation and drugs for more serious and fatal diseases like malaria , measles and meningitis , which we battle with everyday . ”
Health
workers chase us to our homes offering [ the ] polio vaccine to our
children while we are left without inoculation and drugs for more
serious and fatal diseases
He said he recently had difficulty finding anti-malaria medication for his child .
But WHO ’s Rosenbauer said radio jingles , posters , door - to - door campaigns and a government commitment to polio vaccinations have helped spread the message about preventing polio .
Twenty percent of the families surveyed in Kano state this time last year reported that their children had been vaccinated against polio , versus 40 percent this year , said Rosenbauer .
“ But there is still a ways to go , " he added .
Health workers ’ goal is to vaccinate 90 percent of all children under five to build up “ herd immunity , ” or a group ’s ability to withstand an epidemic .
As long as one child is infected all children are at risk , according to WHO .

The UN's World Health Organization has raised the alert over swine flu to level five - indicating human - to - human transmission in at least two countries .
It is a " strong signal that a pandemic is imminent " , the WHO says .
In Mexico , at the epicentre of the outbreak , people have been urged to stay at home over the next five days .
There are numerous cases elsewhere - the highest number outside Mexico is the US - and Europeans have been told it is certain there will be deaths .
WHO PANDEMIC ALERT PHASES Phase 1 : No infections in humans are being caused by viruses circulating in animals .
Phase 2 : Animal flu virus causes infection in humans , and is a potential pandemic threat .
Phase 3 : Flu causes sporadic cases in people , but no significant human - to - human transmission .
Phase 4 : Human - to - human transmission and community - level outbreaks .
Phase 5 : Human - to - human transmission in at least two countries .
Strong signal pandemic imminent .
Phase 6 : Virus spreads to another country in a different region .
Global pandemic under way .
Post - peak : Pandemic activity appears to be decreasing though second wave possible .
Post - pandemic : activity returns to normal , seasonal flu levels .
BACK {current} of {total} NEXT Several countries have restricted travel to Mexico and many tour operators have cancelled holidays .
Other countries are resisting calls to implement travel bans or close borders , on the grounds - backed by the WHO - that there is little evidence of their efficacy .
In the latest developments : The Netherlands confirms its first case of swine flu , in a three - year - old boy recently returned from Mexico .
Cases have also been confirmed in Switzerland , Costa Rica and Peru
European health ministers were set to meet for emergency talks to co-ordinate national efforts to contain the spread of the virus
Ghana has become the latest country to ban pork imports as a precaution against swine flu , though no cases have been found in the West African country
China 's health minister says that the country 's scientists have developed a " sensitive and fast " test for spotting swine flu in conjunction with US scientists and the WHO .
The country has recorded no incidence of the flu yet .
' Urgent action '
Announcing the latest alert level after an emergency WHO meeting in Geneva , Director General Margaret Chan urged all countries to activate their pandemic plans , including heightened surveillance and infection - control measures .
CONFIRMED CASES
Mexico : 168 suspected deaths - eight confirmed US : one death , at least 91 confirmed cases New Zealand : 3 confirmed cases Canada : 19 confirmed cases UK : 6 confirmed cases Spain : 10 confirmed cases Germany : 3 confirmed cases Israel , Costa Rica : 2 confirmed cases each The Netherland , Switzerland , Austria , Peru : 1 confirmed case each

She said action should be undertaken with " increased urgency " .
She added : " It really is the whole of humanity that is under threat in a pandemic . "
But she also said the world was " better prepared for an influenza pandemic than at any time in history " .
Ms Chan stressed on Wednesday that there was no danger from eating properly cooked pork .
She advised hygiene measures such as hand - washing to prevent infection and said it was important " to maintain a level of calm " .
Meanwhile in Mexico , President Felipe Calderon has announced the partial suspension of non-essential work and services from 1 to 5 May - a holiday period there .
In a TV address , he urged people to stay in with their families - saying there was " no place as safe as your own home " .
He said he was " proud " of the response of Mexicans to the crisis , and assured people Mexico was well - stocked with anti-viral medicines .
Already , schools across Mexico have closed , public gatherings are restricted and archaeological sites have been placed off - limits .
From Stephen Gibbs in Mexico City , Mexico
Since the swine flu outbreak began here , the government has faced the dilemma of wanting to prevent people spreading the disease - without paralysing the economy .
With this latest directive it appears to have struck a compromise .
All " non-essential " areas of the economy are to be shut down , for five days from 1 to 5 May .
The government has not been specific about what it means by non essential - but it does say medical , food , transportation and financial sectors will function as normal .
Mexican economy squeezed Mexico is already being hit hard by the global economic slowdown , and the country 's finance minister says swine flu could cut a further half - percent of GDP .
The search for the source of the outbreak continues , with the focus on the vicinity of a pig farm in the eastern part of the country .
The Mexican government is urging against jumping to conclusions and is suggesting the possibility remains that the virus originated outside the country .
Officials have put the number of suspected deaths from swine flu in Mexico at 168 , although just eight deaths have been confirmed , with 26 infections positively tested .
In Europe , the director - general of health and consumer protection , Robert Madelin , said the continent was well prepared but nonetheless deaths from the disease were expected .
" It is not a question of whether people will die , but more a question of how many .
Will it be hundreds , thousands or tens of thousands ? " , he said , speaking to Reuters news agency .
Movement bans ?
At the meeting of health ministers on Thursday , a French proposal of issuing a continent - wide travel advisory for Mexico will be discussed - though it is unclear whether it is in the power of the EU executive to impose such a ban .
SYMPTOMS - WHAT TO DO
Swine flu symptoms are similar to those produced by ordinary seasonal flu - fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , chills and fatigue
If you have flu symptoms and recently visited affected areas of Mexico , you should seek medical advice
If you suspect you are infected , you should stay at home and take advice by telephone initially , in order to minimise the risk of infection
Q&A : What is swine flu ?
Swine flu :
How serious a threat ?
Can masks help stop spread ?
The quest for a swine flu vaccine Spain has seen the first case of a person contracting swine flu without having travelled there .
After Mexico , the US has recorded the next highest number of confirmed cases , with 91 - and the first death of swine flu outside Mexico , after a visiting Mexican child died in Texas .
President Barack Obama has urged local public - health bodies to be vigilant and said schools with confirmed cases " should consider closing " .
About 100 have so far done so .
There are no current plans to close the border with Mexico , Mr Obama said on Wednesday evening .

When Michelle Obama helped break ground on the White House organic garden , I ’m sure she understood that the benefits went far beyond the borders of the veggie patch .
It may help create green collar , shovel - ready jobs .
Low - income kids from local schools get an incredible opportunity they will never forget : playing in a vegetable garden and learning where our food comes from , at the White House , while they grow food that may well be eaten by our President or the President of Costa Rica or South Africa .
The garden also provided other intangibles that America needs right now : hope , independence , and a can - do attitude .
Michelle ’s approval rating stands at 84 % , and most articles talking about why she ’s so popular will mention the garden .
But I have to wonder … did she guess that she ’d be saving the taxpayers money by reducing the grocery bills at the White House ?
A recent Wall Street Journal article touted the savings in backyard gardens : investments as small as a dollar can produce $ 75 worth of veggies , and the average family with a garden saves about $ 530 per year on groceries .
Intrigued , I decided to investigate my own cost / benefit analysis in my small organic garden in San Francisco .
I ’m lucky to have garden space .
Many in San Francisco do n’t , and must rely on community gardens if they want to grow things .
But as outdoor space in the city goes , my garden is fairly typical : small and shared with several neighbors .
The garden itself is about 150 square feet all told .
I have to pass everything by my neighbors who co-own the backyard with me .
That said , it still works , as there are many benefits to a garden like mine .
California in general and San Francisco in particular have spectacular weather for growing things , and the soil is quite fertile .
As an added bonus , I live on the sunny side of the city , in the beautiful Mission district .
The number of organic gardening resources here , such as garden stores specializing in organics , as well as neighbors who have been gardening without chemicals for 30 years , as you might expect for the greenest city in America , is quite high .
And thankfully , my neighbors love organic produce , and have entrusted me to produce a bunch of it .
We split costs , and we split the produce , while I do the work .
To begin , I needed some compost , a shovel and some plants and seeds .
I started modestly , with a couple of plants , an inexpensive drip irrigation system , and some soil amendments .
I had a little experience , but mainly just asked the gardeners at the local garden store for their advice , which proved quite prophetic .
The kiwi vines ( male and female ) immediately took off , as did the Russian Kale , spinach , two types of lettuce , kumquat , rosemary and chocolate mint .
The peas died because I put them in a place that did n’t get enough sun .
The cabbage was chomped by dreaded garden snails .
The cilantro died a mysterious death and was unrecoverable .
But , there was enough success for me to be encouraged , and my neighbors were happy enough that they committed more funds to the cause .
So , I bought a couple of fruit trees , more compost , and a few more seeds and plants .
Now , tomatoes are thriving , strawberries are spreading out , squash is taking over ( as it does ) , and the spinach has become a bush the size of Stephen Colbert ’s fake ego .
All told , I probably spent $ 300 ( split 3 ways , so I personally only spent about $ 100 ) , and a couple of Saturdays plus an hour here and there for weeding and other maintenance , and now my garden is thriving and abundant with food .
Just this morning , I made a spinach and Russian Kale omelette .
Last night , I had kumquats in my adult beverage , and complemented my potato burrito with fresh rosemary and a salad consisting of about half garden and half non-garden ingredients .
I eat a lot of salads .
We all do , and the spinach , kale , and lettuce still continues to out - produce our needs .
I frequently bring produce to my friends whenever I go visit .
In two years , my garden should be producing a bounty of low - maintenance fruit .
I planted fuji apples , Santa Rosa plums , meyer lemons , kiwi , apricots , pears , and peaches .
These were all ultra - dwarf varietals ( except for the kiwi , which are vines ) , meaning that none of the trees will exceed 8 feet in height … good for keeping neighbors happy in tight quarters like ours .
And none of them did I have any particular knowledge of before going down to my local garden center .
I simply asked what fruit would thrive in my neighborhood , and heeded the advice of the salespeople .
I fully expect a Return on Investment for my organic garden in the thousands of percent range , year after year , for many years to come .
My Return on Happiness has already exceeded my wildest expectations , and I have numerous friends who are following my lead with container gardens , window boxes , or small plots of their own .
Perhaps my favorite outcome so far is that my neighbor ’s 4 - year - old son loudly exclaims how much he loves peaches every time I see him .
He ’s shown a natural curiousity about the things growing in our garden that gives me tremendous hope for our future .
Or perhaps the best outcome is that my diet has gotten more varied and substantially weirder .
While Russian Kale frequently makes its way into my breakfast , I also found myself weeding my garden with one hand and grazing on spinach leaves with the other .
I would estimate that 5 - 10 % of what I eat comes from my garden now .
I expect that number to grow , but at the very least , I can say confidently that I ’ve saved more than the hundred dollars I put into the place , just from salad greens alone .
Scott Cooney is the author of Build a Green Small Business : Profitable Ways to Become an Ecopreneur ( McGraw - Hill ) , and does n’t think having Russian Kale for breakfast is weird at all .

En el negocio de las drogas en M�xico participan directamente unas 150 mil personas que mueven capitales hasta por 25 mil millones de d�lares , dijo el martes el director de la oficina de narcotr�fico internacional del Departamento de Estado .
Adicionalmente , unas 300 mil personas participan en el cultivo de mariguana y opio , declar � David T. Johnson en una audiencia ante el subcomit� de operaciones extranjeras de la C�mara de Representantes .
Esa cantidad de protagonistas produjo unas 18 toneladas de hero�na en 2008 y casi 16 mil toneladas de mariguana , orientados directamente al mercado estadounidense .
Un 90 % de la coca�na que llega a Estados Unidos pasa por M�xico procedente de Sudam�rica , afirm � Johnson en la vista convocada para renovar el financiamiento de la Iniciativa M�rida , propuesta hace dos a�os por el entonces presidente George W. Bush y su colega mexicano Felipe Calder�n .
No indic� el volumen de coca�na que se consume en Estados Unidos , pero el Pent�gono ha calculado anteriormente el consumo mundial en 600 toneladas , de las cuales la mitad o unas 300 toneladas llegan al mercado estadounidense , de las cuales 270 toneladas pasar�an por territorio mexicano .
Johnson dijo que el fen�meno de la droga en M�xico ha generado problemas de corrupci�n , lavado de dinero , hacinamiento en las prisiones , problemas en la frontera , incremento de la demanda y m�s recientemente una oleada de violencia .
Indic� que el consumo de drogas en M�xico se ha duplicado desde 2002 a 500 mil adictos y que posiblemente unos 3.5 millones de personas consume drogas ilegales en el pa�s .
El Congreso est� en proceso de aprobar los primeros 465 millones de d�lares de la Iniciativa M�rida .
De ese total , 400 millones corresponden a M�xico .

Bay Area Reconstructive and Plastic Surgeon , Dr. Robert Aycock has been practicing cosmetic surgery since 1988 .
Dr. Aycock is a Board - Certified Plastic Surgeon with offices in the San Francisco Bay Area in Walnut Creek and Greenbrae , California .
He is the Founder and Medical Director of Greenbrae Surgery Center and Bon Air Surgery Center .
After completing his medical training in Michigan , Dr. Aycock trained in the General Surgery Department at Providence Hospital in Southfield , Michigan .
He was then selected to be a resident in the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Providence Hospital , and the world - renowned Craniofacial Institute , where children worldwide are referred for reconstruction of many congenital deformities .
During his time at Providence Hospital , Dr. Aycock was privileged to receive extensive training from the renowned staff of plastic surgeons .
This training was in all aspects of trauma care as well as in his specialty of cosmetic surgery .
Dr. Aycock received further training in plastic surgery and craniofacial surgery at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota , as well as burn reconstruction training for the Brooke Army Burn Unit in San Antonio , Texas .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- A bankruptcy filing by General Motors Corp. GM , +2.12 % would prompt the publisher of the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , +1.66 % to remove the car maker 's stock from the blue - chip average and could cause a revamp of other components , said Sybille Reitz , a spokeswoman for Dow Jones Indexes , Friday .
" If a company files for bankruptcy we would typically remove it from the index , " she said .
" Then we review the whole index , and if we feel that there are additional changes needed , then we would react , " she said .
Wall Street Journal managing editor Robert Thomson , working with other WSJ editors , decides which companies should be included in the 30 - member index .
Launched on May 26 , 1896 , the Dow average typically includes U.S. companies that are industry leaders and that " have a long - standing history , " Reitz said .
The European Parliament has cast its final vote in favor of an amendment that will prevent member states from implementing three - strikes laws .
Disconnecting alleged file - sharers based on evidence from anti-piracy lobby groups restricts the rights and freedoms of Internet users , according to the amendment .
For the fifth time in a year the European Parliament has spoken out against tougher anti-piracy legislation that would allow alleged file - sharers to be disconnected from the Internet , based on evidence provided by anti-piracy lobby groups .
Instead , they chose to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of Internet users .
In a vote earlier today , 407 Members of Parliament voted in favor of the amendment ( 138/46 ) while only 57 were opposed .
After a bureaucratic pinball game with several votes on the same text , the amendment of the Telecoms package is now likely to be signed into law .
This is a strong message from Europe in favor of the individual rights of Internet users and against the widely opposed HADOPI law that French President Nicolas Sarkozy hopes to pass in the near future .
In April it was mistakenly voted out by the French Parliament , but this is not likely to happen twice .
The entertainment industry , including Sarkozy ’s wife , has has been lobbying for tougher anti-piracy legislation for years and despite the recently adopted amendment , France can not be forced to throw their “ three - strikes ” law overboard .
Sarkozy himself put a lot of effort into ditching the amendment , as head of the European Council he already went against the democratic vote by rejecting it .
Nevertheless , the amendment was not adopted after a few months of delay .
This is a step in the right direction , and it clearly goes against Sweden ’s IPRED and France ’s HADOPI laws .
Let ’s hope this will at least prevent other member states of the EU following the lead of these two countries .
Thorsten F. staunte nicht schlecht , als ihm sein Hoster am Dienstag vergangener Woche aus heiterem Himmel die Domain kündigte .
" Ich war erst mal sprachlos " , sagt der 38 - Jährige .
Ohne Angaben von Gründen hatte die Domainfactory GmbH , bei deren Tochtermarke DomainGo der Selbständige seine Domain pifo.biz registriert hatte , den Stecker gezogen und den Vertrag gekündigt .
Erst auf hartnäckiges Nachfragen teilt der Hoster mit , dass die Domain auf Betreiben des Bundesinnenministeriums ( BMI ) deaktiviert worden sei .
Der Stein des Anstoßes ist die " die unzulässige Verwendung von Bundesabzeichen "
Stein des Anstoßes war eine auf der Subdomain bmi.pifo.biz gehostete Website , die dem alten Internetauftritt des BMI nachempfunden war .
Während die Website in Teilen offenbar eine genaue Kopie der offiziellen Schäuble - Homepage war , setzten sich andere Teile in deutlich satirischer Absicht mit Themen wie Internetsperren oder Überwachung auseinander .
Nachdem Thorsten F. gegenüber Domainfactory schriftlich versichert hatte , die von offizieller Seite angemahnte Website nicht weiter zu veröffentlichen , nahm der Hoster die Kündigung zurück .
Doch dauert es einige Zeit , bis Thorsten F. erfährt , was genau er sich eigentlich hat zu Schulden kommen lassen .
Das BMI , bei dem er nachgefragt hat , weiß nichts von einer Beschwerde , sagt er. Auf Nachfrage beim Hoster wird klar : Beschwert hatte sich das Bundesverwaltungsamt ( BVA ) , das unter anderem über die Verwendung hoheitlicher Kennzeichen wacht .
" Unter der o.g .
Domain [...] wird der Internetauftritt des Bundesministeriums des Innern nachgeahmt " , steht in dem Fax des Bundesverwaltungsamtes .
" Wir bitten Sie als Provider , die genannte Domain umgehend zu sperren . "
Für den Hoster ist die unzulässige Verwendung von Bundesabzeichen eine " schwere Vertragsverletzung " und rechtfertigt eine fristlose Kündigung des Vertrags .
Bei der Entscheidung habe die Gestaltung der Website ein Rolle gespielt , erläutert der Rechtsanwalt von Domainfactory gegenüber heise online .
So hätten einige Links weiterhin auf die echten Seiten des BMI verwiesen , was die Gefahr einer Verwechslung erhöht habe .
Wenn die Rechtsabteilung einen " klaren Rechtsverstoß " sieht , habe er keine Wahl , als sofort zu sperren , sagt Oliver Marburg von Domainfactory .
" Wir haben dann umgehend Kontakt zum Kunden aufgenommen " .
In einer ausführlichen öffentlichen Stellungnahme erklärt Domainfactory , was auch der Anwalt des Unternehmens im Gespräch mit heise online nachdrücklich betont : Leicht habe man sich die Entscheidung nicht gemacht .
Der Sperranspruch des Regierungsorgans sei gegen die Rechtsgüter Meinungs - und Kunstfreiheit abgewogen worden .
Als Provider sei das Unternehmen " keinesfalls daran interessiert , eine leichtfertige Unterbindung der Verbreitung von ' unbequemen ' Informationen zu unterstützen . "
Domainfactory weist darauf hin , im Falle des Falles für Kunden auch durch die Instanzen zu gehen – auf eigenes Risiko .
Das Bundesverwaltungsamt ist nicht von sich aus tätig geworden .
Die Initiative ging vom BMI aus , erklärt das BVA .
Das
Amt verwaltet die Domains des Bundes und ist für die Verfolgung der unbefugten Benutzung von Hoheitszeichen zuständig .
Auf der fraglichen Domain seien " unzulässigerweise der Name , das Logo , der Bundesadler , Fotos und das Design des Bundesministeriums des Innern verwendet " worden , erläutert ein Sprecher der Bonner Behörde auf Anfrage von heise online .
Das BVA beruft sich auf den Namensschutz nach § 12 BGB , der auch öffentlich - rechtlichen Körperschaften zustehe .
Darüber sei " die unbefugte Nutzung des Bundesadlers " eine Ordnungwidrigkeit .
Dabei räumt das BVA ein , dass es sich um Satire handelt .
Eine Abwägung , ob die Seite deshalb etwa von Kunst - oder Meinungsfreiheit gedeckt sei , habe stattgefunden .
" Auch wenn die maßgeblichen Inhalte auf ' bmi.pifo.biz ' als Satire zu bewerten sind " , heißt es in der Stellungnahme der Behörde , " führt es im konkreten Fall zu keiner anderen rechtlichen Bewertung . "
Warum beim Provider sofort eine Sperrung veranlasst und nicht zuerst der Betroffene direkt kontaktiert wurde ?
Auch der Provider habe ein " besonderes Interesse " daran , die Inhalte möglichst schnell vom Netz zu nehmen , meint das BVA .
Thorsten F. hat den Disput mit dem Hoster beigelegt und seine Domain inzwischen zurück .
Die gesperrte Seite ist verändert wieder online .
Er hätte diese Änderungen auch sofort vorgenommen , wenn ihn jemand auf die rechtlichen Probleme hingewiesen hätte , sagt er. ( vbr )
The Jackson County ( MS ) Republican Executive Committee has passed a resolution in support of auditing the Federal Reserve .
I ’m announcing it because I think it is important that the local parties assert conservative and classical liberal principles such as those in the 2008 platform to the State and National parties .
The State and National parties seem to be to some degree captive to those moderates who would triangulate our principles into irrelevance , and with our principles withering into irrelevance so too our party .
Actions are necessary .
Resolutions are the first step .
Jackson County Republican Executive Committee
Resolution in support of The Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2009 Whereas , we , as Members of the Jackson County Republican Executive Committee applaud transparency and accountability in government and reject government secrecy involving monetary policy that impacts the entire economy ; and Whereas , serious discussions of proposals to oversee and audit the Federal Reserve are long overdue ; and Whereas , the Federal Reserve can enter into agreements with foreign governments and foreign central banks and the United States Congress is prohibited from overseeing these agreements ; and Whereas , we , as Members of the Jackson County Republican Executive Committee , believe agreements made by the Federal Reserve with foreign powers and foreign banking institutions should be subject to Congressional oversight ; and Whereas , the United States Constitution , gives the United States Congress the authority to coin Money and regulate the value thereof and does not give Congress the authority to delegate control over monetary policy to a central bank ; and Whereas , auditing the Federal Reserve will allow Congress to assert its constitutional authority over monetary policy and help to protect the value of the United States dollar ;
Therefore , BE IT RESOLVED , that we , the Members of the Jackson County Republican Executive Committee , in defense of the United States Constitution , STRONGLY URGE the Mississippi Congressional Delegation to support the Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2009 .
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED , that we , the Members of the Jackson County Republican Executive Committee , recommend adoption of this resolution by the Central Committee of the Mississippi Republican Party , and recommend that the Central Committee forward their adopted resolution to the Republican National Committee with their recommendation for adoption .
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED , that copies of this resolution be transmitted to each member of the Mississippi Congressional Delegation , the officers of the Central Committee of the Mississippi Republican Party , and Central Committee Members representing the Fourth Congressional District .
Adopted this the 14th day of May , 2009 .
signed …
Theron Furr , Chairman
Jackson County Republican Executive Committee
I urge those of my readers who are members of their own local committees , and who agree with this resolution , to pass just such a resolution and publicize it .
If you do n’t agree with this resolution , then pass other resolutions on current topics that call for conservative principles to be used on our present difficulties .

UPDATED at 11:52 p.m.
Two veteran Cleveland City Council members unexpectedly announced their resignations Thursday evening , both citing a desire for new opportunities .
Majority Leader Sabra Pierce Scott , 50 , a two - term councilwoman from Glenville , and Councilman Roosevelt Coats , 60 , the South Collinwood representative since 1987 , will step down at the end of the month .
Both are solid allies of Council President Martin J. Sweeney , who said he was unaware of their plans until 5:30 p.m .
" I 've got a couple of things to do , " Pierce Scott said in a phone interview , who added she does not have another job lined up .
" I 'm not leaving for any other reason other than it has been a great two terms . "
Coats said , " Twenty - one - and - a - half years is long enough .
It 's time to do something else .
I 'm blessed I can leave on a good note , nothing or no one is pushing me out . "
Sweeney called his colleagues late Thursday with the news .
One veteran councilman said the council president sounded stunned by the abrupt resignations .
" Surprised ?
Not totally , " Sweeney said when reached by phone .
" They were absolutely wonderful colleagues , " he added .
Council members were blindsided by the announcements .
" I am shocked and stunned , " Councilman Zack Reed said .
Coats , in a phone interview , said he plans to recommend State Rep. Eugene Miller for his job and seek Miller 's Ohio House seat .
Coats said he plans to spend more time with his family , especially his youngest son , who is 17 .
He described the legislature as less demanding and a " different mind set " as opposed to his seat on council .
Pierce Scott said she would recommend Shari Cloud , executive director of the nonprofit organization , Sankofa Fine Art Plus , as her successor .
Council protocol allows an outgoing member in good standing to recommend a replacement .
Sweeney said he met Thursday evening with Cloud and Miller .
" I look forward to working with their replacements , " Sweeney said .
Council turnover has been memorably high under Sweeney 's reign .
Last year , four council seats became vacant , including those of Fannie Lewis , who died , and Robert J. White , who pleaded guilty to a federal bribery charge .
Asked about losing two loyal allies in Coats and Pierce Scott , Sweeney , whose tenure has been tinged by scandal and unsuccessful attempts to throw him out said : " It gives me the opportunity to gain two more [ allies ] . "
Coats made his announcement in front of about 80 residents in Ward 10 Thursday night at Five Points Community Center on East 152nd Street .
Coats and Miller were both in the neighborhood where they have been working the past few months to set up a weed - and - seed public safety program .
Miller , who represents the 10th district , said he was surprised by Coats ' recommendation .
" I was shocked , " Miller said .
" I am very humbled because this was not a Eugene idea .
This was presented to me and I 'm taking it on as a challenge . "
The 34 - year - old Cleveland resident , who is in his second term as a state representative , has come a long way since he dropped out of Glenville High in 1992 .
He got his GED at age 20 and received a bachelor 's degree in sociology at Baldwin - Wallace College in 2003 .
He is working on a master 's degree at Tiffin University and plans to graduate in the spring .
Miller said if he wins Coats ' seat , he would work on public safety and economic development in the ward .
" I have a lot of work to do , " Miller said .
" I can't assume that just because they supported me as a state rep they will support me as a councilman . "
In a news release sent by Pierce Scott , Cloud said , " I will work diligently to provide leadership and service to the residents of Ward 8 and am committed to fostering partnerships and seeking opportunities to move our community forward . "
The remaining 19 council members will have the final vote on their departing colleagues ' replacements .
Council members make about $ 74,000 a year .
Reporters Gabriel Baird , Peter Krouse and John Caniglia contributed to this story .
For the past 56 years the Church of Scientology has blazed a path of headlines and mystery across the globe .
Once existing only as the idea held by a single man , the Church has grown into a multinational , highly organized institution in record time .
There is little doubt that trends in the 60’s and 70’s of both counter - culture and new - age thought contributed to the break - neck speed of the Church ’s growth , allowing its numbers to swell worldwide to figures that cannot be accurately counted , but are said to number in the millions .
Despite the great successes the CoS has enjoyed over the last half - century , the ubiquitous Church has been embroiled in scandal since its inception .
At the heart of every matter of contention lies the bottom dollar .
Though self - described as a religious ministry , the CoS tries to operate more like a not - for - profit international charity , and has repeatedly been accused of actually being a for - profit business .
Criminal activities , both proven and alleged , span the entire length of the Church ’s short lifespan .
Here we take a look at 16 victims of the most egregious offenses allegedly committed by the Church of Scientology to date .
Patrice Vic
Patrice Vic was a 31 year old Parisian family man with a wife and two children .
He was relatively happy , until he took a Scientologist ’s questionnaire , and was subsequently convinced that with the Church ’s help , he could be even happier .
That step only cost him 3,000 francs .
He became obsessed , and distant .
His wife even tried to save their marriage by going with him , and subjecting herself to an “ audit , ” which made her so uncomfortable that she halted the process and left .
On the advice of the Church supervisor present , Mr. Vic stopped speaking to his wife altogether , and became more detached than ever .
He started taking vitamins , supplied by the church , and underwent regular counseling at the local Church center , spending more and more of his dwindling funds as he went .
Finally , late one evening while in bed next to his silent wife , Patrice Vic got up and said quite simply “ this is the only solution . ”
He took a running dive over their 12th story balcony to the street below .
As it turns out , Mr. Vic was unable to either find the money , or secure the loans necessary to pay for the 30,000 franc “ inner purification ” procedure he was assured would fix his broken life .
Susan Meister
Susan Meister was an impressionable young woman who found Scientology in 1970 ’s San Francisco .
She was incredibly devoted to her new purpose in life , very motivated , and overzealous .
She repeatedly tried to pressure her parents into joining the then - fledgling Church of Scientology .
She wanted so badly to be a part of the inner workings of the Church , that after a year in the city , in 1971 she joined the now infamous “ Sea Org . ”
Within a month she made her way all the way to the flagship of Scientology ’s miniature naval fleet , the Apollo .
This was a great honor , as it was the seaborne home of L. Ron Hubbard himself .
Just a few short months later , Susan ’s father would be making his way to Morocco , to identify the corpse of his daughter .
When asked about the strange circumstances of Susan ’s death , he replied that she was “ lying on a bunk , wearing the new dress her mother had made for her , her arms crossed with a long - barreled revolver on her breast .
A bullet - hole was in the center of her forehead and blood was running out of the corners of her mouth .
I began to wonder how Susan could possibly shoot herself in the center of her forehead with the long - barreled revolver . ”
There were no powder burns on Susan ’s forehead , either , her father noted .
Raul Lopez
When Raul Lopez was critically injured in a head - on collision in 1985 , doctors told him he was lucky to even be alive .
The irreparable brain - trauma that was slowly killing Mr. Lopez was also impairing and degrading his mental faculties over time , but he still had most of the multi-million dollar settlement resulting from the wreck that nearly killed him .
Then he found the Church of Scientology .
The CoS told him that they could succeed where modern medicine had failed , and heal Mr. Lopez .
By the time Mr. Lopez realized he had been duped , and fired his Scientologist lawyer / conservator , he had given the Church 1.3 million .
The CoS maintains that there was never any wrongdoing , since the mentally - impaired Lopez had willfully participated .
Mary Florence Barnett
Flo , as she liked to be called , was the Mother - in - law to David Miscavige , who after Hubbard ’s untimely demise took power within the Church .
In Hubbard ’s absence , Miscavige took on the roles and responsibilities that could be equated to those of the CEO of a corporation .
At the time of her death , Flo had become entangled in some of the Church ’s worst sequences of in - fighting .
She had been following a splinter - sect within the Church that had been declared apostate , and the fact that she was directly linked to Miscavige was a constant source of embarrassment to both him and his wife .
At the height of the scandal , Flo was found dead in her bedroom , a victim of suicide , as it was initially called .
She had been shot three times in the chest , and once in the head with a .22 caliber Ruger semi-automatic rifle , which was found near the body .
Roxanne Friend
Roxanne Friend , a former Scientologist , described her experience at the Church ’s “ Flag ” facility in depositions for a law suit she filed against the Church in 1999 .
Ms. Friend had been “ forced ” to participate in practices of which she did not want to be a part .
When she attempted to leave the facility she was stopped and not allowed to leave .
She was held there for several months , and denied proper treatment for both Mono and Pneumonia .
She was not allowed to see her father when he travelled to see her , nor was she allowed to attend a wedding , at which she was slated to be Maid of Honor .
A year later , she tried to re-enter the Church in Florida , and was forced back into the initial procedure she refused in California .
When she tried to leave at that point , she was taken , placed under guard , monitored , cut off from communication outside , and finally drugged only to be transported to another location where she was held for over a month .
Paulette Cooper
In 1973 , Paulette Cooper , then a journalist in New York , found herself under federal indictment for sending bomb threats to the Church of Scientology .
What was happening would come to be known as Operation Freakout .
As Ms. Cooper was in the business of publishing books speaking out against the Church of Scientology , she was made a target , with the express goal of “ to get P.C. incarcerated in a mental institution or jail , or at least to hit her so hard that she drops her attacks . ”
The actual internal CoS documents for this officially - named project were acquired during an FBI raid of CoS offices in 1977 , which in turn cleared Ms. Cooper of the earlier charges for which she had been indicted .
CoS members had stolen stationary from her home , along with the means to recreate her finger prints , and forged the bomb - threats .
They also sent letters to her neighbors declaring that she had venereal diseases , and imported her books to countries with libel laws that allowed them to sue her overseas , for what she had written stateside .
They even found a women with similar voice characteristics to make threatening phone calls to arab consulates in New York City .
The harassment did n’t stop there ; graffiti with her phone number was found throughout the city , the IRS was told that she had lied to them on tax returns , men would seek her out and date her , only to be discovered as Scientologist “ agents , ” and legal documents were stolen from her lawyer ’s office in attempts to gain an edge on any of the 14 different law suits filed against her .
Quentin Hubbard
L. Ron Hubbard ’s son , Quentin , was 22 years old when he died in 1976 .
Sources who later left the organization have stated that Quentin was “ an embarrassment ” to Hubbard .
In fact , upon hearing of his son ’s apparent suicide , Hubbard ’s only expressed concern was over the publicity problems the event was sure to cause .
Quentin was found on the side of road , in his car , with a hose piping exhaust fumes into the cabin .
He was unkempt , unshaven , sitting next to an empty bottle of liquor , missing his wallet , and with needle - tracks in his arms .
The license plate was missing from his car .
Quentin Hubbard was well - known among his friends for being meticulous about his appearance , and always clean shaven .
His friends also noted that he did not drink or use drugs of any kind .
Casey Hill
In 1984 the Church of Scientology in Ontario , Canada sparked what would become an expensive battle with Crown Attorney Casey Hill .
They inevitably lost the fight , though it tooks several years of litigation , and smear campaigning against not only the government lawyer but also the court and ministry he represented .
In an attempt to sabotage the prosecution of a case against them , the local CoS had a practicing barrister of the court stand on the front steps of the courthouse in full garb and proclaim that he was initiating criminal contempt proceedings against Mr. Hill , who was prosecuting the case against them .
Hill , in turn , sued for libel .
The ensuing court battles that took place would cost Hill tens of thousands of dollars and his name was smeared in every newspaper in the northern hemisphere .
Later , court judgements amounting to a 129 page document would reveal findings that the CoS had in fact willfully engaged in a seven - year long campaign to ruin Hill , stating that “ Scientology decided Hill was the enemy and it set out to destroy him . ”
When all was said and done , the Church was ordered to pay the largest ever sum awarded for libel in Canadian history , at 1.6 million dollars .
Francis Diamond
In 1981 , an antique dealer in Clearwater , Florida , was committed to a mental hospital after being declared insane .
Francis Diamond , who was 45 at the time , led a happy if somewhat mundane life before the Church of Scientology moved into town .
Scientologists frequented his store , and he befriended many of them .
It was n’t long before he began reading the literature they gave him , and he decided to get audited .
Not long afterward , the police had placed him in special custody pending the court ’s ruling on his sanity .
He stood before a judge , and explained that other Scientologists ’ “ Thetans ” had invaded his body .
Three of them , in fact , and they wanted him dead .
According to Diamond , these Thetans drove him to smoke five packs of cigarettes a day and overeat until he had gained 50 pounds .
When asked why he had not done something about what was happening to him , he told the court that he feared not only his reputation , but the Church ’s retaliation .
Diamond had absolutely no history of mental illness or propensities towards mental illness prior to his “ auditing . ”
Jennifer Stewart
in 2000 , a 16 - year - old Jennifer Stewart , raised as a Scientologist , became a supervisor , under a man named Gabriel Williams .
Williams , then 27 , lived with his fiancee at the time .
Stewart ’s new working hours were to be from nine in the morning to nine at night , so the Church ordered her to move in with Williams at his San Jose residence .
The first night she stayed there , she reports , Williams raped her , and continued to do so for months .
Stewart believed at the time that if she had gone to the police , that she would have been made to see a psychiatrist , something that is beyond unacceptable in Scientology .
A member of the CoS Office of Special Affairs told Stewart ’s father that if he were to say anything , she would be taken away by child - services .
Williams was arrested in 2002 , and Stewart married her boyfriend , Tom Gordon .
the couple moved in with Gordon ’s family .
That ’s when the Gordons began receiving death threats and harassment phone - calls on a regular basis .
The message delivered was quite clear ; “ SPs do n’t live long .
Your son and his wife , Jennifer , will be dead soon . ”
SP is a Scientology phrase meaning Suppressive Person , or enemy of the Church .
Maria Pia Gardini
Maria Gardini was a Class Nine Auditor for the Church of Scientology .
She originally entered the Church through her daughter , who had learned of it through Narconon .
Maria was very good at what she did , and made the Church millions of dollars through her work .
She was a member of the Sea Org. , which by Church rules , means that not only her room and board , but also her own auditing are supposed to be covered by the Organization .
Maria was told by her superiors that it would be selfish for her , who had money , to take such charities from the Church , and that she should be donating her money for the betterment of the CoS .
When she realized that nobody else paid the amount of money she was being made to pay , she demanded her money back .
She was coerced into taking only a portion back , and being content with it , while her own supervisor bought a 40,000 dollar car with the commission she got for Maria ’s money .
After several more attempts to get her money back , in 2001 , Maria contacted the Lisa McPherson Trust to request that they assist her in reclaiming the 1.5 million dollars she lost .
Jeremy Perkins
On March 13th , 2003 , which also happens to be L. Ron Hubbard ’s birthday , Jeremy Perkins stabbed his mother 77 times with a 12 inch kitchen knife .
He did not want to take the vitamins that the Church had given him , nor did he want to take a shower , both of which his mother , also a Scientologist , had tried coaxing him into doing .
Professionals believed that , had Jeremy been on proper medication , under actual medical care , his mother would still be alive today and he would be functional .
Jeremy was fully delusional and believed at the time that his mother was not only trying to make him worse with the vitamins , but that she had an “ evil eye . ”
Jeremy stood alone in court , a murderer .
Nanna Anderson
In 1985 the CoS decided it was going to infiltrate the Ontario Medical Association .
They sent Nanna .
Nanna was only 17 when she joined the Church , and at the time , a doctor who was also a member of the Church had convinced her that she had cancer .
She was asked to get money from her family , in order to pay for treatment , and 10 % of that was a commission to the doctor .
She had signed a vague loyalties contract that she was told had authority anywhere , so when she left England to move to Ontario , Canada , the Church maintained control over her .
She got a job working for the OMA , and began the long process of siphoning information for the Church .
She also divorced her husband , because Church heads had told her he was bad for her .
She described the loyalty simply , stating that “ if they said march , I would march . ”
After hearing her story the court dismissed charges against her , and she turned State ’s Evidence .
Gabe Cazares
Clearwater , Florida has been a nexus of activity for the CoS , to include illegal activities .
Cazares spoke out publicly against the Church when they arrived in the town in 1975 ; the Church immediately fired back with a smear - campaign of the usual sex- allegatons , and also attempted to set him up in a staged hit - and - run car accident .
Cazares had n’t been saying anything that was n’t clearly visible already to the public ; he called out the Church for the quiet way they went about buying any property in town they could get ahold of , and questioned why a church would need a security force to begin with , much less one that carried clubs .
Again , internal documents were obtained during a federal raid on CoS offices detailing plans and operations in regard to Clearwater politics , and Cazares in particular .
In the criminal investigations that followed , 11 CoS officials were jailed for breaking into federal offices .
Cazares later filed suit against the Church for 1.5 million dollars in damages , which was settled out of court in 1986 .
He filed several more times in the years since .
Lawrence Wollersheim
Mr. Wollersheim reveals that in 1969 , when he joined the Church , he signed a “ billion - year ” loyalty contract .
He found himself confined to the hold of a ship , off the coast of California , which he described as a “ thought - reform gulag . ”
His mental state steadily degraded until he came just short of the point of suicide , and it was later discovered that he suffered from bi-polar disorder .
As psychiatry is forbidden , he had to choose between leaving the Church or suffering the consequences of his mounting problem .
He had already paid the Church 150,000 dollars when he decided to leave .
He filed suit in 1980 , and won millions of dollars in court awards .
The Church had no intention of paying him , however , and an ensuing legal battle raged on for over a decade .
Wollersheim created a website , FACTNet.org , to inform the public of the illegal activities carried out by the CoS .
Lisa McPherson
Lisa McPherson joined the Church of Scientology at the age of 18 , and in 1994 moved to Clearwater , Florida .
The following year , the Church noticed problems with Lisa , and placed her in a status of “ Introspective Rundown , ” and three months later was declared “ clear ” again .
Two months later , she was involved in a minor car accident that resulted in a suspected head trauma , but she refused further evaluations in lieu of treatment from the Church instead .
She was transported to the Flag Land Base and subjected to another “ Introspection Rundown , ” and placed on an “ isolation watch . ”
In the last 17 days of McPherson ’s life , her health quickly deteriorated past the point of emergency .
She was kept in isolation and denied proper medical attention .
Other Scientologists who inquired about her care were told to “ butt - out , ” and a Scientologist doctor prescribed her both Valium and antibiotics , without seeing her .
When the decision was made to take her to a hospital , the execution was curious .
Four hospitals were passed along the way , and upon arrival she had flatlined .
The personnel at the emergency room attempted resuscitation for 20 minutes , but Lisa McPherson was already dead .
During her autopsy , the corner said she had likely died of a Thrombo - embolism , caused by severe dehydration while lying in bed .
The coroner also noted several bruises , and abrasions consistent with animal bites .
The Church called her family and told them that she had died from either Meningitis , or a blood - clot , while at Fort Murray for rest and relaxation .
In May of 2004 , a civil suit filed by her family against the Church was settled .
Current State of Gambling in the USA
Online gambling in the United States has gone through a pretty rough time period over the last 15 years .
Recently , political opinion has reversed again , and states have begun taking measures to return online gambling to full legal status .
These actions have gained the attention of federal lawmakers , who have recently introduced legislation to create a legal framework for online gambling at the federal level .
For now everything is at the state level and it is up to each individual state if they want to regulate and make online gambling legal .
The UIGEA ( Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act ) was passed by the House and Senate in September 2006 and George Bush signed this act into a law in October 2006 .
The Safe Port Act was a bill to improve security of the United States Ports .
The UIGEA was added to the Safe Port Act at the last minute .
The UIGEA does not prohibit online gambling !
It outlaws financial institutions from transacting with online gambling companies .
The UIGEA did not ban online gambling , instead it banned gambling financial transactions and the problem is that the UIGEA is so vague that banks have found it impossible to enforce .
There are a select few of safe and legal gambling sites that still accept American players ; be smart and select a popular gambling site approved by GamblingUSA.com and other reputable sites .
We have researched all these gambling sites listed on this site – we have played at all of them and still play at our favorites .
The current state of online gambling in the United States is different for each state .
Nothing has changed on the federal level , so it is up to each state to pass it ’s own specific laws about legal / illegal gambling .
As with anything that involves government making a change , it is a slow process .
The states seem to fit into 3 groups :
Pro Online Gambling Group –
All for regulated ( taxed ) online poker and / or gambling ( For example : Nevada , New Jersey , Delaware ) and ready to jump out in front and be a trendsetter .
Wait and See Group –
This is where the majority of the states are sitting .
They are not against online gambling , but want the other states and service providers to work out the kinks and to gather data .
These states will expect a smooth launch of online gambling .
Anti Online Gambling Group – Conservative states that are absolutely against gambling and especially gambling online ( For example : Utah & Hawaii ) .
Ok , But is it Legal ?
In the state of Nevada , residents have a few choices to legally gamble online .
One of the legal sites is called WSOP.com .
It ’s a small poker site run through Nevada ’s Station Casinos , but any poker player will tell you there is n’t enough action on that site to make a living .
The United States government is n’t trying to prevent professional gamblers from earning a living .
They just want you to wager at local casinos .
Why do they care where you gamble ?
There are two reasons .
The first reason is because they are too clueless to realize the revenue potential online gambling would bring in .
In fact , it ’s somewhat silly given the current state of our economy that gambling online is n’t legalized .
If the US government were smart they would regulate online gambling and force online gamblers to give Uncle Sam a percentage of their earnings .
Instead , they allow us American citizens to ship our money overseas in order to gamble online .
The second reason gambling online is illegal – okay , mostly illegal – is due to the local casinos crying foul .
State governments force local casinos to pay a hefty sum in taxes each year .
Because of that , the state governments will bend over for them .
Local casinos are opposed to online gambling because they feel it kills their revenue .
If you can legally gamble online you ’re less likely to drive to a nearby casino to gamble , or so they think .
I ’m not saying legalizing online gambling would n’t hurt local casinos .
I really do n’t know .
I ’d have to see an extensive study to prove one way or another .
But I can guarantee they would n’t lose out on as much revenue as they think .
Online gambling may not be legal right now , but that does not stop us from gambling online .
If the government allowed us to gamble online legally , would revenues decrease much at local casinos ?
I do n’t think so .

The government has given the go - ahead for a new generation of coal - fired power plants - but only if they can prove they can reduce their emissions .
Up to four new plants will be built if they are fitted with technology to trap and store CO2 emissions underground .
The technology is not yet proven and would only initially apply to 25 % of power stations ' output .
Green groups welcomed the move but said any new stations would still release more carbon than they stored .
Energy Secretary Ed Miliband 's announcement followed confirmation in the Budget that there would be a new funding mechanism for at least two - and up to four - " demonstration " carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) projects .
Stations closing
He told MPs it would allow the UK " to lead the world " in the technology - and keep coal within the UK 's energy mix without abandoning climate change commitments .
It is not clear where the new plants will be located although the government said areas where the greatest benefits could be generated included parts of Kent and Essex , Humberside , Teesside , Firth of Forth and Merseyside .
In 2008 coal power stations provided 31 % of the UK 's electricity but a third of them are due to close in the next ten years .
There is no alternative to CCS if we are serious about fighting climate change
Ed Miliband Coal is the dirtiest fossil fuel but is likely to remain widely used across the world because it is cheap and relatively abundant .
Mr Miliband said there was an " international imperative to make coal clean " and said the era of " unabated " growth in coal - fired plants was over .
He said only allow new coal stations fitted with CCS would be allowed to be built in England and Wales .
Higher bills
The technology would at first have to cover between 20 and 25 % of the station 's energy output .
Once it is " independently judged as economically and technically proven " - which the government expects by 2020 - those stations would have five years to " retrofit " CCS to cover 100 % of their output .
Mr Miliband said successful CCS development could cut carbon emissions from coal by 90 % .
This statement is urgently needed because after 12 years Britain 's energy policy is as much of a horror show as our public finances
Greg Clark
Conservatives
He told MPs the move put the UK " in a world leadership position on CCS and coal " .
" There is no alternative to CCS if we are serious about fighting climate change and retaining a diverse mix of energy sources for our economy , " he added .
One publicly funded project had already been planned and the additional ones will be funded through a scheme which will guarantee the price companies receive for electricity generated by CCS .
Mr Miliband said that would add an estimated 2 % to energy bills by 2020 .
Shadow energy secretary Greg Clark welcomed what he called the government 's " Damascene conversion " to CCS adding : " This statement is urgently needed because after 12 years Britain 's energy policy is as much of a horror show as our public finances . "
For the Lib Dems , Martin Horwood was concerned that by only insisting on 100 % CCS use when the technology was deemed ready , Mr Miliband had inserted a " dirty great loophole big enough for some of the dirtiest power stations possible to fit into " .
The announcement was welcomed by trade unions who said it could create thousands of jobs , avoid energy shortages and put the UK at the forefront of a technology that could cut carbon emissions across the world .
But while environmental groups welcomed an end to unabated coal fired stations - there were concerns about increased emissions .
Greenpeace executive director John Sauven said that for every tonne of carbon captured before 2020 , three would be released into the atmosphere .
Some concerns were raised that billions of pounds of taxpayers ' money was being spent on technology that remains unproven .
WWF - UK's Keith Allott said the taxpayer should not have to " shoulder the full brunt of the costs " and the " polluter " should make significant financial contributions .

Walt Whitman H.S. students shout down anti-gay protesters Muriel Kane
Published : Friday April 24 , 2009
Print This Email This The Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka , KS is notorious for its tasteless and frequently nonsensical anti-gay protests .
Not only do they picket the funerals of victims of anti-gay hate crimes , but they have been known to protest concerts , football games , and even a hardware store selling Swedish vacuum cleaners .
Most recently , they have been busy picketing the funerals of soldiers killed in the Iraq War , believing their deaths to be a judgment on America .
However , the Westboro protesters may have overreached when they attempted to picket Walt Whitman High School in Bethesda , MD , named after the nineteenth century poet who many biographers believe to have been either homosexual or bisexual .
According to the Potomac Almanac , " When Whitman sophomore Ryan Hauck first heard about the scheduled protest at Whitman from a friend he thought it was a joke .
Then he went online ... and saw just how serious the church is .
' I was just shocked just from the second I heard it and I knew I had to do something , ' Hauck said .
' [ It was ] the hatred of the whole thing that shocked me . ' "
Hauck was aided by his fellow - sophomore Amar Mukunda , who " set up a Facebook group to generate support for the counter - protest through which more than 600 students have committed to attend .
Mukunda said he doesnt expect that many to show up on Friday , but that he does expect a healthy turnout . "
As it happened , the turnout far exceeded Mukunda 's expection of " a couple of hundred . "
The Washington Post reports that " faculty had spun the event into an interdisciplinary lesson .
English teachers spent the day teaching Whitman 's verse .
Social studies teachers led a unit on tolerance .
Math teachers fanned through the crowd , attempting a head count . "
Although the handful of picketers initially had the street to themselves , that changed dramatically when school was dismissed at 2:10 and five hundred students marched out , chanting the school name alternating with " Go home ! "
LGBT group Driving Equality had even set up a " Phelps - a - Thon " webpage , promising , " For every minute the ' God Hates Fags ' clan is protesting , we will be collecting donations for the Walt Whitman High School gay / straight alliance .
...
You can pledge any amount you chose , whether it be $ 0.25 , $ 0.50 , $ 1 , or even $ 2 for every minute they protest .
...
After the event , we will send Phelps a thank you card , telling him how much money he raised for LGBT equality . "
Many of the students in the counter - protest were wearing T - shirts bearing a picture of Whitman and the line , " Let your soul stand cool and composed . "
However , far more sarcastic commentary on the day 's events was provided by blogger Oliver Willis , who had taken note of the upcoming protest when it was first announced in March .
" I gotta say , " Willis wrote , " if they re devoting time and resources to protesting Walt Whitman they must have an insane amount of time on their hands .
Leaves of grass , indeed . "

Architecture and Shadows
Michael Blowhard writes : Dear Blowhards --
Another in a series of postings designed to wake a few websurfers up to elements in the experience of the built environment that are simple , important , and too - often - overlooked .
Listen up , America , goddammit .
Today : light and shadows .
And a fast comparison to kick us off .
First , traditional brick and stone : Next , mid-20th century modernism ( the UN building , in fact ) : Ignoring many of the worthwhile observations that could be made about this juxtaposition , for today I want to ask :
What 's the main difference between the above images in terms of light and shadow ?
Obvious answer : Traditional architecture - and - urbanism offers loads more in the way of light / shadow delight than modernist architecture - and - urbanism does .
Another comparison .
First up , some modest tenement apartment buildings :
Look at the variety of shapes made here by the light and the shadow .
Take note of the way the light and shadows emphasize mass -- those buildings feel solid .
Do n't let your eyes be shy about taking the ironwork -- the fire escapes -- into account .
Those rungs , diagonals , slats , and verticals add a dimension that is n't to be ignored .
They remind us not just of the sun but also ( because they change so markedly as the day goes by ) of the passage of time .
You might say that , given the density , touch , and complexity of detail and texture , this view looks and feels like a painting .
Now , a brand - new apartment building in the current wobbly / off - kilter mode recently erected just a few blocks away :
What 's the experience of light - and - shadow here ?
Not to be coy , let me suggest that the easiest answer is : " None whatsoever . "
I get " gleam , " I register " glassy , " and I certainly pick up on " swoopiness . "
What I do n't get is any of this : solid , deep , substantial , calm , organic , complex .
The whole structure in fact looks like it was extruded direct from a plastics factory .
Or maybe it's a screencap taken off your computer 's screensaver .
But do n't some modernist ( and modernist - derived ) buildings at least try to take the light - and - shadow thing into account ?
Sure -- not many , not often , but still .
So what 's the result ?
Let 's take a look .
Mid-20th century modernism : Hyper-recent :
There 's certainly some contrasts going on here between light and dark .
No arguing about that .
But what 's the effect ?
What I mainly pick up from these attempts is n't " the human touch , " it 's " geometrical abstraction . "
In fact , let me go a little further with that reaction :
What I really pick up is " rabid , monomaniacal devotion to geometrical abstraction at all costs . "
Human ?
Only if your idea of " human " is Arnold in the first " Terminator " movie .
A reminder of something we can all recognize as human : Check out the patterns of light and shadow in that modest row of houses , and let the implications , suggestions , and meanings of those patterns ricochet around your brain a bit .
Shelter ...
The human touch ... Organic matter ...
Evolved , near - biological shapes and forms ...
A quick revisit with the values the architectural establishment prefers :
The word " bleak " might well present itself here .
So might " flat , " " abstract " and " reflect-y . "
Let me venture another word too : " unwelcoming . "
OK , it 's a little interpretive and judgmental .
But is it far off ?
Is modernism -- as some of its partisans claim -- just another style , to be indulged as one member of a large , loving family ?
Or is it ( as I maintain ) a hostile disruption of a great and rewarding tradition , a finger in the face of a major evolved human accomplishment , namely traditional architecture and urbanism ?
Well , in the next photo , how much do the two buildings have in common ?
" Disruption " does n't seem like too strong a word to me .
But how can we be sure that people genuinely prefer organic , complex light - and - shadow patterns that combine regularity and chaos ?
( Note : not " random noise " but " chaotic elements . " )
Besides :
Where 's our vision ?
Where 's our imagination ?
Why limit ourselves to what 's already been done ?
Easy response .
Here 's a traditional space in a traditional park :
And here 's a recent creation :
In a traditional space , people gather willingly and happily , while the chic , design -y space puts people off .
( Worth keeping in mind is a term the academic establishment likes to use : not parks but " empty spaces , " or " public spaces . "
Gotta love that kind of medical - scientific neutral " objective " terminology .
Gotta wonder too what effect using terms like those have on the brains of those in the " design community . " )
How much is there to the observation that trad work combines regularity ( balance , rhythm ) with chaos ( ie. , natural patterns and the unexpected ) ?
It 's basic , really .
Here 's a closeup to illustrate how this works :
You have your grid -- ie. , your regularity .
But you also have your irregular qualities too : the fingernail - like scrapes , and ( quite strikingly here ) what 's called the " rustication " of the large stone blocks .
It 's all artfully enhanced , of course .
But a good park is similar -- a harmonious conversation between the natural and the artificial .
Looking at the closeup above , you can pretty much weigh , feel , and measure the mass and depth of those columns , stones , etc .
In fact , these feelings probably reach deep into you ; they strike off sensuality and imagination .
It 'd be fun to make a drawing of that , right ?
After all , there 's a lot there for your senses and brain to get absorbed in , and to engage with .
My park - vs - empty - space comparison was fun , no ?
But was it a fluke ?
Another example .
Trad park : Modernist empty space :
The elements in the trad park are straight out of " pattern books " -- accumulations of structures , shapes , and things that have proven to work , and to work together , as well as the formulae by which to assemble them .
The modernist space is all concept and geometry .
Another thing to notice :
No attention whatsoever has been paid by the modernist designers ( or by the people who commissioned this work ) to supplying a light - and - shadows dimension that everyday people will enjoy .
Result : People do n't settle into this space , they hurry through it .
One of the bigger mysteries of contempo buildings and design :
Since the " what do people , left to their own devices , prefer ? " experiment has been run so very often by now , why do architecture schools and the people who commission big projects ignore this body of readily - accesible knowledge ?
But do they ?
You bet .
To illustrate , here 's an architectural - training drawing from the traditional world : Notice how directly and matter - of - factly the drawing takes the whole light - and - shade thing into account .
Here 's a CAD drawing from the contempo world : Seems fair to call this image airless and lightless , no ?
It may or may not be reasonably nifty as a piece of two - dimensional design .
But clearly no attention whatsoever has been paid to texture , or to light and shadow , or to the effects of them .
That 's right : Traditional architecture training and practice routinely took note of light , air , texture , and shadow -- more generally , of how things would feel .
Modern architecture students are not only often able to avoid basic drawing training , they 've never had it pounded into them that patterns of light and shadow ( and what these elements and qualities imply and call to mind ) are one of the major ways by which buildings and spaces affect us emotionally .
It 's as though they 're being deliberately trained to be tone - deaf to the ways the rest of us will take their work .
( By the way , I 'm aware that CAD drawings can be made that are as attentive to texture , depth , and light - and - shadow as traditional drawings are .
The point is n't that it can't be done , it 's that it 's seldom done . )
So the modernist world goes on subjecting us to what it has always promoted -- concepts , geometry , glassiness , steeliness -- with ever - more - absurd and inhuman results .
Let me end with a snap of one of NYC 's brand - new bus stops :
Yep , that really conveys " shelter , " does n't it ?
As you might suspect , the architecture establishment has given our new bus stops a number of awards .
Bonus links :
An example of what the cool kids consider to be exciting design .
See - through plastic tubing rocks , apparently .

Since the " what do people , left to their own devices , prefer ? " experiment has been run so very often by now , why do architecture schools and the people who commission big projects ignore this body of knowledge ?
They do n't ignore it .
They actively work against it .
The point of modernist buildings is precisely to make people feel like sh*t .
The political and corporate powers that commission big projects do so deliberately to impress upon the masses the powers ' own ineluctable , faceless , crushing inhuman eternal presence .
They want you to feel stressed , unwelcome , down and out and low and weak and small .
And they want to push everywhere into the human world to impress everyone in that world just how worthless , powerless and secondary they are .
Was n't that droopy apartment building raised up in your neighbourhood , Michael ?
Why do you think they raised that thing so sloppy - high that you can't ignore anywhere in the Village ?
That 's the point of the exercise .
The wealthy get to look down on your charming boho walkups and human scale streets and parks ... and you get to look up at that thing .
What is so sickening is how little effect the opposition has had on this .
It 's still going on !
Osama bin Laden , I asked before and ask again , where are you now that we need you ?

Seems this is another manifestation of political correctness emanating from our nation 's campuses .
Architecture so featureless and bland , it 's only intended purpose is to offend the least amount of people possible .
We 've sterilized our speech , why not our buildings ?
Posted by : Bill on May 8 , 2009 1:55 PM
Coming from L. A . I grew up around a lot of crappy architecture along with a lot of really amazing architecture .
I do n't mind the lack of shadows , but maybe that 's the Califonian in me .
There were never that many shadows around anyway .
What I mind is the lack of quirkiness and charm .

A picture like this , it makes me want to cry , it 's so beautiful .

Posted by : Bryan on May 8 , 2009 2:22 PM
I think something should be said about the cost- cutting that modernist architecture provides .
From what I understand , the materials and labor involved to build your typical modernist glass building cost much less than to build a traditional building .
Another factor would be structural soundness and flexibility .
Out here in California , modern buildings , while not usually as aesthetically pleasing as the older buildings , are much more stable during an earthquake .
I 'm open to someone with more experience in these matters to correct me .
I 'm only going by what I 've read .
I 'm not advocating for modernism .
In fact , almost all modernist exteriors are ugly as shit .
But I do n't think it 's as much of a conspiracy thing as some others so .
FWIW , the most pleasing and functional buildings for me , particularly in a house , have a traditional exterior and a modernist interior .
My ideal is basically a remodeled brownstone , craftsman or Victorian .
Spacious modernist inside and organic goodness outside .

There were three great eras in human - centered architecture : Greco -Roman ; Renaissance , which fused Greco - Roman principles with individualism ; and Beaux - Arts , the late 19th century eclecticism that took innovation even further , but was still conscious of its roots .
( I deliberately omit Gothic , which for all its magnificence is n't human - centered , but God-centered . )
The ancient Greeks and Romans had very specific ideas about space and proportion , following templates that seemed to them to be part of the natural order of things .
You can argue with that , but it's hard to doubt that they knew something important about what makes buildings and spaces fit for people .
As we 've lost our connection to classicism , we 've lost the intellectual or intuitive grasp of earlier generations of architects that enabled them to create joy for the eye while designing structures that fulfilled a function .
Lacking — no , contemptuous of — that tradition , modern architects can only make an egotistic " statement . "
The results are n't always terrible , and occasionally are both striking and attractive , but even then the viewer is n't quite satisfied : he senses , even if unconsciously , that this was n't made for him , but for an architect 's and corporation 's vanity .
The other reason modern architecture is usually hellishly impersonal , at least in cities , is world overpopulation .
A proliferation of high - rises results , and the higher the building , the more difficult it is to give it human meaning .
Its very height tends to overwhelm us .
The world should make a conscious decision to reduce its population by two - thirds at least , and then reset is aesthetics to traditional architectural standards .
Posted by : Rick Darby on May 8 , 2009 4:24 PM
The problem is which two - thirds to cut .
Volunteers are in short supply .
I think Michael 's comment about the older building looking hand - made underscores a dismaying general trend - outsourcing our aesthetics to machines .
Take music , now many vocalists are recorded with auto - tune , and the general effect of modern recording is to make music machine - perfect .
The effect is the same as the glass box skyrise , the texture is impoverished .
After many years working with synthesizers and digital recording , I 've switched to acoustic piano .
Pianos are still handmade so each one is unique , even two of the same brand and model will be distinct .
I love my piano , I have warm feelings toward it as an object ( thought not sexual yet ) .
I have never felt that way about a mass - produced assembly line product .
Some can be beautiful objects , for sure , but ultimately I 'm left cold .
As JV points out , it 's cheap to make buildings the modern way , at least in the short term .
We 've exchanged fewer , but more human artifacts for a overabundance of indifferent shite .

You can kinda tell that these designers are n't the type that spend much time outdoors lounging .
I do n't think that comfort and organic is impossible under the modern rubric , just not under the design principles of today , which is all steel and glass .
There 's room to innovate , frex there 's this bank building in my hometown that looks like a cross between some Polynesian coral megaliths and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon .
Very modern , yet very pleasing to look at , due to the resemblance to white coral and the deeply recessed windows with Bougainvillea planters in them .

Why are we filling our skylines with off - putting spaceship styled buildings ?
Because there is a push to escape upward out of the cityscape , to blast off .
Architecture as escapism .
Architects like the challenge : " How can I take steel and glass and stone , things of this earth , and make them look un-earthly ?
Would n't that be a good trick ? "
Let 's not forget , however , that buildings are not only experienced from the outside but also from the inside .
One wonders how well some these structures work from the inside out and what kind of experience they afford internally .

Gentlemen , you make me blush !
The problem with Roissy's is there are too few comments from the likes of PA , Thursday and some others ( our friends Clio and Michael B , Johnny Five , the marvellously tungsten - spined OMW , Days of Broken Arrows , some others ) to make visits to the comments section really worth the time .
Are things improving over there ?
P.S. I , ah , do n't exactly get along with the proprietor of the place , although he can be amusing .
His epitaph for post - modern ultra- feminized America is a classic :
Here lies America
She achieved closure
But I can just read his stuff and skip the 800 + comments fests that consist of interminable exchanges between the same five people , half of whom seem to be latent homosexual neo -Nazis ( wait , that 's redundant ) .
Also , if chic noir is n't commenting there , I 'm not interested either .
Chic is sweet and beautiful within and without and I miss her [ faints dead away !
drops to the floor !
eyes roll back in head ! ] interjections .
To say nothing of Hope , whom I supposedly " drove away " .
Sigh .
My adventures in Roissy 's chateau were of a mixed , not to say , bittersweet nature , to say the least .
Sigh .

Which reminds me of a posting I 've wanted to do ...
To give away the punchline ( and why not ? ) :
The way the history of the skyscraper has been presented is all wrong , and is modernist myth .
According to the usual , early skyscrapers ( like the Woolworth ) were bumbling , misguided steps along the path to glass - and - steel geometry .
Clarity , truth , and inevitability all demanded that we shake free of all that masonry and all those columns and decoration -- that it's in the nature somehow of the Platonic skyscraper we all aspire to to be " pure " -- geometry , glass , steel , etc -- and that it took the architecture world a few decades to achieve .
My retort : baloney .
There 's nothing Platonic , pure , or inevitable ( let alone desirable ) about geometry , glass and steel , even where tall buildings go .
And the first few decades of skyscrapers were n't a mistake but instead the high point of skyscraper creation .
What you see with the Woolworth etc is n't pure form yearning to get free , it 's the creative and admirable efforts of talented designers and buildings to incorporate the new possibilities offered by new building and construction materials and techniques into the fabric of western civ .
OK , the building was going to be really high ( and would need elevators , etc , and the stone / brick / masonry would n't be load - bearing ) -- given all that , how do we make it play ball with everything else we already have , and which helped us get to this point ?
The columns and decoration on early skyscrapers do n't represent any kind of failure ; they represent the most - excellent efforts of people to make their work contribute to the fabric of existing society .
The way the modernists tell the various stories of art history are real traps .
They structure these stories so that their own eminence and importance look inevitable , and un-quarralable - with .
They want to make it impossible to take issue with their work and with their position in society .
" It 's simply the case that glass - and - steel - and - geometry is where it was all headed , " for example .
No it was n't .
That was a particular taste - set that a particular bunch of people got behind ( and which the rest of us have disliked ever since ) .
" All painting leads to Impressionism which in turn leads to cubism etc " -- that 's another example .
And bullshit to 'em all .
We badly need more accounts , and a wider range of accounts , of art history than what we 're usually given .
BTW , I hope everyone realizes that that 's part of what Donald 's up to with his appreciations of popular and figurative artists .
Me , I mostly just complain about what we 're given .
Donald 's actually contributing a new account .

BTW , everyone go click on the link Bryan supplied in his comment .
It really is to weep , but in a good way .
As for the cost of building ... I only know what I 'm told .
But what I hear is a few things .
1 ) these glass and steel things wo n't last more than a few decades .
2 ) they 're cheaper than building in trad styles , yes , but only because of the way that mortgages , financing , write - offs , etc are structured these days -- in other words , as with factory food and suburban sprawl , the system has been optimized to make it easy to create a certain kind of product , and has been biased against what many if not most people would in fact prefer .
3 ) if you 're thinking about the long term , it makes far more sense to build in trad styles and using trad techniques .
Your building will actually physically last , and it wo n't go out of fashion .
But the social - political - economic structures that have been put in place make it next to impossible for people to concern themselves with the long term .
If anyone has better info or actual personal experience with these matters , please let us know about it .
As for me ...
Well , I 'm certainly not shy about looking at the bulbous - swoopy new architecture and seeing in it a visual - physical representation of the crazy economic - financial world of the last decade .
Swoopy glass=credit - default swaps , or something like that .
May it all come tumbling down ( and let 's forget about " stimulating " it back to life ) .
Back to basics , that 's me .

It was astonishing to me to see in the panorama to which Bryan linked , a vision of a truly modern city ( the truly modern city , the IMO pinnacle of achievement of the modern industrial age , to whit early 20th century Manhattan ) , a truly modern city that in its organic wholeness , its intricacy of pattern and structure , of light and shadow , of material and form in perfect unity , was somehow also perfectly traditional , in the C Alexander / Salingaros / paleo / Scrutonian sense (s ) of the word .
That link did make me weep , because it showed that there is NO intrinsic opposition between modernity and tradition .
NONE AT ALL .
We had it , right there in NYC , in the Manhattan skyline , the perfect almost Platonic embodiment of modern energy and ambition and skyward drive , joined somehow in a kind of complete Aristotelian hylomorphic unity with traditional life , human scale , this actual earth , with intricacy , pattern and , and ... life , dammit !
Life !
That 's what hurts about that great link from Bryan ... Manhattan is so damned modern and so damned alive .
We had it .
We had it whole .
We KNEW HOW TO DO IT .
And we let it all go .
Yes , to look at that picture is to weep .

As with various other socio-political and aesthetic discussions here , there are curious contradictions between the positions taken on various topics .
Here we have a perennial favorite 2BH post with blame for our built environment being heaped on architects and academics with scant attention to the place of global , corporate , free market capitalism in the equation .
Why ?
Because to examine too closely the underlying economic forces that have produced the vast quantity of blank glass and steel box buildings being dissed would point out that the fault lies mostly with " conservative " corporate clients and real estate developers rather than the commie - lefty - academic wing of the elite .
As Michael notes , " the stone / brick / masonry would n't be load - bearing , " this , therefore , means that the added construction costs associated with such elements ( which would , not so coincidentally , go primarily to skilled , often unionized , blue collar tradesmen and artisans ) are easily deemed unnecessary .
This means architects suggesting such aesthetic , but non-structural , elements are highly likely to find those suggestions easy line items for the CEO of Acme Global Widgets , Inc. to trim from the budget for the new headquarters .
So , if the clients are going to reject them anyway , why not accept the inevitable and design another variation on the type of building they will actually green - light ?
As the current state of Wall Street and Detroit can attest , for decades the " free market " business model mantra has focused on next quarter numbers at the expense of long - term thinking .
Since this thinking is the POV of most of the clients and funding sources for the sort of large scale urban architecture being discussed here , does n't it make more sense to castigate the financiers , real estate developers , and corporate clients more than the starcitects ?
Similarly , the park vs. " public space " images make their case as much or more through the choice of camera angles , time of day , weather and temperature variables as by any intrinsic virtues or defects in the spaces themselves .
( Note the bare trees in the ' public space ' image . )
FWIW , I 'm one of those folks who love a wide array of " traditional " architectural styles as well as much of high and post modernism .
Shadow , light , human scale details , naturalistic elements , and craftsmanship are all wonderful attributes in architecture .
Still , if you 're going to cast about for villains in this area maybe you should be looking more at corporate board rooms rather than architectural studios .

Chris -
Do your glasses need polishing today ?
I 'm always careful in postings like these to mention the people who commission this work as well as the designers .
A couple of examples from this posting : " No attention whatsoever has been paid by the modernist designers ( or by the people who commissioned this work ) to supplying a light - and - shadows ... " ;
" Since the " what do people , left to their own devices , prefer ? " experiment has been run so very often by now , why do architecture schools and the people who commission big projects ignore this body of readily - accesible knowledge ? "
And from a comment of mine along the way : " I 'm certainly not shy about looking at the bulbous - swoopy new architecture and seeing in it a visual - physical representation of the crazy economic - financial world of the last decade .
Swoopy glass=credit - default swaps , or something like that . "
If you 're taking this blog to be an advocate of globalizing neoliberalism I 'm completely flabbergasted .

Bryan 's linked photo was sumthin ' else !
I first visited NYC in 1956 and spent many weekends there 1962 - 63 when I was in the Army .
Thanks to the Depression ( there 's something good in almost everything ) , there was n't much new construction in Midtown from 1932 to 1950 aside from Radio City ( as it was called ) .
So by the time I got there , Park Avenue was only part way into its transformation and Sixth Avenue was barely getting going -- the Time - Life building was up along with maybe a couple of others .
I am pleased that I was able to witness what was classical 1930 - vintage New York when it was still the dominant style .
This makes me feel sorry for younger readers who have to work a lot harder to view that New York in person .
I liked your discussion of light and shade .
It makes lots of sense .
Think of all those Beaux - Arts school wash rendering where sunlight is assumed to be falling at a 45 - degree angle .
Some newer modernist buildings make an attempt at creating depth .
But this is often done by layering glass and support structure elements , the result akin to viewing an object through clear plastic theft - protection packaging .
I 'll post a photo or two sometime unless you beat me to the punch ( and feel free to do so ) .

Cass Gilbert , who designed the Woolworth , was born in Zanesville ( home of the Y - shaped bridge ) and grew up in St Paul .
He also served a term as president of the AIA .
It 's funny to compare the AIA 's laminated guides to the downtowns of St Paul and Minneapolis .
They were clearly written by different people , with different mindsets .
St Paul 's lovingly describes all the old buildings , several by Gilbert , and a few going back to the 19th century .
( Michael might have written it . )
The Minneapolis guide , in contrast , focuses on the new , with only a couple token old buildings mentioned .
The Art Deco cluster on or just off Marquette Ave is left off altogether .

Was the United States more or less capitalist when the New York of Bryan 's link was being built ?
Do the new buildings look more or less like something from modern North Korea in contrast to buildings from New York in 1932 ?
Maybe the logical conclusion is that as progressives get more power they tend to push things toward the Soviet model in various ways .
Untangling the influences that lead to these effects is complex but as progressives get more power , something pushes everything in the direction of the Soviet Union from the 1950s .
It 's not technical and organizational improvements because USSR circa 1955 was n't the peak of human civilization .
Something else must be pushing that way .

Thanks for the survey of photos .
It 's like you made a compilation of the things I see every day that bothered me about modern architecture but did n't realize until I started reading this blog .
I worked in the building in the last shot of " Modernist empty space " ( the one with the Heartland Brewery ) .
That space was hugely unfriendly .
Just behind where the photo was taken are some long curved marble benches .
They do n't even fit people 's backs .
To sit on them you need to lean forward and rest your elbows on your knees .
The whole area is unpleasant most of the time .
Too hot in summer ( with no shade ) , too cold in winter ( with nothing to block wind ) .

" Was the United States more or less capitalist when the New York of Bryan 's link was being built ? "
Steve , I would say it was a different type of capitalism back then , but not sure it was more or less .
Not as globalized , governments not as much under the control of corporations , etc .
I 'll agree that the architects who came up with modernism were probably leftist , but the corporations that gobbled their designs up were mostly not .
Posted by : JV on May 10 , 2009 12:40 PM
The architects who came up with modernism were not so much leftist , though most of them were , as disdainful of the middle class .
Philip Johnson was a fascist sympathizer , but that was okay , because fascists disdained the bourgeoisie as much as did radical lefties .
The point of modernist architects , who are really just toadies , courtiers if you will , is to aid their masters , patrons , funders , government and corporate , with buildings that oppress the middle class , make them feel powerless and alone , and which violate their values , especially pleasure , comfort and life at the human scale .
This is precisely the point : to impress upon the middle classes that they not only have no say in the buildings they live and work in , but to actively assault their sensibilities , making their lives materially and spiritually less rewarding , more stressful , just plain worse every single day of their lives .
Thereby , of course , putting them firmly in their place .
Pour epater le bourgeois !
cried the bohemian rebel when asked to justify his disturbing art .
Same thing today , except that the bohos are n't rebelling anymore .
They 're working for the Big Boys now , helping keep the ordinaries , the yous and mes , the people , in their lonely , atomized , stressed , exhausted and compliant place .
This goes way beyond leftism .

When Prince Charles bemoaned the the damage that the modernest architects did to England it was the architectural profession , not the capitalists , who viciously attacked him and ridiculed him .
Patrick H : The architects who came up with modernism were not so much leftist , though most of them were , as disdainful of the middle class .
Disagree : The Early modernists saw themselves as vanguards of the new political man .
Their disdain of the middle class -- from which many of them came -- stemmed more from the values they had , i.e traditional Western Culture , than their material status ; they were anti Western Culture .
The Modern Architects saw themselves as more than building designers , they were designing new ways of living .
Le Corb 's plan to demolish widespread sections of Paris was based on the fact that He as architect , was better able to orginise people 's lives then they themselves were .
The Traditionalists never thought that way , they wanted to make beautiful and impressive buildings that would impress the man on the street and not just their architectural colleagues .
The traditionalists were concerned about beauty , the modernits ideology .
Posted by : slumlord on May 10 , 2009 6:09 PM
Let me try this from another angle .
You offer a critique of modernist architecture and urban design examining the element of light and shadow , geometric versus organic elements , architectural drawing versus CAD renderings .
The comments thread immediately agrees that modernist architecture is terrible .
But rather than sticking to aesthetics , the comments relate it to politics .
Giving Patrick the benefit of the doubt I 'll presume he did n't fully consider what he was saying when he longed so wistfully for Osama bin Laden to grace us with an encore after his earlier critique of modernist architecture , accomplished by destroying the most prominent modernist buildings in NYC a while back .
It seems to me that we set up this artificial construct that is built around an all - inclusive right / left polarity .
Bankers are right , artists are left ; traditional architects are right , modernist architects are left .
If you 're on the right you say government is inept and bureaucratic while the private sector is efficient and productive ; if you 're on the left you say government is inept and bureaucratic , but all we have to restrain the global corporations , which are rapacious to the point of plundering the planet to insure the next round of bonuses .
My initial comment was , therefore , venting about ( a ) dragging politics into it , while ( b ) doing it myself by attempting to say that in all but a tiny number of signature , starchitect - designed , building projects the real choices and decisions are made by the guys with the money .
How I think about aesthetics seems , in many ways , to be similar to Michael 's , although we obviously part company on certain details .
The primary aspect I 'm thinking of is the non-hierarchical , non-judgmental , " take - it - all - in " attitude Michael shows toward music and porn and so on .
Regardless of what genre , style , or school of art , or in this case architecture , it seems to me very few practitioners produce great works , many are competent yet uninspired , many are also dreadful .
When it comes to the built environment , planning and zoning , and aesthetics I have far fewer complaints about buildings like the curvy luxury condos than I do about all the gianormous WalMarts ' big box stores squatting in the middle of acres of macadam all over the place .
And , while I love most new or old New England extended farmhouses or a shingle style " cottages " , I find many of the larger residences done in " contempo - trad " style to be distorted and ungainly , their traditional elements emphasizing that they have the architectural equivalent of a thyroid condition .

-- Slumlord
And this differs from Baron Haussmann in that ...?
Much of what we celebrate in Paris is the result of Haussmann 's arrogance , which , unlike Corbusier 's , had concrete results .
Like with Corbusier , it was all slum clearance ( tell us , " slumlord " ! ) and eminent domain .
Politically , they were on the same page ; æsthetically , they were in different wings of the library .
Haussmann had taste .
Another difference : Haussmann was a native Parisian .
He was working on his city .

The Left / Right divide is a consequence of one 's chosen metaphysical position .
One 's metaphysics also influences one 's concept of beauty and eventually architecture .
When it comes to the built environment , planning and zoning , and aesthetics I have far fewer complaints about buildings like the curvy luxury condos than I do about all the gianormous WalMarts ' big box stores squatting in the middle of acres of macadam all over the place .
I do n't know why , because both aesthetic monstrosities originate from the same school of thought .
The WalMart is the apogee of the form follows function school of thought .
Old Right fogies like myself would argue that that judgments about architecture are quite valid since there are better and worse forms of architecture .
New and exciting is n't good enough , beautiful and enduring have more substance .
The Old architecture worked , and I do n't mean just Classical Western Architecture .
Asian , Indian , Spanish and Islamic architectural forms seem to please in a way that Modernism does n't .
I think the dividing line between Modernism and the rest lays in the concepts of decoration and scale .
Modernism specifically rejected ornament and modern technology put no limit on scale .
Michael , for what its worth , I think the Woolworth building is beautifully decorated but originally it was massively out of scale ; it 's probably one of the few skyscrapers that has aged well because as New York became more populated with skyscrapers its scale has become more appropriate .
When an architect is not allowed ornament , distinction can only be achieved through different forms and different construction materials .
Weird shit boxes of any scale and novel materials are the inevitable consequence .
The old architecture was all about rules .
Windows should have a certain proportion , columns should have a certain spacing and so on .
The mouldings that were so liberally applied were designed to cast pleasing shadows for the benefit of the onlooker .
In fact all the rules were based upon what people naturally found attractive .
Above me , as I type , is a book , " The Theory of Mouldings " , it 's a whole book about how to cast light and shadow to make a building interesting .
Whats interesting about the book is that it's also a book that recongises human nature and extols architects to design around it .
Modernism cast the rules aside .
Still Chris , to be fair , you 're right that it 's not only the architects who are responsible for the current urban decay .
All the shit boxes were paid for by someone who controlled the purse strings .
All those bureaucrats , town officials , CEO's and nouveau riche , through considered choice , paid for the rubbish .
The modern urban environment is a result of the aesthetically devoid being funded by the aesthetically challenged .
In a poorer age of robber barons , money was always found for decoration and ornament , in our more affluent and environmentally responsible age , we 're too tight to spend on those goods .
J.P. Morgan dressed better than Warren Buffet .

Old Right fogies like myself would argue that that judgments about architecture are quite valid since there are better and worse forms of architecture .
Whereas an old fogie like me would argue that there are not better or worse forms of architecture per se , but that a given building needs to be considered in context .
A 55 story modernist tower might blend in with little difficulty in NYC or Chicago and be an enormous eyesore ( or aspirational pinnacle of achievement ) in Ithica , NY or Billings Montana .
It is also worth noting that in the images offered the traditional buildings with admirable decoration are all relatively small ( under 10 stories ) whereas the glass & steel boxes are generally very tall skyscrapers .

Do fire escapes actually do any good , or are they just a regulatory excrescence ?
We do n't have them where I live , in Stockholm , essentially a whole city of 4 - 6 storey buildings , and I have n't heard about an epidemic of fire deaths .
And yes , the facades do look better without fire escapes .
Our bus stops are more or less identical to yours , however , but with a much higher frequency of kicked - out panes , since we drink so spectacularly heavily at weekends .

That 's what the modernists are trying to evoke -- awesomeness .
In both senses of the word .
PatrickH picks up on the sense of " to be awed is to be overpowered " .
But sometimes you want to be overpowered .
A cool building * is* supposed to impress you .
I mean , do you want a corporate HQ or research lab to look like a boring 50's headquarters ?
That aerial shot of 1932 Manhattan has a lot of boringly similar buildings .
I mean , what 's wrong with a building which just evokes thoughts of whiz - bang technology from the outside ?
As long as the inside is climate controlled with T1 jacks , terraformed gardens , whooshing and silent elevator banks , and a 24 hour gym ... that 's functional from the inside yet cool from the outside .
( All that said , Michael Blowhard is onto something with that stone stuff .
Big f'ing stone in a grid .
Looks sick .
You could make an extremely cool building by taking stone and fusing it with a modern sensibility -- titanium + glass + stone ) .
