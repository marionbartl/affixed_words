IGF is seen as a showcase for the best indie talent A topless game developer and games about nature and paint spattering were the big winners at the Independent Games Festival Awards .
The 11th annual IGF awards are seen as the equivalent of the Sundance Festival for the video game industry .
The IGF exists to reward innovation and excellence in independent games .
Fairytale exploration game BlueBerry Garden won the top prize , the $ 30,000 ( £ 20,400 ) Seumas McNally award .
" Indie games are pushing the envelope and getting great critical acclaim , " said IGF 's chairman Simon Carless .
This year there were 226 games in competition with a further 145 entered for the student prize .
This demonstrates a " period of massive growth in the number and quality of independent developers , " Steve Swink of Flashbang Studios told the audience .
" The world is catching on .
Game journalists , industry and yes players are beginning to appreciate indie games .
" The game playing public is beginning to understand that a tiny team with a brilliant vision can make better games than people with a corporate mandate and millions of dollars to spend .
The world is realising that as much as they love big budget shooters , they are hungry for new types of experiences , " said Mr Swink .
Mr Carless told the BBC he agreed the indie movement is moving out of the closet but that the big issue now for consumers is one of choice .
" There is an infinite amount of games , especially thanks to digital distribution .
But there is a problem and that is a choice problem .
" Just like music on the web , you can get millions of different bands .
In gaming the problem is for the indie to differentiate themselves from other indies .
In the end it will all be down to the quality of your art , " he said .
The awards tend to be closely watched by the mainstream game makers looking for new ideas because the festival is viewed as showcasing the best in the indie sector .
Previous winners have included World of Goo , Castle Crashers and Braid .
Top honours
Top honours on Wednesday went to Blueberry Garden , a fairytale exploration game set in an ever changing ecosystem .
All the drawings for the game were done by hand Creator Erik Svedang , from Sweden , said the game was inspired " from growing up and playing in the woods and the Swedish west coast " .
" It 's a lot about nature and the beauty of nature .
with a very singular vision . "
David Lagardere who created the music said he believed their approach set a benchmark for other indie developers .
" We used a Common Licence from the internet and this is something that will get big in the indie industry given all the talk about copyright .
It means you can upload your music and protect it with some sort of licence and that 's really great and other developers should be encouraged to do this , " he said .
Mr Svedang said winning was an " awesome honour " and the money was a great boost which he might use to create another game .
Audience Award
In most festivals the audience award is among the most coveted because it is voted for by peers .
This year more than 4,000 developers took part .
The clear favourite was Cortex Command , which also picked up the Technical Excellence Award .
Double winner Dan Tabar of Data Realms was so amazed that he ripped of his t- shirt when he got on stage .
Hamming it up for the cameras did n't result in extra votes for Dan Tabar
This labour of love has so far taken eight years and is set in the future world of " cybernetica " where a severed brain controls many types of bodies remotely from various locations like an underground bunker , spaceship and turret .
" I originally started the game to teach myself game development and here we are eight years later and I am now vowing to get it finished .
It 's nearly finished , " said Mr Tabar .
Even though he has worked for other unnamed gaming studios , Mr Tabar admitted he liked the freedom of being an independent .
" No one else can tell you what to do .
Sure it 's a shoe - string budget but you are only answerable to yourself .
You shoulder the responsibility yourself which can be scary but also liberating because no one is putting limits on your ideas . "
Innovation Nuovo Award
This is the first year the IGF has had an innovation award , aimed at " honouring titles that are pushing the boundaries of what games are and thinking about the medium in a whole new way . "
Between claimed a brand new award
The IGF said these games represented " what punk is to pop , what nipple rings are to belly - button rings , and what Mohawks are to fauxhawks " .
The first recipient was Jason Rohrer 's two - player collaborative title Between .
" I 'm amazed I won because this game is the hardest to understand and people have told me they are confused by it .
It 's about consciousness and isolation which I hardly even understand .
" It certainly pushed my boundaries as a creator .
The whole time I was making it , I could n't believe it I was unleashing this on the world .
It was like a piece of concept art .
Just something I had to do , " Mr Rohrer explained to the BBC .
Point and click
The second winner , Machinarium , is a point and click game that consists of hand drawings .
" My inspiration were all those old movies and animated movies , old adventure games and mother nature itself , the best muse , " said Jacob Dvorsav from the Czech Republic .
" This was a tough category and shows just how the industry is blooming and really experimenting with new ways to do games , " he said .
Excellence in Audio Sound is generally the unsung hero in gaming .
It might not get as much kudos as the graphics and storyline , but it is an integral part of the game .
A total of $ 55,000 in prize money was awarded to developers
This year 's award was given to Brainpipe by Digital Eel which uses " ear tickling sound effects and immersive dreamscape music " .
One of the brains behind it is Mr Phosphorous who goes by the title of Game Oracle at the company because he " provides dim illumination to my co-workers .
He told the BBC that it was truly rewarding to receive the prize and that it meant " the little guy can win and still do good and do something to be proud of and be acknowledged for " .
Student Showcase
This years IGF said it received a record number of student entries , up 15 % on last year to 145 .
They came from three different continents and ranged from ecological games to fantasy exercise games and paint spattering .
Tag : The Power of Paint was devised by six students at the DigiPen Institute of Technology in Seattle .
The students will get to share a prize of $ 2,500 Spokesman for the group , Tejeev Kholi said they were so sure they would not win that they did not even bother trying to practice pronouncing the names of the other nominees .
He admitted he hoped the prize would " open a lot of doors for them .
It just shows anyone can make a game and make it for free .
Then if you are good enough you will get an award " .
Other awards went to KranXProductions ' Musaic Box for Excellence in Design Award and Osmos by Hemisphere Games won a $ 10,000 prize for Direct2 Drive 's Vision Award .

When John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt wrote about “ The Israel Lobby ” in 2006 , many supporters of Israel were outraged .
How , they wanted to know , could anyone say that the United States offered “ unwavering support ” to Israel ?
Worse yet , how did these two misguided professors dare suggest that there was a cabal of die - hard Zionists in the media , in Congress , in the Pentagon and in neocon think tanks working to ensure that U.S. policy did not deviate from the pro-Israel party line ?
The debate was ferocious ; the world ( or at least the part that cares about these things ) divided along angry partisan lines .
Mearsheimer and Walt were shouted down in many quarters as anti-Semites .
Needless to say , no resolution was reached , and eventually the furor died down .
Several weeks ago , however , it re-erupted after President Obama appointed Charles W. Freeman Jr. , a former U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia , as chairman of the National Intelligence Council .
Vehement objections came from several of Israel ’s most loyal supporters in Congress , from some journalists and lobbyists known for their strong support of the Jewish state , and from other members of what some would no doubt call , well , the Israel lobby .
Freeman was not the sort of person they were ever going to like .
He once said that “ the brutal oppression of the Palestinians by the Israeli occupation shows no sign of ending . ”
He also said : “ American identification with Israel has become total . ”
Israel , he once said , “ excels at war ; sadly , it has shown no talent for peace . ”
Those are certainly provocative statements .
On the other hand , Freeman was backed by a group of 17 former U.S. ambassadors who described him as a man of integrity who “ would never let his personal views shade or distort intelligence assessments , ” and defended by Director of National Intelligence Dennis C. Blair , who called him “ a person of strong views , of an inventive mind in the analytical point of view . ”
But Freeman ’s critics kept at him , and on Tuesday , Freeman withdrew from the appointment .
Afterward , he was blunt : “ The tactics of the Israel Lobby plumb the depths of dishonor and indecency ” and reflect “ an utter disregard for truth . ”
Our opinion is this : Israel is America ’s friend and ally .
It deserves to exist safely within secure borders .
We hope it will continue to prosper as a refuge for Jews and a vibrant democracy in the region ( alongside an equally democratic Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza ) .
But we do not believe that Israel should be immune from criticism or that there is room for only one point of view in our government .
U.S. policy has been extremely supportive of Israel over the years , as have many of our policymakers .
That ’s fine .
But theirs should not be the only voices allowed in the room .
One envious holidaymaker complained that his friend ’s three - bedroom apartment was “ clearly bigger ” than his one - bedroom place , while others could not hide their frustration that it took them nine hours to fly back to England from Jamaica when it only took the American travellers a mere three hours to get home .
From HaskellWiki
An applicative functor has more structure than a functor but less than a monad .
See the Haddock docs for Control .
Applicative .
Example
It has turned out that many applications do not require monad functionality but only those of applicative functors .
Monads allow you to run actions depending on the outcomes of earlier actions .
do text <- getLine if null text then putStrLn " You refuse to enter something ? " else putStrLn ( " You entered " ++ text )
This is obviously necessary in some cases , but in other cases it is disadvantageous .
Consider an extended IO monad which handles automated closing of allocated resources .
This is possible with a monad .
openDialog , openWindow :: String -> CleanIO ( ) liftToCleanup :: IO a -> CleanIO a runAndCleanup :: CleanIO a ->
IO a runAndCleanup $ do text <- liftToCleanup getLine if null text then openDialog " You refuse to enter something ? " else openWindow ( " You entered " ++ text )
The ( fictive ) functions openDialog and openWindow could not only open dialogs and windows but could also register some cleanup routine in the CleanIO .
runAndCleanup would first run the opening actions and afterwards the required cleanup actions .
I.e. if the dialog was opened , the dialog must be closed , but not the window .
That is , the cleanup procedure depends on the outcomes of earlier actions .
Now consider the slightly different task , where functions shall register initialization routines that shall be run before the actual action takes place .
( See the original discussion started by Michael T. Richter in Haskell - Cafe : Practical Haskell Question )
This is impossible in the monadic framework .
Consider the example above where the choice between openDialog and openWindow depends on the outcome of getLine .
You cannot run initialization code for either openDialog or openWindow , because you do not know which one will be called before executing getLine .
If you eliminate this dependency , you end up in an applicative functor and there you can do the initialization trick .
You could write
initializeAndRun $ liftA2 ( liftToInit getLine ) ( writeToWindow " You requested to open a window " )
where writeToWindow registers an initialization routine which opens the window .
Usage
If you have the variables
f :: a -> b -> c a :: f a b :: f b
you can combine them in the following ways with the same result of type f c :
pure f <*> a <*> b
lift A2 f a b
But how to cope with let and sharing in the presence of effects ?
Consider the non-functorial expression :
x :: x g :: x -> y h :: y -> y -> z let y = g x in h y y
Very simple .
Now we like to generalize this to
fx :: f x fg :: f ( x -> y ) fh :: f ( y -> y -> z )
However , we note that
let fy = fg <*> fx in fh <*> fy <*> fy
runs the effect of fy twice .
E.g. if fy writes something to the terminal then fh <*> fy <*> fy writes twice .
This could be intended , but how can we achieve , that the effect is run only once and the result is used twice ?
Actually , using the liftA commands we can pull results of applicative functors into a scope where we can talk exclusively about functor results and not about effects .
Note that functor results can also be functions .
This scope is simply a function , which contains the code that we used in the non-functorial setting .
liftA3 ( \ x g h -> let y = g x in h y y ) fx fg fh
The order of effects is entirely determined by the order of arguments to liftA3 .
Some advantages of applicative functors
Code that uses only the Applicative interface is more general than code that uses the Monad interface , because there are more applicative functors than monads .
The ZipList is an applicative functor on lists , where lift A2 is implemented by zipWith .
It is a typical example of an applicative functor that is not a monad .
interface is more general than code that uses the interface , because there are more applicative functors than monads .
The is an applicative functor on lists , where is implemented by .
It is a typical example of an applicative functor that is not a monad .
Programming with Applicative has a more applicative / functional feel .
Especially for newbies , it may encourage functional style even when programming with effects .
Monad programming with do notation encourages a more sequential & imperative style .
Applicative transformers
From the Monad Transformer Library we are used to have two flavours of every monad : a base monad like State and a transformer variant StateT .
In the transformers package we even have only monad transformers except the Identity monad .
So where are applicative transformers ?
The answer is , that in most situations , we do not need special transformers for applicative functors since they can be combined in a generic way .
h :: f ( g ( a -> b ) ) a :: f ( g a ) lift A2 ( <*> ) h a :: f ( g b )
That is , lift A2 ( <*> ) is essentially the definition for <*> for the composition of the functors f and g .
This is implemented in the TypeCompose library as type constructor O and in transformers library in module Data .
Functor .
Compose .
The first one needs a lot of type extensions , whereas the second one is entirely Haskell 98 .
It can be useful to use the applicative composition even when you have a monad transformer at hand .
In the example above f might be Writer ( Sum Int ) that is used for counting the number of involved applicative actions .
Since in an applicative functor the number of run actions is independent from interim results , the writer can count the actions at compile time .
It is not true that transformers are unnecessary for applicatives , though .
Consider State s ( IO a ) == s -> ( s , IO a ) , which behaves like an applicative with the above trick , but it is different from StateT s IO a == s -> IO ( s , a ) .
The latter is more useful in some situations , and it is not a composition of any two applicatives .
How to switch from monads
Start using liftM , lift M2 , etc or ap where you can , in place of do / ( >>= ) .
You will often encounter code like
do x <- fx y <- fy return ( g x y )
It can be rewritten to lift M2 g fx fy .
In general , whenever the choice or construction of monadic actions does not depend on the outcomes of previous monadic actions , then it should be possible to rewrite everything with liftM .
When you notice you 're only using those monad methods , then import Control .
Applicative and replace return with pure , liftM with ( < $> ) ( or fmap or liftA ) , lift M2 with lift A2 , etc , and ap with ( <*> ) .
If your function signature was Monad m => ... , change to Applicative m => ... ( and maybe rename m to f or whatever ) .
Alternative terms
Applicative functors were introduced by several people under different names :
Ross Paterson called them Sequence
Conor McBride called them Idiom
The same kind of structure is used in the UU Parsing - Combinators .
In the latest sign of the disconnect between the legal system and an increasingly sexualized adolescent cyberculture , two 13 - year - old Pennsylvania girls are threatened with child pornography charges for sending seminude photos of themselves via cellphone to their friends .
A third girl , 16 , who sent a picture of herself wrapped in a towel at her waist after a shower , may also face charges .
“ Sexting ” or “ sexing , ” the practice of sending nude or seminude pictures via cellphone or posting them online , is on the rise .
A recent study by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy found that one in five teenagers admitting to having posted or sent a nude or seminude picture of themselves .
In another survey by wiredsafety.org , an Internet safety and educational nonprofit organization , 44 percent of teen boys said they have seen at least one naked picture of a female classmate .
Over the past year , as schools and parents in states from Ohio and New Jersey to Colorado and California have found out about the practice , prosecutors have also become involved , in some cases threatening felony charges against the teenagers .
The incidents have sparked a nascent national campaign to educate parents and change the laws .
“ The laws are either too hot or too cold and we need to make sure we find one that is just right , ” says Perry Aftab , an online safety and privacy expert who founded wiredsafety.org .
“ We are either charging kids under child pornography and sexual exploitation laws as if they were registered sex offenders – which they will be if they ’re successfully prosecuted – or we ’re giving them a slap on the wrist with harassment laws that were not intended to address this . ”
The situation in Tunkhannock , Pa. , illustrates the extent to which “ sexting ” has become part of adolescent culture and the dilemma that it presents to parents , teachers , and law enforcement officials .
Last October , officials at the Tunkhannock Area High School , which is in a rural community north of Scranton , confiscated several cellphones from students and discovered pictures of scantily clad or seminude female students on them .
Parents were alerted , and so were the police .
In November , the local district attorney sent a letter to parents stating they ’d discovered a “ disturbing trend ” and that they were investigating “ several juveniles for possessing nude or seminude photos of young girls . ”
The letter went on to warn parents of the legal consequences as well as the fact that the teens appeared to be unaware of them .
“ One young lady , when questioned about her photo being on a cell phone , called this ‘ flirting ’ , ” the letter stated .
With an estimated 20 teens involved , district attorney George Skumanick decided to try what he calls “ a progressive ” approach to the problem .
In February , he sent another letter to the teens ’ parents saying that if the students agreed to be placed on probation , submit to random drug testing and take part in a five - week counseling program , he would not press felony charges .
“ It was mainly a crime of foolishness and naiveté , so we developed a program , ” says Mr. Skumanick .
Most of the students agreed to take the classes .
But the parents of three of the students felt the district attorney had gone too far in threatening felony charges .
They went to the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , which brought suit against the district attorney charging that he was “ standing child pornography laws on their heads . ”
Sending seminude pictures is “ stupid , careless , naive , poor judgment – all of the things that teenagers are and it could have really bad consequences for the future .
But is it criminal and is it child pornography ? ” asks Witold Walczak , legal director of the ACLU in Pennsylvania .
“ These photos are not child pornography by production or by content – the Supreme Court has repeatedly said the definition of pornography is much narrower than just nudity . ”
The district attorney ’s decision to threaten child pornography charges against kids wearing underwear or in a bathing suit , Mr. Walczak says , is “ a complete abuse his authority . ”
District attorney Skumanick disagrees .
“ We tried to do what we thought was the progressive and the right thing by not charging them – by giving them the ability to avoid any record whatsoever , ” he says .
The ACLU ’s stance on the issue , Skumanick contends , would make it possible for anyone to bypass state laws and go directly to federal court charging their civil rights were violated before they were even charged with a crime .
“ That could cripple the criminal justice system , ” he argues .
A judge is currently reviewing the ACLU ’s request for a temporary restraining order against the district attorney .
A ruling is expected this week .
For cyber-safety and teen advocates trying to raise awareness of the issue , the complexities of the Tunkhannock case simply reinforce the need to educate parents about the extent of “ sexting ” and students about the potentially severe consequences of the practice .
“ Parents do not realize how widespread sexing is or how quickly the number of cases are rising , ” says Casi L. , an 11th grader at Ursuline School in New Rochelle , N.Y. , who ’s been working on cyber - safety issues since the 8th grade .
“ A lot of kids feel anonymous online so they feel more comfortable doing inappropriate things because they think they wo n’t be linked back to them . ”
The survey by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy also found that one in three young adults aged 20 to 26 had also sent nude or seminude pictures by phone or posted them online .
Bill Albert , a spokesman for the National Campaign , says he believes those numbers are low because they were self - reported .
“ We specifically put this question so that it was not open to interpretation , ” says Mr. Albert .
“ Nude is nude , and seminude is seminude .
If a person is in their bra , we would n’t classify that as seminude – if one of the 13 - year - olds involved in this [ Pennsylvania ] case took our survey she ’d check ‘ no ’ and appropriately so . ”
The survey also found that young people have mixed feelings about the practice .
The vast majority – 66 percent of teen girls and 60 percent of teen boys – say they thought of sexting as “ fun or flirtatious , ” but more than 70 percent also recognized it could have serious , long - term consequences in terms of their careers or social standing .
“ But legal consequences were very low on their list of concerns , ” says Albert .
This post is about using a genetic algorithm ( GA ) search technique to search for faster Haskell programs .
We ’ll use the GA to automatically evolve better :
and briefly consider automatic optimizing for :
So this is about how to make your already - fast Haskell programs faster without doing the hard work yourself .
I ’ll walk through the approach of using a GA library to breed solutions , and show performance improvements in already hand - optimized programs submitted to the Computer Language Benchmarks Game found by a GA search .
As a taste , the GA found an inlining hint combination resulting in an 18 % reduction in runtime for the parallel k- nucleotide benchmark ( a program that had already had extensive hand optimization ! ) .
Sweet .
Background
A modern optimizing compiler like GHC is a complex beast , with a barrage of optimizations available to transform code from lambda calculus to assembly .
GHC follows a compilation - by - transformation approach , doing as much as possible of its code improvement via “ correctness - preserving , and hopefully performance - improving , program transformations ” .
Deciding when to perform some particular transformation is hard , so instead the compiler has many , many tunable flags , as well as allowing hints in the source in the form of pragmas to let the programmer make domain - specific optimizations that may not be generally applicable .
Since the compiler does n’t always get the thresholds for optimization right , exposing , for example , inlining hints to the programmer can have significant benefits when the programmer knows something more about how the code is to be used .
I ’ve seen factors of 10 x to 100 x performance improvements in inner loops with careful overriding of the default inliner heuristics used by the “ Illustrious Inliner ” ( in Data .
Binary )
The problem is the complexity of it all .
If we have n inlinable functions or compiler flags , there ’s 2^n combinations of inlining suggestions we can give to the compiler ( double that if we start disabling inlining , and even more if we start setting particular phases ) .
Even if the programmer has a few heursitics in mind to help with pruning , the search space is still huge .
For these reasons , it is hard to know precisely when a particular flag , option , or inlining hint will be of benefit ( and the same goes for parallelism hints , and strictness hints ) .
So , let ’s have the computer traverse the search space for us .
Acovea
With a large search space for our optimization problem , one classic technique is to use an evolutionary algorithm to minimize for some cost .
And for breeding the best set of compiler flags for a given program , we can use an off - the - shelf solution : acovea
ACOVEA ( Analysis of Compiler Options via Evolutionary Algorithm ) implements a genetic algorithm to find the “ best ” options for compiling programs with the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) C and C++ compilers
Given a specification of the available flags , acovea uses these as variables to fill out an optimization search space , which it then traverses , using GA techniques to hang on to useful flags , breeding them to find a semi-optimal combination .
acovea is relatively simple to use :
Compile the C++ libs ( libevocosm , libcoyotl and libacovea )
Develop a specification of the flags to tune for your compiler ( or reuse the defaults for GCC )
Then launch the “ runacovea ” wrapper script on your program
Go away for a few hours
Come back and you ’ll be presented with suggested optimistic and pessimistic flags , best flag combinations , generally good combinations , and measurements against any baselines you set up .
I ’ve used acovea in the past ( for optimising the GCC flags used in a polymer chemistry simulation ) and in this post we ’ll see if we can adapt it to solve other kinds of optimization problems .
An example : optimising a C program
Acovea comes with some benchmark programs to test out how it works .
First , if it does n’t have a specification for your compiler , you ’ll need to make one .
A compiler specification is just an xml file with a list of all the flags you want to try permuting .
Here ’s one quick one I made for GCC 4.3 on a core 2 duo .
It sets up some baseline flag combinations that tend to be good ( - O , - O2 , - O3 ) and then lists different flags to try .
The input program must only print to standard output its “ fitness ” .
A value indicating how good this program was .
This is the value the solver will try to minimize .
By default we will time the program ’s run , and have it print that time as its fitness .
Smaller fitness numbers mean faster programs .
We can then run the evolver with a given input program and compiler spec as arguments ,
$ time runacovea - input fftbench .c - config gcc43_core2.acovea -p 5 -n 5 -g 5
For a quick test like this , we ’ll limit the size of the population of programs , the number of them , and the number of generations to run , to avoid the search taking too long .
The result when run looks something like ( when run on the fftbench . c distributed with acovea ) :
$ runacovea - input fftbench .c - config gcc43_core2.acovea -p 5 -n 5 -g 5 Acovea 5.1.1 ( compiled Feb 28 2009 09:57:51 ) Evolving Better Software Invented by Scott Robert Ladd ( scott.ladd@coyotegulch.com )
Coyote Gulch Productions ( http://www.coyotegulch.com) test application : fftbench .c test system : paprika config description : gcc 4.x Core 2 Duo ( x86_64 ) ( version 1.2.0 ) test configuration : gcc43_core2.acovea acovea version : 5.1.1 evocosm version : 3.1.0 application version : gcc 4.3.3 generation 1 complete , average fitness : 0.938262 generation 2 complete , average fitness : 0.716008 generation 3 complete , average fitness : 0.642554 generation 4 complete , average fitness : 0.73271 generation 5 complete , average fitness : 0.695639
Acovea ’s turning on and off GCC flags , and using the GA approach to find better solutions .
The end result is a number of good and bad flags ( and by how much ) :
Optimistic options : - ftree-dce ( 1.874 ) - ftree-dse ( 1.874 ) - ftree-sra ( 2.092 ) - fgcse ( 1.656 ) - fstrict - aliasing ( 1.874 ) - fsched - spec ( 1.656 ) - ffinite - math - only ( 1.656 ) Pessimistic options : - fschedule - insns ( - 2.263 ) - ffloat - store ( - 2.481 ) - funroll-all-loops ( - 2.263 ) - fbranch-target-load-optimize ( - 1.61 ) - freschedule-modulo-scheduled-loops ( - 2.045 ) - mfpmath=387 ( - 1.61 ) - mfpmath=sse ( - 1.828 )
As well as a graph of how these do against our baselines of - O1 - O2 and - O3 :
A relative graph of fitnesses :
Acovea 's Best - of - the - Best : ************************************ ( 0.537113 ) Acovea 's Common Options : ********************************************** ( 0.694453 ) - O1 : ************************************************** ( 0.743317 ) - O2 : *********************************** ( 0.524936 ) - O3 : ************************************* ( 0.549206 ) - O3 - ffast - math : *********************************** ( 0.522497 ) - Os : ************************************************ ( 0.72606 )
And the command line to use to get that best measurement ( with many of these noise with such a short search ) :
gcc - lrt - lm - std=gnu99 - O1 - march=core2 -fno-merge-constants -fno-defer-pop -fno-if-conversion2 - floop-optimize - ftree-dce - ftree-dse - ftree-lrs - ftree - sra - fcse - follow - jumps - fcse- skip - blocks - fgcse - fexpensive - optimizations - frerun - loop - opt - fpeephole2 - fstrict - aliasing - fstrict - overflow - fdelete - null - pointer - checks - freorder - blocks - fthread - jumps - fgcse-lm - fsched - interblock - funit - at - a - time - falign - functions - falign - labels - ftree - pre - fgcse - after - reload - fomit - frame - pointer - fno- inline - ftracer - fsplit-ivs - in- unroller - funroll - loops - fgcse-sm - freschedule - modulo-scheduled - loops - ftree-loop - ivcanon - mieee-fp -minline-all-stringops -mfpmath=387 -fno-math-errno -funsafe-math-optimizations -fno-trapping -math -ffinite-math-only -fcx-limited - range -o /tmp/ACOVEA30281033 fftbench.c
So in this short 5 minute run , we found a combination of flags that was pretty close to - O3 .
If we let it run overnight , it might well find a good 10 - 20 % on our best generic defaults .
Fun stuff !
Evolving a faster Haskell program
We can do the same thing with a Haskell compiler too .
First , we need a specification of the GHC ’s optimisation flags .
To start with , let ’s just use the tool to answer a couple of simple questions when developing production Haskell code :
should I use - O1 or - O2 ? should I use the C or native backend ?
To answer these questions all we ’ll start with a simple ( incomplete ) GHC specification file with just those flags available , like so :
< prime command = " ghc " flags= " -- make -v0 - fforce - recomp ACOVEA_OPTIONS -o ACOVEA_OUTPUT ACOVEA_INPUT
" /> < baseline description = " ghc - O2 - funbox - strict - fields - fvia - C - optc - O3 " command = " ghc " flags= " -- make - fforce - recomp - O2 - funbox - strict - fields - fvia - C - optc - O3 - optc-march=core2 -o ACOVEA_OUTPUT ACOVEA_INPUT
" /> < baseline description = " ghc - O2 - funbox - strict - fields - fasm " command = " ghc " flags= " -- make - fforce - recomp - O2 - funbox - strict - fields - fasm -o ACOVEA_OUTPUT ACOVEA_INPUT " /> < flags > < flag type =" simple " value= " - O " /> < flag type =" simple " value= " - O2 " /> < flag type =" simple " value= " - fasm " /> < flag type =" simple " value= " - fvia - C " /> < flag type =" simple " value= " - optc - O1 " /> < flag type =" simple " value= " - optc - O2 " /> < flag type =" simple " value= " - optc - O3 " /> < flag type =" simple " value= " - fexcess - precision " /> </ flags
A couple of things to notice here :
by default , we ’ll use –make - fforce - recomp - v0 to allow full recompilation and linking
we leave all optimisations off by default
as a baseline , we ’ll use the known “ good ” flags - O2 - funbox - strict - fields - fvia - C - optc - O3 - optc-march=core2 - O2 - funbox - strict - fields - fasm
Letting us crank up all the optimisations , and pick between the GHC backends to use .
With more time , we can traverse a larger search space , and start including more speculative GHC flags ( like - funliberate - case - threshold ) .
Also , if we really have time on our hands , we can include all the GCC flags as well ! ( - optc -… ) .
Optimizations in GHC can have a huge impact , which is good when we ’re searching for them , but GHC is also somewhat problematic , as ( afaik ) there are optimizations baked into the - O and - O2 levels that we ca n’t turn on or off via flags .
As a result we must always include - O and - O2 as available optimisations in our spec .
Some sample GHC flag specifications are here :
Note the last one defines a monster search space of 2^120 flag combinations .
Timing a Haskell program
So now we ’ve got a spec for GHC , let ’s try to see if it can find some sensible flags to optimize our program .
We ’ll use as input an obsolete language shootout benchmark – recursive – since it ’s small .
I ’m hoping it will tell me that either - O2 - fasm or - O2 - fvia - C - optc - O3 is sensible .
First , we have to modify the program to emit its fitness , not some other output ( but we have to be careful to also not avoid doing work … pesky lazy languages ) .
To do this , I change the ‘ main ’ function to contain the following wrapper :
import Text .
Printf import Control .
Exception import System.CPUTime import Control .
Parallel .
Strategies import Control .
Monad import System .
Environment import System .
Posix .
Resource n_str = " 9 " main = do setResourceLimit ResourceCPUTime ( ResourceLimits ( ResourceLimit 10 ) ( ResourceLimit 10 ) ) start <- getCPUTime
... do guts of program ...
end <- getCPUTime let diff = ( fromIntegral ( end - start ) ) / ( 10 ^12 ) printf " %0.4f " ( diff :: Double ) return ()
I ’ve set an arbitrary upper limit of 10 seconds on the program ( which Acovea seems to take into account as a failure ) , and then we measure the cpu time the program gets .
I also have to be careful to replace any IO functions with code that forces the data to be evaluated , but does n’t print it out .
`rnf` comes in handy here .
We also have to modify the program to parse its arguments from a string , not the command line .
So now our program prints out its fitness ( in cpu itme ) when run :
$ ghc - O2 -- make A.hs Linking A ...
$ time ./A 0.3366
. /A 0.34s user 0.00s system 97 % cpu 0.350 total
I expect - O2 - fasm to be around the best we can for this program ( possibly - O2 - fvia - C - optc - O3 ) .
Evolving a better set of GHC flags
We can now bring the two together and use the GA lib to find a good set of flags for this program .
Note : GAs are slow to converge on a good solution .
$ runacovea - input A.hs - config ghc.simple.acovea -p 5 -n 10 -g 10
generation 1 complete , average fitness : 1.62956 generation 2 complete , average fitness : 1.10506 generation 3 complete , average fitness : 0.808408 generation 5 complete , average fitness : 0.548018 generation 7 complete , average fitness : 0.458966 generation 8 complete , average fitness : 0.458832 generation 9 complete , average fitness : 0.387232 generation 10 complete , average fitness : 0.376632
Acovea 's Best - of - the - Best : ghc -- make - v0 - fforce - recomp - O - O2 - optc - O2 - optc - O3 - fexcess - precision -o /tmp/ACOVEA13339961
A.hs Via C baseline : ghc -- make - fforce - recomp - O2 - funbox - strict - fields - fvia - C - optc - O3 - optc-march=core2 -o /tmp/ACOVEA6310E069
A.hs Via native codegen baseline : ghc -- make - fforce - recomp - O2 - funbox - strict - fields - fasm -o /tmp/ ACOVEA19AF21AF
A.hs A relative graph of fitnesses : Acovea 's Best - of - the - Best : **** ( 0.3433 ) Acovea 's Common Options : ************************************************** ( 4.1731 ) Via C : ***** ( 0.4433 ) Via - fasm : **** ( 0.3733 )
Cool .
Now the results are interesting :
the difference between no optimizations and the optimized result is more than a factor of 10 .
the best measurement was taken with - O2 - fexcess - precision ( this uses the native code generator , not the C backend ) the final results include noise ( e.g. without - fvia - C the - optc - flags have no effect ) GHC ’s native code gen outperformed the GCC backend on this code .
It would be useful to have a “ shrinking ” phase at the end to remove noise ( the way Quick Check does ) .
But for now we can do that by hand , meaning that acovea believes
ghc - O2 - fasm - fexcess - precision
is the way to go here .
Let ’s check the assembly for the best variants .
For just the fibonacci function , where GHC first specialises it to Double , ( where most of the benchmark ’s time is spent ) we get from the native code backend :
Main_zdwfib1_info : .Lc1 Iv : leaq - 16 ( %rbp ) , %rax cmpq %r14 , %rax jb .
Lc1
Ix ucomisd . Ln1IC ( %rip ) , %xmm5 jae .Lc1
Iz movsd . Ln1ID ( %rip ) , %xmm5 jmp *( %rbp ) .
Lc1 Ix : movl $ Main_zdwfib1_closure , %ebx jmp *-8(%r13 ) .Lc1
Iz : movsd % xmm5 , %xmm0 subsd . Ln1IE ( %rip ) , %xmm0 movsd % xmm5 , - 8 ( %rbp ) movsd % xmm0 , %xmm5 movq $ s1z8 _info , -16 ( %rbp ) addq $ - 16 , %rbp jmp Main_zdwfib1 _info $ time ./A 0.3333 ./A 0.33s user 0.00s system 99 % cpu 0.339 total
Using my baseline - O2 - funbox - strict - fields - fvia - C - optc - O3 - optc - march=core2 options , we get , very interestingly ,
Main_zdwfib1_info : leaq - 16 ( %rbp ) , %rax movq %rbp , %rdx cmpq %r14 , %rax jb .L54 ucomisd .LC1 ( %rip ) , %xmm5 jb .L58 .L55 : movsd %xmm5 , - 8 ( %rdx ) movq $ s1z8 _info , - 16 ( %rbp ) subsd .LC2 ( %rip ) , %xmm5 subq $ 16 , %rbp jmp Main_zdwfib1 _info $ time ./A 0.4366 ./A 0.44s user 0.00s system 98 % cpu 0.441 total
Which is certainly smaller , but also slower !
And for the version suggested by Acovea , using just - O2 - fecess - precision ( - fasm ) :
Main_zdwfib1_info : .Lc1 Iv : leaq - 16 ( %rbp ) , %rax cmpq %r14 , %rax jb .
Lc1
Ix ucomisd . Ln1IC ( %rip ) , %xmm5 jae .Lc1
Iz movsd . Ln1ID ( %rip ) , %xmm5 jmp *( %rbp ) .
Lc1 Ix : movl $ Main_zdwfib1_closure , %ebx jmp *-8(%r13 ) .Lc1
Iz : movsd % xmm5 , %xmm0 subsd . Ln1IE ( %rip ) , %xmm0 movsd % xmm5 , - 8 ( %rbp ) movsd % xmm0 , %xmm5 movq $ s1z8 _info ,-16 ( %rbp ) addq $ - 16 , %rbp jmp Main_zdwfib1_info
Which looks identical to - fasm and runs in the same time .
So - fexcess - precision is noise here .
Acovea declares - fasm beat the C backend here .
That ’s interesting : we ’d already assumed - fvia - C was best for this benchmark , but that looks to be wrong .
Progress !
We ’ll now look at a full scale example : finding the best inlining strategy for some already highly optimised code .
Evolving the inliner
As we talked about before , the GHC inliner is a complex thing , but one with lots of optimization potential .
By default , GHC tries to inline things using some magic SimonPJ heuristics , described in http://darcs.haskell.org/ghc/compiler/simplCore/Simplify.lhs.
Since it ’s often useful to override the inliner ’s default strategy , GHC allows us to place INLINE and NOINLINE pragmas on functions , like so :
key_function :: Int -> String -> ( Bool , Double ) {-# INLINE key_function #-}
Note you can also disable inlining on a function , or add a phase annotation to say in which optimization phase of the compiler the inlining should be fired .
Looking at these is further work .
In high performance code , inlining can enable all sorts of interesting new optimizations to fire , and in some cases can turn GHC into a sort of whole program optimizer , by inlining entire libraries into the user code , and then specializing them precisely for that particular use .
Fusion - enabled libraries like uvector work like this .
The problem in general code though is knowing when an INLINE is going to help .
And for this we want to get computer support .
The main trick to have acovea program our INLINE pragmas is to make sure we can turn them on and off via compiler flags .
To do this , we ’ll use CPP .
That is , each potential INLINE point will be lifted into a CPP symbol , that acovea can then switch from its specification file .
In the source we ’ll identify each inlining site with a new CPP symbol :
key_function :: Int -> String -> ( Bool , Double ) INLINE_1
and then build a custom acovea xml file for the inline points in our program .
By default , our command will disable all inlining points :
< prime command = " ghc " flags= " - cpp - v0 - optP - w -- make - fforce - recomp - O2 - DINLINE_1= ACOVEA_OPTIONS
-o ACOVEA_OUTPUT ACOVEA_INPUT
" />
GHC will now call cpp first , with a bunch of acovea - determined INLINE points redefined via a flag :
< flag type =" simple " value= " - DINLINE_1={-# INLINE key_function # - } " />
So now acovea can run our program , flicking switches to turn on and off inlining at each point we suggested it look at .
It ’ll then measure the result and try to find the best combination .
Results
Initially I tried this approach on two programs the Computer Language Benchmarks Game .
The results are now available on the shootout itself at the time of writing .
The faster programs ( after inline optimization ) are first .
Note the k - nucleotide is a multicore parallel program .
First , n- body ,
For k-nucleotide :
In both cases the result found by the GA was an improvement over the hand optimized ( and inlined ) version .
In the case of k - nucleotide , it was 18 % faster over the hand optimized version .
For nbody , it was a marginal improvement ( one better inlining site was found ) .
The specifications to acovea I used and both input programs are here :
For nbody , acovea decided that :
Optimistic options : - DINLINE_23={-# INLINE vel1 #-} ( 2.973 ) Pessimistic options : - DINLINE_24={-# INLINE advance #-} ( - 3.238 )
That is , there ’s a free win if we inline vel1 ( which was a let - bound variable used in two places ) .
Instead of saving the result and reusing the value , we actually get marginally faster code if we just duplicate that small computation .
A relative graph of fitnesses :
Acovea 's Best - of - the - Best : ************************************************* ( 3.4864 ) Acovea 's Common Options : ************************************************* ( 3.4631 ) - optc - O3 : ************************************************** ( 3.5031 )
The improvement is marginal , but that one inlining site ( vel1 ) is enough to make a consistent small difference .
At first , acovea appeared to have found a dramatic improvement ( from 3.4s to 2.1s ) .
It quickly decided that it was a good idea to inline this :
cursor :: IORef ( Ptr Double ) cursor = unsafePerformIO $ newIORef planets
Which sure makes the program faster , but means that ‘ planets ’ is no longer a global mutable array .
The GA stumbled into the unsafePerformIO / INLINING trap !
For k-nucleotide , a more complex program , the results were more interesting , and more impressive .
It suggested that :
Optimistic options : - DINLINE_1={-# INLINE htPayload #-} ( 1.801 ) - DINLINE_2={-# INLINE allocEntry #-} ( 1.556 ) - DINLINE_6={-# INLINE entryMatches #-} ( 1.801 ) - DINLINE_9={-# INLINE calcHash #-} ( 1.801 ) Pessimistic options : - DINLINE_23={-# INLINE hashGenome #-} ( - 2.106 )
Which is interesting , since htPayload was not identified as a good inlining site in the original program ( by hand ) , and has Genome was !
The hand optimized version was going awry .
The final suggestions were :
-DINLINE_1={-# INLINE htPayload #-} -DINLINE_2={-# INLINE allocEntry #-} -DINLINE_6={-# INLINE entryMatches #-} -DINLINE_8={-# INLINE totalEntriesOf #-} -DINLINE_9={-# INLINE calcHash #-} -DINLINE_13={-# INLINE wordSize #-} -DINLINE_14={-# INLINE ht Traverse #-} -DINLINE_20={-# INLINE htInc #-}
only , corresponding to an improvement over the defaults of :
Acovea 's Best - of - the - Best : ******************************************* ( 2.8265 ) Acovea 's Common Options : **************************************** ( 2.6832 ) - optc -O3 : ************************************************** ( 3.2831 )
Interestingly , the best - of - the - best was measured at the end as worse than the common options .
Applying these inlining hints , and the result is now on the shootout as GHC # 4 .
And that ’s it , we ’re using a GA to evolve the inliner !
What next ?
If we ’re going to program the inliner , it can be beneficial to make transformations on functions that allow more inlining .
In particular , manual worker / wrapper .
There ’s been some work already on using a genetic algorithm to evolve optimal strictness hints for GHC using a similar approach ( hints that can be turned on and off ) .
This should also be doable via acovea , using CPP once again to flick the switch .
Next steps are also to automate the construction of acovea specifications and running of timed Haskell programs , using a tool to emit the inlining , flag and runtime specs for a program .
I also do n’t know if using something like simulated annealing would give better results , or results sooner .
There are a number of GHC runtime flags that are interesting to mess with ( heap size , number of generations , scheduling ticks , and for multicore programs , the number of cores to use , and how to tweak the parallel garbage collector .
These are all runtime flags , and acovea only really lets us set things as ‘ compile time ’ flags – we ’d have to bake them into the executable ( doable with a C inclusion ) .
Finally , Tim Harris and Satnam Singh outlined an approach to discovering good `par` points to add paralleliism to Haskell programs , in Feedback Directed Implicit Parallelism ( .pdf ) .
They annotated the runtime to write logs of the actual costs of subexpressions in a profiling phase , and then used that information to place `par` hints on expressions in the source code .
It seems to me that we could use the GA approach to breed `par` hints as well , discovering implicit parallelism in existing programs .
Coincidentally , after writing this article , I found that Tyson Whitehead had suggested the GA approach to improving inlining on the GHC mailing list only a couple of weeks ago .
Also , there ’s been some prior research on genetic algorithms for finding compiler heuristic values , and inliners in particular .
See , for example , papers by John Cavasos
( e.g. “ Automatic Tuning of Inlining Heuristics ” , John Cavazos and Michael F. P. O’Boyle . ) .
I ’m sure there ’s other work .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Most Americans like their health care coverage but are not happy with the overall cost of health care , a national poll shows .
President Obama has said that lowering health care costs will benefit the economy .
More than eight in 10 Americans questioned in a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey released Thursday said they 're satisfied with the quality of health care they receive .
And nearly three out of four said they 're happy with their overall health care coverage .
But satisfaction drops to 52 percent when it comes to the amount people pay for their health care , and more than three out of four are dissatisfied with the total cost of health care in the United States .
" When Americans say they support health care reform , that does n't mean they want to lose their own coverage or give up their own doctor , " said Keating Holland , CNN 's polling director .
" That 's something that the Clinton White House did n't realize in 1993 . "
Half of all Americans questioned in the poll said they are very confident that no one in their household will lose health insurance .
However , 29 percent said they are very confident that they could meet their bills if someone in the household had a major medical emergency .
" It suggests a prescription for health care reform that Americans can swallow -- start by addressing health care costs while allowing Americans to keep their current coverage and their current health care providers , " Holland added .

Obama is making an overhaul of health care a major priority of his administration and wants to create a $ 364 billion fund to pay for it .
The president argues that lowering health care costs will benefit the economy .
The CNN / Opinion Research poll was conducted March 12 through Sunday , with 1,019 adult Americans questioned by telephone .
The survey 's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points .

It 's been suggested that our history of Taste Tests skews a tad bacon-centric here at The A.V. Club .
But here 's the thing :
Y'all are the ones who keep telling us to eat / drink this stuff , even going so far as to send the product directly to us .
You 're the enablers ; we 're just bobbing along on the zeitgeist here .
That said , today 's entry into the canon of baconized comestibles took a little doing on our — well , my — part .

As far as we can tell , no one ( shockingly ) has mass - produced and marketed a bacon - flavored vodka .
But several of you alerted us to this random food - blog entry detailing how to make the stuff , and since then , we 've heard tell of it showing up at the odd bar or restaurant as part of a fancy - schmancy cocktail , usually of the Bloody Mary variety .
Apparently , my wildly successful take on Nutriloaf qualified me to prepare this delicacy to delight / poison my coworkers , so off I went to purchase a package of bacon and a bottle of mid-shelf vodka .
There is n't much to making bacon vodka :
You throw a few cooked slices into the bottle , put it in a cupboard , and wait three weeks .
Advertisement
The toughest part was separating the infused vodka from the globules of fat that congealed and floated to the top .
I tried a couple of passes through cheesecloth , but was still left with visible white chunks .
Since bacon vodka is a hard enough sell already without fatty backwash floating in it , I gave it a couple more passes through a pair of ( new ) nylons , and that seemed to do the trick , leaving me with a mostly clear liquid the pale yellow color of healthy , bacon - scented urine .

So what sort of mixers does bacon - infused booze pair with ?
Well , not much that we could think of , actually .
Tomato juice or Bloody Mary mix seems like the most obvious candidate , so we got a bottle of V8 for making " BLTinis . "
( Trademark pending . )
Beyond that , we were a little stymied , so we went for a basic option , tonic , and a so - weird - it - might - work option , orange - pineapple juice .
( Like a Hawaiian pizza , get it ?
Do n't worry , no one else did either . )

Taste :
With one exception , the reaction to straight bacon vodka was surprisingly neutral .
Most tasters agreed that it was nowhere near as horrible as we expected , though Tasha spit it out and ran away in horror .
[ Hey , I walked briskly in disgust .
— ed. ]
It 's basically salty vodka , with a slightly smoky quality that 's not entirely unpleasant if you 're a fan of savory drinks .
( It should be noted that we drank this at room temperature , as we were n't sure if refrigerating the stuff would cause the remaining atoms of fat to re-congeal .
Perhaps we 're missing out on the glories of ice - cold bacon vodka . )
The BLTini ( one part V8 , one part vodka , with a Bacon Salt rim ) was a definite hit among those who tried it , though many opted out due to an aversion to tomato juice .
Once again , for fans of savory drinks only .
One brave / reckless tester added some to her Diet Coke in spite of general revulsion at the suggestion , to underwhelming ends .
The citrus - bacon combo was surprisingly non-offensive :
Were it served cold , maybe with some Triple Sec or other complementary liqueur , it could probably be a serviceable , if not wildly popular , specialty martini at some fancy fusion joint .
The bacon - vodka tonic tasted , well , like a vodka tonic , with a pretty unpleasant aftertaste .
There 's really no need to dirty up such a clean - tasting cocktail with the brackish essence of salty meat .
Then again , there 's really no need to muddy up such a clean - tasting liquor either , outside of novelty appeal — which it certainly has :
This was our most well - attended Taste Test ever .

April 21 , 2009
It really comes as no surprise Rep. Jane Harman was caught on a federal wiretap offering to lobby the Justice Department to reduce espionage - related charges against AIPAC officials .
Much of Congress is beholden to the Israeli pressure group .
Instead of taking note of this common practice — politicians coming to the rescue of their favored constituents at the expensive of those they were elected to represent — we should take note of the willingness of the NSA and FBI to make this information public .
Somebody wanted Jane Harman out of the picture .
Rep. Jane Harman .
The case is yet another example of how politics works in the District of Criminals .
In exchange for help in getting espionage - related charges reduced against two AIPAC officials , a suspected Israeli agent pledged to lobby Nancy Pelosi , then - House minority leader , to appoint Harman chair of the Intelligence Committee after the 2006 elections , according to CQ Politics .
More specifically , the Los Angeles Times reveals , the caller told Harman Haim Saban would threaten to withhold campaign contributions from Pelosi unless Harman became committee chairwoman .
In October , 2006 , AIPAC denied the allegations .
“ AIPAC would never engage in a quid pro quo in relation to a federal investigation or any federal matter and the notion that it would do so is preposterous , ” AIPAC spokesman Patrick Dorton told Time Magazine at the time .
CQ ’s Jeff Stein says then Attorney General Alberto Gonzales intervened on Harman ’s behalf because he needed her help selling the Bush administration ’s illegal warrantless wiretap program .
Harman “ helped persuade [ The New York Times ] to hold the wiretap story before , on the eve of the 2004 elections .
And although it was too late to stop the Times from publishing now , she could be counted on again to help defend the program , ” according to Stein .
[ efoods ]
Haim Saban , an Israeli - American media mogul , has been described by the New York Times as a “ tireless cheerleader for Israel . ”
Former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon described Saban as “ a dear personal friend .
Haim Saban is a great American citizen and a man who always stood by Israel and the Jewish people in times of need .
His contribution to strengthening ties between Israel and American political leaders from all parties has been quite remarkable and outstanding . ”
Earlier this year , it was reported that Israeli spokeswoman Tzipora Menache allegedly said she was not worried about negative ramifications related to the Israeli onslaught on Gaza .
“ You know very well , and the stupid Americans know equally well , that we control their government , irrespective of who sits in the White House , ” she reportedly said .
“ You see , I know it and you know it that no American president can be in a position to challenge us even if we do the unthinkable .
What can they ( Americans ) do to us ?
We control congress , we control the media , we control show biz , and we control everything in America .
In America you can criticize God , but you ca n’t criticize Israel . ”
In 2001 , then foreign Minister Shimon Peres reportedly told Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon during a cabinet meeting : “ I want to tell you something very clear , do n’t worry about American pressure on Israel , we , the Jewish people control America , and the Americans know it . ” ” The exchange was reported by Kol Yisrael radio .
“ I ’m a one - issue guy and my issue is Israel , ” Saban told Forbes in 2003 .
Harman ’s office told the Associated Press she “ never contacted the Justice Department about its prosecution of present or former AIPAC employees , and the Justice Department never informed her that she was or is the subject of or involved in an investigation . ”
In a statement , Harman attempted to change the subject .
“ If there is anything about this story that should arouse concern it is that the Bush administration may have been engaged in electronic surveillance of members of the congressional intelligence committees . ”
Harman did n’t bother to mention the fact she had leaned on the New York Times in order to get the newspaper to hold off on publishing an article on the unconstitutional NSA wiretap program .
“ Harman is a poster child for what has been wrong with Congress for the last 8 years , ” writes George Washington ’s Blog .
She needs to be brought up on ethics and bribery charges immediately and drummed out of Congress .
If the AIPAC operatives are convicted , treason charges against Harman should not be ruled out .

Americans need to know where Harman 's loyalties lie
[ C]ontrary to reports that the Harman investigation was dropped for " lack of evidence , " it was Alberto R. Gonzales , President Bush 's top counsel and then attorney general , who intervened to stop the Harman probe .
Why ?
Because , according to three top former national security officials , Gonzales wanted Harman to be able to help defend the administration 's warrantless wiretapping program , which was about break in The New York Times and engulf the White House .
As for there being " no evidence " to support the FBI probe , a source with firsthand knowledge of the wiretaps called that " bullshit . "
" I read those transcripts , " said the source , who like other former national security officials familiar with the transcript discussed it only on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of domestic NSA eavesdropping .
Do n't be surprised .
There are many reasons we 've been opposing slimy Blue Dog Jane Harman since 2006 .
Jeff Stein at broke the story early this morning .
If you have n't spent your day watching a gaggle of Fox propaganda agents talking about Obama 's handshakes and fascism , you 've probably heard about it .
Harman " was overheard on an NSA wiretap telling a suspected Israeli agent that she would lobby the Justice Department reduce espionage - related charges against two officials of the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee , the most powerful pro-Israel organization in Washington . "
The Bush Regime agreed to cover - up the result of their eavesdropping in return for Harman 's steadfast support of ... illegal eavesdropping and other unconstitutional Bush Regime policies .
Now the hackish Harman professes to be shocked thatwould be wiretapped .
I guess she was n't paying attention to what she was helping Bush perpetrate on the American people .
Why has n't she resigned yet ?
TPM has put together a very detailed and revealing timeline of everything that happened in this scandal that could send Rep. Harman to prison .
And the video of Stein onthis evening certainly makes it all crystal clear :
And now we see why Pelosi refused to let Harman become chair of the House Intelligence Committee .
Harman should retire from politics .
I hope Marcy Winograd has kept in touch with her supporters .

Destiny sez , " In a new interview , Vernor Vinge predicts the Singularity within 21 years .
' I 'd personally be surprised if it had n't happened by 2030 , ' he announces , saying humankind may become ' the only animal that has figured out how to outsource its cognition ' to superintelligent machines .
Since 1981
Vinge has been popularizing the idea of a massive technological shift which replaces ' the human era ' with an advanced humanity augmented by artificial intelligence .
' It is very unsettling to realize that we may be entering an era where questions like ' What is the meaning of life ? ' will be practical engineering questions , ' 64 - year - old Vinge agrees .
' On the other hand , I think it could be kind of healthy , if we look at the things we really want — and look at what it would mean if we could get them . ' "
I 'm on record as being a skeptic about this stuff , but man , Vernor 's fun to read .

Adults with a BMI of 28 or more will be able to get orlistat A pill said to help dieters lose extra pounds is to go on sale over the counter in the UK for the first time .
Orlistat - brand name Alli - has been licensed for prescription in the UK for more than 10 years .
Overweight people will be able to get the drug from chemists for £ 50 for a month 's supply from Wednesday .
The pill , which works by blocking the absorption of fat in the body , is aimed at adults with a Body Mass Index ( BMI ) of 28 or more .
Manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline says its clinical trials show adding orlistat to a reduced - calorie , lower - fat diet , can help people lose 50 % more weight than dieting alone .
Nasty side - effects
But if they persist in eating fat , they will experience some nasty side - effects such as diarrhoea and gas problems .

The Royal College of GPs has advised that the side - effects of the drug are very unpleasant in many people and that it should only be used with support and dietary advice .
The organisation said everyone who wanted the pill should go to their GP for advice because some of them would have treatable causes for their obesity , and all of them would have risk factors for other illnesses which would need to be discussed .
Dr Matt Capehorn , from the National Obesity Forum , warned the drug was not a magic bullet , had a proven track record of being effective and safe .
ONE MAN'S EXPERIENCE Mike Hare lost 15 stone ( 95 kg ) in two - and - a - half years using Orlistat .
He says it was a good kick start - but was far from perfect .
He said : " I hated the side effects .
They really were acutely embarrassing at times and very restricting . "
He said : " It is a credit to the company that they have resisted the temptation to make it available like your toothpaste or paracetamol - where you can go in , buy it , take it to the till and walk out .
" It is still only going to be available as part of a structured weight management programme . "
David Pruce , director of policy and communication at the Royal Pharmaceutical Society , welcomed the drug .
He said : " A lot of pharmacists are already helping people with weight management , and what this does is it gives us another weapon in the armoury to help people in the fight against obesity . "
Orlistat has been available over - the - counter in the US for two years .
Caution urged However , Dr Donald Hensrud , an expert in nutrition at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota , warned that the impressive results achieved by the drug in tightly - controlled clinical trials would not necessarily be replicated in the real world .
He said people who took the drug for a couple of months , but then stopped would probably find that any weight they lost would be put back on .
And he stressed the pill could not work without accompanying lifestyle changes .
Dr Hensrud said : " In general weight loss is difficult and people are always looking for the easy answer .
" If they think this pill is going to do it for them , and is going to be the answer to their problems , and they can indulge a little bit more I think they will be quite disappointed . "

news Hold It Now And Watch the Hoodwink
There ’s something a little funny about the full page ad in this week ’s Eye for Joshua Jackson ’s new cross-Canada motorcycle movie One Week .
Rather than the words of wizened critics , the ad features a page full of quotations from people who seem to have not actually seen the movie .
“ I am definitely going to watch this ! ” says one ; “ It ’s going to look amazing on the big screen ! ” says another ; “ I agree this looks like a great film ” writes a third .
“ All of Canada is talking about ONE WEEK * ” the ad ’s copy exclaims , and —hey , wait , what ’s that asterisk for ?
Oh yeah : every single bright - red quotation on the page , lauding the film and its actors , is one of the ninety - three YouTube comments on the film ’s trailer .
… aaannndd every comment we could find is attributed to the wrong YouTube user .
There you have it .
Go see One Week !
It ’s the film whose trailer no more than 1 in every 360,000 Canadians have left a YouTube comment about .

The spectacularly stupid and offensive Fox News show Red Eye with host Greg Gutfeld ( above ) sunk to new depths this week by belittling a neighbor and ally in the so - called war on terrorism .
Although Canada opted out of involvement in Iraq , they have been in Afghanistan since 2002 .
Originally slated to leave in 2009 , the Canadian government has extended the Afghan mission to 2011 .
At least one of the guests claimed he did n't know Canadian forces were in Afghanistan , which is typical of the expertise on the show .
Certainly , conservative radio host Monica Crowley was n't out of place .
An ill - considered and ill - timed bit of idiocy it was too , as yesterday four Canadian soldiers were killed and eight wounded near Kandahar .
Master Cpl. Scott Francis Vernelli ( 28 ) , Cpl. Tyler Crooks ( 24 ) , Trooper Jack Bouthillier ( 20 ) and Trooper Corey Joseph Hayes ( 22 ) were killed Friday in two roadside bomb blasts in Kandahar province .
Eight Canadian soldiers were also wounded .

New York Comic Con 2009 : Toys and Collectables Gallery Subscribe Posted by Michael Pinto on Feb 8 , 2009 in Hobbies and Collections The ATMs at the Javits Center charge a whopping $ 3 fee — however this may not be a bad thing as the New York Comic Con could empty your wallet rather quickly .
The showroom floor is so packed with goodies it ’s as if the Mall of America were run by fanboys — every inch is crammed with everything from arty urban toys to rare collectables .

WASHINGTON -- Factory jobs disappeared .
Inflation soared .
Unemployment climbed to alarming levels .
The hungry lined up at soup kitchens .
It was n't the Great Depression .
It was the 1981 - 82 recession , widely considered America 's worst since the depression .
More national news : Cleveland.com/nation
More news coverage about employment
That painful time during Ronald Reagan 's presidency is a grim marker of how bad things can get .
Yet the current recession could slice deeper into the U.S. economy .
If it lasts into April -- as it almost surely will -- this one will go on record as the longest in the postwar era .
The 1981 - 82 and 1973 - 75 recessions each lasted 16 months .
Unemployment has n't reached 1982 levels and the gross domestic product has n't fallen quite as far .
But the hurt from this recession is spread more widely and uncertainty about the country 's economic health is worse today than it was in 1982 .
Back then , if someone asked if the nation was about to experience something as bad as the Great Depression , the answer was , " Quite clearly , ' No , ' " said Murray Weidenbaum , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Reagan White House .
" You do n't have that certainty today , " he said .
" It 's not only that the downturn is sharp and widespread , but a lot of people worry that it 's going to be a long - lasting , substantial downturn . "
For months , headlines have compared this recession with the one that began in July 1981 and ended in November 1982 .
• In January , reports showed 207,000 manufacturing jobs vanished in the largest one - month drop since October 1982 .
• Major automakers ' U.S. sales extended their deep slump in February , putting the industry on track for its worst sales month in more than 27 years .
• Struggling homebuilders have just completed the worst year for new home sales since 1982 .
• There are 12.5 million people out of work today , topping the number of jobless in 1982 .
" I think most people think it is worse than 1982 , " said John Steele Gordon , a financial historian .
" I do n't think many people think it will be 1932 again .
Let us pray .
But it 's probably going to be the worst postwar recession , certainly . "
The 1982 downturn was driven primarily by the desire to rid the economy of inflation .
To battle a decade - long bout of high inflation , then - Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker , now an economic adviser to President Barack Obama , pushed interest rates up to levels not seen since the Civil War .
The approach tamed inflation , but not without suffering .
Hardest hit was the industrial Midwest ; the Pacific Northwest , where the logging industry lagged from construction declines ; and some states in the South , where the recession hit late .
Frustrated workers fled to the Sunbelt to find work .
In Michigan , which led the nation in jobless workers , newspapers offered idled auto workers free " job wanted " ads in the classified section .
Mortgages carried double - digit interest rates .
When the 1982 recession ended , the national jobless rate had hit 10.8 percent .
Just like today , that recession led to political finger - pointing .
When the government reported a 10.1 percent jobless rate for September 1982 , organized labor rallied across the street from the White House .
A few protesters chained themselves to an entrance at the Labor Department .
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce called it a national tragedy and blamed Democrats .
Democrats called it a national tragedy and blamed Reagan .
Even months after the recession officially ended , Reagan was greeted in Pittsburgh by signs that said : " We want jobs , Mr. Hoover " and " Reagan says his economic program is working -- are you ? "
President Herbert Hoover 's term is forever linked in history with the Great Depression .
Those not as badly hurt have fuzzy memories of the 1981 - 82 recession .
Not Jim O'Connor of Pekin , Ill. , who was president of United Auto Workers Local 974 when Caterpillar Tractor Co. was laying off workers in Peoria in the 1980s .
Maybe time has soothed the sting O'Connor felt , but he contends the economic problems facing workers today are worse than during the recession he survived nearly three decades ago .
" The days of walking out of one factory and walking into another one down the street are over , " O'Connor said .
He retired from Caterpillar in 2001 but thinks he might find part - time job to help pay his health insurance .
" When I hired in at Caterpillar in 1968 , we had numerous factories here .
Almost all of that has left the country or moved South .
The unions do n't have any leverage anymore at the bargaining table .
So these young people ( today ) are n't only out of work , you know .
They were n't making a living wage when they lost their job , " he said .
Like Reagan did then , Obama is dishing up hope .
Trouble is , people can't visualize any reward they might get from making it through this recession , said William Niskanen , an economic adviser to Reagan .
There 's little hope of any gain from the pain .
Falling housing and stock prices have undermined household wealth .
People are worried about losing their jobs , their homes and their retirement savings all at a time when health care is weighing down income .
" In the 1980s , it was clear to people that the inflation rate was going to come way down and it did , " Niskanen said .
" There was a sense that we were going through a tough time for a while as a price of getting inflation down and that things would come back up .
Today , they can't see any gain from what 's going on . "
Consumer confidence is in free fall .
Banks are in peril .
The overall economy , as measured by the GDP , shrank at a 6.2 percent annual rate in final three months of last year , the worst drop since the first quarter of 1982 .
The unemployment rate , at 8.1 percent in February , has n't reached the 10.8 percent reported in November 1982 , but the recession is not over .
It 's not only blue - collar workers who are feeling the greatest anguish .
Americans who are trapped in houses worth less than their mortgages are suffering .
So , too , are people whose personal wealth is tied to the stock market .
Personal wealth is dwindling in the U.S. , and the effects of the financial meltdown have been felt around the world .
" This recession is broader , deeper and more complicated than virtually anything we have ever seen , " Wachovia Corp. economist Mark Vitner said .
" The whole evolution of the credit markets resulted in all sorts of complex financial instruments that are difficult to unwind .
It 's like trying to unscramble scrambled eggs .
It just can't be done that easily .
I do n't know if it can be done at all . "
He said he sees fear in the eyes of his clients .
" I 've had people come up and hug me after a presentation , which is unusual , " he said .
" I have n't told them anything about how it 's going to be better , but they just feel better having a better understanding of what 's happening . "
One of the most popular online videos last week was a very funny interview Conan O’Brien did the comedian Louis CK .
Louis makes the observation that although we have so many amazing things these days ( eg high speed internet access on airplanes ) , people still do n’t seem to be happy .
If you have n’t seen it already , I recommend you watch Everything ’s Amazing , Nobody ’s Happy ( sorry , YouTube wo n’t let me embed the video into this post ) .
This video reminded me that it is very easy to take many wonderful things in our lives for granted .
If we can only learn to look at life a little differently , it is possible to find an abundance of things to be thankful for .

Though the RIAA says it has stopped its large - scale litigation strategy against suspected file - swappers , the music trade group has decided that it will continue those cases that were already in process before last winter .
When put this way , the whole process sounds antiseptic and rather boring , but it continues to affect real people like middle - aged New Hampshire woman Mavis Roy , who was baffled when the music labels accused her of sharing songs like " Real Niggaz , " " Jigga My Nigga , " and " Da Rockwilder " using BearShare .
Unable to afford a lawyer , Roy was confused by the legal documents she received .
" I thought it was a scam and I was being pressured to send them money for something I have never done , " she eventually wrote the court in a letter .
A long and winding road
The case was brought early in 2008 .
Roy was served with papers ; she never responded .
Within a few months , she was in default in a federal court case , and all that remained was for the judge to agree with the labels on how much money Roy would pay .
Fortunately for Roy , at this point she replied .
She personally wrote the court a letter , explaining that she had not understood the notices , thought they were some kind of scam , and could not afford a lawyer to look into them .
" I have never downloaded nor do I even know where to go to download , " she wrote .
" I feel they should have to show me something that proves this was done by me . "
She did n't know what to do next .
Daniel Lynch , the Chief Deputy Clerk of the court , wrote Roy a letter that explained when the litigation had started , when the damages hearing was to happen , and noted the fact she had personally been served with papers in April 2008 .
Beyond that , Lynch was legally unable to provide any sort of legal advice , though he did include a copy of the " Pro Se Litigant Guide " to help Roy learn more about defending herself .
The labels eventually moved to skip the damages hearing altogether ( since Roy had not yet shown up in court ) and have the judge make a decision without a hearing , but Roy did file an objection of her own in plain language .
In four sentences , she objects to the cancellation , says that she did n't download any music , and " will appear in court .
I know they [ the labels ] do not have proof of anything and that is why they are trying to push it through without a hearing . "
At the bottom of the page , the " certificate of service " showing that a copy of the note was sent to the record labels ' attorney , is handwritten .
Help arrives
But in late summer 2008 , Roy 's luck turned .
She received help from the Franklin Pierce Law Center in Concord , New Hampshire .
A pair of professors agreed to help her , and they deputized their law students to assist .
The case was even profiled in the local paper back in January .
( Sound familiar ?
The Joel Tenenbaum case in Massachusetts is being argued by a Harvard Law professor and his students .
The University of Maine School of Law has also taken up RIAA cases . )
An answer to the complaint was filed .
The damages hearing was canceled , and the case began to move forward .
In a document filed last September , Roy describes every person in her household who might have " discoverable information " relevant to her defense .
From that document , we learn that the home did possess a Dell computer of some kind , but that Roy 's husband did not know how to use it .
Roy herself used it but " did not use it to download or upload any music files . "
Roy does have two children living at home , one 22 and one 19 .
While these might seem like far more likely targets of the lawsuit , Roy claims that neither child used the family computer ( which is apparently quite old ) in the last four years , and that neither has a computer of their own .
Roy 's home computer actually became nonfunctional in the spring of 2007 and was removed from her home by her brother , who took it to his house to fix it .
He found a machine infected with " one or more viruses " and then replaced the hard drive , recycling the original .
That last item is key , since the hard drive in the computer at the time of alleged infringement no longer exists .
Forensic analysis of the drive might therefore not yield much useful information , and could make the case harder to prosecute .
The case is ongoing in federal court .
It highlights a key weakness of the current enforcement proceedings , which can only target the account owner of the Internet connection in question — someone who may be baffled by the legal documents they 're seeing even if the infringement was actually committed in their house by a child or friend .
It also shows how law schools are getting involved in such cases , giving their students a first taste of federal court by having them assist with file - swapping cases .
A couple of law clinics defending a couple of defendants is no big deal , but it was probably wise of the music industry to stop filing new suits when it did ; the last thing that record labels want is a host of bright young lawyers cutting their teeth on federal file - sharing cases in which the RIAA sues poor defendants for massive damages .
The case is scheduled for a two to three day trial later this year .
The Italian town where residents and immigrants travel on separate buses
A segregated bus route for immigrants is being introduced in an Italian town .
The move has been met with accusations of discrimination and revived the debate over the treatment of non-EU citizens in the country .
But Foggia 's mayor said it was for the safety of the migrants , and that they would be free to travel on any service .
The town of Foggia , in Puglia , southern Italy : Local authorities have decided to start a separate bus service for immigrants
The 24 / i bus service will take foreigners directly to an immigrant hostel , bypassing a working - class area served by the existing 24 bus .
Authorities say friction has been rising between residents of the Mezzanone neighbourhood and 800 or so migrants who live in the hostel after a series of robberies blamed on foreigners .
' At the heart of the decision are the clashes between immigrants and residents , ' centre - left mayor Orazio Ciliberti was quoted as saying in La Repubblica newspaper .
' We are not talking about racism , but about providing a better service , ' he added .
The news of the route , which starts on Monday , prompted comparisons with Apartheid - era South Africa and the segregated buses in the southern United States during the 1950s .
Habib Ben Sghaier , of immigrant association Asci , branded the move racist .
' This is not how to achieve integration , ' he said .
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's centre - right coalition has recently introduced a raft of anti-immigrant legislation , which has boosted his popularity .
Joint Special Operations Command comprises Delta Force personnel that have killed U.S. citizens and acted in support of Obama ’s expanded war in Pakistan
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Saturday , March 14 , 2009
Revelations that a political assassination unit which reported solely to Dick Cheney was in operation during the Bush administration are absent the fact that the unit in question , the Joint Special Operations Command , has been active for decades , has been deployed domestically in the U.S. , has killed U.S. citizens , and is an integral part of Barack Obama ’s expanded wars in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Seymour Hersh dropped a bombshell when he told a University of Minnesota audience on Tuesday that the Joint Special Operations Command is , “ An executive assassination ring essentially , and it ’s been going on and on and on , ” Hersh stated .
“ Under President Bush ’s authority , they ’ve been going into countries , not talking to the ambassador or the CIA station chief , and finding people on a list and executing them and leaving .
That ’s been going on , in the name of all of us . ”
Subsequent media coverage of Hersh ’s comments , such as a special feature on last night ’s Countdown with Keith Olbermann , has framed the story in the inaccurate context that the JSOC was a personal hit team acting on behalf of Cheney alone , when in reality the unit was created in 1980 and continues to play a central role in Barack Obama ’s continuation of the so - called war on terror .
As we learn from the Global Security website , the Joint Special Operations Command in fact comprises mostly of Delta Force soldiers and SEALs .
The unit was established in 1980 and is located at Pope Air Force Base , North Carolina and at nearby Fort Bragg .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The assassination unit was not a creation of the Bush administration or Dick Cheney , it has in fact been “ involved in a number of covert military operations over the last two decades , ” including the covert U.S. invasions of Panama and Granada , as well as search and rescue missions in Somalia , and searching for alleged war criminals in Yugoslavia .
Notably , the unit also routinely “ provides support to domestic law enforcement agencies ” during high profile events such as the Olympics , the World Cup , political party conventions ; and Presidential inaugurations , including the 2005 inauguration of George W. Bush , at which a small group of commandoes were “ deployed under a secret counterterrorism program named Power Geyser ” .
It was also reported that Delta Force were involved in the largest ever single act of slaughter of civilians by law enforcement in US history – the 1993 siege on the Branch Davidian compound at Waco .
In 1999 , Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair revealed that Delta Force units based out of Fort Bragg had been enlisted as part of the assault team on the Branch Davidian Compound .
76 people died in the siege , including 21 children and two pregnant women .
Alex Jones has gone up against Delta Force on numerous occasions while reporting on urban warfare training drills around the country .
Delta Force conducted mock raids , dropping bombs in San Antonio , Kingsville , Alice , and Corpus Christie amongst other Texas towns .
In many cases , the local authorities were not even warned before Delta Force invaded , and in one case , they even tried to pay off a police chief in San Antonio before he kicked them out .
Watch clips of Delta Force ’s activities inside America from Alex Jones ’ Police State 2000 documentary below .
According to Global Security , Bill Clinton ’s 1994 Presidential Decision Directive 25 “ exempt (s ) the Joint Special Operations Command from the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 18USC Sec.1385 , PL86-70 , Sec. 17[d ] .
which makes it illegal for military and law enforcement to exercise jointly . ”
The Joint Special Operations Command is a sub-unit of the United States Special Operations Command , which is described at the “ Department of Defense ’s front man in the global war on terrorism ” .
A New York Times article from last year reported that the Joint Special Operations Command were conducting ground raids in Pakistan supposedly aimed at hunting “ Al - Qaeda members ” .
Such raids have only increased since Obama came to power .
Once again , the corporate media has completely fudged the most prescient issue arising out of Hersh ’s revelation , which is the fact that the Joint Special Operations Command ( mainly comprising of Delta Force ) was not merely the brainchild or personal political assassination wing for Dick Cheney , but it has been in operation for decades , including inside the United States , has been involved in the murder of U.S. citizens , and is an integral part of Barack Obama ’s expansion of the so - called war on terror .
By failing to reverse Bill Clinton ’s PDD25 and not abolishing the Joint Special Operations Command , Barack Obama is in violation of Gerald R. Ford ’s Executive Order 11905 , which states , “ No employee of the United States Government shall engage in , or conspire to engage in , political assassination . ”
Dick Cheney is also in violation of this executive order , but with the Obama administration signaling that they will not pursue any members of the Bush administration for war crimes , the Republicans and the Democrats are once again running defense for each other as more illegal acts are committed .

Comment on this article
Contagion theorists argue that the global financial system is inherently fragile , meaning that if several significant institutions fail , the system will implode .
But the evidence points to the opposite conclusion .
The financial system is robust and able to deal with the failures of some of its largest institutions .
The justification put forth by regulators and politicians is that bailout money needs to be spent in order to ward off systemic collapse .
In announcing additional aid to AIG on Monday , the Federal Reserve and the Treasury issued a joint statement pointing to the “ systemic risk AIG continues to pose . ”
Given the large and growing price of keeping systemic risk at bay , it is important to explain exactly what it is .
The concept is straightforward .
A large bank fails , and its counterparties , to whom it owes money , also fail and so on in a domino effect .
Those who support this theory invariably point to vast sums of derivative contracts outstanding .
If there are tens of trillions of dollars of derivatives contracts , it must be the case that the system is vulnerable to the failure of a large player .
Derivatives , those “ financial weapons of mass destruction , ” to quote Warren Buffet , are the transmission mechanism whereby the financial world ends with a bang .
It has become an article of faith that the system will implode if some of the larger players fail , because the derivative claims presented by their counterparties would go unpaid , leaving their counterparties unable to meet their own obligations , and so on .
We need to question this article of faith , and it might help to start with the Lehman bankruptcy .
Lehman ’s failure was a perfect storm .
Lehman was not only the 4th largest U.S. securities firm , it punched above its weight in fixed income , and specifically in credit derivatives .
Lehman was both a huge dealer in Credit Default Swaps ( CDS ) and one of the most common reference names to be traded in individual swaps and CDS indexes .
Worse , the settlement of Lehman CDS was about as bad as could be imagined .
The settlement price determined by dealer auction was a measly 8.625 cents on the dollar .
This means that of the $ 400 billion in Lehman CDS outstanding , Protection Sellers ( those long Lehman ) had to pay $ 365 billion to the Protection Buyers ( those short Lehman ) .
Before the settlement of those swaps last October , concerns surrounding the payments were widespread .
The New York Times ’ Floyd Norris worried that “ we do not know how many such swaps are even outstanding , let alone who is on the hook to pay . ”
But settlement was a non-event .
Given the widespread trading in Lehman CDS , and the near zero recovery rate , it is remarkable that the CDS market was able to function as designed .
More impressive , there does not appear to have been a significant knock - on effect where Lehman ’s own counterparties suffered sizable losses on under - collateralized trades .
While it is fashionable to decry the unregulated nature of CDS , the market did its job fairly well because the collateral system among banks and hedge funds insured that most of the money protection sellers would need to pay protection buyers was already in place .
Then came AIG .
And in order to avoid systemic collapse the government invested $ 150 billion and counting .
Now that AIG ’s stock price has fallen below $ 1 and its market capitalization is about $ 1 billion , it is worth remembering why this investment was made in the first place .
AIG was a special case because banks would trade with it on an uncollateralized basis .
AIG Financial Products was a Protection Seller against mortgage CDOs , meaning it insured the top tranches of these now toxic securities .
Because of its size and credit quality , AIG would often not have to post collateral for this insurance , provided it maintained its AAA rating .
In retrospect , the decision to buy protection from AIG without adequate collateral mechanics was just another foolish credit decision by the banks .
Facing imminent downgrade , and realizing it would not be able to post sufficient collateral to satisfy its contractual obligations , AIG found an equity partner in the U.S. taxpayer .
After this , the story gets murky , but we know a large part of the taxpayer ’s investment went to satisfy the “ margin calls ” of banks and brokers to whom AIG had sold protection .
It is something of a national scandal that we do not know exactly how much and to whom .
What we do know is that last September a number of banks and brokers were able to convince Treasury Secretary Paulson that if AIG failed , the stress to the system would be too great and systemic collapse would follow .
I believe Paulson was gulled , and I think the Lehman bankruptcy bolsters my case .
AIG was unusual in that very few institutions get away with not posting collateral on derivative trades .
The general trade for a bank with a bank or a bank with a hedge fund is two - way margining .
That is , as the price of the underlying contract fluctuates , collateral goes back and forth on a daily basis .
These arrangements are governed by Master ISDA Agreements and while there are variations among them , it is unusual between large institutions for the contract to be one - sided , meaning one side posts margin and the other side does not .
Where Paulson appears to have been hoodwinked was in believing that system - wide collateral arrangements were hugely inadequate .
This myth persists today .
AIG ’s unusual arrangement became a metaphor for the whole system .
But AIG ’s collateral arrangements were the exception , not the rule .
Clearly AIG ’s failure to post collateral upon a ratings downgrade would have severely damaged a number of its immediate counterparties who traded with it on the basis of “ ratings triggers ” rather than actual collateral .
But in order for the contagion theory to be true , it would need to be true that these direct counterparties of AIG had also not posted sufficient collateral to their counterparties .
This is very unlikely .
In the world of derivative trading , Lehman , not AIG , was the norm .
What this mean is that in general , banks have adequate collateral against counterparty claims .
Those who traded derivatives with Lehman seem to have had sufficient collateral to cover the unwinding of their trades following Lehman ’s bankruptcy filing .
The system worked as designed , even while unsecured creditors of Lehman can expect to be virtually wiped out in the final bankruptcy settlement .
Thus the Lehman fact pattern indicates that whatever contagion would have followed an AIG failure would have been limited to AIG ’s largest direct counterparties and not created wave after wave of failure .
Those who convinced the government to save AIG to save the system were really saving themselves .
The hysteria whipped up by those who insist that we must keep moribund institutions alive to prevent financial Armageddon is now bordering on recklessness .
Monday ’s joint Treasury - Fed announcement mentioned AIG ’s “ 30,000,000 policyholders in the US ” and “ retirement insurance for teachers . ”
Surely Bernanke and Geithner know that the insurance subsidiaries of AIG are separately capitalized and insulated , by design , from the problems of AIG Financial Products and the holding company .
What possible reason could there be for frightening policyholders and retired teachers ?
Nobody expects that we can have a series of large bank failures in America without suffering some pain .
But the ensuing dislocation must be weighed against the cost of the bailouts .
As the situation continues to worsen , we need leaders who can explain these tradeoffs with credibility .
At the moment , we have a perverse situation where our leaders seem to have a vested interest in making the system appear weaker than it is .
Only Jack Bauer 's grandfather can save us now .
I like to torment Canadians , who are wildly supercilious about Americans ' ignorance of their northern neighbor .
Canada even had a hilarious TV feature , " Talking to Americans , " mocking how little we knew about them .
When I meet a Canadian , I ask : Who is Kiefer Sutherland 's most famous relative ?
Inevitably , they say his father , actor Donald Sutherland .
To turn the screw , I add : No , this relative was voted the Greatest Canadian , ever , in a 2004 Canadian Broadcasting Corp. poll .
Three out of four have no idea whom I am talking about .
Kiefer knows .
When asked about the burden of being Donald Sutherland 's son , he answers , no , the burden is living up to the legacy of Tommy Douglas , his maternal grandfather .
He is a man who changed the world .
Who was Tommy Douglas ?
He was the social democratic premier of Saskatchewan , an ordained minister partly educated in the social gospel , and partly educated at the University of Chicago , who avoided losing his leg as a young man because a doctor agreed to treat him for free .
Douglas pushed through what the Canadians called Medicare - universal , free health insurance - in Saskatchewan , which was later adopted by the national government in 1966 .
You think it was easy ?
Check the clips .
The doctors in Saskatchewan went on strike for 23 days , refusing to treat patients .
Their arguments were the ones we have been hearing here for decades :
Most people already have health insurance , the government has no business regulating the private marketplace , and so on .
The doctors lost , and the rest is history .
Canada has free medical care .
It 's not a perfect system - show me one that is - but it must look attractive to the tens of millions of Americans who have no health coverage at all .
Is there a Tommy Douglas for America ?
President Obama was grooming former Senator Tom Daschle for the role , but that came a cropper .
Harvard Business
School health policy expert Regina Herzlinger doubts Daschle was up to the job , anyway : " He was defeated for reelection , and he never got any major legislation through . "
She 's does n't think his two stand-ins at Health and Human Services and inside the White House are world beaters , either : " They are not going to go down in history the way Tommy Douglas did . "
" Ted Kennedy might have been able to champion some serious health care reform , " Herzlinger adds .
" Maybe the Senate will enact all or part of Obama 's legislation as a tribute to him . "
Is there an appetite for Canadian - style health coverage in the United States ?
I was told no .
" That 's a simplistic question , " says James Burgess of Boston University 's School of Public Health , " but the simple answer is no .
In Canada they have a certain number of doctors working off a global budget .
Here we have more doctors and more highly paid specialists .
To control costs , we 're going to have to take away somebody 's income , and that will be hard .
" Politically , it 's still the case that most people are happy with their coverage in the US , " Burgess says .
" A small number of people are really harmed by the system , but it 's hard to build a populist movement around them . "
Even Jon Kingsdale , executive director of our state 's modestly socialized Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority , thinks it is " very , very , very , very unlikely " that Canadian - style coverage will come to the United States .
" It 's very popular in Canada , it 's cheaper , and it 's simple to administer , " he says of Canadian Medicare .
But " it would be less well received here , " Kingsdale thinks .
" In other countries , people trust the government to make their lives better , but you do n't get that feeling here .
The premise is that the government can't be trusted to run the health care system . "

Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - MN ) has introduced legislation that would “ bar the dollar from being replace by any foreign currency . ”
A statement from Bachmann ’s website :
“ Yesterday , during a Financial Services Committee hearing , I asked Secretary Geithner if he would denounce efforts to move towards a global currency and he answered unequivocally that he would , ” said Bachmann .
“ And President Obama gave the nation the same assurances .
But just a day later , Secretary Geithner has left the option on the table .
I want to know which it is .
The American people deserve to know . ”
On Monday , Geithner and Bernanke both rejected the idea of a global currency in Congressional testimony .
But in remarks to the Council on Foreign Relations yesterday , Geithner indicated he was open to the idea .

All good news .
Another thing I 've realized ?
After the last few months of $ 792 billion bailouts and an additional trillion dollars of various other cash infusions , and an additional trillion dollars going to AIG 's janitorial staff , $ 2.4 billion just does n't sound like a significant amount of money anymore .

Robert E. Rubin , arguably the best - known financier of his generation and the recently retired Treasury Secretary , has taken a top position at Citigroup , the nation 's largest financial services company .
Mr. Rubin , 61 , a former top official of Goldman , Sachs & Company , said yesterday that he had joined Sanford I. Weill and John S. Reed , the chairmen and chief executives Citigroup , in what Mr. Reed described as a '' three - person office of the chairman ' ' that will oversee what has become the first true American financial conglomerate since the Depression .
The appointment came less than a week after the Clinton Administration and Congress agreed on a compromise bill that would overhaul the laws that regulate the financial industry , a measure that removes many of the restrictions preventing banks , securities firms and insurance companies from buying one another or engaging in one another 's businesses .
Both Mr. Rubin and Citigroup strongly supported the bill , which would greatly benefit the company .
Mr. Rubin said he played a role in arranging the final compromise that will probably lead to the repeal of the so - called Glass - Steagall legislation .
But he said that had nothing to do with his decision to join the company .
The appointment settles the speculation about what Mr. Rubin , who presided over the Clinton Administration 's economic policy during one of America 's longest economic booms , would do for an encore .
Mr. Rubin also discussed jobs with American International Group , a leading life insurance company , and Warburg Pincus , a New York investment firm , before agreeing to join Citigroup , said people who were told about Mr. Rubin 's negotiations .
He also had discussions with Goldman , Sachs about serving on his old firm 's board , people close to Mr. Rubin said .

Mr Freeman accused pro-Israel groups of waging a campaign against him The undoing of Charles Freeman , who had been nominated as the next chairman of the US National Intelligence Council , is continuing to draw a barrage of reactions from a surprisingly diverse range of corners .
Chinese dissidents , former American ambassadors and intelligence officials have all weighed in , as the debate continues over whether Mr Freeman was brought down by his views on Israel .
An outspoken former ambassador to Riyadh , Mr Freeman found himself at the centre of a growing controversy about his views on Israel , China and Tibet while the campaign against him , first online and then on Capitol Hill kept growing .
On Tuesday , 10 March , his soon - to - be boss , Dennis Blair , defended his choice in Congress .
Later that afternoon , Mr Blair 's office sent out a note announcing that Mr Freeman was withdrawing his nomination .
Mr Freeman sent out an acerbic letter , accusing the " Israel Lobby " of " plumbing the depths of dishonour and indecency " , using " character assassination " and controlling policy by vetoing people who disagreed with them .
' Deeply insulted '
In an interview with the BBC , Mr Freeman then said he regretted the use of the words " Israel Lobby " saying the campaign had been waged by specific groups aligned with rightwing factions in Israel which he described as the " Likud or ( Avigdor ) Lieberman lobby " .
Mr Freeman 's letter was pounced on by his critics , and others , who said it proved their point
Israel row derails Obama nominee
But he stood by his accusations about a campaign waged against him , saying it was a transparent one for which the Zionist Organisation of America had openly claimed credit .
ZOA 's president Morton Klein told the BBC it was " nonsense , rubbish to say all the pro-Israel organisations were making an issue about him " .
" We were the only ones on Capitol Hill raising concerns about him , " he said .
Mr Freeman added he felt " deeply insulted having been attacked for representing foreign interests by someone who is himself under indictment for espionage for a foreign government " .
' Grotesque libel '
One of those leading the campaign against Mr Freeman online had been Steve Rosen , a former official from the powerful pro-Israel lobby Aipac who was indicted in the US in 2005 , along with a colleague , for violating the Espionage Act by " giving national security information to persons not entitled to receive it " .
Mr Freeman sent a controversial email about the Chinese government 's suppression of protests Mr Freeman 's letter was pounced on by his critics , and others , who said it proved their point .
In its editorial following his withdrawal , the Washington Post described it as " grotesque libel " .
Republican congressman Frank Wolfe also wrote in the Post on Saturday that " while the reports of Freeman 's public statements first raised my concern about his suitability to be chairman of the National Intelligence Council , his words after his withdrawal crystallised exactly why Freeman was the wrong choice for the job " .
Few people dispute that pro-Israel lobbyists were the driving force in the campaign against Mr Freeman , but some observers believe that if his views on Israel had been the only controversial thing about him , it would not have been enough to bring him down .
Mr Wolfe wrote that he had not been contacted by any pro-Israel lobby group and that his concerns were mainly about Mr Freeman 's views on China and Tibet and his ties to foreign governments .
' Tiananmen Square ' email Mr Freeman served on the advisory board of the state - owned China National Offshore Oil Corp ( CNOOC ) for which he was paid $ 10,000 a year .
He was also the president of the Middle East Policy Council , which received funding from Saudi Arabia .
He resigned from the positions before accepting the nomination for the NIC job and says there was nothing improper about either position .
But in an e-mail he sent a few years ago and which has become public , Mr Freeman said that he found plausible " the dominant view in China " which stated that the real mistake of the authorities was not the crackdown on protestors on Tiananmen Square in 1989 but the fact they had not nipped the demonstrations in the bud .
He goes on to say that no government would allow the heart of its capital to be occupied by dissidents and ends his mail by stating " I thus share the hope of the majority in China that no Chinese government will repeat the mistakes of Zhao Ziyang 's dilatory tactics of appeasement in dealing with domestic protesters in China . "
' Indefensible '
The comments are read widely as justification of the Chinese government 's action but Mr Freeman insisted he was reading facts and predicting outcomes , adding that empathy is key to analysis .
Freeman belongs to the camp that 's the mortal enemy of the neoconservatives : the realists .
Realist ideology pays no attention to moral differences between states
Jonathan Chait
Editor , The New Republic " I 'm not justifying , I 'm describing it .
There 's a difference between analysis and policy .
Analysis is an effort to understand the facts and the motivations of those who are creating the facts , Chinese demonstrators or leaders , and then explain that to those who must make decisions about what to do about it . "
His comments on Tibet also drew fire from speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi , who reportedly described them as " indefensible " .
In 2007 , Mr Freeman had said that the American and European posturing on the issue of Tibet would lead to a long term clampdown by the Chinese .
He said he did n't mean to say that the West should stay quiet but that it should expect a Chinese reaction .
The way Mr Freeman 's expresses his views led to criticism that he was an ultra-realist , unconcerned about human rights .
' Blind to moral dimensions ' " Freeman belongs to the camp that 's the mortal enemy of the neoconservatives : the realists .
Realist ideology pays no attention to moral differences between states , " wrote Jonathan Chait , editor of The New Republic .
" ( They ) are the mirror image of neoconservatives in that they are completely blind to the moral dimensions of international politics . "
Mr Freeman said he took it as a compliment .
" It is an extraordinary accusation to accuse someone whose job is analysis of the sin of objectivity .
If you already know what the answer ought to be and then voice it , why go through the pretence of analysis at all , " said Mr Freeman .
" The notion that somehow analysis should bend itself to what is politically expedient is precisely the issue we need to crack . "
Self - censorship
The episode has indeed raised some concern inside the intelligence community .
In an article for Foreign Policy , entitled How to Discourage the Speaking of Truth to Power , former CIA officer Paul Pillar wrote that he remained convinced that " enforcement of political orthodoxy about US policy towards Israel " was at the heart of the affair and the message to intelligence officers was clear - " their work will be acceptable only if it conforms to dominant policy views " .
Mr Pillar ends by saying that the next time the intelligence community fails in its job , the way it did on Iraq 's WMD's , people in Congress and elsewhere should ask themselves " how they could expect intelligence officers to show superlative courage in bucking political orthodoxy when they showed so little themselves " .
In his letter , Mr Freeman also said the affair " will be seen by many to raise serious questions about whether the Obama administration will be able to make its own decisions about the Middle East and related issues " .
But a DC - based advocate on Arab issues said that people like him and others working on Arab and Palestinian issues should learn from the episode and maintain a pragmatic attitude .
" Freeman was very vocal and very strident about Israel , he really identified with the Palestinians and Arabs in particular .
For him it was a case of - support the Palestinians and stand against the Israelis , " said the advocate who wished to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the issue .
" But if you approach it like that , as a zero sum game , the zero will always be for us ( Arabs ) , we can not win .
If we want to make progress , we have to be pragmatic . "
He added that people should not conclude that " they should self - censor on the issue of Israel .
What matters is how you criticise and what are your other alignments and associations .
It 's a good lesson . "

Fox Johnston Architects designed this house in the Mosman neighborhood of Sydney , Australia .
With a view over national parkland and across the ocean to the horizon , this house is designed for easy living and to please the senses .
Yet it is also practical – built with solid , durable , tactile materials .
Bluestone , Anthra - Zinc , glass and wood are combined externally and internally in an environmentally responsive manner .
Visit the website of Fox Johnston Architects – here .
External walls and screens open and close , providing the rooms with privacy or shading .
The narrow width and orientation of the building maximises cross ventilation and sunlight filtration throughout each space .
The building as a whole is designed to create private living spaces away from the street with a central focus on the outdoor living areas .
It takes the form of a series of platforms , responding to the rhythm and topography of the site .
The main living , sleeping and entertaining areas are contained in the long linear form to the west .
An elongated pool bounds this form and transects the building through the entrance hall , forming a shallow pool in the entrance courtyard .
The east wing encloses a living space that serves the barbecue and pool deck , with a separate bedroom and bathroom above .
• ' I hope to arrange for him to stay until 30 June ' – chief executive • Italian club hope to sign 33 - year - old permanently in January
Milan remain intent on extending David Beckham 's loan from Los Angeles Galaxy until the end of June with a view to signing him permanently next year , their chief executive , Adriano Galliani , revealed yesterday .
" Negotiations are getting more intense , " Galliani told the club 's in - house television channel .
" I hope to manage to arrange for him to stay here at least until 30 June on loan .
Then he could return to Los Angeles and come back in January .
It 's a complicated path , as we have always known , but I 'm trying . "
The loan extension is expected to be finalised by the end of the week , the Los Angeles Times reported on its website ( www.latimes.com).
Beckham is due to return to Galaxy on 9 March if a deal is not reached .
The clubs had been in talks over a permanent transfer but were unable to agree on a fee .
The 33 - year - old midfielder initially joined Milan to stay in contention for England selection during the Major League Soccer close season but enjoyed playing top - class football again so much that he set his sights on a long - term stay .
Beckham has settled well , scoring two goals in nine Serie A games , although the level of his recent performances has dipped as Milan have run into some poor form .
The Rossoneri were knocked out of the Uefa Cup by Werder Bremen last Thursday , lost 2 - 1 at Sampdoria on Sunday and are 12 points behind the league leaders , Internazionale .
It ’s a one - man , flying , Cylon - fighting spacecraft — and they ’re selling it on eBay .
NBC / Universal is auctioning an actual Raptor fighter ship used in Battlestar Galactica .
( Also up for sale ?
A Mark VII Viper Full Size . )
“ It has a full , functional interior with light - up panels and monitors throughout … ” reads eBay ’s enthusiastic description of the 30 - foot ship .
After 43 bids , the price was $ 28,100.00 — but this did n’t meet the auction ’s reserve , which means it ’s still up for grabs at a “ live ” auction beginning May 8 in Pasadena .
“ I think we ’re going to have a Cylon ship as well , ” says Curtis Short , operations manager for the auction site , Propworx .
“ You ’re going to walk in and you ’re going to feel like you ’re in a hangar bay . ”
Actors from the show will also be available for photographs — and bids will also be accepted through the Auction Network , which will be streaming a live broadcast of the auction .
( And if you ’re busy fighting Cylons , the site allows you to leave behind a proxy bid ) .
But the Battlestar ’s fighter craft are already drawing the biggest bids .
“ I get e-mails all the time from pilots , ” says Short .
“ ‘ Oh , that ’s great .
I wish I could afford that .
Even though I ca n’t fly it — but if I could , I would . ’
Everybody ’s asking where do I put it ?
‘ Do I got to build a garage for it ?
How big is it ?
My wife ’s going to kill me if I buy it , ’ and that kind of stuff . ”
The Raptor will have to be disassembled for transport , according to Short , “ because it ’s too wide — it wo n’t fit in the trailer on the truck . ”
eBay ’s listing warns that the buyer is responsible “ for all shipping , crating and handling charges , which will be sent to the buyer as a separate invoice ” — and adds that the Mark VII Viper craft can be purchased through PayPal , cashiers check , money order or bank wire transfer .
Both ships racked up over 40 bids apiece ( starting as low as $ 1.00 ) — but who ’s making the bids ?
“ I have no idea , ” admits Short . ”
It can be anybody . ”
For example , eBay ’s history shows that one bidder has placed 30 bids in the last 30 days for World War II - era collectibles — plus one $ 21,200 bid for Battlestar Galactica ’s Mark VII Viper .
And for the upcoming live auction , Propworx has sent out “ hundreds and hundreds and hundreds ” of catalogs , getting daily requests “ from all over the world … all countries in Europe , Australia , Japan … ”
In addition , through weekly eBay auctions over the last three months , the company has already auctioned off more than 1,800 other props from the show “ Every week we have approximately 150 items up , ” says Short .
“ It ’s an easy outlet , and everybody knows eBay , and it ’s really easy to use . ”
Flight jackets are going for up to $ 2,000 , but for $ 10.51 , you can serve your guests Aerilon table salt or for $ 53 , a bottle of imported Virgon - brew beer .
There ’s a colonial Presidential election ballot ( listing candidates Gaius Baltar and Laura Roslin ) , and a Hanger Bay Sign for $ 212.50 .
A 500 cubit note goes for $ 77.82 .
You can even buy flight manuals for the Battlestar ’s aircraft — evasive procedures , weapons control , maintenance , and flight deck security .
“ We sell paper — auction off paper from the show , ” says Short , “ and people love it .
It ’s definitely something that people love to have their hands on — a piece of TV history .
But when using an earth - based interface , is n’t there a danger that it ’s been infiltrated by humanity - destroying Cylons ?
“ No , ” replies Short .
“ It ’s not Cylons . ”
In fact , he ’s been surprised by the surge of humanity that ’s been bidding on some of the items .
“ Last week we had some rank pins that sold for $ 4,500 .
People collect all the pins for the ranks — and also , patches are really big . ”
Every item is marked with a hologram of the Battlestar Galactica logo to verify its authenticity , and since no reserve price is set for any of these props , “ whatever it goes for , it goes , ” says Short .
“ It starts out at 99 cents , and then whatever we can get . ”
Some people place bids on all the items associated with a specific character — you can buy Gaeta ’s dog tags for $ 102.50 — but other props are reminiscent of the show ’s location .
You can purchase a napkin from Joe ’s Bar for only 99 cents , a Caprican Imperial cigar box for $ 82.00 , or a genuine tool set from the Hangar bay workbench for only $ 32 .
And for $ 102.50 , you can be cuffing your kinky date with genuine Cylon handcuffs .
Battlestar Galactica may be only the beginning , with other shows in the future auctioning their props online .
“ There ’s shows out there that people absolutely love , and they would love to get their hand on just a simple piece of it . ”
But truthfully , one fan gets to handle every item — Curtis himself .
“ It ’s cool to watch the show and say ‘ Hey , I know that prop .
I ’ve touched that …
I mean , you see everything — everything in the show is in our warehouse .
We handle it every day . ”
It ’s a real thrill , and he says that when fans tour the facility , “ They ’re freaking out .
“ It ’s just like heaven . ”

These days , the federal regulatory agencies that oversee and regulate the nation 's financial affairs justifiably are drawing the most criticism for failing to do their jobs , but the Food and Drug Administration is n't far behind .
The reason is obvious .
Americans increasingly are convinced that the FDA can no longer meet its mandate to protect them from contaminated food , drugs , medical devices and a variety of other products .
There is considerable evidence to support that belief .
The current recall of nearly 3,000 peanut products that could be contaminated by salmonella is the latest manifestation of the FDA 's woes .
Within the past year or so , the FDA also has had to deal with a salmonella outbreak traced to hot peppers , death - dealing syringes manufactured in unsterile conditions , pet food laced with contaminants and a blood thinner imported from China that caused life - threatening allergies .
In every instance , the FDA reacted to reports of problems rather than preventing the problems from occurring .
Perhaps it is too much to ask a single agency to oversee the production of so many items in so many places around the globe .
It certainly is unfair to require the FDA to do so with the funding it currently receives and at present staffing levels .
That 's simply not possible .
The peanut product recall is indicative of the problem .
Once reports of salmonella in peanut products were brought to the FDA 's attention , inspectors quickly traced the outbreak to the Peanut Corp. of America plant in Blakely , Ga .
Once there , though , the inspectors were hamstrung by antiquated rules that prevented them from gaining rapid access to internal company reports .
Without those reports or other evidence , the agents had no authority to order a recall .
It was only after inspectors resorted to bioterror laws that they obtained incriminating reports .
These indicated that the company knew salmonella was present , but that it nevertheless continued to ship products for nine months .
No wonder the company was reluctant to provide the information .
Inadequate staffing makes it impossible for the FDA to inspect all the plants under its jurisdiction on a regular basis .
Some , indeed , go years without an inspection .
Some companies like it that way .
Others turn to private inspectors to assure the public that they are being protected from contaminated items .
That can be a mixed blessing .
Done properly , the private reports are thorough and reliable .
Sometimes , though , it is a flawed system that operates without proper oversight .
That obviously was the case with the Peanut Corp. of America .
A private inspector - paid for by the company in what clearly was a conflict of interest - visited the plant which processes millions of pounds of peanuts monthly .
He had a day to do the job .
When he protested that was not adequate , the company said they 'd allow more time next year .
He conducted his inspection anyway , turning in a report that , according to a copy obtained by The New York Times , said the food safety level at the plant was " superior . "
In retrospect , the verdict was hardly surprising .
The inspector was unaware that peanuts were susceptible to salmonella .
Even if he had known , he was not required to test for it .
The result : A salmonella outbreak - one of the worst in U.S. history - in which at least 9 people died and more than 22,000 became ill .
Consumers deserve better .
If Americans are to be protected from similar events , the Obama administration and Congress should revamp the FDA and provide the tools and manpower for it to do its job .
The George W. Bush administration short - shrifted the agency 's budget for years , making it difficult to retain or hire trained staff and to purchase equipment and computers vital to large - scale inspections .
The result , as Americans have learned to their chagrin , was as predictable as it was dangerous .
The situation is changing .
Congress , perhaps energized by rising public discontent spurred by recent recalls , seems willing to funnel more money into the FDA .
President Obama indicates that he might be agreeable to systemic changes at the FDA if that creates an agency able to meet its mandate in a prompt , reliable manner .
That 's a start .
Additional funding and presidential interest are welcome .
But if the FDA is to again be a trustworthy first line of defense against tainted products , more money and sustained interest in agency operations will be required .
Increasing numbers of gardeners and allotment owners are cultivating strawberries and other summer fruits to save money .
The Royal Horticultural Society ( RHS ) reports that 66 per cent of people it surveyed consider melons , strawberries and raspberries as expensive luxury treats , and that 37 per cent are planning to grow their own fruit as a way to save money over the coming year .
The results show a rising trend for " edible gardening " : the number of people surveyed who grow their own food has leapt from 29 per cent a year ago to 88 per cent today , according to a study made of visitors to the RHS website .
Sales of seeds for edible plants rose from £ 87 m in 2004 to £ 118 m last year , according to the Horticultural Trades Association .
In the same period , sales of fruit trees and plants rose from £ 23 m to £ 30 m .

Seed companies are predicting record sales this year .
The boom in strawberry growing serves as a symbol of how the economic climate is fuelling a return to gardening for the table on a scale not seen in decades .
Demand is such that last month the National Trust announced plans to turn over land from sites around the country to people wanting to grow food .
The three - year plan will see an area of land capable of producing about £ 1.5 m of fruit and vegetables entrusted to individuals and community groups .
The return to growing vegetables has prepared the ground for the rising numbers now cultivating their own fruit , said Tom Sharples , the marketing manager at Suttons Seeds .
" We have seen fruit sales go up by something like 20 per cent in the past year , with the main increases in soft fruits like blackcurrants , redcurrants and strawberries .
I think a boom in strawberry growing is inevitable , particularly as people are able to grow varieties that are different to those in the supermarket , which are often criticised for being tasteless . "
The seed supplier Thompson and Morgan said it has seen a four - fold increase in fruit plant sales over the past few years .
Even B&Q is getting in on the act .
Next month it will launch a new range of strawberry plants in time for spring planting ; mature plants will have been planted in September last year .
The retailer said that people who grow their own produce could save more than £ 200 a year .
" Growing your own fruit and vegetables is a trend which is gaining momentum .
Strawberries are a popular choice because they 're easy to grow and do n't need a lot of space , " said Joclyn Silezin , its horticulture buyer .
Helen Bostock , the gardening adviser at the RHS , said : " Strawberries and other soft fruits have become a luxury item in many people 's shopping baskets and are getting prohibitively expensive to buy as part of weekly shop .
" We are seeing people who started growing their own vegetables last year now moving on to try soft fruits like strawberries and raspberries . "
FOOD ALLERGY NUMBERS FOOD ALLERGY NUMBERS Enlarge Photodisc About one in 25 Americans , or more than 12 million , have food allergies , according to the Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network .
More food allergy facts from the network :
About 7 million Americans are allergic to seafood ; 3.3 million are allergic to peanuts or tree nuts , such as walnuts , almonds and pecans .
Eight foods account for 90 % of allergic reactions to food in the USA : milk , eggs , peanuts , tree nuts , wheat , soy , fish and shellfish .
Anaphylaxis , a serious allergic reaction that comes on quickly , caused by food kills up to 150 Americans each year and sends 50,000 to the emergency room .

At a scientific meeting this week , they 're reporting on an experimental treatment that has freed a small number of children from their allergies .
More than 3 million Americans are allergic to peanuts or tree nuts , such as walnuts , and , for reasons that are n't clear , the number seems to be rising .
About half of the 150 deaths caused by food allergies in the USA each year are caused by peanut allergies .
FOOD ALLERGIES :
On the rise for kids BETTER LIFE : Allergy studies in the news Only 20 % of children with peanut allergies outgrow them .
The rest must stay vigilant , bringing their own food to parties and avoiding restaurants if they can't be sure the menu is " peanut - safe . "
An allergic response usually strikes within minutes of exposure .
The new therapy works similarly to allergy shots , which have n't proved safe against food allergies .
Exposure to increasing amounts of peanut flour gradually builds up tolerance .
Blood tests show that the immune system begins to ignore the peanut flour instead of attacking it .
Children start with the lowest dose of peanut flour they can take without a reaction — just one one - thousandth of a peanut in some cases , says Wesley Burks , chief of pediatric allergy at Duke University .
Duke is collaborating on the research with the Arkansas Children 's Hospital .
The children go home with precisely measured daily doses for two weeks and then return for tests and two weeks of slightly larger doses to be mixed in food .
In one study , subjects ate flour equal to 15 peanuts a day after eight to 10 months of this .
Nine of 33 have or had been on that maintenance dose for 2½ years .
After " challenges " in which they were asked to eat peanuts , four of the nine were declared ready to stop treatment .
For now , at least , those four still must eat peanuts every day .
Other studies have shown that " as long as you keep something in your diet , your tolerance stays , " Burks says .
He cautions that the treatment should n't be tried outside a research study in which subjects are closely monitored .
The researchers also are conducting a trial in which 10 children were randomly assigned to get either peanut flour or a placebo flour .
After a year , all five who had been getting peanut flour could tolerate a challenge of about 13 peanuts ; those on placebo could tolerate only one peanut .
" Within the next five years , I think we 're going to have some active therapy for food allergy , " says Burk 's collaborator , Stacie Jones of Arkansas Children 's Hospital .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - A suicide bomber killed at least 28 people in an attack on tribal leaders and security officials in western Baghdad on Tuesday , the second big attack in the Iraqi capital in three days .
An Iraqi flag flutters from a government building in Baghdad April 15 , 2008 .

Security spokesman Major - General Qassim Moussawi said the bombing killed 28 people and wounded 28 others as dignitaries toured a crowded market in the Abu Ghraib district .
State TV footage showed bodies strewn across the blast site .
But other official sources put the toll as high as 33 dead and 52 wounded , saying that security personnel , civilians , women and children were killed .
Officials have often blamed Sunni Islamist al Qaeda or militants loyal to Saddam Hussein ’s banned Baath party for such blasts .
Iraq ’s Shi’ite - led government says it is trying to repair ties with its Sunni minority after years of bloodshed .
“ Reconciliation is the response to the devilish acts that try to wreck nationalist efforts , ” government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh said of the bombing .
Al - Baghdadiya , an independent television station , said two of its journalists were killed in the attack .
A journalist at Al - Iraqiya state television said four colleagues were wounded .
“ We heard a huge explosion , then there was haphazard shooting on us from somewhere far away and the army fired back , ” said Iraqiya cameraman Raed Qassim , a friend of both killed journalists who carried a wounded colleague to hospital .
“ I am in shock , I ca n’t eat , I ca n’t sleep .
I keep seeing images of my friends dying and I ca n’t help them , ” he said .
Abu Ghraib mayor Shakir Fiza said a senior Interior Ministry official was headed to a tribal reconciliation conference in Abu Ghraib ’s municipal headquarters .
The official got out of his car and was talking to people at the market when the bomber struck .
RECONCILIATION ELUSIVE
While violence has dropped sharply in Iraq since the height of the sectarian and insurgent killing unleashed by the U.S. - led invasion in 2003 , insurgents still stage regular attacks , especially in the volatile northern city of Mosul .
On Tuesday , a car bomb killed two civilians and wounded six people in al - Hamdaniya , just east of Mosul .
The improvement in security has been particularly effective in Baghdad , where Iraqis are cautiously resuming a more normal life .
Yet violence continues to strike there .
On Sunday , a suicide bomber killed 28 people at the main police academy .
“ We expect these things to happen from time to time , especially when there are political openings bringing together different parties , ” said security spokesman Tahseen al - Sheikhli , blaming al Qaeda or Baath party loyalists for the attack .
Political analyst Hazim al - Nuaimi said that officials should not be so quick to blame al Qaeda .
“ These attacks raise questions about political power struggles , ” he said .
The latest attack took place days after the United States said it would reduce its 140,000 troops before a full withdrawal date by the end of 2011 , which has led some to wonder whether local forces will be ready to prevent Iraq sliding back into large - scale war .
In Washington , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters he was not aware of any concerns that President Barack Obama ’s announcement that all combat troops would be withdrawn by the end of August 2010 encouraged such attacks .
“ I know the president and the team remain committed to ensuring that Iraq is a stable and secure country , ” he said .
Reconciliation among rival political factions is proving even more difficult than combating insurgents .
Different factions remain deeply suspicious of each other .
Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki , a Shi’ite whose political fortunes were strengthened following local polls , has stepped up calls for reconciliation in the past few days .
But many opponents see such calls as rhetoric and accuse Maliki ’s government of blocking steps to reincorporate thousands of former Baath party members , who were fired by U.S. authorities in 2003 , back into the government .
_ Linusのバカ発言はどうかと思う。
Subversion はSubversionで素晴らしいし、作ってる人たちは絶対バカじゃないよ。焦点の当て所が違うというだけだよね。
_ が、それはそれとして 、Git( とGitHub ) が提供するワークフローは非常に素晴らしい。それは認めよう。
というわけで、重い腰を上げてGitを触ってみることにする。
_ ではま ずGitのインストールから。
_ うち はWindowsで、まあそうすると当然のようにcygwinでバイナリ配布があるわけだけど、cygwinのシェルじゃなくコマンドプロンプトで生活してる人にとってはcygwin版というのは非常に不便だったりする。
滅多に引数にパス名を指定することがない、とかなら害はぜんぜんないんだけど、この手のツールでパス名の指定に苦労するととてもじゃないがやってらんないということはcvsとsvnで嫌というほど身にしみている。
というわけで 、Windowsネイティブなバイナリは... ... ...... え、ないの ?
_ いや、あるにはある。msysgit。
今、 「あるにはある」というネガティブな表現をしたけど、たぶんこれはすごく頑張っている代物だと思う。偉い。
でもね、偉いんだけど、まだβというかなんというか、とにかく作ってる人たちが「リリース版」と認めたものが存在しないのよ。
たぶん、そこには技術的な残存課題以外の理由があったりして、今存在するpreviewとかいうのもほとんど問題はないんだろう、とかいうことも推測できるんだけど、やはり正式なリリース版でない開発ツールを常用するというのはちょっと敷居が高い。
もちろん、敢えてそういうところに飛び込んでドッグフード食うのも一つの生き方なんだけど、個人的にはそれはrubyだけでもう十分だ。
_ もうこれで諦めてもいいんだけど、とりあえ ずWindowsネイティブなバイナリの方は将来に期待することにして保留として、うちのもう一つの環境であるNetBSDの方でGitを使ってみることにしよう。
とうぜんpkgsrcに ... ... あれ、ないよ ?
と思ったら、devel/scmgitという名前で存在した。どうやらmiscにgitというパッケージがあって名前がぶつかったのが原因らしい。
ふーん 、Git作った人は( って Linusなんだけど ) そんなことも調べないで名前付けたんだねえ。昔ならいざ知らず、このご時世にねえ...
ま、当事者でもないのに嫌味を言っても仕方ないので、インストールしよう。
... あれ、GNU tarなんか入れだした。なあ、コマンド作る過程で絶対にGNUのtarが必要な理由があるのか?
そりゃいったいどんな理由だよ。
で、次 はPerlが必要なのか。まあそれはよくあることなんだが...
おい、なんで5.10以上が必要なんだよ。お前はPerl5.10のどの機能が構築に絶対不可欠だっつーんだ。
うちは5.8でPerlの環境ができあがってて、必要性すらまだ証明できてない開発ツール1個のためにその環境を壊すわけにはいかねーんだよ!
というわけでpkgsrcから入れるのは断念。
これはたぶ んGitが悪いんじゃなくて、パッケージ作った人が悪いんだろう。
_ 仕方ないので、あんまり気は進まないが野良ビルドすることにする。
tarball拾ってきて展開して、えーとconfigure ... ... が、ないね。
Makefileは既にある。かなり嫌な予感がしたが、とりあえずINSTALLファイルを見てみよう。
それによるといきなり make でいいよとか書いてあるわけだが、それを鵜呑みにできるほど無邪気な人生は送ってきていない。
続きを読むと make configure で configure 作ってそっから始めることもできる、と書いてあるのでそっちへ進むことにする。
で、実行すると ... エラーだらけ。
ああ、これはもう慣れてるからすぐわかる、GNU makeじゃないとダメなわけね。
gmake configure っと。 ... 今度は大丈夫。
とりあえずいったん ./ configure -- prefix= /usr / local とやってみたが、 - lcrypto が yes で - lcurl が no で - lexpat が no で... ってこれはまずい 。
libcurlやlibexpatは
/usr / pkg/lib
に存在するわけで、できれば使っていただきたい。また、うちの環境ではlibcryptoは
/usr /lib と /usr/pkg/lib の両方にあったりするんだけど、これも後者を使っていただきたいのだが、libcurlやlibexpatを見つけられなかったのにlibcryptoが見つかってるということは、前者を使ってしまっているのだろう。
ま、常識だとこの手のパスの指定はconfigureの引数にあるはずなので、 ./ configure -- help してみる。予想通り、 -- with-curl 、 -- with-expat 、 -- with-openssl でそれぞれパスが指定できるようになっている。
というわけでそれら全部に /usr / pkg を指定してやり直し... ても、やっぱり no とか言いやがる。なんでやねん 。
しばらく引数の指定の仕方をいろいろ試したりしたが、どうしてもうまく行かない。諦めてconfigureスクリプトそのものを読んでみる。
... configureの引数の指定とconfigureがやってるチェックとが、ぜんぜんまったくこれっぽちも関係ないんでやんの。configureで実行されるチェックは引数で指定したパスとは無関係。で、チェック結果とはぜんぜん関係なしに、引数で指定したパスがmake時に使われるファイルに変数として指定されているようだ。
まあ、そうだよね 。Git作った人にとっちゃLinuxできちんと動けば十分だろうしね。
気を取り直して 、configureはこれでよかったことにして make 、じゃなくて gmake 。
なんかいちおう正常に終わった。 gmake doc したらasciidocがないとか言ってたけど、docなんかもうどうでもいいや。 gmake install 。
入れてから、嫌な予感がしたので ldd git してみる 。
ああ、思ったとおり 、
/usr/pkg/lib/libcrypto.so と /usr/lib/libcrypto.so と両方にリンクしてる。ま、あんないい加減なconfigureじゃ当然そうだよな。
手を入れてどうにかする気力もないので見なかったことにしよう。
_ さて、ここまで延々と付き合って読んでくれた人は当然気付いてるだろうけど、仮にかつて私がGitに対して好意を抱いていたとしても、もはやそんなもんは一片のかけらも残ってはいない。
実際にはもともと好意なんか持ってなかったので、残っているのは敵意だけである。
それでもここまで作業を進めたのは、前述したようにGitとGitHubで実現されるであろうワークフローに非常に大きい期待があるからである。
ここまでで出会った山のようなクソには目をつぶって、輝かしい未来に向かって先に進むことにしよう。
_ ではま ずGitの使い方から。
とりあえずオフィシャルのドキュメントに当たってみることにしよう。
とりあえず、体験したいのは、既存の誰かのレポジトリを手元でいじることなので、参考例は...
Exampleがあった 。 Tony Luck がLinuxカーネルをIA64版メンテナとしていじる例、らしい。
ふむ、私 がGitを使う際に想定される例に非常に似ている気がする。見てみよう。
えーと 、Andrewが-mm、って何それ ? git-fetchにgit-remoteねえ。で、それはいつどこで使うの?
え、youって誰 ? 私?
これTonyの話じゃないの ?
... ふむ、よくわかった 。Linux知らない人はわからんでいいですよ、ってことだね。
世間の人たちがRubyのドキュメントがどうとかこうとか叩く理由がすごーーーーくよく理解できた気がするよ。
それでもRubyは『初めてのRuby』読んで『たのしいRuby』読んで『プログラミング言語Ruby』読めば済むわけだけど、Gitは何読めばいいの?
... え、ないの ? へーそうなんだ。
_ そろそろ敵意が殺意に変わってきたんだけど、いったい何にこの殺意を向ければいいんだろうね。
しかし、ここは忍耐力を限界まで振り絞って、一連の操作は気合で理解したことにする。
Linusさんがバカにして たSubversionについての知識がなければまったく理解できないままだったと思うけどね!
_ では実際になんかいじってみることにしよう。
しかし、さしあたって現在GitHubにあるプロジェクトで、さっそく触ってみたい、というものはない。しかし、ちょうど手元にnadokaさん用の私家パッチが転がっているので、GitHubにnadokaさんのプロジェクトを勝手に作ってそれにこのパッチを入れてみることにする。
実はなぜか既 にGitHubにアカウントは持っているので、プロジェクトの作成から。
プロジェクトはアカウントにぶら下がるので、Project Nameは他人との衝突を恐れる必要はないらしい。というわけでnadokaでOK。
「 Create Repository 」 すると、持ってるレポジトリを入れろや的な説明が出てくるわけだけど、ここではnadokaさんのSubversionレポジトリをimportすることにする。
ぽち、ぽち、と進むと、svnユーザko1とznzの実名を入れろや、とか言われる。
実名つっても例を見る限りメールアドレスがほしいんだろうけど...
まあ知ってるわけだけど、二人ともGitHubにアカウント持ってるんだよねえ。
ここで彼ら がGitHubに登録したメールアドレスを入れると結び付けてくれたりするんだろうか?
それとも単にGit的な都合で情報がほしいだけなのだろうか?
なお、両方入れるか両方入れないかどっちかにしろ、的なことも言っているので、何も入れないという選択肢もある。うーん。
... 考えてもわからないので、ko1とznzとだけ入れといたらGitHubアカウントと結び付けてくれたりしねーかな、とか思いながら先に進んでみる。
...
...
...
「 Hardcore Importing Action」とかいう説明が出たまま、importが終わらない 。
終わらないんだけど、GitHubからメールが届いた。曰く、「失敗したよ。ko1って誰?
ま、やり直してよ」
どうも、やっぱりさっきのはちゃんとメールアドレスを入れないといけなかったらしい。
うーん、それなら何も入れない方がよさそうだな。
で、やり直すための説明によると、えーと、手動でやれ、ってか。
確か にWebの画面にはimportをやり直せそうな表示は一切ない。というか、まだ「 Hardcore Importing Action 」のままなんですけど。
うーん、あれだ けGit入れるのに苦労したことを考えると、この上svn2gitとかgit-svnとかすんなり入れられる気がしない。というかできることならもうGit絡みのものは何も入れたくない。
というわけで、さっき作ったプロジェクトは削除して最初からやり直そう。
_ ... というわけで今度はアカウント情報のところで何も入れないということで、ちゃんとimportが完了したというメールが来た。ぱちぱちぱち。
Webは相変わら ず 「 Hardcore Importing Action 」のままだけどね。
ま、たぶんレポジトリの情報がWebに反映されるまでちょびっと時間がかかるのだろう、と好意的に受け止めておいて、できたはずのレポジトリをさっそくローカルでいじってみることにする。
git clone は... おお、成功した。
とりあえ ずmaster ブランチはいじらないことにして、 git branch exprimental で exprimental ブランチを作る。そして git checkout exprimental で今手元にあるこのソースツリーの向いてる先 をexperimentalブランチにする 。
どうやらここまでは理解は正しそうな雰囲気。
ではこのソースツリーに既にある私家パッチを適用して、 git commit -a 。
そしてこ のcommit結果 をGitHubに反映するために git push して ... ふむ、成功したらしい。
ではGitHub側がどうなった かWebを見てみよう。
...
「 Hardcore Importing Action 」
...
...
いやあのさ、もうさっきから1時間は経ってるんですけど。いくらなんでも反映されるの遅すぎじゃね?
_ こりゃなんか問題を踏んだかな、というわけで 、Supportサイトで " Hardcore Importing Action " で検索してみると ...
出るわ出るわ山のように。
「 ごめんね直したよ」とかいう返答がついているものもあれば、数日放置された後「今見たら問題ないみたいだけど?」とかいう返答がついてるものもある。
「 『ごめんね直したよ』ばっかりだけど、つまりそっちでなんか作業しない限りどうしようもないってことなわけ?」と言ってる人もいる。
ふーん、そうですか 。
_ というわけで、使ってみた結論 。
いやあ、素晴らしい。GitとGitHubを使えば、開発ワークフローが劇的に変化することは間違いないね!
だって二度とこんなもん使った開発なんか関わるもんか、って心の底から納得できちゃうんだから。
_ ... まあ、そんなこと言いつつも、いつの日か「 Hardcore Importing Action」が解消される日が来たら、もうちょっとだけ触ってみるつもりではある。
とはいえ、現時点でも一つだけ断言できることがある。
Rubyの開発レポジトリがGit＋GitHubに移行するような日が来たら、それでRubyとはお別れだ。
CONCORD , N.H. — The House has voted to make New Hampshire the third state allowing gays to marry two years after they granted them the right to enter into civil unions .
The House voted 186-179 to send the bill to the Senate .
The first attempt to pass the bill fell one vote short , but opponents were unable to kill it .
The House then reconsidered and passed the measure .
Two years ago , the Legislature approved civil unions for gays , but some proponents of joining Connecticut and Massachusetts in allowing marriage said the time is n't right in New Hampshire .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama pledged on Monday to cut the ballooning U.S. budget deficit by half in the next four years and said the country would face another economic crisis if it did not address its debt problems soon .

Obama , whose month - old administration has pushed through a $ 787 billion economic stimulus package to try to jolt the country out of recession , said the need for massive spending now did not mean U.S. budget problems could wait until later .
“ If we confront this crisis without also confronting the deficits that helped cause it , we risk sinking into another crisis down the road , ” Obama told participants at the opening of a White House summit on “ fiscal responsibility . ”
Leaders from business , labor , and both political parties attended the White House meeting , which focused on ways to improve the U.S. budget outlook by cutting healthcare costs , reforming military procurement and revamping tax policies .
Obama , who rolls out his first budget on Thursday , stressed the urgency of acting quickly and emphasized he inherited a $ 1.3 trillion deficit with interest payments in 2008 alone at $ 250 billion -- three times more than the country spent on education .
“ We cannot and will not sustain deficits like these without end , ” he said .
“ Today I ’m pledging to cut the deficit we inherited by half by the end of my first term in office . ”
Obama , a Democrat , took over from former Republican President George W. Bush last month .
His current term in office goes through January 2013 .
The president highlighted healthcare reform -- one of his key promises during the 2008 campaign -- as crucial to bolstering the country ’s fiscal position .
He announced a healthcare summit would take place next week and said Republican and Democratic participants on Monday agreed action on the issue was needed this year .
In another potential budget cut , Obama cast doubt over an expensive project by Lockheed Martin Corp to replace the presidential helicopter .
“ The helicopter I have now seems perfectly adequate to me , ” he said to laughter from the audience that included former Republican presidential rival John McCain , a fierce critic of defense procurement policies .
REASSURE MARKETS , FOCUS ON HEALTH CARE
Obama needs to reassure markets he has a responsible attitude toward the deficit and wants to show fiscal discipline that will keep interest rates down and the economy in shape .
The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 fell to 12 - year lows on Monday as investors dumped shares on uncertainty about the U.S. government ’s ability to stabilize the financial system .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs sought to play down fears of bank nationalizations , saying Obama favored leaving banks in private investors ’ hands .
“ The president believes that a privately held banking system regulated by the federal government is the best way to go , ” Gibbs told a regular briefing .
The idea of nationalizing banks is anathema to much of the U.S. public and many politicians , who describe it as socialism that flies in the face of a free - market tradition .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Although his administration has focused its energies on pulling the United States out of recession and addressing the financial sector problems that sparked it , Obama also wants to make good on campaign promises such as extending healthcare benefits to uninsured Americans and fighting climate change .
His budget director , Peter Orszag , said reducing healthcare costs was critical to easing U.S. economic ills .
“ The single most important thing we can do to put the nation back on a sustainable ( fiscal ) course is slow healthcare costs , ” he said .
Participants at the meeting divided up into working groups to discuss ways to deal with healthcare , the Social Security entitlement program and federal contracting .
Afterward , they bantered with Obama , who urged leaders to set aside politics to address the budget issue .
Prominent Republicans including House of Representatives Minority Leader John Boehner attended .
Boehner and other Republicans , who have lambasted the president ’s stimulus package , called for a federal spending freeze .
“ President Obama has called for both parties to get serious about fiscal responsibility , ” Boehner said in a statement .
“ With our budget deficit potentially reaching $ 3 trillion this year , Republicans stand ready to work with him , and we believe we should start right now . ”
Republican Senator Orin Hatch , who did not attend the summit , called it a photo opportunity .
“ Convening groups to talk about deficits and holding a photo - op is n’t going to pay off our debts , ” he said in a statement .
At first glance , we actually gagged upon seeing the jacket pictured above .
Immediately after regaining our composure , we wondered how on Earth such a magnificent piece of retro kit could have such a negative impact on our lives -- then , it hit us .
It 's the dude .
Seriously .
Strap this $ 200 , limited run jacket on anyone even remotely beautiful and we'd bet you too would see things differently .
Or maybe it is just obscenely tacky , but it'd be much less so on anyone other than this fellow .

You ’ve likely , at some point in your life , been in the company of someone who says something akin to , “ I do n’t give money to panhandlers .
They ’re just going to spend it on drugs and / or booze . ”
“ They do this for a living .
That man probably just bungs it in a savings account at the end of the day . ”
“ They ’re bums .
They failed at life .
They do n’t deserve my hard - earned money . ”
Or , maybe , this person is you .
I grew up listening to countless versions of the ideology of “ Son , we do n’t reward failure . ”
You have to hold your own .
You have to work hard and carry your weight .
You have to straighten up and fly right .
You have to contribute something to get something back .
You do n’t want to live in some welfare state where people get rewarded for being bums .
Well , guess what :
We ’ve got it .
But the bums are n’t beggars on the street .
The bums are n’t addicts living for the next fix , veterans scrounging for shelter rent , teenage runaways ( sometimes forcibly ejected from their homes , mind you ) , solitary women escaping abusive relationships and single moms with nobody to turn to , the sick with no access to medical facilities , once prosperous people who went bankrupt by any number of methods ( illness , gambling , substance abuse , traumatic events of all stripes ) , or anyone in any number of circumstances , largely thanks to the lack of a support system , that can lead to such poverty .
( Go into a homeless shelter , or a country club , or an office building , or a construction site , or a patch of farmland , or a prison , or an airport , or a tenement , or a subway station , or a gated community .
Ask a few people what their shoe size is .
I guarantee that you ’ll find at least one pair , anywhere you go , that your feet would fit into as well . )
Those I ’m talking about get your handouts whether you choose to give or not :
People who set out to succeed in business by failing in business .
People who shit in solid gold toilets and wipe the brown text onto your pink slip .
Who cares how badly you fuck up if you get out rich and you leave some sucker holding the bag , right ?
Right .
Especially if that sucker is a taxpayer , to whose chest you ’ve affixed a smelly pink slip .
We ’re their support system .
We have rewarded bums .
Working people have rewarded failure and propped up fuckups , and with TARP , we made it fashionable to do so outright .
We have created the welfare state those plastic chattering wind - up teeth in Congressional offices , and through radio waves , and at $ 1,000 - a - plate luncheons have been bleating on about all these years .
All the while they were crusading to keep that “ hard - earned money ” out of the hands of the evil , filthy , scheming , sinister poor who go out of their way to avoid joining the workforce by any means necessary just to stick their greedy , slimy hands directly into your pocket and ninja - kick the food out of the mouths of your children –the “ Welfare Queens™ , ” it turns out , were , all along , parasitic sacks of shit some call “ business leaders , ” with the ( tacit and explicit alike ) blessing and backing of your government representatives and their backup band of “ experts . ”
The latest wealth redistribution spree on behalf of said Coalition of Overprivileged and Insulated Asshats was thanks to one of their own .
I have found myself repeatedly using lines much like the ones in the first paragraph when grudgingly cutting tax payment checks .
Early in my life as a taxpaying citizen , I felt as though it was my duty , regardless .
Even if you do n’t like what they ’re doing with the money , you might as well pay up so you have a shot at changing things with it .
If nothing else , being honest on your taxes prevents badness later in the event of an audit .
And they take it right out of your paycheck !
How sweet is that ?
I do n’t remember exactly when , during this decade , it first dawned on me , but when I started making quarterly tax payments from money I ’d kept laying around , and had to see it directly leaving my checking account and entering the Treasury , I thought :
“ Why should I give them this money ?
They ’re just going to spend it on bombs .
Why should I support another person ’s bad decisions out of my own pocket ? ”
As I cut the last tax payment for 2008 , I thought to myself : “ Why should I give this money to those bums ?
They ’re just going to spend it on caviar , private jets , golfing , corporate bonuses and parties .
And more bombs . ”
Parties , indeed .
Think of it this way : Somebody takes out a massive credit line in your name , and he and his friends use it to throw lavish balls at your house while you ’re busy at work .
They trash every room , fuck on every surface possible , clog your toilet , flood your bathroom , eat everything in your fridge , and leave their empties , roaches and cigarette butts everywhere .
Half of your records are scratched and the other half are missing entirely .
One of them hires his brother ’s cleaning company to straighten the place up , but the crew does so by stuffing whatever will fit under your rugs and couch cushions and setting fire to whatever is left .
Your mattress and boxspring are slashed open , your closets and dressers are raided and all available cash is mysteriously gone .
Your kitchen is replenished with store brand gruel , canned green beans packed in high fructose corn syrup , and government cheese .
There ’s a partially shredded banner hanging in your living room that reads :
“ MISSION ACCOMPLISHED CONGRADULATIONS ON YOU’RE PARTY FRED ”
( For this exercise , your name is Fred . Or Freda . )
You come home from a hard day to the sight of toilet paper - covered shrubberies and the smell of smoke , urine and stale cigarettes wafting through a broken front window .
A thick American Excess bill awaits inside your mailbox , from which a pair of lightly soiled and charred panties , still smoking , hangs .
The charges include a giant cash advance to reimburse your fellow revelers and cleaning company for the cost of organizing and throwing the gala , and “ housesitting . ”
Another envelope contains a new card with your name on it ( do n’t worry your pretty little head about it — they ’ll authorize the new charges for you ) .
New cards and statements will continue to arrive , and cash advances will be taken out on your behalf to make the minimum payments on those that came previous .
( Or , to put it another way , think of the Dead Milkmen ’s “ Bitchin ’ Camaro , ” except you ’re the one making the payments and buying the gas . )
Not to worry if you fall behind , which you surely will .
On your unceremonious death , the balance will be transferred to an unsuspecting 18 - year - old .
Just shut up and keep eating — there will always be enough credit for your next meal , they assure you .
A new man knocks on the door .
He ’s brought a maid with him .
“ We ’ll make this a home again , but it ’s going to take a while , ” he says .
“ Ophelia here ca n’t do it by herself , though , so we ’ve brought another mop , bucket and scrub brush so you can help clean up your mess .
Yes , relief is on the way !
“ Watch for the new card in your mailbox .
It ’ll include the next payment to your housesitters . ”

Short Answer Questions
1. Country A can produce 100 units of corn or 200 units of shoes .
Country B can produce 200 units of corn and 400 units of shoes .
Who has a comparative advantage in producing shoes ?
Show your work , and explain your answer .
Neither country has a comparative advantage in corn or shoes because their opportunity costs are the same for each good .
See the calculations ( and comparisons ) below .
The opportunity cost in A of producing corn is 2 units of shoes ( i.e. 200/100 )
The opportunity cost in B of producing corn is 2 units of shoes ( i.e. 400/200 )
The opportunity cost in A of producing shoes is a 1/2 unit of shoes ( i.e. 100/200 )
The opportunity cost in B of producing shoes is a 1/2 unit of shoes ( i.e. 200/400 )
Questions # 2 and 3 use the following information :
The demand and supply curves below describe the U.S. market for sequined , white Elvis shirts .
Demand : P = 100 - 2Q d Supply : P = 20 + 8Q s
Set Demand equal to Supply ( and drop the subscripts for now ) :
100 - 2Q = 20 + 8Q
Q* = 8
P = 100 - 2 ( 8 ) = $ 84
3 . What effect does a $ 60 price ceiling have on this market ?
In your answer , state the amount of any surplus or shortage ( and show your work ) .
Since the price ceiling is set below the equilibrium price of $ 84 , it will cause a shortage ( of 15 units ) .
When producers must charge the price ceiling price of $ 60 , then we can determine their output ( quantity supplied ) by looking at the supply curve .
To find Q s , set the Supply equation equal to $ 60 and solve for Q s :
$ 60 = 20 + 8Q s
Q s = 5
To find out how much people want to buy at a price of $ 60 , set the Demand equation equal to $ 60 also , and solve for Q d :
$ 60 = 100 - 2Q d
Q d = 20
Any shortage is measured as the difference between quantity demanded and quantity supplied : Q d - Q s = 20 - 5 = 15 .
Use the following stock information ( taken from the Wall Street Journal ) as you would have seen it when completing the second homework assignment from class .
4. Noting how the ( final ) price and quantity of each stock changes from day to day , state whether each stock is experiencing a decrease in demand , increase in demand , decrease in supply or increase in supply .
a. IBM
( close ) Price decreased and ( Vol ) quantity increased , which implies an increase in supply
b. PepsiCo
Price decreased and quantity decreased , which implies a decrease in demand
c. Coca Cola Ent .
Price increased and quantity increased , which implies an increase in demand
d. Gen Motors
Price decreased and quantity decreased , which implies a decrease in demand
( for part d , on Version A , some people noticed that Net Chg shows a price increase , so I tried to give the appropriate credit to people -- if they pointed this out )
Worried the federal government is increasing its dominance over their affairs , several states are pursuing legislative action to assert their sovereignty under the 10th Amendment of the Constitution in hopes of warding off demands from Washington on how to spend money or enact policy .
The growing concerns even have a handful of governors questioning whether to accept federal stimulus money that comes with strings attached .
The sentiments to declare themselves legally independent from Washington have swept across as many as a dozen states , renewing a debate over so - called unfunded mandates that last raged in the 1990s .
The states question whether the U.S. government can force states to take actions without paying for them or impose conditions on states if they accept certain federal funding .
“ We are telling the federal government that we are a sovereign state and want to be treated as such .
We are not a branch of the federal government , ” said Arizona state Rep. Judy Burges , who is leading an effort in her state to pass a resolution called “ Sovereignty : the 10th Amendment . ”
Ms. Burges was inspired to action by a pair of Bush administration initiatives : The No Child Left Behind education law of 2002 and the Real ID Act , a 2005 law that established national standards for state - issued driver ’s licenses and identification cards .
In other states , lawmakers say they are bracing to repeal federal mandates to spend their money that they expect will emanate from Washington once President Obama begins delivering some of the big - ticket programs promised during his presidential campaign .
Oklahoma state Sen. Randy Brogdon introduced a resolution that he said would enable his state to “ reclaim its 10th Amendment right to reject any and all acts of Congress that go beyond its enumerated powers in violation of the 10th Amendment . ”
Other states pursuing sovereignty resolutions are Hawaii , Michigan , Missouri , Montana , New Hampshire and Washington .
Similar measures are likely to be introduced in more than a dozen other states , analysts said .
“ The states are sending a message , ” said Robert Alt , a legal scholar at the Heritage Foundation .
The nearly $ 800 billion stimulus bill also has raised worries .
Republican governors Mark Sanford of South Carolina , Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Rick Perry of Texas expressed reservations this week about accepting their states ’ shares of the stimulus package because they are worried that the federal government will impose conditions on how it can be spent .
As a self - styled staunch conservative , Mr. Sanford , the new head of the Republican Governors Association , aggressively opposed the stimulus plan .
However , in a Thursday morning interview on CBS ’ “ The Early Show , ” Mr. Sanford said his state would accept money from the stimulus bill .
Opposing the plan “ does n’t preclude taking the money , ” said Mr. Sanford .
South Carolina ’s 9.5 percent unemployment rate is the nation ’s third - highest .
Mr. Perry sent Mr. Obama a letter Wednesday certifying that Texas also would accept stimulus money .
“ I remain opposed to using these funds to expand existing government programs , burdening the state with ongoing expenditures long after the funding has dried up , ” Mr. Perry wrote , clearly expressing his opposition to unfunded mandates .
Mr. Obama has promised that his administration will use federal funds to support his administration ’s initiatives .
“ [ Mr. Obama does ] not support imposing unfunded mandates on states and localities .
They strongly support providing necessary funding for programs such as No Child Left Behind , ” his campaign literature said .
The states are resting their efforts on the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution , which states : “ The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . ”
Mr. Brogdon said prospects for passage of his resolution are “ grand , ” noting that a similar bill passed the Oklahoma House by a 97 - 3 vote last year and that Republicans captured a majority of the Oklahoma Senate in the 2008 elections .
He predicted that the Legislature would easily override a veto from Gov. Brad Henry , a Democrat .
Mr. Obama proposed a slew of expensive programs during his presidential campaign , ranging from health insurance to policies addressing alternative energy and climate change .
“ The states are worried that these programs would increase the overall regulatory burden without providing the funding , ” Mr. Alt said .
Some analysts dispute the financial impact of recent unfunded mandates on state budgets .
Tad DeHaven , a budget analyst at the Cato Institute who recently completed a two - year stint in Indiana ’s budget office , said he has n’t “ heard states clamoring about unfunded mandates the way they were during the 1990s .
What you hear more today are states begging for federal money . ”
The reality is that states are being “ hypocritical , ” he said , noting that about a third of average total state spending comes from the federal government .
The biggest federal grants involve Medicaid , the federal - state program that provides health care for the poor .
“ States were adding Medicaid benefits when times were good .
Now the federal government must bail the states out through the so - called stimulus bill because the states ’ revenues have taken a hit and they must operate under a balanced - budget mandate , ” Mr. DeHaven said .
In 2007 , according to the Congressional Budget Office , states collectively spent $ 1 billion for unfunded federal mandates from programs enacted since the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 , said Brian Riedl , a budget analyst at the Heritage Foundation .
“ To a large degree , states are scapegoating their budget problems on Washington , ” Mr. Riedl said .
“ It ’s tough to be sympathetic for states and local governments when they got $ 467 billion in federal grants last year , ” he said .
Mr. Riedl also rejected the notion that the No Child Left Behind Act constitutes an unfunded mandate .
States are free to opt out of this and many other federal programs by not accepting federal money in exchange for federal regulations .
States have effectively decided that the federal dollars are worth the strings attached to them , Mr. Riedl concluded .
Mr. Riedl acknowledged that Medicaid , which was created in 1965 , does represent a major unfunded mandate .
But he said that “ a majority of state Medicaid spending is on populations and benefits that states have voluntarily added and could reduce at any time . ”
The other major unfunded federal mandate that predates the 1995 law is the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( IDEA ) .
However , federal funding for IDEA has grown 71 percent faster than inflation since 2001 , Mr. Riedl said .
Many of the sovereignty resolutions under consideration in the states will not have the force of law .
Even if they did , said Mr. Alt , “ through the supremacy clause in the U.S. Constitution , so long as a federal statute is constitutional , it would trump state law . ”
Mr. Brogdon of Oklahoma did not take issue with that .
“ Federal law does not trump the Constitution , ” he said .
He suggested that if he becomes governor , the federal courts likely will get a case involving the 10th Amendment and congressional powers .

The economic slowdown is hurting everyone , but if you are a chip company with deep pockets , the recession can be your friend .
Intel announced Tuesday that it plans to accelerate its production of 32 - nanometer processors and cancel some of its 45 - nm integrated graphic chips in a bid to increase its lead over rival AMD .
At the same time , Intel is cutting prices , betting the move will coax reluctant consumers to open their wallets .
The two moves are a one - two punch that AMD , whose annual revenues are one - sixth of Intel 's , will have a hard time matching .
" It 's a form of stimulus package for the worldwide demand for processors , " says Shane Rau , an analyst with research firm IDC .
" Intel is showing that it can invest through the downturn and be ready when the demand returns . "
Intel is reportedly cutting prices up to 40 percent on its older processors , a move that many have interpreted as a sign of economic pressure .
That 's just one part of the strategy , say Intel executives , touting the chip giant 's plans to invest $ 7 billion to upgrade its 32 - nm–chip manufacturing facilities in the United States .
And it has accelerated its schedule to have those chips for notebooks and desktops in production in the fourth quarter of the year , says
Steve Smith , vice president at Intel .
Worldwide microprocessor shipments fell significantly in the fourth quarter and are likely to decline further in the first half of this year , says IDC .
Intel has felt the pain .
In January , the company said it will close fourassembly and test facilities internationally and lay off about 6,000 people .
But analysts such as Rau see those announcements as Intel 's short - term reaction to slowing demand .
Intel 's long - term bet is its decision to scrap its 45 - nm processors with integrated graphics , codenamed Havendale and Auburndale , in favor of more - advanced and faster 32 - nm processors .
Intel started shipping its 45 - nm chips more than a year ago .
In November the company said it is set to release a desktop version of the 45 - nm chip called Core i7 .
Now Smith says Intel has " de- prioritized " the 45 - nm technology family and will instead focus on 32 - nm products , whose family codename will be Westmere .
The first 32 - nm chips will be in production later this year , including the dual - core chips codenamed Clarkdale and
Arrandale .
Intel also plans to have 32 - nm quad - core chips ( Lynnfield ) next year .
" We are hoping consumers will be motivated to buy these , " says Smith .
" It is good products that lead us out of the recession . "
AMD wo n't have a desktop chip comparable to the 45 - nm Core i7 until next year , and its 32 - nm chips are not expected until 2011 .
" By transitioning to 32 nm aggressively Intel is pressing its advantage competitively , " says IDC 's Rau .
" Now instead of competing against AMD or others , Intel is effectively competing against itself and the market forces . "

Statement to this website
7/23/07 : " In May 2006 , I was watching Glenn Beck ’s show on CNN .
The Department of Defense had just released the infamous " 5 frames " of stop-action video of the pentagon attack .
Beck showed the frames and commented , " You can see a 757 in 10 seconds flat !
Either that or a naked Michael Moore heading for the buffet !
This should put all those conspiracy theories to rest " .
While watching it , I 'm thinking to myself , " I ca n’t see any 757 . ”
And I 'm asking myself , “ Are there still unresolved questions regarding 9/11 ? "
So I started poking around on the Internet trying to find anything I can to back up the government ’s story because I did n't want to believe our government might have had something to do with 9/11 .
Early on , I came across Operation Northwoods .
It blew me away that elements of our government had seriously planned acts of terrorism inside the United States to justify invading Cuba .
Consider that 9/11 Commission Chairman Thomas Kean had said , " The greatest failure of 9/11 was lack of imagination " , yet just under 40 years prior , elements of our own government imagined perpetrating such an event !
In late summer of 2006 , I co-founded the group Pilots for 9/11 Truth , to more formally conduct research on the aviation - related aspects of 9/11 .
In August 2006 , Pilots for 9/11 Truth received from the National Transportation and Safety Board ( NTSB ) a copy of the Flight Data Recorder data of Flight 77 , which , according to the official account , hit the Pentagon .
We analyzed the data and announced our conclusion on 3/26/07 that " The information provided by the NTSB does not support the 9/11 Commission Report of American Airlines Flight 77 impact with the Pentagon . "
Much more information about this can be found in our video documentary and our press release .
So now , a year after I began looking into the events of 9/11 and having devoted a lot of time and effort researching those events , I 'm frustrated because we have n't been able to find anything to confirm the government 's story .
And what 's worse is that the FBI and NTSB refuse to even discuss with us the many obvious problems we found in the Flight 77 Flight Data Recorder .
I continue to work with my colleagues at Pilots for 9/11 Truth , to grow the organization and to continue our research into the aviation - related aspects of 9/11 , looking for confirmation of the government ’s story . "

Audio interview by Mike Chambers 2/6/07 : " I just recently -- quote , unquote -- woke up back in May [ 2006 ] due to a video that I saw on mainstream media telling me that I could see a 757 in ten seconds flat going across the Pentagon lawn .
And from there I did my research and here I am now ... with Pilotsfor911 Truth.org .
When I started my research I said to myself , I am going to do everything in my power to figure out and back up the official story , the government 's story -- the government fairy tale , I now call it -- so I can have faith and believe in my government .
We have gotten to the point where I have n't been able to find anything to confirm the government 's story .
Now , we received the flight data information through the NTSB back in August [ 2006 ] .
...
The files that we originally received from the NTSB shows the aircraft too high to have hit the light poles .
They can see that on Pilotsfor911 Truth.org Full Analysis .
And of course in our film Pandora 's Black Box Chapter 2 . ...
The flight data recorder raw file that we have just decoded ... it 's still showing too high for the Pentagon .
...
It shows the radar altimeter at 273 feet .
That means 273 feet above the ground .
OK ?
The Pentagon only gets up to 77 feet . "

2/15/06 : " I most certainly and honestly believe , that sometime in the near future , it will become common knowledge that the events of 9/11 were an " inside job " designed , engineered and committed by a very large and " in control " rogue element within our United States federal government , used as a false cause , a pretext , a lie , to invade two natural resource rich foreign countries , to further pursue and expand an empire , to change the borders of the Middle East countries , and as part of the war on terror , or more appropriately , the war on freedom , was used to frighten the American people so they would allow the infringement of their civil liberties and constitutional rights , to allow for closer monitoring and further oppression .

Audio interview with Rob Balsamo
3/9/07 : Regarding the Flight Data Recorder information for Flight 77 , which allegedly hit the Pentagon , released by the NTSB
John Lear :
There 's a lot things in that tape that came up , that if you 're a pilot , you say , " Hey , wait a minute .
That 's bull ****.
That could never happen in a million years . " ...
Rob Balsamo :
What did you think about 9/11 after you saw it ?
John Lear :
Well , you know , five minutes after it happened , I knew that it was a scam .
... No Boeing 757 ever crashed into the Pentagon .
No Boeing 757 ever crashed at Shanksville .
...
And no Arab hijacker , ever in a million years , ever flew into the World Trade Center .
And if you got 30 minutes I 'll tell you exactly why he could n't do it the first time .
Now , I 'd have trouble doing it the first time .
Rob Balsamo : Yeah , same here .
John Lear : Maybe if I had a couple tries to line up a few building , I could have done it .
But certainly not the first time and certainly not at 500 or 600 miles an hour .
Rob Balsamo : Yeah , as a matter of fact , one of our members , he was a 737 Check Airman .
He was in the sim at the time on September 11 and right after it happened they tried to duplicate it in the simulator and they said they could n't do it .
They were trying to hit the Towers and they could n't do it .
...
John Lear : Yeah , it would be an amazing feat of airmanship .
...
John Lear : People ask , you know , why do I think that 9/11 was a scam .
They say , " Why would the government do that ? "
And I said , there 's three basic reasons .
Number 1 ; they wanted to take away all our liberties and they had to pose a threat to do that .
Number 2 ; they wanted a reason to go into Afghanistan .
...
Then the third thing was we had to have a pretext for going into Iraq .

... John Lear : Yeah , it would be an amazing feat of airmanship .
... John Lear : People ask , you know , why do I think that 9/11 was a scam .
They say , " Why would the government do that ? "
And I said , there 's three basic reasons .
Number 1 ; they wanted to take away all our liberties and they had to pose a threat to do that .
Number 2 ; they wanted a reason to go into Afghanistan .
...
Then the third thing was we had to have a pretext for going into Iraq .

Former U.S. Air Force fighter pilot with over 100 combat missions .
Video interview 9/11 Ripple Effect 8/07 : " I flew the two actual aircraft which were involved in 9/11 ; the Fight number 175 and Flight 93 , the 757 that allegedly went down in Shanksville and Flight 175 is the aircraft that 's alleged to have hit the South Tower .
I do n't believe it 's possible for , like I said , for a terrorist , a so - called terrorist to train on a [ Cessna ] 172 , then jump in a cockpit of a 757 - 767 class cockpit , and vertical navigate the aircraft , lateral navigate the aircraft , and fly the airplane at speeds exceeding it 's design limit speed by well over 100 knots , make high - speed high - banked turns , exceeding -- pulling probably 5 , 6 , 7 G's .
And the aircraft would literally fall out of the sky .
I could n't do it and I 'm absolutely positive they could n't do it . "

Article 7/17/05 : " The government story they handed us about 9/11 is total B.S. plain and simple . " …
Wittenberg convincingly argued there was absolutely no possibility that Flight 77 could have " descended 7,000 feet in two minutes , all the while performing a steep 280 degree banked turn before crashing into the Pentagon 's first floor wall without touching the lawn . " …
" For a guy to just jump into the cockpit and fly like an ace is impossible - there is not one chance in a thousand , " said Wittenberg , recalling that when he made the jump from Boeing 727's to the highly sophisticated computerized characteristics of the 737's through 767's it took him considerable time to feel comfortable flying .

Audio Interview 9/16/04 : Regarding Flight 77 , which allegedly hit the Pentagon .
" The airplane could not have flown at those speeds which they said it did without going into what they call a high speed stall .
The airplane wo n’t go that fast if you start pulling those high G maneuvers at those bank angles . …
To expect this alleged airplane to run these maneuvers with a total amateur at the controls is simply ludicrous ...
It ’s roughly a 100 ton airplane .
And an airplane that weighs 100 tons all assembled is still going to have 100 tons of disassembled trash and parts after it hits a building .
There was no wreckage from a 757 at the Pentagon . …
The vehicle that hit the Pentagon was not Flight 77 .
We think , as you may have heard before , it was a cruise missile . "

Statement to this website
8/20/07 : " I started questioning the Sept 11 , 2001 “ story ” only days after the event .
It just did n't make any sense to me .
How could a steel and concrete building collapse after being hit by a Boeing 767 ?
Did n't the engineers design it to withstand a direct hit from a Boeing 707 , approximately the same size and weight of the 767 ?
The evidence just did n't add up .
...
At the Pentagon , the pilot of the Boeing 757 did quite a feat of flying .
I have 6,000 hours of flight time in Boeing 757’s and 767’s and could not have flown it the way the flight path was described .
I was also a Navy fighter pilot and Air Combat Instructor , U.S. Navy Fighter Weapons School and have experience flying low altitude , high speed aircraft .
I could not have done what these beginners did .
Something stinks to high heaven !
Where is the damage to the wall of the Pentagon from the wings ?
Where are the big pieces that always break away in an accident ?
Where is all the luggage ?
Where are the miles and miles of wire , cable , and lines that are part and parcel of any large aircraft ?
Where are the steel engine parts ?
Where is the steel landing gear ?
Where is the tail section that would have broken into large pieces ?
I also personally knew American Airlines Captain “ Chick ” Burlingame , who was the captain of Flight 77 which allegedly hit the Pentagon , and I know he would not have given up his airplane to crazies !
And at the Shanksville Pennsylvania impact site , where is any of the wreckage ?!!!
Of all the pictures I have seen , there is only a hole !
Where is any piece of a crashed airplane ?
Why was the area cordoned off , and no inspection allowed by the normal accident personnel ?
Where is any evidence at all ?
When one starts using his own mind , and not what one was told , there is very little to believe in the official “ story ” .
...
Every question leads to another question that has not been answered by anyone in authority .
This is just the beginning as to why I do n’t believe the official “ story ” and why I want the truth to be told . "

Essay Debunking the Debunkers 2/14/05 : " For over a decade now , the PTB [ Powers That Be ] have used an odd vehicle to do their debunking on a variety of issues - Popular Mechanics Magazine ( a Hearst publication ) .

In the March 2005 issue , PM magazine singled out 16 issues or claims of the 9/11 skeptics that point to government collusion and systematically attempted to debunk each one .
Of the 16 , most missed the mark and almost half were straw men arguments - either ridiculous arguments that few conspiracists believed or restatements of the arguments that were highly distorted so as to make them look weaker than they really were .

I am one of those who claim there are factual arguments pointing to conspiracy , and that truth is not served by taking cheap shots at those who see gaping flaws in the government story ...
There is significant evidence that the aircraft impacts did not cause the collapse [ of the Twin Towers ] ...
The issues of the penetration hole [ at the Pentagon ] and the lack of large pieces of debris simply do not jive with the official story , but they are explainable if you include the parking lot video evidence that shows a huge white explosion at impact .
This cannot happen with an aircraft laden only with fuel .
It can only happen in the presence of high explosives . "

Audio interview with Rob Balsamo
6/25/07 : Regarding the 9/11 Commission 's account of the impact of Flight 77 at the Pentagon and discrepancies with the actual Flight Data Recorder information :
" After I did my own analysis of it , it 's obvious that there 's discrepancies between the two stories ; between the 9/11 Commission and the flight data recorder information .
And I think that 's where we really need to focus a lot of our attention to get the help that we need in order to put pressure on government agencies to actually do a real investigation of 9/11 .
And not just from a security standpoint , but from even an aviation standpoint , like any accident investigation would actually help the aviators out by finding reasons for things happening .
...
The things that really got my attention were the amount of descent rate that you had to have at the end of the flight , of Flight 77 , that would have made it practically impossible to hit the light poles .
[ Editor 's note : Destruction of the light poles near the Pentagon by Flight 77 was stated in the 9/11 Commission Report . ]
Essentially it would have been too high at that point to the point of impact where the main body of the airplane was hitting between the first and second floor of the Pentagon .
...
You know , I 'd ride my bike to the Pentagon .
So , you know I 'm a little bit familiar with that area .
[ Editor 's note : Lt. Col. Latas served as a Weapons Requirement Officer at the Pentagon . ]
But , you know , that kind of descent rate it would have been impossible essentially for the results that we see physically from what the flight data recorder was recording .
Like I say , that 's an area that I think deserves explanation .
...
The ground track [ the path of the airplane ] is off from the 9/11 Commission .
There are several things that can be brought up but it 's been a while since I 've seen the film and looked at the flight data recorder .
And I can't think of all the discrepancies I saw , but there are several there .
[ The film he refers to is the video documentary , Pandora 's Black Box , Chapter 2 , Flight of American 77 . ] ...
And I think that we Americans need to demand further investigation just to clarify the discrepancies that you 've [ Pilots for 9/11 Truth ] found .
And I think that we need to be getting on the phone with our Congressmen and women and letting them know that we do n't accept the excuses that we 're hearing now , that we want true investigators to do a true investigation . "

Interview Alex Jones Show 4/11/07 :
Alex Jones : Recap Hani Hanjour 's maneuver , what they claim -- go through the maneuver they claim he did and then what supposedly happened there at the Pentagon ...
Commander Muga :
The maneuver at the Pentagon was just a tight spiral coming down out of 7,000 feet .
And a commercial aircraft , while they can in fact structurally somewhat handle that maneuver , they are very , very , very difficult .
And it would take considerable training .
In other words , commercial aircraft are designed for a particular purpose and that is for comfort and for passengers and it's not for military maneuvers .
And while they are structurally capable of doing them , it takes some very , very talented pilots to do that .
...
When a commercial airplane gets that high , it gets very , very close to getting into what you refer to as a speed high - speed stall .
And a high - speed stall can be very , very violent on a commercial - type aircraft and you never want to get into that situation .
I just can't imagine an amateur even being able to come close to performing a maneuver of that nature .
And as far as hijacking the airplanes , once again getting back to the nature of pilots and airplanes , there is no way that a pilot would give up an airplane to hijackers .
...
I mean , hell , a guy does n't give up a TV remote control much less a complicated 757 .
And so to think that pilots would allow a plane to be taken over by a couple of 5 foot 7 , 150 pound guys with a one - inch blade boxcutter is ridiculous .
And also in all four planes , if you remember , none of the planes ever switched on their transponder to the hijack code .
There 's a very , very simple code that you put in if you suspect that your plane is being hijacked .
It takes literally just a split - second for you to put your hand down on the center console and flip it over .
And not one of the four planes ever transponded a hijack code , which is most , most unusual .
...
Commercial airplanes are very , very complex pieces of machines .
And they 're designed for two pilots up there , not just two amateur pilots , but two qualified commercial pilots up there .
And to think that you 're going to get an amateur up into the cockpit and fly , much less navigate , it to a designated target , the probability is so low , that it 's bordering on impossible . "

Ralph W. Omholt – Commercial airline pilot .
Aircraft flown : Boeing 727 , 737 , 747 , 757 , 767 , and McDonnell Douglas DC - 10 .
Statement : " Almost nothing in the " official " 9 - 11 account proves to be factual .
For all the purported U.S. failures ; no one was punished - most were rewarded .
At the 9 - 11 Pentagon , the world witnessed a fire and suggestions of explosions .
Airport fire trucks rushed to the scene of a purported “ crash ” site - without discovering an airplane .
There is no viable evidence of burning jet fuel .
Just the statement , " They say it was an airplane . "
The pre-collapse Pentagon section showed no ‘ forward - moving ’ damage .
The damage is at the wrong location .
The expected “ crash ” damage does n't exist .
There was no particular physical evidence of the expected " wreckage . "
There was no tail , no wings ; no damage consistent with a B - 757 “ crash . ”
Even the Pentagon lawn was undamaged !
The geometry of the day certifies the ‘ official ’ account as a blatant lie .
The few aircraft parts discovered at the Pentagon are highly suspect .
The dramatic " witness " accounts lack supporting physical evidence - with the exception of those who described the incredibly few aircraft parts .
All images show that the building was n't aggressively searched for survivors .
Lacking any ' expected ' clues , one is left to ask " Who said this was an airplane crash , in the first place ? "
The purported Flight 93 crash site in Pennsylvania is quite similar .
Since 9 - 11 , it was discovered that there was no expected Air Force fighter response .
By all appearances , the expected fighters were held back from interfering with ; or witnessing the unfolding events .
The fighter onboard electronics would have not only offered an intercept target , but would have displayed and recorded the forbidden reality of the day .
Of particular interest would be the fate of two obviously missing airliners .
The alleged hijackers apparently were not on board the aircraft !
Their names were not on any passenger manifests - yet shown .
The ‘ names ’ of at least seven of the alleged hijackers were discovered to be still alive - with no questions being asked about whom the real hijackers were .
No attempt has been made to discover the “ known terrorists . ”
There were at least four hijackers – all evidence pointing to their being highly qualified jet pilots - not zealous Arab wannabes .
As the names of “ al Qaeda ” and “ bin Laden ” continue to be pandered in the shadows of ‘ terrorism , ' journalists continue to discover that the bin Laden family was given the treatment of royalty , immediately following 9 - 11 .
...
The legacy of 9 - 11 is that America - and its Constitution - is far more threatened from the White House , than the caves of Afghanistan . "

Dennis Cimino – Commercial pilot rating for over 25 years .
Systems Engineer .
Navy Combat Systems Specialist ( Radar , ECM , UHF / VHF / HF COMMS . , GPS , INS , SATNAV , cryptographic communications ) .
Millimeter wave RADAR and countermeasures expert since 1973 .
Two patents held for Doppler RADAR .
Former Flight Data Recorder Engineer , Smiths Aerospace .
Statement to this website 6/3/07 : " I have been a licensed pilot with a commercial rating , multi-engine , IFR , since 1981 .
Prior to that I served as an Electronic Warfare / Electronic Signals Intelligence ( EW ELINT ) specialist in the U.S. Navy , with many ' first time ' signal intercepts in the national ( NSA ) sigint database .
Since I left the Navy in 1979 , I have been heavily involved in DoD weapons system testing and certification .
I have held high level clearances most of my career .
There is no doubt in my mind that what transpired on September 11 , 2001 , was an inside job carried out by members of our own government .
Based on my experience as a commercial pilot , I do not believe that it 's possible for four large commercial airliners to have gone off course for as long as they did and as far as they did and were not intercepted by Air Force pilots , without the explicit cooperation of highly placed people in the military and government .
I also do not believe that both of the WTC Twin Towers could have been identically pulverized and that both identically collapsed into their own footprints as a result of a single airplane impact and the fire from a few thousand gallons of jet fuel .
I also do not believe that WTC Building 7 , which was n't even hit by an airplane , could have entirely collapsed as a result of a few fires , particularly in a manner that is entirely consistent with a controlled demolition .
Additionally , the visible evidence at the Pentagon is inconsistent with an impact by a Boeing 757 .
There was virtually no debris from the 80 - ton airplane , except a few small pieces that were picked up by hand .
Nor was there any evidence of holes in the building that surely would have resulted from the impacts of the two 6 - ton RB - 211 engines on the alleged Boeing 757 .
Similarly , at Shanksville , PA , the small gash in the earth is far too small to have resulted from the impact of a Boeing 757 .
All of these factors have convinced me that our government was fully onboard with what took place on 9/11 .
The official account of 9/11 is absolute B.S. We , as citizens of this great country , need to do research , question the government , and demand a full , impartial investigation to determine what actually took place that day . "

Editor 's note : WTC Building 7 was 610 feet tall , 47 stories .
It would have been the tallest building in 33 states .
Although it was not hit by an airplane , it completely collapsed into a pile of rubble in less than 7 seconds at 5:20 p.m. on 9/11 , seven hours after the collapses of the Twin Towers .
However , no mention of its collapse appears in the 9/11 Commission 's " full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . "
Watch the collapse video here .
And six years after 9/11 , the Federal government has yet to publish its promised final report that explains the cause of its collapse .

FAA certified commercial pilot .
FAA certified Flight Instructor and certified Ground Instructor .
After leaving the FAA , he had a 12 - year career in the field of comedy ending up as artistic coordinator for " Catch A Rising Star " in Harvard Square in Cambridge , MA .
Statement to this website
4/10/07 : " I knew within hours of the attacks on 9/11/2001 that it was an inside job .
Based on my 11 - year experience as an FAA Air Traffic Controller in the busy Northeast corridor , including hundreds of hours of training , briefings , air refuelings , low altitude bombing drills , being part of huge military exercises , daily military training exercises , interacting on a routine basis directly with NORAD radar personnel , and based on my own direct experience dealing with in - flight emergency situations , including two instances of hijacked commercial airliners , I state unequivocally ;
There is absolutely no way that four large commercial airliners could have flown around off course for 30 to 60 minutes on 9/11 without being intercepted and shot completely out of the sky by our jet fighters unless very highly placed people in our government and our military wanted it to happen .
It is important for people to understand that scrambling jet fighters to intercept aircraft showing the signs of experiencing " IN - FLIGHT EMERGENCIES " such as going off course without authorization , losing a transponder signal and / or losing radio contact is a common and routine task executed jointly between the FAA and NORAD controllers .
The entire " national defense - first responder " intercept system has many highly - trained civilian and military personnel who are committed and well - trained to this task .
FAA and NORAD continuously monitor our skies and fighter planes and pilots are on the ready 24/ 7 to handle these situations .
Jet fighters typically intercept any suspect plane over the United States within 10 - 15 minutes of notification of a problem .
This type of " immediate , high speed , high priority and emergency " scramble had been happening regularly approximately 75 - 150 times per year for ten years .
...
I believe that 9/11 was what is known as a " False Flag Operation " in which a country inflicts casualties upon itself , and then blames it on an enemy that they want to go to war against .
It is one more instance in the United States ’ long history of using " False Flag Operations " and blatant propaganda to ramp - up hostile emotions towards an enemy in a population otherwise resistant to going to war . "

Article 3/12/07 : " When it became clear that there had n't been a systems failure of any kind on the morning of September 11th , Hordon was certain that something had gone terribly wrong within the upper echelons of authority .
A pilot ( third level air carrier ) as well as an ATC , he is well versed on in - flight emergency protocol .
He is also adamant that if these procedures had been followed on 9/11 not one of the hijacked planes would have reached their targets .
" I 'm sorry but American 11 should have been intercepted over southwest Connecticut — bang , done deal . " ...
The unfathomable delays seen in military action on 9/11 are inconceivable to those who have painstakingly investigated the matter -- and for a man who worked for years keeping air travel over the U.S. safe .
...
" I think we all have to agree that , one way or another , the U.S. military was involved in the attacks .
The advantage that Rumsfeld had is that he can classify , reshape , make available , make unavailable any information that he wants , at any time and deny that information to the public for any reason , especially national security . "

Doug Brinkman :
What was the one point about 9/11 that really convinced you that the official story just does n't hold water ?
Bruce Sinclair :
Well , the one I use for people who are 9/11 neophytes or people who are disbelievers is --
The single most compelling piece of evidence is the collapse of Building 7 at the World Trade Center .
Most people do n't even know that Building 7 collapsed because it 's been expunged from the mainstream media completely .
But the bottom line is that when a 47 - story steel and concrete structure falls at 5:30 in the afternoon at 6 and a half seconds of free - fall speed into its own shadow , with video tapes of people saying " You 'll have to get back .
The building is coming down . " --
Videos which I 've seen .
Another one which has actually people videotaped doing a countdown before the building is destroyed .
This is the prima facie proof of an inside job .
This building was hit by no airplane .

The US and its European allies are ­preparing to plant a high - profile figure in the heart of the Kabul government in a direct challenge to the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , the Guardian has learned .
The creation of a new chief executive or prime ministerial role is aimed at bypassing Karzai .
In a further dilution of his power , it is proposed that money be diverted from the Kabul government to the provinces .
Many US and European officials have become disillusioned with the extent of the corruption and incompetence in the Karzai government , but most now believe there are no credible alternatives , and predict the Afghan president will win re-election in August .
A revised role for Karzai has emerged from the White House review of Afghanistan and Pakistan ordered by Barack Obama when he became president .
It isto be unveiled at a special conference on Afghanistan at The Hague on March 31 .
As well as watering down Karzai 's personal authority by installing a senior official at the president 's side capable of playing a more efficient executive role , the US and Europeans are seeking to channel resources to the provinces rather than to central government in Kabul .
A diplomat with knowledge of the review said : " Karzai is not delivering .
If we are going to support his government , it has to be run properly to ensure the levels of corruption decrease , not increase .
The levels of corruption are frightening . "
Another diplomat said alternatives to Karzai had been explored and discarded : " No one could be sure that someone else would not turn out to be 10 times worse .
It is not a great position . "
The idea of a more dependable figure working alongside Karzai is one of the proposals to emerge from the White House review , completed last week .
Obama , locked away at the presidental retreat Camp David , was due to make a final decision this weekend .
Obama is expected to focus in public on overall strategy rather than the details , and , given its sensitivity , to skate over ­Karzai 's new role .
The main recommendation is for the Afghanistan objectives to be scaled back , and for Obama to sell the war to the US public as one to ensure the country cannot again be a base for al - Qaida and the Taliban , rather than the more ambitious aim of the Bush administration of trying to create a European - style democracy in Central Asia .
Other recommendations include : increasing the number of Afghan troops from 65,000 to 230,000 as well as expanding the 80,000 - strong police force ; ­sending more US and European civilians to build up Afghanistan 's infrastructure ; and increased aid to Pakistan as part of a policy of trying to persuade it to tackle al - Qaida and Taliban elements .
The proposal for an alternative chief executive , which originated with the US , is backed by Europeans .
" There needs to be a deconcentration of power , " said one senior European official .
" We need someone next to Karzai , a sort of chief executive , who can get things done , who will be reliable for us and accountable to the Afghan people . "
Money and power will flow less to the ministries in Kabul and far more to the officials who run Afghanistan outside the capital – the 34 provincial governors and 396 district governors .
" The point on which we insist is that the time is now for a new division of responsibilities , between central power and local power , " the senior European official said .
No names have emerged for the new role but the US holds in high regard the reformist interior minister appointed in October , Mohammed Hanif Atmar .
The risk for the US is that the imposition of a technocrat alongside Karzai would be viewed as colonialism , even though that figure would be an Afghan .
Karzai declared his intention last week to resist a dilution of his power .
Last week he accused an unnamed foreign government of trying to weaken central government in Kabul .
" That is not their job , " the Afghan president said .
" Afghanistan will never be a puppet state . "
The UK government has since 2007 advocated dropping plans to turn Afghanistan into a model , European - style state .
Richard Holbrooke , the US envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan , who will implement the new policy , said it would represent a " vastly restructured effort " .
At the weekend in Brussels , he was scathing about the Bush administration 's conduct of the counter - insurgency .
" The failures in the civilian side ... are so enormous we can at least hope that if we get our act together ... we can do a lot better , " he said .
Gawker has some questions for Jesse B. Watters , the Fox News producer that Bill O'Reilly likes to send out to ambush his enemies .
So we 're outside his building in Long Island .
Right now .
( Hi , Jesse ! )
This apartment building is the last known address for both him and his wife according to publicly accessible databases .
( And because some of you thought the original photo was a Google Street View snap , here 's a fresh pic . )
We 've got a video camera , and we 'll let you know if we find him .
[ Update : Watters appears to have eluded us ... for now . ]
Watters , as you may have read , likes to sneak up on people without warning and ask them questions so that O'Reilly can air video of his enemies looking aggrieved and flustered .
He 's done it to the New Yorker 's Hendrik Hertzberg , the Washington Post 's William Arkin , Think Progress ' Amanda Terkel , and others .
Watters tailed Arkin for an hour - and - a - half , from Vermont to Massachusetts , and attempted to interview him in front of his children ( Fox , always gracious , digitally obscured their faces ) .
He famously followed Terkel , who is a rather slight young woman , for two hours from Washington , D.C. , to rural Virginia on a weekend getaway .
In all of the above cases , Watters ' intent was to question his targets about things they had said or written .
More recently , Watters attended a GE shareholders ' conference under the pretense that he owned shares of the company .
During a question - and - answer session , he asked GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt about MSNBC 's political leanings , and accused the network of airing hateful speech .
He failed to announce himself as a Fox News employee and secretly recorded the exchange so that O'Reilly could broadcast it as evidence of a shareholders ' " uprising " against Immelt .
In a recent New York Times story , Fox attempted justify its tactics by saying that it invited the targets to appear on O'Reilly 's program , and that they had declined .
Since O'Reilly 's desire was to force them to defend their ideas to him , the only other option was to seek them out , without warning , at their homes or public places .
As Watters put it in a billoreilly .com blog post quoted by the Times : " If they do n't come to us , we 'll go to them . "
This is , at least in the case of Terkel and Hertzberg , a lie : Neither of them received an invitation to go on the program before Watters showed up with his camera .
The Times quoted Watters ' blog post because it could n't speak to him directly : " The Fox News producer responsible for most of the ambush interviews , Jesse Watters , refused repeated interview requests , " the paper wrote .
We found it odd that Watters would refuse to talk to a reporter , given the lengths to which he goes to compel others speak to him .
And as you can hear in this audio , unlike Watters ' typical m.o. , we called him to ask him about it yesterday .
He transferred us immediately to Fox News spokeswoman Irena Briganti , for whom we left a message .
Later yesterday , Briganti called us back .
When we informed her that we were recording the conversation , she refused to talk .
( Incidentally , that 's Fox News ' Roger Ailes pictured , because we could n't find a picture of Briganti . )
Later , via email , Briganti indicated that Watters refused our interview request .
So we decided to track him down and ask him about his ambush interview tactics face - to - face .
If we find him , we 'll post the video as soon as we can .
If we do n't , we 'll keep trying , and for that we 'll need your help .
What do you know about Jesse Watters ?
Did you go to college with him ?
Do you ride the train with him ?
Do you work at the Starbucks where he buys his coffee ?
Let us know .
We 'll get you started :
Watters was born in July 1978 .
He was raised in Philadelphia , graduated from Trinity College in Hartford , Conn. , in 2001 , and has been a producer for the O'Reilly Factor since 2003 .
Before that , he spent about four months in 2002 working on federal judge Dora Irizarry 's losing campaign for New York Attorney General ( making less than $ 12,000 per year ) .
He is married to Noelle Watters — maiden name Inguagiato — who works at Fox News as well , as the host of something called iMag Style on Foxnews.com .
They live together in Manhasset , N.Y .
If you see him , snap a camera phone picture and send it to us .
Or better yet , ask him why he stalks and ambushes people that his boss disagrees with , and tell us what he says .
Two years ago , during an on - air celebration of Watters ' ambushes , O'Reilly had this to say about his young charge : " Jesse Watters , everybody .
He 's becoming a big star all over the world . "
Let 's make that happen .
This evening I had a great chat with a guy named David .
He ’s a 9th grade science teacher in Minnesota .
He ’s working on a project called Growing Communities Of Scientists in his school .
He plans to use a set of “ computer enabled science classrooms ” which embed thin clients into a student group workspace .
David ’s also got a great blog where he ’s been journalling his experience .
This means students have access to computers without interfering with they ’re normal learning / social area .
A common sight I ’ve seen in most computer labs is individual students with hardly any working space and fairly isolated from each other and the instructor .
It ’s sort of like a cubicle effect .
For sciences were you ’re trying to get a lot of hands on instruction it ’s rather difficult .
So , back to Edubuntu .
While David ’s been working on the hardware of his computer enabled science classroom he ’s also been working on getting LTSP set up along with Ubuntu / Edubuntu software he needs to manage his classroom and teach his students .
He ’s run up against a problem that is fairly common to educators but is pretty difficult to work with on Linux systems .
Simply , he needs to control access to applications .
He wants to implement a rewards system where students gain computer privileges ( getting to use Firefox , etc. ) based on being responsible with current privileges .
One of the things that ’s great about Linux OSes is that you can install software system - wide and is supposed to be multi-user friendly .
However , in this case , that freedom is a problem .
I ’d love to hear some suggestions on how to accomplish an application whitelist system in Ubuntu .
OK , but back to the title , why we need Edubuntu to succeed .
The reason I say that is that Ubuntu and Linux / FLOSS in general needs advocates on behalf of students , educators , and the next wave of technolgy users .
People generally tend to stick with the OS they first learn so one of the best ways to make Linux maintstream is to get it into schools .
The problem is that most software development in FLOSS is not centered around education .
There are education - specific applications out there ( Sugar , gcompris , KDE Edu ) for sure , but the OS itself is not always education - friendly .
I ’ve seen a lot of educators trying to deploy LTSP servers in their schools struggle with applications that do n’t behave well with multiple users , even common ones like Firefox and OpenOffice.org .
On top of that key needs such as practical user and group management for educators is almost non-existent .
In many ways , one of the primary jobs of Edubuntu is to provide an advocate for educators and students to Ubuntu and upstream software developers .
It ’s not just about a making a way to install Ubuntu educational software easier , it ’s about it ’s about listening to educational user ’s needs and trying to make some of those dreams reality .
If Ubuntu ca n’t be “ Linux for learning human beings ” I ’m not sure it can really make it mainstream .
I ’ll go out on a limb and say , as we start 2009 , forget the “ Year of the Linux Desktop ” and look towards the “ Year of Linux in Education ” 🙂

The Prius ' chief engineer , Akihiko Otsuka , drove a 33 - mile route in and around Napa and averaged 62.9 mpg .
During the drive week , he levied a Beat - The - Chief challenge to anyone who wanted to take him on .
AutoblogGreen was able to get the in - dash display to read in the mid- to low - 70s for most of the route , but the last ten miles on a busy 55 - mph road dropped that to 64.5 mpg .
Not bad , but only good for a standing near the absolute bottom of the rankings among other journalists .
Overall , the best score was 94.6 mpg , although that involved some less - than - real - world driving behaviors and conditions .
The best " honest " score was 75.3 mpg .
In all , about half of the journalists were able to get over 70 mpg , while the rest , save two , were able to get more than 66 mpg .
Increased fuel economy is one of many ways the 2010 Prius has evolved , but the driving experience is similar to the last generation .
Despite a slightly longer wheelbase , wider track and new low - rolling resistance tires , you do n't notice any serious changes from the driver 's seat .
The front MacPherson struts and improved body rigidity keep the ride smooth around town and on the highway .
Overall , it 's the same commuter - friendly conveyance you 'd expect and , thankfully , rearward visibility is vastly improved over the outgoing model .
However , one small change we did notice was the absence of that infernal beeping when the car is shifted into Reverse that plagued the outgoing model .
After asking Otsuka about the change , we were told that the pre-production models we were testing had the feature removed , but when the production model goes on sale , the beep will return .
The good news ?
Otsuka said dealers can turn off the sound at the customer 's request .
Speaking of current Prius owners , the automaker is convinced they 'll trade up .
In fact , Toyota 's Bob Carter said the company expects 20 - 25 percent of third - generation Prius sales will be repeat buyers .
So where will the other 80 - 85 percent come from ?
It 's clear there 's a hybrid sales fight brewing between Toyota and Honda , and Toyota needs to convince buyers that paying a few thousand dollars more for the Prius over the new Honda Insight is worth it .
The Insight , which starts at $ 20,470 , is smaller and has fewer features than the Prius , but it 's obviously a direct competitor .
Based purely on aerodynamics , the Prius beats the Insight ( 0.25 versus 0.28 Cd ) .
Honda was understandably proud of its " world - leading coefficient " number when the Insight was announced earlier this year , but Toyota has clearly bested its Japanese rival in this department .
Does it matter ?
The Insight is a fun drive that wo n't attack your wallet at the pump or its point of purchase , while the Prius gets better mileage , is larger and comes with a cache of green cred that would fill the Grand Canyon Throw in the new 2010 Ford Fusion Hybrid , which is even larger and starts at $ 27,270 , and 2009 is shaping up to be a good year for potential hybrid owners .
With plug - in vehicles supposedly coming in 2010 ( and pure electric vehicles not long after ) and the poor economy , all bets are off on which hybrid will come out on top .
Still , Toyota polled current Prius owners and 90 % said their next car will be a Prius .
The automaker wanted to offer these repeat buyers some upgraded technology , so it has included two new features on the 2010 Prius : Lane Keep Assist and Intelligent Parking Assist .
Lane Keep Assist ( LKA ) is triggered by pressing a steering wheel - mounted button that turns on the Lane Departure Warning system .
The system looks for yellow and white lines on the pavement and lets the driver know if he or she starts to leave the lane .
Lane Keep Assist is used in conjunction with the Prius ' Dynamic Cruise Control , but it wo n't drive for you .
The system knows if you let go of the wheel and using a turn signal will disengage LKA entirely .
Another fancy feature is Intelligent Parking Assist ( IPA ) , which makes quick work of parallel parking .
When pulling up to an available parking spot , you push a button above the driver 's right knee to activate a sensor that can see where parked cars are sitting .
When the system finishes its calculations , the rear - view camera turns on and displays a grid that estimates the intended parking position .
If the grid is correct , the driver presses " OK " and then the system takes over .
From this point , all the driver does is control the speed of the car using the brake pedal .
If the driver takes his or her foot off of the brake pedal , IPA will shut down when it reaches its speed threshold .
As smart as the new Prius is , however , it 's not smart enough to know if a person suddenly appears in the designated parking spot .
We were able to test IPA , and it works as advertised .
Both LKA and IPA are available as part of the 2010 Prius ' Advanced Technology Package ( pricing TBD ) .
If you think scorpions are scary , just take a look at this guy .
Named Schinderhannes bartelsi , it was found in fossilized form in a German quarry , and dates to 390 million years ago .
That 's about 100 million years after the extinction of the last known animal to sport what 's technically known as a " great appendage " — a giant claw growing out of its head .
But there it is , right between S. bartelsi's eyes : a great appendage .
If great appendage - bearing creatures survived 100 million years longer than we realized , then maybe they did n't die out .
Maybe they evolved — and come to think of it , scorpion claws look an awful lot like great appendages .
But if scorpions are a sign of ancient times , then S. bartelsi's discovery , announced Thursday in Science , contains an unfortunate sign of our own times : with business slumping , the quarry in which it was found has closed .

Social isolation a significant health issue

Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Social isolation a significant health issue 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
You may worry about your waistline or pack - a- day smoking habit , but psychologists say there is a less recognized yet significant health hazard facing Americans : loneliness .
They could have more friends than ever online but , on average , Americans have fewer intimates to confide in than they did a decade ago , according to one study .
Another found that 20 percent of all individuals are , at any given time , unhappy because of social isolation , according to University of Chicago psychologist John Cacioppo .
And , frankly , they 'd rather not talk about it .
" People come into my office and say , ' I 'm depressed or obsessive . '
They do n't say , ' I 'm lonely , ' " said Jacqueline Olds , a psychiatrist who teaches at Harvard Medical School and co-authored " The Lonely American : Drifting Apart in the Twenty - First Century . "
" People are so embarrassed about being lonely that no one admits it .
Loneliness is stigmatized , even though everyone feels it at one time or another . "
Olds wrote the book with her husband , Dr. Richard Schwartz , because , she said , she wanted to bring loneliness " out of the closet . "
The two were struck by findings from the General Social Survey ( conducted by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago ) , showing that people reported having fewer intimate friends in 2004 than they had in 1985 .
When asked how many people they could confide in , the average number declined over that same time period from three to two .
In 2004 , almost a quarter of those surveyed said they had no one to discuss important matters with in the past six months ; in 1985 , only 7 percent were devoid of close confidantes .
" Loneliness has a terrible reputation in this country , " Olds said .
" It 's a problem not just with a few people without social skills .
It 's not synonymous with being a loser . "
Independent , busy people
Why are we growing lonelier ?
Olds said it 's partly due to the American notion of independence that makes people not want to appear needy .
They may feel alone , but they assume neighbors and friends are similarly busy and would n't want to be bothered .
She also points to what she calls " the cult of busyness . "
In an era of frantic pace and multitasking , people feel they should always be accomplishing something .
They work long hours and then , in their limited spare time , they work more - catching up on e-mail , doing the laundry , going to the gym .
Socializing often comes last .
But humans are not wired to live alone , researchers say .
The impulse for social connection - though it is stronger in some people than others - is rooted in the basic urge to survive .
The need is so great , says Cacioppo , that it is reflected in our neural wiring .
Most neuroscientists agree , he said , that it was the need to process social cues that led to the expansion of the cortical mantle of the brain .
In " Loneliness : Human Nature and the Need for Social Connection , " which he co-authored last year , he wrote , " In other words , it was the need to deal with other people that , in large part , made us who and what we are today . "
Loneliness , Cacioppo explained in an interview , has more in common with hunger , thirst and pain than it does with mental illness .
It signals that something is wrong and needs to be corrected .
Study of loneliness
The study of loneliness is n't new .
David Riesman 's " The Lonely Crowd , " published in the early 1950s , raised questions about conformity and individuality following the industrial revolution .
Riesman described how the growing middle class in America was increasingly populated by an emerging personality , which he called the " other - directed , " a type that thrived in the corporate world .
Other - directed people wanted to be well - liked , but formed superficial intimacies .
They were , essentially , living alone in a crowd .
And psychologist Robert Putnam wrote in his 2000 book " Bowling Alone " about how Americans were growing more disconnected from not only family and friends but also from institutions - churches , civic groups , even bowling leagues - that used to afford community .
More recently , psychologists and other researchers have debated whether the Internet has made us lonelier .
Some argue that access to online social networks helps people stay connected , particularly those who are physically isolated by disabilities or age .
Others believe that having dozens of friends on social - networking Web sites like Facebook is not an alternative to real - life contact - and it creates a false sense of intimacy .
Researchers also recently have been examining the physical effects of loneliness .
With the help of high - tech tools , neuroscientists now can examine how isolation affects the brain .
Functional MRI 's - those that allow a view of the live brain in action - show that lonely people have different neural responses to viewing positive images of other people .
Cacioppo's research has shown that lonely people have more " micro- awakenings " during sleep , leading to greater fatigue , which in turn can affect cognitive thinking .
Other studies have found that people who feel lonely report more sources of stress in their lives , which can affect long - term health .
Chronic stress is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease and immune system disorders .
How much contact ?
What scientists can't tell you is exactly how much social contact you need .
Most people pass through lonely phases at some point .
So how can you tell if you 're at risk ?
Psychologists have used an assessment called the UCLA Loneliness Scale , which consists of 20 questions , all dealing with perceived feelings of loneliness - from inquiries about feeling " in tune " with others to whether relationships seem meaningful or provide companionship and understanding .
People vary in how they perceive loneliness , Cacioppo said , depending on their need for connection .
How a person experiences isolation is partly due to inherited temperament and partly to experience , he said .
Some people are more sensitive to social isolation and therefore experience more stress from loneliness .
Others may have less need for intimacy and may not suffer from having few intimate friends .
Often it 's not the person who lives alone who 's the loneliest .
In fact , being alone is distinct from feeling lonely .
Psychologists say that people with kids , partners and demanding jobs can feel isolated when they fail to heed their own needs for connection .
" Everybody thinks that socializing takes time and effort , " Olds said .
" But it pays off .
Socializing is energizing . "
Shebana Siegel , a San Francisco mother of two and director of philanthropic giving for Jewish Family and Children 's Services , said she has to consciously keep in contact with friends .
She uses her lunch hour to call friends and arrange meetings or walks with them .
" People are so busy and we 're so busy , " she said .
" If you do n't make the effort , you wo n't see your friends .
It 's the American way of life .
I have friends from Brazil who come here and say they 're so lonely . "
Cacioppo's book offers a four - part plan ( called EASE ) , although he concedes the steps are not easy .
Loneliness can add to depression and decrease motivation to make connections .
Cacioppo 's plan includes extending yourself , making an action plan , selecting quality relationships and expecting the best from them .
He and others say that perhaps there is bit of an upside to the current economic crisis - that people will rediscover intimacy .
" People ca n't go out and they have to be home together , " Cacioppo said .
" It 's nice to be able to depend on one another .
If you 're so wealthy that you do n't have to , there is something you 're missing . "
How lonely are you ?
These questions are among the 20 on the UCLA Loneliness Scale , the most widely used tool to measure feelings of social isolation .
The scale was developed in 1978 , and revised in 1996 .
How often do you feel you lack companionship ?
How often you do you feel that there is no one you can turn to ?
How often do you feel that no one really knows you well ?
How often do you feel that you have a lot in common with the people around you ?
How often do you feel that there are people who really understand you ?
How often do you feel that people are around you but not with you ?
How often do you feel shy ?
How often do you feel left out ?

They were neatly collapsed , accordion - style , in a container for launch onboard the Space Shuttle Discovery .
Unfortunately , solar panels have a history of refusing to neatly unfold during installation .
Astronauts have used unconventional methods to solve the problem -- shaking and rattling the panels , for instance .
They even did squats inside the space station once , to set up a vibration running through the panels in an effort to shake them loose .
This afternoon , the Discovery astronauts successfully got the giant , gold - tinted panels to open .
The operation went smoothly -- much more easily than it did with three previous sets brought up on earlier shuttle flights .
It was a two - day process to install the 33,000 - pound truss at the panels ' base .
" We 've had a good day , " mission control told the astronauts .
This is the final set of solar panels to be installed on the space station -- and they will finally bring the space station to full power .
Each solar array set has two 115 - feet wings , making for a total span of 240 feet when one includes the equipment that connects the two halves and allows them to turn as they track the sun .
They generate 66 kilowatts of electricity -- enough to power about 30 2,800 - square - foot homes .
After previous crews ran into trouble with stiction , Mission Control devised a way to keep the arrays from sticking together .
They had the astronauts turn the space station and the shuttle into what 's called a solar - inertial attitude .
" What that really means , " said Flight director Kwatsi Alibaruho before the deployment , " is that we will maneuver in a manner such that one side of the space station is always pointed at the sun at every point in its orbit .
That 's particularly important because of what we have to do thermally with the solar arrays . "
Mission Control : Keep Panels from Sticking
It was a delicate , complicated process -- using the thrusters on the space station and on the space shuttle , firing to keep the entire complex pointed in the right direction toward the sun so that the solar panels would warm up .
Meanwhile , the crew on the space station will also put their plumbing skills to work -- to install a brand new urine processor to replace the one that never worked after it was installed during shuttle mission STS - 126 last year .
The current mission is designated STS - 119 ; shuttle flights often do n't run in order .
This processor will recycle urine and sweat and turn it into drinking water .
It is a critical life support system that must work before the crew on the space station can be expanded from three to six , scheduled for June .
Discovery 's flight has gone smoothly so far .
Just watch out for stiction .
Uh oh Apple -- it looks like even your attorneys are dirty , thieving jailbreakers .
Tipster a|e§ was poring through that iPhone biometric security patent application we posted earlier and noticed that the images show a jailbroken phone , complete with Installer.app , SMBPrefs , and the iWood Realize theme from the iSpazio repository .
We 're guessing the fine folks at Kramer , Levin Naftalis & Frankel are going to have some ' splainin to do on Monday morning -- but at least they get to run apps in the background .
To those of you saying that this is in reference to one of the claims of the patent , we 're not so sure -- there 's no reason for Apple to use images of a jailbroken phone to make that specific point .
Remember , somebody drew this picture , they did n't have to use these specific icons or this theme to illustrate Springboard variations .
[ Thanks , a|e§ ]

I ’m watching a House of Representatives hearing on climate change legislation on c- span.org — it is the most recent in a long string of such hearings that has incorporated the entire week .
Former vice president Al Gore and former senator John Warner , a Republican who urges action on climate change , have just delivered extraordinary statements .
Gore listed study after study that are already finding real , concrete effects of climate change .
He supplied the assembled lawmakers with as much science as they could possibly want .
The much older Warner spoke of growing up during the Great Depression and WWII , and the courage and inspiration that were required to meet the challenges of that time .
He argued that fighting back climate change requires the same qualities today .
Listening to these two men makes it ’s hard not to think a cultural shift has occurred and we ’re finally on our way to a real solution .
And then you stumble on something like the video below , and you realize why a solution has been and will continue to be so immensely difficult .
Below is a man who does not care about Gore ’s science or Warner ’s call to duty .
Below is a man who has found text in the Old Testament that says God , not man , will determine the end of the world , and because that text is infallible in his view all this business about global warming is a bunch of hokum .
That ’s Rep. John Shimkus .
And in case it ’s not clear how he feels about global warming from the video , he said earlier this week , “ I think [ climate change legislation ] is the largest assault on democracy and freedom in this country that I ’ve ever experienced .
I ’ve lived through some tough times in Congress — impeachment , two wars , terrorist attacks .
I fear this more than all of the above activities that have happened . ”
That ’s not just kind of nutty .
It ’s dangerous .

WASHINGTON Anticipation in advance of the coming Group of 20 meeting in London centers on doing something about the excesses in the financial markets that led to the recent housing bubble .
Since those excesses were largely triggered by government actions , the G - 20 would do well to focus on limiting the authorities  capacity to engender future bubbles .
The housing bubble was a creature of the Federal Reserves fabrication of money and credit when neither was warranted by economic activity .
In 2001 , reeling from the bursting of the technology bubble at the end of the 1990s and then the terrorist attacks of 9/11 , the Fed lowered the interest rate target from 6.5 percent to 1.75 percent ; by June 2003 , the rate was down to 1 percent .
In that crucial period , the Fed had to increase the money supply at an annual rate of between 5 percent and 10 percent in order to get the interest rates down to the desired level .
In the process , mortgage rates also came down .
This monetary alchemy was no different , in essence , from the one that led to the Crash of 1929 : During the 1920s , the money supply grew more than 60 percent in total .
It also echoed the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890 , when the government injected dollars into the economy through the purchase of silver .
That brought on the depression of 1893 .
Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan argues that foreign savings were the real culprit of the housing bubble because the Chinese pumped too much money into the U.S. by purchasing Treasury bonds .
But it is the Fed that sets the interest rate target .
By Greenspans own logic , the Fed could have kept a higher target and taken out of the system the excess money originated in Chinese investments in the U.S .
Other factors were the government incentives and mandates that pushed banks to make loans to people who could not afford them .
The incentives took the form of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , government creations that bought mortgages from banks and resold them with guarantees .
The legal mandates included the Community Reinvestment Act , reinforced by Congress in 1999 .
And how ironic that the pooling and repackaging of mortgages in order to attract investors the much - decried securitization behind the housing bubble was originally an act of the Department of Housing and Urban Development , which created the mortgage - backed security in 1970 .
The G - 20 should also bear in mind how much regulation already exists and how ineffective it has been .
A few months ago , in an article in Canadas National Post , Pierre Lemieux , an economist with the University of Quebec , enumerated the norms and bodies that regulate the U.S. financial system .
The list includes the enormous powers given to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1991 and 2002 ; the Sarbanes - Oxley Act that expanded the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission ; the obligation of financial firms to value their assets according to current prices , however undervalued they may temporarily be ; the 31 pieces of regulation administered by the Fed ; and a big expansion of the budgets of all the regulatory bodies in the last five years .
Every previous crisis has generated new regulations and the market , through innovation , has found ways to stay ahead .
When does this stop ?
When the government nationalizes the entire financial system ?
No , not even then , since the response would no doubt be a huge black market .
Washington also contributed to the crisis with its record of rescuing irresponsible banks .
No regulatory deterrent is more powerful than the fear of failure , but that has been effectively removed from large parts of the financial system .
Consider the ludicrous situation the American International Group , the financial giant bailed out by the government , finds itself in .
A near - scandal broke out when politicians learned the names of the important American and foreign banks AIG had paid , after receiving taxpayer bailout funds .
But wasnt the rescue of AIG based on the premise that if it went down it would drag all sorts of important institutions to whom it owed money ?
A few days ago , professor Kevin Dowd of Nottingham University gave a lecture in London on the financial crisis .
He offered the classical economists definition of waste : a bus full of Keynesian economists goes over a cliff and there are still some empty seats .
Lest the G - 20 is tempted to go Keynesian ,  it should keep the joke in mind .
Premier Gordon Campbell has packed away his Dirty Harry rhetoric , Prime Minister Stephen Harper ’s police photo ops are over , the cabinet boys are back from their whirlwind tour of Ottawa and the gang violence continues unabated .
What did you expect ?
Nothing announced by the federal government last week will have an impact on the current urban gang problem .
Sorry .
But true .
And I ’m skeptical the newly appointed “ public - security commissioner ” to lead the province ’s fight against gangs will help .
David Morhart , who has been B.C. ’s deputy solicitor - general since 2005 , does n’t fill me with confidence given the government ’s record — an abysmal Lower Mainland policing arrangement and out - of - control gang violence .
The federally promised murder statute changes are nothing more than legislative legerdemain — gang killings always have drawn first - degree murder charges .
They get plea - bargained away in many cases — and that ’s exactly what will continue to happen .
The new offence of drive - by shootings carrying a minimum four - year prison term , with the possibility of up to 14 years behind bars , is similarly a headline grabber that will have little effect .
Right now , they can hit gangbangers caught doing drive - bys with charges that draw similar time .
The bad guys do n’t care because they rarely ( read : never ) get caught .
As for the mandatory sentences for drug - related offences — the U.S. tried that approach and is abandoning it .
The Tory anti-drug crime bill , for instance , includes a maximum of 14 years in jail for growing cannabis and a two - year mandatory prison term for cultivating more than 500 plants .
Those penalties are way out of step with the threat the substance poses .
These measures wo n’t help ; they ’ll simply increase the price of pot by driving up the risk premium producers charge .
As everyone keeps saying , end the prohibition against cannabis and you ’ll take away the bulk of the money that keeps gangs operating , you ’d raise millions in taxes and you could improve health care and more effectively fight juvenile use of the drug .
Meanwhile , Attorney - General Wally Oppal and Solicitor - General John van Dongen returned empty - handed from Ottawa professing disappointment .
It could have been foreseen .
They were looking for Criminal Code amendments to make it easier for police to breach our constitutional right to go about life free of state monitoring .
There are good reasons for updating the wiretap law adopted in the 1970s to apply to 21st - century technology .
And it is a measure that would certainly help combat gangs .
But those changes must be carefully thought through and the balancing of rights carefully weighed .
The feds realistically can’t move quickly on that .
Sadly , the truth of the matter is we ca n’t bust these gangs without wiretaps , informers and undercover cops infiltrating them at grave risk .
That kind of insidious but necessary policing unfortunately is also expensive .
For the state to engage in these operations requires time , resources , loyalty and long - term commitments .
We do n’t have that in the current policing system in the Lower Mainland .
The other items Oppal and van Dongen were looking for — changes to disclosure requirements ( to speed up trials ) and an end to two - for - one credit for time served — were completely wishful thinking .
The Supreme Court of Canada is the author of the current demands on the Crown to show its hand in criminal cases .
Disclosure requirements are based primarily on fundamental constitutional rights as the court sees them ( not something Parliament can easily mess with ) and that is not going to change anytime soon .
Neither is the two - for - one credit for time served , which is dictated by the provincial court of appeal .
The reason the court has told judges to use that as the norm is the B.C. jail system is overcrowded and prisoners in remand receive rougher treatment than those serving their sentence .
It ’s an issue of fairness and what ’s right , nothing else .
Regardless , neither of these issues is an impediment to charging and prosecuting gangs .
That ’s what was wrong last week with all the political events around gang issues :
They so missed the point :
We want charges laid for blatant cold - blooded crimes , not excuses and promises of new laws .
We ’ve heard it all before .

President Medvedev has announced a major re-armament programme in Russia , and has embarked on a massive reform of its million - strong forces .
Tim Whewell has had rare access to two of Russia 's elite military units , and discovered that the shape of the shake - up speaks volumes .
AT A popular café in Sweetwater , Texas , a lunchtime crowd gathered for a home - style spread of chicken , brisket , beans , corn and cobbler .
A group of men passed the time talking about their children , the oil business , and big - government liberals : how , exactly , were they planning to pay for their stimulus package ?
The men had reason to complain : oil is trading at less than $ 50 a barrel .
Still , they were sanguine .
A man from Coahoma even had a sympathetic word for Barack Obama : he himself had been on the city council for 12 years , and it was nothing but a headache .
Their calm is not so surprising .
Times are tough in Texas , and things will get worse before they get better .
But compared with what has happened in other states , Texas 's wounds are scratches .
Until recently some watchers thought Texas could dodge the downturn altogether .
The state began 2008 in fighting form .
In January 2008 unemployment was just 4.4 % , according to the Texas Workforce Commission ( TWC ) .
Important parts of the economy such as manufacturing , exports and energy were soaring .
The state added thousands of jobs each month , more than any other state , although unemployment kept inching upwards .
The housing crisis looming over much of the country seemed manageable ; home prices had never reached stratospheric levels .
Then things changed .
Tom Pauken , the chairman of the Texas Workforce Commission ( TWC ) , says the trouble started when Hurricane Ike made landfall last September .
The storm caused billions of dollars ' worth of damage to Houston and Galveston and , just as the state was picking up the pieces , Hurricane Wall Street roared in .
Here , as in housing , Texas was not especially hard - hit .
But it was hit hard enough .
“ We can't control our situation any more because of the credit issues , ” says Mr Pauken .
Now there is almost nowhere to hide .
Exports have fallen since the dollar started to strengthen against the euro and the pound .
Manufacturers are reporting sharp declines in production , new orders and shipments .
Almost half of those included in a monthly survey by Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas have cut jobs .
Oil and natural - gas prices are down .
Tech companies in Austin , including Dell , AMD and Freescale , have cut hundreds of jobs .
Southwest Airlines , based in Dallas , plans to reduce its fleet .
Peanut farmers are struggling after a salmonella outbreak killed eight people around the country and spooked customers .
In December 2008 and January 2009 the state lost tens of thousands of jobs .
Unemployment reached 6.4 % in January .
( That was more than a point below the national level , 7.6 % in January . )
And the worst is to come .
Susan Combs , the state comptroller , has estimated that Texas will lose 111,000 jobs in 2009 .
Keith Phillips , a Fed economist based in San Antonio , has a gloomier perspective : he recently predicted that almost 300,000 jobs will go .
There are some bright spots .
Builder , a trade publication , recently ranked America 's healthiest housing markets .
The five top spots went to Houston , Austin , Fort Worth , San Antonio and Dallas — all in Texas .
The number of starts had slowed in each city , but all added jobs and people in 2008 .
“ We 've seen better days , but we 're not pitiful , ” says Kay Vinzant , of the Heart of Texas Builders Association .
Education and health care are growing along with the population .
The state 's energy industry has become more broad - minded .
Ten years ago Sweetwater was a dusty backwater best known for having the world 's largest rattlesnake round - up ( see article ) .
Today it is the windpower capital of the country .
Ray Perryman , an economist who focuses on Texas , mentions another point of solace : state finances are in reasonably good shape .
The comptroller , in her biennial revenue estimate , predicted that Texas would have about $ 77 billion to spend in 2010 - 11 : down 10.5 % from the previous round , because of declining sales and property taxes .
Fortunately the state has several billion dollars in its Economic Stabilisation Fund , set aside against the possibility of a downturn .
With Texas 's share of the federal stimulus set at $ 17 billion , the state may not even need to tap this “ rainy day ” fund .
But even if it comes through the downturn in relatively good shape , there is the future to worry about .
Many now fear that Texas 's low - tax , low - spend model will need revision .

Every once in a while , this activism stuff is easy — you gear yourself up to push hard on a door , and the door turns out to be unlocked .
For months we ’ve been gathering people from around the country for a big protest Monday — the first mass civil disobedience action about global warming in the nation ’s history .
Thousands are headed to Washington , to block the streets around the coal - fired power plant owned by the US Congress that powers Capitol Hill .
It ’s the perfect symbol of how dirty coal is : for those who have to breathe the DC air , for those who have to live by the scalped mountains of West Virginia and Kentucky , and for those who happen to live on a rapidly heating planet .
And now it ’s the symbol of something else : how easy it would be to change .
Late last week , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid released a letter to the Architect of the Capitol , which is what they call the guy who runs the physical plant .
It told him to figure out how to switch the plant over to natural gas .
Just like that .
It was n’t just the demonstration they feared –it was also the 12,000 young people now flooding in to Washington for Powershift ’09 .
( I ’m writing this from the city ’s convention center , surrounded by college kids busy networking , sign - making , and otherwise demonstrating what a movement looks like ) .
Pelosi had promised to speak to the throng , and she was smart enough to figure out one thing that would be on their minds –she ’ll get a well - deserved cheer when she appears .
( UPDATE : Due to weather conditions in Washington , Pelosi canceled her appearance at the Monday rally . )
And not just for closing down the power plant , but for energizing the anti-coal movement with a quick and sweet victory .
We ’ll still be out there on Monday risking arrest , but it will be partly a victory bash .
And partly a reminder that when you push on doors they swing open–sometimes even before you push .
It ’s not usually this simple .
But we ’ll take it .
( On Sunday , The Washington Post did report that the Architect of the Capitol has estimated that converting the power plant will cost $ 7.78 million and that this office did not know how quickly it could be done ; congressional Republicans are asking the architect to determine if the plant could continue to burn coal but more cleanly . )
Meanwhile , we ’ve had an interesting weekend here in DC .
The cable news channels have been focused on covering CPAC , the conservative political action conference at the Shoreham Hotel .
And sure , it ’s kind of fun — the retreat of the dominant political ideology for the last three decades back into its cave , with the puffy figure of Rush Limbaugh still bellowing .
But it ’s also the past .
The future — largely uncovered , but endlessly more exciting — was just a few blocks away , in and around Washington ’s convention center .
It ’s been an activist heaven the last three days — a collection of incredibly talented people , most of them young , busy figuring out how to make the next few decades actually work .
Twelve thousand is a large number — I do n’t know the last time in America that 12,000 activists gathered for anything .
Much less anything as well - organized and determined as this .
Panel after panel has covered everything from the efforts by 1sky.org to find a precinct captain for climate change in every corner of America to our campaign at 350.org to make October 24 the biggest single day of global protest ever .
At night the big name entertainment ( Santigold ! ) has mixed with the big name speakers : Van Jones , new EPA head Lisa Jackson , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar .
It is — I can testify personally — something of a trip to talk to 12,000 people at a time .
Powershift was big when it started in 2007 — 6,000 kids gathered at the University of Maryland — but its doubling in size reflects the fact that the Obama campaign was no fluke .
Young people really are ready to lead the way , which is a good thing since we have to clear so much wreckage from the last few decades .
Jessy Tolkan and Billy Parish — and a crew of dozens and dozens of other young activists — have orchestrated this growing wave for years now , and managed to keep it simultaneously tough and yet open to reality .
These kids are not devoted to cultural revolution — they ’re busy figuring out how to use Twitter and Facebook to carry out the very real tasks of accelerating the switch in our energy system .
But everyone ’s pretty brave , too .
Across the street from the Convention Center , in a warren of converted warehouses , people were busy preparing for Monday ’s protest .
Many of the young people here are facing a tough job market — and so they listened soberly as an incredibly level - headed Greenpeace lawyer explains the ins and outs of being arrested .
No one knows what the police will do , so it ’s hard to gauge the exact risk .
But suffice it to say , in the winter of 2009 it takes courage to risk an arrest record .
To keep that courage flowing , teams of artists next door were busy knocking out signs and banners — and also neckties , because the organizers have made it clear from the start that they hope protesters will turn out “ dressed to impress . ”
Not just because they ’ll seem “ respectable . ”
But because it will remind anyone who ’s looking on that the real radicals are those determined to keep pouring carbon into the atmosphere .
The real radicals have been at the Shoreham cheering Rush Limbaugh .
It ’s odd to think of people collecting bail money and painting placards as the responsible middle , but as we move into the new post - Reagan world that ’s how it works .
The U.S. wind energy industry shattered all previous records in 2008 by installing 8,358 megawatts ( MW ) of new generating capacity ( enough to serve over 2 million homes ) , the American Wind Energy Association ( AWEA ) said today , even as it warned of an uncertain outlook for 2009 due to the continuing financial crisis .
The massive growth in 2008 swelled the nationâ€™s total wind power generating capacity by 50 % and channeled an investment of some $ 17 billion into the economy , positioning wind power as one of the leading sources of new power generation in the country today along with natural gas , AWEA added .
At yearâ€™s end , however , financing for new projects and orders for turbine components slowed to a trickle and layoffs began to hit the wind turbine manufacturing sector .
â€ œOur numbers are both exciting and sobering , â€ said AWEA CEO Denise Bode .
â€ œThe U.S. wind energy industryâ€™s performance in 2008 confirms that wind is an economic and job creation dynamo , ready to deliver on the Presidentâ€™s call to double renewable energy production in three years .
At the same time , it is clear that the economic and financial downturn have begun to take a serious toll on new wind development .
We are already seeing layoffs in the area where windâ€™s promise is greatest for our economy : the wind power manufacturing sector .
Quick action in the stimulus bill is vital to restore the industryâ€™s momentum and create jobs as we help make our country more secure and leave a more stable climate for our children.â€ 
The new wind projects completed in 2008 account for about 42 % of the entire new power - producing capacity added nationally last year , according to initial estimates , and will avoid nearly 44 million tons of carbon emissions , the equivalent of taking over 7 million cars off of the road .
The amount that the industry brought online in the 4th quarter alone â€ “ 4,112 MW – exceeds annual additions for every year except 2007 .
In all , wind energy generating capacity in the U.S. now stands at 25,170 MW , producing enough electricity to power the equivalent of close to 7 million households and strengthening our national energy supply with a clean , inexhaustible , homegrown source of energy .
Iowa , with 2,790 MW installed , surpassed California ( 2,517 MW ) in wind power generating capacity .
The top five states in terms of capacity installed are now :
- Texas , with 7,116 MW
- Iowa , with 2,790 MW
- California , with 2,517 MW
- Minnesota , with 1,752 MW
- Washington , with 1,375 MW
Oregon moved into the club of states with more than 1,000 MW installed , which now counts seven states : Texas , Iowa , California , Minnesota , Washington , Colorado , and Oregon .
About 85,000 people are employed in the wind industry today , up from 50,000 a year ago , and hold jobs in areas as varied as turbine component manufacturing , construction and installation of wind turbines , wind turbine operations and maintenance , legal and marketing services , and more .
About 8,000 of these jobs are construction jobs , and a significant number of those will be lost in 2009 if financing for the pipeline of new projects is not quickly restored .
Wind powerâ€™s recent growth has also accelerated job creation in manufacturing , where the share of domestically manufactured wind turbine components has grown from under 30 % in 2005 to about 50 % in 2008 .
Wind turbine and turbine component manufacturers announced , added or expanded 70 new facilities in the past two years , including over 55 in 2008 alone .
Those new manufacturing facilities created 13,000 new direct jobs in 2008 .
However , because of the recent slowdown in orders , wind turbine and turbine component manufacturers in different parts of the country are beginning to announce layoffs .
â€ œThe hope is that provisions such as those included in the House stimulus bill to restore the effectiveness of the tax incentives for renewable energy will quickly become law and provide the capital needed to continue to build projects , â€ said Bode .
â€ œBecause wind projects can be built quickly , positive legislation from Congress will have immediate and visible effects .
Looking forward , it will also be important for the new Administration and Congress to put in place long - term , supportive renewable energy policies to make the new clean energy economy a reality .â€ 

NEW YORK , March 7 ( Reuters ) -
Where , oh where , did AIG ’s bailout billions go ?
That question may reverberate even louder through the halls of government in the week ahead now that a partial list of beneficiaries has been published .
The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that about $ 50 billion of more than $ 173 billion that the U.S. government has poured into American International Group Inc AIG .
N since last fall has been paid to at least two dozen U.S. and foreign financial institutions .
The newspaper reported that some of the banks paid by AIG since the insurer started getting taxpayer funds were : Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N , Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE , Merrill Lynch , Societe Generale SOGN.PA , Calyon , Barclays Plc BARC.L , Rabobank , Danske DANSKE.CO , HSBC HSBA.L , Royal Bank of Scotland RBS.L , Banco Santander SAN.MC , Morgan Stanley MS.N , Wachovia , Bank of America BAC.N , and Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L .
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs declined to comment when contacted by Reuters .
Bank of America , Calyon , and Wells Fargo , which has absorbed Wachovia , could not be reached for comment .
The U.S. Federal Reserve has refused to publicize a list of AIG ’s derivative counterparties and what they have been paid since the bailout , riling the U.S. Senate Banking Committee .
Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Donald Kohn testified before that committee on Thursday that revealing names risked jeopardizing AIG ’s continuing business .
Kohn said there were millions of counterparties around the globe , including pension funds and U.S. households .
He said the intention was not to protect AIG or its counterparties , but to prevent the spread of AIG ’s infection .
The Wall Street Journal , citing a confidential document and people familiar with the matter , reported that Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank each got about $ 6 billion in payments between the middle of September and December last year .
Once the world ’s largest insurer , AIG has been described by the United States as being too extensively intertwined with the global financial system to be allowed to fail .
The Federal Reserve first rode to AIG ’s rescue in September with an $ 85 billion credit line after losses from toxic investments , many of which were mortgage related , and collateral demands from banks , left AIG staring down bankruptcy .
Late last year , the rescue packaged was increased to $ 150 billion .
The bailout was overhauled again a week ago to offer the insurer an additional $ 30 billion in equity .
AIG was first bailed out shortly after investment bank Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK was allowed to fail and brokerage Merrill Lynch sold itself to Bank of America Corp BAC.N .
Bankruptcy for AIG would have led to complications and losses for financial institutions around the world doing business with the company and policy holders that AIG insured against losses .
Representative Paul Kanjorski told Reuters on Thursday that he had been informed that a large number of AIG ’s counterparties were European .
“ That ’s why we could not allow AIG to fail as we allowed Lehman to fail , because that would have precipitated the failure of the European banking system , ” said Kanjorski , a Democrat from Pennsylvania who chairs the House Insurance Subcommittee .
TOXIC ASSETS / TOXIC WASTE
As part of its business , AIG insured counterparties on mortgage - backed securities and other assets .
The collapse of the U.S. subprime mortgage market , which triggered a global financial crisis , left the insurer and some of its policy holders facing possible ruin as the value of assets declined .
U.S. regulators failed to recognize how much risk AIG was piling on in credit - default swaps , and by the time they understood , they had no choice but to pour in billions of public dollars , Kohn and other officials told the Senate panel .
Senators were outraged by the lack of details about where the bailout money has gone .
“ That we find ourselves in this situation at all is ... quite frankly , sickening , ” said Senator Christopher Dodd , the Democrat who chairs the committee .
“ The lack of transparency and accountability in this process has been rather stunning . ”
Eric Dinallo , superintendent of New York State ’s Insurance Department , railed on Friday against AIG ’s failed business model , likening its insuring credit - default swaps as gambling with somebody else ’s money .
“ It ’s like taking insurance on your neighbor ’s house and even maybe contributing to blowing it up , ” he said at a panel sponsored by New York University ’s Stern School of Business .
U.S. lawmakers have said they are running out of patience with regulators ’ refusal to identify AIG ’s counterparties .
On Thursday , Richard Shelby , the top Republican on the banking committee , said : “ The Fed and Treasury can be secretive for a while but not forever . ” ( Writing Toni Reinhold ; Additional reporting by Juan Lagorio in New York ; Editing by Clive McKeef )
T he Harperization of Premier Dalton McGuinty has been astonishing to behold .
With the minimum - wage flim - flam he pulled last week , the premier has added a certain bloody - mindedness to the increasingly arrogant and autocratic attitude he 's exhibited since his Christmas epiphany .
That was when McGuinty undertook a session of Yuletide soul - searching which led him to conclude he's a leader of boldness rather than an incremental fuss - budget , and when he apparently decided to pucker up for business .
It is bizarre that the Ontario government , in its budget last Thursday , should have reiterated its commitment to raise the minimum wage to $ 10.25 next year , but that within 18 hours the premier was backing off .
" Like all prudent business managers we have to take into account ... the economy as a whole , " he said .
In practical terms , just about everything in any budget is a projection contingent on variables .
But to have singled out one commitment as less equal than others , and before a group strongly opposed to it , blithely undercutting his own finance minister in the process , sends a strong signal the premier is ready and willing to renege .
In its cynicism , it was positively Harper - like .
Once upon a time , McGuinty was at perpetual loggerheads with the Prime Minister and claimed to stand for a different vision .
Now , he seems an increasingly kindred spirit in both substance and style .
In last week 's budget , he served up the sales tax harmonization and corporate tax cuts federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty had long urged in his feud with the province .
The Ontario government even mimicked the feds in the way major components of the budget were rolled out in a series of announcements and leaks the week before its tabling .
The parliamentary convention of releasing such matters to the Legislature has now been sacrificed , by the premier 's own admission , to the greater imperative of news management .
Every day last week , Progressive Conservative MPP
Ted Arnott , as courteous a parliamentarian as there is at Queen 's Park , complained of the disrespect to the institution .
Every day – even on the day McGuinty sang praises to " our heritage and parliamentary democracy " during a ceremony to return the refurbished mace to the Legislature – the premier brushed him off .
To add insult to injury , Arnott was even barred from the Legislature one evening by security when he attempted to fetch a book from his desk because Finance Minister Dwight Duncan – using the place as a glorified rehearsal hall – was inside practising his budget speech .
As a symbol for the diminishment of the chamber into a place of theatre , while the Legislature 's intended work has been outsourced to roving premierial photo - ops , it could hardly be topped .
Finally , it even seems possible now that the premier was less than forthcoming with his own Liberal caucus when the matter of the harmonized sales tax was discussed at a meeting earlier this month .
Afterwards , many MPPs from the government side still seemed to think the matter was up for debate and said privately they were nervous about sparking in Ontario the sort of consumer tax revolt that had toppled governments in other provinces .
" There were lots of questions asked and few answers given , " one MPP told the Star 's Robert Benzie .
It 's difficult to see why answers were scarce .
The deal was already done .
The feds had signed the memorandum of understanding about blending the PST and GST a day earlier .
And Duncan , by the date on the document , was signing it that very day .
By the looks of things , do n't be surprised if the premier 's next musing is about the pleasures of prorogation .

WHEN President Barack Obama wanted to push an $ 800 billion “ stimulus ” or “ recovery ” bill through Congress a few weeks ago , he thought an atmosphere of economic crisis helped his cause .
So he repeatedly warned of “ catastrophe , ” of “ a crisis that , at some point , we may not be able to reverse . ”
A little more than a week later , Obama moved onto his next priority , proposing a unbridled federal budget that will spend $ 3.6 trillion next year and $ 5.3 trillion more in the next 10 years than the Congressional Budget Office was projecting just last year .
To get revenue for this budgetary explosion , Obama assumes the economy will be recovering at a nice clip next year , at a 3.2 percent annual rate .
What happened to the looming cataclysm ?
The Obama team argues that the passage of the recovery package has suddenly brightened the economic future .
But there ’s no way that $ 220 billion in extra government spending ( the amount in the stimulus bill for 2010 ) can be the margin of difference between irreversible catastrophe and healthy growth in a $ 14 trillion economy .
Obama exaggerated the downside of the economy two weeks ago so he could get more spending , and now he ’s exaggerating its upside so he can get more spending .
The fixed goal is more spending .
The means – the rhetoric , the arguments , the assumptions – are flexible so long as they serve that ultimate goal .
The past few weeks should have cleared away the debate over Obama ’s intentions – is he a pragmatist or an ideologue ?
Obama is a pragmatist in pursuit of an ideological prize – willing to zig and zag so long as his lodestar of expanded government is ahead of him .
A trope of conservative commentary about the stimulus package was that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had rolled the neophyte Obama , producing a sprawling monstrosity that betrayed his talk of pragmatism .
This missed the point – Obama ’s deference to Pelosi was his pragmatism .
By giving Pelosi running room and enduring a few embarrassments , he got what he wanted , which was as much new spending as quickly as the political system could bear .
If barely any Republicans could support it , so what ?
Bipartisanship was a means , not an end .
If Obama felt ill - used by this process , he would n’t be proposing to duplicate it with his health - care plan .
Obama wants to give Congress a few principles and a $ 634 billion health - care slush fund , and let Congress go at it and write his health - care plan .
How it works out exactly does n’t matter so much as that it gets done – and government grows .
Obama has been truest to the centrist image he projected in the campaign in his national - security policy , backing away from President George W. Bush ’s practices more in his rhetoric than in his actions .
He hopes foreign policy can be reasonably managed by his team of heavy hitters ( Hillary Clinton , with her troika of special envoys , Richard Holbrooke , Dennis Ross and George Mitchell ) , while he focuses on the more central goal of more domestic spending .
Nothing can distract from that higher call .
The financial crisis is still at the heart of our economic woes , but Obama has refused to grapple with it forthrightly .
The contrast with President Franklin Roosevelt – who acted immediately and forcefully to stem his ( much more dire ) banking crisis – could n’t be starker .
Why punt on the financial crisis ?
Because bold action means courting considerable political risk , and that could threaten the larger spending agenda .
In this sense , the spending is evidently more important than recovery for Obama .
Obama ’s critics who accused him of “ socialism ” during the presidential campaign were roundly ridiculed .
What rank name - calling !
The charge did n’t have much resonance because the best ( not particularly convincing ) evidence for it was Obama ’s proposed tax credit for workers who do n’t pay the income tax .
But Obama ’s opponents read him well .
He has the heart , if not the affect , of an ideologue .
For him , above all else , the spending is the thing .

BOSTON ( Reuters ) - A malicious software program known as Conficker that many feared would wreak havoc on April 1 is slowly being activated , weeks after being dismissed as a false alarm , security experts said .

Conficker , also known as Downadup or Kido , is quietly turning thousands of personal computers into servers of e-mail spam and installing spyware , they said .
The worm started spreading late last year , infecting millions of computers and turning them into “ slaves ” that respond to commands sent from a remote server that effectively controls an army of computers known as a botnet .
Its unidentified creators started using those machines for criminal purposes in recent weeks by loading more malicious software onto a small percentage of computers under their control , said Vincent Weafer , a vice president with Symantec Security Response , the research arm of the world ’s largest security software maker , Symantec Corp .
“ Expect this to be long - term , slowly changing , ” he said of the worm .
“ It ’s not going to be fast , aggressive . ”
Conficker installs a second virus , known as Waledac , that sends out e-mail spam without knowledge of the PC ’s owner , along with a fake anti-spyware program , Weafer said .
The Waledac virus recruits the PCs into a second botnet that has existed for several years and specializes in distributing e-mail spam .
“ This is probably one of the most sophisticated botnets on the planet .
The guys behind this are very professional .
They absolutely know what they are doing , ” said Paul Ferguson , a senior researcher with Trend Micro Inc , the world ’s third - largest security software maker .
He said Conficker ’s authors likely installed a spam engine and another malicious software program on tens of thousands of computers since April 7 .
He said the worm will stop distributing the software on infected PCs on May 3 but more attacks will likely follow .
“ We expect to see a different component or a whole new twist to the way this botnet does business , ” said Ferguson , a member of The Conficker Working Group , an international alliance of companies fighting the worm .
Researchers had feared the network controlled by the Conficker worm might be deployed on April 1 since the worm surfaced last year because it was programed to increase communication attempts from that date .
The security industry formed the task force to fight the worm , bringing widespread attention that experts said probably scared off the criminals who command the slave computers .
The task force initially thwarted the worm using the Internet ’s traffic control system to block access to servers that control the slave computers .
Viruses that turn PCs into slaves exploit weaknesses in Microsoft ’s Windows operating system .
The Conficker worm is especially tricky because it can evade corporate firewalls by passing from an infected machine onto a USB memory stick , then onto another PC .
The Conficker botnet is one of many such networks controlled by syndicates that authorities believe are based in eastern Europe , Southeast Asia , China and Latin America .

AMONG THE COMPETING STORIES about how to stop gangbangers from slaughtering each other , here ’s the leading contender from the street : Sometime in ’ 77 or ’ 78 , at a South Central L.A. junior high , a Grape Street Crip named Loaf , from the Jordan Downs housing project , sticks a knife into a Bounty Hunter Blood named Night Owl , from Nickerson Gardens , killing him on the spot .
One bloody reprisal leads to a hundred bloody more , feuds spread through the two other big Watts projects — Imperial Courts , home of the PJ Crips , and Hacienda Village , home of the Circle City Pirus .
With all of them warring against each other — Crip against Crip , Crip against Blood — and the crack wars raging , and L.A. gunslingers wasting 800 people in 1992 alone , Watts becomes the national epicenter of the shadow fantasy that lives in the heart of every American , that Boyz N the Hood dystopia in which lunatic teenagers troll the streets with AK - 47s , gunning down suckers without remorse .
To be hopeful is to be a fool — it ’s all going to hell , steer clear — but , to hear Aqeela Sherrills tell it , the answer comes from the black community itself .
First , Louis Farrakhan introduces a handful of rival gangbangers to Jim Brown , the retired NFL Hall of Fame running back .
Brown directs a self - empowerment nonprofit called Amer - I - Can , and he starts inviting the four gangs up to his posh Hollywood home , feeding them pizza around the pool and pushing them to lay down arms .
It ’s not all love and kisses :
One of the PJ Crip OGs , a guy named Tony Bogard , had just shot and killed a Grape , and the Grapes riddle Bogard in return , though not fatally .
But Daude Sherrills , Aqeela ’s older brother and a Grape OG , finally writes a cease - fire treaty based on the text of the Israel - Egypt truce of 1949 .
The only thing left is to make it real , to walk each other ’s streets without fear , and it ’s Aqeela who actually talks a handful of his fellow Grapes into the unthinkable : driving down to Imperial Courts and stepping into the broad daylight of the PJs ’ turf .
As soon as they show up , Aqeela says , people start running into their houses , yelling , “ All the cats from Jordan Downs over here ! ”
But then Bogard emerges , demanding they step into the gym for a conference .
“ He was talking about how , ‘ This ca n’t happen just like this !
It ’s going to take years !
I just got shot up ! ' ” Aqeela recalls .
“ But our Gs was over there , too .
A lot of these cats is dead now , but they had a higher level of consciousness , and they was all just like , ‘ Fuck that shit , you know , we ai n’t never going to heal all that !
That ’s in the past .
We got to make this shit right for the little homies . ’
I was 25 at the time , so a lot of us young cats was like , ‘ Man , let these old niggas stand in the gym and talk .
Niggas ai n’t going to shoot nobody , let ’s go outside . ' ”
So they do .
They walk right into a crowd of PJs .
“ The young cats from the Imperial Courts , ” Aqeela says , “ they was like , ‘ Man , you all wit it ?
You all wit the peace ? ’
And we was like , ‘ Yeah , we wit it ! ' ”
Right then , in Aqeela ’s memory , “ it was like , ‘ Fuck it , it ’s on ! ’
People yelling it , house to house , it was unbelievable , you could see people coming outside , ‘ It ’s on !
The peace treaty on !’
Mobs of people driving up , girls seeing dudes they been wanting to see for years . ”
By the next morning , which was also the day the Rodney King riots erupted , the cease - fire party had rolled back to Jordan Downs , the Circle City Pirus had shown up to make amends , and yes , even the Bounty Hunters , all those years later , came just to let bygones be bygones .
“ There were so many peace - treaty babies , it was ridiculous ! ” says Sherrills .
And here ’s why this story matters :
Gang violence plummeted nationwide in the years that followed , along with an overall drop in violent crime , but while the overall number remains stable , youth homicide is rising again .
Since the late 1990s , in fact , the only demographic to see an increase in murder victims is men between the ages of 25 and 34 , and 67 percent of killings between young men are gang - related .
According to the FBI ’s Uniform Crime Report for 2004 , the latest with complete data , juvenile gang homicides have jumped 23 percent since 2000 .
And there ’s no new drug epidemic to explain the change , nor is it confined to the ghetto .
Much of the new gang activity is occurring in the affluent D.C. suburbs , sleepy Provo , Utah , even the Northern California wine country , which has provoked a new round of that old hand - wringing about how our kids got to be so psychopathic , and why we return again and again to this same awful place .
If we brought down the violence before , one can’t help wondering , why ca n’t we bring it down again ?
And that ’s why the story of the so - called Watts truce is so important :
In the dysfunctional national conversation about how to move forward , it turns out that none of the leading players can agree on what worked last time , what exactly is happening this time , or , least of all , what to do next .
“ People who really understand the street , ” according to professor David Kennedy of New York ’s John Jay College of Criminal Justice , “ all understand a fundamental truth : that the stories we tell about gang violence are wrong .
There are a couple of basic ones , and they ’re all wrong . ”
TALK TO LOS ANGELES POLICE Chief William Bratton , the former New York City police commissioner who currently has jurisdiction over the largest gang - violence problem in the world , and you get a picture of enormous , well - organized gangs proliferating nationwide and even internationally .
A veteran of New York ’s crackdown on the Sicilian Mafia , of Boston ’s early successful experiment with community policing , and of New York ’s now - famous “ Broken Windows ” approach to stopping urban decay , Bratton has successfully encouraged the FBI to develop a new “ National Gang Strategy . ”
Targeting the biggest and most advanced gangs with a combination of RICO prose-cution , intelligence gathering , and special investigative techniques , the FBI ’s new approach is modeled after those used on traditional organized crime — ” something that I ’ve been advocating since I came to Los Angeles and saw the scope of the problem , ” Bratton says .
“ It was quite clear that it had grown to national proportion , so that gangs that began here in L.A. or Chicago had now begun to spring up in other areas . ”
Local police departments , in Bratton ’s view , are simply too limited in their jurisdiction .
“ The tools that the feds can bring into the equation , ” he says , “ their investigative powers , their sentencing powers , it would be crazy not to take advantage of that .
I had experienced that in New York , working with the FBI in their attack on the old - style mafias , and how they were able to break their backs , and the belief that you could use many of the same prescriptions against these gangs , whether they be Latino or African American , the two principal groups I have to deal with here . ”
To that end , in fact , an FBI task force has just been established specifically to dismantle Mara Salvatrucha , a.k.a.
MS - 13 , an international gang that started among Salvadoran immigrants in Los Angeles .
But to hear it from people on the street , like Aqeela Sherrills , who has become a national figure in grassroots peace activism , speaking at dozens of conferences as far away as Croatia , running a Watts - based nonprofit that brokers truces between gangs all over the country , and meeting with the likes of director Michelangelo Antonioni and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams , Bratton is missing the point .
The mid-’90s drop in crime , in the view of Sherrills , happened not because of any top - down policing strategy but because thousands of men and women just like Sherrills , in a homegrown , street - level effort now called the urban peace movement , began devoting their lives to the tedious work of defusing conflict , day in and day out .
Most gangs , they ’ll tell you , are less about drug dealing or violence than about community , desperate young people looking for surrogate families .
“ A lot of people think that there ’s a level of sophistication within the gang culture like the Mafia , ” Sherrills says .
“ Not at all .
There ’s no organization , there ’s no nothing . ”
The Crips gang , Sherrills insists , admitting that he is still a member , “ is not a sophisticated entity in any way .
There ’s probably 1,200 cats in my neighborhood , and it ’s all broken up into cliques .
So you got the Parolees , the Peta Roll Squad , the Boss Players , you got the Tiny Locs , and they all claim Grape .
But they all in they own cliques .
And you got the jackals in the neighborhood , people who rob folks , the drug dealers , the peacemakers , and then you got the killers .
Individuals who are known , who shoot people . ”
Responsibility for the new upsurge in violence , in Sherrills ’ view , has nothing to do with the gangs at all .
It has to do with the system , with America ’s ongoing refusal to address poverty and racism , its continuing manipulation by the prison - industrial complex , and the government ’s betrayal of peacemakers , switching funding back over to the construction of jails and the arming of police forces .
Kennedy , a leading academic criminologist and the architect of the only anti-gang - violence strategy that has ever worked against modern street gangs , shares much of Sherrills ’ view .
As chief designer of Operation Ceasefire , Kennedy presided over a public - private antiviolence initiative that got such dazzling results , so fast , that it is now known in law enforcement circles as the “ Boston Miracle . ”
Using a mix of prosecutorial and psychological tactics , Ceasefire has since been replicated in so many small to medium - sized cities that it has emerged as academic criminology ’s answer to the urban peace movement , the favored gang - crime control strategy of the intellectual best and brightest .
And like Sherrills , Kennedy sees the emphasis on huge , hyperorganized crime syndicates as a red herring , a distraction from the real engine behind the routine murder of young men in American cities , and a product of the misconceptions that the public and the police have about gangs .
The first of these misconceptions , Kennedy says , echoing Sherrills , is that gang members are murderous superpredators .
“ That ’s not true , ” he says .
“ One of the interesting things about these guys is that if you can pull one aside and talk to him away from his boys , they start talking about how shit - scared they are , and how they do n’t like this stuff , but if they do n’t act in certain ways their friends and their enemies all turn on them .
You get the occasional psychopath , but most of these guys do not have the same commitment to violence that they might to making money on the street . ”
In the words of T. Rodgers , founder of the Bloods crew in the notorious “ Jungle ” neighborhood , where Training Day was set , there are only two kinds of gang members , “ cowards and kids , and both of them just want attention . ”
“ Another story is that it ’s all about drugs , ” Kennedy says , “ and that ’s not true either . ”
While most gang members do participate in the drug trade , the popular image of Crips and Bloods battling for crack - dealing turf is as outdated as the movie Colors .
Nor , in Kennedy ’s view , is gang violence a sickness somehow endemic to ghetto culture — ” because almost everybody in these neighborhoods does n’t participate .
Hardly anybody goes this way . ”
In Boston , Kennedy found that even within the most gang - dominated neighborhoods , fewer than 5 percent of young men were gang members .
A 2004 outburst of gang killings in San Francisco produced a similar finding :
Only about 100 young men in the entire city were thought to be truly dangerous , and a couple dozen were thought to have done most of the killing .
“ But because almost everybody deals with one or another of those fictions , ” Kennedy says , “ it ’s very hard to engage with what ’s really going on . ”
What ’s really going on , in Kennedy ’s view , is small groups of young men encouraging each other to violence .
“ It ’s about respect , ” he says .
“ It ’s about boy - girl stuff , it ’s Hatfield and McCoy . ”
This , too , is nearly uni-versal among people on the front lines , from Sherrills to T. Rodgers to former police captain Rick Bruce in San Francisco ’s notorious Hunters Point neighborhood :
Gang killings are not about huge , hierarchical cri-minal organizations struggling for control of drug - dealing turf .
They ’re about beefs .
They ’re about patterned webs of vendettas and retaliations .
Somebody looks at somebody wrong , or two guys want the same girl , and it ’s on .
In San Francisco , for example , nearly 20 tit - for - tat homicides over the past decade have been traced back to a single car auction , after which a gangster killed a man who outbid him for a vehicle .
“ You have to keep in mind , ” says T. Rodgers , “ that between the ages of 11 and 17 they ’re warriors untried .
From 17 to 21 , it ’s ‘ What ’s your claim to fame ?
I can impregnate every girl on the block .
Or I can knock you out with a right or a left . ' ”
It ’s what University of California - Irvine criminologist George Tita calls “ expressive violence rather than instrumental violence . ”
Tita says that even among gangs that are involved in the drug trade — and most are , in some way or other — the leaders will gladly negotiate trade agreements with one another even as their foot soldiers murder each other over petty slights , because strict street codes dictate a violent response to nearly any perceived insult and every individual is terrified of falling short of those codes .
But because group psychology , among a relatively small number of young men , is the clear engine of an enormous percentage of urban violence , it ’s a perfect point of intervention .
KENNEDY WAS A RESEARCHER at Harvard ’s Kennedy School of Government in the early ’90s , when the Bounty Hunters and Grapes were gunning each other down and gangs in Boston ’s poor neighborhoods started doing much the same .
The city ’s response , throughout the early 1990s , was like a blind grope through crime - control strategies .
In addition to stop - and - search policies for all suspicious young black men and halfhearted attempts at community policing , there were street workers like the Sherrills brothers talking down gangbangers , even a powerful outreach effort by a coalition of churches , galvanized by a killing during a church memorial for a murdered gang member .
Good stuff , and crucial to the success that came later , but it all amounted to gathering the pieces of a puzzle without putting them together — until 1994 , when the National Institute of Justice ( NIJ ) funded Kennedy and his colleagues .
They started by forming a working group of all the law enforcement and community elements already involved — street workers , juvenile corrections , clergy , probation , parole , police — and even added a few , like the DEA .
Then , in March 1996 , when fighting between rival factions of the Vamp Hill Kings killed three gang members in the space of a month , they made a quick series of arrests , with help from the ATF and even local school police , and held a forum with virtually the entire membership of the Vamp Hill Kings .
Supported by local clergy and community members , the working group then did what Kennedy calls “ retailing the message . ”
The message went like this : Violence stops now , the adults are taking over , and the new penalty structure says that if anybody in your gang puts a body on the ground , the whole crew pays , and fast .
Every unserved trespassing warrant will get served ; every petty parole or probation violation will get enforced ; smoke a joint in public housing and you ’ll get evicted ; open a single beer on the street or piss on the sidewalk and you ’ll go to jail .
With the help of street workers , Kennedy ’s working group also made it clear to the Vamp Hill Kings , and soon after to other gangs , that this was not an indiscriminate war on gangs .
It was a crackdown on violence alone .
Gangs that did n’t indulge in violence would be spared .
And everyone was getting the same story , so if you chose not to retaliate for a slight , you had an honorable excuse :
Your whole crew would go down .
Flyers at the forum described a gangster named Freddy Cardoza who ’d just gotten 20 years without parole for being caught with a single bullet .
The working group balanced the stick with the carrot of job - training services .
The point was to leverage group psychology in such a way that the group itself would have an interest in discouraging violence .
It was wildly successful .
Within 12 months of the Vamp Hill Kings forum , youth homicides in Boston dropped by 73 percent .
In little over a year , Operation Ceasefire returned Boston ’s youth homicide rate to a place it had n’t been in decades .
And in much the way the Watts truce triggered a nationwide paroxysm of truce - making , Attorney General Janet Reno started talking about a nationwide rollout of Operation Ceasefire .
More than a dozen smallish cities have actually done it , with stunning results .
Indianapolis , for example , saw a 40 percent drop in its annual murder rate , and Rochester , New York , in 2004 , saw a one - year drop , from 31 to 9 , in the number of young black males murdered .
In February 2004 , a long - planned Ceasefire intervention for the nation ’s capital was triggered into action when a gunslinger from a gang that terrorized the Sursum Corda ( Latin for “ lift up your heart ” ) housing project shot a 14 - year - old girl who was a witness to an earlier shooting .
Within days , 36 gang members had been arrested on drug conspiracy charges , and dozens of other gangs had been contacted to make sure they understood exactly what had happened to the Sursum Corda gang — and how to avoid a similar fate .
BUT HERE’S THE RUB : Ceasefire , which is also known as the “ pulling levers ” approach because it involves a simultaneous pulling of all the relevant levers on violence , is very hard to hold together .
Our government is built around the parsing out of human life , assigning our need for shelter to one agency , our need for law enforcement to another , our health and employment and education to still others .
Getting all those agencies to work together — asking government to address the complex nature of a human life , in a holistic fashion — requires extraordinary commitment from all parties involved .
And as soon as you get a new U.S. attorney with other priorities , or your housing authority gets caught up in a distracting scandal , or a lowered crime rate encourages a redistribution of funding , things fall apart .
Boston itself saw a 67 percent rise in homicides in 2001 , to a near doubling of the 1999 rate .
Something similar is happening now in Rochester , with gang violence roaring back after a one - year hiatus .
In both cases , Kennedy gives credit for the initial success to everything that ’s right about Ceasefire — new Ceasefire interventions continue to have dazzling success — and he blames the subsequent failures that have occurred to the loss of momentum that comes with complacency .
“ As it existed in 1996 or 1997 , Ceasefire is entirely gone , ” Kennedy has said , speaking of Boston .
With funding from the NIJ , George Tita and the RAND Corporation ran a pilot Ceasefire program in an L.A. neighborhood that followed the same pattern :
After initial success , the working group drifted apart , and nobody in law enforcement or the community took responsibility for keeping it alive .
All this makes it easy for Bratton and L.A. County Sheriff Lee Baca to dismiss Ceasefire as having little relevance to Los Angeles , which is significant to the overall national picture because , at some level , Los Angeles is the national picture .
Accounting for 75 percent of all 10,000 youth gang homicides committed in California between 1981 and 2001 , Los Angeles also accounted for fully 30 percent of the entire mid-1990s drop in the national youth - homicide rate ; remove Los Angeles from the picture , and the story is very different , with equal numbers of cities reporting declines and surges in youth homicide .
Individual Los Angeles gangs are also dramatically larger in membership than gangs elsewhere , they do spawn copycat gangs in other parts of the country , and they are so deeply entrenched as to be almost like community organizations .
As Bratton points out , L.A. now exports Crips , Bloods , and L.A. - branded Latino gangs not only to every major city in the United States — and to most minor ones — but to Canada and Mexico .
Aqeela and Daude Sherrills , in fact , were invited to New Jersey last year to work as peacemakers precisely because one of the warring Newark Crip factions was calling itself Grape Street , even though none of the Newark Grapes had ever been to the Sherrills ’ neighborhood .
( Aqeela tells a funny story about Newark Crips asking him about various secret handshakes and rituals they ’d learned , wanting to be sure it was all authentic :
He ’d never seen any of it before . )
Trying to stop American gang violence without stopping it in L.A. , in other words , is like trying to reduce global warming with no help from the United States .
But if you so much as mention Operation Ceasefire in Los Angeles law enforcement circles , you find a thinly concealed contempt .
Baca , who recently helped the Crips and the Bloods reaffirm the 1992 truce , calls the Boston strategy “ good for a community that has 50 or less murders a year .
I would wish that we had that small a problem in L.A .
We have 500 - plus gang - related murders a year … spread out over 800 square miles . ”
Baca ’s own prescription leans toward the liberal — a personal commitment to various nonprofits that teach so - called “ life skills ” to troubled youth , offering counseling and job training , and mentoring from police officers .
Bratton , who is arguably the most important law enforcement official in the United States on the issue of gangs , is equally dismissive of Ceasefire .
“ There ’s no magic bullet , ” he says .
“ There is no single solution .
And while the patient may exhibit similar characteristics , what might work in Boston may or may not work in Los Angeles .
Boston ’s gang problem is very small .
I ’ve got 50,000 gang members versus Boston ’s couple of hundred . ”
As for his limited interest in street workers like Sherrills , Bratton would n’t be the only one with uncertainty about their effectiveness .
It ’s not that anyone thinks their work is n’t helpful , but there ’s no consensus on how instrumental it is , largely because nobody can get any data .
Criminologist Tita , for example , takes the work of urban peacemakers so seriously that he has a photocopy of the original Watts truce hanging on his office wall — the one drafted in part by Daude Sherrills — and he keeps a database of 40 years ’ worth of Watts homicide statistics .
“ And look , trust me , ” Tita says .
“ I ’ve done the literature search .
I ’m still looking for — and I have the opportunity to write — the very first real evaluation of a gangs truce .
Tell the Sherrills brothers that I ’m begging them to come down and meet with me and let ’s design it together so that there ’s no ambiguity . ”
But for whatever reason , Tita says , they have n’t heeded that call .
And with the data Tita does have , he cannot find a single statistically significant effect of the Watts truce .
“ I even looked at the gangs that signed the treaty versus the other gangs in the community , ” he says .
“ Did their rates of participation as homicide victims or offenders change ?
I could n’t find that either . ”
The problem with truces , according to T. Rodgers , who still does gang - outreach work in the Jungle , is that “ there ’s always a kid in the back of the group that says , ‘ Fuck that shit . ’
And that ’s all it takes . ”
But Rodgers bridles at the suggestion that he needs evidence to prove the worth of what he does .
“ I ’m just going to say it , ” he growls .
“ White folks come in with a magnifying glass and always want to know how shit works with a MacGyver theory .
And some things just do n’t work like that .
Some things are acts of God , some things are behavioral miracles . ”
He claims 60 to 70 percent effectiveness in getting gangbanging kids to go straight .
“ But I did n’t track them , ” he admits .
“ I ’m not the RAND Corporation .
I ’m just a street worker . ”
Aqeela Sherrills feels the same way .
“ Even though the peace in the neighborhood is fragile as fuck , ” he says , “ we maintain it , through dialogue and conversation , and it do n’t mean ai n’t nobody getting shot .
It means that ’s all part of the process , that peace is not a destination .
It ’s a journey , like life .
And there ’s a movement in this country that wants everybody to see things through this lens , that if things are n’t like this , then it ai n’t real .
But as long as we can consistently come back to the table and have a conversation , the peace exists .
As long as I can walk into the Nickerson Gardens and talk to those cats over there , it ’s on .
As long as we can go holler at Sister and PJ Steve , it ’s on .
As long as we can talk to Daude and Big Tank and Cal Boneski and the key brothers at Jordan Downs , the peace is fucking on .
And that ’s our reality .
Because if people really knew what the fuck it was like around here , you know , man , they ’d cry every fucking day . ”
ACCORDING TO A 2002 REPORT from the National Institute of Justice , gathering 10 years of gang - related research , the view of street gangs as akin to the Mafia is indeed misguided .
Data from a survey among almost 300 large police departments and members of four large Chicago and San Diego gangs found that while a few gangs —
MS - 13 would be one — are very large and organized , the vast majority show “ little evidence of evolution into formal organizations resembling traditional organized crime .
Instead , the gangs appeared to represent an adaptive or organic form of organization , featuring diffuse leadership and continuity despite the absence of hierarchy . ”
Most gangs , in other words , are just a bunch of guys hanging out on the corner .
The NIJ report , titled “ Responding to Gangs : Evaluation and Research , ” also found that traditional “ get tough on crime ” approaches — like the mass arrests of gang members and specialized gang task forces currently being directed at MS - 13 — have literally zero measurable impact on overall gang violence .
( As if to prove the point , a press conference by Sheriff Baca , trumpeting the success of a recent anti-gang street sweep , was marred by simultaneous news of three Compton homicides . )
Ditto for the Gang Deterrence and Community Protection Act , the draconian bill passed by Congress in 2005 , which defines a gang as having as few as three members — just enough to make a federal conspiracy case — calls for stiff mandatory minimum sentences for gang - related crimes , and puts tens of millions toward prisons :
The NIJ report shows conclusively that exaggerated jail terms have no deterrent effect at all .
The only responses that were found to be successful were the “ life skills ” programs that Sheriff Baca advocates , teaching conflict resolution and positive self - esteem , and , to a much greater degree , the Boston Ceasefire intervention .
Ceasefire , in fact , is the only strategy singled out in the entire report as having caused a substantial reduction in youth homicide , and yet Bratton and the FBI appear utterly uninterested .
Bratton is also ignoring a report commissioned by the California Attorney General ’s Office — ” Gang Homicide in L.A. , 1981 - 2001 ″ — written in part by George Tita and released in 2004 , which concluded with a single , strong recommendation : that L.A. adopt a Boston Ceasefire approach .
This may have to do with the past experience of various players — Bratton headed the Boston Police Department when gang killings had the whole city in a panic , and he left shortly before Ceasefire took effect and made Boston famous for solving the problem .
He was also part of New York ’s “ Broken Windows ” successes and glamorous takedowns of the Mafia .
One approach has worked very , very well for him , in other words , and the other has been mostly somebody else ’s baby .
But Kennedy places the blame on less personal habits of thought .
Most of us , he says , jump to one of two very different responses to crime : the criminal justice response , which is all about the moral responsibility of individuals and the belief that tougher enforcement can influence those individuals ; or the root - cause approach , which emphasizes the role of racism and economic inequality in crime .
The problem , Kennedy says , is that neither approach leads to an effective crime - control strategy .
The criminal justice framework has no way of accounting for the fact that gang crime is overwhelmingly about “ incidents in response to incidents in response to incidents that happened before , and which will affect incidents which will happen later , ” and the root - cause framework ignores the fact that some people simply do need to be locked up .
The criminal justice framework does make room for attacking certain groups — as in the anti-racketeering and conspiracy cases that brought down the Mafia and that are now at the center of the FBI ’s anti-gang strategy .
But these cases will never solve the problem if they are not combined with a larger response that targets group psychology .
“ I do n’t have any sense , ” Kennedy says , “ that any of the people who put that together talked to anybody who knows about these issues . ”
As a result , Kennedy says , the FBI ’s new war on gangs is “ as tired as it can possibly be . ”
The biggest problem , though , in Kennedy ’s view , lies with the dysfunctional nature of American law enforcement .
Comparing criminal justice to “ a real profession , like medicine , ” he points out that if there ’d been a breakthrough in breast cancer treatment in Boston in the mid-1990s , and 70 percent of women who would have died of breast cancer were living , “ then when people were talking about breast cancer in San Francisco they would not say , well , nobody ’s made any headway on this , this is an intractable problem , we ’re going to start from scratch .
And if they did , then their patients would hold them accountable , but there is no mechanism like that in criminal justice .
There is no real professionalism .
How do you get to be a judge ?
Get a law degree .
How do you get to be a DA ?
Get elected .
There is no collective knowledge , no relationship between theory and practice .
There was a time when surgeons were barbers , and what medicine did was bootstrap itself up .
In criminal justice , we ’re still barbers , and if people in these communities , paying the tax bills and burying their kids and visiting their raped daughters in intensive care , knew the way business was conducted , there would be bodies hanging from oak trees .
The presumption that most people have , that this is serious , thoughtful work , and that if you do n’t get good results it ’s because absolutely nothing works , is so wrong .
And if people really knew , I swear , there ’d be blood running in the street . ”
About SSL
Secure Socket Layer ( SSL ) , or its successor Transport Layer Security ( TLS ) , gives us assurance of two things :
Firstly when a client connects to a web server , the client can be sure that it is talking to the right server by checking the certificate the server sends it .
Secondly , SSL assures you of the confidentiality of the data , as the client and the server exchange encrypted messages that cannot be understood by anybody else .
Before messages can be encrypted , the client and the server need to shake hands and exchange a secret key for this session , the so - called session key .
This is how the SSL handshake works ( using RSA ) :
Server sends certificate :
When the client requests for a SSL page , the server sends a certificate that it has obtained from a trusted certificate authority .
Client generates session key :
This certificate contains the public key of the server .
After satisfying itself that the certificate is correct and the server is a genuine one , the client generates one random number , the session key .
Encrypt the session key and send it :
This key is encrypted using the public key of the server and the private key of the client .
Then it will be sent across .
Server decrypts it :
The server decrypts the message with its private key .
Now both sides have a session key known only to the two of them , because only the server and the client have access to their private keys needed for decryption and encryption of the session key .
All communication to and fro will now be encrypted and decrypted with the session key .
SSL Ciphers and Protocol
This is a simple SSL handshake , because only the client makes sure talking to the right server , but not the other way round .
Today ’s browsers normally perform only a simple SSL handshake .
In the first phase of the handshake the server and the client also exchange the highest TLS protocol version and a list of suggested cipher and compression suites .
In most browsers SSL version 2 is disabled by default as it is insecure .
But you can also disable SSL version 2 and several cipher suites on the server side .
In order to find out about what ciphers with high strength ( 128 or more bits ) your server machine supports , type in :
$ openssl ciphers - ssl3 -v ‘ HIGH :!ADH:@STRENGTH ’
This will display a list of ciphers ordered by its strength and without anonymous DH ( ! ADH ) which is very basic .
Make sure to specify the SSL ciphers your webserver is going to use in its configuration to at least the “ HIGH : ! ADH ” level .
Many web servers try to be as compatible as possible by default and accept 40 , 56 and 80 bit DES keys , but they are very weak .
This configuration works in all modern browsers .
It is highly recommended denying weak ciphers by only accepting 3DES and AES SSL cipher suites of at least 128 bits and above .
Here is an example SSL configuration for nginx – Apache configuration should be similar .
ssl on ;
ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/example.com.crt ;
ssl_certificate_key
/etc/nginx/certs/example.com.key ;
keepalive_timeout 70 ; #reduces the cpu load
ssl_protocols SSLv3 ; # only use SSL version 3
ssl_ciphers HIGH :!ADH ;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on ; # do n’t trust the client
# caches 1 MB of SSL sessions in memory , faster than OpenSSL ’s cache :
ssl_session_cache shared : SSL:1 m ;
# cache the SSL sessions for 5 minutes , just as long as today ’s browsers
ssl_session_timeout 5 m ;
Replay attacks
Hackers might also try to repeat recorded requests .
In order to fend of these replay attacks , the SSL handshake protocol uses random numbers and sequence numbers .
If someone repeats old sequence numbers , the server will reset the connection .
Cryptographic attacks
The attacks against SSL include cryptographic attacks .
Brute Force Attacks on the cryptography aim at breaking the cryptography in use .
It is feasible to break a 40 - bit key by brute force attacks , but it takes a fairly large number of computers .
Therefore keys should be at least 128 - bits long , though 256 - bits are standard now .
You also want to use AES encryption , as it is the successor of 3DES .
When generating a public and private key for the certification authority , you can choose to enter a pass phrase with at least 8 characters .
This pass phrase is like a password and you will need to type it in to start the web server using the SSL key .
You can leave the pass phrase out if you want , but this is less secure .
One reason to leave it out would be that automatic restarts of the web server will work then .
Man - in - the - middle attack
A man - in - the - middle ( MITM ) attack is only successful when the attacker can impersonate the client and the server and when he has access to the network of the client ( like an insecure wireless LAN ) .
The man - in - the - middle behaves like the server for the client and sends the clients ’ requests to the original server .
It also behaves like the client to the server .
The MITM uses his self - generated certificate to authenticate against the user .
Therefore today ’s browsers include a list of mutual trusted certification authorities and throw an error when certificate is self - signed .
There are also many cases where the client ’s browser issued a warning that the certificate is not valid , but in real life most users ignore this message and just accept it .
This protection might only be circumvented if a certification authority cooperated with the attacker or if the attacker managed to create his own certificates signed by a certification authority known to the victim ’s browser .
The latter means breaking a cryptographic hash function , such as MD5 , which is already theoretically possible .
SSH ( Secure Shell ) provides a method to check the fingerprint of the server ’s certificate after the first login .
This fingerprint will be verified on each next login and it will throw an error if it changes .
MITM attacks are quite unlikey , but not totally unfeasible .
Software versions
It is very important to always run the latest versions of OpenSSL and nginx or Apache .
Recently there was a vulnerabilty in OpenSSL which rendered several SSL certificates insecure .
SSL and Rails
Rails provides the request.ssl ?
method to find out whether it is HTTP or HTTPS .
In order to make this method work correctly , you have to include the following line in your web server configuration file in the HTTPS part :
proxy_set_header X-FORWARDED_PROTO https ;
This is how it works in nginx , and it should be similar in Apache .
More details are here .
The problem is , that a malicious user could pretend that this request is HTTPS by intercepting a request and sending a “ X - FORWARDED_PROTO : https ” header field over HTTP .
Whether this may do any harm to your application depends on your application .
But you do n’t want the users to pretend , do n’t you ?
Note that this works with a stand - alone Mongrel , but I could n’t manage it when a front - end web server ( nginx , Apache ) is there .
Nevertheless , it might be possible .
Countermeasures and Conclusion
18 Ways Attention Goes Wrong
Imagine if every time you walked into a room with a neatly turned down bed , you automatically took off your clothes and got into it — even though it was n’t bedtime , was n’t your bed , and was n’t even your home .
This might sound fanciful but it ’s a documented behaviour of patients with attentional problems caused by brain damage ( Lhermitte , 1983 ) .
Many everyday occurrences can also be explained by attentional errors , like when we miss obvious changes in the environment , fail at sports or simply forget to put the milk back in the fridge .
More seriously psychologists have found that attentional processes can play a role in psychological problems like anxiety , panic , insomnia , depression and obsessive - compulsive disorder .
Here are 18 ways attention can go wrong , some very common , some extremely unusual , a few downright weird ; each giving us an insight into how our minds work .
1. Utilisation behaviour
Experienced by people who have suffered certain types of damage to the frontal lobes : patients find themselves unable to resist the routine actions suggested by objects around them .
They will get into neatly turned down beds , even though it ’s not their bed ; they will put on glasses , even though they do n’t wear glasses ; and they will start eating when they see a plate and cutlery , even though the plate is empty and they ’re not hungry .
These strange behaviours , reported by Lhermitte ( 1983 ) and others , are partly caused by an inability to inhibit automatic behaviours , it ’s like the old comedy standby of a distracted person continuing to spoon sugar into their coffee , except much more extreme .
2. Spatial neglect
Brain damage can produce weird shifts in behaviour and experience .
People with damage to certain areas of the right hemisphere fail to pay full attention to things they see on their left ( because of the way the brain is wired , the right hemisphere processes information about the left - visual - field ) .
They may only eat the food on the right - hand - side of their plate , or only shave half their face .
They seem to see things to the left , but not to notice them .
3 . The rubber gloves illusion
Competition for attention between the senses can create strange illusions .
In one spooky study by Spence et al. ( 2000 ) , participants were made to ‘ feel ’ a touch on empty rubber gloves in front of them , despite their own hands being hidden from sight underneath the table , free from tactile sensation .
This suggests information from the visual system can override attention to tactile sensation ( or lack thereof ) from the hands , to create an apparently impossible sensation .
4. Pain
Even more than sight , though , pain is the ultimate attention - grabber .
Unsurprisingly people who experience chronic pain of one kind or another can find it difficult to concentrate ( Ecclestone , 1995 ) .
Pain pulls sufferers ’ attention away from task demands and forces them to continually re-focus to achieve their goal .
One of the promising treatments for people suffering from chronic pain is ‘ attentional management ’ : effectively helping people to direct less attention to their pain ( Elomaa et al , 2009 ) .
5 . The cocktail party problem
The ‘ cocktail party effect ‘ is our impressive ability to tune our auditory attention to just one voice at a party .
Unfortunately for those with hearing loss this can become the cocktail party problem , a difficulty in separating one voice from all the others .
Hearing aids can be somewhat helpful , but often ca n’t restore full function ( Marrone et al. , 2008 ) .
This shows just how sensitive aural attention is to vocal characteristics : without precise information on spatial location , onset , offset , intensity and prosody , it ’s much more difficult to pluck one voice from a multitude .
6. Alcohol myopia
My favourite technical term for the insidious effect alcohol has on attention .
After a couple of beers long - term consequences of actions are ignored in favour of short - term impulses .
The intoxicated become attentionally short - sighted , even failing to spot clear environmental cues that things are going to end badly .
Of course I would n’t know anything about that : I just read it in a book .
Ahem .
7. Errors of automaticity
When our attention is distracted we carry out highly practised behaviours automatically , occasionally at inappropriate times .
Like putting the milk out and the cat in the fridge .
In a classic diary study of everyday slips and lapses Reason ( 1979 ) got people to describe all sorts of cute out - of - context slips .
One person reported unwrapping a sweet ( candy to the rest of you ) , throwing the sweet away and putting the wrapper in his mouth , another to putting shaving cream on his toothbrush and another to going upstairs to change for the evening , then finding himself wearing pyjamas .
Although practice makes perfect , it can also make an unthinking robot .
8. Inattentional & choice blindness
It ’s absolutely incredible what changes people will miss when they ’re distracted .
Participants in psychology studies fail to spot a gorilla in plain sight ( Simons & Chabris , 1999 ) ; do n’t notice their conversational partner has suddenly changed mid-conversation , albeit hidden by a conveniently passing door ( Simons & Levin , 1998 ) ; and frequently fail to recognise which of two people they originally chose as the most attractive ( dubbed by the authors choice blindness ) .
9. Ironic processes of control
In fact sometimes attention is a real bear .
What about when you really want to get something right , like putt the ball , hit a beautiful serve right in the corner or reverse the car into a narrow space ?
Naturally you concentrate even harder than normal , really focus .
Unfortunately that just seems to make things worse : you miss the putt by a mile , frame the ball 50ft in the air and ding the car .
What gives ?
These are what Wegner et al. ( 1998 ) call ‘ ironic processes of control ’ .
Sometimes too much attention is just as detrimental as too little .
10 . Insomnia
It ’s all very well smirking at the irony of people unable to putt , serve or park , but anyone who has suffered insomnia knows it ’s no laughing matter .
Attention gets a look in here as well .
Recent research suggests that insomnia may be partly explained by an attentional bias towards ‘ sleep - related threat ’ ( Harvey et al. , 2005 ) .
In other words insomniacs keep themselves awake by focusing too much on the bodily sensations associated with sleep and any environmental noises that might be keeping them awake .
Unfortunately also somewhat ironic .
11 . Attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD )
Now the most well - known of attention disorders , it consists of three broad types : ( 1 ) mostly inattentive , ( 2 ) mostly impulsive and hyperactive and ( 3 ) all three ( jackpot ) .
Those with the attention - deficit component find it difficult to concentrate , are easily distracted and likely to day - dream .
The vast majority of those diagnosed with ADHD are children .
ADHD is often partly treated with a stimulant ( Ritalin ) , along with behaviour therapy .
12 . Anxiety
You may be surprised to learn that anxiety is a sort of attention disorder , but being overly self - focused seems to be involved in many different mental health problems .
Amongst people with social phobia and social anxiety their self - focused attention tends to maintain the problem ( Spurr & Stopa , 2002 ) .
It makes perfect intuitive sense : a person continually thinking about themselves in social situations is bound to become more self - concious .
Unfortunately it ’s another rather ironic process .
13 . Panic attacks
Paying too much attention to bodily processes is a strong feature of those who experience panic attacks .
Clearly we should all pay some attention to our bodily processes – otherwise we ’d just ignore the toothache and our teeth would drop out .
But people who experience panic attacks are hypervigilant to somatic sensations ( Schmidt et al. ( 1997 ) .
One person ’s heartburn is another ’s death - knell .
14 . Hypochondriasis
And talking of paying too much attention to bodily sensations , you ’ll be unsurprised to learn that hypochondriacs tend to be hypersensitive to odd twinges ( Barsky et al. , 1988 ) .
15 . Eating disorders
Again people with eating disorders like anorexia nervosa seem to have attentional biases around body image ( Rieger et al. , 1998 )
16 . Obsessive - compulsive disorder ( OCD )
People with OCD typically carry out particular tasks — like hand - washing — repeatedly in order to relieve anxiety about an obsession .
Excessive attention towards anxiety - inducing thoughts , particularly those that are threat - related seems to be at least partly to blame ( Lavy , 1994 ) .
17 . Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD )
After experiencing a traumatic event , most people will recover given time , but to a significant minority relief is elusive .
They experience flashbacks , nightmares and the feeling of losing control .
Attention seems to be involved as PTSD sufferers are especially attracted to and vigilant for negative stimuli in the environment ( Vythilingham , 2007 ) .
18 . Depression
Like those with PTSD , people experiencing depression also show an enhanced processing for negative stimuli ( Ingram et al. , 1994 ) .
One important maintaining process in depression is thought to be rumination .
Individuals who are more prone to going over negative experiences again and again are more susceptible to developing clinical depression .
Well balanced
In many , perhaps all these examples of how attention can go wrong , it is n’t just attentional processes that are causing grief ; psychological problems are frequently caused by many different factors .
What this list does demonstrate , though , is how disruptions to attentional processes can cause or are involved in all kinds of different problems .
Something that psychologists are heard to say increasingly often is that the potential for many of these extreme experiences is within all of us .
Anxiety , panic , insomnia and the rest are a part of the human condition – everyone can empathise to some extent .
What strikes home is how delicately balanced attentional processes have to be in order to produce pleasant everyday experience .
Too little attention and it ’s difficult to achieve goals in life , too much attention and it ’s hard to break free from loops of negative thinking and feeling .

Many naughty children have been ordered to hand over video game controllers and disks to their rightful owners .
Now Activision , makers of Guitar Hero , have suffered the same fate .
It ’s the result of a legal case involving Activision and Genius Products , both of whom are working on DJ - related games .
Genius is working on a game named Scratch : The Ultimate DJ , which it outsourced to developers 7 Studios .
Activision made an offer to buy the rights to the game , which Genius turned down .
However , 7 Studios had financial difficulties and was bought out by Activision .
As you ’d imagine , Genius did n’t take too kindly to this once it realised Activision was working on its own game , DJ Hero – and now had access to the code behind Scratch .
It immediately cut off dealings with Scratch .
The dispute wound up in court , where a judge ruled that Activision must hand over the code for Scratch , noting that Genius had paid 7 Studios around $ 6 million for the work and had full rights to it , despite the takeover .
The judge appeared bemused at Activision ’s arguments that it should n’t have to give back the code , noting “ No matter how you slice this banana , they are entitled to the work product back . ”
He later added “ It is theirs .
It belongs to them .
They paid $ 6 million for it .
I ’m done . ”
The ruling also forces Activision to hand over designs for controllers specially made for the Scratch game , and bans 7 Studios staff from sharing any information about Scratch with their new bosses at Activision .
However , the judge did not agree to Genius ’ request for a one - year injunction blocking Activision from releasing a rival game .
There will be another hearing on May 6 to settle Activision ’s counter - claim that Genius should pay damages for cancelling its contract with 7 Studios .
The function of a protein is determined both by its structure and by its interaction partners in the cell .
Until now , proteins had to be isolated for analyzing them .
An international team of researchers from Tokyo Metropolitan University , Goethe University , and the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies ( FIAS ) has , for the first time , determined the structure of a protein in its natural environment , the living cell .
Using nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy , the researchers solved the structure of a protein within the bacterium Escherichia coli .
“ We have reached an important goal of molecular biology ” , says Prof. Peter Güntert from the Goethe University ’s Biomolecular Magnetic Resonance Center .
( BMRZ )
The research results will be published by the scientific journal Nature on March 5 , 2009 .
Conventionally , proteins are extracted from the cell , purified , and analyzed in single crystals or in solution .
NMR spectroscopy detects signals from the nuclei of hydrogen atoms that are ubiquitous in organic molecules .
Measurements in the living cell are challenging because it is difficult to distinguish between the protein of interest and the many other proteins in the cytoplasm .
The Japanese researchers around Prof. Yutaka
Ito solved this problem by introducing the gene of a putative heavy - metal - binding protein into the model system Escherichia coli , where the protein was in high concentration .
The success of the measurements relies on the method of “ in- cell ” NMR spectroscopy that was developed a few years ago by Prof.
Volker Dötsch from BMRZ at Goethe University .
Dötsch was able to attribute signals from living cells to specific proteins that he had labeled with the stable nitrogen isotope N - 15 .
However , it was not possible to calculate a three - dimensional structure .
“ About two days of measurement time are required to measure a multidimensional NMR spectrum ” , says Peter Güntert .
“ Unfortunately , the cells survive for only a 5 - 6 hours without supply of oxygen and nutrients .
Güntert and his colleagues compensated for the concomitant drastic reduction of the measurement time by computational reconstruction of the complete spectrum .
Then , they calculated a detailed three - dimensional structure of the protein within E. coli cells using software that was developed in their research group .
The structure determination of proteins by in - cell NMR spectroscopy opens new avenues to investigate at atomic resolution how proteins participate in biological processes in living systems .
In - cell NMR spectroscopy advances our understanding of the molecular basis of life , and can contribute to the development of new , better targeted pharmaceuticals .

Esta pregunta puede ser más importante de la que crees .
Antes de tomar cualquier medicamento vía oral , lo que siempre tienes que hacer es investigar sobre el mismo , porque casi siempre los médicos esconden información al paciente para que éste no se asuste con los efectos adversos que tienen los remedios .

La decisión de tomar o no estas pastillas , será decisión tuya , pero aquí te contaré bien cómo son las cosas .
Roacutan nació hace más de 20 años con el nombre de Accutane , remedio actualmente suspendido en Estados Unidos , debido a las numerosas demandas que han surgido en los últimos 10 años especialmente .
Este tipo de remedio utiliza la isotretinoína para eliminar el acné , y la verdad , es que es muy efectivo a la hora de hacer su trabajo .
Pero cualquiera puede preguntarse , “ si existe la cura para el acné , por qué hay tantos productos más ” .
La respuesta es : porque no existe ninguna pastilla o producto que lo pueda curar , Roacutan tampoco .
Entre las pastillas para eliminar al acné podemos encontrar de todos tipos y tamaños , y si empezamos a hablar de los efectos secundarios de cada una , nos volveremos locos .
El problema de las pastillas para quitar granos y espinillas es que , aquellas que en principio funcionan , luego a los meses o al terminar el tratamiento , todo vuelve a la normalidad .
Pero el mayor problema es que todos estos medicamentos tienen efectos adversos , muchas veces muy dañinos y otras veces permanentes .
Es decir , pueden dañarte permanentemente la salud .
Este es el caso de Roacutan .
Las probabilidades de contraer efectos adversos , por lo general , son muy bajas .
Pero el hecho de que exista ese pequeño porcentaje , el peligro sigue latente , porque tú puedes ser el próximo .
Cuando comencé a investigar sobre Roacutan , empecé a encontrar una especie de sopa de letras : unos decían que era lo mejor y otros advertían que no tomasen el remedio .
Seguí investigando y comencé darme cuenta que había muchos sitios exclusivamente creados para informar sobre este medicamento pero de la forma de “ piensen bien antes de tomar estas pastillas ” , como es el sitio que les coloqué arriba en este párrafo , que para mí es el mejor en cuanto a información .
Continué investigando y efectivamente existen muchos casos en los que estos efectos secundarios graves realmente se habían dado ; y esas personas estaban muy arrepentidas de haber tomado Roacutan .
Pero también encontré cosas más serias , como por ejemplo , el discontinuo de Accutane en Estados Unidos , y las múltiples demandas y juicios perdidos por Roche , el laboratorio que fabrica estas pastillas .
Todo eso me hizo pensar dos veces a mí también .
Tomar el medicamento más fuerte que existe para eliminar el acné conlleva sus riesgos .
Puedes tomar dos caminos , tomar Roacutan y esperar curarte , arriesgándote a contraer sus efectos secundarios más graves , o buscar otro camino para quitar los granos y espinillas .
Lo que sí tengo que advertirte por todo lo que sé , la mayoría dice que es una cura temporal , luego vuelve todo el acné .
La decisión es de cada uno , pero por mi parte , recomiendo al igual que yo hice , leer bien para poder decidir qué hacer .
En mi opinión , Roacutan , sería una última alternativa , si tu acné es grave o muy grave .
Will Wright talks about a Spore MMO , the iPhone , and Cloning .
I recently had the pleasure of sitting down with a long time idol and childhood hero Will Wright for a candid conversation .
Armed with 20 questions provided by the Spore and Sims communities on Wikia , I set out to discover what the future holds for Spore , why he loves the iPhone and Rock Band , and , more importantly , should the inevitable demon - robot - communist - zombie apocalypse occur in his lifetime , where he would side .
With a great library of franchises including SimCity , The Sims ( which happens to be the best selling PC franchise in history ) and now Spore , Will Wright has become a dominant figure in gaming , and in the way we interact with and learn from technology .
More importantly though , he is one cool cat ; do n’t take my word for it -- read some highlights from the interview and click the link for the full interview below .
What types of social expansions do you have planned for Spore ?
We have actually looked at taking Spore and the entire galaxy and making it an MMO … [ b ] ut we are also looking in the form of personal experiences , more peer - to - peer , face to face ; a simple civil network with buddy lists players can subscribe to forecasts and stuff like .
People love to share what they ’ve made and it has more meaning if it is from somebody you know .
So we are looking at some things where people can kind of in real time share their creatures and have them interact with each other in interesting and social ways .
We have a long list of things that we want to put in Spore that are either a ) part of the original vision or b ) things that we developed along the way for our own purposes , and now we have a shelf full of parts .
When we look at what people are doing with spore , we can say “ what can we pull off the shelf to give people new experiences in the directions they want to go . ”
So its partially informed by what the players are doing now with the game and where we see them hitting brick walls or barriers and partially informed by what we have , that we can realize very quickly , as well as things that we are experimenting with using the data we got .
Are there any games , besides Spore , that you thought were innovative in 2008 ?
I love Rock Band … I was also looking at some of the indy games like Braid , very nicely done , a fine jewel of a game .
The scope of these games is what is important , they feel retro , because it ’s not a huge gigantic feat with hours of game play , you can get into them in a couple of minutes .
I have always liked the Wii stuff ; it feels so out of the box .
I have also been spending a lot of time playing games on my iPhone .
The amount of power in the iPhone is more than what was in my first computer .
X - Plane is a great game , and Cartoon physics is also a favorite and the iPhone is a very intriguing gaming platform and people are using the accelerometer in creative ways .
If you were caught up in the middle of a Zombie - Robot - Demon - Communist apocalypse , what would you do and what would be your method of choice for eliminating evil ?
For eliminating evil , I probably would align myself with the robots right off the bat .
Because I think they would be more , in some sense , predictable and I think the communists stand no chance against robots , so they are write offs .
Demons , I do n’t know I tend to think that if you do n’t believe in their powers they become powerless .
Zombies are a bit problematic just in the numbers game that they represent .
But yet all you have to do is take their heads off and that is a fairly simple ( and robots are very good at doing that ) .
So I think the Robots really have more diverse possibilities of strategy then the other ones .
The other ones are more singular with what they are doing and what their purposes are , you know the communists want people to become communists and Zombies want people to become Zombies .
So I would definitely align myself with the robots right off the bat .
Where it gets a little tricky in how do you usurp once the robots are winning how do you prevent them from totally taking you out with them ?
Will you clone yourself for the insurance of future great games ?
No .
No , I think it is important that the generation eventually dies off and the next generation takes over .
That is pretty much the lesson of Jurassic Park – if you bring dinosaurs back to life bad things will happen .
They had their shot , they did what they did and they set the stage for us mammals , and in bringing them back , nothing good will happen .
Is your life not quite Wright ?

-- Interview by Douglas Kennedy
One must remember that these memo ’s were drawn right after the attacks of September 11 ’th 2001 .
They were , for all intents and purposes rejected by the Bush Administration .
However it does give a glimpse into the minds of those in charge of the country , in the days after September 11 .
Via the AP :
The Obama administration threw open the curtain on years of Bush - era secrets Monday , revealing anti-terror memos that claimed exceptional search - and - seizure powers and divulging that the CIA destroyed nearly 100 videotapes of interrogations and other treatment of terror suspects .
The Justice Department released nine legal opinions showing that , following the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , the Bush administration determined that certain constitutional rights would not apply during the coming fight .
Within two weeks , government lawyers were already discussing ways to wiretap U.S. conversations without warrants .
The Bush administration eventually abandoned many of the legal conclusions , but the documents themselves had been closely held .
By releasing them , President Barack Obama continued a house - cleaning of the previous administration ’s most contentious policies .
" Too often over the past decade , the fight against terrorism has been viewed as a zero - sum battle with our civil liberties , " Attorney General Eric Holder said in a speech a few hours before the documents were released .
" Not only is that school of thought misguided , I fear that in actuality it does more harm than good . "
The Obama administration also acknowledged in court documents Monday that the CIA destroyed 92 videos involving terror suspects , including interrogations — far more than had been known .
Congressional Democrats and other critics have charged that some of the harsh interrogation techniques amounted to torture , a contention President George W. Bush and other Bush officials rejected .
Related segment on MSNBC , on Keith Olbermann ’s Countdown :
Here are all of the said documents from the Justice Dept
It must be emphasized that these opinions were rejected by the Bush Administration and never used , however , it does gives insight into the mindset of the previous Presidential Administration and Justice Department under the Bush Administration after the 9/11 attacks .
It has been already speculated that there could be prosecutions brought on , because of this document dump , and there are lawsuits pertaining to the destruction of tapes by the CIA , in regards to torture .
I personally believe that this is just the tip of the iceberg of stunning revelations to come , about the conduction and secrets hidden by the former administration .
It will be an interesting story to follow indeed .

The renegade Wall Street fund manager Bernard Madoff could plead guilty as early as next week to swindling clients out of billions of dollars by running a Ponzi scheme masquerading as a $ 50bn investment empire .
A court document filed by US prosecutors today revealed that Madoff , 70 , has waived a formal grand jury indictment - a step usually taken by defendants negotiating a plea bargain .
The US government will outline charges against him at an arraignment hearing in Manhattan scheduled for Thursday before a federal judge , Denny Chin .
A guilty plea by Madoff would amount to an admission that the once respected Wall Street fixer masterminded one of the biggest financial scams in history .
Madoff almost certainly faces a lengthy prison sentence , although a plea bargain could affect prosecutors ' treatment of his family and could influence the type of jail in which he is incarcerated .
James Cox , a professor of corporate law at Duke University , said : " I can't imagine that he will avoid prison .
There would be a huge outcry if he did n't go to jail .
But he may be able to plea over the type of prison . "
Madoff has been under house arrest at his penthouse apartment on New York 's upper east side since December when was charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission with running a " massive " long - running fraud at his fund management empire .
At the time , prosecutors said he had confessed to his sons that his firm was " one big lie " and " basically , a giant Ponzi scheme " .
The authorities believe that his firm , Madoff Investment Securities , did virtually no trading but simply used new customers ' deposits to pay out purported profits to existing clients .
There has been considerable speculation over the fate of Madoff 's wife , Ruth , who , according to court papers , withdrew $ 15.5 m from an account at a firm linked to Madoff Securities in the days running up to her husband 's arrest .
In a legal filing this week , Madoff 's lawyers sought to ring - fence $ 70 m of assets which , they said , belong to Mrs Madoff , including the couple 's New York apartment .
Mrs Madoff has not been charged with anything .
Neither have Madoff 's sons , Andrew and Mark , who were senior executives at Madoff Investment Securities .
Victims of the scam range from the Hollywood stars such as Kevin Bacon and Steven Spielberg to charities , hedge funds and prominent members of America 's Jewish community .
Such is the vitriol over the case that Madoff recently wore a bullet - proof vest for his own protection to attend a court appearance .
The author and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel , who lost his life savings in Madoff 's fund , last week described the financier as a " psychopath " , adding : " This man knew what he was doing .
I would simply call him thief , scoundrel , criminal . "
The fact that Madoff remains on bail has caused controversy .
Richard Breeden , a former chairman of the SEC , expressed outrage today that he remains out of prison .
" Bernie Madoff should be in the worst prison and not in his apartment , " Breeden said .
" It may reflect an era in which the SEC was too light in its treatment of the scum who think stealing other people 's money is acceptable behavior . "

Infants can be taxing , or so I 'm told .
Being a trusting fellow , I used to just take my brother at his word , but now I have definitive proof , and it comes in the form of poop .
How does one go about measuring stress , and where does the poop come in ?
Most animals respond to stress by releasing steroids to liberate extra energy .
In some animals , this steroid release follows a seasonal cycle ; in others , it is released in response the environmental stresses .
In mammals , for example , steroid release is often related to behaviors such as aggression .
It can also be related to social contexts , such as the number of males present in a group , or simple factors such as the individual 's age .
One challenge of monitoring animals for stress is that one must avoid causing additional stress in the process .
Otherwise , one might fall prey to some macroscopic form of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle .
As a result , one should n't go around capturing animals to measure their steroid levels .
Fortunately a wonderful thing happens naturally every morning : some animals find a quiet place to leave their own little fecal samples .
Perhaps not surprisingly , it turns out that the steroid content of their feces is related to their internal steroid levels .
Thus , a researcher has only to come along afterwards with a pooper - scooper and can collect all of the samples he or she desires , all without stressing out the subjects .
That is precisely what a group based in North Carolina and Georgia did .
In a study published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society , the researchers reported the results from 867 fecal samples that were collected , oven - dried , and analyzed in a lab for the steroid glucocorticoid .
These samples came from the primate Sifaka ( a type of lemur ) .
In addition to these samples , the researchers kept records of the behavior patterns of the Sifaka , allowing them to correlate behavior and stress .
Among other things , they analyzed the glucocorticoid levels for relationships to age , social group stability , alpha male status , and the presence or absence of infants .
Surprisingly , the group was unable to find any statistically significant difference in glucocorticoid levels for any factor except the presence of infants .
They hypothesize that infants will cause increases in steroid levels to allow the males to protect the infants against invaders .
During their field campaign , they witnessed 5 such invasions and , in all cases in which the invasion was successful and there were initially infants present , the infants disappeared , most likely as a result of infanticide .
OK , so maybe Sifaki poop is n't the definitive proof that infants cause stress in humans , but I would be willing to wager that if you measured my fecal glucocorticoid levels , they would be elevated if and / or when I have a little one of my own .

Bob Coan 's relationship with smallmouth bass and Dale Hollow Lake in north - central Tennessee  a relationship based on respect and admiration  spans five decades .
He 's generally credited with refining the float - and - fly technique and making it one of the most productive wintertime smallmouth fishing systems ever devised .
Known for his attention to detail and for his ability to regularly boat 5 - and 6 - pound smallmouths , Coan views himself as a teacher .
He 's a man whose life mission is to spread the word about smallmouth bass , the float - and - fly technique and Dale Hollow Lake .
Bob Coan is a " SuperGuide . "
" I grew up in eastern Kentucky , near the headwaters of the Cumberland River , where I fished for smallmouth as a kid , " he explains .
" And , every so often , I traveled with my grandfather and my uncles to Dale Hollow where we fished for them some more .
Smallmouth bass was all I knew in those days .
" After high school I moved to Louisville , Ky. , where I worked for Ford for 30 years .
Good smallmouth bass fishing is hard to find in that part of the state so I went back to Dale Hollow every chance I got , usually two or three times a month .
When I retired I moved there full - time .
" With the benefit of such a great fishery and teachers like Billy Westmorland I learned something about these magnificent fish and how to catch them .
It 's been a lifelong experience , but one well worth the effort . "
Coan believes that it's the small refinements that separate good fishermen from great fishermen .
Coan is a detail man , little things matter to him .
In his world learning about them meant learning the details , the small refinements that separate good fishermen from great fishermen .
For years he caught cold water smallies by bouncing blade baits and jigs off the bottom .
He developed strategies and techniques that worked .
Days with a half - dozen really good bass were common .
But that did n't satisfy Coan .
He believed there was something better , something that would take advantage of the bass in the warmer layer of water that lies along the top of the reservoir in the winter .
" I knew there were two groups of smallmouths in Dale Hollow .
The first fed on alewives and lived deep .
They were plentiful and big but not like the ones that lived shallow and fed on the threadfin shad .
" That second group was what I wanted to target .
That 's where the giants lived and fed during the winter .
But I could n't get them to bite .
My problem was finding a lure that moved slowly and looked natural but that would still ride along between 9 and 15 feet deep .
" I tried everything I could think of but never did come up with a satisfactory solution until the early 1990s when I first saw the float - and - fly .
I knew as soon as I saw it that it would catch them .
In those days it was a simple rig  a small hair jig tied with a long leader under a fixed bobber .
We 'd cast it out wherever we could find threadfin shad .
The feeding smallies would take it like a crappie takes a minnow . "
Over the past 15 years Coan has developed and refined the float - and - fly technique and its associated tackle into one of the best cold water smallmouth systems ever devised .
He now targets specific areas with specific rods , reels , line , swivels , flies and attractants .
Four - and 5 - pound smallmouths are now common from the Hollow .
Over the past 15 years Coan has developed and refined the float - and - fly technique and its associated tackle into one of the best cold water smallmouth systems ever devised .
And true to his teaching philosophy , he willingly shares his system with his clients every year from late November through the middle of March .
" I try to teach my customers the mechanics of float - and - fly fishing and show them what tackle they need as well as help them put a few big smallies in the boat .
But I also want my guests to understand smallmouth bass .
" They need to see for themselves the two groups of smallmouths and how each group relates to their choice of forage , how wintertime smallmouths will hold over open water below threadfin shad and why small , nearly motionless baits catch the biggest fish in cold water .
" Most of all , however , I want them to leave with an appreciation of smallmouth bass and Dale Hollow Lake  two of the greatest natural treasures on earth . "

Apple 's implementation of a digital video answering machine , once destined for inclusion in an earlier version of Mac OS X , has been resurrected in a patent filing , suggesting the company may give the concept a second go in the near future .
Background
The feature would allow users of the Cupertino - based company 's iChat messaging application to pre-record audio and video messages that would be provided to other users — or " callers " — when the recipient is away from their computer or tied up with other tasks .
This concept is n't entirely new , however .
It first surfaced in pre-release builds of Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard back in December of 2006 — nearly a year before the operating system was released to the public with all traces of the feature removed .
In those pre-release builds , an " Answering " tab had been added to iChat 's preference pane that allowed users to configure their digital answering machine .
It provided an interface for recording video answering machine messages with built - in iSight cameras and instructing the chat application when to transmit the message to incoming callers .
For example , iChat could automatically respond to incoming callers with the pre-recorded video message when a user had their status set to " Away , " or could choose to issue the video message manually when the status was set to " Available . "
Video Answering Machine
In a 13 - page patent filing published this week , Apple provided a detailed explanation of the technology with some new additions .
In addition the aforementioned status preferences , the video message could be provided in response to a video chat request after a period of time had elapsed since receiving the video chat request , the company said .
Alternatively , the video message could be sent when no user input has been received for a period of time exceeding a threshold , meaning the recipient is likely away from their computer .
Similarly , the message could be provided when the value of iChat 's status indicator indicates a " do - not - disturb " status .
" Thus , the video chat system can be used as an always - on service without unnecessarily interrupting the user while the user is engaged in another chat session or another task , " Apple explained .
" The audio - video messaging services are provided using an answering machine - type application that is familiar to most users who have used conventional telephone answering machines . "
Video Answering Machine Server
Taking the concept a bit further , Apple said video answering machine messages could be uploaded to a video chat server via the Internet .
This would allow the video chat server to respond to any incoming chat requests with the video message even when the recipient is n't logged into their iChat account .
Callers could then respond to the pre-recorded video answering machine message with their own video message :
The responsive video message , in some implementations , can be stored in a video mailbox within the video chat server attached to the network connection .
In this example , when the call recipient next connects to the network connection and activates the video chat component , some or all of the contents of the video mailbox can be downloaded or otherwise be made available to the computer for viewing by the call recipient .
NL Architects proposed this design for the Taipei Performing Arts Center to host a variety of large - scale performances , including dramas and operas .
The structure contains three theaters including a 1500 - seat Grand Theater , and two 800 - seat theaters for repertory performances .
With “ four legs ” that support a “ tabletop ” , critics praised the aesthetics of the design , but noted two critical issues : the acoustics in such a huge structure would be disastrous , and there would be a lack of sun for several of the cubes .
In the end , the Office for Metropolitan Architecture ( OMA ) won the competition to build the Taipei Performing Arts Center .

BANGOR , Wales , April 10 ( UPI ) --
Deadly saw - scaled vipers that feed on scorpions are far more dangerous than those that eat mammals and reptiles , a Welsh researcher says .
Axel Barlow of Bangor University began studying the snakes , one of the major killers in West Africa , to determine why anti-venom does not help some bite victims , the North Wales Chronicle reported .
He found that the scorpion - eaters ' venom is about 30 times as toxic as that of other saw - scaled vipers .

Barlow is collaborating on his research with the Venom Research Unit at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine .
" The West African governments continue to buy this anti-venom from India , but it does n't work , " Barlow said .
" It 's kind of intuitive that a snake 's venom is going to be more toxic to the type of animals that they feed on . "
Anti-venom is produced by injecting snake venom into horses , causing them to produce antibodies , and then harvesting their blood .
To work , anti-venoms must be matched to the type of venom produced by the snake involved in the bite .
More About Rapa Nui - Easter Island
Rapa Nui is the most remote inhabited island on earth .
You may recognize this place by its common title " Easter Island " .
The island pokes out of the ocean with one hundred fifty square miles of area , but this is only the tip of a giant extinct volcano rising ten thousand feet from the ocean floor .
Easter Island got its Christian name on Easter Sunday in 1722 , the day that Dutch explorer Jacob Roggeveen landed there .
He found the natives in a primitive society engaged in constant war with each other , resorting to cannibalism at times of no other food being available .
He was followed in 1770 by a Spanish captain who claimed the island for Spain , in 1774 by Captain Cook of England and in 1786 by a French admiral .
The general lack of water , wood and food left them equally uninterested in using Easter Island as a place to resupply their ships .
The mysteries of Rapa Nui are these -- how did people get here in the first place , how did they MAKE these gigantic statues , and then how a civilization could have degraded from such a cultural and artistic peak , backwards to a state of poverty and starvation ?
The standard tale of the people on Easter Island is that overpopulation and poor resource management led them to their own extinction .
It 's commonly used as a warning to the entire globe , telling all humans not to make the same mistakes on a planetary scale .
Another version of the story might include the European introduction of smallpox , venereal disease , slavery and oppressive government as a warning to the entire globe , telling all humans not to make the same mistakes on a planetary scale .
In any case , take another look at these images and be happy you have such a nice home planet to live on .

Robert Brenner .
Marxist economist Robert Brenner was interviewed by Seongjin Jeong for Hankyoreh , one of South Korea ’s leading daily newspapers .
The interview was published on January 22 , 2009 .
* * *
Seongjin Jeong : Most media and analysts label the current crisis as a ``financial crisis ' ' .
Do you agree with this characterisation ?
Robert Brenner :
It 's understandable that analysts of the crisis have made the meltdown in banking and the securities markets their point of departure .
But the difficulty is that they have not gone any deeper .
From US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and US Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke on down , they argue that the crisis can be explained simply in terms of problems in the financial sector .
At the same time , they assert that the underlying real economy is strong , the so - called fundamentals in good shape .
This could not be more misleading .
The basic source of today 's crisis is the declining vitality of the advanced economies since 1973 and , especially , since 2000 .
Economic performance in the US , western Europe and Japan has steadily deteriorated , business cycle by business cycle in terms of every standard macroeconomic indicator -- GDP , investment , real wages and so forth .
Most telling , the business cycle that just ended , from 2001 through 2007 , was by far the weakest of the postwar period , and this despite the greatest government - sponsored economic stimulus in US peacetime history .
How would you explain the long - term weakening of the real economy since 1973 , what you call in your work ``the long downturn ’’?
What mainly accounts for it is a deep , and lasting , decline of the rate of return on capital investment since the end of the 1960s .
The failure of the rate of profit to recover is all the more remarkable , in view of the huge drop - off in the growth of real wages over the period .
The main cause , though not the only cause , of the decline in the rate of profit has been a persistent tendency to overcapacity in global manufacturing industries .
What happened was that one after another new manufacturing powers entered the world market -- Germany and Japan , the northeast Asian newly indistrialising countries ( NICs ) , the South East Asian ``Tigers ' ' and , finally , the Chinese leviathan .
These later - developing economies produced the same goods that were already being produced by the earlier developers , only cheaper .
The result was too much supply compared to demand in one industry after another , and this forced down prices and in that way profits .
The corporations that experienced the squeeze on their profits did not , moreover , meekly leave their industries .
They tried to hold their place by falling back on their capacity for innovation , speeding up investment in new technologies .
But of course this only made overcapacity worse .
Due to the fall in their rate of return , capitalists were getting smaller surpluses from their investments .
They therefore had no choice but to slow down the growth of plant and equipment and employment .
At the same time , in order to restore profitability , they held down employees ' compensation , while governments reduced the growth of social expenditures .
But the consequence of all these cutbacks in spending has been a long - term problem of aggregate demand .
The persistent weakness of aggregate demand has been the immediate source of the economy ’s long term weakness .
The crisis was actually triggered by the bursting of the historic housing bubble , which had been expanding for a full decade .
What is your view of its significance ?
The housing bubble needs to be understood in relation to the succession of asset price bubbles that the economy has experienced since the middle 1990s , and especially role of the US Federal Reserve in nurturing those bubbles .
Since the start of the long downturn , state economic authorities have tried to cope with the problem of insufficient demand by encouraging the increase of borrowing , both public and private .
At first , they turned to state budget deficits , and in this way they did avoid really deep recessions .
But , as time went on , governments could get ever less growth from the same amount of borrowing .
In effect , in order stave off the sort of profound crises that historically have plagued the capitalist system , they had to accept a slide toward stagnation .
During the early 1990s , governments in the US and Europe , led by the US administration of US President Bill Clinton , famously tried to break their addiction to debt by moving together toward balanced budgets .
The idea was to let the free market govern the economy .
But , because profitability had still not recovered , the reduction in deficits delivered a big shock to demand , and helped bring about the worst recessions and slowest growth of the postwar era between 1991 and 1995 .
To get the economy expanding again , US authorities ended up adopting an approach that had been pioneered by Japan during the later 1980s .
By keeping interest rates low , the Federal Reserve made it easy to borrow so as to encourage investment in financial assets .
As asset prices soared , corporations and households experienced huge increases in their wealth , at least on paper .
They were therefore able to borrow on a titanic scale , vastly increase their investment and consumption , and in that way , drive the economy .
So , private deficits replaced public ones .
What might be called “ asset price Keynesianism ” replaced traditional Keynesianism .
We have therefore witnessed for the last dozen years or so the extraordinary spectacle of a world economy in which the continuation of capital accumulation has come literally to depend upon historic waves of speculation , carefully nurtured and rationalised by state policy makers and regulators -- first the historic stock market bubble of the later 1990s , then the housing and credit market bubbles from the early 2000s .
You were prophetic in forecasting the current crisis as well as the 2001 recession .
What is your outlook for the global economy ?
Will it worsen , or will it recover before the end of 2009 ?
Do you expect that the current crisis will be as severe as the Great Depression ?
The current crisis is more serious than the worst previous recession of the postwar period , between 1979 and 1982 , and could conceivably come to rival the Great Depression , though there is no way of really knowing .
Economic forecasters have underestimated how had bad it is because they have overestimated the strength of the real economy and failed to take into account the extent of its dependence upon a build up of debt that relied on asset price bubbles .
In the US , during the recent business cycle of the years 2001 - 2007 , GDP growth was by far the slowest of the postwar epoch .
There was no increase in private sector employment .
The increase in plant and equipment was about a third off the previous the postwar low .
Real wages were basically flat .
There was no increase in median family income for the first time since WWII .
Economic growth was driven entirely by personal consumption and residential investment , made possible by easy credit and rising house prices .
Economic performance was this weak , even despite the enormous stimulus from the housing bubble and the Bush administration 's huge federal deficits .
Housing by itself accounted for almost one - third of the growth of GDP and close to half of the increase in employment in the years 2001 - 2005 .
It was therefore to be expected that when the housing bubble burst , consumption and residential investment would fall , and the economy would plunge .
Many assert that the current crisis is a typical ``Minsky crisis '' not a Marxian one , arguing that that the financial speculation bubble bust has played the central role in this crisis .
How would you respond ?
I do n’t think it 's helpful to counterpose in that way the real and financial aspects of the crisis .
As I emphasised , it is a Marxian crisis , in that it finds its roots in a long - term fall and failure to recover of the rate of profit , which is the fundamental source of the extended slowdown of capital accumulation right into the present .
In 2001 , the rate of profit for US non-financial corporations was the lowest of the postwar period , except for 1980 .
Corporations therefore had no choice but to hold back on investment and employment , but this made the problem of aggregate demand worse , further darkening the business climate .
This is what accounts for the ultra - slow growth during the business cycle that just ended .
Nevertheless , to understand the current collapse , you have to demonstrate the connection between the weakness of the real economy and the financial meltdown .
The main link is the economy ’s ever - increasing dependence on borrowing to keep it turning over and the governments ' ever greater reliance on asset price run-ups to allow that borrowing to continue .
The basic condition for the housing and credit market bubbles was the perpetuation of low costs of borrowing .
The weakness of the world economy , especially after the crises of 1997 - 1998 and 2001 - 2002 , plus East Asian governments ’ huge purchases of dollars to keep their currencies down and US consumption growing , made for unusually low long - term interest rates .
At the same time , the US Fed kept short - term interest rates lower than at any time since the 1950s .
Because they could borrow so cheaply , banks were willing to extend loans to speculators , whose investments drove the price of assets of every type ever higher and the return on lending ( interest rates on bonds ) ever lower .
Symptomatically , housing prices soared and the yield in real terms on US treasury bonds plunged .
But because yields fell ever lower , institutions the world over that depended on returns from lending , had an ever more difficult time making sufficient profits .
Pensions funds and insurance companies were particularly hard hit , but hedge funds and investment banks were also affected .
These institutions were therefore all too ready to make massive investments in securities backed by highly dubious sub - prime mortgages because of the unusually high returns they offered , ignoring their unusually high risk .
In fact , they could not get enough of them .
Their purchases of mortgage - backed securities allowed mortgage originators to keep lending to ever less - qualified borrowers .
The housing bubble reached historic proportions , and the economic expansion was allowed to continue .
But , of course , this could not go on for very long .
When housing prices fell , the real economy went into recession and the financial sector experienced a meltdown , because both had depended for their dynamism on the housing bubble .
Today , the recession is making the meltdown worse because it is exacerbating the housing crisis .
The meltdown is intensifying the recession because it is making access to credit so difficult .
It is the mutually reinforcing interaction between the crisis in the real economy and financial sector that has made the downward slide so intractable for policy makers and the potential for catastrophe so evident .
Even if one grants that postwar capitalism entered a period of long downturn in the 1970s , it seems undeniable that the neoliberal capitalist offensive has prevented the worsening of the downswing since the 1980s .
If you mean by neoliberalism the turn to finance and deregulation , I do not see that it helped the economy .
But , if you mean by it , the stepped - up assault by employers and governments on workers ' wages , working conditions and the welfare state , there can be little doubt that it prevented the fall in the rate of profit from getting worse .
Even so , the employers ’ offensive did not wait until the so - called neoliberal era of the 1980s .
It began in the wake of the fall of profitability , starting in the early 1970s , along with Keynesianism .
It did not , moreover , result in recovery of the rate of profit and only further exacerbated the problem of aggregate demand .
The weakening of aggregate demand ultimately impelled economic authorities to turn to more powerful and dangerous forms of economic stimulus , the “ asset price Keynesianism ” that led to the current disaster .
Some have argued that a new paradigm of ``financialisation ’’ or ``finance - led capitalism ’’ has sustained a so - called ``Capital Resurgent ’’ ( Gerard Dumenil ) between the 1980s and the present .
What do you think of the thesis of ``financialisation ’’ or ``finance - led capitalism ’’?
The idea of a finance led - capitalism is a contradiction in terms , because , speaking generally -- there are significant exceptions , like consumer lending -- sustained financial profit making depends on sustained profit making in the real economy .
To respond to the fall in the rate of profit in the real economy , some governments , led by the US , encouraged a turn to finance by deregulating the financial sector .
But , because the real economy continued to languish , the main result of deregulation was to intensify competition in the financial sector , which made profit making more difficult and encouraged ever greater speculation and taking of risks .
Leading executives in investment banks and hedge funds were able to make fabulous fortunes , because their salaries depended on short - run profits .
They were able to secure temporarily high returns by expanding their firms ' assets / lending and increasing risk .
But this way of doing business , sooner or later , came at the expense of the executives own corporations ’ long - term financial health , leading , most spectacularly , the fall of Wall Street 's leading investment banks .
Every so - called financial expansion since the 1970s very quickly ended in a disastrous financial crisis and required a massive bail - out by the state .
This was true of the Third World lending boom of the 1970s and early 1980s ; the savings and loans run-up , the leveraged buyout mania , and the commercial real estate bubble of the 1980s ; the stockmarket bubble of the second half of the 1990s ; and of course the housing and credit market bubbles of the 2000s .
The financial sector appeared dynamic only because governments were prepared to go to any lengths to support it .
Keynesianism or statism seems poised to return as the new Zeitgeist .
What is your general assessment of resurgent Keynesianism or statism ?
Can it help to resolve , or at least , alleviate the current crisis ?
Governments today really have no choice but to turn to Keynesianism and the state to try to save the economy .
After all , the free market has shown itself totally incapable of preventing or coping with economic catastrophe , let alone securing stability and growth .
That ’s why the world 's political elites , who only yesterday were celebrating deregulated financial markets , are suddenly now all Keynesians .
But there is reason to doubt that Keynesianism in the sense of huge government deficits and easy credit to pump up demand can have the impact that many expect .
After all , during the past seven years , thanks to the borrowing and spending encouraged by the US Federal Reserve ’s housing bubble and the Bush administration 's budget deficits , we witnessed what was , in effect , probably the greatest Keynesian economic stimulus in peacetime history .
Yet , we got the weakest business cycle in the postwar epoch .
Today , the challenge is much greater .
As the housing bubble collapses and credit becomes harder to come by , households are cutting back on consumption and residential investment .
As a consequence , corporations are experiencing falling profits .
They are therefore cutting back on wages and laying - off workers at a rapid pace , detonating a downward spiral of declining demand and declining profitability .
Households had long counted on rising house prices to enable them to borrow more and to do their saving for them .
But now , because of the build - up of debt , they will have to reduce borrowing and increase saving at the very time that the economy most needs them to consume .
We can expect that much of the money that the government places in the hands of households will be saved , not spent .
Since Keynesianism could barely move the economy during the expansion , what can we expect from it in the worst recession since the 1930s ?
To have a significant effect on the economy , the Obama administration will likely have to contemplate a huge wave of direct or indirect government investment , in effect a form of state capitalism .
To actually accomplish this however would require overcoming enormous political and economic obstacles .
US political culture is enormously hostile to state enterprise .
At the same time , the level of expenditure and state indebtedness that would be required could threaten the US dollar .
Until now , East Asian governments have been happy to fund US external and government deficits , in order to sustain US consumption and their own exports .
But , with the crisis overtaking even China , these governments may lose the capacity to finance US deficits , especially as they grow to unprecedented size .
The truly terrifying prospect of a run on the dollar looms in the background .
What is your general assessment of the victory of Barack Obama in the last US presidential election ?
Do you think Obama is a ``lesser evil '' , compared to the Bush administration ?
Many regard Obama as a FDR of the 21st century .
Indeed , Obama promises a ``new New Deal ' ' .
Do you think the anti-capitalist progressives can give critical support to some of his ``new New Deal ' ' ?
The triumph of Obama in the election is to be welcomed .
A victory for John McCain would have been a victory for the Republican Party and given an enormous boost to the most reactionary forces on the US political scene .
It would have been seen as an endorsement of the Bush administration ’s hyper- militarism and imperialism , as well as its explicit agenda of eliminating what is left of the trade unions , the welfare state and environmental protection .
That said , Obama is -- like Roosevelt -- a centrist Democrat , who cannot be expected , on his own , to do much to defend the interests of the vast majority of working people , who will be subjected to an accelerating assault from corporations trying to make up for their collapsing profits by reducing employment , compensation and so forth .
Obama 's backed the titanic bailout of the financial sector , which represents perhaps the greatest robbery of the US taxpayer in history , especially as it came with no strings attached for the banks .
He also supported the bail - out of the auto industry , even though it is conditional on massive cuts in the compensation of auto workers .
The bottom line is that , like Roosevelt , Obama can be expected to take decisive action in defence of working people only if he is pushed by way of organised direct action from below .
The Roosevelt administration passed the main progressive legislation of the New Deal , including the Wagner Act and the Social Security Act , only after it was pressured to do so by a great wave of mass strikes .
We can expect the same from Obama .
According Rosa Luxemburg , and recently David Harvey , capitalism overcomes its tendency to crisis by way of geographical expansion .
According to Harvey , this is often facilitated by massive state investments in infrastructure , to back up private capital investment , often foreign direct investment .
Do you think that capitalism can find an exit from the current crisis , in Harvey ’s terminology , by way of a ``spatio - temporal - spatial fix ’’?
This is a complex issue .
I think , first of all , it 's true and critically important to say that geographical expansion has been essential to every great wave of capital accumulation .
You might say that growth of the size of the labour force and growth of the system ’s geographical space are the sine qua non , the essentials , for capitalist growth .
The postwar boom is a good example , as it featured spectacular expansions of capital into the US south and southwest and into war - torn western Europe and Japan .
Investment by US corporations played a critical role , not only in the US but in western Europe in this epoch .
Without question , this expansion of the labour force and the capitalist geographical arena was indispensable for the high profit rates that made the postwar boom so dynamic .
From a Marxist standpoint , this was a classical wave of capital accumulation and , necessarily , entailed both the sucking in of huge masses of labour from outside the system , especially from the pre-capitalist countryside in Germany and Japan , and the incorporation or re-incorporation of additional geographical space on an a huge scale .
Nevertheless , I think that by and large the pattern of the long downturn , since the late 1960s and early 1970s , has been different .
It is true that capital responded to falling profitability by further expansion outward , seeking to combine advanced techniques with cheap labour .
East Asia is of course the fundamental case , and unquestionably represents a world - historical moment , a fundamental transformation , for capitalism .
But , though expansion into East Asia represented a response to falling profitability , it has not , I think , constituted a satisfactory solution .
This is because , at the end of the day , the new manufacturing production that has emerged so spectacularly in East Asia is to a great extent duplicating the manufacturing production already taking place elsewhere , though taking place more cheaply .
The problem is on a system - wide scale , it 's more exacerbating than resolving the problem of overcapacity .
In other words , globalisation has been a response to falling profitability , but because its new industries are not , basically , complementary for the world division of labour , but redundant , you have had a continuation of the problem of profitability .
The bottom line , I think , is that to actually resolve the problem of profitability that has so long plagued the system -- slowing capital accumulation and calling forth ever greater levels of borrowing to sustain stability -- the system requires the crisis that has so long been postponed .
Because the problem is overcapacity , massively exacerbated by the build - up of debt , what is still required is , as in the classical vision , a shake out from the system of high - cost , low - profit firms , the subsequent cheapening of means of production , and the reduction of the price of labour .
It ’s by way of crisis that , historically , capitalism has restored the rate of profit and established the necessary conditions for more dynamic capital accumulation .
During the postwar period , crisis has been warded off , but the cost has been a failure to revive profitability leading to worsening stagnation .
The current crisis is about that shakeout that never happened .
So you think that only the crisis can resolve the crisis ?
That 's a classical Marxian answer .
I think that that is probably the case .
The analogy would be this .
At first , in the early 1930s , the New Deal and Keynesianism were ineffective .
In fact , through the length of the 1930s , there was a failure to establish the conditions for a new boom , as was demonstrated when the economy fell back into the deep recession of 1937 - 1938 .
But , eventually , as a result of the long crisis in the 1930s , you shook out the high cost , low profit means of production , creating the basic conditions for high rates of profit .
So , by the end of the 1930s , you could say that the potential rate of profit was high and all that was missing was a shock to demand .
That demand was provided of course by the massive spending on armaments for World War II .
So , during the war , you got high rates of profit and those high rates of profit provided the necessary condition for the postwar boom .
But I do n't think that Keynesian deficits could have worked even if they had been tried in 1933 , because you needed , in Marxian terms , a system - cleansing crisis first .
Do you think that the current crisis will lead to a challenge to US hegemony ?
World - system theorists , like Immanuel Wallerstein ... are arguing that the hegemony of US imperialism is declining .
This is again a very complex question .
Perhaps I am mistaken , but I think that many of those who believe that there has been a decline in US hegemony basically view US hegemony as mainly an expression of US geopolitical power and , in the end , US force .
From this standpoint , it 's mainly US dominance that makes for US leadership , it 's US power over and against other countries that keeps the US on top .
I do n't see US hegemony that way .
I see the elites of the world , especially the elites of the capitalist core broadly conceived , as being very happy with US hegemony because what it means for them is that the US assumes the role and the cost of world policemen .
This is true , I think , of the elites even of most poor countries today .
What is the goal of the US world policeman ?
It 's not to attack other countries .
Mainly , it 's to keep social order on a world scale , to create stable conditions for global capital accumulation .
It 's main purpose is to wipe out any popular challenges to capitalism , to support the existing structures of class relations .
For most of the postwar period , there were nationalist - statist challenges , especially from below , to the free rein of capital .
They unquestionably were met by the most brutal US force , the most naked expressions of US domination .
Although within the core there was US hegemony , outside of it there was dominance .
But , with the fall of the Soviet Union , and China and Vietnam taking the capitalist road , and the defeat of national liberation movements in places like southern Africa and Central America , resistance to capital in the developing world was very much weakened , at least for the time being .
So , today , the governments and elites not only of western and eastern Europe , Japan and South Korea , but also Brazil , India and China -- most any place you can name -- would prefer the continuation of US hegemony .
US hegemony will fall not because of the rise of a another power capable of contending for world domination .
Above all , China prefers US hegemony .
The US is not planning to attack China and , until now , the US has kept its market wide open to Chinese exports .
With the US providing the role of world policeman and insuring ever freer trade and capital movements , China has been allowed to compete in terms of cost of production , on an equal playing field , and this has been incredibly beneficial to China -- it could n't be better .
Can the US continue its hegemony in the current crisis ?
This is a much harder question .
But I think that , in the first instance , the answer is yes .
The world 's elites want more than anything to sustain the current globalising order , and the US is key to that .
None of the world 's elites are trying to exploit the crisis and the United States ' enormous economic problems , to challenge US hegemony .
China keeps saying , “ We 're not going to continue to pay for the US to continue its profligate ways ' ' , referring to the manner China covered record - breaking US current account deficits during the past decade and to the titanic US budget deficits now being created .
But , do you think China has now cut the US off ?
Not at all .
China is still pouring as much money as it can into the US to try to keep the US economy going , so that China can keep developing the way it did .
But , of course what is desired is not always possible .
The depth of the Chinese crisis may be so great that it can no longer afford to finance US deficits .
Or , the assumption of ever greater US deficits and printing of money by the Federal Reserve could lead to the collapse of the dollar , detonating true catastrophe .
In either case , all bets are off .
If those things happened , there would have to be a construction of a new order .
But , under conditions of deep crisis that would be extremely difficult .
Indeed , under such conditions , the US , as well as other states , could easily turn to protection , nationalism , and even war .
I think , as of this moment , the elites of the world still are trying to avoid this -- they are not ready for it .
What they want to is to keep markets open , keep trade open .
This is because they understand that the last time states resorted to protectionism to solve the problem was at the time of the Great Depression , and this made the depression way worse , because in effect , when some states started to protect , everybody moved to protection , and the world market closed down .
Next , of course , came militarism and war .
The closing of world markets would obviously be disastrous today , so elites and governments are doing their very best to prevent a protectionist , statist , nationalist , militarist outcome .
But politics is not just an expression of what the elites want , and what elites want changes over time .
Elites are , moreover , generally divided and politics has autonomy .
So , for example , it can hardly be ruled out that , if the crisis gets very bad -- which would not at this point be a big surprise -- you would see a return of far - right politics , a politics of protectionism , militarism , anti-immigration , nationalism .
This sort of politics not only could have broad popular appeal .
Growing sections of business might find it the only way out , as they see their markets collapse , the system in depression , see a need for protection from competition and state subsidies of demand by way of military spending .
This was , of course , the response that prevailed in much of Europe and Japan during the crisis of the interwar period .
Today , the right wing is on its heels , because of the failures of the Bush administration and because of the crisis .
But , if the Obama administration is unable to counter the economic collapse , the right could easily come back , especially because the Democrats are really offering no ideological alternative .
You spoke about a potential crisis in China .
What do you think of the current state of Chinese economy ?
I think the Chinese crisis is going to be a lot worse than people expect , and this is for two main reasons .
The first is that the US crisis , and the global crisis more generally , is much more serious than people expected , and in the last analysis , the fate of the Chinese economy is inextricably dependent on the fate of the US economy , the global economy .
This is not only because China has depended to such a great extent on exports to the US market .
It is also because most of the rest of the world is also so dependent on the US , and that especially includes Europe .
If I 'm not mistaken , Europe recently became China 's biggest export market .
But , as the crisis originating in the US brings down Europe , Europe 's market for Chinese goods will also contract .
So , the situation for China is much worse than what people expect , because the economic crisis is much worse than people expected .
Second , in people 's enthusiasm for what has been China 's truly a spectacular economic growth , they have ignored the role of bubbles in driving the China 's economy .
China has grown , basically by way of exports , and particularly a growing trade surplus with the US .
Because of this surplus , the Chinese government has had to take political steps to keep the Chinese currency down and Chinese manufacturing competitive .
Specifically , it has bought up US dollar - denominated assets on a titanic scale by printing titanic amounts of the renminbi , the Chinese currency .
But the result has been to inject huge amounts of money into the Chinese economy , making for ever easier credit over a long period .
On the one hand , enterprises and local governments have used this easy credit to finance massive investment .
But , this has made for ever greater overcapacity .
On the other hand , they have used the easy credit to buy land , houses , shares and other sorts of financial assets .
But this has made for massive asset price bubbles , which have played a part , as in the US , in allowing for more borrowing and spending .
As the Chinese bubbles burst , the depth of the overcapacity will be made clear .
As the Chinese bubbles burst , you will also have , as across much of the rest of the world , a huge hit to consumer demand and disruptive financial crisis .
So , the bottom line is , the Chinese crisis is very serious , and could make the global crisis much more severe .
So you think the capitalist logic of overproduction is also applied to China ?
Yes , just like in South Korea and much of East Asia in later the 1990s .
It 's not that dissimilar .
The only thing that has n't happened yet is the kind of revaluation of the currency that really killed the South Korean manufacturing expansion .
The Chinese government is doing everything to avoid that .
Then you do not agree with the characterisation of Chinese society as a kind of ``non- capitalist market economy '' ?
Not at all .
So you think China is currently capitalist ?
I think it 's fully capitalist .
You might say that China had a market non-capitalist economy maybe through the 1980s , when it had very impressive growth by means of the town and village enterprises .
The town and village enterprises were publicly owned , owned by local governments , but operated on a market basis .
That economic form , you might say , initiated the transition to capitalism .
So perhaps up to maybe the early 1990s , it was still a kind of non-capitalist market society , especially because there was still such a big industrial sector owned and planned by the central state .
But , from that point on , there was a transition to capitalism , which has certainly by now been completed .
What do you think of the severity of the coming South Korean economic crisis ?
Do you think it could be more severe than the IMF crisis of 1997 - 1998 ?
In order to cope with the coming crisis , the Lee Myung - bak government is now reviving Park Chung - Hee style state - led investment for the construction of huge social infrastructure , especially Korean peninsula 's ``Great Canal ’’ , while copying Obama 's green - growth policies .
However , Lee Myung - bak 's government still tries to stick to the neoliberal deregulation policies of the post -1997 crisis period , especially by turning to the US - Korea Free Trade Agreement .
You might call this a hybrid approach , combining what seems to be an anachronist return to a Park Chung - Hee style state - led method of development with contemporary neoliberalism .
Will it be effective in combating or alleviating the coming crisis ?
I 'm doubtful that it will be effective .
This is not necessarily because it represents a throwback to Park 's state - led organised capitalism or because it embraces neoliberalism .
It is because , whatever its internal form , it continues to depend on globalisation at a time when the global crisis is bringing about an extraordinary contraction of the world market .
We were just talking about China , and I was arguing that China is likely to be in serious trouble .
But , China has low wages , potentially a huge domestic market , so over time it could conceivably have a better shot than South Korea of confronting the crisis , though I 'm far from sure about this .
South Korea , I think , will be hard hit .
It was hard hit in 1997 - 1998 , but was saved by the US stockmarket bubble and the resulting growth of US borrowing , spending and imports .
But , when the US stockmarket bubble burst in 2000 - 2002 , South Korea went into what promised to be an ever more serious crisis than 1997 - 1998 .
Nevertheless , the US housing bubble came to the rescue of South Korea during the recent period .
But , now the US bubble , the second US bubble , has collapsed , and there 's no third bubble to get South Korea out of the current crisis .
It 's not necessarily because South Korea is doing the wrong thing .
It 's because I do n't think there 's going to be an easy way out for any part of what has become a truly global , interdependent capitalist system .
So what you are saying is that external environment is far worse than ever before ?
That 's the main point .
What then are the urgent tasks of progressives in South Korea ?
South Korean progressives are very critical of Lee Myung - bak .
They usually support the growth of the welfare state and redistribution of income as an alternative to Lee 's project of investing in Canal construction , of big social overhead capital .
This is the hot issue in South Korean society today .
South Korean progressives point out that although Lee Myung - bak talks about green growth , his construction project would destroy whole environments .
Do you agree with them ?
Of course , we should oppose such ecologically disastrous projects .
Do you think that building a Swedish - type welfare state would be the reasonable strategy for South Korean progressives in the midst of the economic crisis ?
I think the most important thing South Korean progressives could do would be to restrengthen the organisations of Korean labour .
Only by rebuilding the South Korean working - class movement could the left build the power that it needs to win whatever demands it is advocating .
The only way that working people can really develop their power is through building new organisations in the course of struggle and , it 's only in the course of struggle , that they are likely to come to a progressive politics , or indeed decide what a progressive politics actually should be at this moment .
I think the best way to forge a left political response today is to help the people most affected to gain the organisation and power to decide what 's collectively in their interests .
So , rather than try to figure out now , from above in a technocratic way , what 's the best answer , the key for the left is to catalyse the reconstitution of the power of working people .
The South Korean labour movement has obviously been weakened a great deal since the crisis of 1997 - 1998 .
At a minimum , the priority for progressives is to do what they can to improve the environment for labour organising , for restrengthening the trade unions right now .
That goes for everywhere around the world .
That 's the key objective .
Without the revival of working - class power , the left will quickly find that most issues of government policy are truly academic .
I mean if the left is to affect state policy , there must be a change , a big change , in the balance of class power .
Do you expect that there will be an opening for progressives in a world with recent failures of neoliberalism ?
The defeat of neoliberalism is definitely creating major opportunities that the left did not have before .
Neoliberalism never much appealed to large parts of the population .
Working people never identified with free markets , free finance and all that .
But I think that large sections of the population were convinced that this was the only alternative , they were convinced of TINA [ there is no alternative ] .
But , now the crisis has revealed the total bankruptcy of the neoliberal mode of economic organisation , and you can already see the change .
It has been very powerfully manifested in the opposition by US working people to the bail - outs for the banks and financial sector .
What they are saying today is that , “ We are told that saving the financial institutions , the financial markets , is the key to restoring the economy , prosperity .
But we do n't believe it .
We do n't want any more of money going to these people who are just robbing us . ”
So there is a big vacuum ideologically .
Thus there is a big opening for left ideas .
The problem is that there is very little organisation of working people , let alone any political expression .
So one can say there is this very big opportunity created by the change in the political environment , or the ideological climate , but that by itself is not going to provide a progressive outcome .
So , again , the top priority for progressives -- for any left activists -- where they should be active is in trying to revive the organisations of working people .
Without the re-creation of working class power , few progressive gains will be possible , and the only way to recreate that power is by way of mobilisation for direct action .
Only through working people taking action , collectively and en masse , will they be able to create the organisation and amass the power necessary to provide the social basis , so to speak , for a transformation of their own consciousness , for political radicalisation .

NORMA PERCY has ways of making you talk .
Persuasiveness served the American - born , London - based television producer well in the past , with such films as “ The Death of Yugoslavia ” and “ Israel and the Arabs : Elusive Peace ” .
She has done it again in her newest venture , a three - part series on Iran 's tricky relationship with America and Europe .
AFP
The man who started it all
“ Iran and the West ” will be broadcast in Britain by the BBC , starting on February 7th , although it is not clear yet whether it will also be shown on the corporation 's new Persian TV channel , which was launched last month .
The series has been sold in 13 countries and will be aired in the coming weeks in America , Japan , Canada , Australia and much of western Europe .
Ms Percy 's model is to persuade the main participants — presidents , foreign ministers , generals and close advisers — to describe what they did at crucial moments of political crisis .
The key lies in obtaining the first interviews .
After that , few want to be left out .
The main players have their say and viewers get a good idea of how those involved come to make complex decisions about foreign policy and realpolitik and then undo the damage they cause .
Three years in the making and finished just days before the 30th anniversary of Ayatollah Khomeini 's return from exile to Tehran on February 1st ( see article ) , “ Iran and the West ” shows how Khomeini changed the world by taking Iran and making it the inspiration for a new and uncompromising strand of Islam .
It conveys the strains , for both Iran and America , of dealing with the daily tumult of the Islamic revolution and the long siege of the American embassy in Tehran .
And it goes on to analyse the fallout from the Iran - Iraq war , the crucial role Iran played in creating Hizbullah , the Shiite militia 's wrongdoings in Lebanon , as well as Iran 's more recent meddling in Iraq and its ambitions to join the small club of nuclear nations .
By the mid-1980s the hatred between Iran and the West was so strong that the normal rules governing how states behave towards each other were set aside .
Europe and America armed Iran 's foe , Saddam Hussein , and turned a blind eye when he used chemical weapons on Iranian troops as well his own people .
Yet , far from being an anti-Iranian polemic , “ Iran and the West ” chronicles three decades of mistakes , misunderstandings and missed opportunities , especially in the relationship with America .
Two long interviews — with Hashemi Rafsanjani , Iran 's reformist president from 1989 until 1997 , and his successor , Muhammad Khatami — obtained at the eleventh hour and in the face of disapproval from the Iranian Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance , add depth and crucial detail to a narrative that could so easily have been too Western .
The film highlights several vital events .
Two Iranian revolutionary guards describe organising the takeover of the American embassy and confirm what others maintain , that , contrary to rumour , the current president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , refused to be involved in the siege .
Sheikh Subhi al - Tufeyli , Hizbullah 's first secretary - general , recounts how the release of three French hostages from Lebanon in 1988 had been delayed for two years at the behest of the French right - wing opposition parties who wanted to destabilise President François Mitterrand 's Socialist Party and help Jacques Chirac become prime minister .
Vladimir Putin , then Russia 's president , describes how , after the assassination of Ahmad Shah Massoud , an Afghan warlord , in early September 2001 , he telephoned the American president , George Bush , to warn him that al - Qaeda was planning “ something big ” .
The attack on the twin towers happened the next day .

“ We asked younger people about texting while driving ; they told us the driving distracted them from texting . ”
The speaker was Larry Burns , head of R&D for General Motors , at the introduction of Project Puma , the result of a joint effort between GM and Segway to develop a two - wheeled , two - seat , gyroscopically stabilized electric urban vehicle that would run autonomously and avoid collisions by communicating with other vehicles and the surrounding infrastructure .
Part of Project Puma ’s new way of looking at transportation includes a dock for your personal communications device — they tried to avoid saying “ iPhone ” — which would provide destination data to the vehicle .
Meanwhile , the passengers could watch a movie or listen to music from those same devices .
When they 're not texting , anyway .
Nearly half of 1,000 drivers 18 to 24 years old who were interviewed by FindLaw.com admitted that they had texted or sent e-mail on their mobile phone while driving .
Currently , just three states -- Minnesota , New Jersey , and Washington -- completely ban text messaging for all drivers .
More are expected to follow .

â€ œFor Austria , the actual crisis is yet to come .
The decline of the eastern European economy will hit Austria in 2009 ″ .
Peter Eigner , Professor of economic history at the University of Viennaâ€ 
The yield difference , or spread , between 10 - year Austrian securities and benchmark German bunds has been rising substantially of late , and hit 137 points on Feb. 18 , the widest yet recorded ( see chart below ) .
At the same time Austria now has a higher default risk than those Mediterranean “ laggards ” Italy , Portugal and Spain , at least according to credit - default swap prices as quoted by CMA Datavision .
Austrian swaps were trading at 253.3 basis points on March 3 , compared with 17.5 points 12 months ago .
That means it costs 253,300 euros a year to protect 10 million euros from default for five years .
The reason for this sharp spike in spreads is , of course , the heavy exposure the Austrian banking system has to the risk of defaults in the East .
Austriaâ€™s banks have about 201 billion euros ( $ 254 billion ) oustanding in loans in Eastern Europe , equal to about 71 percent of gross domestic product , according to data from the Bank for International Settlements .
Shares of Austriaâ€™s Erste Group Bank , which made more than two - thirds of its profit from emerging European economies in 2008 , and Raiffeisen International Bank - Holding AG , which operates only in the region , have both dropped more than 85 percent from their peaks .
To put this in perspective , Austriaâ€™s banks could withstand losses of up to 31 billion euros on their outstanding loans , according to stress testing carried out last month by Austriaâ€™s central bank .
But what if the defualt figure rises beyond this ?
Now all these numbers have been causing some controversy of late ( see Izabella Kaminska ’s piece in FT Alphaville ) and Erik Berglof , Chief Economist at the European Bank for Regional Development has taken issue with some of those who have expressed concern about the situation , specifically referring to the widely quoted BIS figure of $ 1,700bn , ( cited among others Morgan Stanley ’s Stephen Jen , Yours Truly here on Afoe , and The Anthropologist ’s Grandson Ambrose Evans Pritchard in the Daily Telegraph ) .
In particular , Berglof asks the following question :
The $ 1,700bn , which is taken from Bank for International Settlements statistics , represents the total claims of foreign banks and their affiliates on eastern Europe .
Western banks own some 80 per cent of the regionâ€™s banking sector .
The BIS figure therefore simply reports the regionâ€™s bank balance sheets .
At $ 18,000 bn the equivalent figure for western Europe is more than 10 times higher â€ ” should we be concerned ?
My answer is , yes , we should be concerned , and more importantly , Austria ’s citizen ’s should .
Let ’s look at what Berglof says next :
A much better measure of refinancing need is short - term external debt owed by the regionâ€™s banking sectors to foreign creditors .
According to central bank data , this is about $ 200 bn for all of central and eastern europe .
Thinking about his argument , a lot of things make sense to me , in a sort of sudden flash of lightening .
You see , we are talking about two different things here , one is the level of exposure to default on the loans , not sovereign default , but default by households and companies as the economies contract , and as the currencies slide ( or , in the case of the Baltics and Bulgaria , internal deflation is carried out ) , and the other is the issue of speculative attacks on currencies and reserves due to the gap in the current account deficits .
But this would be the point , we are not dealing here with a 1960s type balance of payments crisis ( although you would n’t know that from looking at the loan measures the EU has been taking , or from the language it is using which constantly refers to them as balance of payments loans ) .
What we actually have on our hands , however , is not a simple balance of payments crisis , but rather a regional deleveraging process , as economies which have expanded well beyond their short term capacity level of output now contract sharply , in many cases with a boom bust dynamic .
This is inevitably going to produce a steady stream of defaults over the next two to three years .
One extaimate has been in the ( worst case scenario ) context of Ukraine that defaults may rise as high as 60 % , but lets just imagine they rise above 20 % – that would be around a 40 billion bill for Austria , and a 350 billion euro bill for Western Banks in the Context of Eastern Europe as a whole .
And if we get a worst case scenario of 40 % default , then you just double those numbers .
Erste Bank have also today joined the fray , with analysts Juraj Kotian and Rainer Singer publishing a new research report today .
Erste said that statistics from the Bank for International Settlements had been misinterpreted .
The analysts cited the â€œalarming newsâ€ that eastern Europe has borrowed $ 1.7 trillion abroad and has to roll - over or repay $ 400 billion this year .
They compared that with Germanyâ€™s foreign borrowings of $ 2.3 trillion , Britainâ €™s figure of $ 4.5 trillion and Belgiumâ€™s need to repay or roll - over $ 375 billion this year .
The point about the UK is of course , very well made ( although it does n’t make East Europe ’s position any better to know that things in the UK are bad ) , however Germany is a current account surplus country , so it is hard to see what exactly the relevance of the point they are making as regards Germany is .
Unless , of course , they are suggesting that those banks who have leant to German customers are running a stronger default risk than those who have leant to Poland .
They should , of course , have mentioned Spain or Greece , where the current account deficits have been massive , and foreign exposure is large , although since the risks of what has been happening in Spain and Greece are already well - known , it would hardly have helped their case .
The difference is , of course , that Spain and Greece are in the Eurozone , which is where I am arguing the Eastern countries should now be , and I find it hard to see that these Erste analysts are even serving their own interests by serving up the kind of argument they have been serving up .
What we need to see is stress testing on possible default rates for the Eastern loans , and on various scenarios , over the next 5 years .
They also add this which seems to me to be extraordinarily spurious :
Austrian banks have granted loans of $ 318 billion , or 73 percent of the Alpine nationâ€™s gross domestic product to eastern Europe , the report said .
They have also borrowed $ 143 billion , or 33 percent of GDP , from the region , it added .
That makes the banksâ€™ net debt equivalent to 40 percent of GDP .
I mean , are they suggesting that the default risk inside Austria is the same as the default risk externally , if they are this is the first time I have heard such a suggestion .
The problem in Austria is not likely to be the debt which Austrians have to pay externally ( all those strange Swiss Franc mortagages , which have to have been a mistake , but still ) , but the none repayment of debts elsewhere which result in a ballooning of Austrian government debt which currently equals 62.3 percent of its GDP .
Also Austria has a current - account surplus of almost 9 billion euros .
Returning to the main theme , of course no one at this point has any accurate idea of the real level of default we are going to see in the East , or of the posterior recovery rate on the assets , but it does n’t help restore confidence if leading authorities essentially address the secondary issue and not the primary one .
That presumeably is why Austrian spreads have risen and continue to rise .
It is also why Eastern Europe needs a collective solution to its problems , and it needs one now .
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Microsoft ’s chief executive said on Monday he was ‘ very surprised ’ by Oracle Corp ’s plans to buy Sun Microsystems Inc .
“ I just learnt it ... I need to think about it .
I am very surprised , ” Steve Ballmer told Reuters in Moscow .
Earlier on Monday Oracle unveiled a plan to buy Sun for more than $ 7 billion , after the high - end computer server and software maker ’s talks with IBM fell apart .
Microsoft Corp is itself talking to Yahoo Inc on an Internet search advertising partnership which could help it turn around its money - losing online business and challenge rival Google ’s dominant position .
Ballmer told a news conference in Moscow it was the right time to invest in that business .
“ We are clearly losing money .
We will make money some day .
Now it is the right time to invest . ”
“ I think that advertising will be the most important way for us to make money in the online business , search , in display advertising , and partnership with Facebook is a part of that . ”
Last year Microsoft took a $ 240 million stake in internet social network Facebook , beating out Google and expanding its advertising partnership with the social networking company .
Analysts say the potential deal with Yahoo may help it turn around its online business and challenge Google ’s dominant and growing share of the U.S. search market .
Ballmer also said the economic crisis was the right time to invest in innovations , adding Microsoft will spend a total of $ 9 billion on research and development this year .
RUSSIA INVESTMENT
He said Microsoft planned to invest 10 billion roubles ( $ 299 million ) in projects in Russia in the next three years to support small businesses and promote computer literacy .
The initiatives range from projects to increase computer literacy to the creation of innovation and research facilities , Ballmer said , adding they aimed to help Russia respond to the current economic crisis and build sustainable economic growth .
“ We view Russia not only as a market of great strategic importance for Microsoft but also as an important center for future innovation , entrepreneurship and economic growth ... despite the challenges we face I am extremely optimistic about the long - term future , ” Ballmer said .
( $ 1=33.46 roubles )
In the end , it was a compromise .
There have always been those who believed that comparing the stars of men's professional hockey to the greatest players in the women 's game was too difficult , too unwieldy and simply pointless .
Maybe they were right .
Given the different developmental stages of the men's game versus the women's , comparing Hayley Wickenheiser to Alex Ovechkin is like comparing Tris Speaker to Derek Jeter .
So after dithering for a long time , probably too long , the Hockey Hall of Fame settled on a compromise .
Starting next year , they 'll still enshrine four men every year , but they 'll also enshrine up to two women .
Not perfect .
There will be those who argue that this still does n't pay due respect to the women 's game because , in effect , it makes them second - class citizens in the hall , admitted in a separate category from " real " players .
There 's some truth to that .
But there were also those in the game who believed that women should never be voted in , or that if they ever were , it should be as builders .
You know , with a nice pat on the head and a Participaction badge .
That would have been nearly as disgraceful as excluding women altogether .
So , starting in 2010 , the hall wo n't make itself choose between NHL superstars and the top women 's players .
For 2009 , to illustrate how difficult it would be to do so , the likes of Cammi Granato or Angela James would have had to compete for one of the four Honoured Member slots against former NHL luminaries Steve Yzerman , Luc Robitaille , Brian Leetch , Doug Gilmour , Dino Ciccarelli and Brett Hull .
That was a fight they were never going to win .
Instead , we know the first two women will be inducted next year – you'd think the big brains at the HHOF would sense the need for a female on the prestigious selection committee to help out in this process , but they do n't – and that will be a very , very good day for women 's hockey and the sport itself .
So , a toast to the women who have waited for too long for this to happen .
On her civic rounds , Hazel McCallion should be feeling wonderful about the sport she helped pioneer before becoming Her Worship .
She 'll be joined in that by a lot of other women .
It 's not clear why this happened now , although it had to be embarrassing to the Hall of Fame last year when the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame inducted Granato , and the International Ice Hockey Hall of Fame enshrined James , Granato and Geraldine Heaney .
When those two august bodies opened their doors to women , it made the Toronto - based HHOF look like it was been run by a bunch of rubes , good old boys with a secret handshake and no accountability to the game beyond keeping their pals happy .
All of which , to some degree , has always been the case .
The Hockey Hall of Fame , for example , did once upon a time honour the likes of Harold Ballard , inducted Bob Pulford as a viable player , let Gil Stein gerrymander his way in and probably still does n't have enough European players on the big board as Honoured Members .
But the movement to relent and allow women in started a couple of years ago , and finally public momentum was simply too strong for the HHOF to resist .
They probably wo n't tell you that .
They 'll insist they were just taking their time getting the process fine - tuned .
Whatever .
It no longer matters .
There is now a degree of fairness in hockey 's greatest institution that did n't exist last week , and that 's meaningful in a sport that has great difficulty at times with the concept of evolution .
With yesterday 's announcement , some will say , " It 's about time . "
Here , it 's simply , " Congratulations and well done . "
Sources : GOP leaders split on budget " blueprint "
House Minority Whip Eric Cantor ( R - Va. ) and Rep. Paul Ryan ( R - Wisc. ) raised objections to an abbreviated alternative budget " blueprint " released today -- but were told by House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) they needed to back the plan , according to several Republican sources .
The argument , coming a week before the full House and Senate are scheduled to vote on the budget , underscores the minority party 's woes in a mounting unified opposition to President Obama 's $ 3.6 trillion FY2010 budget proposal .
Ryan , the ranking Republican on the budget committee , plans to introduce a detailed substitute amendment for the Democrats ' spending plan next Wednesday -- and still intends to do so .
But he and Cantor were reportedly told by Boehner and Republican Conference Chairman Mike Pence ( R - Ind . ) they needed to move more quickly to counter Democrats ' charge they were becoming the " Party of No , " according to House GOP staffers .
The 19 - page document , prepared by Pence 's office , was distributed two days after President Obama criticized Republicans for trashing his detail - crammed 142 - page budget outline without producing a credible alternative .
“ In his egocentric rush to get on camera , Mike Pence threw the rest of the Conference under the bus , specifically Paul Ryan , whose staff has been working night and day for weeks to develop a substantive budget plan , " said a GOP aide heavily involved in budget strategy .
" I hope his camera time was gratifying enough to justify erasing the weeks of hard work by dozens of Republicans to put forth serious ideas , " the person added .
" It 's categorically untrue , " said Pence spokesman Matt Lloyd .
" Cantor as well as Ryan and the rest of the leadership have been part of this process for weeks .
They not only signed off on it , but their staffs helped edit it . "
Ryan told POLITICO that he did n't feel thrown under any buses and downplayed the disagreement .
" The problem is that somewhere along the line , someone got the mistaken impression that we were going to roll out a budget alternative today , " he said .
" What we all signed off on was a preview — the real [ alternative ] is coming next week . "
Still , when he was asked what purpose today 's preview served , Ryan directed me to Pence 's office : " You 've got to ask the conference this question , I ca n't answer that question . "
The leadership appeared united a press conference this afternoon , with Pence and Boehner holding copies of blue - jacketed budget outline as photographers clicked away .
But no sooner were copies distributed , than Democrats began blasting away , gleefully pointing to its lack of specific numbers -- except for a proposal to cut tax rates on people earning $ 100,000 from over 20 percent to 10 percent .
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs dismissed it with a joke saying the swirling pattern on the cover reminded him of a windmill .
" It took me several minutes to read it , " Gibbs quipped , saying Obama was " absolutely " disappointed it did n't include more details .
" I think the ' party of no ' has become the party of no new ideas , " he added .
Speaking on MSNBC , Pence promised greater detail " in a couple of days , adding , " " This is the broad outline today . "
Cantor and Ryan were reportedly " embarrassed " by the document -- believing it was better to absorb a week of hits from Democrats than to be slammed for failing to produce a thoughtful and detailed alternative .
The goal , aides say , was to make Obama 's team eat their words by producing a " killer " alternative with far less spending and greater tax cuts .

There ’s no doubt that 2008 was Tina Fey ’s big year .
She had a hit movie ( Baby Mama ) , her show “ 30 Rock ” finally started getting recognized as more than an underground cult favorite , and her impression of Sarah Palin garnered her old stomping ground , Saturday Night Live , its highest ratings in years .
Tina is Vanity Fair ’s cover girl for the January issue , and the self - proclaimed nerd is turning up the glamour in a leggy , pinup - inspired photo shoot .
She also finally reveals how she got that trademark scar on her cheek .
People have been asking her about it for years and she ’s always refused to talk about it .
In this interview , Tina ’s husband , Jeff Richmond , spills the beans .
Liz Lemon favors her right side .
That ’s because a faint scar runs across Tina Fey ’s left cheek , the result of a violent cutting attack by a stranger when Fey was five .
Her husband says , “ It was in , like , the front yard of her house , and somebody who just came up , and she just thought somebody marked her with a pen . ”
You can hardly see the scar in person .
But I agree with Richmond that it makes
Fey more lovely , like a hint of Marlene Dietrich noir glamour in a Preston Sturges heroine .
“ That scar was fascinating to me , ” Richmond recalls .
“ This is somebody who , no matter what it was , has gone through something .
And I think it really informs the way she thinks about her life .
When you have that kind of thing happen to you , that makes you scared of certain things , that makes you frightened of different things , your comedy comes out in a different kind of way , and it also makes you feel for people . ”
I wonder how the scar affected Fey in high school .
“ She was n’t Rocky Dennis developing a sense of humor because of her looks , like in Mask , ” says Damian Holbrook , laughing .
Liz Lemon ’s blustery Republican boss , Jack Donaghy , played with comic genius by Alec Baldwin , tells Lemon , “ I do n’t know what happened in your life that caused you to develop a sense of humor as a coping mechanism .
Maybe it was some sort of brace or corrective boot you wore during childhood , but in any case I ’m glad you ’re on my team . ”
The article also chronicles Tina ’s early days as a writer on SNL , when she was a mousy , quiet person who “ wore ski hats and ate junk food , ” until finally she lost 30 pounds and got out from behind the writer ’s desk to start performing on the show .
Her true vice is cupcakes .
I ’ve brought her a box , one frosted with the face of Sarah Palin .
She chooses that one , which is bigger , joking that it ’s O.K. if she gains weight before her Annie Leibovitz photo shoot in a few days , because “ Annie ’s going to photograph my soul , right ? ”
When it comes to her looks , she ’s both forgiving and self - deprecating .
“ The most I ’ve changed pictures out of vanity was to edit around any shot where you can see my butt , ” she says .
“ I like to look goofy , but I also do n’t want to get canceled because of my big old butt . ”
Frowning and rubbing the lines between her eyes , she adds that she might also tell the 30 Rock postproduction team , “ ‘ Can you digitally take this out ? ’
Because I do n’t have Botox or anything . ”
Fey ’s friend Kay Cannon , a 30 Rock writer , says that Tina has remained self - deprecating even as she has glammed up .
“ She ’ll always see herself as that other , the thing she came from . ”
[ From Vanity Fair ]
I ’ve been rooting for Tina since her days on SNL .
She ’s smart , funny and deserves all the success she has right now .
In a world of Paris Hiltons and Kim Kardashians – people who are famous for essentially nothing - Tina Fey is someone you just ca n’t help but love .
I am keeping my fingers crossed that Tina does n’t eventually turn into a Mariah Carey type .
I do n’t think it ’s possible , but you never know .
One of the great tragedies of history is that too many men have been all too willing to kill for the state .
Even worse is that most of the killing has taken place in senseless and unjust wars .
Regardless of who orders them into battle , regardless of whether they are drafted , and regardless of the reasons they are told the war is necessary , it is the soldiers who do the actual fighting , maiming , and killing .
This has been true throughout history .
Even if we accept Hannah Arendt ‘s principle that “ in general the degree of responsibility increases as we draw further away from the man who uses the fatal instrument with his own hands , ” the soldiers at the bottom still bear diffused responsibility for their actions .
Responsibility is not all concentrated in the state ’s leaders .
To soothe their consciences as they kill and plunder for the state , soldiers justify their acts of death and destruction by the doctrine of concentrated responsibility .
This is the idea that the responsibility for the murder and mayhem we call war is concentrated in the sovereign or the heads of state responsible for ordering the troops into battle .
This has also been true throughout history .
We can see this in Shakespeare ’s play Henry V , written about 1599 , which deals with events surrounding the Battle of Agincourt in 1415 — an English victory against the French in the Hundred Years ’
War .
In scene 1 of act 4 , King Henry disguises himself and wanders about the English camp on the night before the battle begins .
Three soldiers — Bates , Court , and Williams — are standing around talking when they are approached by the king in disguise .
Court : “ Brother John Bates is not that the morning which breaks yonder ? ”
Bates : “ I think it be : but we have no great cause to desire the approach of day . ”
Williams : “ We see yonder the beginning of the day , but I think we shall never see the end of it .
Who goes there ? ” King Henry V : “ A friend . ”
Williams : “ Under what captain serve you ? ” King Henry V : “ Under Sir Thomas Erpingham . ”
Williams : “ A good old commander and a most kind gentleman : I pray you , what thinks he of our estate ? ” King Henry V : “ Even as men wrecked upon a sand , that look to be washed off the next tide . ”
Bates : “ He hath not told his thought to the king ? ” King Henry V : “ No ; nor it is not meet he should .
For , though I speak it to you , I think the king is but a man , as I am : the violet smells to him as it doth to me : the element shows to him as it doth to me ; all his senses have but human conditions : his ceremonies laid by , in his nakedness he appears but a man ; and though his affections are higher mounted than ours , yet , when they stoop , they stoop with the like wing .
Therefore when he sees reason of fears , as we do , his fears , out of doubt , be of the same relish as ours are : yet , in reason , no man should possess him with any appearance of fear , lest he , by showing it , should dishearten his army . ”
Bates : “ He may show what outward courage he will ; but I believe , as cold a night as ’tis , he could wish himself in Thames up to the neck ; and so I would he were , and I by him , at all adventures , so we were quit here . ”
King Henry V : “ By my troth , I will speak my conscience of the king : I think he would not wish himself any where but where he is . ”
Bates : “ Then I would he were here alone ; so should he be sure to be ransomed , and a many poor men ’s lives saved . ”
King Henry V : “ I dare say you love him not so ill , to wish him here alone , howsoever you speak this to feel other men ’s minds : methinks I could not die any where so contented as in the king ’s company ; his cause being just and his quarrel honourable . ”
Williams : “ That ’s more than we know . ”
Bates : “ Ay , or more than we should seek after ; for we know enough , if we know we are the kings subjects : if his cause be wrong , our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us . ”
Williams : “ But if the cause be not good , the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make , when all those legs and arms and heads , chopped off in battle , shall join together at the latter day and cry all u2018 We died at such a place ; ’ some swearing , some crying for a surgeon , some upon their wives left poor behind them , some upon the debts they owe , some upon their children rawly left .
I am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle ; for how can they charitably dispose of any thing , when blood is their argument ?
Now , if these men do not die well , it will be a black matter for the king that led them to it ; whom to disobey were against all proportion of subjection . ”
King Henry V : “ So , if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea , the imputation of his wickedness by your rule , should be imposed upon his father that sent him : or if a servant , under his master ’s command transporting a sum of money , be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconciled iniquities , you may call the business of the master the author of the servant ’s damnation : but this is not so : the king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers , the father of his son , nor the master of his servant ; for they purpose not their death , when they purpose their services .
Besides , there is no king , be his cause never so spotless , if it come to the arbitrement of swords , can try it out with all unspotted soldiers : some peradventure have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder ; some , of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury ; some , making the wars their bulwark , that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery .
Now , if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment , though they can outstrip men , they have no wings to fly from God : war is his beadle , war is vengeance ; so that here men are punished for before - breach of the king ’s laws in now the king ’s quarrel : where they feared the death , they have borne life away ; and where they would be safe , they perish : then if they die unprovided , no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited .
Every subject ’s duty is the king ’s ; but every subject ’s soul is his own .
Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed , wash every mote out of his conscience : and dying so , death is to him advantage ; or not dying , the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained : and in him that escapes , it were not sin to think that , making God so free an offer , He let him outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach others how they should prepare .
Williams : “ ‘ Tis certain , every man that dies ill , the ill upon his own head , the king is not to answer it . ”
Bates : “ But I do not desire he should answer for me ; and yet I determine to fight lustily for him . ”
Nothing has changed .
Soldiers think they can have the best of both worlds .
They think they can kill with impunity in a just cause and with immunity in an unjust cause .
But should some of the king ’s soldiers get a little reckless and cause some collateral damage , even though the king , like General Tommy Franks , says “ we do n’t do body counts , ” they are the ones who are fully responsible since “ the king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers . ”
And as for soldiers determining to fight lustily for king and crown or for president and government or , as so many of them think , for flag and freedom or for God and country , there has never been a shortage of willing participants .
Are soldiers excused for the death and destruction they cause in an unjust and immoral war , like say , the war in Iraq ?
Just what is it that excuses them ?
Because their government tells them to do it ?
Because their commander in chief tells them to do it ?
Because their commanding officer tells them to do it ?
Because they wear a military uniform ?
Because they need to fight “ over there ” lest they have to fight “ over here ” ?
Because they are defending our freedoms ?
I have answered all of these questions in the negative here , here , here , here , and here .
The terrible truth is that U.S. soldiers in Iraq are fighting and dying for a lie .
In King Henry ’s reply to Williams , he eludes taking blame by his elaborate analogy .
But Henry is missing something here .
Sending soldiers to fight in a foreign war is not the same as a father sending his son or a master sending his servant on a legitimate business trip .
Bombing , invading , and occupying other countries , and otherwise fighting foreign wars , are illegitimate — even when done under the guise of defense , liberation , regime change , national interest , national security , or humanitarianism .
There are thousands of U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan , and thousands more on the way ( thanks to the new war criminal in chief ) who just a short time ago could neither spell Afghanistan nor locate it on a map .
And as far as I know , no Afghan ever lifted a finger against an American until our troops landed on their soil .
U.S. soldiers , like most soldiers throughout history , have been duped .
The crime of unjustly killing another human being cannot be wiped away .
No matter what his religion , skin color , ethnicity , or nationality .
No matter who tells you to drop the bomb , launch the missile , throw the grenade , or pull the trigger .
And no matter what kind of uniform you are wearing .

Virgin Megastores ’ six remaining retail stores will close by this summer , individuals inside the company told TheWrap on Monday , signaling the end to a once - dominant consumer retail behemoth .
Virgin Entertainment Group CEO
Simon Wright confirmed the news to TheWrap by the afternoon .
" It 's sad news , but it has nothing to do with the stores .
In this economy , we can't justify the other stores to replace the Times Square store . "
The Times Square store made the bulk of Virgin 's profit , and VEG decided to close that flagship in April , they recently announced .
Brick - and - mortar music retailers across the country have been fighting a losing battle with Internet sales .
Tower Records declared bankruptcy last year .
Apple iTunes surpassed Wal - Mart as the biggest music retailer in the United States in April .
But for three decades the Virgin Megastores founded by Richard Branson were a particularly splashy symbol of pop culture .
Branson opened his first record shop on London 's Oxford Street in the early 1970s , and the first megastore at the end of Oxford Street in 1979 .
Branson now owns around 200 companies in over 30 countries .
He could not be reached for comment .
Wright announced the mass closures to employees at Virgin ’s corporate offices in Los Angeles late Friday .
Roughly 100 corporate employees will be laid off and hundreds of Megastore retail workers will be out of a job by the summer .
The megastores in New York ’s Union Square and San Francisco will also close in April .
No date has been set to close the remaining stores in Hollywood , Denver and Orlando .
Virgin Entertainment Group North America will most likely be liquidated by the summer .
Virgin Megastores ’ music sales had been in decline for several years .
In August 2007 two real estate companies – the Related Cos. and Vornado Realty Trust — bought the company from Richard Branson .
The chain , once a looming presence on the American pop culture scene , boasted 11 stores when it was acquired but now operates only six .
The company is privately held and does not release revenue figures .
Wright said VEG ’s new owners were more interested in real estate rather than the retail business .
“ Their attraction was about real estate .
In an ideal world it would have been possible to both have that real estate and develop the business along a different strand .
But the economy has cut off that option , ” he said .
The rent for Virgin ’s Times Square store was $ 54/ sq foot , while market prices put prime space in that area at closer to $ 700 / sq foot .
The 60,000 sq / foot space will be converted into a Forever 21 store .
VEG had been combating slow music sales by adding more “ lifestyle ” products such as apparel and books .
Wright said apparel sales were up 20 % over the holiday season , but music sales were “ disastrous , ” and DVDs and games were not far behind .
Jerry Suarez , former music merchandise manager for VEG and now regional sales director for Island Def Jam Music Group , said the closure of the Megastores is a huge loss for consumers and the music industry .
“ Virgin Times Square had become an icon .
All of the big high - profile events would launch at Virgin .
If you wanted to launch something big , Virgin Times Square was the location . ”
“ It ’s bad for all labels .
But like everything else , we ’ll find other avenues to sell product . ”
But Suarez is optimistic about the fate of physical record stores .
“ I think there ’s still a large business to be had in the physical space .
Everybody is very quick to end it , especially in the press .
For years , everybody has predicted the date of the end of the physical CD , and yet today we ’re still selling CDs , ” he noted .
“ It ’s just a real shame that there will no longer be a Virgin Megastore . ”
After years of resistance , Steve Jobs agreed in January to let record labels have their way with pricing in the iTunes store .
Rather charging the same 99 cents for every song , as Apple had long insisted on doing , iTunes will sell songs for as low as $ 0.69 or as high as $ 1.29 .
In exchange , the labels agreed to stop shackling songs in the iTunes store with DRM protection .
Labels hope the new prices will allow them to charge a higher premium for songs with inelastic demand ( hit singles , essential tracks , etc. ) , while charging less for songs customers may want , but not enough to pay 99 cents for them .
Apple already reaped its end of the bargain by removing DRM from every song in the iTunes music store earlier this year .
According to the LA Times , the labels will get their part of the deal ( variable pricing ) on April 7 .
With only a week and a half to go until Apple is expected to start charging different prices for different songs , what do you think ?
Was Steve Jobs right to let the labels price songs from $ 0.69 to $ 1.29 in return for a DRM - free iTunes music store ?

For sure , Obama left a number of key questions unanswered .
He said he wants " to disrupt , dismantle , and defeat al Qaeda " in the region where the 9/11 plot was hatched , but he did n't spell out how he would measure progress toward that goal ( the " metrics , " he said , have yet to be developed ) ; nor did he offer a definition for defeat .
He did n't suggest what level of Afghani stability would be deemed sufficient for America to downsize its commitment ; in other words , he did n't frame the terms for an exit strategy .
And there were dicey security issues that he did n't address at all - such as how he might seek to disrupt the aid and comfort that terrorists receive from factions within Pakistan 's military intelligence service .

Following the Oslo agreement , Israel made a commitment to the United States that it would not build new settlements or expand existing ones , except to meet “ natural growth . ”
This narrow allowance , never defined , was utilized by Israel to greatly expand settlements and build new settlements , such as Modi'in Ilit .
In April 2003 , Israel for the first time undertook to freeze settlement activity , including natural growth .
The commitment was made in the framework of the “ road map ” agreed to by Israel , the Palestinian Authority , and the Quartet ( the US , the European Union , the UN , and Russia ) , which provides an outline for achieving a two - state permanent resolution to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
In November 2007 , at the joint declaration made at the Annapolis Conference , in which Israel , the Palestinian Authority , the Quartet , and Arab League states took part , Israel confirmed its commitment to the road map 's principles .
Despite its commitment to freeze building in settlements , protocols of the Supreme Planning Committee , in the Civil Administration , reveal plans for substantial expansion of settlements .
The relevant protocols , of the Supreme Planning Committee 's Environment Subcommittee , were made in 2007 and 2008 and dealt with the treatment of sewage of settlements .
B'Tselem received these protocols under the Freedom of Information Act .
The plans uncovered also relate to anticipated expansion of settlements lying east of the route of the Separation Barrier , which Israeli politicians present as Israel 's future border .
These plans are in their initial planning stage , and none have been approved by the political echelon .
However , the fact that the primary planning body in the West Bank considered plans to build thousands of housing units in settlements indicates that the West Bank 's planning bodies flout the official Israeli commitment not to expand settlements in the coming years .
The settlement of Gevaot .

Examples of settlement - expansion planning follow .
In the Eztion Bloc , a neighborhood , containing 550 apartments , is planned for the Gevaot area of the Alon Shvut settlement .
Plans for building in this area , which currently is home to only twelve families , call for the building of 4,450 apartments .
The construction has not yet been approved by the Defense Ministry , but the Environmental Subcommittee approved construction of a sewage - treatment facility , intended for 800 to 1,000 apartments , for the new neighborhood .
At the hearing , it was also decided that the facility would treat the sewage from the adjacent Beit Ayin settlement .
According to the protocol , 2,000 new apartments are planned for construction in Beit Ayin , which currently has some 120 families .
In the Rimonim and Einav settlements , which lie east of the Separation Barrier , sewage treatment has been arranged as a first stage in advancing building plans .
In Rimonim , 254 new apartments are planned , and in Einav , two plans for additional construction .
The jurisdiction area of the settlement Mevo Dotan which is also east of the barrier , is expected to expand .
The Ma'aleh Adumim municipality prepared a sewage - treatment plan for the settlement , including the planned construction of 3,500 apartments in E - 1 , in the framework of treatment of the sewage from SHAI [ Samaria and Judea ] Police Headquarters , which was moved to E - 1 .
In Kfar Adumim , the Subcommittee approved a sewage - treatment plan based on a projected doubling in size of the settlement , to 5,600 residents , in “ the coming years . ”
The Civil Administration 's planning office instructed the Eshkolot settlement to treat its sewage in accordance with the “ full occupancy ” plans of the settlement , which are expected to quintuple the settlement 's population .
Building of settlements breaches international humanitarian law , which prohibits the occupying power to transfer its population to occupied territory and to make permanent changes there .
Establishment and expansion of the settlements result in continuous and extensive infringement of Palestinian rights , among them the right to self - determination , the right to equality , the right of property , the right to an adequate standard of living , the right to water , the right to sanitation and the right to freedom of movement .
Amazon ’s price discrimination
[ UPDATE : An email from Director of Strategic Communication at Amazon , Craig Berman states the following ( quoted with permission ) , which I thought was important to note here : “ Amazon is a marketplace of many sellers , and while sellers are free to set their own prices for items they list , every customer pays the same for every individual offer . ”
I ’m happy to hear that there is no price discrimination per se .
Prime Shipping is a shady product though and I do n’t recommend enrolling in it . ]
Amazon is quoting me a higher price than it ’s quoting my friend , on the same product .
I knew this was theoretically possible , of course , but I did n’t realize online stores engaged in these practices much these days .
After all , is it really worth annoying customers when they find out ?
After a bit of experimentation , it seems to me that what ’s going on here is that those with a Prime membership are being quoted a higher price .
Ouch .
So the thanks I get for paying for the Prime membership and shopping at Amazon a lot is higher prices .
No thank you .
I was about to buy a Canon Digital Rebel XSi and some lenses ( in sum , a $ 1 K + purchase ) when I saw the link to an 8 GB storage unit ( the Transcend 8 GB SDHC Class 6 Flash Memory Card TS8GSDHC6 ) and decided to check it out given the size of photos I may be taking with a 12 MP camera .
I clicked on the link and saw that the card cost $ 10 plus change ( I have no screenshot of this as I did n’t realize I ’d want one later ) .
I then clicked on Add to Shopping Cart at which point I realized that I was logged on under a friend ’s account who ’d been using my computer earlier in the day .
I logged out and logged back in using my own account .
I went back to the same product ’s page and noticed that the unit was now $ 17.13 .
( See screenshot here . )
That ’s annoying , after all , who likes to be charged 70 % more than others ?
I logged out and did a search for the product without being signed on at all .
Now the product came out costing $ 14.14 ( screenshot ) .
I logged back on using my own account to see what I would get now , and back I was at $ 17.13 .
I have another Amazon account for other purposes so I decided to see how that would be treated .
That account was quoted $ 14.14 .
The account I had tried first is the one I use the most .
It is a Prime account .
Prime means that for a payment of $ 79 a year , I get unlimited 2 - day shipping on items that are eligible for it ( which includes quite a few items ) .
It also means that I have an incentive to shop at Amazon , because 2 - day shipping is included on many things so I do n’t have to worry about additional shipping costs .
As I was looking around the site for an explanation of the different prices – I found none , shocking , I know – I learned that it was possible to share my Prime membership with other members of my household .
I decided to share the membership with my other account to test whether it was the Prime membership that was giving me the higher price quote .
Indeed .
Once I signed up for Prime with my second account , that account was now also being quoted $ 17.13 for the item .
When I initially sat down to use Amazon , I was going to spend well over $ 1,000 .
I walked away spending nothing .
Additionally , I have no intention of continuing my Prime membership ( I disabled the auto - renewal for it immediately ) , unless I get some explanation and the chance to buy items at prices others are being offered them .
I sent Customer Service three notes already , but nothing helpful has come back so far .
( The first response was outright offensive as the person either did n’t read or completely misunderstood the point of my email and sent back a canned response having nothing to do with my situation .
I resent the query with what I hoped was a clearer explanation of the situation and still did n’t get anything addressing the question .
I am waiting for the third response , but not holding my breath .
Really , what I ’m waiting for is for someone to tweak my account so I ’m being charged what others are . )
Of course , by not renewing my Prime membership , I ’ll have much less incentive to shop at Amazon period ( after this experience , it certainly wo n’t be the first place I go to look for things anyway ) .
I guess most Prime members probably do n’t realize this is going on or they do n’t care about the differential so perhaps this practice does n’t matter in the grand scheme of things .
But it matters to me , more on principle than based on the $ 3 differential ( although 21 % could amount to a lot depending on the price ) .
I ’m curious to know what price quote others get on that product when they log on .
If you ’re a Prime member , do you see $ 17.13 ?
If not , do you get $ 14.14 or less ?
Do you have other examples of such differentiated pricing at Amazon based on user account ?
By the way , to read about the practices going on here , I recommend Joe Turow ’s book on Breaking Up America .
( No , of course that ’s not a link to an Amazon page , I do n’t plan on supplying those here anymore , not unless this gets cleared up . )
[ UPDATE :
In case you do n’t read the 100 + comments , this follow - up post with a screenshot by a reader is helpful .
The issue concerns being pointed to different vendors with different product and shipping costs that all seem to add up to the same $ 17.13 .
This still means that those with a Prime membership end up paying more for the product on the whole when including shipping costs already paid for the Prime membership .
Slower shipping for this product for a lower price is not an option for such customers . ]
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. Republicans who have long dominated American politics find themselves fighting with each other for a way out of the wilderness after losing the last two elections to Barack Obama ’s Democrats .
Michael Steele speaks after being elected Republican National Committee chairman in Washington January 30 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Molly Riley
A feud between conservative talk radio king Rush Limbaugh and the Republicans ’ new national party chairman , Michael Steele , is emblematic of the distance the party has to go to achieve dominance once again .
Laughing from the sidelines are President Obama ’s White House and the Democratic Party , eager to inflict further political pain by baldly declaring Republicans “ the party of Limbaugh , ” a reference to the polarizing man who is beloved by conservatives but viewed with skepticism by many others .
Leading Republicans are engaged in a “ what do we do now ” debate as they seek a way to rehabilitate their image in the age of Obama .
Before Obama was elected in November , Republicans had been in charge of the White House for 28 of the last 40 years .
So far , party elders are trying to steer the party back to its roots by demonstrating fiscal responsibility and fighting Obama ’s major increases in government spending -- an objective that faltered during Republican George W. Bush ’s presidency .
They also see a desperate need to increase the appeal of the Republican Party beyond its white , Southern base .
This was part of the thinking behind the choice of Steele , who is the first African - American to be elected party chairman .
Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty , a Republican in a Democratic - leaning state and often mentioned as a possible contender in the 2012 presidential race , told Reuters the party should have three main goals :
“ Number one , the idea factory has grown stale .
We need new leaders with new ideas .
Number two , we need to do a better job of convincing younger voters , female voters , diverse voters of why they should support Republicans or conservatives , ” Pawlenty said .
“ Number three , I think we have to communicate in a more modern and contemporary fashion .
That includes being more optimistic and more hopeful . ”
Pawlenty said Republicans may benefit from what he described as Democrats “ overplaying their hand . ”
The idea is that Democrats flush with power -- holding the White House and the Congress -- are seeking to force Americans into liberal spending and social policies that they do not support , and that Republicans will benefit from the backlash .
“ We may be a beneficiary of them overreaching .
But that itself is not a vision for the future of our party and our country .
We do n’t want to be just a beneficiary of luck , ” Pawlenty said .
INCENDIARY AND UGLY
Limbaugh drew a rebuke from Steele by telling conservatives last weekend in Washington that he wanted Obama to fail “ if his mission is to restructure and reform this country so that capitalism and individual liberty are not its foundation . ”
Steele declared subsequently to CNN that Limbaugh ’s comments were incendiary and ugly , prompting Limbaugh to question Steele ’s ability to lead the party .
Steele eventually apologized to Limbaugh in an acknowledgment of his power as a popular radio host , but not before Republicans were complaining about him .
“ Steele won the party ’s chairmanship five weeks ago , ” said Republican strategist Scott Reed .
“ He fired the entire staff .
Who ’s running the place ?
Who ’s raising the money , recruiting the candidates , designing the voter identification programs and helping work with the congressional wing to design a message ?
Who ’s doing all this work ?
No one . ”
The dust - up was only one of many challenges the Republicans are encountering .
A young up - and - coming Republican , Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal , was widely mocked for his televised response to Obama ’s speech to a joint session of Congress last week .
Jindal , 37 , an Indian - American , had an uninspired performance , relating party platitudes in a speech delivery that was widely panned .
“ I hope people look at the content of the speech , not just the delivery .
You know , for years , I ’ve been told I speak too quickly .
Now I ’m told I speak too slowly , ” Jindal told CNN ’s “ Larry King Live . ”
Republican strategist Ron Kaufman said Republicans need to be able to work with Obama when they consider him right but be respectfully against him when they think he is wrong , such as in the debate over the $ 787 billion economic stimulus bill that Republicans opposed .
“ To me , the new cool is competent .
And the way for us to come back is to prove to the American voters that we are the party of competence , ” Kaufman said .
NEW YORK - Hearst Corp. will run its final printed edition of the Seattle Post - Intelligencer today and shift the entire publication to the Web after failing to find a buyer for the money - losing newspaper .
The New York - based publisher sought unsuccessfully to sell the Post - Intelligencer after the daily posted a $ 14 million loss last year .
Hearst may close the San Francisco Chronicle if it can't negotiate cost - cutting concessions from its unions .
" They are the first major metropolitan newspaper to flip the switch and go online only , " said Ken Doctor , an analyst with Outsell Inc. in Burlingame , Calif .
" This is going to be an important model for people to watch , whether this can survive as a Web - only presence . "
Since December , four newspaper publishers have filed for bankruptcy protection , including Tribune Co. , and the owner of the Philadelphia Inquirer .
E.W. Scripps Co. last month closed its Rocky Mountain News in Denver after failing to find a buyer and Gannett Co. said it will shutter the Tucson Citizen in Arizona if it can't sell it by March 21 .
Hearst will cut about 145 newsroom jobs at the Post - Intelligencer , leaving the newspaper with 20 reporters and editors , said Paul Luthringer , a Hearst spokesman .
Hearst is raising subscription prices and has considered trimming its page count to counter the accelerating decline in advertising sales , Steven Swartz , head of the newspaper division , said last week .
US newspapers shed 5,000 newsroom jobs in 2008 as ad revenue fell 16 percent , and 2009 " may be the worst year yet , " according to a study released Sunday by the Pew Project for Excellence in Journalism .
The New York Times Co. and Gannett Co. are selling assets and cutting jobs to help cope with ad declines .
Hearst said it would terminate a joint operating agreement between the Post - Intelligencer and the Seattle Times in which the latter arranged advertising , printing , and distribution for both newspapers .
The Post - Intelligencer 's average paid weekday circulation was 117,572 as of Sept. 30 , according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations .
The Times had a weekday circulation of 198,741 .

About a month ago , we featured Concourse E's green home in Atlanta on 81 Weatherby , but Concourse E also developed the neighboring parcel with two townhomes .
Like 81 , 85 and 89 Weatherby are both posh , modern , and green — just the way we like them .
85 is going for $ 524,500 , while 89 is going for $ 529,500 , which is roughly $ 170 per square foot .
For that , you get three bedrooms , three - and - a - half bathrooms , and a large list of green features :
Solar power ( 3.3 KW solar PV system )
Solar hot water
Ultra high efficiency 19 SEER HVAC
Soy - based spray foam insulation
High efficiency aluminum - clad windows
Extremely insulated and sealed building envelope
Vegetated wall
Non-toxic termite / mold / allergen control
Steel construction
CaeserStone countertops throughout
Bosch Energy Star appliances
Dual - flush Caroma toilets
Sustainable bamboo flooring
Low VOC paints and adhesives
Low maintenance / zero water requirement landscaping
70 - 95 % energy cost savings
One of the most difficult aspects of dense living , I believe , is shared walls and noisy neighbors , but Concourse E has mitigated that with a three inch air gap between double insulated walls .
The two townhomes are , in reality , only connected in the front , rear , and top of the structure — a design element that will end up benefitting the owners many times over .
Also , you may be interested in knowing that the power bill at 85 and 89 Weatherby for the month of February was $ 4 .
Not bad …

HORSHAM , England , March 14 ( Reuters ) - The Bank of Canada hinted on Saturday it could soon start printing money to create growth after a global pledge by central banks to take extreme action as economic conditions deteriorate .
G20 central bankers , meeting with finance ministers ahead of the London summit on April 2 , signed up to a statement to keep interest rates low for as long as it took to get the economy back on its feet and engage in quantitative easing if needed .
The Bank of Canada has already said it will soon outline a framework for quantitative and credit easing , giving it the means to conduct similar actions to the Bank of England and Swiss National Bank .
“ It ’s important to do that in a comprehensive , holistic fashion so that people can see the range of tools that the bank continues to have , ” Carney told reporters after the meeting of old and emerging economic powers in southern England .
“ In putting out a framework , it does not necessarily follow that we would immediately implement that action .
Those are discussions we take as a governing council at the appropriate time , given the economic outlook . ”
But Carney said many of the downside risks to the economy the central bank had already identified were materialising , hinting that a downgrade to the Bank of Canada ’s growth forecasts could be just around the corner .
The BoC updates its forecasts next month , with the estimates it made in January -- especially for 3.8 percent growth in 2010 -- looking increasingly optimistic .
“ I would draw your attention to the commitment of central banks to maintain expansionary policies , ” he said .
“ Rates will remain low for longer .
In Canada … our overnight or target rate can be expected to remain at its current level of 50 basis points or lower until there are clear signs that the output gap is beginning to close . ”
Officials at the meeting underlined the significance of the joint central bank pledge , signalling that even traditionally conservative central banks had indicated they were prepared to take the leap into quantitative easing as they run out of room to cut interest rates .
“ Many countries have already reduced policy to the bone , ” Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega .
Newspaper reports have suggested the U.S. Federal Reserve has been impressed by the impact of the BoE ’s action on British government bond yields - and that was before the BoE started buying up gilts in a 75 billion pound scheme .

TransLink has once again banned ads that it claims offend its advertising policy .
Yesterday , the regional transportation authority announced that it wo n’t accept creative material submitted by the B.C. Humanist Association .
It wanted to place ads on the transit system saying , “ You can be good without God . ”
In 2006 , the B.C. Court of Appeal ruled that TransLink violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms with an earlier prohibition on political advertising .
Under Section 2 ( b ) , the charter guarantees freedom of expression .
Section 15 of the charter prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion .
TransLink issued a statement yesterday ( February 6 ) that its advertising policy will not accept anything that “ promotes or opposes a specific theology or religious ethic , point of view , policy or action ” .
Before the 2005 provincial election , TransLink would n’t allow ads of a political nature from the Canadian Federation of Students and the B.C. Teachers ’ Federation .
The ads promoted a campaign called " Rock the Vote " .
The two organizations challenged that decision on constitutional grounds , but lost in B.C. Supreme Court .
However in 2006 , a B.C. Court of Appeal decision reversed the lower court ruling .
B.C.'s highest court determined that TransLink was a “ government ” agency that had to abide by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
In a 2 - 1 decision , the B.C. Court of Appeal ruled that the TransLink ’s ban on political ads infringed on the organizations ’ constitutional right to freedom of expression .
In 2007 , TransLink sought a stay of the order pending an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada .
The B.C. Court of Appeal rejected that application .
The B.C. Civil Liberties Association was an intervenor in the case .
Emerging Giants Russia , China , Brazil and India Looming Collapse 2009
I hope you 've had a great start to your New Year !
At the same time , however , I trust you are not counting on the latest holiday rally in the stock market — or the most recent incarnation of the Obama rescue package — to transform 2009 into a positive year for the economy .
The reasons :
In addition to the massive wealth destruction I told you about two weeks ago and the continuing debt collapse I 've been warning you about for many months now , the overseas engines of global growth are also collapsing .
This does not negate my long - term view that certain overseas economies offer great future opportunities .
But it does represent a major short - term threat to U.S. investors , U.S. companies and the U.S. economy as a whole .
The undeniable reality :
The debt crisis that first appeared in the U.S. subprime mortgage market … then precipitated a Wall Street meltdown … and has now driven the American economy into its sharpest decline since the Great Depression … has now spread to the entire world .
It is driving the economies of Western Europe and Japan into an unprecedented tailspin .
It threatens the economic — and potentially political — stability of Russia , China and several emerging market nations .
And it 's setting the stage for a global depression of epic dimensions .
Here are some of the most vulnerable major economies …

Never in modern history has the success or failure of a major emerging economy been so dependent on one single commodity !
And never before has that commodity fallen so far and so fast as Russian crude oil !
Russia does have other resource and revenue sources .
But in just the past six months , Urals crude , Russia 's primary export blend , has plunged from a high of nearly $ 141 per barrel to a low of a meager $ 32.34 — a 77 % crash that 's pounded Russian stocks like a sledgehammer and sliced through the Russian economy like a serrated sickle .
The big dilemma :
To balance its federal budget , Russia must get a minimum of $ 70 per barrel for its crude oil .
But at $ 32 and change , it 's getting less than HALF that amount .
The entire country is losing money hand over fist .
No wonder Russia 's stock market has plunged 72 % , forcing 25 separate stock exchange shutdowns !
Transneft , the Russian oil transporter , is down from $ 2,025 in January 2008 to a recent low of $ 270 .
Gazprom , the natural gas monopoly , has lost more than two - thirds of its market capitalization since May .
Meanwhile , Lukoil fell from a May peak of $ 113 to a recent low of $ 32 .
Russia 's oil - driven real estate bubble is also collapsing .
That 's why Russian construction and real estate giant Sistema - Hals lost more than 94 % of its value last year alone … why PIK Group , another major construction giant , collapsed by 96 % … and why the entire RCP Shares Index of Russian developers has sunk 92 % since its record high in June 2007 .
Ford , Renault and Volkswagen are halting production at Russian assembly lines .
Unemployment is likely to surge to 10 % and beyond .
Massive amounts of foreign capital are fleeing the country .
In a desperate attempt to stem the tide , the Russian government has devalued the ruble 11 times since November , and thrown a quarter of its foreign currency reserves at the raging debt crisis .
But it 's still not enough .
Russia 's primary source of revenues — energy exports — is in shambles ; and unless crude oil prices could somehow DOUBLE in a big hurry , Russia 's economic and financial decline cannot end .
Standard & Poor 's has cut Russia 's long - term debt rating for the first time in nine years , citing dangerous outflows and a “ rapid depletion ” of currency reserves .
And more downgrades are in the offing .
Even a major debt default is not unthinkable .
The biggest danger : Political upheaval and social unrest .
Even before this crisis , Russia 's middle class earned less than $ 500 per month .
Now , with the devastating plunge in oil revenues already in place , those numbers are falling to even lower levels .
For a nation with a cost of living that rivals that of the U.S. , Western Europe and Japan , the last thing the Russian people needed was a depression .
Yet that 's exactly what they 're getting .
I visited Russia last year before the collapse in oil prices .
I spoke to a variety of professionals and people on the street .
And I stayed with friends who work in government jobs .
From everything I had read , I had anticipated signs of greater prosperity .
Instead , I was surprised to see how little average citizens had benefited from the recent years of rapid economic growth .
Yes , they have more access to a wider variety of goods that were scarce during the Soviet era .
But most professionals — such as teachers , doctors , nurses and government employees — are still living on the edge of poverty .
Equally surprising is the popular disgust and disdain for the government .
Public opinion surveys and press reports may indicate broad support for the Kremlin 's foreign policy , and they seem to be accurate .
But support for domestic policies is another matter entirely .
My view :
Any major disappointment with respect to pocketbook issues could lead to major political changes , the outcome of which is largely unpredictable .
China Far More Vulnerable Than Expected
China 's extraordinary expansion of the past decade fueled booms in global trade , commodities and emerging markets .
It was a major growth engine that turbo - charged Australia , Brazil , Southeast Asia and even Japan .
Now , however , that engine is grinding to a screeching halt .
Indeed , when historians look back to major pivot points of this global economic crisis , they will undoubtedly point to the abrupt end of China 's boom .
Many of us assumed that because China 's economy was growing so quickly — at a breakneck pace of 10 % or more per year — it could easily afford to slow down by a few percentage points and still be in far better shape than most other economies .
But now I seriously question that theory .
Indeed , more often than not , companies , industries and entire nations that enjoy the biggest booms are also vulnerable to some of the biggest busts .
Instead of a mere slowdown , as many still seem to expect , China 's economy could suffer a wholesale collapse .
Exports , which still represent two - fifths of the Chinese economy , are already sinking fast .
And the domestic economy , much of which depends directly or indirectly on the revenues flowing from exports , is also beginning to sink .
Warning signs are everywhere : Stocks , down 60 % just in the last 12 months ; imports , down 17.9 % in November alone ; foreign investments to China , off 36.5 % last year .
In response , the government has slashed interest rates and pledged a $ 582 billion stimulus package .
But that 's mere pocket change compared to China 's trillions in vulnerable exports .
Moreover , it has done little to help millions of small - and medium - sized businesses which are already shutting down and laying off millions .
A big problem : 45 % of the Chinese government bailout is earmarked for the cement and housing industry .
Meanwhile , cash - flow problems are sweeping through the entire economy , downing airlines , manufacturers and property companies .
Airlines like China Southern and China Eastern , for example , have been losing money hand over fist .
China 's auto sales are plunging .
Its shipbuilding industry is in a tailspin .
And its real estate market is collapsing .
Next , expect surging unemployment … mass reverse migrations from urban centers to the countryside … spreading popular unrest … and a major challenge to authority .
Chinese leaders have already admitted that an economic downturn would test their ability to govern .
Now , that downturn is here — and the ultimate test , on the near horizon .
Meanwhile …
India , also heavily dependent on foreign demand for its goods , is suffering its worst export slump in recent memory .
Overseas shipments plunged 12.1 % in October and another 9.9 % in November , forcing companies like Tata Motors , India 's biggest truck maker , and Hyundai Motor to cut output , fire workers and shut down factories .
Brazil , which was growing at a record pace until the third quarter , has suddenly frozen in its tracks .
Much of the foreign money it counted on has vanished , leaving acute capital shortages in its wake .
Auto sales have gone dead , leaving biggest - ever inventories of unsold cars .
Credit , abundantly available just a few months ago , is now gone .
Japan has been slammed by its worst recession since World War II … with stock prices plunging to new 18 - year lows … industrial output suffering the largest monthly drop since records were kept …
Toyota reporting its first loss in 70 years … layoff victims filling tent parks … and worse .
Everywhere from Argentina and Mexico to Australia , New Zealand and even the once - rich Middle East , the worldwide debt crisis , the bust in commodities and the sharp slowdown in global trade are transforming massive booms into instant recessions .
It 's happening fast and it 's accelerating .
Government rescue programs are n't nearly enough to turn the tide .
And it 's another key reason you must approach 2009 with great caution .
Stick with safety .
Do n't veer from the course I have laid out for avoiding the dangers .
Wait for the truly big price declines ahead before reinvesting !
Good luck and God bless !

10 Apr 09 , 07:52 Analysis on Russia
what is said here is complete rubish , i stoped reading at the chapter about russia already , just plain and simple provocation and propaganda .
Where did u see Russian people unhappy with the government ?
It is the best government they had for years and years .
U also speak about poverty , well yes everyone knows that only a small range of people have actually benefited from recent growth , but guess what ?
An average russian person could n't care less .
You judge people from american perspective .
For an average russian person , prosperity is not their top priority in life , they have n't been brain washed by american dream and strive for money .
More over , if you analysed great depression of 30s , u would know that devaluation of curency helped cure the crisis than , america , europe japan , all did it sooner or later and were able to recover .
Also , the oil prices went this only only due to panic , as we can already see they started to recover .
But it really it was the " disgust " to government part , which gave you out for being clueless in the subject , I shall repeat again , Russian people respect and follow it 's government more than ever these days , and it 's truly is a great goverment if u simply look at the statistics starting 2002 .

Ilya , you are overly patriotic .
" An average russian person could n't care less " ?
Of course they care , those doctors and teachers that live on $ 500 a month , when Moscow for example is one of the most expensive cities in the world !
Russia is one of the richest country ( in terms of natural resources ) , yet the level of poverty in our country utterly shocks me .
If Russian people " respect its government more than ever these day " , then why do we have such low number of those who vote for the president ?
Russian people do not believe in its government .
Well who can blame them , when it is so corrupted .
Mark Gan
21 Apr 10 , 21:59 interesting to hear from the Russians
Good to hear first hand from the Russians !
It 's obvious to anyone who reads and thinks about things is that Governmental corruption is the base cause for the predicament the world is in right now .
Here in the usa people are still in denial of how bad it really is .
Everyone is narcotized by sports and television .
Scratch through the thin veil and you see fear and panic .
Not pretty .

I think that you need to include Iran and Turkey in the list as well .
ISLAMABAD , Pakistan —
Three missiles thought to have been fired from remotely piloted American aircraft struck a Taliban training camp in northwestern Pakistan and killed 21 militants , according to a local government official and news reports on Friday .
Fifteen other people were wounded in the strike , from about 9:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Thursday , on a training camp some 20 miles from Parachinar , the capital of the Kurram tribal area , according to the official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity .
The camp was under the command of Fazal Saeed , a local militant commander aligned with the Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud .
On Friday evening , the official said the dead were all militants .
The attack was the sixth on Mr. Mehsud ’s camps in the tribal areas since President Obama took office , expanding the covert war run by the Central Intelligence Agency and carried out largely by remotely piloted aircraft .
The degree of the economic downturn of the last year is surprising even to Warren Buffett , often called the world ’s best investor .
“ It has fallen off a cliff , ” said Buffett , chairman of Berkshire Hathaway , in an interview that aired on CNBC ’s Squawk Box early Monday .
“ Not only has the economy slowed down , people have changed their behavior like nothing I have ever seen . ”
Buffett said that so far , the message from the government has been “ muddled , ” but that the government will play a big role in turning the economy around , though he said it wo n’t happen fast .
“ You ca n’t turn around on a dime , ” Buffett said .
He said people ’s changed habits have been good news for companies like Wal - Mart , and bad new for luxury goods , like high - end jewelry .

Escape Slide Parachute
Myth :
You can survive a fall from an airplane by using an escape slide or a life raft as a parachute
This myth is most famously portrayed in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom , where Indiana Jones jumps out of an airplane with an escape raft , inflates mid-air , and lands on a snowy mountain slope .
Drop setup
They used the " Big Dawg " Sikorsky S - 58 to lift Buster to a 2000 ft drop height , which was high enough because you reach terminal velocity after 14 seconds of free fall .
Buster was setup with several instruments including an accelerometer in head , a velocity meter that uses air pressure , frangible bones , and shock meters .
Drop 1
For the first drop they rigged Buster in center of the raft , which turned out to be a bad job .
The rigging gave way after they had lifted the raft 400 ft up , ejecting Buster from the raft .
Buster was completely destroyed and Adam reacted in shock to the carnage : " Buster is a pile of scrap . "
Drop 2
They improved the rigging in the raft by using big hauling straps instead .
Somehow they managed to resurrect Buster .
They must have had a lot of spare parts on hand because even the instruments were pretty trashed from the first mishap .
The raft flipped over and floated in like a parachute at 22 mph .
Parachutists usually land at about 14mph .
This might have been fine for Buster , except he was ejected when the raft flipped over and landed at 154 MPH .
Drop 3
For the third drop they decided to re-rig the raft to be used as a parachute to keep Buster from falling separately .
They managed to resurrect Buster resurrected yet again , though he 's headless and looking pretty bad for the wear .
The parachute safely worked as a parachute , but the rate of descent was too fast .
Initially they thought Buster was ok , but once they got close they saw that Buster 's limbs were pretty wrecked .
The chest sensors showed that he might have lived ( 50g shock watch was broken , but 75 and 100 were not ) , however , even though Buster might have lived , the notion that someone could have lept out and rigged the parachute - like harness is very unlikely .
They had already demonstrated the problems with the Indiana - Jones - style descent , so mythbusted .
( Life raft ) busted
DC - 10 Escape Slide
With the life raft busted , they turned their attention to using an escape slide as a parachute .
After a little bit of playing around with the slide they got to work strapping Buster into the raft .
It 's clear from the quick montage they had of the rig that Buster is pretty well hosed .
The outer silicon skin layer is mostly split apart and held together with what look like large plastic zip ties .
Also , his limbs appear to be only partial now -- no hands or feet .
The escape slide wobbled back and forth as it fell , but it never flipped over .
It landed with a very soft bounce and , for the first time , Buster looked entirely okay .
Not a single frangible bone was broken and the 50 , 75 , and 100g shock watches were intact .
In other words , it was a great ride .
( Escape slide ) mythbusted because it would not be possible to actually use the escape slide to jump out of a plane .
Either you inflate it and it gets ripped off before you can get in it , or you inflate it inside the plane and can't get it out of the door .
Falling in an airplane , Longest fall without a parachute
Myth :
You can survive a 33,000 ft fall inside a DC - 9 .
This myth is n't a myth as it's based on a true story .
On Jan 26 , 1972 Flight 364 to Zagreb was blown up by a bomb .
Vesna Vulović survived the fall from 33,000 feet strapped into her flight attendant seat in the rear section of the plane .
She was seriously injured , but lived .
Wikipedia article on Flight 364
To replicate the myth they chopped off the tail section of an actual plane and whittled it down to 3500 pounds so that it could be lifted with the Sikorsky S - 58 .
Buster , or rather what was left of Buster after all the previous dropping , was strapped into the flight attendant 's seat .
The fuselage was dropped from a height of 2000 ft ( enough for terminal velocity ) : CRUNCH .
The fuselage clocked at 96 mph , so it only took off about 30 % of the terminal velocity speed .
Buster was turned into shrapnel and definitely did not ' survive , ' but given the right falling angle things might have been different as the fuselage absorbed some of the fall energy .
( tail section ) plausible : they could not replicate it , but given that it did happen it 's clear there are circumstances in which it would be survivable .
Exploding Hair Cream
Myth : A pilot of a Canadian F - 104 starfighter had his head blown off after putting on his oxygen mask .
The reason : his hair cream .
History
In the early 90s a pilot getting into a jet on an aircraft carrier put on his oxygen mask .
The oxygen reacted to his hair cream , blew his helmet off , and gave him third - degree burns .
Apollo 1 incident : Faulty wiring and pure oxygen environment led to the death of the astronauts .
Small - scale test
The setup an " oxygen - rich " blast chamber ( they did n't specify the how much oxygen they pumped in ) and put an ignitor and hair samples inside :
Hair w/o hair cream : no ignition
Hair w/ hair cream : caught on fire
Full - scale test setup
They resued the Sharammer from the Jaws Special as their makeshift XMB ' jet ' .
Kari made some toupees from barbershop hair to go on the ballistics gel head and they tracked down both an authentic ear F - 104 helmet as well as an air - tight MiG helmet to test with .
For the ignition source , plan A was a 24V short circuit and plan B was a model rocket ignitor .
Test setup
They setup the fake jet cabin in the parking lot and tried to bring it to 5psi for the test .
There was too much air leaking out so they started worrying about their setup .
Just as Grant was telling Adam not to walk around the back of the jet the backend of it blew out .
" Oh , that side ! "
Adam managed to get everything sealed up well enough for the test .
F - 104 Helmet test ( open helmet with oxygen facemask )
For the first test they pressurized the cabin to 5 psi with regular air .
The authentic F - 104 helmet was placed on the ballistics gel head ( lathered up with hair cream ) and oxygen was run to the head with a facemask .
After 5 minutes of oxygen flow they setoff the short circuit ignitor -- NO explosion .
They switched over to the model rocket ignitor , which sent up smoke from the helmet .
Tory triggered a C02 fire extinguisher inside the pressurized cockpit , which sent the pressure in the cockpit up to 10 psi and made things dangerous for a bit as the cockpit bled off the high pressure .
End result : gel head was melted to face mask , but no decapitating explosion .
Air - tight MiG helmet
They were still in search of their ' explosive decapitation , ' so they switched to a full face , air - tight MiG helmet .
They also added a fake Jamie mustache to the head for artistic touch .
There was no pressurization because the helmet is sealed , and they used the 24V short circuit to ignite .
There were streams of flame shot out from the helmet , but there was no decapitating force .
Hair care products only
They were n't completely clear on the setup for this myth , but it appeared that for the final test they doused the head and cockpit with lots of hair care products .
There was an extended fire the blew off the top of the cockpit , sucked it back down , and then popped it off again .
mythbusted : Hair cream in an oxygen - rich enviornment can cause aggressive fire , but it wo n't ' decapitate '
My Virgin DIY Haircut Experience
My mom calls it the re-opening of Ning ’s salon , my friends are laughing at the facebook comments , my wife is proud of her work and I ’m just relieved that it ’s over .
Over the weekend , my first DIY Haircut officially concluded .
How the DIY Haircut Came About
It ’s funny how working at home changes someone ’s priorities .
What was once an important activity like getting a haircut all of a sudden is n’t so critical .
I remember reminding myself to get a haircut before my birthday .
That was January .
I really did n’t think it was that bad , but my wife came up with an idea after she claims that it could potentially give her more nightmares if she had to suffer through my current “ look ” – How about I just give you a haircut myself ?
First Virgin Haircut Experience
Without thinking , I said “ SURE ” but when it came down to the night that we were going to cut my hair , I was really nervous .
She did n’t seem like she even researched how it ’s done so what if she messes it up ?
Worst yet , what if she cut herself ?
What about me ?
I only have one head .
Haircut Trauma
I never knew that I could be so uptight because my shoulder muscles actually hurt the next morning from being so tense .
While my wife was carefully constructing her masterpiece , I was frozen .
I probably looked like a zombie , but my wife was patient the whole way .
DIY Results
After the intense experience ( I thought it was anyway ) , I picked up my glasses and thought “ Wow , I look cool . ”
My wife was so proud and so good .
We should do it another time .
Benefits of a DIY Project
It might not be cutting your own hair , but I ’m sure many of you have DIY projects that you want to start too .
Here ’s what my experience taught me that applies to any do - it - yourself project :
Do it Yourself Projects are Scary the First Time You May Not Know Everything Before You Start DIY Gets Easier The More You Do It Eventually It Gets Completed The Experience is Always Memorable DIY Projects can Become the Talk of Your Social Circle DIY is For Sure a Cheaper Option Doing it Yourself Does n’t Mean It ’s Not as Good You Can Always Hire Someone to Finish It if It Gets Out of Hand You Always Have More Control and You Can Be as Picky as You Want
What ’s the Progress of Your DIY Project
So do n’t be lazy .
Make the move .
Start that project and see where it takes you .
You might like to do it so much that it will become your hobby one day .
For some , it might even turn into a business opportunity .
Whatever project it is , you will be proud once it ’s finished and you can save some cash along the way .
In this economy , who would n’t want that ?
Deux ans après la sortie des Nikon Z 6 et Z 7 , le constructeur vient d’annoncer l’arrivée prochaine des Z 6 II et Z 7 II , seconde version de ces hybrides plein format .
L’annonce est prévue pour le 14 octobre 2020 à 14 heures , un compte à rebours étant visible sur le site de Nikon France .
En attendant , des rumeurs diffusées sur Internet permettent de donner une idée des caractéristiques de ces boîtiers , déjà présentés comme de belles évolutions sur plusieurs points .
WASHINGTON --
While Congress has been flaying companies for giving out bonuses while on the government dole , lawmakers have a longstanding tradition of rewarding their own employees with extra cash -- also courtesy of taxpayers .
Capitol Hill bonuses in 2008 were among the highest in years , according to LegiStorm , an organization that tracks payroll data .
The average House aide earned 17 % more in the fourth quarter of the year , when the bonuses were paid , than in previous quarters , according to the data .
That was the highest ...
Cussing in German : " Schimpfwörter "
Before we get started , it 's important to note that in general , German is a very lenient cussing language .
I 've heard 7 year - olds readily use the equivalent for " shit " in front of their mothers .
It 's just hard to get the same severity as in English .
But , without further ado :
Arsch : ass
: ass Arschloch : asshole
: asshole Depp : idiot
: idiot Du Sack ! : you , scrotum
: you , scrotum Dummkopf : idiot
: idiot Einzeller : one - celler ( usu. for blonds )
: one - celler ( usu. for blonds )
Fick dich ins Knie :
Fuck yourself in the knee
: Fuck yourself in the knee Heulsuse : crybaby
: crybaby Scheiße : shit
: shit Schlampe : slut
: slut Trottel : idiot
: idiot Verpiss dich ! :
Fuck off !
: Fuck off !
Vollidiot : complete idiot
: complete idiot Wichser : Wanker
Fotze : Cunt .
Note :
This will get you slapped !
It 's also derogatory enough not to be in the dictionary .
And finally , THE German cuss word : Enjoy !
April 2009
I usually avoid politics , but since we now seem to have an administration that 's open to suggestions , I 'm going to risk making one .
The single biggest thing the government could do to increase the number of startups in this country is a policy that would cost nothing : establish a new class of visa for startup founders .
The biggest constraint on the number of new startups that get created in the US is not tax policy or employment law or even Sarbanes - Oxley .
It 's that we wo n't let the people who want to start them into the country .
Letting just 10,000 startup founders into the country each year could have a visible effect on the economy .
If we assume 4 people per startup , which is probably an overestimate , that 's 2500 new companies .
Each year .
They would n't all grow as big as Google , but out of 2500 some would come close .
By definition these 10,000 founders would n't be taking jobs from Americans : it could be part of the terms of the visa that they could n't work for existing companies , only new ones they 'd founded .
In fact they 'd cause there to be more jobs for Americans , because the companies they started would hire more employees as they grew .
The tricky part might seem to be how one defined a startup .
But that could be solved quite easily : let the market decide .
Startup investors work hard to find the best startups .
The government could not do better than to piggyback on their expertise , and use investment by recognized startup investors as the test of whether a company was a real startup .
How would the government decide who 's a startup investor ?
The same way they decide what counts as a university for student visas .
We 'll establish our own accreditation procedure .
We know who one another are .
10,000 people is a drop in the bucket by immigration standards , but would represent a huge increase in the pool of startup founders .
I think this would have such a visible effect on the economy that it would make the legislator who introduced the bill famous .
The only way to know for sure would be to try it , and that would cost practically nothing .
Thanks to Trevor Blackwell , Paul Buchheit , Jeff Clavier , David Hornik , Jessica Livingston , Greg Mcadoo , Aydin Senkut , and Fred Wilson for reading drafts of this .

WASHINGTON 
The director of the Central Intelligence Agency concluded in late 2005 that a conversation picked up on a government wiretap was serious enough to require notifying Congressional leaders that Representative Jane Harman , Democrat of California , could become enmeshed in an investigation into Israeli influence in Washington , former government officials said Thursday .
But Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales told the director of the agency , Porter J. Goss , to hold off on briefing lawmakers about the conversation , between Ms. Harman and an Israeli intelligence operative , despite a longstanding government policy to inform Congressional leaders quickly whenever a member of Congress could be a target of a national security investigation .
One reason Mr. Gonzales intervened , the former officials said , was to protect Ms. Harman because they saw her as a valuable administration ally in urging The New York Times not to publish an article about the National Security Agency ’s program of wiretapping without warrants .
The accounts provided new details about tension between senior C.I.A. officials and the attorney general over what to make of the wiretapped conversations involving Ms. Harman , which the former government officials said first occurred in spring 2005 .
The involvement of both Mr. Gonzales and Mr. Goss in the case involving Ms. Harman was first reported by Congressional Quarterly , but the former officials provided new details .
In a fascinating challenge to the establishment , the Swedish Pirate Party will be fielding 20 candidates in this summer ’s European elections .
The controversial party is running on the platform that the restrictive laws concerning copyrighted and patented material are creating a negative environment of citizen monitoring .
Christian Engstrom , the primary candidate for the party , told the Politiken newspaper “ If the politicians want to prevent ordinary citizens from sharing films , music and other forms of culture , they have to constantly expand the ability to monitor – because as soon as the authorities close down one culture - sharing facility , another pops up very quickly . ”
Engstrom feels this monitoring has already exceeded public limits , adding : “ There is a law on the way in Sweden which is already in force in Denmark .
Rights owners to a film , for example , can demand the name of the person who pays for an internet connection if they are able to track a person uploading or downloading films illegally . ”
In 2006 , the Pirate Party fought the national election , but gained just 0.63 percent of the votes .
The party does not want to terminate all forms of copyright , just categorise them between commercial and non-commercial use .
But it knows the battle will be fought and decided in the European arena , and is ready for the fight .
I 've lost a week 's worth of work before because I 've realized that a comic could be done better .
I scrap stuff all the time .
In fact , I find it kind of exciting to be able to scrap something I 've put hours of effort into .
A lot of times , you work all that time to maybe give your mind some liberated state that allows you to do the very best job that you can do .
A panel from " Commander Crisp "
since cartoonist Nicholas Gurewitch entered semi-retirement .
But he 's working on a movie , a TV show — and he even made a surreal appearance on a Fox News interview show .
And he 's left behind a message for his fans , tucked away in plain sight in the comic strip Catch Phrase .
" There 's no secret message , " Gurewitch told us last week .
" There 's an overt message perhaps .
That sometimes Life can pigeonhole a person .
" That 's something I personally believe is a danger ...
" So in the last 13 months , the 25 - year - old cartoonist has drawn just that one strip while he explores even bigger mediums .
" I 'm very , very excited to imagine either of the films I 'm working on being made , " Nicholas told 10 Zen Monkeys .
" I might very well post production materials for them on my web site in the near future .
" I have n't been home in three weeks because I 've been script - writing with friends .
" And Wednesday he finally released what may be the final collection of his Perry Bible Fellowship strips .
It contains " a heck of a lot more , " Nicholas told Publisher 's Weekly , and the book 's official site lists out bonus features like unpublished " lost " strips and original sketches , plus Nicholas 's revealing behind - the - scenes interview with Wondermark cartoonist David Malki .
An earlier collection , The Trial of Colonel Sweeto , will be discontinued , and this book is " more of a deluxe edition , " says Darkhorse Publishing 's publicity coordinator , promising there 's more than 20 strips that were n't in the first volume , " so its a more complete library .
" They warn that this will probably be the final collection of Nicholas 's work , though in December the cartoonist told us he was " taking it easy , preparing some ideas , " and in last week 's email promised " I 'll probably be posting a new PBF soonish . "
( The site was offline briefly in December , but only because " my Australian server guy fell on hard times . " )
And in this book , " Nicholas went through and talked about a lot of the process he was going through , " according to Jacquelene Cohen , a publicist at Dark Horse publishing .
" He put a lot of thought into his inspiration .
" Working in two countries , Nicholas prepared a pilot TV show for British television while also retouching his strips for the book and remastering their colors .
In fact , the book 's publication date was delayed six months while Nicholas gave it the same lavish attention as his web comic .
" He really wanted to be thorough and give each strip the time it deserves , " remembers Cohen , saying only that he committed " a painstaking number of hours put into making this as special as it could be .
" And the TV show ?
It would be a series of sketches — including at least one based on the surprise - hazing strip Weeaboo .
" The guys at the company that produced it — Endemol — fought hard to make sure that comic was adapted , " Nicholas told us last week .
" Most of the material is sparkling new .
I wrote it with my friends . "
And the scriptwriting received expert supervision by one of the writers of the surreal British comedy show Look Around You , Robert Popper .
" He was a great guy , " adds Nicholas .
The BBC and the rival Channel 4 network are both reviewing the show now .
( " I 've been told that the hurting economy has hindered the speed of their decision - making , " Nicholas notes — but he says that both networks are still interested in it . )
In fact , Nicholas had already experimented with making movies out of some of his most famous strips , including New Specs for Ken and A Kiss For Joe ( a two - minute film in which Nicholas himself makes an appearance ) .
Last week Nicholas told us he's now working on the script for a feature length film ( along with his friend Jordan Morris ) .
" My buddy Jordan is always really good about knowing how I should amplify an idea , " Nicholas says , " and he 's come up with ideas [ for the strip ] on his own .
We 're all kind of on the same wavelength collaborating , and it 's extremely easy . "
Nicholas explained to one interviewer that " When we ’re both giddy with laughter , I can tell we ’re on to something good .
" Nicholas seems to have cinema - sized dreams — Juno screenwriter Diablo Cody even wrote the introduction for his new book — and Nicholas offered a simple explanation to the Daily Cross Hatch .
" I think a lot my ideas have grown so weird that I think I may need another medium for it . "
Nicholas has always been clear about his reasons for slowing the publishing schedule : " I want to do other things besides be a cartoonist . "
He discusses the transition in his book 's introduction , and Wondermark 's creator David Malki makes a provocative point —
" We 'll never know what kind of novels Charles M. Schulz could have written .
" Nicholas also uses the interview to suggest that he 's taking a lesson from the cartoonist who created The Far Side .
" I 'm sure Gary Larson had trained his brain by the peak of his career to derive the unbearable oddness of any slice of life .
Like , I 'm willing to bet that there 's a muscle in his brain that he just honed , so that he could see all of life a certain way ...
If he 's constantly looking at the world with that vision , and it's an honest vision , I do n't think he can do much wrong .
" But Nicholas also makes sure he acknowledges his admiration for Bill Watterson , the popular cartoonist who fiercely resisted merchandizing of his comic strip , Calvin and Hobbes .
( " Bill knows better than anyone the value of keeping your characters from appearing on things that get thrown away . " )
In the same spirit , Nicholas 's new book comes with a satin - red bookmark , and was designed with an eye for quality .
" This book will look great as a ( sick and twisted ) coffee table book , " wrote one reviewer on Amazon .
" It 's almost a shame to put it in a shelf as the cover is such eye candy ... " Dark Horse Publishing acknowledges that " We did n't really understand the potential of his first book , and it ended up being a major , major success . "
( Nearly 27,000 copies were sold before the collection was even released ! )
Jacquelene Cohen remembers that when Nicholas visited trade shows , " he would have lines wrapping down one aisle and then halfway down the next — people mobbing him for autographs and signed prints and books .
It was crazy — like mayhem .
" He loved it .
" It 's been 13 months since Nicholas reverted the strip to " a pace I 'm more comfortable with , " and over the summer he told interviewers that " I doubt they 'll have regular intervals .
But that 's something I 'll focus on as soon as I finish up work in these other areas . "
Fans may miss the strip , but Nicholas shares a secret in the new book — just how much care went into the online strips ( even after they 'd been published in newspapers ) .
" I think there 's about a hundred hours ' work difference between the ' Commander Crisp ' that I finished for the newspapers and the ' Commander Crisp ' that I finished for the web .
"
The last year suggests the same freedom may be growing from Nicholas 's entire Perry Bible Fellowship experience .
After seven years of laboring over the strip , it may become the first creative outburst that just unlocks an even greater one .
" I 'm never worried about scrapping something , " Nicholas says in his book .
" Because a lot of times that fragment that you labored over ends up finding a home in some other future work . "
This was forwarded to me by a friend .
It 's important to laugh , when the only other option is to cry .

Variable tracing with Xdebug
Skien , Norway
Some time ago Matthew mentioned on IRC that he'd like to see variable modifications in Xdebug 's function traces .
After I had a quick look at the feasibility of this feature I spend some time on implementing it for Xdebug 's HEAD branch that is going to become Xdebug 2.1 .
Variable modification tracing can be enabled by setting the php.ini xdebug.collect_assignments setting to 1 .
Of course this can also be done in either .htaccess or by using ini_set ( ) .
This setting requires general execution tracing to be enabled as well and it's only available for human readable trace files ( the default format ) .
If variable modification tracing is turned on , all variable assignments , as well as the update - in - place operators such as += and *= , are being logged to the trace file .
Take for example the following script :
1 <?php 2 function multiply ( $n , $ multiplier ) 3 { 4 $ val = $ n ; 5 $ val *= $ multiplier ; 6 return $ val ; 7 } 8 9 $ a = 3 ; 10 $ a = multiply ( $ a , 14 ) ; 11 ?>
There are multiple statements that modify variables ( on lines 4 , 5 , 9 and 10 ) .
Those statements generate lines in the execution trace file .
Combined with turning on xdebug.
collect_params and xdebug.collect_return the trace file then turns out to be :
TRACE START [ 2009-03-20 19:20:38 ] 0.0003 119632 -> {main} ( ) /tmp/example1.php:0 => $ a = 3 /tmp/example1.php:9 0.0004 120104 -> multiply ( 3 , 14 ) /tmp/example1.php:10 => $ val = 3 /tmp/example1.php:4 => $ val *= 14 /tmp/example1.php:5 >=> 42 => $ a = 42 /tmp/example1.php:10 >=> 1 0.0007 56360 TRACE END [ 2009-03-20 19:20:38 ]
Of course , this feature also works for updating object 's properties and array 's elements as can be seen with the following script :
1 <? php 2 class Number 3 { 4 private $ n ; 5 6 public function __construct ( $ n ) 7 { 8 $ this ->n = $ n ; 9 } 10 11 public function multiply ( $ multiplier ) 12 { 13 $ this ->n *= $ multiplier ; 14 } 15 } 16 $ a = new Number ( 3 ) ; 17 $ a-> multiply ( 14 ) ; 18 19 $ array [ ' 3x14 ' ] = $ a ; 20 ?>
And this creates the following trace file ( without the time and memory columns ) :
-> {main} ( ) /tmp/example2.php:0 -> Number->__construct(3 ) /tmp/example2.php:16 => $ this ->n = 3 /tmp/example2.php:8 >=> NULL => $ a = class Number { private $ n = 3 } /tmp/example2.php:16 -> Number -> multiply ( 14 ) /tmp/example2.php:17 => $ this ->n *= 14 /tmp/example2.php:13 >=> NULL => $ array ->3x14 = class Number { private $ n = 42 } /tmp/example2.php:19 >=> 1
At the moment , array keys and object properties both use the -> syntax in the trace files , but this might change in the future .
There are also still issues with syntax like $ this -> foo [ ' key ' ] .
Over the weekend , I gave over a few pleasurable hours to the absolute , white - hot rage you can only get from reading David Rees 's scorching , relentless , brilliant Get Your War On : The Definitive Account of the War on Terror , 2001 - 2008 , the omnibus edition collecting the full run of the strip .
Rees 's minimalist , clip - art graphics combined with his profane ( top marks for inspired and expressive use of the word ' fuck ' — next time an English teacher tells you cursing is n't an effective way of expressing yourself , produce this book and win the day ) torrent of raging , pitiless , vicious , relentless attacks on the stupidity of the War on Terror made GET YOUR WAR ON the single consistently credible voice during the Bush Years .
It 's easy to forget all the screw - ups that took place over that time — massive , fatal screw - ups , from Harriet Meier to Tom DeLay linking abortion to illegal immigration .
But who can forget Bionic Abu - Ghraib Man , or the vicious beating that Rees doled out to liberals who let themselves be cowed by " 9/11 changed everything " rhetoric ?
Rees 's gift for Bill - Hicks - like rhetoric set his strip apart from every other political cartoon I 've read — it 's like Doonesbury with Tourette's :
On US forces losing 380 tons of explosives to insurgents in Iraq : " Do you think Mohamed ElBaradei is currently running around with 380 tons of Schadenfreude ?
The worst thing about working at the IAEA is that nobody can hear you say ' I told you so . '
On account of all the explosions .
God , would n't it be ironing if the Iraq war somehow increased terrorism ?
Who could have predicted such irony ?
Maybe ninety percent of the world or something ? "
On Condoleeza Rice 's appointment to Secretary of State : " How can you not love our new Secretary of State ?
Have you ever heard her PLAY THE PIANO ?
Seriously , dude , she 's really good …
But I think her wonderful talent is best when applied to Chopin 's later works .
She draws out his whimsical melodies without over emphasizing the subharmonics of dead people and billions of dollars flushed down the fucking toilet . "
Terry Schvaio's feeding tube speaks : " ' Culture of Life ? '
You 're going to start legislating based on phrases stolen from herbal tea packaging ?
Why not ' Sleepytime Lemon Traditions ? '
Fuckin ' hold midnight congressional sessions about that you dumb fucks !
On Pat Robertson claiming that federal judges are a more serious threat to America than Al Qaeda , the 9/11 terrorists , Nazi Germany , Japan and the civil war : " So here 's my offer : I 'll spend a year in the company of federal judges if Pat Robertson will spend just a year in a Nazi concentration camp .
No , wait — I 'll actually fly on a 747 with federal judges if Pat Robertson will fly on a 747 with Islamic terrorists … "
" Stop making fun !
If you do n't … the federal judges have won ! "
On the White House 's response to the crisis in Darfur : " Come on , be fair .
Bush has sent tons of humanitarian aid over there . "
" Well , that 's a relief — nobody wants to be gang - raped on an empty stomach . "
On security theater : " How come the terror plots that lead to the worst airport inconveniences are the fuckin ' B - list , retarded terror plots that would never work ?
If I 'm gonna have to surrender my shoes or shampoo or whatever , at least let is be because people have actually been killed !
Enough of this theoretical bubblegum - missile bullshit ! "
" I wish someone would try to blow up a plan using New Age music , so I would n't have to sit and listen to that shit while people are boarding . "
" Do you think we could pay a terrorist to try to kill infidels using some kind of ' lack of legroom in coach ' bomb ? "
On Hurricane Katrina : " How did you celebrate the two - year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina ? "
" I floated face - down in my pool for a couple days , contemplating all the people who do n't give a shit about me . "
" I went into ' White House Crisis Mode : ' I rolled up my sleeves and stuck my thumb up my ass . "
On Blackwater : " Who would 've thought we'd see an accusation of too much deadly force from a firm called ' Blackwater ? '
The fuckin ' name only sounds like an evil wizard 's military compound . "
" Why not just call themselves Deathfang 's Midnight Posse of Merciless Skull Warriors ? "

The government says the VAT cut will help low - income families
The government 's attempts to boost the economy by temporarily cutting VAT have been an " unbelievable and expensive failure " , David Cameron has said .
The Tory leader pointed to figures suggesting shopper numbers were down in December , in a BBC interview .
Latest mortgage approval figures showed the stamp duty holiday for homes under £ 175,000 was not working , he added .
The government says it is offering help to families and accuses the Tories of being a " do nothing party " .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown argues that while he has brought forward plans to recapitalise the banks , bring forward public spending , cut VAT and increase child tax credit and payments to pensioners , the Conservatives would " do nothing and let the recession take its course " .
I think this will go down in history as one of the most appalling wastes of money in British political history
David Cameron
Conservative leader But Mr Cameron told Radio 2's Jeremy
Vine programme that the government 's plans to boost the housing market and encourage spending by a temporary 2.5 % VAT reduction , which came into effect in December , had not worked .
" The VAT cut has been an unbelievable and expensive failure , " he said .
" This government , that lectured us about prudence , has spent £ 12.5 bn of our money ... and wasted it . "

Firms ' destroyed '
Highlighting figures from the latest Retail Insight Report , suggesting retail footfall was down 3.1 % in December from a year earlier , he said : " I think this will go down in history as one of the most appalling wastes of money in British political history . "
He said Bank of England figures showing mortgage approvals fell to 27,000 in November - at least a nine - year low - also showed the stamp duty holiday was not boosting the housing market .
The government is completely paralysed at this crucial moment
Vince Cable
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Mr Cameron said the recapitalisation plan had not helped small businesses which were still unable to get access to affordable credit .
He repeated calls for a £ 50bn government national loan guarantee scheme to help them , to stop the credit crunch " destroying tens of thousands of good small businesses " .
Mr Cameron said his party would be arguing for a more " balanced " economy , encouraging saving " rather than just borrowing " , more manufacturing and a greener economy which was less reliant on oil .
' Empty promises '
But he also said the market system needed to be reformed to make it more " ethical " .
" Business is not just about making money .
It is also about acting in an ethical way and I think we need to build a more ethical capitalism in Britain as we come out of this dreadful recession . "
The Liberal Democrats said on Friday the mortgage approval figures suggested the " correction " in the housing market was " being exaggerated by the complete collapse of mortgage lending by the banks " .
" The government is completely paralysed at this crucial moment , " said Treasury spokesman Vince Cable .
" Ministers should consider promoting a simple , standardised mortgage with a market guarantee for the first few years of interest payments in order to help first - time buyers who can genuinely afford to take on home ownership . "
The government says the Conservatives are isolated as other countries around the world have followed UK policies on cutting taxes and raising borrowing to support the economy .
They also argue the VAT cut is the fairest way to get money into the economy because low - income households spend a larger share of their income on VAT than richer households .
Last week Secretary to the Treasury Angela Eagle accused the Conservatives of " empty promises " , adding : " It says something about their inability to move on from their 1980s ideology that they regard real help now - such as the £ 60 for pensioners , and the child benefit and child tax credit increases brought forward to 1 January - as state intervention to be opposed . "
But there has been some criticism from two German politicians and the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund of the decision to cut VAT from 17.5 % to 15 % until the end of 2009 .
The Liberal Democrats tried to get it overturned in a Commons debate in December .
Mr Cable said it was " seriously defective " as a way of getting money into the economy .

Gail Trimble can press a buzzer with alarming speed but , more importantly , she has a head full of a rich panoply of general knowledge that ranges across literature , languages , botany , and mathematical puzzles .
In all the decades University Challenge has been testing the wits of the nation ’s undergraduates , old hands are saying there has never been a contestant to match her .
Last night , she led her team , Corpus Christi College , to victory over Manchester University in the final of the six - month long general knowledge quiz show .
The result was quite close , by the standards of Corpus Christi , in that Manchester managed to chalk up a score of 190 to Corpus Christi ’s 275 .
It was the first time in the contest that the little Oxford college , which houses only 400 students , had failed to achieve a three - figure win .
This time , at least , their opponents held them down to just seven “ starter ” questions , making it less of an embarrassingly one - sided contest than Corpus Christi ’s appearance against Exeter University , which produced the most decisive win the show has seen since 1971 .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Corpus Christi’s success was almost entirely down to their captain , who has scored more points than her three teammates put together .
She has been nicknamed the new Stephen Fry , but that may be doing her an injustice .
Fry is clever , of course – but could he , without warning and without hesitation , answer questions ranging from what does Mathilda in a poem by Hilaire Belloc have in common with Miss Havisham , in the Charles Dickens novel Great Expectations , to a mathematical puzzle about the difference between 10 metres squared and 10 square metres ?
Because Ms Trimble , a 26 - year - old classicist , did .
Yesterday , Ms Trimble declared herself bemused by her new - found status as a sex symbol , a status allotted to her by some – but by no means all – of the bloggers who have commented about her on the web .
“ I ’m glad people are being nice about me rather than nasty , ” she told Radio 4 ’s Woman ’s Hour .
But she added : “ I very much think this would not be happening if I was a man .
People would not feel it necessary to comment on my looks so much . ”
She attributed the span of her knowledge to a stimulating childhood in a household filled with books , and to her “ amazingly supportive ” parents , who are both scientists , from Walton - on - Thames , in Surrey .
Ms Trimble was educated at a fee- paying school , Lady Eleanor Holles in Hampton , Middlesex , where she achieved 11 GCSEs – 10 at A * and one A – and four A - levels in Latin , Greek , English Literature and Maths – all grade A .
In her “ undergraduate profile ” on the Oxford University website , she is lyrical about the pleasures of learning Classics .
“ The best academic experiences tend to be completely unexpected – lectures on Plato ’s Symposium on Monday afternoons in the summer , given in a remote room somewhere in the orchards in Worcester , where we would hear brilliant thoughts on Plato as the sun streamed in and ducks walked past the window , ” she wrote .
On the radio yesterday , she confessed to gaps in her general knowledge that included any questions on biology or sport .
When challenged with a few pub quiz questions by a tabloid newspaper , she had to admit she could not name the manager of Chelsea FC , the winner of Celebrity Big Brother , nor even the British lead actor in Slumdog Millionaire .
( The answers , for those who also do not know , are Guus Hiddink , Ulrika Jonsson , and Dev Patel . )
By contrast , on hearing Jeremy Paxman read out a list of names , she instantly recognised them as characters from the works of Jane Austen .

Hey there , Another rough night fuggling with VCS - That 'll be my next post .
Tonight , I 'm going to tap a brain cell and leak whatever 's left of it down the drain ;)
Enjoy this little animation from ubergeek.tv .
I know it 's dated , which is why it caught my attention ( lots of flames out there ) .
I figure anything that upsets so many people so deeply " needs " to be on this blog at least once ;)

Somebody in the Republican Party thought it would be a great idea to send Joe the Plumber to Pennsylvania to rally against the Employee Free Choice Act .
The pretend plumber faced audiences so hostile in Pittsburgh and Harrisburg that he skipped a rally in Philadelphia .
This perfectly sums of the state of both Joe the Plumber ’s 15 minutes of fame , and the GOP .
Here is the report from KDKA about Joe in Pittsburgh :
Advertisements
Here is Joe in Harrisburg admitting that only knows a little about the issue :
These two videos pretty much sum up the intelligence of the Republican Party right now .
They send a fake plumber on a tour of an increasingly Democratic state to lobby against a bill that he readily admits he does n’t understand .
Not only do they send him to Pennsylvania , but they send him to three of the biggest pro-union areas in the state .
Even the conservative parts of Pennsylvania in the so called “ T ” have union roots due to the mining and manufacturing that used to be here .
I ca n’t begin to fully express what a stupid idea this was .
Joe could have had a nice little tour if he would have went to the conservative areas of the state , but to schedule him for a trip to the two biggest liberal strongholds was dense beyond belief .
Plus , Harrisburg as the state capitol has a huge number of public sector union members .
Pennsylvania is one of those states where the Employee Free Choice
Act is going to be popular with many people .
The latest Joe fiasco is another sign of the Republicans still do n’t get it .
The state Republican is mirroring the national GOP by moving further to the right , which explains why they are so eager to rid themselves of Arlen Specter .
Pennsylvania teased Republican presidential nominees for years , but it is not going to be in play in 2012 .
It has gone Democratic in 5 straight presidential elections .
There is a growing discussion about whether or not Pennsylvania should be classified as swing state anymore , so sending the intellectually ill equipped Joe the Plumber into such hostile territory reeks of detachment , desperation , and stupidity .
Right now those three adjectives could also be used to sum up the state of the Republican Party .
Glenn Beck had one of his famous schizoid embolisms today .
Among other things , he seriously claimed that the national debt is " one and a quarter quadrillion dollars . "
At around 2:47 in the video below , he totally loses his shpadoinkle and starts screaming and karate chopping his desk .
And finally , did you notice the teleprompter ?
Beck on March 25 :
So I mean , it really bothers me , this teleprompter . …
It bothers me that this man does n’t — this man is always on prompter .
You want to talk about a Manchurian candidate — that ’s it !
Who ’s writing every word for this man ? [ … ]
Is it bothering anyone else but me ?
We have a fraud in office , at least that ’s the way it feels to me .
LeTourneau U project -
not DARPA
( click for more ) A February 2008 Pentagon DefenseLINK story touted the progress of prosthetic limb development , fueled by a combination of combat need and the steadily advancing capabilities inherent in modern electronics and robotics .
Army Col. Geoff Ling manages DARPA ’s Revolutionizing Prosthetics programs .
For instance , researchers at Dean Kamen ’s DEKA Research and Development Corp. in Manchester , NH ( inventors of the Segway , the stair - climbing iBot wheelchair , and those PowerSwim fins that I want ) , have developed a “ strap - and - go- arm ” that requires no surgery , just 1 - 2 hours of training .
The process of picking up a pen , key , coffee cup , or power drill obviously differs .
Embedded electronics in DEKA ’s arm enable the wearer to activate a switch with a foot or chin , to cycle through 5 different gripping actions to match the task at hand .
One tester who lost his arm at the shoulder was reportedly able to field strip and reassemble an M - 16 rifle using the prosthesis , which comes in 3 models : [ 1 ] amputees who have lost a complete arm , [ 2 ] amputations above the elbow , and [ 3 ] amputations below the elbow .

A recent program begins the first large - scale testing of an advanced artificial arm that can pick up a key or hold a pencil …

By early 2008 , the US Department of Veterans Affairs , the National Institute of Health and the Food and Drug Administration had all shown interest in the program .
They were expected to join forces with the Defense Department in the months ahead , and getting a governmental agreement in place would be a big step forward to getting the devices mass - produced .
DEKA Follow -ons
May 29/09 : The Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) announces a 3 - year study , marking the first large - scale testing of of an advanced artificial arm that easily allows those with severe limb loss to pick up a key or hold a pencil .
Veterans fitted with the arm will provide feedback to refine the prototype , before it is commercialized and made generally available through the VA health care system .
Dr. Linda Resnik at the Providence , RI , Veteran ’s Affairs Medical Center will direct the study , in collaboration with DARPA .
This arm ’s control system uses an array of sensors embedded in a shoe ; wearers maneuver the arm by putting pressure on different parts of the foot .
The current version uses wires , but future versions will be wireless , and can also be adapted to work with other control systems like in - body myoelectric switches .
The V.A. release adds :
“ Frederick Downs Jr. , director of VA ’s Prosthetic and Sensory Aids Service who lost his left arm during combat in Vietnam , said he was “ brought to tears ” recently when the prosthetic arm allowed him to smoothly bring a water bottle to his mouth and drink .
“ Learning to use the controls is not difficult , ” he said , due in part to a sensor in the artificial hand that sends a vibration signal that tells how strong the grip is .
A stronger grip causes more vibration . ”
Feb 20/09 : DEKA Integrated Solutions Corporation in Manchester , NH a $ 7.1 million cost - plus fixed - fee contract to refine a novel upper extremity prosthetic device to meet the needs of injured soldiers , and to pursue Food & Drug Administration approval for the final medical device .
Work is to be performed at Manchester , NH , with an estimated completion date of Feb 8 / 2011 .
One bid was solicited and one bid received by the U.S. Army Research Office , Research , Development & Engineering Command Contracting Center – RTP Division in Triangle , NC ( W911NF - 09 - C-0035 ) .

More startup perf work ; I have a few ideas
With JRuby 1.2 almost out the door , I want to talk a bit about where we should go with JRuby 1.3 .
There 's always more work to do , but in this case there 's a few different directions we could probably go .
Some obvious items will continue to see work :
But there 's other areas that we may want to prioritize :
And there 's a number of internal chores to work on too :
As always , there 's way more tasks than the few of us committing to JRuby can work on , so I think we need to hear from users what 's important .
Any of these ?
Other items ?
I just learned about a new biogerontology journal : AGING , described on its website as “ an open - access Impact journal on aging ” .
( The word “ Impact ” in that phrase refers to the publisher , Impact Journals LLC , which at this point has no web site of its own , and of which AGING is the flagship — and sole — current title . )
The journal advertises “ Constructive peer - review , instant publication of accepted papers and Open access ” , and it ’s aims and scope also sound promising :
AGING publishes high - impact research papers of general interest and biological significance in all fields of aging research including but not limited to cellular senescence , DNA damage and repair , organismal aging , age - related diseases , genetic control of aging from yeast to mammals , regulation of longevity , evolution of aging , anti-aging strategies and drug development and especially the role of signal transduction pathways in aging and potential approaches to modulate these signaling pathways to extend lifespan .
How “ high - impact ” will be defined is an open question , especially as it might be distinguished from other types of studies .
I ’d be interested to see the instructions send to reviewers .
The concept is elaborated but not exactly elucidated in this “ clarification ” :
AGING publishes high - impact research ( of outstanding significance and of ground - breaking discoveries ) free for the authors ( no page charges , no color fees , no submission or any other fees ) .
For the first 3 issues , we also consider for publication ( free for the authors too ) regular , high quality papers that are scientifically - sound and well technically performed .
After 3 months , only high - impact research will be published ( free for the authors ) as Priority Reports .
The journal has a policy for the archiving of journal ’s content in the PubMed Central Archive ( pending ) or another recognized archiving resource .
I ’m mystified by the distinction between “ regular , high - quality papers ” and “ high - impact research ” , but I suppose that this will become more clear in three months , at which time the wheat will be separated from the chaff .
( They ’re already up to Issue 2 , so I ’m assuming that the next issue is the last one in which merely “ regular , high - quality ” but low - impact material will appear . )
In any case : I ’m not sure whether the world needs another specialized journal , but if we ’re going to have one anyway , I ’m glad to see that it ’s a proud member of the Open Access movement .
( One upshot of this is that every reader of this blog — everyone in the world — will be able to read the articles in AGING , even if they do n’t have access to a university library or the resources to purchase expensive subscriptions . )
Hopefully we ’ll see AGING give the field ’s most prominent specialized journal , the non-OA Aging Cell , a run for its money .

Do n’t get me wrong : I have the utmost respect for Sun ’s stewardship of the bottom two - thirds of the Java ecosystem .
The Java VM spec , Memory Model , HotSpot and significant chunks of the Java runtime library are world - class .
But Java - the - language ?
Scala , C# , Clojure , Haskell and every other language whose designers and managers are not cringingly risk - averse are beating it up and stealing its lunch money every damned day , and instead of fighting back , Sun is shopping for big dark glasses to hide the bruises .
Update :
This article was posted to dzone where some additional discussion has taken place .
Last week , we discovered that a bunch of military bases – especially Air Force bases – were blocking TroopTube , the Pentagon 's YouTube knock - off .
Today , we learned that the digital blockades were part of a larger , Air Force - wide decision to cut off access to the military 's taxpayer - funded , security - scrubbed , low - bandwidth - optimized video sharing site .
" The Air Force must balance network security requirements with competing requests for wide - ranging access to a vast array of public internet services for our Airmen .
Air Force - wide policy restricts access to categories of sites that are generally not mission related , and put adverse performance demands on our networks .
As a result of this general policy , access to Troop Tube is blocked at Air Force bases , " service spokesman Major David Small e-mails Danger Room .
U.S. President Barack Obama smiles during his prime time news conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington , March 24 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Jason Reed
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Altruism , not a lower tax bill , should be reason for donating to charity , President Barack Obama said on Tuesday .
“ If it ’s really a charitable contribution , I ’m assuming that that should n’t be the determining factor as to whether you ’re giving that $ 100 to the homeless shelter down the street , ” Obama told a nationally televised news conference .
Under the plan announced in Obama ’s budget in February , tax deductions for charitable contributions from people earning $ 250,000 a year or more would be limited to 28 percent , down from 35 percent .
Charity groups worry that the change will reduce giving at a time when demand for their services is rising because of the recession .
Obama said it would simply bring the tax benefits for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans in line with everyone else who gives to soup kitchens , medical research groups and other charities .
“ It ’s not going to cripple them .
They ’ll still be well - to - do , ” he said .
The weak economy would do more to discourage charitable giving than any changes to the tax code , Obama said .
“ The most important thing that I can do for charitable giving is to fix the economy , to get banks lending again , to get businesses opening their doors again , to get people back to work again .
Then I think charities will do just fine , ” he said .
Estimated donations in the United States reached $ 306 billion in 2007 and seven out of 10 households gave to charitable causes , according to Indiana University ’s Center on Philanthropy .
Programming necessitates variables .
There ’s no getting around it .
Some thing needs to remember the number of widgets or the name of a particular widget .
Simple programs usually start with simple variable names :
a=3 ; b=" Deluxe Widget " ;
a and b are variables that hold the values 3 and “ Deluxe Widget ” respectively .
As a program gets more complicated and the number of variables increases , the variable names get more complex .
Many times the name should be more than one word , like “ widget count , ” but for various reasons , this is not allowed .
So we programmers get clever with underscores :
widget_count=3 ; widget_name= " Deluxe Widget " ;
Or perhaps use camelCase ( I guess they look like camels with all of the humps ? ) :
widgetCount=3 ; widgetName= " Deluxe Widget " ;
Arguments over variable naming conventions are common .
It ’s petty , but so are programmers .
Either way , something has to be done .
I like camelCase .
I rarely use it .
Why not ?
Because I use Emacs to edit my files .
Emacs has keystrokes that allow you to delete a single “ word ” all at once .
Hold down the alt key , hit delete and Emacs deletes an entire word .
It also allows you to move your cursor forwards and backwards word by word .
The problem is how Emacs defines what a word is .
If I want to delete or change part of a variable name ( which happens all the time ) it works fine with underscore separated variable names , but not with camelCase .
When I use camelCase naming , I ’m resigned to constantly retyping entire variable names .
Until now !
After the topic came up on twitter today , I decided that there had to be a solution .
Emacs is built to be extended and it has been .
There are modules and add - ons to do everything .
Literally .
You can even play Tetris in Emacs .
So I looked around and immediately found this .
A minor mode for Emacs that provides key bindings for camelCase !
I dropped it into my personal Emacs directory and set it up to load when ever any file was opened .
This is done in my .emacs file ( it ’s LISP and a little ugly ) :
;; Include my personal Emacs Directory when looking for files to load ( setq load - path ( cons " ~/Dropbox/.emacs.d " load - path ) ) ;; Load the camelCase file ( load " camelCase - mode " ) ;; Start camelCase - mode whenever a file is ' found ' ( opened ) ( add - hook ' find - file - hook '( lambda ( ) ( camelCase - mode 1 ) ) )
That should have done it .
However , when I started up Emacs , I got the following error :
Error in init file : Symbol 's function definition is void : first
I dug into the camelCase file and found the problem buried in the function that maps the new key bindings :
( define - key map ( first binding ) ( second binding ) ) )
binding is a list that contains two things : a keystroke sequence and what should happen on that keystroke .
What ’s wrong here is that to get the first and second items , the functions first and second are called .
These functions do n’t exist within Emacs !
Initially , I fixed this directly within the camelCase file .
Then I decided that I ’d rather leave that file untouched .
In order to make it work , I needed to define first and second as functions that do what camelCase expects .
So I added the function definitions to my .emacs file .
The final result looks like this :
;; Include my personal Emacs Directory when looking for files to load ( setq load - path ( cons " ~/Dropbox/.emacs.d " load - path ) ) ;; Define ' first ' to return the first element of a list .
( defun first ( argList ) " Return the first element of a list " ( nth 0 argList ) ) ;; Define ' second ' to return the second element of a list ( defun second ( argList ) " Return the second element of a list " ( nth 1 argList ) ) ;; Load the camelCase file ( load " camelCase - mode " ) ;; Start camelCase - mode whenever a file is ' found ' ( opened ) ( add - hook ' find - file - hook '( lambda ( ) ( camelCase - mode 1 ) ) )
And that works just fine !
I expect to start using camelCase variable names far more often now .
UPDATE : Original DISQUS Comments
To most people , Pepsi ’s new logo looks a lot like the old one .
To the ad firm that conceived it , however , the revamped logo draws on thousands of years of design principles , the Earth ’s gravitational pull and the greatest works of art to persuade people to buy soda .
Last year , Pepsi tapped the Arnell Group , run by founder Peter Arnell and owned by ad giant Omnicom , to handle the redesign , which experts estimated cost more than $ 1 million to create and hundreds of millions more to plaster on packaging , signs and promotions .
The new logo is similar to the old red - white - and - blue globe except there is a white band in the center that is supposed to resemble a smile .
It ’s not exactly revolutionary , but try telling that to Arnell , which wrote a lofty treatise designed to sell Pepsi on the idea .
That document , which was leaked onto the Web , is now being held up as an example of what ails the ad industry .
Critics called it the worst kind of puffery , a waste of marketing dollars and proof that the ad industry just does n’t “ get ” the consumer .
The document was originally posted on reddit.com , where it generated more than 500 comments , most of them taking the ad industry and self - important “ creative ” types to task .
The individual who posted the presentation , purportedly a freelancer for one of Pepsi ’s ad agencies , said , “ It really hammers in the stereotype of advertising in general , and the complete idiocy that goes in to marketing . ”
The document , called “ Breathtaking Design Strategy , ” is littered with historical , philosophical , scientific and mathematical ideas dating back to 3000 BC .
It references the Golden Ratio , Feng Shui and Einstein ’s Special Theory of Relativity .
At one point , the presentation compares “ Planet Pepsi ” to the Earth ’s magnetic pull , with diagrams showing Pepsi as the gravitational force between the end of the aisle and the checkout stand .
And it does n’t stop there .
The beverage goes from being the center of the Earth to the center of the universe .
“ It ’s sort of like the rings of hell in Dante ’s ‘ Inferno , ’ ” said Mark DiMassimo , a partner at New York ad firm DiMassimo Goldstein .
“ There are rings of b.s. in the marketing and advertising business .
This is an extreme example of design - focused , brand - identity bull . ”
A spokesman for Peter Arnell declined to comment .
This is the second time Pepsi ’s logo has drawn some unfavorable comments .
When it debuted just before the inauguration , some critics thought the logo was too similar to President Barack Obama ’s “ O ” campaign logo .
“ We ’re very happy with the new look of the logo , ” said Nicole Bradley , a Pepsi spokeswoman .
“ The new design and our packaging have a clean , contemporary look that has been very well received by our consumers . ”

" Our experience in the aftermath of the Annapolis conference has proven that Israel is still a ways off from abandoning its settlement policy and choosing the path of peace , " Mahmoud Abbas said Monday .
Peace Negotiations Final offer : J'lem concessions and settler evictions Roni Sofer Olmert explains offer from Sept. 2008 , to which Abbas has yet to respond , which would grant Palestinians 93 % of W. Bank and parts of the capital Final offer : J'lem concessions and settler evictions
Speaking at the Arab summit in Doha , Qatar the Palestinian president said that at the same time it was conducting negotiations on a permanent peace agreement Israel " continued to establish facts on the ground in accordance with its ambitions of expansion . "
Abbas said " the construction of the " racist wall ( security barrier ) , the Israeli blockade , the Judaizing of Jerusalem and the imprisonment of 11,000 Palestinians have turned the lives of the West Bank 's residents into a living hell . "
Turning his attention to Israel 's recent military offensive in Gaza , the Palestinian leader said the IDF employed " every one of its war machines against helpless civilians , " and accused Israel of destroying thousands of homes , schools and mosques .
" This criminal war proved that the Israeli government has chosen the path of aggression and settlement instead of peace , " he said .
As for Benjamin Netanyahu 's incoming government , Abbas said the Palestinian Authority was closely following " the rise of extremist forces " in Israel , and stated once again that adopting the Arab peace initiative was the only way of achieving peace in the region .
" I suggest that with the conclusion of this summit we begin talks with the representatives of the Mideast Quartet ( US , Russia , UN and EU ) , particularly with Barack Obama 's administration , and demand that they pressure Israel into choosing the path of peace , " Abbas said .
Ron Paul : Congress ' drinks a lot of alcohol ' but wo n't legalize pot David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Saturday March 14 , 2009
Print This Email This Members of Congress like to guzzle the booze , but when it comes to the questions of drugs and states ' rights , do n't ask them for a friendly ear .
That 's the overriding message carried by Texas Republican Congressman Ron Paul on a Friday night appearance with Stephen Baldwin on CNN 's Larry King Live .
Paul , who appeared on the show with Baldwin apparently on short notice , at first appeared ill - prepared for the topic .
Guest host Joy Behar , having played a clip of Olympian Michael Phelps ' public apology for the infamous photo of him holding a water pipe , asked for the congressman 's thoughts .
" I 'm sorry , over the what ? "
Paul asked .
" The photo , " said Behar .
" The Michael Phelps photo .
What was your reaction to all that , what happened with Michael Phelps ?
I mean , he basically lost a lot of his endors ... "
" Oh ! " Paul exclaimed .
" Meh .
That whole thing is a mess .
I think it 's outrageous .
We 're getting carried away with the War on Drugs .
That 's how silly the whole thing gets . "
Arguing from a self - titled " faith - based , conservative perspective " was Stephen Baldwin .
The choice of Baldwin is particularly odd considering he 's appeared in so - called " stoner movies " before , such as Half Baked , where he played the " MacGyver Smoker , " and the attempted comedy Bio Dome , where he co-starred with similarly famed actor Pauly Shore .
Calling his efforts part of " two very popular marijuana films , " Baldwin even acknowledged his filmography as a point of credibility to bolster his argument that " marijuana leads to doing worse things . "
" That 's just a fact , " claimed Baldwin .
" I do n't care what anybody says .
What the debate is .
If you smoke marijuana at a young age , that 'll usually lead to alcohol abuse and harder drugs . "
Paul dismissed his concern as " silly . "
" The most addictive drug in the country , in the world , is nicotine , " he said .
" Nobody talks about nicotine being a gateway drug , so there 's no sense to that .
And besides , [ marijuana ] is not nearly as addictive as alcohol .
If you 're a consistent person and you think the government should be regulating personal behavior , you should be in favor of prohibition of alcohol . "
Attributing the earlier prohibition for the creation of " the Al Capone 's , " he drew a clear connection between current prohibition policies in the US and the escalating cartel war in Mexico .
" You know the people who benefit most by these laws ? " he asked .
" These are the drug cartels .
They lobby to keep these laws in place because they can't exist without them . "
On the next point , medical marijuana , Baldwin suggested alternatives such as " lots of pain relieving practices that people can study . "
But , he also seemed to bear a tolerance for terminally - ill patients smoking marijuana as prescribed by a doctor .
But , Baldwin insisted , legalizing marijuana would drive up the number of impaired drivers on the roads , resulting in untold deaths " just so we can tax it . "
" I understand there 's a few people who smoke marijuana already , " said Paul , laughing .
" And , how many times have you seen someone arrested for driving under the influence of marijuana ?
I mean , I 've never heard of it !
Driving under the influence of alcohol ...
That is dangerous . "
Paul attributed current laws to a widespread fear of political retribution in Congress , among many members who " drink a lot of alcohol " at that .
" Are you saying that there are a lot of alcoholics in Congress ? " asked guest host Joy Behar .
Paul backpedaled .
" I said there 's a lot of people in Congress who drink a lot of alcohol . "
" They wo n't vote to legalize it , " he added with a laugh .

A 13 - year - old girl scored and impressive , if unintentional , almost literal bullseye on her schoolmate , an 11 - year - old boy , in a spot of recent archery practice .
Miraculously , the boy survived the arrow burying itself deep into his brain and destroying his eye .
The accident occurred in archer practice at the school gym , when the girl pointed her bow at the boy and apparently accidentally loosed an arrow into him .
The arrow flew true , and entered his skull to a depth of 10 cm by way of his eye - socket , apparently lodging in the very centre of his brain .
The unfortunate human target was immediately rushed to hospital , where he underwent emergency neurosurgery .
Needless to say , he suffered some brain damage .
In spite of this grievous injury , doctors pronounced the operation a miraculous success , and the boy has regained consciousness and is said to be recuperating .
The girl responsible is said to have pointed the bow at him as a joke , but her hand slipped and her arrow found its mark .
She joined the boy ’s parents in a vigil over the boy whilst he was comatose .
The boy ’s family is poor and it appears the cost of treatment will burden them greatly all the same .
For its part , the school is cancelling archery practice and stressing to children the importance of safety .
Via Heaven .
You may recall the earlier almost identical case which occurred in Japan as opposed to China ; if you were wondering how a child could possibly survive such an injury , it seems to be more common than one might think …
NO ONE really knows how fast global warming will make the oceans rise .
But what is clear is that south - east Louisiana is sinking , rather rapidly by geological standards .
Add in the prevalence of hurricanes in the neighbourhood , and it becomes a dangerous place to live .
Land subsidence in the Mississippi delta is largely caused by human interference .
When the river was allowed to flood over its banks every year , some of the muck that spilled out remained , creating more and higher land nearby .
( It is because of this that the highest ground in New Orleans , counter - intuitively , is along the riverfront , one of the only areas of town not to flood after Hurricane Katrina . )
Levees have changed that .
Until Katrina , the Mississippi had not flooded in or around the city in almost 80 years .
During that period , swampy lands in the region began to be drained for development .
As the moisture was sucked out of it , the ground naturally sank , and without the once - annual dose of Mississippi mud , the sinking continued .
Scientists now think south - east Louisiana may sink between two and six feet ( up to two metres ) over the next century , and that perhaps half of that will be caused by subsidence .
If they are right , New Orleans and its suburbs will become thin strips of low land walled off by levees and surrounded by open water on three sides , much more vulnerable than they were when Katrina struck .
This grim outlook , the subject of a recent series in the Times - Picayune , has reignited debate about how to protect the area from the sea , and how much to spend doing it .
In the eyes of most south Louisianans , the federal government has been a bit stingy when it comes to reinforcing flood defences .
Levee improvements are going on at the moment , but until they are finished New Orleans is vulnerable .
Last year , though it did no major damage , Hurricane Gustav sent sea waves spilling over floodwalls in the heart of the city .
There have been some victories .
The Army Corps of Engineers , the federal agency responsible for coastal defences , has successfully installed a couple of diversion projects , which push muddy river water into nearby marshland in an effort to mimic the land - building effect of the old springtime floods .
They seem to work , but many more are needed , and soon .
What is clear is that an expensive , co-ordinated , all - hands - on - deck effort will be required to beat back the forces of nature in south - east Louisiana .
That has yet to happen .
Instead , plans have either been modest or have failed to get funding .
One of the most successful diversions , near the river 's mouth , is now in danger of being shut down because the shipping industry has complained that it is silting up a useful anchorage .
The Corps of Engineers , meanwhile , has failed to produce plans for higher levees and coastal restoration that would provide so - called “ Category 5 ” protection , as Congress has demanded .
Louisianans hope that the national infrastructure campaign Barack Obama wants to implement will include a healthy dose of levee - and wetland - building .
In the meantime , the region continues to lose minute but measurable ground to the Gulf of Mexico every month .

Editor 's note : Penn Jillette -- the larger , louder half of Penn & Teller -- is a magician , comedian , actor , author and producer .
Penn Jillette says counterintuitive actions sometimes work -- and other times fail spectacularly .
( CNN ) -- Counterintuitive action makes a fellow feel smart .
When I first got my driver 's license , I took my old Ford Falcon into the Greenfield Public High School parking lot when it was freshly covered with fresh powder on top of wet slippery Western Massachusetts snow and ice .
I turned fast , gunned it and lost control of the car in a skid .
I turned into the skid and instantly gained control of my car .
Telling someone to turn into a skid , that 's crazy talk .
It seems so wrong , but my Dad knew it worked .
Dad suggested I do it over and over in the parking lot , so I would conquer my intuition to be ready when a real emergency arose on a real road .
Counterintuitive actions prove we can trust real knowledge and do the opposite of what we feel makes sense .
I 'm a fire - eater .
There is some technique to fire - eating , but most of the practice goes into learning that one 's mouth is wet enough , most of the heat goes up enough , and cutting the oxygen leg off the fire triangle ( it 's now a fire tetrahedron , but I learned fire - eating a long time ago ) with one 's mouth really does put the fire out .
It took watching a professional whom I trusted do it -- a lot of trust and a lot of practice -- before my first reaction , when my mouth started to burn from the lit torch in my mouth , was to put the torch deeper in my mouth , close my mouth around the torch and put it out .
Handling fire seems like a superpower .
There are whole seminars and self - help jive centered on fire - walking , which is hustled as " mind over matter , " or " empowerment " but is really just counterintuitive physics .
As long as the fire walk is set up right and you keep moving , you can even hope and pray to be burned , while yelling counter - self - help slogans such as " I do not have any power to do this " and " universe , please burn my little piggies , " and you 'll be fine .
Whether it's fire walking or knowing that the Earth is round , everyone seems to dig counterintuitive thinking .
Many dig it when our president explains we 're going to spend our way out of debt .
That 's way against all the intuition we 've developed in our adult lives .
Spending our way out of debt does n't work often , does it ?
It 's crazy talk .
Did n't a lot of people try that spending out of debt thing ?
I live in Vegas , and I see people by the side of the road with cardboard signs who seem like they might have tried that spending their way out of debt thing .
Or maybe they tried the all too intuitive " crack will make me feel healthy again " thing .
I do n't know .
Did n't lots of people try piling up debt on credit cards and buying houses they could n't afford in hopes of solving all their financial problems ?
I 've tried spending more than I was going to earn ( remember , I was carny trash , that 's why I know how to eat fire ) , and it way did n't work .
Spending more money than I had to spend put me more in debt , just like my silly intuition warned me .
President Obama is so damn smart .
He just drips smart .
He clearly understands stuff that we could never understand .
He 's trustworthy .
If Obama were teaching fire - eating , we would all learn fast .
If he told you that the burns would be minor and the fire would go out when you closed your mouth , you 'd believe him .
If I were n't twice his weight , I 'd fall back with my eyes closed into his caring arms in one of those cheesy ' 70s church trust exercises .
He could talk me into anything .
Obama tells us that we can spend our way out of debt .
He tells us that even though the government had control over the banks and did nothing to stop the bad that 's going on , if we give them more control over more other bank - like things , then they can make sure bad stuff does n't happen ever again .
He says we can get out of all those big wars President Bush caused by sending more troops into Afghanistan .
And I do n't know .
I really do n't know .
I trusted my Dad that turning into a skid would work .
I trusted my carny mentor , Doc Swan , that closing my mouth around a burning torch would put it out .
They were right .
Maybe the United States borrowing more money than I could imagine in a billion years with a billion computers and a billion monkeys typing on them , will get us out of financial trouble .
I really do n't know .
It 's certainly true that many counterintuitive things are true , and when you have the guts to do something counterintuitive that works , it 's really cool .
It 's a superpower under our yellow sun .
But there are some things that are just intuitive .
Did you know , that if you 're going 100 mph , directly at a very , very thick , reinforced concrete wall , and you speed up , so you 're accelerating right when you hit the wall that the accident you have is going to be much worse than if you 'd jammed on the brakes as soon as you saw the wall at the end of the street ?

Arab pop music is bold and brash .
Its sensibilities straddle Cairo 's middle class propriety and Hollywood 's freewheeling hip - shaking .
Turn the TV dial to one of a dozen music video channels and you find a rare sea of exposed shoulders and bare midriffs in a town where most women are veiled .
Into this swirl of light and music steps Ahmed Abu Haiba , a self - described " media man " with a zabiba , or prayer bruise , on his forehead .
He is the founder and managing director of 4Shbab TV , billed as " Islam 's own MTV , " a satellite network with worldwide ambitions that launched Feb .
1 .
The idea behind 4 Shbab is simple , he says .
Mainstream music videos are " lewd " and do not represent the Arab world 's cultural values .
He says they are haram , or forbidden and sinful in Islam .
4 Shbab TV is Abu Haiba 's attempt to put young people back on the right path , he says , in a way that is fun and entertaining .
Music videos from around the world – not just " Islamic videos , " but anything that 's positive , he says – air alongside call - in shows and contests like " Who wants to be an Islamic pop star ? "
" Ask people in the street and they will tell you that these channels are something strange in our culture , " he says .
" They smash our identity and confuse people , especially the younger generation .
They give them a misunderstanding about their own lives .
" You see young men today wearing their hair in a ponytail and looking like young men from another culture , " he says .
The videos on 4Shbab do n't have the backup dancers and beach side sets of their mainstream counterparts .
In one , singer Sami Yusuf sits by a baby grand piano .
Something of a Cairo heartthrob , Mr. Yusuf 's song , " He is there , " celebrates the omnipresence of God without being religiously specific .
Mohamed Shawky , a filmmaker documenting 4 Shbab 's launch , says that despite the disconnect between music videos and real life here , most young people are n't willing to turn the channel .
" I think people do find most music videos to be very sexually suggestive and might think they are against their religion , but the irony is that they are also extremely popular , " he says .
" It 's possible that a lot of people agree with Abu Haiba 's views , but that does n't mean they will stop watching mainstream videos and start watching his channel . "
Drinking orange juice at a cafe along the Nile , Ismail Mohamed , a local university student , says he 's open to the idea of watching an Islamic video channel .
But for him , it would just be another network on the dial .
" Sure I would watch 4 Shbab , I like to watch a lot of different things , " he says .
" Music videos , American movies , I watch whatever looks cool . "
Diaa Rashwan , an expert on Islamism at the Ahram Center , a Cairo think tank , says that the idea of Islamic music videos is " not a new phenomenon .
" This is the expansion of a phenomenon in which Islamists and people close to their ideas try to [ carry ] their model of life into art , clothes , music and culture , " he says .
" It is part of a bigger trend : In Egypt over the last few years you have seen Coptic singers , and movies produced and performed by Coptic singers , actors , and actresses , " he says .
" It is a way for people to distinguish themselves from the society as a whole and to say ' we have our own way of life . ' "
Abu Haiba has been down this road before .
Early in his TV career he worked as a producer for the popular Islamic televangelist Amr Khaled , an affable non-preacher who rose to fame in the Arab world by talking about faith in an accessible and fun way .
Later , he helped start an Islamic variety channel called " Al Resala , " or " The Message . "
It was criticized by Islamists for not taking religion seriously enough .
Now , he has convinced investors from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates that 4Shbab could be both an ethical and a lucrative investment .
Religious channels typically get a small share of the viewing audience , but video channels bring a much higher return .
Experts say Abu Haiba is the first to combine the two .
Many Islamists are n't convinced by the numbers .
They remain unhappy with the very idea of Islamic music videos .
Abu Haiba admits the station has received " severe attacks . "
" They think what we are doing is haram , " he says .
Some women have criticized the network as well , for everything from its lack of female performers and presenters to its logo , the silhouette of a muscular young man walking toward the viewer .
He says that women need to be eased on to the network because their portrayal as gyrating dancers on other channels has given them a bad name .
4 Shbab aims to change that , " but that change is coming gradually . "
William Ward , the managing editor of Arab Media and Society , a online journal , says that 4 Shbab may appeal to both viewers and investors not because of Islam , but because it is family - friendly .
" It 's not necessarily about the Islamic nature of the channel , " he says , " it 's just a more wholesome alternative . "
Tonight one of the best science fiction programs in history finished its run on television ( for a detailed recap of the finale go here and , in theory answered all the big questions which have been knocking around in our brains for four seasons .
The answer ?
Oh it ’s God .
Showrunner Ron Moore finally got to douse us in his pro-god , anti-society , anti-technology philosophy .
His heavy religion agenda has always sort of hung around in the series ’ background , as the show reveled in mysticism and unexplained weirdness .
Tonight though he abandoned all pretense and used the series finale as his platform to deliver a big warning :
Holy shit the robots are coming !
Getting weirdly preachy would have been just fine , if only he ’d really come up with legitimate answers to the questions that have been hanging over fans ' heads for years now .
Why the frak does Baltar have an imaginary friend ?
Answer : It ’s God !
Why is n’t Starbuck dead and what the frak is she ?
Answer :
Oh it ’s God !
Why did the cylons destroy the colonies ?
Oh it ’s God !
How are the humans going to find a home ?
Oh it ’s God !
Every remaining question was answered tonight and the answer to every question was :
Oh it ’s God .
Look I ’m alright with Ron Moore working his own superstitious religious mumbo jumbo into his show if it ’s going to deliver the kinds of thoughtful programming and incredibly deep , well developed charactersgave us .
I have no problem with that .
What I do have a problem with is substituting random , unsupported theology for actual story closure .
What I do have a problem with is reducing everything to one big , Deus ex machina .
Sure theology has always been an important part of the show , but in the end it seems Moore ’s answer is that it ’s the only part of the show .
We ’ve hung around all this time , do n’t we deserve better answers than that ?
Frak that .
So we got screwed on the answer department .
I ’m a little disappointed and maybe you are too .
I ’m here to tell you that in the end , it does n’t matter .
It does n’t matter becausefinal moments will always be remembered for that brilliant , closing shot of William Adama sitting alone on a hill , promising the ghost of Laura Roslinn that he ’ll build her that cabin.final moments will be remembered as Apollo looking off into the endless sky and imagining a life of exploration and adventure .
final moments will be remembered as the Galactica sailing off into the sun .
Tonight ’sfinale was a cop out , but it was also the perfect goodbye .
Ron Moore dropped the ball on plot but as always , the show delivered where it really mattered : Characters .
Ignore the superstitious mumbo jumbo .
No one is going to remember all the awful stock footage of robots or the ridiculous , anti-technology plot device in which the entire fleet decides for no particular reason to abandon all technology and start using spears .
Scratch that , they had a reason .
Their souls were n’t ready for science .
Funny no one mentioned that notion until five minutes before the credits .
Frak all of that .
We ’ll remember the people , their faces , and the lives they ’ve touched .
Goodbye .
I do n’t care about the answers , you ’ve been a good ship .
Interview : the return of the realtime preemption tree
Did you know ...?
LWN . net is a subscriber - supported publication ; we rely on subscribers to keep the entire operation going .
Please help out by buying a subscription and keeping LWN on the net .
The realtime preemption project is a longstanding effort to provide deterministic response times in a general - purpose kernel .
Much code resulting from this work has been merged into the mainline kernel over the last few years , and a number of vendors are shipping commercial products based upon it .
But , for the last year or so , progress toward getting the rest of the realtime work into the mainline has slowed .
On February 11 , realtime developers Thomas Gleixner and Ingo Molnar resurfaced with the announcement of a new realtime preemption tree and a newly reinvigorated development effort .
Your editor asked them if they would be willing to answer a few questions about this work ; their response went well beyond the call of duty .
Read on for a detailed look at where the realtime preemption tree stands and what 's likely to happen in the near future .
LWN : The 2.6.29 - rc4-rt1 announcement notes that you 're coming off a 1.5 - year sabbatical .
Why did you step away from the RT patches so long ; have you been hanging out on the beach in the mean time ? :)
Thomas :
We spent a marvelous time at the x86 lagoon , a place with an extreme contrast of antiquities and modern art . :) :
We spent a marvelous time at the x86 lagoon , a place with an extreme contrast of antiquities and modern art . :)
Seriously , we underestimated the amount of work which was necessary to bring the unified x86 architecture into shape .
Nothing to complain about ; it definitely was and still is a worthwhile effort and I would not hesitate longer than a fraction of a second to do it again .
Ingo : Yeah , hanging out on the beach for almost two years was well - deserved for both of us .
We met Linus there and it was all fun and laughter , with free beach cocktails , pretty sunsets and camp fires . [
All paid for by the nice folks from Microsoft btw. , - those guys sure know how to please a Linux kernel hacker ! ;-) ]
So what has brought you back to the realtime work at this time ?
Thomas : Boredom and nostalgia :)
In fact I never lost track of the real time work since we took over x86 maintenance , but my effort was restricted to decode hard to solve problems and make sure that the patches were kept in a usable shape .
Right now I have the feeling that we need to put more development effort into preempt -rt again to keep its upstream visibility and make progress on merging the remaining parts .

Right now I have the feeling that we need to put more development effort into preempt -rt again to keep its upstream visibility and make progress on merging the remaining parts .
The most important reason for returning was of course our editors challenge in The Grumpy Editor 's guide to 2009 : " The realtime patch set will be mostly merged by the end of the year ... "
Ingo :
When we left for the x86 land more than 1.5 years ago , the -rt patch - queue was a huge pile of patches that changed hundreds of critical kernel files and introduced / touched ten thousand new lines of code .
Fast - forward 1.5 years and the -rt patchqueue is a humungous pile of patches that changes nearly a thousand critical kernel files and introduces / touches twenty - thirty thousand lines of code .
So we thought that while the project is growing nicely , it is useful and obviously people love it - the direction of growth was a bit off and that this particular area needs some help .
Initially it started as a thought experiment of ours : how much time and effort would it take to port the most stable - rt patch ( .26 - rt15 ) to the . 29 - tip tree and could we get it to boot ?
Turns out we are very poor at thought experiments ( just like we are pretty bad at keeping patch queues small ) , so we had to go and settle the argument via some hands - on hacking .
Porting the queue was serious fun , it even booted after a few dozen fixes , and the result was the .29 -rt1 release .
Maintaining the x86 tree for such a long time and doing many difficult conceptual modernizations in that area was also very helpful when porting the - rt patch - queue to latest mainline .
Most of the code it touched and most of the conflicts that came up looked strangely familiar to us , as if those upstream changes went through our trees =;-)
( It 's certainly nothing compared to the beach experience though , so we are still looking at returning for a few months to a Hawaii cruise . )
How well does the realtime code work at this point ?
What do you think are the largest remaining issues to be tackled ?
Thomas :
The realtime code has reached quite a stable state .
The 2.6.24/26 based versions can definitely be considered production ready .
I spent a lot of time to sort out a huge amount of details in those versions to make them production stable .
Still we need to refactor a lot of the patches and look for mainline acceptable solutions for some of the real time related changes . :

Ingo :
To me what settled quite a bit of " do we need - rt in mainline " questions were the spin-mutex enhancements it got .
Prior that there were a handful of pretty pathologic workload scenarios where - rt performance tanked over mainline .
With that it 's all pretty comparable .
The patch splitup and patch quality has improved too , and the queue we ported actually builds and boots at just about every bisection point , so it 's pretty usable .
A fair deal of patches fell out of the .26 queue because they went upstream meanwhile : tracing patches , scheduler patches , dyntick / hrtimer patches , etc .
It all looks a lot less scary now than it looked 1.5 years ago - albeit the total size is still considerable , so there 's definitely still a ton of work with it .
What are your current thoughts with regard to merging this work into the mainline ?
Thomas :
First of all we want to integrate the - rt patches into our - tip git repository which makes it easier to keep - rt in sync with the ongoing mainline development .
The next steps are to gradually refactor the patches either by rewriting or preferably by pulling in the work which was done in Stevens git -rt tree , split out parts which are ready and merge them upstream step by step . :

Ingo : IMO the key thought here is to move the - rt tree ' ahead of the upstream development curve ' again , and to make it the frontier of Linux R&D .
With a 2.6.26 basis that was arguably hard to do .
With a partly - 2.6.30 basis ( which the - tip tree really is ) it 's a lot more ahead of the curve , and there are a lot more opportunities to merge - rt bits into upstream bits wherever there 's accidental upstream activity that we could hang - rt related cleanups and changes onto .
We jumped almost 4 full kernel releases , that moves - rt across 1 year worth of upstream development - and keeps it at that leading edge .
Another factor is that most of the top - rt contributors are also - tip contributors so there 's strong synergy .
The - tip tree also undergoes serious automated stabilization and productization efforts , so it 's a good basis for development _and_ for practical daily use .
For example there were no build failures reported against .29 - rt1 , and most of the other failures that were reported were non-fatal as well and were quickly fixed .
One of the main things we learned in the past 1.5 years was how to keep a tree stable against a wild , dangerous looking flux of modifications .
YMMV ;-)
Thomas once told me about a scheme to patch rtmutex locks into / out of the kernel at boot time , allowing distributors to ship a single kernel which can run in either realtime or " normal " mode .
Is that still something that you 're working on ?
Thomas :
We are not working on that right now , but it is still on the list of things which need to be investigated . :
We are not working on that right now , but it is still on the list of things which need to be investigated .
Ingo :
That still sounds like an interesting feature , but it 's pretty hard to pull it off .
We used to have something rather close to that , a few years ago : a runtime switch that turned the rtmutex code back into spinning code .
It was fragile and hard to maintain and eventually we dropped it .
Ideally it should be done not at boot time but runtime - via the stop - machine - run mechanism or so .
[ extended perhaps with hibernation bits that force each task into hitting user - mode , so that all locks in the system are released ]
It 's really hard to implement it , and it is definitely not for the faint hearted .
The RT - preempt code would appear to be one of the biggest exceptions to the " upstream first " rule , which urges code to be merged into the mainline before being shipped to customers .
How has that worked out in this case ?
Are there times when it is good to keep shipping code out of the mainline for such a long time ?
Thomas :
It is an exception which was only acceptable because preempt -rt does not introduce new user space APIs .
It just changes the run time behaviour of the kernel to a deterministic mode . :
It is an exception which was only acceptable because preempt -rt does not introduce new user space APIs .
It just changes the run time behaviour of the kernel to a deterministic mode .
All changes which are user space API related ( e.g. PI futexes ) were merged into mainline before they got shipped to customers via preempt-rt and all bug fixes and improvements of mainline code were sent upstream immediately .
Preempt - rt was never a detached project which did not care about mainline .
When we started preempt -rt there was huge demand on the customer side - both enterprise and embedded - for an in kernel realtime solution .
The dual kernel approaches of RTAI , RT - Linux and Xenomai had no chance to get ever accepted into the mainline and the handling of the dual kernel environment has never been an easy task .
With preempt -rt you just switch the kernel under a stock mainline user space environment and voila your application behaves as you would expect - most of the time :)
Dual kernel environments require different libraries , different APIs and you can not run the same binary on a non -rt enabled kernel .
Debugging preempt -rt based real time applications is exactly the same as debugging non real time applications .

While we never had doubts that it would be possible to turn Linux into a real time OS , it was clear from the very beginning that it would be a long way until the last bits and pieces got merged .

While we never had doubts that it would be possible to turn Linux into a real time OS , it was clear from the very beginning that it would be a long way until the last bits and pieces got merged .
The first question Ingo asked me when I contacted him in the early days of preempt -rt was : " Are you sure that you want to touch every part of the kernel while working on preempt -rt ? " .
This question was absolutely legitimate ; in the first days of preempt -rt we really touched every part of the kernel due to problems which were mostly locking and preemption related .
The fixes have been merged upstream and especially in the locking area we got a huge improvement in mainline due to lock debugging , conversion to mutexes , etc. and a general better awareness of locking and preemption semantics .
preempt -rt was always a great breeding ground for fundamental changes in the kernel and so far quite a large part of the preempt -rt development has been integrated into the mainline : PI - futexes , high - resolution timers ...
I hope we can keep that up and provide soon more interesting technological changes which emerged originally from the preempt -rt efforts .
Ingo : Preempt - rt turns the kernel 's scheduling , lock handling and interrupt handling code upside down , so there was no realistic way to merge it all upstream without having had some actual field feedback .
It is also unique in that you need _all_ those changes to have the new kernel behavior - there 's no real gradual approach to the - rt concept itself .
That adds up to a bit of a catch - 22 : you do n't get it upstream without field use , and you do n't get field use without it being upstream .
Deterministic execution is a major niche , one of which was not effectively covered by the mainstream kernel before .
It 's perhaps the last major technological niches in existence that the stock upstream kernel does not handle yet , and it's no wonder that the last one out is in that precise position for conceptually hard reasons .
In short : all the easy technologies are upstream already ;-)
Nevertheless we strictly got all user - ABI changes upstream first : PI - futexes in particular .
The rest of - rt is " just " a new kernel option that magically turns kernel execution into deterministic mode .
Where would be the best starting point for a developer who wishes to contribute to this effort ?
Thomas : Nothing special with the realtime patches .
Just kernel development as usual : get the patches , apply them , run them on your machine and test .
If problems arise , provide bug reports or try to fix them yourself and send patches .
Read through the code and start providing improvements , cleanups ... : Nothing special with the realtime patches .

Ingo : Beyond the " try it yourself , follow the discussions , and go wherever your heart tells you to go " suggestion , there 's a few random areas that might need more attention : Big Kernel Lock removal .
It 's critical for - rt .
We still have the tip : core / kill - the - BKL branch , and if someone is interested it would be nice to drive that effort forward .
A lot of nice help - zap - the - BKL patches went upstream recently ( such as the device - open patches ) , so we are in a pretty good position to try the kill - the - BKL final hammer approach too .
[ I have just done a ( raw ! ) refresh and conflict resolution merge of that tree to v2.6.29 -rc5 .
Interested people can find it at : git pull \ git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/linux-2.6-tip.git

Warning : it might not even build . ]
Warning : it might not even build . ]
Look at Steve 's git -rt tree and split out and gradually merge bits .
A fair deal of stuff has been cleaned up there and it would be nice to preserve that work .
Latency measurements and tooling .
Go try the latency tracer , the function graph tracer and ftrace in general .
Try to find delays in apps caused by the kernel ( or caused by the app itself ) , and think about whether the kernel 's built - in tools could be improved .
Try Thomas 's cyclictest utility and try to trace and improve those worst - case latencies .
A nice target would be to push the worst - case latencies on a contemporary PC below 10 microseconds .
We were down to about 13 microseconds with a hack that threaded the timer IRQ with .29 - rt1 , so it 's possible to go below 10 microseconds i think .
And of course : just try to improve the mainline kernel - that will improve the - rt kernel too , by definition :-)
But as usual , follow your own path .
Independent , critical thinking is a lot more valuable than follow - the - crowd behavior .
[ As long as it ends up producing patches ( not flamewars ) that is ;-) ]
And by all means , start small and seek feedback on lkml early and often .
Being a good and useful kernel developer is not an attribute but a process , and good processes always need time , many gradual steps and a feedback loop to thrive .
Many thanks to Thomas and Ingo for taking the time to answer ( in detail ! ) this long list of questions .
So the weekend 's finally here , and it 's the big one we 've all been waiting for .
Hibernian v Hea ... hold on ... the CIS Cup final between Rangers and C... eh.. top v bottom in the Championship as Wolves take on Charlton Ath ... nope .
Italy v Wales in the Six Nations ?
Oh alright , it 's Manchester United v Liverpool .
But there 's a slight sense of anti-climax ; if only Liverpool had kept their gamefaces on since the turn of the year , we'd have the mother of all title races on our hands .
( Especially with that 18th title within United 's grasp ; finally a chance for Fergie to knock Liverpool off a perch , seeing it was George Graham who did it the last time . )
As it is , this is about little more than local bragging rights .
Yes , a first Liverpool win at Old Trafford since 2004 would close the gap at the top to four points ... but United have a game in hand , and we 're not Sky Sports , so come along , let 's face facts .
Kick off : 12.45 pm .
Dimitar Berbatov is dropped to the bench as Carlos Tevez steps in : Van der Sar , O'Shea , Ferdinand , Vidic , Evra , Ronaldo , Carrick , Anderson , Park , Rooney , Tevez .
Subs : Foster , Berbatov , Giggs , Nani , Scholes , Evans , Fletcher .
Xabi Alonso , shamefully ignored by Zinedine Zidane the other day , does n't recover from his knock against Real Madrid , so Lucas is called up : Reina , Arbeloa , Carragher , Skrtel , Aurelio , Mascherano , Lucas , Kuyt , Gerrard , Riera , Torres .
Subs : Cavalieri , Dossena , Hyypia , Babel , Insua , Ngog , El Zhar .
Referee : Alan Wiley ( Staffordshire )
The Premier League !
The best league in the wor ... ah .
" Seven points could become four , the title could be totally finished , and Purplenose and Goatee might land blows on one another 's hooters , " writes Alexander Netherton .
" But what I 'm really getting tumescent about is potential O'Shea - Dossena action . "
And I knew I should n't have mentioned the Old Firm .
" Where do you get off claiming the CIS Cup Final is not the game of the weekend ? " splutters chris macfarlane , who could n't be bothered to cap up his own name , so I 'm certainly not going to do it for him .
" It 's produced seven goals in three games so far this season ( Ok , the first game produced six of those but that 's neither here nor there . )
That 's 5.5 more than most top of the table EPL games in a whole season . "
You 've got to hand it to chris , he 's got a point , has n't He .
A last minute team change !
Sami Hyypia walks out with the Liverpool side .
Not sure what 's wrong with Alvaro Arbeloa , but he 's been injured in the warm - up and wo n't start .
Who 's going to play at right back is anyone 's guess .
Carragher , who does n't quite have the speed for full back , or Skrtel , who was a total disaster in the position at Middlesbrough ?
Maybe they should ask Gerrard , who spent a fruitful period playing there under Gerard Houllier , and was n't too shabby up against Serginho in the latter stages of the 2005 European Cup final .
Mascherano ?
And we 're off !
Carragher is going to play at right back , and he does n't look best pleased about it either .
Liverpool have a small victory , though , winning the toss and forcing United to play towards the Stretford End in the first half , not the second as they 'd prefer .
" Why do you write ( Staffordshire ) in brackets next to referee Alan Wiley 's name ? " asks Stuart Graham .
No idea .
" Is this his favourite breed of dog ? "
2 min : A strong start by Rooney down the left , who annoys Carragher a couple of times .
He wins a corner the first - nothing comes of it - then nearly skitters past him into the box , but can't quite make it .
A hectic start .
3 min : Tevez rolls a ball across the front of the Liverpool area from the right .
Park races in to sidefoot powerfully goalwards , but Carragher slides in to block .
Brilliant football all roung .
" I think Berbatov 's languid style suits being on the bench , " opines Ben Bamford , utilising his brain so I do n't have to .
" The sitting position allows him to fully express his Zen - like cant - be - arsed - to - move - around - very - much approach to the game . "
5 min : Liverpool can't hold onto the ball at all .
United run it at them .
Someone like Aurelio , Hyypia or Kuyt eventually breaks up the attack , then pings it long into space .
Van der
Sar picks the loose ball up .
And repeat .
6 min : Torres , chasing a long ball , is blocked off on the edge of the United box by Ferdinand .
He was never getting the ball , but it was a daft challenge - and could easily have been a free kick .
Wiley is n't interested , though .
That one could have gone either way , to be honest .
9 min : Liverpool have settled a bit now .
Lucas exchanges passes with Kuyt in the centre , steams down the park towards the United area , and only just fails to cilp a ball out left and set Gerrard free .
That was a decent , determined run from a player who has been getting a wee bit of stick from some sections of his own support lately .
11 min : Skrtel picks the ball up in his own half and starts running in a straight line - think the Tom Hanks film Darren Huckerby - towards the United box .
He 's allowed to reach the six - yard box , just to the left of goal , before he 's finally bustled off the ball by Vidic .
13 min : There 's a sense that Liverpool have indeed decided to go for this .
Gerrard nearly breaks clear down the inside - left channel , but is bundled out of it at the last by Vidic .
That looked dangerous for a split second .
And there are also signs they could leave gaps at the back : Evra breaks clear down the left and thrashes a hopeless shot high into the stands .
In the centre , a big black cloud develops over the free Wayne Rooney 's head , before being dispersed by blasts of words like EFF and CEE .
15 min : " I do n't think anyone has ever really dreamt of a team of Carraghers , " suggests Erik Kennedy .
No , I guess they probably have n't .
" I 'm not able to see this ' title - deciding clash ' on telly , but I 'd be grateful for occasional , descriptive updates on Jamie Carragher 's doings at right back . "
Your wish , etc , and so on .
He attempts to head an aimless Ferdinand hoof back towards Reina , but only manages to sky it out of play .
Two successive corners are the result , though nothing much comes of them .
19 min : Liverpool knock it around awhile in the United half .
Mascherano tries to knock the ball through Evra 's legs , so he can burst clear into the box , but it clanks off the defenders knees and away .
Kuyt snatches the loose ball back , though , and the away side start again .
21 min : Torres turns Ferdinand deliciously on the edge of the United box .
It 's a touch of genius - unlike his next one , which is heavy and allows O'Shea and Vidic to mop up between them .
For a second he was clear on goal there .
This is a decent period of play by Liverpool .
22 min : Gerrard floats a free kick into the United area from a fairly central position .
Skrtel is n't far off getting his head to it from eight yards out - but he does n't .
23 min : GOAL !
Manchester United 1 - 0 Liverpool .
Park chases a ball down the inside - left channel and into the box .
Reina races out rashly , and slides towards Park 's feet .
Park does what he has to do : run into the prone keeper and tumble over .
That 's such a soft penalty - the ball was flying out for a goal kick - but Reina gave Park the option .
Ronaldo smashes the spot kick into the left - hand side of Reina 's goal - and as they 've never lost when he 's scored at Old Trafford , that could be that for this season 's title .
28 min : GOAL !
Manchester United 1 - 1 Liverpool .
Liverpool looked shocked at that knockback , and did n't touch the ball for the best part of five minutes as United stroked it around .
And then Skrtel hoofs a long ball clear .
Vidic , running back to his own goal , allows the ball to bounce - and allows Torres to poke it away from him and tear clear on goal .
Van der
Sar comes out to close the angle , but Torres , running towards the right - hand side of the area , dinks it over the keeper and back into the left - hand corner .
That is hellish defending - and exquisite finishing .
Game on !
31 min : Torres troubles Vidic again twice , first forcing him to hack clear for a Liverpool corner , then heading an Aurelio cross over the United defender and chasing it into the United area himself .
Vidic blocks him off ; it 's not quite a penalty , but only not quite .
34 min : Lucas hacks Ronaldo down , 35 yards out to the left .
Ronaldo gets up and wallops a free kick straight at Reina - who fumbles , and only just manages to gather at the second attempt with Tevez racing in .
" Lay off Huckerby , " screams Matt Wallace .
" He 's the reigning MLS newcomer of the year , San Jose MVP , and arguably the greatest offside merchant to ever play in green and yellow , you joyless swine ! "
35 min : Carragher is booked for a crude and cynical trip on Tevez , who passes him down the left and races towards the box .
Ronaldo takes the free kick , just outside the area , on the left - hand corner .
The resulting free kick is terrible , rolled across for Rooney to have a swipe .
The ball 's cleared easily ; up the other end of the pitch a break looks on , but it 's halted as Ferdinand clips Kuyt .
That 's another yellow card .
38 min :
This is high - octane end - to - end stuff - although nothing much is going on in the penalty areas at the moment .
Nevertheless , I would be very surprised if this ends 1 - 1 , as both teams appear to have come out with a glory - or - death gameplan .
41 min : Torres so nearly frees Riera into the United box down the left , but Ferdinand steps in just at the right moment to sweep clear and set United trundling up the pitch .
After a minute or so's worth of pretty triangles down the right and back again , Carrick gets fed up , strides forward with the ball , and sends a screamer sailing just over the Liverpool bar .
That was inches over .
44 min : GOAL !!!
Manchester United 1 - 2 Liverpool .
Well , well , well .
Gerrard races after a pass down the inside - right channel and into the United box .
Evra comes across - and upends his man .
That 's the second penalty of the afternoon - and the second needless challenge .
Van der
Sar is booked for making Gerrard wait to take the spot kick - and his tactic does n't pay off , Gerrard stroking it into the bottom - right corner .
Wayne Rooney 's big black cloud is back : he 's got a thunderous face on , and the words EFF and CEE are falling out of it with great velocity and ferocity .
HALF TIME : Manchester United 1 - 2 Liverpool .
The half ends frantically .
From a Liverpool free kick , Gerrard has a slash at the ball ; his daisycutter is hacked clear by O'Shea .
Then Tevez zips up the pitch and wins a corner with a determined run down the right .
Nothing comes of that .
And then the whistle blows .
It 's been breathless and exciting , if short on actual chances in front of goal .
Like Liverpool will care .
The state of half - time banter today .
" Qaqqqqqra , " writes Ian Davies , the message being appended by : " Sent from my iPhone . "
You spend hundreds on an iPhone to send things like that ?
Still , I 'm not fussy .
And we 're off again !
Within eight seconds of the restart , United concede a corner , Liverpool pinging a long ball forward towards Evra , who heads wantonly behind .
It comes to nothing - allowing Rooney to scream down the right past Aurelio and oh - so - nearly sending Tevez clear in the centre .
Skrtel is across quickly to cover .
This promises to be quite the half of football .
48 min : Ronaldo skidaddles down the left and whips in a low cross .
Inexplicably , Reina allows the ball to clang off his near post !
He 's having a pretty shaky afternoon , is Reina .
He scrambles after the rebound , beating Tevez to the ball .
50 min : We 're told Berbatov is warming up .
Does this mean he 's got a fag on ?
52 min : Lucas upends Rooney 30 yards out , centrally .
Ronaldo sends the ball bouncing towards the bottom - right corner , but Reina has it covered .
And manages to catch it first time as well !
55 min : United are enjoying the lion 's share of the ball at the moment .
Ronaldo whips in a free kick from the right , causing no end of slapstick concern in the Liverpool box , but finally Hyppia hacks clear .
" Are you aware that the Edinburgh derby has had one goal and two red cards in the first half already ? " asks Michael Stewart ( not the one playing in the game , presumably ) .
" I 'm so glad I left Man Utd for this . "
Hmm .
Having said that ... does anybody know if you 're allowed to take a Blackberry onto the pitch in the SPL ?
57 min : Tevez chips across the face of goal from the left .
Reina is forced to backtrack and fingertip over the bar .
The corner 's swung in from the right , straight into the six - yard box , and Reina makes a three - course meal of grabbing the ball , Tevez lurking with intent .
59 min : United are prodding around the edges of the Liverpool danger zone , but not really creating very much .
Is Berbatov still smoking his cheroot ?
Maybe he 's lit another up .
Meanwhile Igor Calija has a prediction which , if it came to pass , would make everyone happy .
At various different points .
" Dossena to come in for Torres and score the winner in a 3 - 4 thriller .
Liverpool to draw 0 - 0 with Fulham two weeks from now . "
60 min : Mascherano picks up a booking for persistent niggly fouls .
Not sure why the ref felt the need to do that ; despite the speed and the passion , it 's not been a nasty game at all .
63 min : Ronaldo sweeps a cross into the Liverpool six - yard box from the right .
The ball bounces past the goal , then is guided straight back by the outside of Rooney 's boot .
Tevez can't get there in time to bundle home , and the chance goes , the ball slipping past the right - hand post .
64 min : Skrtel is booked for tapping the ankles of Tevez .
It 's fair enough , but on the other hand you could argue the ref's card need not have come out of his pocket once .
Sorry to labour the point , but this has been played in the right spirit so far , despite it all .
66 min : Gerrard launches a rare Liverpool sortie into the United half .
He sends Riera into space down the left .
The Spanish winger 's cross is headed out to the edge of the area , where Lucas awaits to volley a half - decent shot on target .
Van der Sar was always going to swallow that .
68 min : ATTENTION IGOR CALIJA !
ATTENTION IGOR CALIJA !
Hmm .
It 's £ 7 m Andrea Dossena !
He comes on for Riera .
71 min : What a chance for United .
Carrick dinks a ball straight down the centre of the park and into the Liverpool box .
Tevez is in space with his back to goal - slightly offside , but it 's not given - and he turns and guides a low effort wide left .
" I 've had a few pints , " boasts Kenyon Whitehead , " so ' Mascherano picks up a booking for persistent niggly fouls ' looked like ' Mascherano picks up a booking for persistent ugly looks ' . "
It did n't really , though , did it .
Unless you 've been enjoying pints of paint .
73 min : A triple substitution by Manchester United .
Anderson , Park and Carrick are replaced by Giggs , Scholes and Berbatov , who has finished his cigarette and is now ready to run about , a bit , sort of .
75 min : Ronaldo dinks a lovely ball forward to Tevez , who is this close of taking the ball down and guiding it past the advancing Reina .
But the ball flies away from him and towards safety for Liverpool .
76 min : RED CARD FOR VIDIC !
Just like before the Torres goal , Vidic is diddled , the ball being knocked past him by Gerrard , who 's running into space .
Vidic drags him back - and he 's off .
That was a no brainer for the referee .
78 min : GOAL !!!
Manchester United 1 - 3 Liverpool .
The free kick is just right of centre , 25 yards out .
Aurelio steps up and curls the ball into the top - right corner , with Van der Sar standing rooted to the spot .
That was an excellent free kick .
" Rafa 's cracking up , " is bellowed by the delighted denizens of the away end .
Still , the niggling thought remains : if only they 'd kept their gamefaces on during January and February ...
81 min : Babel comes on for Torres , who has been wholly excellent , though quieter during this second half .
" Alex Ferguson 's face seems to have entered a new spectrum beyond red after that goal and red card , " suggests Nic English .
Can anyone from Pantone confirm this ?
84 min : Giggs swings a ball in from the left .
It 's heading wide right .
Everyone gives up on it - except Rooney , who swings a boot at it and guides it back into the centre .
Reina finally wakes up and comes out to claim .
Berbatov nearly gets there , but he was standing in the centre on the spot for far too long , dreaming of 20 cigarettes walking around ... burning ... lovely fags ...
86 min : Dossena swings a ball in from the left towards Babel .
Ferdinand misses his header , and Babel gains possession eight yards out .
He 's facing away from goal , so he clips a backheel out right to Gerrard , who 's staring straight at Van der Sar !
It should be four ... but it is n't , Gerrard 's first - time sidefoot finding the top - right corner of the Stretford End .
87 min : A deep cross from the United right finds Ronaldo free , six yards out , just to the left of goal .
He should at least make Reina work ... but swishes at fresh air .
That pretty much sums United 's day up .
90 min :
The ten men of United are finishing the stronger , Liverpool quite happy to sit back and soak up the pressure .
Rooney has a swipe from 25 yards , but it 's wide and well over the bar .
Gerrard is replaced by El Zhar .
There will be four more minutes of this .
" Ferguson 's face would be below red , not beyond it , like infrared , " explains Martijn Scheffer .
" He could be used to keep burgers warm at McDonalds . "
90 min +1 : THIS IS AMAZING !!!
Manchester United 1 - 4 Liverpool .
Reina kicks the ball long .
Ferdinand misjudges it , Vidic - style .
He 's outpaced by Dossena !
Who lobs Van der Sar !!
And sends the ball bouncing into the empty net !!!
That is a simply outstanding finish .
Ferguson 's face will be burning those burgers .
FULL TIME : Manchester United 1 - 4 Liverpool .
The away end segues from Rafa 's Cracking Up into You 'll Never Walk Alone .
El Zhar skids down the right and sends a low cross into the area .
Ferdinand nearly sidefoots into the top - right corner .
United have been a shambles today .
And that 's it : the referee blows his whistle .
" Obviously £ 7 m Andrea Dossena has been playing out of position all along , " suggests Chris McGee .
" Play him as a winger and it's all good ! "
That 's the biggest away win at Old Trafford since QPR's Dennis Bailey scored three on New Year 's Day 1992 .
" Mere infrared cannot express enough rage at that unlikely turn of events , " writes James Wells .
" Fergie 's face is emitting radio waves at this point . "
Every silver lining has a cloud for some Liverpool fans : " This just makes all the thrown - away results at bottom of the league clubs even more frustrating , " writes Nick Potter .
But does it ?
Four goals at Old Trafford ?
Does it really ?
Understanding the “ Smart Grid ”
With all of the talk about renewable energy becoming “ mainstream ” as opposed to “ alternative ” over the course of the Obama years , the United States is rapidly growing its smart grid strategy and infrastructure to efficiently deliver electricity .
Though a major cause for excitement among greenies for some time , many consumers do not yet understand either the terminology or the technology behind this endeavor .
What is a Smart Grid ?
A smart grid is an electricity grid that uses digital technology to deliver electricity from suppliers to consumers .
This process helps to save energy , reduce costs and increase reliability .
The U.S. government is extremely focused on building smart grid technology in order to encourage energy independence and address global warming .
Here is how the U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ) defines smart grid :
“ The electric grid delivers electricity from points of generation to consumers , and the electricity delivery network functions via two primary systems : the transmission system and the distribution system .
The transmission system delivers electricity from power plants to distribution substations , while the distribution system delivers electricity from distribution substations to consumers .
The grid also encompasses myriads of local area networks that use distributed energy resources to serve local loads and / or to meet specific application requirements for remote power , village or district power , premium power , and critical loads protection . ”
Building a smart grid is expected to have many benefits , ranging from a huge slash in carbon emissions to providing consumers an opportunity to put electricity back into the grid and receive compensation for their power - generation efforts .
Smart Grid Technology Research & Development
Developing a smart grid for the U.S. is a complicated task that combines policy , planning , and implementation .
On one hand , the grid needs to be able to connect various devices yet operate smoothly .
On the other hand , because of growing environmental concerns , the grid needs to accommodate power generation from renewable sources and incorporate energy - efficiency techniques .
Our current grid was built over 50 years ago ; to prevent blackouts and ensure electricity for a growing America , it needs to be updated .
Because this will essentially require an overhaul of each state ’s utility infrastructure , building a smart grid has implications for the architectural and technological framework for energy distribution .
The DOE ’s Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability has invested significant resources in research and development of technology which fall under four key areas that will directly contribute to achieving the performance features of a smart grid :
Architecture & Communication Standards : Architectural framework and components to enable interoperability of all components and systems in the nation ’s power grid including existing legacy systems Monitoring & Load Management Technologies :
Fault detection , localization , prediction and power quality monitoring with integration of communication , analysis , and control techniques ; Monitoring and control of industrial / commercial / residential loads for demand - side management Advanced Components & Operating Concepts : Interconnection technologies , substation and equipment advancements , advanced system operating concepts ( intentional islanding , micro-grids , etc. )
Modeling & Simulation : Planning and operational support for contingencies and disturbance events , including integration with disparate databases , reconfiguration , restoration , and optimization of grid performance .
Which are the leading Smart Grid states ?
Now that over $ 4 billion in stimulus money is available for Smart Grid improvements and innovations , many states are taking strides to develop their smart grid technology .
Some states have made more improvement than others .
California appears to top the list when it comes to smart grid technology .
Policy makers here are deeply committed to the cause of renewable energy and have supported the state ’s three big utilities — SCE , SDGE , and PG&E — in developing best practice frameworks to guide the rest of the country .
The three utilities are also rolling out smart meters to all of their customers .
Of course , it does n’t hurt that California governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , has vowed to get more stimulus money than any other state in the nation !
Texas comes in right behind California , with three of its utilities — CenterPoint Energy , Oncor , and Austin Energy — already rolling out smart meter .
Other states that have made significant advances are Florida , Pennsylvania , Ohio , West Virginia and Illinois .
But although , these particular states stand out right now , others are also showing signs of coming up to speed on smart grid technology .
Given that the world is moving to an Electricity Economy , modernizing the grid is one of the smartest things we can do to remain globally competitive .
This video brings together a team of experts to explain what the smart grid is , how it works and how it can have significant benefits for Americans .

At the start of the fourth quarter , analysts were expecting S&P 500 earnings to grow by 30 % versus Q4 ' 07 .
While this seems outlandish now , remember that growth in Q4 '07 was extremely poor as well , and analysts thought many companies would begin to turn the corner by Q4 ' 08 .
As we all know , the economy pretty much came to a halt last October .
As a result , analysts quickly began to cut growth estimates for the fourth quarter after it became apparent that things were n't going to get better anytime soon .
Fast forward a few months , and now analysts are expecting those same Q4 '08 earnings to be 28 % weaker than the fourth quarter of 2007 .
With the direction that these estimates have been heading , when all is said and done , it 's likely that this number will get even worse .

We are pleased to announce the creation of a new resource : the REAL Democracy History Calendar .
You are invited to sign up to this new free weekly email resource – to be sent out beginning January 1 , 2016 .
To sign up , click here .
Corporate entities and individuals of extreme wealth have to a major extent captured our government and economic institutions .
Basic political , economic and human rights are in decline .
The result is a lack of real democracy — defined as the ability of those who are affected by decisions having an authentic voice in the shaping of those decisions .
However , people have always strived for basic rights , resisted oppression , created alternative structures , and sought to control the power and influence of corporate entities and extreme wealth in society through education , advocacy and social movement organizing .
To sign up , click here .
The REAL Democracy History Calendar will provide 1 - 2 listings per day sent by email every Monday morning of activities , events , quotes from prominent individuals and / or other occurrences ( both past and recent ) on the themes of democracy , human rights , corporate power and rule , and wealth in society ( especially in elections ) .
The Calendar is a joint production of the Program on Corporations , Law & Democracy ( POCLAD ) and the former Northeast Ohio American Friends Service Committee ( AFSC ) .
Much of its base comes from our research and writings on these themes over the last two decades .
Our goal is to inform , intrigue and inspire — and to illuminate the reality that creating real democracy will not happen by changing any one politician , passing / repealing any one law or regulation , or reversing any single Supreme Court decision .
It requires , rather , changing our political , economic and social culture - one byproduct of which will be to democratize our legal structures through genuinely inclusive , multi-issue , nonviolent social movements .

1799 – Death of George Washington , first President of the United States of America – need for coercive power
“ We probably had too good an opinion of human nature in forming our confederation .
Experience has taught us that men will not adopt and carry into execution measures the best calculated for their own good , without the intervention of a coercive power , ” said George .
According to historian Charles Beard in “ An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States , ” Washington was probably the richest man in the colonies at the time of the Revolution .
1896 – Covington & L. Turnpike Road Co. v. Sandford ( 164 U.S. 578 ) Supreme Court decision – corporations are persons
The Court declared , “ it is now settled that corporations are persons , within the meaning of the constitutional provisions forbidding the deprivation of property without due process of law , as well as a denial of the equal protection of the laws . ”
December 15
1791 – Ratification of the Bill of Rights
The first 10 Amendments to the Constitution were adopted to protect We the People from excesses of government and to affirm certain inalienable rights of human beings .
At the time , however , We the People were only white males who owned property and were over 21 years old .
Each state decided how much property must be owned to qualify to vote or run for office
1986 – Justice William Brennan delivered opinion of Supreme Court in Federal Election Committee v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life , Inc. ( 479 U.S. 238 ) – spending by corporations in elections may make them formidable power
“ Direct corporate spending on political activity raised the prospect that resources amassed in the economic marketplace may be used to provide an unfair advantage in the political marketplace …
The resources in the treasury of a business corporation …are not an indication of popular support for the corporation 's political ideas .
The availability of these resources may make a corporation a formidable political presence , even though the power of the corporation may be no reflection of the power of its ideas . "
December 16
1773 – Colonists stage Boston Tea Party to protest British Tea Act
Parliament passed the Tea Act , which provided the East India Trading Company complete access to the colonies and exempted it from paying taxes to the colonies – increasing the profits to company stockholders , which included Parliament members and the King .
This undercut colonial tea merchants who were required to pay taxes on tea .
Boston Tea Party participants saw themselves as anti-corporate protestors .
Their call for “ no taxation without representation ” was not one against paying taxes , but rather an insistence that every entity – including the East India Company – should pay their fair share and that no entity should be taxed without governmental representation .
December 17
1964 – Death of Alexander Meiklejohn , Philosopher and Educator – on 1st Amendment and freedom threatened by dominant business enterprises
The 1st Amendment " does not intend to guarantee men freedom to say what some private interest pays them to say for its own advantage .
It intends only to make men free to say what , as citizens , they think . ”
“ [ I ] nsofar as a society is dominated by the attitudes of competitive business enterprise , freedom in its proper American meaning cannot be known , and hence , can not be taught .
That is the basic reason why the schools and colleges , which are , presumably , commissioned to study and promote the ways of freedom are so weak , so confused , so ineffectual . ”
December 18
1882 – Death of Henry James , Sr. – on democracy
" Democracy is not so much a new form of political life as a dissolution and disorganization of the old forms .
It is simply a resolution of government into the hands of the people … ”
December 19
2009 – Publication this month of article , “ People as Property : Criminalizing Color , Dissent and Impoverishment through the Prison - Industrial Complex ” by Karen Coulter , principal of the Program on Corporations , Law & Democracy ( POCLAD )
“ Slavery and involuntary servitude were supposedly abolished by the 13th amendment to the Constitution .
However , the amendment reads that slavery and involuntary servitude shall no longer exist in the U.S. ‘ except as punishment for crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted ’… Then there are the investors in the prison industry : American Express Corporation invested millions in private prison construction in Oklahoma ; General Electric Corporation financed prison construction in Tennessee ; Goldman Sachs , Merrill Lynch , Smith Barney , and other Wall Street investment firms made big profits by underwriting prison construction with the sale of tax - exempt bonds , a 2.3 billion dollar industry as of 1997 .
Some of the largest Wall Street investment corporations started buying bonds and securities from private prison corporations in the ' 90's and reselling them for profit to individual investors , mutual funds and others , literally speculating in the growth of locking up more and more people .
The rise of the prison industrial complex can be accurately seen as part of a profound transformation restructuring U.S. economic development and its forms of social control .
Philip
Wood identifies corporate colonization of decision - making structures as a key element of the changes in U.S. public policy supporting the expansion and privatization of the prison industry . ”

1885 – Corporate lawyers claim railroad corporation ’s 14th Amendment rights violated
In San Mateo v. Southern Pacific R. Co. , 13 F. 722 ( C.C.D. Cal. 1882 ) , corporate lawyers attacked a provision of the California Constitution that assessed higher property taxes against railroad corporations than against non-corporate properties .
The attorneys charged that the state violated the railroad ’s “ rights ” under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment .
The parties settled the case before the Supreme Court announced a decision ; however , the argument would be used one year later in what would become the very first time corporations were granted 14th Amendment “ rights ” by the Supreme Court in Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company , 118 US 394 .

1913 – Congress passes Federal Reserve Act – Creating Federal Reserve System
The Act created a largely corporate controlled national banking and currency system , passed in the House by 298-60 and in the Senate by 43 - 25 and signed by President Wilson on this day .
It was a major coup for banking corporations through the establishment of a private central bank authorized to " monetize " government debt ( i.e. to print their own money and exchange it for government securities or I.O.U.'s ) .
The central banking system was composed of 12 regional private / corporate banks owned by participating commercial banks .
All national banks were required to join the system .
Banking corporations now controlled the issuance and distribution of our national currency .
By controlling our national money faucet , they could create inflation and deflation .
This corporate monopolization of our currency allowed for public regulation , but not control .
It was now banking corporations , not the U.S. government , that controlled the national currency .
Congress handed its Constitutional power under Article 1 , Section 8 to create our money over to private banking corporations .
It ’s the ultimate form of “ privatization ” – more accurately “ corporatization ” – of what was meant to be , and should be a public function or service .
December 24
1962 – Birth of David Cobb , national Outreach Director for Move to Amend and principal of the Program on Corporations , Law & Democracy ( POCLAD )
Cobb debated James Bopp in September , 2014 at Indiana University in Bloomington , IN on “ Citizens Divided : Corporate Money , Speech , and Politics . ”
Bopp is General Counsel for the James Madison Center for Free Speech and was lead attorney for Citizens United , the group that argued their corporate 1st Amendment “ speech rights were violated when prevented to air a political program just prior to the election . ”
The “ debate ” turned out to be one - sided – with Cobb presenting a much stronger case for why corporations should not be granted “ personhood ” rights and money should not be granting “ free speech ” rights than Bopp arguing the reverse .

2015 – Christmas – Jesus attacks “ money changers ”
Celebrated birth of Jesus Christ in Christian calendar .
In his only public act of violence , Jesus drove the “ money changers ” with a whip of chords out of the sacred Temple in Jerusalem , which he called “ my Father ’s house . ”
Modern - day money changers are banking corporations – the most economically and politically dominant of all corporations .
They have captured our most sacred democratic “ house ” – our government .
They , too , along with all other corporations , need to be driven out of our government .
December 26
2015 – Boxing Day - corporate personhood , money equals free speech and U.S. Constitution “ boxes ” activists into small spaces of what is doable
“ Boxing Day ” is an annual holiday celebrated in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth nations .
Traditionally , it was when servants or employees would receive gifts from their bosses or employers in “ Christmas boxes . ”
Many Supreme Court decisions anointing corporations as legal “ persons ” and money as “ free speech , ” as well as many limitations of the U.S. Constitution ( i.e. no direct election of President , no national initiative provision , no definition of economic rights , among many others ) have been anything but gifts to individuals striving for real democracy .
They have , rather , “ boxed ” activists into ever - smaller spaces concerning what laws and regulations can be passed .
Unable to limit the amount of money in elections from individuals and corporate entities and incapable of preventing corporations from asserting Bill of Rights protections , the super wealthy and corporate entities have captured greater portions of public policies and public spaces and , in turn , shrinking these public arenas for the vast majority of citizens .
For background on limitations of and possibilities for a more democratic Constitution , see http://poclad.org/BWA/2007/BWA_2007_DEC.html and http://poclad.org/BWA/2007/BWA_2007_MAR.html#3

1907 – Death of John Chandler Bancroft Davis – unilateral action yielded first Supreme Court corporate “ personhood ” decision
Davis played a historical role in the corporate personhood debate .
As the court reporter in Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad ( 118 U.S. 394 , 1886 ) , his responsibility was to prepare ‘ a summary - of - the - case commentary . ’
He wrote in the headnote to the decision that Chief Justice Morrison Waite began his oral argument of the court ’s opinion by stating , ‘ The court does not wish to hear argument on the question whether the provision in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution , which forbids a State to deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws , applies to these corporations .
We are all of the opinion that it does . ”
Davis ’ published reports and notes from 1885 - 1886 contained his views on the Santa Clara case : ‘ The defendant Corporations are persons within the intent of the clause in section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States , which forbids a State to deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . ”
Thom Hartman and other journalists and authors charged Davis with a conflict of interest as previous President of the Newburgh and New York Railway in his role in the Supreme Court ruling .

‘ When 100 big donors give as much almost 5 million small donors , with whom do we expect candidates to spend their time , and whose interests do we think they will represent ? ’
McKinnen asked .
‘ That ’s not democracy .
That ’s oligarchy . ’ ”

1945 – Birth of Harvey Wasserman – exposes fraudulent electronic voting machines
Wasserman is an anti-nuclear and safe energy activist , journalist and senior editor of the Columbus Free Press .
He has co-authored numerous articles with Bob Fitrakis on election fraud of elections since 2000 , with special emphasis on the 2000 and 2004 election results in Ohio .
Wasserman and Fritakis have recently written .
“ The way our electoral process now stands , electronic voting machines guarantee a Republican victory in 2016 …
“ Source codes remain " proprietary , " so the public has no control over the private machines on which our allegedly democratic elections are conducted .
There is no usable paper trail , transparency or accountability .
“ We are concerned that all voters get fair access to the polls , and all votes are fairly counted , no matter who the candidate .
We have no doubt the Democratic Party would be just as willing to flip elections from Republicans as vice versa , and that both have , can and will do the same to the Green Party and other challengers .
“ So we support universal hand - counted paper ballots , automatic universal voter registration , a four - day national holiday for voting , major restrictions on campaign spending and a wide range of additional reforms meant to guarantee some kind of democracy in the United States . ”

The approach hinges on a method of putting more colours into a laser pulse
A new method of examining the inner workings of plants has shed light on how they harvest the Sun 's energy .
Researchers have taken laser snapshots lasting just one ten - thousandth of a billionth of a second to examine the role of electrons in energy transfer .
The approach will be key in discovering how energy trickles through other systems , such as electronic devices , and could lead to better solar cells .
The work is published in the current issue of Physical Review Letters .
Ian Mercer of University College Dublin , Ireland , collaborating with researchers at Imperial College London , UK , examined the protein LH2 , a well - known photosynthetic system .
The protein harvests light , helping along the molecular machinery that pulls electrons out of water , in turn driving the reaction that makes sugars from carbon dioxide .
" More generally , we 're trying to understand how nature can transport energy across large molecules , and photosynthesis is a good example of where nature does it remarkably efficiently , " Dr Mercer told BBC News .
Significant research has been performed to assess the role of electrons in that process with a view to increasing the performance of solar cells , most of which currently operate at an efficiency around just 10 % .
Colour full
What has remained unclear , though , is the way in which electrons interact with each other or with the molecules of the machinery .
It 's a whole new world of what you can look at
Ian Mercer
University College Dublin
A number of laser - based methods have been developed to examine that electron coupling , but they require that the delicate proteins are subject to thousands or millions of laser pulses , which can change their structure or destroy them altogether .
Dr Mercer 's method can look at those electron couplings directly with just one " ultrafast " laser pulse lasting 100 femtoseconds - or ten thousand million times shorter than an average camera flash .
Such short pulses are made up of a broad spectrum of colours , with each colour corresponding to the particular energy of the photons that make it .
The new method works by splitting powerful laser pulses into three beams and crossing them in the protein samples in a specific geometry .
The light that comes out gives for the first time an unambiguous picture of how the different colours - and thus energies - interact inside the protein .
" The fact that it 's instantaneous is not just a detail , not just a nicety , " Dr Mercer said .
" It means we 're able to take a picture of any system before that molecule has had a chance for its atoms to move significantly .
" We 're looking at the shape of something before the laser was even there - it's a whole new world of what you can look at . "
Wide application
The data sheds light on how electrons move in chloroplasts
The new method is applicable across a wide array of samples ; the intricate details of electron and energy transport are the subject of study in disciplines ranging from electronics to drug design .
The results could be used to help mimic the photosynthesis process in the design of more efficient solar cells - a pursuit in which Dr Mercer says " the impact of a small increase in efficiency is very large for the world " .
The method was only made possible by developments at Imperial College London in lasers that can provide the huge range of colours in the laser pulses , a pursuit headed up by John Tisch and Jon Marangos .
The technology was subsequently used at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory 's Astra laser .
" The laser source has opened up a new frontier of optics , " Dr Tisch said .
" The beauty of it is that you really can extract the information in a single shot - the data was coming out of this much faster than it could be viewed . "
Dr Mercer said that the team is now in discussion with a number of researchers who are keen to apply the method in their own work .
" There is n't a conversation I 've had that has n't resulted in someone saying , ' well , let 's get a sample in there ' . "

Two military contractors , General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman , agreed on Wednesday to a Pentagon deal that will clear the way for all three of the Navy ’s multibillion - dollar stealth destroyers to be built at General Dynamics ’ shipyard in Maine , Pentagon and industry officials said .
Northrop Grumman , which had expected to build one of the DDG - 1000 destroyers at its shipyard in Mississippi , will contribute major components for each of the vessels .
It will also receive contracts for two other destroyers as the Navy restarts production of an earlier model .
Stock analysts said the deal , pushed by Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates , appeared to be a winning proposition for both contractors .
“ Mr. Gates delivered a gift to the shipbuilders , ” said Loren B. Thompson , a military consultant and the chief operating officer of the Lexington Institute , a research group .
Advocates for intellectual property reform are sounding skittish about the emerging upper echelon of Barack Obama 's Justice Department , which is shaping up as a who 's - who of star litigators for the music , movie , and software industries .
The most recent addition to a long roster , prospective Associate Deputy Attorney General Donald Verrilli , is a veteran of several of the highest - profile IP cases seen in recent years , on the side of stronger and more aggressive copyright protection in each case .
Verrili represented Viacom in its billion - dollar suit against YouTube , which sought to compel the video streaming site to more aggressively police user - submitted content for copyright infringement , articulating a legal theory that YouTube 's lawyers say would vitiate service providers ' " safe harbor " immunity against liability for user conduct .
He filed an amicus brief on behalf of copyright owners in the Cablevision remote DVR case , arguing that the cable company 's recording and streaming service was less a long - distance TiVo than a high - end Pirate Bay .
When the Recording Industry Association of America sought to block a retrial in the Jammie Thomas file - sharing case — preventing any reconsideration of the theory that " making available " a file is tantamount to infringing distribution — they called Verrilli .
And in the landmark Grokster case , which held the makers of the peer - to - peer client responsible for facilitating infringement , Verrilli 's name crops up again .
Verrilli caps a string of picks that have made free culture types squirm ; his colleague at Jenner & Block , Thomas Perrelli , has been tapped for the number - three spot at Justice .
Beloved by the RIAA , Perrelli too has argued on the industry 's behalf in several cases against accused file - sharers .
He also helped persuade the Copyright Royalty Board to jack up the rates paid by webcasters — and collected by the RIAA on behalf of members and nonmembers alike .
In line for the position of associate deputy attorney general is Neil MacBride , a former lawyer to Vice President Joe Biden last seen acting as general counsel for the Business Software Alliance .
And the country 's number - two lawyer will be David Ogden , who was part of the government team defending retroactive copyright extension in Eldred v. Ashcroft and orchestrated the defense of the now - defunct Child Online Protection Act .
Some lists of " industry " lawyers bound for justice have have included David Kris , who recently spent several years at Time Warner and will soon head the DoJ 's National Security Division .
Is there really cause for concern ?
So how much cause for genuine concern is there ?
Worries about Ogden and Kris , at the very least , border on the ludicrous .
Though all of the appointees would be expected to recuse themselves from involvement in cases or decisions implicating former clients , Kris is an expert on surveillance and intelligence law who would rarely have occasion to influence IP issues in any event .
Ogden , meanwhile , would simply have been tasked with defending the government 's position in whatever cases he was assigned .
Tellingly , he has also been attacked by the socially conservative group Fidelis for his work on behalf of gay rights and free speech .
To be sure , his defense of Playboy and Penthouse , like his defense of COPA , should be viewed above all as an attorney 's faithful representation of his client 's interests , but the former , at least , were cases voluntarily undertaken in private practice .
For the same reason — and because it 's psychologically difficult to consistently defend the same position without at least somewhat internalizing it — concerns about Verrilli , MacBride , and Perrelli may be marginally more justifiable .
Still , the obligation of recusal makes them unlikely to have a prominent role in such IP litigation as the Justice Department sees fit to intervene in .
Moreover , the Justice Department already successfully fought off an attempt to deputize government lawyers as copyright cops .
If there 's a genuine worry about someone like Perrelli , it 's not that he'd turn the power of the state on Kazaa users , but that he might not be inclined to complain as loudly the next time such a proposal is mooted .
That said , the angst over the recent picks seems , above all , like an instance of what social psychologists call the " fundamental attribution error " :
The tendency to weight intrinsic character or disposition too heavily , and social circumstances too lightly , when explaining observed behavior .
We know , for instance , that when test subjects are asked to guess the opinion of an essay 's author , they will assume that the author agrees with his essay even if they are told the author was instructed to defend that position .
Perhaps these appointees took the cases they did because of a deep commitment to an expansive view of copyright .
But is n't it more parsimonious to observe that the RIAA pays well ?
Update : Gigi Sohn of Public Knowledge basically agrees with the notion that one should n't read too much into arguments lawyers make in defense of their clients , but also suggests that future appointments strive for " balance " :

Advertisement Police are using hundreds of paid informants inside protest groups to " feed them intelligence " , according to evidence handed to the Guardian .
The paper says it has obtained tapes of discussions between men claiming to be undercover officers from Strathclyde Police and a Plane Stupid activist .
The recordings appear to show money being offered for information .
Strathclyde Police said officers had spoken to the group and the force had a responsibility to gather evidence .
The Guardian says the recordings were made during meetings between Strathclyde Police and Matilda Gifford , an activist with environmental protest group Plane Stupid , which campaigns against airport expansion .
The taped evidence appears to show her being offered money to reveal information about the organisation 's members and tactics .
' Respecting rights '
An indication was given that tens of thousands of pounds had been paid to other informers in the past .
Miss Gifford 's student loans were also discussed .

In the three hours of recordings , the unnamed men also claimed to have a network of hundreds of informants inside protest organisations across the political spectrum .
The Assistant Chief Constable of Strathclyde Police , George Hamilton , told the Guardian the force had " a responsibility to gather intelligence " .
" Officers from Strathclyde Police have been in contact with a number of protesters who were involved with the Plane Stupid protests including Aberdeen airport , " he said .
" The purpose of this contact has been to ensure that any future protest activity is carried out within the law and in a manner which respects the rights of all concerned . "
' Business proposal '
But Miss Gifford said police were trying to disrupt the legitimate activity of environmental groups .
She told the BBC that while payment was discussed , definite sums of money were never finalised .
" They never said an actual amount to me , " she said .
" They wanted to discuss a business proposal in our next meeting , is what they said , so we never actually put a figure on it .
" They hinted it would be useful in terms of student loans . "
Miss Gifford also said that Plane Stupid 's lawyers had attempted to identify the officers involved , but without success .
Former Flying Squad chief John O'Connor described the matter as a " storm in a teacup " and that similar contacts are often made with individuals in protest groups and in the criminal world .
He told the BBC : " That 's what the police do .
The police do n't sit in their ivory towers , and expect the phone to ring and be given intelligence information .
" They go out actively to try and gather it . "

A gadget blog has posted a rumor that Apple plans to deny SlingPlayer — a popular TV - streaming service — from appearing as an app in the App Store .
Why ?
To please AT&T , according to the unnamed source .
Electronista cites " a source close to Apple 's approval processes , " who claims Apple is giving SlingPlayer the red light because AT&T fears it will strain bandwidth on its network .
SlingMedia , which submitted the iPhone app in late March , could not confirm the rumor .
" I know there 's a lot of rumors swirling around , but we talk to Apple pretty frequently about all sorts of stuff , and we have n't heard anything one way or the other as to acceptance of SlingPlayer for iPhone , " SlingMedia spokesman Jay Tannenbaum told Wired.com .
AT&T and Apple declined to comment .
If the story turns out to be true , it would not be the first time Apple rejected an application to appease AT&T .
In August , Apple clumsily approved and then banned an application called NetShare , which enabled tethering with the iPhone .
NetShare developer Nullriver told Wired.com that Apple pulled the app because it conflicted with AT&T 's terms and conditions .
Though the App Store has its share of success stories for developers , Apple has been scrutinized for being unclear with developers about its iPhone - app approval process .
FreedomVoice Systems , for example , submitted its iPhone application Newber in October — and still has n't heard an answer from Apple .
As a result , FreedomVoice tabled further development , complaining that this lack of communication could cost the company $ 600,000 in funding spent on Newber .
The rumor about SlingPlayer Mobile and AT&T is questionable , but believable .
You can certainly imagine why AT&T would feel worried about bandwidth on its already strained network .
PCMag 's Jamie Lendino wrote a hands - on report on an alpha version of the app , and she noted the app played streams " with reasonable smoothness over a weak 3 - G signal and near 30 fps animation over Wi-Fi . "
However , Wired.com thinks SlingPlayer will appear in the App Store for a few reasons .
First ,
Sling is a very high - profile , popular service whose plans for an iPhone app have been well - documented ; a flat rejection would cause an uproar .
Second , Sling tells Wired.com it has a good , communicative relationship with Apple , and we trust Apple will not break that relationship .
Third , Apple already announced it 's optimizing live streaming in the upcoming iPhone 3.0 OS — a Major League Baseball app using this improved streaming support is already in the works , although it remains unconfirmed whether this will only work with Wi -Fi .
Therefore , if Apple does reject SlingPlayer , we believe Apple will give Sling instructions on modifications it would like to see — most likely Apple would ask Sling to make its app work only with Wi-Fi and to disable the cellular network support .
What do you think ?
Would you care if Sling only worked over Wi-Fi ?
Add your thoughts in the comments section below .

Indian money stashed in the Swiss Bank has become a focal point of debate , especially after the Leader of Opposition and the Bharatiya Janata Party 's prime ministerial candidate L K Advani raised the issue on Sunday .
If elected , the BJP has vowed to bring the black money back home .
Though the Congress dismissed the idea , the Swiss bank issue is slowly becoming a hot election issue .
In fact the BJP also plans to carry out a mock election across the country on April 6 where people will have to cast their vote indicating whether Indian money in Swiss banks should be brought back to India or not .
During his address , Advani said the BJP will form a task force comprising experts to prepare a strategic document for India to recommend ways to get back the national wealth stashed away illegally by corrupt politicians , businessmen and criminal overlords .
One of the names he mentioned in the task force is Professor R Vaidyanathan , Professor of Finance at the Indian Institute of Management , Bengaluru .
In this exclusive interview to rediff.com 's Vicky Nanjappa , Vaidyanathan explains in detail the importance of bringing back the ill - gotten wealth and how the money got there in the first place .
Firstly how much Indian money do you think is stashed away in the Swiss Banks ?
In 2006 , the most recent Global Financial Integrity study , developing countries lost an estimated $ 858.6 billion ( about Rs 43 lakh crore ) to $ 1.06 trillion ( abot Rs 51 lakh crore ) in illicit financial outflows .
Even at the lower end of the range of estimates , the volume of illicit financial flows coming out of developing countries increased at a compound rate of 18.2 percent over the five - year period analysed for the study .
On average , for the five - year period of this study , Asia accounts for approximately 50 percent of overall illicit financial flows from all developing countries .
This report shows that the average amount stashed away from India annually during 2002 - 06 is $ 27.3 billion ( about 136,466 crore ) .
It means that during the five - year period the amount stashed away is 27.3x5=136.5 billion ( about 692,328 crore ) .
It is not that all these amounts went to Swiss banks .
It has gone to different tax and secret shelters .
The share of Swiss banks in dirty money being a third of the global aggregate , some $ 45 billion out of the 136.5 billion stashed away from India would have been hoarded in these years in Swiss banks .
The important point is that this is only for five years .
More amounts were stashed away during the Nehruvian regime .
So the loot for 55 years will be several times higher .
In fact , in those days the rupee commanded a better value per dollar .
So fewer rupee could get more dollars .
So the estimation that the Indian money stashed away may be of the order of $ 1.4 trillion ( about Rs 71 lakh crore ) .
On what basis have you come to this conclusion ?
There is a lot of literature available as to how to estimate the illicit financial flow from developing countries .
We find out what the nature of the flow is .
I have also relied upon the study Illicit Financial Flows from Developing Countries : 2002 - 2006 Global Finanacial Intergrity authored by Dev Kar and Devon - Cartwright Smith , a project of the Ford Foundation .
Financial flows in the context of this report includes the proceeds from both illicit activities such as corruption ( bribery and embezzlement of national wealth ) , criminal activity , and the proceeds of ilicit business that become illicit when transported across borders in contravention of applicable laws and regulatory frameworks ( most commonly in order to evade taxes ) .
Which are the various tax havens , where the ill - gotten wealth of Indian businessmen and politicians are stashed ?
There are presumably more than 70 tax havens in the world .
Indian wealth could be more in Switzerland and various British / US islands .
At least 40 countries market themselves aggressively as tax havens [ Source : Internal Revenue Service USA on Abusive Off - shore Tax Avoidance schemes  Talking Points Jan 2008 ] .
The well - known tax havens are Switzerland / Liechtenstein / Luxemburg / Channel Islands etc .
Could you elaborate and tell us how the money got there in the first place ?
There are several methods / reasons .
Under invoicing / over invoicing of exports and imports and getting the balance stored abroad .
Kickbacks from major defense / civilian contracts .
Not bringing the earnings abroad .
In the old days smuggling of gold and illegal money .
Transactions done abroad and not reported here .
Hawala funds .
Funds earned by artists / entertainment industry / sports people and stashed abroad .
When you want to indulge in adharma , hundreds of ways are open !
We would like to know the terror connection .
Do you think even terrorists are stashing away cash and using the tax haven route to send across money all over the world , to finance their activities ?
M K Narayanan , our National Security Advisor , has spoken about it in Berlin recently .
Advani says that it is important to bring this money back .
How can the government go about it and what are the various ways in which India can get its money back ?
Put it on the Global Agenda .
Put it in G - 20 .
Put it in the International Monetary Fund .
Put it in Egmont Group .
Also take a lead among all developing countries .
Support US / German / French efforts .
If India decides to take the initiative , will the Swiss authorities cooperate ?
It is not due to our pressure but that of US which will make them co-operate .
When a family is in deep financial crisis then it tries to look at the small amount saved under the sugar jar by grandma .
Same way developed economies are desperate for every dollar .
Even if we do not act due to their efforts the list of crooks may be out , then we will be in a dangerous social situation since the who's who of India will be there .
Instead we should get it and get the funds and decide on the steps to sterilise it .
Otherwise , the world will laugh at us .
Politicians sure must be having a lot of money in Swiss Banks .
Do you think this factor will deter the government from acting ?
Public pressure will make them do it .
Plus , the evolving global situation against tax havens .
The money belongs to the poor farmers and unorganised workers of India .
Also , Indian businessmen have a lot of their ill - gotten gains in these banks .
The world situation is such that Indian businessman will want to bring it back now given the attractive returns in India .
Do you think that the Indian government should demand all the Indian black money in Swiss banks ?
Of course .
India should and must act .
We are not a banana republic .
You wrote in your column that the German foreign intelligence agency BND got names of 1,400 clients of the Liechtenstein - based LTG bank who were supposed to be suspected tax evaders .
Of the 1,400 , 600 were supposed to be Germans .
Do you think of the remaining there will be Indians as well ?
Has the Indian government approached the German government for the list ?
Indian names will be there .
Our tax evaders and crooks are like the omnipresent Maha Vishnu -- present in all continents and all tax havens .
But our government has been lukewarm in this issue .
It should have despatched immediately senior officials to get the names .
Is n't it important to tackle the issue of domestic black money ?
It is definitely important .
At least the domestic black money is used in our economy and to that extent it is productive .
But the money kept in Swiss banks is neither useful to India nor does it benefit Indians .
What role should the media play ?
The media has a very important role to play .
At the moment it seems like most part of the media is more interested in the diet of an actress .
Pressure by the media needs to be built up on this issue and remember that a lot of Indians do n't just go to Switzerland to ski .
What about the names of these persons ?
India must try and get the names .
But more importantly should get the money back .
It should be top on the agenda and India ought to take a moral lead in this issue .
Will the Indian economy improve if the money is brought back ?
It will do phenomenally .
India will be in the top five league if all the ill - gotten money is brought back .
It will change the Indian scenario and I have been saying this since 1993 .
Do you think that these people will now try and pull out the money since this issue has become a hot topic ?
I do n't think so .
If they do then India should create an instrument and regulate frameworks to bring the money back .
What kind of punishment do you suggest for these persons ?
Punishment is not the issue now .
There is a need to create fear in them and follow what the international community does on this issue .
Lastly do you think this is becoming just another election issue ?
Whether you 're the kind of coffee drinker that slugs back the swill in the break - room coffee pot at work or savors exotic coffee on sleepy Sundays , there is always room for enhancing your java .

Consider yourself forewarned however , once you begin brewing better coffee it becomes increasingly difficult to go back to enjoying crappy coffee .
Raised in a family of non -coffee drinkers I simply accepted that the coffee I intermittently experienced in diners and donut shops across America was the entirety of the coffee experience — scalding hot , bitter in taste , and certainly not as pleasant a caffeine delivery system as Mountain Dew .
All of that changed when I started drinking more coffee to survive life on the graveyard shift and decided that there had to be a way to make coffee taste good without adding so much sugar into it that I may as well have kept drinking soda .

You wo n't always be able to use all of the following tricks to brew a great cup of coffee — not all of us have access a local coffee roaster or the a well stocked local market — but applying even a few of them to your coffee routine will boost the quality of your coffee drinking experience .
Know Your Varieties

Nearly all the coffee in the world comes from two types of coffee plants : Arabica and Robusta .
Arabica has roughly half the amount of caffeine and a more mellow taste .
Robusta has more caffeine and higher acidic content which creates a significantly more bitter flavor .
Many people experience mild stomach aches from the combination of higher caffeine and acidic content of Robusta beans , certainly many a potential future coffee - drinker has sworn off the stuff because of such an experience with cheap Robusta beans .
It often is n't all that much more to buy Arabica over Robusta and with careful label reading you can often get Arabica coffee for the same price as Robusta based blends .

Buy Whole Beans

When you smell coffee — whether you 're smelling whole beans or already ground coffee — you 're essentially breathing in some of the flavor .
The oils and chemical compounds that give coffee its distinct flavoring are in constant flight from the bean .
The more you can do to preserve the integrity of the beans and the delightful flavor inside right up until the moment of brewing , the better the coffee will be .
Keeping the beans intact for as long as possible helps immensely .
If possible where you live , try to buy locally roasted beans to benefit from the freshness .
Barring that , buying whole bean coffee is vastly superior to buying pre-ground coffee .

Grind Your Own

You 've got whole bean coffee , now what ?
There are two principle types of coffee grinders on the market .
A basic blade grinder costs less than $ 15 at any kitchen store or big box grocer and looks a lot like a tall and narrow food processor .
There is a flat blade at the bottom of the chamber you put your coffee in that spins and grinds up the beans .
The other kind of grinder is a burr grinder and prices for a quality model start at $ 200 and rise rapidly .
Burr models use two interlocking metal burns to create extremely uniform coffee grounds — imagine if you will two cone shaped gears that fit together like nesting dolls .
Coffee aficionados will balk at my suggestion that a blade grinder is adequate , but it 's better to have irregularly but freshly ground coffee than it is to have no coffee at all because you blew $ 500 on a premium coffee grinder !
Grind the coffee as closely to the time it will be used as possible , ideally right before you use it .

Storage

The refrigerator is the mortal enemy of your coffee .
Taking coffee in and out of the fridge is a sure way to suck the flavor right out of it .
Coffee that will be used frequently and immediately — whole bean or ground — is ideally stored in an air tight , opaque , and glass or otherwise inert container .
Coffee that will not be consumed immediately but needs to be preserved for near - future use can be safely stored in the freezer assuming it is stored in a dry and air tight container .
Storing an unsealed container of grounds or beans in the cold temperatures of either the fridge or freezer is a sure way to accelerate the its journey from delicious flavor to stale bitterness .

Press It

Most people would assume if they had less than $ 50 to spend on coffee brewing equipment that there would be no way they could get a premium cup of coffee out of the supplies they could afford .
Fortunately one of the best methods of brewing coffee is the cheapest .
You can pick up a Bodum Chambord French Press , the original and classic design , for $ 25 or less just about everywhere .
Using a French press is one of the simplest methods of brewing a fantastic cup of coffee .
A French press is a glass cylinder that has a lid with a piston style rod attached to a circular screen .
Grind your coffee , put a few heaping scoops in the bottom , pour nearly boiling water over the grounds , wait about four minutes , press the plunger down to push the grounds down and enjoy some delicious coffee .
One of the primary benefits of making coffee in a French press over a standard drip pot is that more of the coffee oils end up in your cup instead of in the machine 's filter .
More oils means better taste !
As a bonus , a carefully cleaned French press can also double as an excellent pot for loose leaf tea .
If you already have a drip pot and want to keep on using it , use a tip we 've previously highlighted as a way to get better coffee out of drip coffee makers : run a pot of water through it before putting the actual coffee through to pre-heat the unit and help get it closer to optimum brewing temperature .

Use Pure(r ) Water
Advertisement
While it might not be practical to install a reverse osmosis filter under your sink , the more pure the water you use for your coffee the better it will taste .
A gallon of locally distilled water costs less than a dollar in most places and many supermarkets have cheap refills available — my local market has a machine that will refill a gallon jug for 35 cents .
Even if you — for environmental or financial reasons — do n't want to spend money on filtered or bottled water for your coffee you can still tweak your water .
Fill up a pitcher of water the night before and set it out on the counter .
While it's not the same as being filtered through the stony depths of a mountain aquifer it will allow some chemicals in the water like chlorine to dissipate .
Anything that makes your cup of joe taste less like the pool at the YMCA is welcome .

1. Frank Sinatra , Come Fly With Me ( 1958 )
One of the first artists to see the possibilities of the album form beyond just throwing a bunch of songs together , Frank Sinatra released thematically united albums throughout his career , starting with his ’50s tenure at Capitol .
Albums like the ballad collection In The Wee Small Hours and the self - describing Songs For Swingin ’ Lovers !
struck a mood and sustained them for 40 minutes or so .
Released in 1958 , the Billy May - arranged Come Fly With
Me explores the romance of travel , starting with the famous title track — written specifically for the album — then winding through songs about Paris , London , Hawaii , and other desirable locales before winding down with the it ’s - no - place - like - home capper “ It ’s Nice To Go Trav’ling . ”
Sinatra ’s enthusiasm for each destination gives off such a contact high that the album feels like taking a vacation without having to leave your living room .

2. Cursive , Domestica ( 2000 )
Chronic hiatus - taker Tim Kasher first disbanded Cursive in the mid-’90s when he married and moved to Oregon .
Luckily for the band , Kasher ’s marriage proved short - lived , inspiring Cursive 's scathing 2000 album Domestica .
Opening with “ The Casualty ” and closing with “ The Night I Lost The Will To Fight , ” Domestica chronicles a tumultuous relationship ( between the characters “ Sweetie ” and “ Pretty Baby ” ) with the subtlety of a ball - peen hammer .
“ Sweetie do n’t cry , ” goes “ The Martyr . ”
“ Your tears are only alibis to prove you still feel / you only feel sorry for yourself / well , get on that cross , that ’s all you 're good for . ”
The storyline does n’t exactly match Kasher ’s experience — he said in an interview that Sweetie and Pretty Baby stay together — but it ’s safe to say that art imitated life .
3. Hüsker Dü , Zen Arcade ( 1984 )
Hüsker Dü’s landmark , drug - fueled double album is a dizzying blur of punk , noisy experimentation , and some of the most potent emotional bloodletting ever recorded .
Underneath the maelstrom lies a semi- comprehensible story about a runaway escaping a bad family life ( “ Broken Home , Broken Heart ” ) , turning to drugs , losing a friend in the process , then returning home — but it was all a dream .
Or something .
Luckily , Zen Arcade ’s 23 tracks do n’t need a shaky storyline to work :
The album contains some of Hüsker Dü's finest moments ( “ Something I Learned Today , ” “ Never Talking To You Again , ” “ Chartered Trips , ” “ Newest Industry ” ) .
4. Pink Floyd , The Wall ( 1979 )
After a series of fractured but spottily brilliant concept albums ( The Dark Side Of The Moon , Wish You Were Here , Animals ) Pink Floyd hit the peak of its ambition and creativity with the double album The Wall , a prog-rock opera based in part on the none - too - pleasant life of then - frontman Roger Waters .
While the 80 - minute storyline can seem a little overcrowded , with its exhausting series of rise - and - fall waves , a series of repeated themes — particularly a slinky , insinuating guitar line and a recurrent melody — hold the music together into one massive piece .
So does the storyline , which is unusually coherent for a concept album :
It follows the emotional withdrawal and eventual disintegration of a man who starts building an internal wall in childhood to deal with his dead father , overprotective mother , abusive teachers , and all the little disappointments of life .
Alan Parker ’s 1982 film version , essentially an extended music video for a slightly altered version of the album , just makes the story clearer — and makes it even harder to think of The Wall as anything but a single long , coherent , agonizing story - song .
5. King Crimson , In The Court Of The Crimson King ( 1969 )
A motherfucker of a prog-rock document , 1969 ’s In The Court Of The Crimson King is an album that can only be listened to as God ( and Robert Fripp ) intended it : split down the middle and nestled within the pink , screaming face of “ 21st Century Schizoid Man , ” the opening salvo ’s titular character .
While the subsequent songs do n’t directly deal with that terrified freak from the then - future , it ’s best to follow the loosely defined Tolkien - meets - Orwell narrative as it weaves through wild jags of proto-metal , freeform funk - jazz , and placid pieces for Mellotron and flute .
Eventually , the story lands face - to - face with King Beelzebub ( a.k.a. Mr. Crimson ) , who turns out to be the instigator behind Vietnam and iPhone dependence .
( It ’s all there in the lyrics , dude . )
Classic .

6. Neutral Milk Hotel , In The Aeroplane Over The Sea ( 1998 )
Just what Jeff Mangum was driving at with Neutral Milk Hotel ’s In The Aeroplane Over The Sea may never be truly understood , but this much is known : Sometime before the seminal album ’s 1998 release , the night - terrors - plagued troubadour became a living conduit for the ghost of Anne Frank .
He molded her misery and joy into a series of extremely vivid , cryptic images , then set them alight on the back of gorgeous raw - spun art - folk .
The record has its highlights ( “ Holland , 1945 , ” is both the album ’s lone single and its lyrical Rosetta Stone ) , but listening straight through is the only way to unravel Aeroplane ’s fantastic riddles while getting delightfully lost in its emotional vales .

7. Deltron 3030 , Deltron 3030 ( 2000 )
A bevy of concept albums ( perhaps the majority ) were surely conceived under the influence of weed , but none are as clearly chronic - fueled as 2000 ’s alterna - rap opera Deltron 3030 .
Reportedly written in two obviously well - considered weeks , the album ’s story revolves around protagonist Deltron Zero ( Del Tha Funkee Homosapien ) as he wages technological war against universe - ruling mega-corps while simultaneously battling to become Galactic Rhyme Federation Champion .
He ’s helped by in - character cameos from a cast that ranges from MC Paul Barman to Damon Albarn .
Most importantly , beyond the numerous nerdy lyrical gems ( “ I wanna devise a virus / better by far than that old Y2 K ” ) and stoned sketches , this album offers rich production from the team of Dan The Automator and Kid Koala , as well as Del ’s most fluid and stylish rhymes to date .

8. Wyclef Jean , Wyclef Jean Presents The Carnival Featuring The Refugee Allstars ( 1997 )
Advertisement
Released one year after The Score proclaimed the creative heft of The Fugees , and one year before Lauryn Hill ’s The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill wrapped that whole thing up , Wyclef Jean ’s The Carnival captures the Refugee Camp primed and ready for … an obscenity trial ?
As a spirited opening skit reveals , ’ Clef is accused of being a bad influence on society ( keep in mind this is before he enlisted The Rock for a single ) , and the songs that follow are supposedly evidence that he is indeed “ a goddamned revolutionary . ”
Jean has never been one for modesty , but here he shows the chops to back it up .
Emboldened by the success of his group but unencumbered by its stardom , he enlists Hill , Pras , John Forté , Celia Cruz , the Neville brothers , and Bob Marley ’s I Threes to concoct an ambitious art - rap opus .
9 . The Flaming Lips , Zaireeka ( 1997 )
If only due to the difficulty of properly executing a Zaireeka listening , this “ album ” comprising four discs to be played simultaneously is truly a “ start - to - finish ” experience .
But The Flaming Lips had a bit more in mind when they released the polarizing project in 1997 .
Zaireeka is by nature a communal occurrence , and it ’s just as anarchic and eye - opening as its name , a portmanteau of “ Zaire ” and “ eureka , ” implies .
The phasing layers of Lipsian psychedelia emit strange visceral waves capable of inspiring joyful cry sessions and , occasionally , spatial disorientation accompanied by nausea .
Add to that a series of existentially ruminative narratives , and you ’ve got a surprisingly compact time machine capable of transporting listeners back to the blank slate of youth .

10 . Parenthetical Girls , Entanglements ( 2008 )
Parenthetical Girls ’ Entanglements possesses all the best qualities of a superb concept album .
Lavish music ?
Check .
Theatrical vocals ?
Check .
Linear storyline written in an obsolete vernacular ?
Check .
Misunderstood in its time ?
Double check .
Its ornately wrought chapters , which unravel a lifetime of lust and love shared between two genderless characters with a sizeable age gap — need to be digested in sequential order , with lyric book in hand .
It may seem like a lot of effort , but it ’s highly rewarding work taking in the Todd Solondz - like narrative over orchestral art - pop that undulates between Van Dyke Parks highs and Scott Walker lows .

11 . Dr. Octagon , Dr. Octagonecologyst ( 1996 )
Kool Keith ’s Dr. Octagon persona made for one of the most fragmented , confusing character studies in the concept - album realm .
As if using the character as an excuse to get somewhere else entirely , Keith embraces the potential for near - nonsense verse wizardry on 1996 ’s Dr. Octagonecologyst .
Even the most expository lines of this tale of some kind of sociopathic , horny alien gynecologist ( hell , if even that much is clear ) teeter on the edge of pure , percussive wordplay .
Dan
The Automator ’s production also walks that line between classic form and deliciously surreal concept , teetering between old - fashioned rhythmic thump and the bleak , queasy feeling of preparing to get sucked out of an airlock .
Keith reveals the character like a sculptor taking seemingly random jabs at a piece of marble , yet the seeming randomness lends itself to confoundingly catchy flows .

12 . Sufjan Stevens , Illinois ( 2005 )
Not satisfied with just one or two concept albums , Sufjan Stevens set out to record a concept collection , with 50 albums , each dedicated to one of the 50 states .
We ’re still waiting on 48 of them , but his most recent contribution , 2005 ’s Illinois , was enough of a success that he could rest on his laurels a bit before moving on to a ( potentially smaller or less complicated ) state .
With 22 songs each focusing on Illinois history , from the criminal to the bizarre , there ’s enough minutiae in the lyrics to keep over - analyzers happy for weeks , matching up the references to towns , people , and historical events from the Land Of Lincoln , both well - known and less - so .
Stevens ’
Illinois is a bustling yet melancholy , beautiful , sometimes - surprising and mysterious place , which seems to be exactly what Stevens took away from his research , and decided to share with listeners .
He may end up feeling that way that about all the states , but as long as the stories are there and the music is surprising and beautiful , who cares ?

13 . Catherine Wheel , Adam And Eve ( 1997 )
Catherine
Wheel ’s swooping Adam And Eve was up against some stiff competition when it came to 1997 sorta - concept albums by British bands with a couple of hits under their belts .
( In case the reference is n’t clear enough : OK Computer . )
Adam And Eve was apparently too ambitious or ill - timed to hit the big time , in spite of the huge singles “ Delicious ” and “ Ma Solituda . ”
Maybe that ’s because it ’s best to listen in one big chunk , with the spare , bluesy “ Intro ” and “ Outro ” bookending the band ’s strongest set of recorded material .
There ’s no real theme per se , but at least a few running ideas about the future .
But it all means something , maaaaan .

14 . Randy Newman , Good Old Boys ( 1974 )
Originally conceived as a song cycle about a prototypical Southern everyman called Johnny Cutler ’s Birthday ( in which raw form it can be found on a 2002 double - disc re-release from Rhino ) , Randy Newman ’s greatest triumph does n’t have any particular narrative , but its tone is as consistent as any rock opera ever recorded .
Playing out as a cross-generational gallery of voices from the American South , it features songs that are as striking now as they were 35 years ago , like the moving “ Louisiana 1927 ” ( powerfully re-recorded by Newman after Katrina ) and “ Mr. President ( Have Pity On The Working Man ) , ” originally written as a plea to Nixon , but newly relevant in these days of economic collapse .
And for Northerners who smugly judge the goons and grotesques portrayed in Good Old Boys , there ’s “ Rednecks , ” one of the composer ’s most notorious — and misunderstood — songs , which begins as a blunt satire of the racist South , and ends with a crushing condemnation of Yankee hypocrisy .

15 . Queensrÿche , Operation : Mindcrime ( 1988 )
Concept albums in the world of heavy metal are a dime a dozen , and narrowing it down to prog-metal devalues the concept even further .
When a guy thinks he ’s an intellectual because he figured out how to play Bach on his Ibanez Destroyer , flatulent , pretentious narratives are the first item on his agenda .
But Queensrÿche ’s Operation : Mindcrime succeeds not only because its musicianship is exceptional — every song on the album is worth listening to , from the powerful opening “ I Remember Now ” to the harrowing minor - key masterpiece “ Eyes Of A Stranger ” that closes it out — but also because the story is well - written enough to not be an embarrassment .
Years later , an ill - thought - out sequel tarnished the original ’s purity ( not to mention robbing it of the appealing ambiguity over who killed Sister Mary ) , but taken alone , it still stands a monument to the blistering power of Geoff Tate and Chris DeGarmo in their heyday .

16 . Tom Waits , Franks Wild Years ( 1987 )
The song “ Frank ’s Wild Years ” is one of the best numbers off Tom Waits ’ groundbreaking Swordfishtrombones , a jazzy , gin-soaked little narrative about a furniture salesman in a dead - end marriage who burns down his house and drives off into the night .
Waits liked it so much that he expanded into a rock opera ( excuse , please : an “ operachi romantico in two parts ” ) a few years later .
Hopping from one musical style to another to suit its loose narrative of a “ guy who ’s a success at being a failure and a failure at being a success , ” the album is an epic without consequence , a grand opera about a big - talking loser .
It ’s also one of Waits ’ greatest records , featuring an all - star cast and some amazing songs , including the opening number “ Hang On St. Christopher , ” “ Temptation , ” “ Way Down In The Hole , ” and not one but two fantastic renditions of “ Innocent When You Dream . ”

17 . Mike Watt , Contemplating The Engine Room ( 1997 )
The idea of a “ punk opera ” justifiably makes a lot of people ’s skins crawl .
But if anything is worthy of the name — and worthy of the highest praise that such a project can receive — it ’s this unforgettable album by the former bass player for the Minutemen .
The stirring lyrics skillfully mix the story of Watt ’s dad , a Navy veteran , with that of Watt ’s own adventures in the early days of American punk rock , with a memorable cast of characters drawn from the L.A. scene of the early ’ 80s .
And musically , it ’s probably Watt ’s greatest accomplishment , truly operatic in scope and form , with nautical thematic elements that disappear and reappear from the powerful opening bass hook of the main theme to the heartbreaking memorial to D. Boon , “ Shore Duty , ” that ends the album .
Watt was so determined to present it in its purest form that he twice toured the country performing it from beginning to end , and as anyone who caught those shows can testify , his passion for the material showed through at every stop .

18 . XTC , Skylarking ( 1986 )
Skylarking is proof that a concept album does n’t have to start out that way to be great .
When Andy Partridge and Colin Moulding starting writing the songs that would end up on Skylarking , they did n’t have much idea that it would be a song cycle ; by the time they were finished , it very nearly was n’t even an album .
They chose pop-music impresario Todd Rundgren off a short list of producers suggested by their record label , and it was loathing at first sight .
But Rundgren sussed that there was a strong thematic element to the terrific set of songs the band turned in , and , years later — after endless complications , messy resequencing , and contradictory stories from all involved — Moulding still considers it XTC ’s greatest record .
Even if the concept is a little vague ( youth , adolescence , work , marriage , childbirth , death , the whole Ben Casey megillah ) , there ’s no doubt the album is best experienced from beginning to end .

19 . Bruce Springsteen , Nebraska ( 1982 )
Springsteen ’s sixth album represented a distinct departure from his earlier work ; after the sprawling , populist rock of Born To Run and The River , Nebraska is more intimate , sparser , and waaaay more depressing .
Some songs can be as good as short stories , and Nebraska is a collection of the Boss ’ best stories , an anthology best appreciated from start to finish .
Taken on their own , “ Used Cars , ” “ Atlantic City , ” “ Johnny 99 , ” and the rest are haunting , beautifully sketched character studies , but when heard in combination , they create a world full of stunted lives , missed opportunities , and endless , aching regret .
Some of them , like “ Highway Patrolman ” and “ State Trooper , ” seem to comment directly on each other , and the album ’s closer , “ Reason To Believe , ” gains power from the accumulation of lost souls that precedes it .
It ’s a world worth visiting , even if no one would ever want to live there .

20 . Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds , Murder Ballads ( 1996 )
Nick Cave is no stranger to dark music , but Murder Ballads is something else entirely : a collection of songs so grim and threatening that it ’s hard to imagine the black getting any more pitch .
Tunes like “ Song Of Joy ” and “ The Kindness Of Strangers ” send a shiver down the spine so deep that the vibrations can last for days ; why , then , would anyone want to listen to all 10 tracks in one sitting ?
Well , some people like their uncomfortable feelings permanent , but for the sane folks , going all the way through Ballads points to the mordant wit at the heart of Cave ’s work .
The black , rollicking humor of “ Curse Of Millhaven ” is a breath of fresh air after the visions of death and betrayal preceding it , but the real treat is “ O’ Malley ’s Bar , ” a 14 - minute epic about a bratty sociopath ’s killing spree .
On its own , “ Bar ” is a snotty treat , but in the context of the despair that surrounds it , the song becomes a grinning , nihilistic howl , a raspberry at all the dread and gloom .
The cover of Bob Dylan ’s “ Death Is Not The End ” that follows is a fitting coda for an album that does n’t so much chart human degradation as revel in it , finding a freedom in realizing no matter what happens , sooner or later , it all ends up in the ground .

21 . Masta Ace , Disposable Arts ( 2001 )
For some artists , concept albums are like Frito Lay potato chips :
You ca n’t have just one .
Juice Crew legend Masta
Ace has established himself as something of a concept - album master since resurrecting his career in the early part of this decade as a veteran storyteller looking back on his life and career with self - deprecating humor and refreshing candor on 2001 ’s Disposable Arts .
The album opens with Ace being released from prison and enrolling in the Institute Of Disposable Arts , where his roommate is an excessively chipper MC Paul Barman .
The album closes on an appropriately elegiac mood :
On the moving “ No Regrets , ” the aging MC explores the realities of being a veteran struggling just to hang on in the Darwinian ecosystem of the music business , and he plays his own worst critic on “ Dear Diary . ”
Ace followed it up with a better - received but weaker prequel two years later in A Long Hot Summer .

22 . Willie Nelson , Phases And Stages ( 1974 )
Undeterred by the failure of his spacey 1971 ’s concept album Yesterday ’s Wine , Willie Nelson returned to the trough three years later with Phases And Stages , an exquisitely sad but ultimately hopeful roman à clef album about the dissolution of a marriage .
Phases And Stages introduced a classic single in “ Bloody Mary Morning , ” a song that ’s great as a standalone track , but gains in resonance and meaning from being part of a cohesive , ambitious song cycle .
The third time proved a charm for Nelson , concept - album - wise .
While Wine and Stages failed commercially , his third concept album , Red Headed Stranger , made him an iconic star in 1975 .

23 . Prince Paul , Psychoanalysis : What Is It ? ( 1996 )
Prince Paul is the undisputed king of hip - hop concept albums .
He helped usher in the era of hip - hop skits as the innovative producer of De La Soul ’s first albums , but as a solo artist , his conceptual genius really took flight .
1999 ’s A Prince Among
Thieves was a full - fledged narrative tour de force about an aspiring rapper who falls prey to the allure of street life ;
Paul ’s longtime friend / fan / collaborator Chris Rock promptly scooped up the film rights .
That release was preceded by the much more abstract , satisfying semi-instrumental Psychoanalysis : What Is It ? , a darkly funny album that put hip - hop on the couch for a trippy album - length exploration of its dark soul , various mutations , and creepy compulsions .

24 . Drive - By Truckers , Southern Rock Opera ( 2001 )
Neo -Southern - rock act Drive - By Truckers had only two obscure indie records and one incendiary live album under their belts when they decided to swing for the fences .
Raising money from a group of colleagues and fans , the band recorded the double - disc Southern Rock Opera , a sprawling meditation on redneck identity politics and how the looming specter of mortality makes life — and rock ’ n ’ roll — more meaningful .
Though less song - oriented than the DBT albums before and after it , Southern Rock Opera is no less fiery , and it contains some of Patterson Hood ’s most personal reflections on how he ’s come to embrace his Southern heritage while rejecting some of its more negative connotations .
In the spoken - word piece “ The Three Great Alabama Icons , ” Hood weaves together his personal histories with Lynyrd Skynyrd , Bear Bryant , and George Wallace into a complex statement on prejudice that ’s like a rock ’n ’ roll version of Marjane Satrapi ’s graphic novel Persepolis .
Like the album as a whole , it ’s storytelling on a much higher plane than most shit - kicker rock bands ever aspire to .
25 . The Who , Quadrophenia ( 1973 )
Given Pete Townshend ’s art - school inclinations , it ’s no surprise that throughout his career — solo and with The Who — he ’s tried to apply his facility with memorable guitar licks and catchy tunes to projects that aim to tell long , complex stories .
Often those projects are more than a little esoteric ( like Tommy ) , or so complicated that Townshend ca n’t bring them to fruition ( like Lifehouse ) , but with 1973 ’s Quadrophenia , Townshend and The Who finally recorded a rock opera that made sense both as one long story and as a powerful , emotional piece of music .
Using his bandmates ’ personalities as metaphors for mixed - up adolescence , Townshend took listeners back to London and Brighton circa 1964 and ’ 65 , when the rise of “ mod ” ( as exemplified by bands like The Who ) gave teens with fashion sense and a love of American R&B their own tribe to run with .
It ’s a set of songs about belonging and eventual disillusionment , and for all its cultural specificity , Quadrophenia is about as universal in its concept as concept albums get .
This week several scary stories surfaced about how the MPAA and RIAA are negotiating with ISPs on how to deal with copyright infringers .
Even though it was often presented as news , those who look deeper will realize that this is nothing new at all , just the same old threats dressed up in a new jacket .
It ’s has been a good week for the entertainment industry lobbyists .
Hundreds of news outlets wrote in detail about how the RIAA and MPAA are negotiating with Internet service providers to warn alleged copyright infringers .
No one seemed to notice that this is n’t really news as they ’ve been working together for years , with ISPs passing on warnings to their customers on behalf of the studios .
It all started with rumors about two US ISPs , Comcast and AT&T , who were said to be doing a three - strikes deal with the RIAA .
It soon became known that this rumor was completely fabricated , but not before hundreds of other news oulets reproduced the story .
At the end of the week it turned out that there was no news at all .
Yes , the RIAA , MPAA and other outfits do plan to send copyright infringement warnings to ISPs , but they ’ve been doing so for at least half a decade .
Every other month these Hollywood lobbyists pitch their anti-piracy efforts to the public , and that ’s exactly what they are paid for .
This does n’t mean , however , that something is about to change .
The anti-piracy outfits are happy with all the free publicity of course , that is exactly what they are after .
Their purpose is to scare people .
In this post we hope to clear up some of the misunderstandings , as we show that the scary stories published this week have no substance at all .
Copyright infringement warnings ?
For years , content owners such as record labels or movie studios have been sending copyright infringement notices to ISPs , who are legally obliged to forward these to their customers .
Some ISPs simply ignore them , while others faithfully forward the emails to the customer account associated with the infringing IP - address .
Many ISPs do n’t keep records of these events .
So , is my ISP spying on me ?
No .
This is a common misunderstanding .
ISPs do n’t look into your specific downloading behavior , they never have and there is no indication that this will change anytime in the near future .
All the ‘ evidence ’ comes from organizations that work for the copyright holders .
What do they know about me ?
If you receive a warning , all copyright holders know about you at this stage is your IP - address and what files were ( partially ) shared via your account , or more accurately – the bill payer ’s account .
The MPAA , RIAA and others do n’t know your name and they never will unless they get a court order forcing your ISP to hand over the information .
In the bigger picture , this is very rare .
Information provided in a typical copyright warning .
How did they track me down ?
The copyright holders hire companies such as BayTSP and DtecNet to track down people who share certain titles on BitTorrent and other file - sharing networks .
They join the swarm and request files from others .
When someone shares a piece of the file with them they log the IP - address , look up the ISP and send out a copyright infringement notice automatically .
Unlike the file - sharers , these companies are authorized to download these files , so they are not infringing copyright themselves .
Will I get sued if I receive a warning through my ISP ?
No .
These copyright infringement warnings are not related to any legal action .
Copyright holders do go after people who share their work on file - sharing networks , but this has nothing to do with the warnings they send out via ISPs .
Will they take my Internet away ?
No .
Although there is a lot of talk about “ three strikes ” policies , no ISP has agreed ( or was forced ) to disconnect users after they receive their third warning .
In New Zealand they came close to implementing a law that would require ISPs to do this , but this proposal was pulled .
In France they are also considering three strikes legislation , but this has not passed into action yet .
In Ireland the largest ISP Eircom said it would disconnect repeated infringers only if they receive a court order .
It is worth mentioning though that ISPs may cut off people whenever they think it ’s necessary .
Cox does this in the US for example , without an agreement with the MPAA or RIAA .
ISPs have terms and conditions and most forbid copyright infringement , but really this is just to cover their own backs under the law .
Do I have to be worried ?
Receiving a regular infringement notice is nothing to be worried about .
However , if you download copyrighted files without authorization from the copyright holder you are breaking the law in some countries .
If you receive a warning without having shared anything yourself ( which happens quite often ) then there ’s nothing to worry about .
Can I protect ( hide ) myself ?
If you do n’t want to be spied on when using BitTorrent the best option is to hide your IP - address .
You can do so by subscribing to a VPN service .
Blocklist software such as PeerGuardian is often recommended , but it is also highly ineffective as the lists are never fully up - to date or accurate .
What ’s the point in all this ?
The MPAA and RIAA do n’t want their products on file - sharing networks and they use these warning emails to deter people from sharing these files with others .
Since it ’s much cheaper ( and effective ) than suing people , this is now their strategy of choice .
Using news outlets to spread their doom and gloom scenarios is just part of their operation .
In the future the amount of warnings they send out to alleged infringers will increase and the studios and ISPs will work together to keep the associated operating costs down , if that ’s not what they ’ve already been doing in their recent meetings .
It ’s just the old model , scaled up with a rumor or two on top .
Let ’s move on already .
Oh no !
Your mom just joined Facebook and what 's even worse , she wants to be your friend .
More and more people are finding themselves in this situation today and unsure of what to do .
Friending mom and dad , the boss , or other work colleagues opens up the details of your private life for the whole world to see - and you might not be entirely comfortable with that .
What 's to be done ?
The Big Question : Should You Bare it All Online ?
It 's still up for debate how much personal information you should share with others on your Facebook profile .
Some people would argue that the time for us to hide behind our masks is over .
If we 're professional , good employees at work and good sons and daughters at home , it should n't matter so much if a friend tags us in a photo which shows us tipping back beers at the weekend party .
The fact is , everyone has a personal life and it should n't matter who sees it .
Others would say that those are precisely the sorts of photos that make it dangerous to use online social networks like Facebook for both personal and business networking .
" Do n't friend the boss , " they would argue .
It 's just too risky .
Sharing Some Things , Not Others
The issue is n't really that black and white , though .
You may feel it 's OK for your colleagues to see some of your Facebook photos ( like those from the conference you attended ) , but not others ( like those from the party ) .
You also may be a little uncomfortable with the boss reading your wall posts , especially if your friends have an odd sense of humor at times .
If you 're not ready to expose everything about you to anyone who asks to be your online friend , it 's time you learned how to use Facebook 's friend lists .
A little over a year ago , Facebook launched a new feature called " Friend Lists . "
With lists , you can create groups of friends on Facebook , separating work from family and close friends .
It 's simple to use , but it 's definitely an underutilized feature .
In fact , most of the people who spend their days " Facebooking , " never seem to take the time to worry about who 's seeing what ... until it 's too late .
But now , as more older generations are going online and joining social networks , the " Should I Friend Mom / Dad / Boss ? " issue is becoming more prevalent than ever .
How To Use Friend Lists
To get started with Facebook Lists , you first need to build one .
You can do this from your Friends page .
( Click " Friends " in the blue bar at the top ) .
On the left side of the page , click the button " Make a New List . "
Give it a title .
Now you 'll have the option to add your friends to the list .
You can either start typing in names one by one or click on " Select Multiple Friends " to add several people to the list all at once .
( To add people , just click on their photos . )
When you 're finished , click the " Save List " button at the bottom .
Once you have some lists created , it 's time to figure out who gets to see what .
To edit your privacy settings , go to " Settings " at the top - right of the screen next to the search box .
When you hover your mouse over the link , you 'll see a menu appear ; click " Privacy Settings " on this menu .
On the following page , click " Profile , " the top choice in the list of options .
On the profile privacy page , you have the option of customizing exactly who gets to see what .
You can modify the following areas : Profile , Basic Info , Personal Info , Status Updates , Photos Tagged of You , Videos Tagged of You , Friends , Wall Posts , Education Info , and Work Info .
If you 're unsure of what any of those things are , click the " ? " next to the item to read a definition .
Using the drop - down boxes , you can customize who gets to see your info : " Only Friends , " " Friends of Friends , " or " My Network of Friends . "
To lock down your profile to friends only , you could set all these to " only friends . "
But since you have now created specialized lists , you 'll want to use these instead .
To do so , click the fourth option from the drop - down box : " Customize . "
From here , you can add lists of people who should NOT be able to see this part of your profile .
For example , if you wanted to block a list of work colleagues or those in your family from seeing your status updates , you could do so here - just type the name of your list in the box " Except these people " and save your changes .
Note : you can also block certain people individually just by typing in their names , but given the ever - growing number of Facebook users , you 're probably going to need a Friend List at some point .
We recommend biting the bullet and creating your lists now instead of treating everyone as a one - off .
After you 've saved your changes , you 're done .
You 'll have your privacy back without having to change the way you and your friends use Facebook .
Of course , keep in mind that nothing is foolproof - determined hackers can gain access to your account as can anyone who guesses your password .... so maybe you should n't use your dog 's name .
When lists are finally in place , you can assign new friends to a list right when you 're accepting their friend request - just look for the option " Add to Friend List " before you click " Accept . "
It may seem like quite a bit of work to set up , but you 'll thank yourself for doing this later ... like every Monday morning when you go back to work after a great weekend ... or the next time you need to borrow money from mom and dad .
You get the idea .
Better safe than sorry .
COCAINE - using clubbers were refused entry to a Blackburn nightclub after a high - tech ‘ magic torch ’ device revealed they had been sniffing the drug .
Officers shone a special torch at customers that showed up traces of the drug on people ’s hands and faces in bright green .
Four men were stopped from entering Liquid and Envy nightclub in the town centre on Friday night .
The torch was being piloted in Blackburn town centre and was so effective a further 15 torches , worth £ 40 each , will now be purchased to be used elsewhere in East Lancashire .
Police hope the device will lead to a reduction in town centre violence and drug dealing .
Sergeant Alan Clayton said : “ This simple piece of equipment will have a big impact on drug use in pubs and clubs .
" It looks like a normal LED torch but if it is pointed at the person ’s nose and mouth area it shows up bright green if they have been taking the drug .
“ It is even easy to see the minute cocaine crystals secreted within the nasal hair . ”
“ Small traces of cocaine are also left on the cheeks and chin that are not visible to the naked eye and these show up bright green too .
It really is amazing . ”
He added : “ When people have been drinking it gives them dutch courage .
“ When they have taken cocaine it can give them an almost super strength and the two in combination can lead to violent outbursts .
“ This torch could reduce trouble in future and it could also cut down on people going into venues and selling drugs . ”
Kevin Riley , a partner in Fusion nightclub , Burnley ’s largest venue , based in Hammerton Street , welcomed the arrival of the device .
He said : “ This is a good idea and will help us in our bid to reduce drug use in Burnley ’s clubs scene .
“ We get associated with drugs more than most , as a dance music venue , and this will probably be more beneficial for us than other places . ”
The torch can also highlight traces of smart water , uses to protect property from being stolen , by turning areas that it has been put on bright yellow .
And it has an ultra violet function which can help in the use of identifying forged notes , identification cards and UV marked property .
Sgt Clayton said the torch was used overtly and had been received well by the public .
He added that door staff all over town had been really impressed and were asking if they would be able to get the torches as well .
Glyn sez , " The EU 's Telecoms Package is back for its second reading .
The French are attempting to push through their ' three strikes and you 're out ' approach again , the UK are attempting to get rid of net neutrality and get rid of peoples right to privacy .
The ITRE / IMCO committee are meeting on the 31 March 2009 to dicuss these and other alarming amendments .
The Open Rights Group have more details : "
One of the most controversial issues is that of the three - strikes strongly and continuously pushed by France in the EU Council .
Although most of the dispositions introducing the graduate response system were rejected in first reading of the Telecom Package , there are still some alarming ones persisting .
France is trying hard to get rid of Amendment 138 which seeks to protect users ' rights against the three - strikes sanctions and which , until now , has stopped the EU from applying the three - strikes policy .
Also , some new amendments reintroduce the notion of lawful content , which will impose the obligation on ISPs to monitor content going through their networks .
The UK government is pushing for the " wikipedia amendments " ( so - called because one of them has been created by cutting and pasting a text out of the wikipedia ) in order to allow ISPs to make limited content offers .
The UK amendments eliminate the text that gives users rights to access and distribute content , services and applications , replacing it with a text that says " there should be transparency of conditions under which services are provided , including information on the conditions to and / or use of applications and services , and of any traffic management policies . " …
Also a very dangerous amendment to the ePrivacy directive is introduced by the UK , allowing the telecommunications industry to collect a potentially unlimited amount of users ' sensitive and confidential communications data including telephone and e-mail contacts , geographic position of mobile phones and websites visited on the Internet .
Charles Freeman , a veteran diplomat slated to become the top U.S. intelligence analyst , withdrew from consideration Tuesday .
He released a statement denouncing the " Israel Lobby " for " character assassination . "
Here is the text of the statement .
To all who supported me or gave me words of encouragement during the controversy of the past two weeks , you have my gratitude and respect .
You will by now have seen the statement by Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair reporting that I have withdrawn my previous acceptance of his invitation to chair the National Intelligence Council .
I have concluded that the barrage of libelous distortions of my record would not cease upon my entry into office .
The effort to smear me and to destroy my credibility would instead continue .
I do not believe the National Intelligence Council could function effectively while its chair was under constant attack by unscrupulous people with a passionate attachment to the views of a political faction in a foreign country .
I agreed to chair the NIC to strengthen it and protect it against politicization , not to introduce it to efforts by a special interest group to assert control over it through a protracted political campaign .
As those who know me are well aware , I have greatly enjoyed life since retiring from government .
Nothing was further from my mind than a return to public service .
When Admiral Blair asked me to chair the NIC I responded that I understood he was " asking me to give my freedom of speech , my leisure , the greater part of my income , subject myself to the mental colonoscopy of a polygraph , and resume a daily commute to a job with long working hours and a daily ration of political abuse . "
I added that I wondered " whether there was n't some sort of downside to this offer . "
I was mindful that no one is indispensable ; I am not an exception .
It took weeks of reflection for me to conclude that , given the unprecedentedly challenging circumstances in which our country now finds itself abroad and at home , I had no choice but accept the call to return to public service .
I thereupon resigned from all positions that I had held and all activities in which I was engaged .
I now look forward to returning to private life , freed of all previous obligations .
Australia 's bankruptcy rates have increased by 261 per cent over nearly 20 years , according to a study by the Melbourne Law School .
The study 's author , Professor Ian Ramsay , says bankruptcy has now hit the nation 's middle class , with a 50 per cent rise in insolvency in New South Wales alone .
" That rate of increase dramatically exceeds , for example , the increase in population in Australia over the corresponding period , " he said .
" So , effectively , a greater proportion of the Australian population , over the period that we examined , was becoming personally insolvent . "
Comparing the last six months of 2008 with the last six months of 2007 , the study found a 12 per cent jump in bankruptcies over the past year alone .
Professor Ramsay says Australia 's love affair with credit is the main cause .
Over the last 10 years , excessive use of credit as a cause of non-business related bankruptcies has gone up by more than 100 per cent , " he said .
" Over the period of time we 've found quite a significant increase in the age of bankrupts .
We also found ill health as a growing reason for people going bankrupt .
" One interesting finding was gambling .
What we found was a significant increase in the last 10 years , up something like 230 per cent , as a cause of bankruptcy . "
Professor Ramsay says bankruptcy is becoming more of a middle class phenomenon .
" Effectively , we found that bankrupts are coming from higher status occupations , " he said .
" They also have increasing levels of both personal income , but also household income .
They also have increasing assets and property ownership levels .
" So even during these times , where there was strong economic growth in Australia , we still found that bankruptcy was claiming , if you like , more and more of the Australian middle class .
" We found a growing number of bankrupts with dependents .
So , clearly there 's an important family context here . "
The most significant increase in bankruptcies has occurred in New South Wales .
" In fact , a 50 per cent increase in the proportion of bankruptcies occurring in New South Wales between 1997 and 2008 , " he said .
" And that 's not just a factor of New South Wales having more people , it is that there 's just more bankruptcies occurring in that state . "
The study investigated personal insolvency under the Bankruptcy Act , from 1990 until 2008 .
That covered Australia 's economic boom time .
Professor Ramsay predicts bankruptcy rates will skyrocket in the months and years ahead .
" Looking ahead though , of course , the conclusion would need to be , in my view , that these trends would actually accelerate , " he said .
" And what are those trends ?
The trends are a greater number of Australians becoming personally insolvent and , of course , personal insolvency , including bankruptcy , affecting more and more parts of the Australian society , including the Australian middle class . "
Financial and Consumer Rights Council executive officer Richard Foster says he is not surprised by the figures .
" This is a case of ' greed is bad ' , " he said .
" We are seeing an increasing number of people coming to financial counsellors and consumer advocates with no option other than to consider bankruptcy .
" What 's concerning most about the study is that it commenced at the height of the last recession and the numbers have only gone up ever since .
So , what we can expect in the future , I expect , is more of the same . "
As the Supreme Court entered the chamber last night , it was nice to see Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg return to the court and make a public appearance after undergoing surgery for cancer of the pancreas .
In a sign of respect , the other justices that came in behind her actually slowed their pace and walked behind her since she still is recovering -- except Clarence Thomas .
This was her moment , and he barged over it like an ignorant teenager .
It did n't take that long for her to get to her seat , but he could n't be bothered to wait and barged right past her .
I watched the entirety of it and it was n't like he had very far to go .
She became an object of affection by the media and the Congress as she has come back so quickly .
I know he wishes her no ill will , but Clarence could show a little respect at least .
Apple appears to be distributing a new firmware update that will attempt to address flickering and blank video issues on the latest generation of MiniDisplay Port - equipped Macs connected to external displays using the company 's Mini DisplayPort to VGA Adapter .
The Cupertino - based company is believed to have been working on the update since last fall when early adopters of the new unibody MacBook Pros began experiencing issues when connected to an external display , where the display would sporadically lose signal for a few seconds and flick back on .
Since then , it appears that external display issues have spread to a variety of other new Macs equipped with Mini DisplayPorts , in particular the new Mac mini .
There are quite a few threads ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) on the Apple support discussion boards pertaining to similar issues , though not all involve problems when using the Mini DisplayPort to VGA Adapter .
For those users who are connected to an external display via the Mini DisplayPort to VGA Adapter , Apple is quietly distributing an 11.2MB " Mini DisplayPort to VGA Firmware Update " over Software Update that will reportedly update the firmware on the adapter itself .
" This firmware update addresses intermittent flickering and compatibility issues such as no video on some external displays when using the Mini DisplayPort to VGA Adapter on your Mini DisplayPort enabled Mac , " the company says in a brief set of release notes .
" The Mini DisplayPort to VGA Adapter firmware update will be downloaded to the Utilities folder and will automatically launch to update the firmware on the Mini DisplayPort to VGA Adapter . "
In order to trigger the update , Apple says the Mini DisplayPort to VGA Adapter must be plugged into your Mac and a compatible VGA display .
The company also says that the Mac 's power adapter must be plugged into a power outlet if the Mac is a notebook .
Former Orange County Sheriff Michael S. Carona was sentenced this afternoon to 66 months in federal prison and fined $ 125,000 in a high - profile corruption case .
The corruption case cast a long shadow over the state ’s second - largest sheriff ’s department and shattered the career of a man many believed had the personality and political chops to carry him to Sacramento , or even Washington .
Carona was convicted in January of witness - tampering after a two - month trial , peppered with accounts of influence peddling within his administration .
[ Updated at 5:18 p.m. : Federal Judge Andrew Guilford was harsh as he handed down the sentence following a four - hour hearing during which the former sheriff ’s attorneys argued for leniency , saying the media had sensationalized the case .
“ Lying will not be tolerated in this courtroom , especially by law enforcement , especially by the leading law enforcement official in the county , " said Guilford , who held up a copy of the book “ The Importance of Being Honest ” and read a passage to Carona .
Carona , dressed in a gray suit and blue necktie , spoke only briefly , thanking Guilford for his “ kindness and courtesy . ”
“ Mr. Carona violated his sworn duty and utterly ignored his responsibilities to the citizens of Orange County by engaging in the conduct that led to his conviction and sentence , conduct that culminated in an agreement to obstruct justice by concocting a story to cover up his corrupt behavior , ” said United States Attorney Thomas P. O’Brien in a statement .
“ Today ’s sentencing shows what will happen to elected officals who place their own interests above those of the constituents they are sworn to serve . ”
Carona will be held on bail pending appeal until July 24 .
The judge wanted him to be able to see his son's graduation . ]
Witness testimony exposed raw details of his relationship with a longtime mistress , complete with tales of a love nest , Vegas getaways and secret bank accounts .
Witnesses talked of bribes handed over in cash - stuffed envelopes , hidden cameras in the Sheriff ’s Department and reserve badges for donors and the politically connected .
Jurors , though , acquitted Carona of charges that he misused his office to enrich himself and others by taking cash , bribes and gifts including vacations , World Series tickets and ringside boxing tickets .
Jurors said that although they believed Carona had accepted cash and gifts , the statute of limitations prevented them from considering many of the alleged acts underlying the case .

The release of the Bush Administration 's memos on torture has the media and blogosphere alight , with a ferocious debate on Obama 's decision not to prosecute the people responsible .
The memos revealed what we already knew - the codification of the use of torture , and the legal manipulation the Bush Administration used to justify it .

Obama must be given fair credit for his decision to publish the memos , but his refusal to prosecute those guilty of war crimes is a massive blow to his image as a true reformer .
It adds to the nagging notion that Obama is indeed just another politician , a cautious centrist without the courage to follow his convictions .
Obama has urged the nation to move on from the disgusting behavior of the Bush Administration saying it is a " time for reflection , not retribution . "
How Obama can justify this to himself is beyond me .
Those guilty of torturing other human beings , regardless of the legal advice they were given by their superiors , should be put in prison .
As should those who ordered it , and those who condoned it .
' Following orders ' is not an excuse for such crimes , and to claim otherwise disgraces the trials at Nuremberg and the ideals the international community have striven to build over the past 60 years .

We should also be mindful that this is a minor footnote in the enormous litany of crimes committed by the Bush Administration .
While the codification of torture is horrific , the act of preemptive war is far worse , and there is little from the new administration or mainstream media about that .
The memos that definitively proved the use of torture as policy provided a glimpse of hope for the progressive community that the Bush Administration may be held accountable for at least some of its crimes .
Now that glimmer has gone .

Skype ( s EBAY ) will release a version of its VoIP application for the iPhone and the iPod touch on Tuesday , according to The Wall Street Journal .
I was the first to report news of the pending release last week .
( Gee , thanks for giving us credit , WSJ and CNET ’s News.com . )
If you skip past what is essentially a lot of repackaged information in the WSJ , there are two valuable bits of new information :
Skype will use Wi-Fi networks , and calls to landlines will cost 2.1 cents a minute .
There is no calling over the 3G network .
( Not that AT&T ’s ( s T ) network can actually take any more pressure . )
SkypeIn and SkypeOut , along with Skype Chat , are the key features of this new version of the Skype application .
This is a native P2P application for the iPhone and the iPod touch .
It allows group chats and conference calls and is tightly integrated with Apple ’s Address Book .
As an aside , I wonder how long before special WiFi-enabled Skype phones go the way of the dodo , now that Skype has got mobile religion .
John Lingan :
We 've been asked , both by the blogging chorus and the Daily Show host himself , to recognize Jon Stewart 's recent interview with Jim Cramer as a legitimate cultural - political event , but I think this could conceivably be seen as Stewart 's jumping - the - shark moment some time down the road .
I 'm a fan of Stewart and The Daily Show ( even though I 've sensed a certain growing frat - boyish broadness in the show 's comedy over the last year or so ) , but he 's reached a point of cultural saturation and influence that 's making it harder and harder for me to accept his continued " We 're just entertainers ! " mantra whenever a debate gets heated .
And with Cramer , I see him going after low - hanging fruit , on his extraordinarily comfortable home turf , and puffing out his chest a little too much given the circumstances .
Stewart 's program is most purposeful and urgent when he 's satirizing the media rather than politicians , so his hostility towards CNBC in light of recent economic events is a great move .
But his focus on Cramer gives more credit to this stooge than seems appropriate .
Here 's a guy whose job is to bang gongs and scream into the camera while soothsaying about dividends and downturns ; Cramer , too , is a mixture of entertainer and political commentator , only his network has chosen to work his image from the opposite angle as Stewart's .
He 's advertised ( " In Cramer We Trust " ) as an oracle but people watch because he 's a clown .
But unlike Ta - Nehisi Coates , who ultimately indicted American viewers for indulging Cramer in the first place — asking , " Why is there a market for foolishness ? "
— I can't possibly think of Cramer 's success as so individualistically pure .
He 's got a schtick , and his mondo - corporate overlords fund it and advertise it because that kind of thing sells .
And really , it sells because of ground paved by Stewart , who 's got a much more creative , societally useful schtick , but who still makes his money by producing a pseudo - current events show and packing it with fun little bells and whistles that excite his core demographic(s ) .
So his attack of Cramer seems disingenuous , particularly when he does it in front of his own fawning audience rather than on the road like when he taunted Tucker Carlson and Paul Begala on Crossfire .
I simply can't give him credit ( or accept the interview 's tone of gravitas ) for mocking a guy whose very appeal is his shock - jock buffoonery .
Had Stewart done some kind of man- on - the - street comedic thing going after the goons at CNBC who deified and legitimized Cramer to boost ratings , then that might have been something .
But Stewart 's acting ( and many media types have slavishly agreed ) like this showdown is somehow bigger than one improbably influential TV personality getting in some easy licks on another .
Andrew Sargus Klein :
I can get on your “ Stewart is jumping the shark ” boat , though I ’d equivocate and say that he ’s overgrown his role — as in , he still has much more to offer the public at large — than taken a turn toward irrelevancy .
But note the show in question ’s opening segment , full of hey - look - at - this - “ serious ” - guy - arguing - with - this - “ unserious ” - guy humor : Stewart , if anything , is very much aware of the image you ’ve described , John .
He is an entertainer , and he knowingly retreats behind that title .
But going over the unedited interview — with plenty of “ fucks ” coming from Stewart — there was , undeniably , anger in his voice and in his demeanor and in his composure .
A deep , slow burning anger that speaks of a child ’s empty college account , or a mother ’s disappearing retirement fund — while a hero for the stoned collegiate and intellectual blogger set , Stewart tapped into that red- blooded American gene : populism .
And he did it well .
And it can be said , I think , without apologizing for Stewart ’s flirting with both sides of the entertainer - journalist divide , that something had to be said .
At the least , a chunk of the public is aware of CNBC ’s terrible record of commentary and analysis , or that Jim Cramer really is a windbag and should be treated as such .
The mainstream news media , shamed after being sold the jerry - rigged sandcastle that is the Iraq War , now has a drinking buddy in the mainstream business media , which was just as startled as all the Joe Six - Packs out there .
Cramer represents the most superficial fringe of the business media ( and Stewart makes a point of not wanting Cramer to be the face of his criticism ) , but he is a part of it nonetheless .
I think of the interview as an anomaly ; no , it ’s not out of character for Stewart , but , just like Cramer , he ’ll be back to business as usual .
This whole affair will truly be a jump - the - shark moment if Stewart decides he must bring his truth to power every night in such a fashion so as to have it both ways : he can attack , as a smart satirical commentator , and not be attacked because he ’s an entertainer .
John :
The combination of Stewart 's mock - epic opening credits ( " Brawl Street : Get Ready to Buy Low and Sell Die " ) and stern populism is exactly my point .
You ’re right , Andrew , that it 's pretty clear from the interview that Stewart 's got real , audience - approved reasons for taking Cramer to task , but he preemptively defends himself from fatal ( for a comedian ) self - seriousness by pretending his interview 's really no big deal ; it 's just some underwhelming story USA Today cooked up for its front page .
And like I 've said , this is disingenuous .
I guess where you and I disagree is the extent to which lambasting Jim Cramer represents " speaking truth to power . "
That takes bravery , whereas Stewart 's interview required nothing of the sort .
Were he to have Cramer 's CNBC bosses on and grill them about the power they 've given him , then he'd have , in my opinion , some small justification for his populist rancor .
But Tucker Carlson is right : CNBC did n't cause this recession , and Cramer certainly did n't .
Carlson also correctly calls Stewart a " sacred cow , " which can be seen in the effusive reaction to his acknowledged ratings stunt .
It 's a completely no -risk decision to have a known windbag come on your show and foist blame upon him for a crisis he did n't create , and Cramer gets the assist for his Michael Steele - worthy tap dance of apology and shame .
But Carlson 's an interesting example : his show got canned mere months after Stewart tore it to shreds , and CNN even admitted Stewart 's criticism was a main cause .
A victory for our new , 21st - century Edward R. Murrow , right ?
But no one could possibly say that any serious reform has happened in cable news — that the average volume of these screaming - match shows has decreased or the funding for them declined .
Instead , CNN reacted to a public belittling and the uncool guy lost his job , while Stewart got hosannas for his criticism .
Indeed , the man 's media satire is worthwhile and necessary , but if he just keeps attacking these on - air personalities and winning out because his reach ( particularly with young people , the advertising holy grail ) is greater than theirs , then this strikes me less as taking on the establishment and more like a celebrity popularity contest .
Andrew :
One quibble .
I wrote “ his truth to power , ” and I should have emphasized the “ his ” — meaning his own brand of faux - journalism .
But to look at your hypothetical for a moment :
Do you actually think the CEOs of NBC would have gone on Stewart ’s show ?
I very much doubt they ’d even bother with a response .
You correctly noted that Cramer and Stewart are close inverses of each other : the former is an entertainer sold as an expert , the other a smart journalist sold as an entertainer .
With this interview , that parallel is pretty damningly exposed — and I really do think that ’s the point , that Stewart could expose Cramer ( who , let ’s not forget , does receive a lot of traffic despite how buffoonish you and I have always thought he is ) as being on the same level as Stewart , not vice versa .
No , network commentary has n’t gotten any better since Stewart knocked those Crossfire fools around on live television .
But I do n’t see that episode or this current one as part of a zero - sum game .
Stewart comes out on top — perhaps not a lot , but enough — because he was able to manipulate that divide between the commentator and the clown and score one for the network - hating , hack - loathing , somewhat - sensible public .
It ’s not an approach that can last forever , as we ’re seeing in real time , but at least it ’s doing something .
Stewart ’s foundational appeal is his satire , which , in order to be good , has grains of truth .
This time around , though , the satire was n’t in Stewart ’s delivery , it was in the very premise of his show .
The truth is still there .
Now , what would happen if this has been between Cramer and Steven Colbert ?
Can water replace fossil fuels in our cars ?
Â Japanese company Genepax says it can , and claims to have done it .
Â
The water powered car can run on any source of water , including salt water , rainwater , tea , or soda .
Â
By using electrolysis , hydrogen is separated from the oxygen in water ( H 2 O ) and used to power the car .
According to Genepax :
The car can run for an hour at about 50 miles per hourÂ on just a liter of water ; about 2 cans of soda worth .
As long as a bottle of water is on hand , that is how long the car will run …Unlike other electric cars , the Genepax car does not require that batteries be recharged and has no emission .
The water electrical generator is located in the back of the car and when water is poured it is then broken down in order to create electricity to power the car .
However , the idea of water being a legitimate source of fuel is a topic of much controversy and debate .
Professor Theodosios Korakianitis at Queen Mary University of London disputes Genepax ’s claim of powering a car with just water , “ Because water is not a fuel , it ’s impossible to do that unless you bring energy from an external source to split the water . ”
Â
He believes that the next generation of cars will be fueled with a combination of second generation biofuels and hydrogen .
Despite scientific skepticism , water powered car enthusiasts believe they will become reality .
Â
In fact , this is not new technology .
Â
The first water powered car was invented in 1805 by Isaac de Rivaz ( patented on January 30 , 1807 ) .
Â
Even though his design may not have been successful , it demonstrates that hydrogen derived from water has been considered a fuel source for cars ever since the internal combustion engine was invented .
[ Editor ’s Note : Since we first researched this story , the text on the homepage of Genepax ’s website has changed to inform visitors that the company has closed their website , stating : “ We have yet to overcome the many obstacles we face in the current world , to bring our systems to market …
Moreover , the costs of development have become very large .
As our resources are very limited , we need to retrench and reassess our resources and our development plans at this time …
Â Â Personally , we are still trying to figure out how Genepax got Jason from Friday the 13th to drive the demo car in the above photo … ]
Activity in the hippocampus was monitored Scientists say for the first time they have understood someone 's thoughts by looking at what their brain is doing .
The hippocampus is widely known to be integral to memory , but researchers say they now see just how images are stored and recalled in this part of the brain .
Wellcome Trust scientists trained four participants to recognise several virtual reality environments .
Discernible patterns in brain activity then signalled where they were , they wrote in the journal Current Biology .
It would be very easy not to co-operate , and then it would n't work
Demis Hassabis
Researcher Neurons in the hippocampus , also known as " place cells " , activate when we move around to tell us where we are .
The team , based at University College London , then used specialised scanning equipment which measures changes in blood flow in the brain .
This allowed them to examine the activity of these cells as the participants - all young men with experience of playing videogames - moved around the virtual reality environment .
The data was then passed through a computer .
" We asked whether we could see any interesting patterns in the neural activity that could tell us what the participants were thinking , or in this case where they were , " said Professor Eleanor Maguire .
Are you lying ?
" Surprisingly , just by looking at the brain data we could predict exactly where they were in the virtual reality environment .
In other words we could ' read ' their spatial memories . "
" By looking at activity over tens of thousands of neurons , we can see that there must be a functional structure - a pattern - to how these memories are encoded . "
But they stressed that the prospect of genuinely reading someone 's most intimate thoughts - or working out if they were lying - was still a long way off .
Their participants were all willing subjects who allowed their brains to be trained and monitoring to take place .
" It would be very easy not to co-operate , and then it would n't work , " said Demis Hassabis , who developed the computer programme to read the data .
" These kind of scenarios would require a great technological leap . "
Participants were asked to navigate between virtual reality rooms
It is brain diseases such as Alzheimer 's which could stand to benefit from such research .
" Understanding how we learn and store memories could aid our understanding of conditions in which memory is compromised and potentially help patients in the rehabilitation process , " said Professor Maguire .
Professor Clive Ballard , director of research at the Alzheimer 's Society , said : " This exciting development will boost our understanding of the hippocampus , a key area affected in Alzheimer 's disease and the most important part of the brain for memory .
" Learning more about how the brain works could help us work out which types of nerve cells are lost in Alzheimer 's . "
Rebecca Wood , of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , said the research was " fascinating " .
She said : " Understanding how memories are formed may help researchers discover how this process goes wrong in diseases like Alzheimer 's . "

More than 600 self - professed climate skeptics are meeting in a Times Square hotel this week to challenge what has become a broad scientific and political consensus : that without big changes in energy choices , humans will dangerously heat up the planet .
The three - day International Conference on Climate Change  organized by the Heartland Institute , a nonprofit group seeking deregulation and unfettered markets  brings together political figures , conservative campaigners , scientists , an Apollo astronaut and the president of the Czech Republic , Vaclav Klaus .
Organizers say the discussions , which began Sunday , are intended to counter the Obama administration and Democratic lawmakers , who have vowed to tackle global warming with legislation requiring cuts in the greenhouse gases that scientists have linked to rising temperatures .
But two years after the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded with near certainty that most of the recent warming was a result of human influences , global warming ’s skeptics are showing signs of internal rifts and weakening support .
A quarter of families make use of grandparents for childcare each week Grandparents who care for grandchildren should be paid tax credits and given " granny leave " if they work , a charity report has said .
Grandparents
Plus says grandparents are playing an increasing role by caring for children and supporting parents .
And a survey for the charity found four out of 10 parents were likely to seek more help during the economic downturn .
Children 's Minister Beverley Hughes said government research suggested most grandparents did not want to be paid .
Family support
The report said parents who were able to return to work because of childcare by grandparents should be able to claim tax credits .
Grandparents in work should have two weeks ' " granny leave " in the child 's first year , it added .
The report called for employers to ensure they extended flexible working practices to grandparents .
It is time to recognise the contribution grandparents make

Grandparent with the parents ' role
And it said working grandparents providing childcare should get credit towards their National Insurance in the same way that parents , foster carers and carers of disabled adults will be able to from April 2010 .
Grandparents
Plus chief executive Sam Smethers said : " We believe that the existing policy focus on the nuclear family means we miss what is really going on .
" In the tough economic climate it is families who are taking the hit .
Grandparents are playing an ever - increasing role in supporting family life and caring for children but their contribution often goes unrecognised . "
' Undervalued role '
The YouGov survey for Grandparents Plus of more than 2,000 people found 61 % of those polled agreed that grandparents should be paid by the government for providing childcare .
Three - quarters said that grandparents of working age who provide childcare should get credit towards their state pension .

More from BBC Radio 5 live Some 55 % said that grandparents should have the right to request flexible working in the same way as parents who have children aged under six .
The figure for those who were more likely to turn to grandparents to help with childcare in the current economic climate rose to 55 % for parents aged 18 - 34 .
Ms Smethers said : " Our poll shows that the general public appreciates the important role that grandparents play but most people do not think the government values this highly enough .
It is time to recognise the contribution grandparents make . "
' Informal arrangements '
Ms Hughes will launch the Rethinking Family Life report at the House of Commons on Wednesday .
She said the government recognised the " valuable role " grandparents played in providing childcare but that intervention in informal family arrangements " would be going too far " .
" We would not wish to disturb family arrangements by encouraging charging between family members who would not otherwise have done so , " she said .
" And we believe that many people using relatives for childcare would not welcome such interference either .
GRANDPARENTS IN THE UK 14 million in total 3 in 10 grandparents are of working age Grandparental childcare is worth £ 3.9bn 1 in 4 families use grandparental childcare each week 1 in 2 single parents rely on grandparental childcare Source : Grandparents Plus " Research shows that , in general , most grandparents do not want to be paid for the care they provide . "
Shadow families minister Maria Miller said : " Gordon Brown keeps telling us that the state has more of a role to play in helping people through the recession but this report clearly shows that it is often families that we turn to first for support and guidance during tough times .
" Grandparents often play a critical role in providing the flexible childcare , emotional support and financial help that families need . "
Saga 's editor - at - large Emma Soames said the magazine welcomed the report .
She said : " Many parents , particularly younger single parents , are highly dependent on grandparents for childcare and financial support .
" The government needs to support grandparents who provide unpaid childcare for their families .
" Where grandparents are foregoing the right to work and suffering financially to support their families it seems fair and right that their role should be acknowledged . "

After a ton of guesswork and rumors flying around , Microsoft has finally confirmed what much of the evidence was pointing to : there will indeed be six editions of Windows 7 , just like there were for Windows XP and Windows Vista .
Customers will be able to choose from Windows 7 Starter Edition , Windows 7 Home Basic Edition , Windows 7 Home Premium Edition , Windows 7 Professional Edition , Windows 7 Ultimate Edition , and Windows 7 Enterprise Edition .
The news comes hot on the heels of the Windows 7 Ecosystem Readiness Program announced yesterday .
All editions will be available in worldwide markets except for Home Basic , which will be offered in emerging markets .
Starter will be also available worldwide but only via OEMs .
" We know emerging markets have unique needs and we will offer Windows 7 Home Basic , only in emerging markets , for customers looking for an entry - point Windows experience on a full - size value PC , " Mike Ybarra , General Manager for Windows said .
" We ’ll also continue to offer Windows Starter edition , which will only be offered pre-installed by an OEM .
Windows Starter edition will now be available worldwide .
This edition is available only in the OEM channel on new PCs limited to specific types of hardware . "
Most users will only use Home Premium , Professional , and Ultimate , which is why Microsoft is expected to only offer upgrade paths for these three .
Here is how the different versions differ from each other :
Windows 7 Starter ( worldwide via OEM only ) : up to three concurrent applications , ability to join a Home Group , improved taskbar and JumpLists
Windows 7 Home Basic ( emerging markets ) : unlimited applications , live thumbnail previews and enhanced visual experience , advanced networking support ( ad - hoc wireless networks and Internet connection sharing ) , and Mobility Center
Windows 7 Home Premium ( worldwide ) : Aero Glass and advanced windows navigation , improved media format support , enhancements to Windows Media Center and media streaming , including Play To , multi- touch and improved handwriting recognition
Windows 7 Professional ( worldwide ) : ability to join a managed network with Domain Join , data protection with advanced network backup and Encrypting File System , and print to the right printer at home or work with Location Aware Printing
Windows 7 Ultimate ( worldwide ) : BitLocker data protection on internal and external drives , DirectAccess for seamless connectivity to corporate networks based on Windows Server 2008 R2 , BranchCache support when on networks based on Windows Server 2008 R2 , and lock unauthorized software from running with AppLocker
Windows 7 Enterprise ( volume licenses ) : same as Ultimate , includes the following improvements : DirectAccess , BranchCache , Search , BitLocker , AppLocker , Virtualization Enhancements , Management , as well as Compatibility and Deployment .
We were n't crazy about the proliferation of Vista versions , so we have mixed feelings this time around .
The Vista version differentiation is essentially a cash grab , and the same is true with Windows 7 .
We had hoped that with the new version , Microsoft might be a little less egregiously money - grabbing .
That said , the Windows 7 line - up does address some of the problems with the Vista line - up .
Vista 's delineation between versions simply did n't make a lot of sense .
It assumed computers were used far more narrowly than is actually the case , and put the consumer in the unfortunate position of having to choose —
" Do I go for remote desktop and shadow copies , or do I go for Media Center ? " — or buy the considerably more expensive Ultimate edition .
The Windows 7 line - up fixes that major problem ; by making pricier versions true supersets of cheaper versions , the decision making is a lot simpler .
No longer is it necessary to make a choice between unrelated features .
The reinstatement of the Professional branding ( instead of Vista 's Business brand ) also provides a useful join - up with the familiar XP branding .
The relegation of Home Basic to emerging markets should also mean that — in first world markets , at least — the proliferation of versions is n't so immediately apparent .
In conjunction with the cleaner segmentation , the choice betwen Home Premium , Professional , and Ultimate is now much clearer .
Whether consumers were ever really confused by the different Vista versions is hard to say , but either way the problem should be greatly reduced in Windows 7 .
On the other hand , the decision to make the crippled Starter edition available worldwide is quite extraordinary ; the appeal even in emerging markets is unclear , and since even netbooks are more than up to the challenge of running Home Premium , the purpose of this is completely unclear .
Many commentators have suggested that there should be a dedicated netbook edition , but even if one buys into that idea ( we do n't ) , Starter edition ai n't it .
The new SKUs are certainly an improvement over the Vista ones , and for that we should be grateful .
It is gratifying that Microsoft has listened to the criticism of Vista 's versions and taken at least some of it on board .
It 's still disappointing that the company still feels the need to so openly maximize its revenue ; this is not behavior that breeds goodwill .
A reversion to the XP launch line - up of Home and Professional would be far more palatable .
Windows 7 's version line - up is certainly a step forward — but what we were really hoping for was an even bigger step backward .
My brother is a shoe store DJ .
My father is a shoe store DJ .
My grandfather was a shoe store DJ .
The day I left the trade , some in my family cursed me .
But now I ’m having the last laugh .
I went down to the union hall ( Local # 1215 ) yesterday , where my father and brother shoot pool and wait — in vain — for work .
“ I knew there was trouble when Adidas laid off their daytime DJ , ” Dad ’s colleague DJ Whizzy tells me .
“ I mean , sure , we knew that the double - deck days at the Camper Store were over , but nobody thought it would get this bad . "
" Tell him about the fuckin’ iPods , ” my brother Mastertrakkz shouts from across the room .
“ Tell him about how store managers think they can replace flesh and blood DJs with some bullshit playlist filled with nothing but old Daft Punk . ”
My brother does n’t address me directly .
He wo n’t talk to me anymore — not since I refused to cover a gig for him once at NikeTown Glendale .
I just could n’t do it .
I had gotten off a joyless shift at Puma Outlet , took a look at the turntable in the back seat of my Suzuki Samurai , and realized it was n’t the life for me .
Shoe store DJing just is n’t in my blood .
When my father heard I had taken off the giant headphones for good , his reaction was more muted .
“ Time was , a man could n’t buy a pair of loafers without some sort of modern musical accompaniment .
Nowadays , people do n’t seem to care .
They go in , come out with new sneakers , and hardly seem to miss the Diplo / MIA remix record I would have played for them .
Heck , boy , you could never beat match worth a lick anyhow , could you ? , ” my father teases .
“ I remember when you tried to scratch solo over Portishead .
To this day , that Onitsuka Tiger store wo n’t return my phone calls , ” he chuckles .
Some still hold out hope : union leaders praised President Obama ’s proposed $ 140 million aid package for the beleaguered industry ; he also closed a Nafta loophole that allowed undercutting Mexican DJs to work the tables in certain states .
Some decry the measures as rank protectionism , but old - time practitioners of the craft , like my dad , are just happy for the chance to spin another day .

She says ' neigh ' to hay !
Meet Pandora - the horse that 's allergic to grass
Shrouded in what looks like an ill - fitting Christmas jumper and leg warmers , she cuts a comical figure .
But the plight of Pandora the mare is no laughing matter .
The five - year - old thoroughbred has to be kept covered up because she is allergic to grass .
Wrapped up in her protective clothing and safely protected from the grass to which she is allergic , Pandora has a carefree canter around the paddock
Even a single blade touching her coat is enough to leave her gasping for breath and covered in large , painful boils .
Her owner , Emily Pearce , has no option but to cover her up with a protective layer of high - tech polyester - based breathable fabric to avoid having to lock her away for her own safety .
She also wears a mask to protect her eyes .
She is fed a special mixture of sugarbeet chaff and soya oil , along with 15 anti-histamine tablets a day .
Owner Emily Pearce , right , has to protect Pandora from grass which can leave her gasping for breath and covered in painful boils
' She does look silly but it is the only thing that helps her , ' said Miss Pearce , 24 , from Henley - on - Thames , Oxfordshire .
Pandora's £ 185 rug , imported from a specialist firm in Sweden , is usually used to protect a horse from insect bites .
It is designed so that it can be buckled around her but leave her moving freely .
The mask , which costs £ 50 , fits snugly over her ears and down to her muzzle and is held in place with Velcro .
Although it covers her eyes , it is so fine she can see through it .
Miss Pearce , an auxiliary veterinary nurse , bought the 15.2 - hand horse for £ 2,600 in 2007 .
Last summer Pandora began to develop a large , itchy lump on her belly at her stables in High Wycombe , Buckinghamshire .
The lump continued to grow and when it was joined by others , Miss Pearce tried steroid injections but they did nothing to relieve Pandora 's distress .
In the end , a battery of tests was carried out , revealing she was allergic to every type of grass .
Stretched thin in Afghanistan and Iraq , the American military will begin recruiting skilled immigrants who are living in this country with temporary visas , offering them the chance to become United States citizens in as little as six months .
Immigrants who are permanent residents , with documents commonly known as green cards , have long been eligible to enlist .
But the new effort , for the first time since the Vietnam War , will open the armed forces to temporary immigrants if they have lived in the United States for a minimum of two years , according to military officials familiar with the plan .
Recruiters expect that the temporary immigrants will have more education , foreign language skills and professional expertise than many Americans who enlist , helping the military to fill shortages in medical care , language interpretation and field intelligence analysis .
“ The American Army finds itself in a lot of different countries where cultural awareness is critical , ” said Lt. Gen. Benjamin C. Freakley , the top recruitment officer for the Army , which is leading the pilot program .
“ There will be some very talented folks in this group . ”
BEHIND THE STORY
Manuel Menezes
Morais shot the photos , but he was sworn to secrecy about the cars ’ location and the owner ’s name .
However , he was able to obtain permission from the elusive owner to give me the following information :
The owner of the cars was a car dealer in the 1970s and 1980s , and decided to save the more interesting cars that came through his doors .
When the barn was full , he padlocked and “ soldered ” the doors shut .
( Perhaps welding was too permanent . )
Web sites varied on the number of cars : 58 , 100 , and 180 were speculated .
According to Morais , there are 180 cars in the barn .
And , aw shucks , none of the cars is for sale .
Clara was able to determine that the cars are located somewhere in the area of Sintra , near Lisbon .
I asked Morais if he could ask the owner if he had a favorite car .
“ He has lots of good cars in very good condition , ” he says , “ but he loves the Lancia Aurelia B24 .
He has two . ”
I would ask that a European - based SCM subscriber pick this story up and help fill in the blanks .
And let me know what you find ( tomgcotter@roadrunner.com ) .
I ’d like to include the true story in a future
In the Barn book , as well as in SCM .

How should you do business in a recession ?
Answering that question is the new growth business in the blogosphere .
Naturally , some common themes get voiced with frequency .
And some of those are not good .
Example : John Caddell points out in If Your Key Suppliers are in Trouble , So Are You that the common strategy of stretching out payables has some serious downside effects .
Anyone with payables has to be thinking of stretching out payments .
I do n’t have stats on just how that ’s playing out , but my educated guess is , it ’s pretty common .
Free cash flow on the backs of someone else .
Your suppliers .
It has to look tempting , particularly if you grew up on the mother ’s milk of competitive strategy in the last few decades .
One of the Five Forces of competition , after all , is the competitive dynamic of a company and its competitor - suppliers .
But this ai n’t your father ’s supply chain anymore .
Caddell points out that sticking it to your suppliers just could have downstream consequences in a year or two when the economy rebounds that do n’t look so great .
On one level this is nothing new .
I remember a paper wholesaler explaining to me why supply agreements with paper companies always broke down : “ because the paper cycle lasts 7 years , and the tenure of an individual in that role is 4 years . ”
Self - interest and short - term gain have been the bane of business relationships for a long time .
What ’s different now is that the structure of commerce is fundamentally changing .
The corporate boundaries are porous .
Business is no longer done in vertical , hard - walled entities ; it ’s done across them , in the white spaces and the contracts between and among companies .
The action is not in internal collaboration and external competition , it is in collaboration across corporate lines .
Collaboration is the new competition .
Which is why I noticed two things lately .
One client suggested to me that they were cutting my rates because “ times are tough and we ’ve all got to share the pain . ”
It clearly was n’t meant as a way to keep their consultants happy ; it was a way to gain advantage over them in a tough time .
That ticked me off .
Another client suggested they were having to cut back on my business — but they were very welcoming of other ideas , and never suggested issues with rates .
That made me like them .
I think that ’s just how people work .
If they keep you but try to gain advantage , that stinks .
If they fire you but apologize for having to do it , you do n’t feel so bad .
One you want to work with again , and one you do n’t .
That ’s the thing about tough times .
The people that treat you well when it counts are the ones who earn your loyalty .
This is not a recession : this is the down - half of a business cycle .
How you behave now determines the profit impact of the up - cycle .
Is your business model to make money by squeezing your partners when they ’re down ?
Or is your business model to make money by having committed partners when times are up ?
You ’d think that would be a no - brainer .

* U.S. federal cigarette tax jumps by $ 1.01 on April 1
* Experts think million smokers will quit because of cost
* Industry sees 10 percent sales drop , 117,000 lost jobs
WASHINGTON , March 15 ( Reuters ) - A big hike in the federal tax on cigarettes taking effect on April 1 may prompt 1 million U.S. smokers to quit , according to public health experts .
Expansion of a popular public health insurance program for lower income children is being financed by an increase in the federal excise tax on a pack of cigarettes of about $ 1.01 per pack , up from the current 39 cents on a $ 4.35 pack .
Smoking kills about 440,000 Americans annually and costs the nation $ 193 billion in medical expenses and lost productivity , said Dr. Terry Pechacek of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’s Office on Smoking and Health .
“ There is almost unanimous agreement across the scientific community and policymakers that raising the price of cigarettes in whatever fashion has a consistent effect on reducing smoking rates , increasing the quit rate among adult smokers and preventing the initiation of regular smoking by children and young adults , ” Pechacek said in a telephone interview .
Danny McGoldrick , the Campaign for Tobacco - Free Kids advocacy group ’s vice president for research , said the formula is simple : as prices rise , fewer people buy cigarettes .
McGoldrick forecast the tax hike will persuade just over 1 million current smokers to quit and prevent 2 million children from starting .
These changes will avert about 905,000 smoking - related deaths and save $ 44.5 billion in healthcare expenses over time , McGoldrick predicted .
President Barack Obama signed the expansion of the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program on Feb .
4 . President George W. Bush had twice vetoed the bill , which also raises federal taxes on cigars and other tobacco products .
The industry is unhappy .
Higher prices will lead to at least a 10 percent decline in cigarette sales and could put 117,000 people out of work , said Thomas Briant , executive director of the National Association of Tobacco Outlets .
LOST JOBS
Briant , whose group represents the operators of 2,500 retail stores , tobacco wholesalers , cigarette manufacturers and others , decried “ the single largest tax increase on a product in the history of the United States . ”
“ There ’s going to be an immediate drop - off in sales because of that tax increase as of April 1 , ” Briant said .
“ We expect the fall - out from that in terms of job losses to take about six to nine months from that date . ”
Retail store clerks and cashiers , truck drivers who deliver cigarettes , warehouse workers , sales representatives and others may lose jobs , Briant said .
U.S. smoking rates have been declining slowly for decades .
The CDC ’s most recent data showed about 19.8 percent of U.S. adults -- 43.4 million people -- were smokers in 2007 .
Smoking rates vary by state -- from a high of 28 percent in Kentucky to a low of 12 percent in Utah .
Rates are often higher where state tobacco taxes are lower .
The average state tax is $ 1.32 per pack , ranging from a low of 7 cents in South Carolina to a high of $ 2.75 in New York state .
State taxes have more than doubled in the past six years and more states and localities are banning smoking from public places like office buildings , restaurants and bars .
Daniel Smith , president of the American Cancer Society ’s Cancer Action Network , said the next important step is for Congress to give the U.S. Food and Drug Administration power to regulate tobacco products .
The FDA already oversees drugs , medical devices , most foods , cosmetics and animal drugs .
A House of Representatives panel approved the long - stalled measure on March 4 .
It still needs passage by the full House and Senate .
“ This is the year to make it happen , ” Smith said .

Untold millions of men have probably pondered the question of why female Republican candidates are usually so much hotter than their Democratic counterparts .
Well , I have certainly wondered about this same thing myself , so I decided to write up a blog post sharing my thoughts on this perplexing and wondrously titillating subject .
The thing is , we all know that there are a lot of incredibly attractive liberal women out there .
We might not agree with their politics , but there is no denying their womanly charms .
And considering the fact that according to the polls American women more are more likely to be democrats , regardless of age , it makes sense that there are a great number of gorgeous left wing women out there .
The question is why , with a few exceptions , these good looking left leaning women are staying out of politics ?
After all , the Democrats are always talking about equal rights , and gender equality , so that would make you think that there would be more democratic stunners running for office !
Perhaps the answer is that in the Democrats attempt to remain “ PC ” ( gag ) they do n’t like to be seen as “ shallow ” , so they resist the urge to promote or encourage attractive young females who could potentially be groomed for office .
Its common knowledge that Republicans ( especially Trump ) understand marketing and branding much better , so that would explain the greater number of easy - on - the - eyes women on the GOP side of the universe .
As the evening swallowed New Hampshire last week I reclined on a couch and watched about four hours of sublime reality TV , all focused on the grotesquely fat .
Outside the cold wind blew and a deep blackness covered the pines , but inside it was warm and cheerful and I had kindled a nice fire in the fireplace and swaddled myself in wool sweaters .
Everything was numbing and pleasant .
In December , New Hampshire suffered a colossal power outage .
My parents lost electricity for much of the week before Christmas and I enjoyed frequent cell phone updates of their trials ( by the time I came to visit for the holidays power had been restored ) .
We spent the holiday and post - holiday portions of my visit emerging into the state ’s signature icy cold only to go shopping ; we were not alone in this pursuit .
Borders and Barnes and Noble teemed , Costco thronged , shoppers crowded even Macy ’s ( in Bedford , NH , the Macy ’s usually languishes in sad emptiness ) .
The news media reported a slack and disappointing retail season , but it did n’t look so bad from the ground .
After the dark deprivation of the power outage the citizens of New Hampshire seemed willing to spend , chafing some heat back into their frozen limbs through the magic of discount smoked trout and bulk merino wool socks .
I followed this metaphorical orgy of consumption with a heaping helping of obesity - based reality TV , several interwoven programs on TLC : Half Ton Dad , Half Ton Teen , etc .
The fat shows followed the standard basic - cable format for hour - long programs — plenty of commercials , and each short segment began with a time - wasting recap of what was going on in the program .
The shows followed various hugely fat people through their invariably unsuccessful efforts to lose weight .
Half Ton Teen particularly dramatizes the family suffering .
The titular teen , who spent his days in heart - breaking indolence in a tiny room sprawled on a crushed and deformed easy chair , suffered terribly from his grotesque body .
He was too fat to go to school , too fat to move around without pain , certainly too fat to date .
His mother , who had lost a previous child after only nine months , wanted to give her grossly fat son all the enjoyment that her dead infant had missed .
She expressed this mostly through food , gross food , sandwiches drenched in mustard , heaps of French fries , melted cheese .
She brought these meals in to her son and he rested them atop his swollen belly and ate them slowly and methodically , his pudgy fingers dragging the fries through ketchup , his labored breathing loud over the TV speakers .
His mother alternated feeding her son with screaming at him for his unhealthy weight and eventually his family brought him to an obesity clinic ( an ordeal not without its own humiliations ) .
The clinic ’s staff consulted with the family and promised the half - ton teen that if he dedicated himself he would be able to lose enough weight to regain a normal life .
His mother , who was distraught and confused and crying , seized upon this good news and told him through her tears , “ Do you hear that ?
You can do anything !
You could be President some day ! ”
This was heartbreaking — her son , though polite and keenly self - aware , was clearly not presidential material .
I suppose that the woman was using “ You could be President ! ” in its ancient , American metaphorical sense , in the belief that in our great country , free of the stifling social strata of Europe , anyone can be anything .
This family had broken itself on the reefs of consumption , but they still felt hope that they could survive and return to normal , whatever that means in America .
Their search for a cure , of course , was another form of consumption , the heavily mediated consumption of medical procedures and services .
I have no idea where the money came from for the half - ton teen ’s obesity treatment , but the show portrayed his multiple surgeries ( to remove fat from his legs and abdomen ) and physical therapies .
His mother , tragically , intruded into his rehab sessions , interfering with the physical therapist and restricting her son ’s already pitiful exercises .
This was a family tragedy ; a very intimate drama that consumed one small group of people but also put them in contact with a huge corps of paid professionals .
I was thinking of this one family as I read through two extensive websites listing the horrors of dealing with customers .
These websites , notalwaysright.com and customerssuck.com , are absorbing and often incredibly funny .
Told from the perspectives of retail employees , the two sites collect stories of cruel , stupid , and almost invariably rude customers .
There are hundreds of these tales , each one uniting embarrassment , horror , and sometimes the satisfaction of seeing a boor get his or her comeuppance .
In these tales , customers routinely make patently unreasonable demands : changing or predicting the weather , providing products that do n’t exist ( in one memorable exchange a customer asks for waterproof , open - toed , comfortable hiking sandals with a high heel ) , and frequent requests for telepathic diagnosis of computer or personal problems .
Obviously the stories from these sites are particularly lurid or ludicrous , but they nonetheless reveal the quiet horror of working in retail .
I have never worked retail — the closest I came to that was a job at a stable during high school in which I dealt mostly with horses .
Horses have their problems but they generally did not expect me to give them free merchandise and they never insulted my intelligence .
These websites have given me a great deal of sympathy for the minimum - wage employees who stand between consumers and the gigantic corporations that provide us with most of the stuff we love to buy .
The overarching theme of these stories is an odious sense of entitlement .
Most of the stories come from America , and a great number of them feature customers shrieking “ Do n’t you know the customer is always right ? ” as if it were a sufficient and complete explanation for why an employee of Home Depot should mow the customer ’s lawn .
Shoppers , by virtue of their supposedly superior position as customers , seem to believe that the employees of the stores owe them something .
The relationship hinges on the idea that because the customers might spend money and are assumed to have money that they are a fundamentally different class of person .
By now it is a cliché to diagnose America with a consumer sickness , and surely this sickness does not confine itself to America .
Recently we have seen the drama of high gas prices , foundering automobile companies and Byzantine financial schemes and their associated bailouts .
For a brief time the thrilling , consumption - based idea of fuel - efficient cars looked like it would dominate the American automotive industry , but we ’re already seeing reports that this has exceeded the national attention span and that , with gas prices low again , everyone would like to go back to titanic SUVs .
After this holiday season , one that took shape in the public mind more as a retail failure than anything else , I ’ve been thinking about the shopping , and the obesity , and the boundless everyday cruelty of customers and salespeople , and the proliferation of reality TV and various other media that promise glimpses into the lives of the super - rich .
Consumption !
Over the holidays I bought no less than four merino wool sweaters .
Help !
WASHINGTON / NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc and a parade of European banks were the major beneficiaries of $ 93 billion in payments from AIG -- more than half of the U.S. taxpayer money spent to rescue the massive insurer .
The revelation on Sunday by American International Group Inc was another potential public relations nightmare , coming on the same weekend that the Obama administration expressed outrage over AIG ’s plan to pay massive bonuses to the people in the very division that destroyed the company by issuing billions of dollars in derivatives insuring risky assets .
The size of the payments also illustrates how seriously a potential collapse of AIG was viewed by the regulatory authorities .
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said in an interview with CBS news magazine “ 60 Minutes ” that the failure of AIG would have brought down the financial system .
AIG , an embattled insurance giant that has received federal bailouts totaling $ 173 billion and is now paying $ 165 million in employee bonuses , is at the heart of a global financial crisis that President Barack Obama is trying to address with plans for trillions of dollars in spending .
As part of those efforts , Obama will announce steps on Monday to make it easier for small business owners to borrow money , officials said .
But the revelations that billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars were funneled through AIG to Goldman Sachs -- one of Wall Street ’s most politically connected firms -- and to European banks including Deutsche Bank , France ’s Societe Generale and the UK ’s Barclays could stoke further outrage at the entire U.S. bank bailout .
FINANCIAL SYSTEM AT STAKE ?
The fact that billions of dollars given to prop up giant insurer AIG were then transferred to European banks and Wall Street investment houses could raise new doubts about whether the rescue was really economically necessary .
“ It does n’t to me seem fair that the American taxpayer has got to bear the 100 percent of the downside , ” said Campbell Harvey , a finance professor at Duke University .
“ A hedge is not a hedge if you did not factor in the counterparty risk .
And the U.S. taxpayer should not be obligated to make people whole for hedges that were not properly executed . ”
Goldman Sachs , formerly led by Henry Paulson who was treasury secretary at the time of the original AIG bailout , said , as it has in the past , that its AIG positions were “ collateralized and hedged . ”
Deutsche Bank and Barclays declined to comment .
Societe Generale was not available for comment .
As it seeks to ease the credit crunch that was the original target of the Troubled Assets Relief Program ( TARP ) , the Treasury will also offer more details this week about the workings of proposed public - private partnerships to take toxic assets off banks ’ books , including a timeframe , a senior department official said on Saturday .
“ No taxpayer in these arrangements is going to lose money until the investor who put up the money has lost 100 percent , ” said Chief White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers .
Treasury officials have said the fund , or funds , would be a vehicle to provide as much as $ 1 trillion in financing for buying bad assets -- particularly mortgages gone bad as a result of the U.S. housing bust .
The Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp would participate .
STILL INCOMPLETE
As more Americans lose their jobs and homes , Obama ’s new administration is under heavy pressure to show that the rescue plan for AIG and major banks is working to free up lending and rein in the riskier excesses of Wall Street .
The payments to AIG counterparties include the provision of collateral to back up credit default swaps , a form of financial insurance that AIG ’s London office was writing ; the purchase of the collateralized debt obligations , a type of complex debt security that underlay that insurance ; and payments to counterparties of a securities lending program .
Through three separate types of transactions , Goldman received an aggregate $ 12.9 billion .
Among European banks , SocGen was the biggest recipient at $ 11.9 billion , Deutsche got $ 11.8 billion and Barclays was paid $ 8.5 billion .
The AIG disclosures are still incomplete in that they do not include payments to the banks since December 31 .
The list of counterparties was made public by AIG amid growing pressure on the insurer to come clean about the true beneficiaries of the bailout ahead of a congressional hearing on Wednesday at which AIG chief executive Edward Liddy is slated to testify .

Democratic Congressman Paul Kanjorski , whose committee will quiz Liddy , said the counterparties and bonuses would both be topics for investigation at the hearing .
Summers -- speaking before the payments to banks were made public -- called the AIG bonuses “ outrageous ” but said contracts must be honored , even though Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner had “ negotiated very forcefully ” with AIG and done all that was “ legally permissible ” to limit the payments .
“ We ’re not a country where contacts just get abrogated willy nilly , ” Summers , a former treasury secretary , said on CBS ’s “ Face the Nation ” program .
“ What the lesson is , is this :
We do n’t really have a satisfactory regulatory regime in place . ”
HELP FOR BIG AND SMALL
To help small businesses , officials said Obama intends to provide $ 730 million from the congressionally approved $ 787 billion economic stimulus program to cut lending fees , boost loan guarantees and expand other programs .
“ We know that small businesses are the engine of growth , ” Christina Romer , who chairs the White House Council of Economic Advisers , said on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press . ”
“ We absolutely want to do things to help them . ”
As part of the financial rescue , the Obama administration expects private investors to bolster government funds to help cleanse the banking system of bad assets , said Austan Goolsbee , a member of the Council of Economic Advisers .
“ It ’s better to do this jointly with private capital , ” Goolsbee told “ Fox News Sunday . ”
“ I believe there is a reasonable expectation that people will participate . ”
The idea of offering financing support from the government for private investors willing to buy the toxic assets was first put forward by Geithner in February but the lack of detail has disappointed financial markets .
CHECKING AIG CONTRACTS
AIG ’s Liddy said in a letter to Geithner the giant insurer was legally obligated to make 2008 employee retention payments but had agreed to revamp its system for future bonuses after the Obama administration objected .
“ There are a lot of terrible things that have happened in the last 18 months , but what ’s happened at AIG is the most outrageous , ” Summers said .
Representative Barney Frank , the Democratic chairman of the powerful House of Representatives Financial Services Committee , said the government must see if the bonuses can be recovered , adding that the timing of AIG ’s commitment was important .
“ We ca n’t just violate law , legal obligations , ” Frank told Fox .
“ I understand that .
But I do want to find out at what point these illegal obligations were incurred . ”
Mitch McConnell , the Republican minority leader in the Senate , called the AIG situation an “ outrage ” and said the nature of the contracts needed to be checked .
While the news that AIG bailout money went to foreign banks could further stoke political outrage , some experts said the alternative could have been worse .
“ The nationality of the bank should not matter , ” said Peter Morici , professor at the Smith School of Business , University of Maryland .
“ We have an inter - related financial system .
You do something to mess with that and all bets are off the table . ”
The Federal Government has struck a deal with the major banks to help people who have lost their job and are struggling to pay the mortgage .
The Australian Bankers Association 's David Bell says the Commonwealth , NAB , Westpac and ANZ banks will postpone home loan repayments for up to 12 months for people in hardship .
" We 've recently agreed with the Government to a series of expanded options to help our customers if they experience financial hardship through unemployment or other circumstances , " he said .
Mr Bell says other measures which the banks will consider include extending loan contracts , reducing repayments or waiving fees .
" Each will be individually tailored for the particular customer , but they could be extending the period of the contract on the loan , " he said .
" It could be reducing the limits available to customers on credit contracts and it could include repayment holidays , but it's up to the individual circumstances of the customer . "
Interest - only repayment options may be available on other types of loans .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd is expected to release more details about the package at a forum in Melbourne today .
Mr Rudd has arrived back in Australia after a two - week overseas visit to the United States and Britain for the G20 summit .

At least 20 people have been killed during a riot at a prison in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juarez , say police sources .
Officials said many other people were injured as prisoners fought with knives and set fire to cell blocks .
Rival drugs gangs have been battling for control of Ciudad Juarez , where more than 2,000 people have been killed over the past year .
The government has already deployed more than 1,500 troops in the city .
Chihuahua state police spokesman Carlos Gonzalez told the Associated Press news agency that a fight broke out between three different gangs in the early hours of the morning .
An unnamed police official told AFP that 20 people had been stabbed or beaten to death .
Television footage showed brown smoke coming from the windows of the prison buildings as helicopters hovered overhead .
Several people could also be seen on the roof of the facility .
Soldiers and police wearing riot gear later regained control of the prison , located in the desert outside the city .
' Deeply worried ' Mexico hopes to deploy 7,000 soldiers to tackle violence in the city Ciudad Juarez is a key entry point for drug smuggling into the US and has become a centre of gang warfare .
Chief of police Roberto Orduna stepped down last week amid threats against his officers .
Criminal gangs had threatened to kill at least one police officer every two days until he resigned .
Earlier , 1,500 soldiers were moved into the city and Mexican officials say they intend to have 7,000 military personnel and police in position in the city by the end of the week .
Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora said the situation in the city was deeply worrying and the troops were there in support of the local authorities .
The US has said it is prepared to help Mexico in its battle against drugs cartels .
US Defense Secretary Robert Gates said such aid could take the form of military hardware , training and intelligence support to tackle what he said was " a serious problem " .

We 're constantly told that taxes do n't matter to business and investors , but listen to that noted supply - side economist , Alec Baldwin .
The actor recently rebuked New York Governor David Paterson for threatening to try to help close the state 's $ 7 billion budget deficit by canceling a 35 % tax credit for films shot in the Big Apple .
" I'm telling you right now , " Mr. Baldwin declared , " if these tax breaks are not reinstated into the budget , film production in this town is going to collapse , and television is going to collapse and it's all going to go to California . "
Well , well .
Apparently taxes do matter , at least when it comes to filming " 30 Rock " in Manhattan .
Believe it or not , Mr. Baldwin 's views are shared across the movie industry , which is pleading in state capitals across the country for most - favored - tax status .
Hollywood productions are highly mobile and can film just about anywhere .
So they have taken to shopping around the country -- and the world -- for the most lucrative tax avoidance deal .
According to the Motion Picture Association of America , nearly 40 states have corporate tax carve outs or generous cash rebates to lure movie studios to their states .
In Michigan , producers negotiated a 40 % tax credit on their production costs .
A bipartisan bill introduced in the Texas legislature last week and supported by Governor Rick Perry would allocate $ 60 million into the Texas Film Incentive Program .
Members of the Screen Actors Guild held a rally last week in front of the state capitol urging the tax breaks .
In some cases these state tax credits exceed a company 's tax liabilities , which means that Disney , Dreamworks and others can get a net cash subsidy from state taxpayers .
" In many states , today , movie producers actually pay a negative tax , " says a Tax Foundation report on the subject .
More on : Economic Crises
So writes Martin Wolf .
And despite some signs of hope this morning , he is certainly right .
The IMF ’s latest global forecast leaves no doubt on this point .
The IMF should be commended for dropping its usually measured language when circumstances , unfortunately , call for candid , vigorous prose .
The IMF ’s note for the G - 20 :
" The prolonged financial crisis has battered global activity beyond what was previously anticipated .
Global GDP is estimated to have fallen by an unprecedented 5 % in the fourth quarter ( annualized ) , led by the advanced economies , which contracted by 7 % .
GDP declined by around 6 % in both the United States and Europe , while it plummeted at a post - war record of 13 % in Japan .
Growth also plunged across a broad swath of emerging economies ... against this backdrop , global activity is expected to contract in 2009 for the first time in 60 years . " ( emphasis added )
Both the IMF and World Bank are now forecasting an outright fall in global output in 2009 , with a larger contraction than previously forecast in the advanced economies and sharply lower expected growth in the emerging world .
I am not sure that even Nouriel Roubini was forecasting an outright fall in global output a year ago .
Anything below 2 % is generally considered a global recession .
The most visible manifestation of the scale of the downturn continues to come from Asia -- with the sharp fall in Asian exports to the world mirroring the sharp fall in global demand .
Japan ’s exports are now down 50 % from last February .
The IMF is now forecasting a 6 % of GDP contraction in Japan in 2009 .
That is a contraction of magnitude as emerging economies experience during their crises .
While growth is expected to be stronger in many parts of Asia than in Japan ( India and China are expected to be able to find domestic sources of growth ) , the trade data does n’t alas , look at that different .
The pace of decline in Korea and Taiwan ’s exports did moderate in February , but at least some of that was a by product of the timing of China ’s new year .
That though offers the only glimmer of hope in the Asian trade data .
The y/y fall in China and Japan still has n’t hit bottom .
Much of the expansion of global trade over the last decade -- like much of the expansion in cross - border financial flows -- rested on a weak foundation .
It required an unsustainably high level of consumption in the US -- and , at the tail end of the boom , a bit of a consumption bubble in the UK , Spain and a host of new European economies as well .
And rather than adjusting gradually , the adjustment is coming far too quickly .
One last point : the IMF ’s analysis ( see appendix 1 , and pp. 27-32 ) of the size of different countries fiscal stimulus is interesting .
China ’s discretionary fiscal stimulus is among the largest .
But it has weak automatic stabilizers .
Consequently , the inclusion of automatic stabilizers increases the size of Europe ’s fiscal policy response , but not China’s .
If the size of the fiscal stimulus is measured by the swing in the government ’s fiscal balance from 2007 to 2009 , China ’s effort looks a bit less impressive than say the United States effort .
It is roughly comparable to Europe ’s effort .
The IMF forecasts a 4.8 % of GDP rise in the US fiscal deficit ( using their definition of the deficit , which excludes financial bailout costs ) , a 4.4 % rise in the deficit of the European members of the G - 20 and a 4.5 % swing in China ’s deficit .
Or to put it a bit more provocatively , big external deficit countries like the US and the UK are going to run fiscal deficits of between 8 and 10 % of their GDPs , while the deficit in surplus countries like China and Germany remains between 3 and 4 % of their GDPs .
The change in the fiscal balance does n’t though capture China ’s efforts to use its state banks to support local state - led infrastructure spending , or for that matter the Fed ’s efforts to use its balance sheet to support consumer lending in the US .
All in all , fiscal policy clearly is being used to support global growth , as it should be .
The fall in exports globally in February leaves no doubt that there is an enormous shortfall of demand , relative to the world ’s capacity to produce .
But the global decomposition of the stimulus does n’t suggest that it will do much to support " rebalancing . "
The surplus counties generally are n’t leading the stimulus league tables .
Last week Nettuts ’ editor Jeffrey posted about a new screencast competition .
This is n’t my entry – it ’s just a test - runner to see if I ’m any good at the whole screencast thing .
It ’s a 30 - minute screencast about event delegation in jQuery and in it I explain event bubbling / propagation and then go on to demonstrate how to develop an event delegation plugin for jQuery .
Note :
The quality is n’t too great but if you make it full screen it ’s much better !
Thanks for watching , if you have any feedback I ’d love to hear it !
I ’m planning on recording my entry for that competition soon , it ’ll also be on jQuery although I ’m not sure of the exact topic yet …
Here ’s the plugin we created in the screencast :
$. fn . delegate = function ( selector , event , action ) { return this [ event .
replace ( / ^on/ , '' ) ] ( function ( e ) { var target = e ?
e. target : window .
event .
srcElement , elements = $ ( selector , this ) , elementsLength = elements .
length ; elementLoop : while ( elementsLength -- ) { var parents = $ ( target ) .
parents ( ) , parentsLength = parents .
length ; parentLoop : for ( var pi = 0 ; pi < parentsLength ; pi ++ ) { if ( $ ( parents [ pi ] ) . is ( selector ) ) { return action .
call ( elements [ elementsLength ] ) ; } } if ( elements [ elementsLength ] === target ) { return action .
call ( elements [ elementsLength ] ) ; } } return true ; //
We do n't want to prevent default action so returning true is best } ) ; } // USAGE EXAMPLE : $ ( 'ul ' ) . delegate ( ' li ' , ' click ' , function ( ) { $ ( this ) . parent ( ) . append ( $ ( this ) . clone ( ) ) ; } ) ;

Public Health Emergency declared , but travel is still wide open
( Natural News )
The swine flu / bird flu / human flu virus ( H1N1 ) has now been confirmed as striking victims in New York City , Kansas , Ohio , Canada and is suspected in New Zealand , Spain and Israel .
Over 100 people are now confirmed dead from the swine flu ( mostly in Mexico City ) , and confirmed infectious have surpassed 1600 .
Just today , the U.S. declared aover swine flu .
There is considerable speculation that the infection numbers are vastly underreported , especially by authorities in Mexico who are attempting to reduce the economic loss associated with international trade and travel restrictions erected in the aftermath of an infectious disease outbreak .
( See related story on NaturalNews : https://www.naturalnews.com/026141.html
As world health authorities have openly admitted , swine flu is way beyond containment .
This virus .
So much for the first line of defense against infectious disease , huh ?
The second line of defense is the government 's much - touted " anti-virals " like Tamiflu ( oseltamivir ) which are actually weak pharmaceuticals that offer no immunity and are available in such small quantities that far fewer than five percent of the people in most countries will even have access to such medicines .
For the most part , such medicines are being made available solely to health care workers , not to the population at large .
Even then , reports are already emerging that health care workers in Mexico City who were vaccinated have died within days ( https://www.naturalnews.com/026141.html ) .
It is not known whether they also took anti-viral medications .
It seems quite clear that if this swine flu strain becomes widespread , the people of the world will mostly have to fend for themselves .
Government availability of H1N1 vaccines is currently zero , and availability of anti-viral oral medications is strictly limited .
People who wish to purchase or make their own natural anti-viral medicines can tune in to thethis Thursday evening .
Details at : http://www.truthpublishing.com/Swine_Flu_the...
There is already speculation that this swine flu strain may have been .
While NaturalNews does not yet agree with this assessment , this is without question a possibility that needs to be considered .
There is already some evidence that the H1N1 genetic code has somehow been assembled from three species ( bids , pigs and humans ) spanning three different continents .
The " natural " occurrence of such a combination seems extremely remote , although not impossible .
I 've covered the conspiracy theory / bioweapon issue with H1N1 swine flu in a related article here on NaturalNews : https://www.naturalnews.com/026141.html
I just returned from Taiwan yesterday , and in passing through U.S. immigration and customs in L.A. , I noticed no special efforts to screen travelers for fever or infectious disease .
This stands in stark contrast to Taiwan , which is far more vigilant on the matter , hosting a " quarantine zone " with an infra-red camera through which all arriving international passengers must walk .
The idea is to catch passengers with fevers using the infra-red camera , they enter the country and infect more people .
( It 's sort of a smart idea ... ) The U.S. has no such protections in place that I saw ( I was looking for them ) , and it was more than a bit disturbing to take an eleven - hour flight across the Pacific Ocean with numerous passengers coughing and sneezing the whole way .
For all I know , I may have already been infected with the swine flu , although I show no symptoms for any such infection .
The point in all this is that .
Conspiracy theorists might even say the U.S. isthe spread of the virus , although I think it 's more likely just incompetence on the part of immigration officials who are slow to respond to this issue .
Or maybe they 've already realized , since infections have now been confirmed across multiple U.S. states .
I can't speak for the Dept. of Homeland Security ( nor would I want to ) , but if I were really interested in security , I would at least erect infection screening facilities at entry points in major U.S. airports .
At the very least , you could use an infra-red temperature " gun " to zap people 's temperatures as they 're walking in .
Those with high temperatures could be asked to step aside to at least record their travel history and future travel plans in the U.S. -- information that would be invaluable to CDC officials trying to track the spread of infections .
Note , by the way , that if you get infected with H1N1 , U.S. health care and law enforcement officials canthanks to new laws passed by the Bush Administration .
This makes sense on one level , of course , as a way to protect the rest of the nation 's citizens from carriers of deadly disease .
But it also means that the minute you step into an airport , train station , bus station or other public place , you may be placing your freedom at risk by merelyMy advice to Natural News readers ?
If you 're sick ( from anything , the sniffles , coughing , sneezing , etc. ) , STAY HOME .
Do n't go to work .
Do n't go to school .
And certainly do n't travel .
If you do , you may find yourself riding out your sniffles in a high - security quarantine zone , courtesy of the U.S. government .
Have fun with that one !
( Just try to get some anti-viral tinctures in there ! )
This story continues with part two : https://www.naturalnews.com/026141.html ) .
It focuses on the conspiracy theories discussing the possible man-made origins of H1N1 swine flu .

Stress ' Unravels ' Brain Structure - Study
The helpless behavior that is commonly linked to depression and post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) is preceded by stress - related losses of synapses — microscopic connections between brain cells — in the brain ’s hippocampal region , researchers at Yale School of Medicine report in Biological Psychiatry .
The team used a six - day treatment with the antidepressant desipramine to reverse helpless behavior and restore hippocampal synapses in rats .
“ In clinical practice , the main problem with antidepressants is that they require weeks to exert their effect , ” said lead scientist on the project Tibor Hajszan , M.D. , associate research scientist in the Department of Obstetrics , Gynecology & Reproductive Sciences at Yale School of Medicine .
“ Because there are ways to restore these lost hippocampal synapses in as little as hours or even minutes , our laboratory is currently testing rapid - acting antidepressants that could provide immediate relief from depressive symptoms . ”
Mental health disorders , including depression , are rapidly becoming the second largest public health problem , said Hajszan .
“ This is magnified by the fact that current antidepressant drugs remain ineffective in the majority of patients , ” he said .
Researchers have suspected for years that changes in synapses may play a role in depression neurobiology .
In this study , Hajszan and his team studied helpless behavior in rats and used electron microscopy to analyze directly what happens to hippocampal synapses in the presence or absence of helpless behavior .
“ Because synapses have the potential for rapid response , synapse loss probably underlies the rapid deterioration of mood that depressed patients sometimes experience , ” said Hajszan .
“ Thus , it is possible to elevate mood rapidly by generating new hippocampal synapses , which is attainable by certain drugs we are testing . ”
Other authors on the study included Antonia Dow , Jennifer L. Warner - Schmidt , Klara Szigeti-Buck , Nermin L. Sallam , Arpad Parducz , Csaba Leranth and Ronald S. Duman .
This defies words and dreams .

E.D. Kain sums up neoconservatism :
The Islamic world is nothing like the Western world .
We have few , if any , of the same values and virtually no historical commonality save our shared , centuries - old conflict with one another .
The Islamic world , by and large , has none of the laws or customs necessary to develop an organic democratic society the way Western nations have .
Therefore , the only way to achieve peace with the Islamic world is for them to adopt our notions of plurality , democracy , and humanism .
They wo n’t do this on their own because of their lack of shared values , and so it follows that we must intervene on their behalf to impose these values , and fashion democracies for them in our image .
But not in Egypt or Saudi Arabia or Gaza ( where an actual free election that gave Hamas power was rewarded by a blockade ! ) .
And then we patiently listened as neocons told us that the Palestinians are too dysfunctional a people ever to have democratic rights or their own state , but that the the ancient sectarian warfare of Iraq can be transformed in a few years !
As Kain remarks :
One would think the fallacy here too apparent , and yet it has shaped much of our foreign policy in regards to the region for the past three decades .
I took neoconservatism seriously for a long time , because it offered an interesting critique of what 's wrong with the Middle East , and seemed to have the only coherent strategic answer to the savagery of 9/11 .
I now realize that the answer - the permanent occupation of Iraq - was absurdly utopian and only made feasible by exploiting the psychic trauma of that dreadful day .
The closer you examine it , the clearer it is that neoconservatism , in large part , is simply about enabling the most irredentist elements in Israel and sustaining a permanent war against anyone or any country who disagrees with the Israeli right .
That 's the conclusion I 've been forced to these last few years .
And to insist that America adopt exactly the same constant - war - as - survival that Israelis have been slowly forced into .
Cheney saw America as Netanyahu sees Israel : a country built for permanent war and the " tough , mean , dirty , nasty business " of waging it ( with a few war crimes to keep the enemy on their toes ) .
But America is not Israel .
America might support Israel , might have a special relationship with Israel .
But America is not Israel .
And once that distinction is made , much of the neoconservative ideology collapses .

BALTIMORE , Feb. 8 ( UPI ) --
The NAACP will begin a yearlong celebration this week of its 100th anniversary , the U.S. civil rights group said .
The organization , with headquarters in Baltimore , was formed by a multiracial group of activists in 1909 as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People .
It was formed Feb. 12 , 1909 , to coincide with the 100th anniversary of President Abraham Lincoln 's birthday .

Its centennial comes less than a month after the nation 's first black president , Barack Obama , was inaugurated , the Pittsburgh Post - Gazette noted Sunday .
" The dear Lord plans all things .
All I know it 's great this is the 100th anniversary of the NAACP and one of those colored people is the head of our country , " said civil rights activist Alma Fox of Stanton Heights , Pa .
NAACP chapters in more than 1,200 communities will begin a yearlong celebration Thursday of the milestone anniversary .
The organization said it would recommit to its mission to " ensure the political , educational , social and economic equality of rights of all persons and to eliminate racial hatred and racial discrimination . "
NAACP President Ben Jealous said in a statement that while the group has made great progress during the past 100 years , " our journey remains unfinished . "
The initial RPS response to Legends of Zork , the just - released free ( ish ) browser reimagining of the old text - based adventure / RPGs , was that it ’s simply too wretched and cynical to merit a post .
Instead of ignoring it though , I ’m going to pen a sort of open letter as to what ’s wrong with it and what needs fixing to to rescue the fun concept underneath all the howling screw - ups .
Why should I bother ?
I guess I ’m a little saddened that a game - name of legend has been treated so cursorily .
I ’ve barely played the original Zork , but nonetheless this just seems like a bizarre waste of a license .
Crucially , though , I reckon it can be fixed ( this being web - based and free from expensive graphical shenanigans , it only needs theoretically cheap code - tweaks ) .
Here ’s how .
Gosh , I ’m arrogant .
That fun concept is , essentially , a turn - based , text - based RPG – along the lines of the boardgame Talisman , or more recently the wonderful Kingdom of Loathing ( which really deserves its own post here at some point ) .
You explore , you fight stuff , you loot stuff , and you buy stuff : the core enjoyment factors behind so many RPGs .
Sometimes watching a bunch of numbers slowly get bigger is enough , to paraphrase Gillen .
Unfortunately , here it ’s not – primarily because the numbers are n’t represented as anything but numbers .
Why does the game go to the trouble of having you choose an avatar and buy a bunch of loot with funny - ish names if you then do n’t get to see any of it ?
Given so much of the loot is pretty prescribed – as in , most people are going to end up with the same stuff equipped – it ’s wantonly foolish to have no decent visual representation of both it and how your guy looks with it equipped .
Otherwise you really are just collecting numbers – which is fine for a pen ’n ’ paper RPG , but when it ’s a videogame that already features a ton of environment and creature artwork , it ’s that much harder for the imagination to paint pretty pictures in your mind .
The slow , HTMLy interface hardly helps .
So it ’s this horribly confused halfway house between text - based and graphical adventuring , failing to leverage the strengths of either .
Why do I want to wield a frying pan ?
Because it ’s + 7 to my AR .
Also because it ’s a frying pan !
Hilarious !
Except it ’s not .
It ’s too ordinary a gag – one of the reasons Kingdom of Loathing gets away with similarly rudimentary loot visuals is its item names are openly ludicrous .
You do n’t need much of an image when the words convey a great gag .
A frying pan as a weapon is not a great gag – it ’s just a tired stereotype .
The second core problem ( and like the first it ’s something than could be fixed ) is that Legends of Zork is uncomfortably similar to the RPG - satirising Progress Quest .
I.e. it plays itself .
Combat just happens , as an auto - generated list of stats you have no involvement in .
Looting just happens .
Healing just happens .
Worst of all , the loot you collect sells itself .
A message reading “ you have sold [ all your shit ] for [ this much money ] ” is about as satisfying as paying someone to go skydiving on your behalf then tell you what it ’s like afterwards .
Sure , selling loot is mechanical and repetitive by its very nature , but there ’s a reason it ’s bread and butter to so many RPGs – there ’s a fascination in poring through exactly what you ’ve got , hoping it ’s worth a fortune then feeling proud / annoyed when it is / is n’t .
There is no point in the looting process being there at all if it automatically and magically turns into dry cash .
Make the loot meaningful or usable in some way , or take it out .
It ’s just a waste of silly names as it is .
Finally , there ’s the issue of its free - ness .
You get 30 action points per day – that ’s real , Earth days .
Action points are spent when you fight or travel , which in practice means you ’ll get about 20 fights before waiting until tomorrow or paying ( with real , Earth cash ) for – ugh – ‘ Coconuts ’ that grant you more APs .
Alternatively , there ’s a raft of horrific , spam - addled special offers that bung you a few ‘ nuts if you sign up for them .
Yes , if you subscribe to an online dating site , you get to hit a few more Kobolds .
Think of the stories you ’ll have to tell on your dates , eh ?
It ’s inherently flawed .
There ’s a reason free - to - play games have settled upon a specific model – all the play you want , but with the really cool stuff available as micropayments .
People need to be in the game to want more of the game .
20 minutes a day of clicking one button and watching some numbers go up is n’t going to leave anyone wanting more .
If LoZ ’s payment model is to work , people need to be playing in the first place , then hitting situations in which they want / need something extra .
Better yet , make it good enough to earn critical admiration and a large audience , make it entirely free , then earn revenue from those ads that are all over the site .
I ’m incredulous that ’s not the model it ’s launched with .
Which , really , feeds into all of LoZ ’s major failings .
It ’s transparently designed to earn money first and foremost , and be a game second .
It ’s honestly as though someone designed a micropayment system then awkwardly shoved a very crude game on top of it .
The ethical ambiguity of micropayment systems aside , it ’s something that could work if it ’s slick and compelling enough .
It ’s not – it ’s rudimentary , it ’s unfunny and it ’s horribly cynical .
The vastly superior and totally free Kingdom of Loathing , on the other hand , makes a virtue of the first and is the total opposite of the second and third .
CHICAGO , Feb. 19 ( UPI ) --
A former Chicago journalist and aspiring film producer has sold a television series concept to CBS about the competitive business of organ transplantation .
The Chicago Tribune said Steve Boman shopped around his experiences as a transplant coordinator at the University of Chicago Medical Center , and CBS is casting and shooting a pilot inspired by them for a new , Pittsburgh - set , scripted drama called " Three Rivers . "

Quotation # 37700 from Classic Quotes :
I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies .
If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency , first by inflation , then by deflation , the banks and corporations that will grow up around [ the banks ] will deprive the people of all property until their children wake - up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered .
The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people , to whom it properly belongs .
Thomas Jefferson , ( Attributed )
3rd president of US ( 1743 - 1826 )

An open letter to FOX NEWS .

subject : Could you be any more insulting ?

While this is not the best example of FOX broadcasting deliberately misleading information , it is a perfect example of an attitude which does not just represent what is wrong with your otherwise fine country .
It is literally , exactly & precisely what is wrong with your country .

NEWSWEEK POLL – “ Do you think Saddam Hussein ’s regime in Iraq was directly involved in planning , financing , or carrying out the terrorist attacks of September 11th , 2001 ? ”
2003 response : 47 % Yes , 37 % No , 16 % not sure .
2004 response : 42 % Yes , 44 % No , 14 % not sure .
2007 response : 41 % Yes , 50 % No , 9 % not sure .
Saddam Hussein was not responsible in any way for 9/11 .
The Americans who do n’t know this are the ones who consume FOX NEWS .
Ask a fellow American if they believe Saddam Hussein was involved in 9/11 .
Oh he was ?
Then ask them where they get their news .
I promise you they ’ll answer “ FOX NEWS ” .
Canadians are well aware of this correlation .
The reason USA is bogged down in 2 wars , instead of having won the Afghanistan war and caught Osama Bin Laden already ( with which we continue to help ) is because you , working through your employer FOX NEWS , helped the Bush administration convince your fellow citizens of a lie .
That “ Saddam Hussein was involved in 9/11 ” .
Likely if there had been no FOX NEWS , there ’d have been only one war … the UN sanctioned war .
USA would have won .
And Canadians would n’t be looking south , waiting for the dwindling yet increasingly deranged fans of FOX NEWS to clue in that you do n’t have their best interests at heart .
As an employee of FOX NEWS , do you ever stop to wonder what responsibly you might share for American casualties ?
And those of American allies ?
Should my television cable provider ever offer me a bundle which includes FOX NEWS , my response will be a that they please watch the Red Eye clip , and that any inclusion of FOX NEWS would make such a bundle unacceptable .

WASHINGTON –
The American public supports Israel in its military incursion into Gaza , according to a recent poll conducted by Ipsos .
US Solution US sees Gaza rebuilding as opportunity for Abbas Reuters American , Western officials aim to ensure credit for reconstruction of Strip following Israeli military operation accrues to Palestinian Authority , not to Iranian - backed Hamas Islamists US sees Gaza rebuilding as opportunity for Abbas
Also , 57 % of Americans thought that Hamas had used " excessive " force , whereas 44 % thought that Israel had used " appropriate " force .
Regarding a resolution to the Israel - Palestinian conflict , a surprising number of people were opposed to the two - state solution so often voiced by US leaders .
When asked whether the US should support the establishment of a Palestinian state , 45 % answered negatively while just 31 % answered positively , and 24 % were undecided .
Many also doubted that president - elect Barack Obama would be able to bring peace to Israel .
Just 10 % expressed confidence in Obama 's ability to resolve the conflict , while 32 % were somewhat confident in his capabilities .
A slight majority – 51 % – doubted Obama could implement his famous slogan ( ' Yes we can ' ) on the Gaza conflict .
( Updates with remarks from presidential palace )
PORT OF SPAIN , April 17 ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday greeted and shook hands with Venezuela ’s President Hugo Chavez during an impromptu meeting with the anti-U.S. leader at the Summit of the Americas .
Photographs released by the Venezuelan government showed Chavez , a fierce foe of former President George W. Bush , smiling and clasping hands with Obama at the start of the summit of Latin American and Caribbean leaders in Trinidad .
“ I greeted Bush with this hand eight years ago ; I want to be your friend , ” Chavez told Obama , according to a Venezuelan presidential press office statement .
Chavez , a staunch ally of Cuba , had became one of the Bush ’s administrations most strident critics .
In March , he called Obama at best an “ ignoramus ” after the U.S. leader said Chavez obstructed progress in Latin America .
Ties between Washington and Caracas have frayed under Chavez , who often accuses U.S. officials of trying to topple him .
Chavez expelled the U.S. envoy to Caracas in September in a dispute over U.S. activities in Venezuelan ally Bolivia .
Former soldier Chavez says socialist revolution can counter U.S. free - market policies in South America and he has become a standard - bearer for anti-U.S. sentiment in the region .
But Washington has branded him a threat to regional stability .

The FBI raided a Dallas carrier hotel Thursday and seized equipment from data center space operated by Core IP Networks .
Agents armed with a search warrant appear to have confiscated all the servers in the facility , which houses gear for about 50 businesses .
" The FBI has seized all equipment belonging to our customers , " Matthew Simpson , the CEO of Core IP , said in a message .
" Many customers went to the data center to try and retrieve their equipment , but were threatened with arrest . "
Simpson says the FBI told him it was investigating a customer of Core IP , but claims the company in question is a prior customer that no longer colocates with Core IP .
Simpson told a Dallas TV station that the investigation concerns pirated movies .
That claim has triggered speculation that the probe is tied to the leak of the feature film " Wolverine . "
A rough version of the film is circulating online , several weeks before the movie is scheduled to debut in theaters .
The 6 a.m. raid took place at Core IP 's offices on two floors of 2323 Bryan Street in Dallas , a major carrier hotel owned by Digital Realty Trust .
Simpson said Core IP leases space from Telx , another provider in the facility .
The FBI told Channel 11 News in Dallas that " it could take several days to restore the servers of the affected companies . "
That 's not happy news for customers , which reportedly include numerous phone companies , impacting e911 caller location services in some areas of the country .
FBI officials told the TV station " they could speed up their analysis of the web servers if the affected companies would contact them . "
Simpson said the FBI also showed up at his residence with a search warrant , but said neither he nor Core IP were doing anything illegal .
" If you run a datacenter , please be aware that in our great country , the FBI can come into your place of business at any time and take whatever they want , with no reason , " he wrote .
Obama to release Reagan records kept secret by Bush Muriel Kane
Published : Friday April 10 , 2009
Print This Email This The Obama administration is about to release 244,966 pages of documents from the Reagan White House that the Bush administration had held back for years during a review of whether to assert executive privilege .
Historians and advocates of government transparency have complained strongly about the Bush backlog , which Obama ended with an executive order signed the day after he took office that limits the review period to 30 days in most cases .
In a letter obtained by Politico , White House Counsel Gregory Craig informed the National Archives and Records Administration that President Obama " has not asserting executive privilege over any of this material , " opening the way for their release .
According to a press release from the National Archives , " On Monday , April 13 , 2009 , the Ronald Reagan library will open 244,966 pages of records processed in response to hundreds of Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) requests .
These records include the Presidential Briefing Papers collection , Office of Speechwriting research material and approximately 13,000 pages of declassified records on numerous foreign policy topics . "
Another 797 pages of documents from President George H.W. Bush 's administration on the topic of Saudi Arabia will be released at the same time .
President George W. Bush had held these documents back under an executive order signed on November 1 , 2001 .
According to the New York Times , " The order , drafted by Alberto R. Gonzales , then the White House counsel , gives either an incumbent president or a former president the right to withhold the former president 's papers from the public .
It was issued to block the release of 68,000 pages of records from the Reagan administration , which contain confidential communications between President Ronald Reagan and his advisers , including Mr. Bush 's father , George Bush , who was Reagan 's vice president . "
Former White House Counsel John Dean pointed out at the time , " The Executive Order suggests that President Bush not only does not want Americans to know what he is doing , but he also does not want to worry that historians and others will someday find out .
Certainly that is the implicit message in his new effort to preclude public access to Presidential papers  his , and those of all Presidents since the Reagan - Bush administration . "
It is not yet known what documents are to be released .
However , the fact that both the elder Bush and a representative of Ronald Reagan approved the releases suggests that papers relating to the most controversial issues of their administrations , such as Iran - Contra , will not be included .

The nation ’s home prices continued spiraling downward at a record - setting pace in October , according to a prominent index released Tuesday .
The Standard & Poor ’s / Case - Shiller index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas was down 18 % in October from the same month last year .
The index has now reported 22 straight months of declines , the last 12 of which were record - setting .
“ The only clear statement I can make about the bottom is ‘ Not yet and not too soon , ’ ” said David M. Blitzer , chairman of the index committee at Standard & Poor ’s Corp .
“ All trends indicate we ’re going in the wrong direction .
There ’s no sign it ’s about to bottom out . ”

Existing single - family home prices remain at 2004 levels , and cities that experienced some of the largest housing bubbles during the peak two years ago continue to lead the slide .
Phoenix reported a 32.7 % annual drop in prices from October 2007 , followed by Las Vegas , 31.7 % ; San Francisco , 31 % ; Miami , 29 % ; Los Angeles , 27.9 % ; and San Diego , 26.7 % .
Atlanta ; Charlotte , N.C. ; Detroit ; Minneapolis ; Tampa , Fla . ; and Washington recorded their largest monthly declines .
Prices in the L.A. area , which comprises Los Angeles and Orange counties , dropped a fraction of a percentage point more from September to October than from August to September .

In Los Angeles and Orange counties , lower - priced homes again experienced the steepest declines .
The bottom third of homes -- those priced below $ 351,171 -- dropped 39 % compared with October 2007 .
Midpriced homes ( $ 351,171 to $ 530,387 ) fell 28 % , and the top third of homes ( over $ 530,387 ) dropped 21 % .
The low - priced homes in the area were down 46 % from their peak price in November 2006 , and the highest - priced homes were down 24 % from their peak in June 2006 .
Overall , home prices in the area have declined 34 % compared with their high in September 2006 .
In San Diego , lower - priced homes were down 46 % and high - priced homes fell 26 % from their peak prices in June 2006 .
The area saw a 36 % decline from its ceiling in November 2005 .
Las Vegas fared worse , with prices falling 39 % from their highest month , August 2006 .
Lower - priced homes declined 45 % from their peak in August 2006 , and higher - priced homes in the gambling capital dropped 37 % from their high in May 2006 .

The index compares the latest sales of detached houses with prior sales and considers factors such as remodeling that might change a home ’s sale price over time .
From those data , an index score is created to show price changes .
An index reading of 100 reflects prices in January 2000 .
The October index reading for the Los Angeles area was 179.82 .

GARGOYLE TROUBLES
Loyal Surf Reporter Chris from Boone , NC recently purchased a house and moved into a new neighborhood in Boone , where he 's apparently made quite the first impression .
Obviously concerned that Ugly Southern Stereotypes are beginning to die out , the neighbors have banded together and concluded that Chris and his family are , in fact , smoking on the devil 's johnson .
What follows is the letter received from the homeowner 's association , and Chris 's response .
As hard as it may be to believe , I promise you that I have n't added anything for comedic effect ... this is the real deal .
THE LETTER Christopher and Heather XXXX
XXX XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXX
Boone , NC 28607 Dear Mr. and Mrs. XXXXX
We are writing to you as members of the Evergreen Homeowner ’s Association about a concern that has occupied all our minds since you moved into this neighborhood .
We are a congregate group of good Christian and God fearing people .
The display you have set up on the outer section of your lot has us a bit concerned as the statue appears to be a type of Pagan worshipping symbol , unlike the other lawn decorations in our neighborhood .
Shirley Whitley , a neighbor of yours says that this is a Satanic being and that you may be involved in the Occult .
We have all noticed strange goings on around the neighborhood .
There are flashing lights in the sky and numerous dead animals in the road .
We understand that you are a homeowner , but if you will read your declaration of restrictions , obscene or vulgar displays on your property are not allowed .
We insist that you remove this questionable display at once .
Our children are not to be influenced by Devil worship and deviant behavior .
Ardna Tyne
For the Evergreen Homeowners Association
THE RESPONSE June 16 , 2002 Dear Ardna ( IF that ’s your real name ) , I am addressing the issue of my Gargoyle which the benevolent homeowners association seems to take offense to .
I will NOT be removing my Gargoyle any time soon .
A Gargoyle is an ancient protector of property , and can be seen all over Europe in the architectural structure .
I guess the homeowners association has n’t gotten to them yet .
My Gargoyle basically looks like a puppy with wings .
Does this frighten you ?
I can only imagine you screaming in fear when the Snuggles fabric softener bear is speaking to you through your evil television set .
I would like to file a formal complaint about several yards in the neighborhood .
The guy down at 152 has grass that ’s over two feet tall .
What ’s he growing in there ?
The woman at 138 has a saddle and stirrups decorating her mailbox .
What is that all about ?
I , for one , am not a cowboy , do not like cowboys and find it horrifying how the cowboys treated the Indians and Tom Landry .
That guy was the only coach they ever had .
Once they fired him , he died .
Was that fair ?
I find cowboys to be highly offensive .
Do n’t get me started on the pink flamingos in the Whitley yard .
As for the flashes of light in the sky , that ’s lightning , you idiot .
Have you noticed at about the same time the wicked sky lights are flashing , there are evil drops of liquid falling from the sky ?
We are in a drought .
I would think rain would make you thankful .
As far as the dead animals go , you idiots do n’t know how to drive on the winding mountain roads .
That is called ROADKILL .
If you will notice , these are squirrels and rabbits that just walk in front of you as you drive down the mountain with your retired tunnelvisionist eyes glaring straight ahead .
We live at the top of this mountain .
Your friends and neighbors cannot even see my house for all the trees surrounding it , so there is no need for you to freak out over my lawn stuff .
I will not be moving things , so take whatever action you feel is necessary .
See you in hell , Love , Chris XXXXX Chris has promised to keep us updated on any further developments which , I predict , will include torches , pitchforks , and boiling oil in the dead of night .
Stay tuned ...
And , as promised , further developments !
LETTER TWO Christopher and Heather XXXX
XXX XXXXXXXXXXX XXXX:X
Boone , NC 28607
October 25 , 2002
Dear Mr .and Mrs. XXXXX
We are writing to you again , not on the issue of your gargoyle , which you are determined not to remove from display in our neighborhood , but on the issue of your Christmas lights .
Are you aware that it is not yet November ?
You apparently put up Christmas lights the second week of this month and insist on plugging them in nightly .
We can all see your glowing display late into the night over the mountain horizon .
It is keeping several of us awake at night and we do not appreciate such flagrant non-adherence to the Association rules .
Page six of your Homeowner 's Association guidelines specifically states that the neighborhood shall remain seasonal , with holiday displays not to be presented in a period greater than two weeks prior or after said holiday .
Your lights are a distraction to visitors .
An acquaintance who works at Boone Airport has said that your lights are obnoxious and a turn - off to visitors who land at the airport .
If this is an attempt to retaliate against us for the gargoyle incident , we are becoming increasingly annoyed with your behavior .
Legal action may be necessary to either A ) force you to move out of our once peaceful neighborhood or B ) obtain a court ordered fine for your continuing defiance of our rules and regulations .
If you think we will back down on this issue , as we did on the issue of your gargoyle , you are sadly mistaken .
In addition , we are disturbed by the constant removal of trees from your property .
Sunday morning is not a proper time for you to operate your chainsaw .
Our community prides itself on the beautiful forestry that surround our neighborhood and we are determined to stop you from ruining the scenery .
Please leave our trees alone !
Ardna Tyne
For the Evergreen Homeowners Association
RESPONSE TWO November 4 , 2002
Dear Ardna ( I just ca n't believe that is your name ) ,
I AM aware of the date .
If this neighborhood is like the last one I lived in , you will not be putting up lights at all , no matter what the date is .
The last neighborhood , I was the only house on the street to put up lights , as it is Siberian - like weather here in December , perhaps the reason no one puts up lights .
Why do you care that my lights are up ?
Again , I live at the top of the mountain and nobody can even see my house .
If it keeps you awake at night , close your freakin ' windows and quit peering out them like Mrs. Kravitz .
I am not up here for your amusement .
If you want a show , I will be I glad to give you one on New Year ' s Eve , otherwise , QUIT LOOKIN ' MY WAY .
I will not be taking down my lights because of your meek little letter , as it took me 10 days to put them all up .
Page six of the guidelines also is the reference page that my gargoyle fell into .
I am officially tearing page six out of my guidelines and wiping my ass with it .
I will then post it to the tree nearest my mailbox for all your visitors to see .
Feel free to take it down and examine it or use it as evidence against my in your little lawsuit .
Did someone really fly into Boone International Airport ?
Did they really complain about my lights ?
If so , then I obtained my goal .
Someone noticed my lights and I gave the one person who flies into that parking lot something to go home and tell their friends about .
Why did you back off on my gargoyle ?
Did someone tell you your letter to me , coming off as an inbred Christian fanatic was posted all over the internet , and read by many , many people ?
I got more feedback from people I do n't even know telling me to sue YOU for civil rights violations than you would know .
As for the trees I plunked down $ 140,000.00 for this house and the acre of property that goes with it .
These are MY trees , and I could n't give a rat 's ass about what you think about me cutting them down .
Are n't you in church on Sunday Morning , rescuing the world from
gargoyle - bearing heathens ?
The way I see it , this is the BEST time for me to cut down my trees .
There are over 300 trees on my property and I will cut them all down if I wish .
Then you will have a better view of my house , my gargoyle and my feces smeared page six of the Homeowner 's Association rules and regulations nailed to the one tree I will leave standing .
Oh , and I 'm not done putting up lights yet .
Enjoy .
As always , love ,
Chris XXXXX

They 're Farting
The Rocky Stories
The newly - appointed Roman Catholic Archbishop of Westminster , the Most Rev Vincent Nichols , has used his first interview since being named by the Pope last week to denounce plans to permit television advertisements for condoms and birth control clinics .
Nichols , currently Archbishop of Birmingham , told the Press Association that Catholics should publicly oppose the proposals , which are out for consultation before being considered by advertising authorities later this summer .
At present only Channel 4 is allowed to broadcast adverts for condoms , after 7 pm .
He accused a current advertisement warning of the dangers of contracting sexually transmitted diseases through unprotected sex of demeaning young people .
Nichols said : " I doubt that any intended adverts would tell the whole truth of the effects of abortion in a woman 's life .
I seriously wonder if any advertisements for condoms would be tasteful , because the ones we have at the moment are demeaning of the young people .
" They depict casual sex on the street corner and drunken sex .
I do not think these things do anything to genuinely help young people to understand themselves in their own dignity and the proper meaning of what human sexuality is about . "
He added that abortion would no doubt be presented as a simple solution .
But it had traumatic implications in women 's lives .
" Surely you would not expect it to be advertised alongside a packet of crisps . "
The archbishop , who has led a successful campaign against plans to force Catholic schools to take more non-Catholic pupils and an unsuccessful one against the government 's proposal that religiously based adoption agencies should consider placing children with same - sex couples , insisted that he understood the difficulties Catholics faced in living up to the church 's moral teaching .
He said respect was due to everybody , regardless of sexual orientation : " One of the things I regret is that too often in our society a person 's whole identity is shaped by their sexuality , or by their sexual orientation .
In good Catholic eyes a person 's sexual orientation does not matter .
" Where morality comes in is in their behaviour , and we all struggle to behave in accordance with the dignity that God has given us , and there is nothing unusual about a struggle to live a good life , but respect is the first thing .
That is due to everybody . "
Nichols argues in an article in today 's Tablet magazine - taken from a book he has written with the Catholic Conservative MP Edward Leigh - that social cohesiveness depends on the moral framework provided by church schools .
Taking issue with the Thatcherite line that there is no such thing as society , the authors claim : " There will never be a truly cohesive society that does not take seriously the spiritual quest of its people ... and which does not give space in its public culture for religious beliefs .
The rigorously secular liberal project of community cohesion is mistaken in its fundamental view of the human person and simply will not work . "
He told the Press Association : " There is no evidence in this country that faith schools are socially divisive ; they as much as any mix children from different classes , from different ethnic groups , from different cultural groups and in fact are a positive force for social cohesion . "
There are more than 4 million Catholics in England and Wales , though fewer than a quarter attend mass regularly .
A survey of former pupils of Catholic schools in Liverpool , Nichols 's home city , earlier in the decade found that more than 90 % of them ceased their religious observance after leaving education .
Anne Quesney , of Marie Stopes International , said the organisation welcomed the advertising review .
" Just as we teach children how to cross the road safely using advertisements , advertising condoms and pregnancy advice services could work to educate young people to be sexually responsible .
" A discreet advert highlighting where anxious women can access pregnancy counselling and abortion services is not going to demean young people or encourage young girls to become pregnant . "
This weekend a colleague described his frustrations with a software project at his job .
I suggested that he leave a few copies of
The Art of Agile Development ( Powell 's affiliate link ) lying around his office .
In particular , the largest problem I heard in his discussion is that his team has no idea how to release software .
" It 's weird , " he told me .
" You 'd think we 'd stop making the same mistakes over and over again . "
One such problem is rampant and divergent customization .
The project makes an embedded device for sale to OEMs .
They 've based their product on a standard hardware set and use the Linux kernel to drive the hardware and provide a common API for manufacturers to develop their own products .
The hardware and software are both flexible .
A manufacturer can specify a custom set of behaviors , and the hardware and software configuration will enable or disable features from the baseline set of components .
One of the danger signs James Shore wrote about in the Version Control chapter of the Art of Agile Development is rampant branching for customization .
One common and dangerous temptation is to create a branch for each customer , making changes for that particular customer in code .
If you must develop a new feature for that customer , branch the current stable codebase at that point and develop that feature on the branch .
If another customer needs that feature as well , branch from the branch and maintain that branch for the new customer .
Repeat until you have little hope of unifying all of those features and additions again .
( In my experience , that happens the first time you branch from a branch . )
When I first read the draft of Jim 's chapter , I said " I do n't believe in branching . "
Fortunately , he did n't take my advice ( and I 've since repented of that ) .
I do n't believe in long - lived branches .
A branch should be a simple , single - minded , and temporary divergence from trunk .
The goal should always be to merge the branch back into trunk as soon as possible .
Besides the complexity of managing ( and even remembering ) the state of all of these customer branches , my colleague casually mentioned that his team is trying to upgrade from Linux kernel 2.6.23 to the newest version .
Imagine propagating that through the gnarly tree of branches !
If instead , as Jim suggests , customer - specific configuration used a data - driven approach , and if current development always took place on an unambiguous and unified point , the work of upgrading dependencies would be far easier .
It 's the Don't Repeat Yourself principle expressed in terms of your version control system .
( Please note that I have no problem with distributed version control systems , as long as there is a single unification point and a strong community push toward unification .
Tracking and merging changes , especially at the individual level , is very useful .
Rampant and divergent branching is not . )
It was only a matter of time , and it took Thanko to make it happen .

Scientists in Seattle are making a laser gun that can lock on to moving targets .
The laser gun is intended to go after mosquitoes , especially those that are carrying malaria .
About 1 million people die per year from malaria carried by mosquitoes .
It is big problem caused by a small creature .
At this year ’s TED conference , Bill Gates let loose mosquitoes that he carried in a jar .
Gates did this to make a point that many of us are fortunate that we do not live in areas that are of risk .
The laser is called a weapon of mosquito destruction ( WMD ) .
The design was assisted by Lowell Wood , an astrophysicist that worked on the original Strategic Defense Initiative ( SDI ) proposed by Ronal Reagan in 1983 .
And the SDI was also codenamed “ Star Wars . ”
“ We like to think back then we made some contribution to the ending of the cold war , ” stated Dr. Jordin Kare .
“ Now we ’re just trying to make a dent in a war that ’s claimed a lot more lives . ”
The laser detects the audio frequency created by the beating of mosquito wings .
A computer detects the audio and triggers the laser to shoot the mosquito ’s wings off .
The mosquito then plops to the ground and does n’t make it to their prey .
Bill Gates is one of the investors in this project .
Hypothetically , this laser could kill billions of mosquitoes every night .
[ Haskell - cafe ] Thread priority ?
Count me in too I 've got a library that endeavours to deliver ' rate - equivalence ' - i.e there may be some jitter in when the events should have occurred but their long term rate of progress is stable .
Testing has shown that I can get events to occur at the right time within 1ms ( 99 % + of the time , with 50 % + of the events < 0.5 ms ) - choose your O/S carefully though .
And this is without resorting to marking the threads as real time with the kernel .
If it matters you can tune the scheduling to further reduce the timer scheduling latency ( at the cost of more CPU ) and increase the fidelity of event timing another order of magnitude or more .
As for ' garbage collection ruins my real time properties ' argument - I 've been pragmatic about this , you can configure the scheduler to go and perform a GC if it knows that it is going to sleep for a while ( yes , this does n't resolve the issues of external events arriving in that time but read on ) but not perform that too often .
Turning off GHCs timers ( to stop it garbage collecting after it has actually been idle for a while ) and having code that does n't create vast amounts of garbage means that a GC takes < 0.1 ms .
Now if I could see within Haskell the amount of heap that has been recently mutated and some other GC statistics when it was running I could even decide to schedule that more effectively .
We use this to create synthetic network traffic sources and other timing / performance related activities in the wide area context - it serves our needs .

Rove is a ' two - headed rattlesnake ' says former Ala .
Gov. Siegelman David Edwards and Rachel Oswald
Published : Friday March 6 , 2009
Print This Email This Former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman , himself a purported victim of the machinations of Karl Rove , urged Congressional patience when it comes time to interview the former top Bush strategist of his alleged role in the politicalization of the Justice Department .
But his calls to the House Judiciary Committee to take its time in building its case against Rove did n't stop him from calling Rove a " double - headed rattlesnake " in a Thursday phone interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow .
" Karl Rove is like a double - headed rattlesnake , " said Siegelman , a Democrat .
" You have to back him into the corner before you get anything out of him . "
For this reason Siegelman urged that Congress not rush to interrogate Rove now that he has finally agreed to answer questions reports The Washington Post about his role in the 2006 bribery conviction of Siegelman .
" I think that rushing through this is not going to instill faith in the American people that we 've done a good job .
I would encourage Congress to take their time and to look at other people who also can lay the foundation to put Karl Rove in check , " said the former governor , noting that Rove " did n't fire these U.S. attorneys on his own .
He did n't plot the prosecution of Democrats by himself . "
After serving as governor from 1999 to 2003 , Siegelman was found guilty of seven counts of bribery and related charges in 2006 .
He was sentenced to more than seven years in prison but he only served nine months after an appellate judge cited " substantial questions " in his case , reported The Post .
Siegelman urged Congress to subpoena the telephone records and e-mails between Karl Rove and the A.G. of Alabama who launched the bribery investigation .
He also suggested that the e-mails and phone records of Bill Canary , husband of U.S. Attorney Leura Canary , the prosecutor in his case also be subpoenaed .
Siegelman said Canary was Rove 's closest friend in Alabama .
" There are other people in Alabama who have knowledge of this prosecution , " Siegelman said .
" Those people should be brought before the committee and should be asked to tell the truth under oath and under penalty of perjury . "
Raw Story 's own Larisa Alexandrovna's has closely followed the Siegelman case .

One thing we decided to do with libguestfs was to take a particular stand on so - called boilerplate code .
The rule is that we are only going to write something in one place , and everything possible will be generated from there .
To take a specific example , let ’s look at the guestfs_checksum API call .
First , this is what I wrote to implement this :
Link # 1 – click : Implementation of guestfs_checksum command
The important line is near the bottom , where we describe the function :
( " checksum " , ( RString " checksum " , [ String " csumtype " ; String " path " ] ) , ...
In plain English this says that the command checksum returns a string which is the checksum result ( RString " checksum " ) .
And it takes two parameters , the string which is the checksum type , and the string which is the path to the file that we want to operate on .
( Note that although in this case all the parameters are strings , we support many more complex types ) .
From just that one line , we will generate :
The rest of the description includes tests and documentation , from which we will generate tests ( in C ) and documentation in multiple formats including the website .
Link # 2 – click :
Here is the generated code ( which we also check into git because we want people to be able to build without running the generator ) .
Finally , we want the generated code to be readable , so you can trace through it with gdb when there ’s an error .
So the generated code looks like it was written by hand , including helpful comments in many places .
But there is a level of thief even above them , guys who think a little bit bigger than everybody else .
Too big , it turns out .
That 's why they tried to steal things like ...
We think of thieves on a spectrum from the kid who steals a candy bar from 7 - Eleven , to the group of guys in a tuxedos knocking over a casino in an elaborate heist involving grappling hooks .
7 A 3,000 Pound Bell

How often do you go to church ( or in this case , a Buddhist temple ) and , upon hearing the bell think , " I want one ! "
Well , some other guys apparently did , and they decided to make their dream come true .
You can imagine the surprise of the Buddhist monks at a temple in Tacoma , Washington when they noticed their enormous bell was missing .
Especially considering the thing weighted 3,000 fucking pounds .
Experts ( see local police ) theorized that , unless the thieves had some kind of super powers , they would have had to have brought a forklift and a truck to load the thing onto .
With all the quiet time at those temples , you 'd assume someone would have heard something ( it is a freaking bell , after all ) , but nobody heard or saw a thing .

" Well I got this forklift ... might as well use it to steal a big ass bell ... "
The monks said the bell , cast in Vietnam , was so valuable that they could n't calculate its worth , which must have pissed them off even more realizing that the assholes who stole it were probably going to sell it for scrap .
That , of course , raises the question of just what the thieves thought they would do with the thing after they had it , as even the shadiest pawn shops and scrap metal yards would probably give you more than a raised eyebrow as you dragged this bastard through the door .
It turns out they did n't have a plan .
The monks got their bell back a year later , when some dumbass tried to sell it and some other junk for $ 500 .
The buyer went right to the cops , ruining his own chances to have a huge kickass bell on his porch .

S N 2 lab today .
Preparation of ( 2 - methylphenoxy ) acetic acid from o-cresol and sodium chloroacetate .
NaOH deprotonates cresol .
Add sodium chloroacetate and reflux .
S N 2 reaction occurs .
Acidify , collect the precipitate , and recrystallize from water .
Unfortunately , today ’s lab took a really long time .
I ’m not sure why , but it did .
Anyway , I looked around for cool S N 2 demos… and there really are n’t any .
Sure , I can do the Finkelstein at different concentrations and show that one precipitates NaCl faster than another because it is more concentrated .
Woo hoo .
That ’s not very exciting .
So I ultimately decided that today ’s lab just is n’t going to have anything to do with the S N 2 reaction .
I decided to do the upsidedown thunderstorm .
That ’s my name .
I ’ve seen ‘ thunderstorm in a test tube , ’ but that ’s not a very flashy name , now is it ?
Here ’s the deal :
Add a layer of con ’c sulfuric acid to a test tube ( use all proper precautions for handling con’c acid ! ) .
Slowly and carefully add ethanol down the side to create an ethanol / acid biphase ( if you leave it sit too long , the acid and ethanol will mix , so do n’t let that happen ) .
Add a few crystals of finely - ground potassium permanganate .
The reaction occurs , and evolves a gas .
The gas bubbles through the ethanol layer and looks like upsidedown rain .
After a few seconds , “ lightning ” appears at the phase boundary , and the sulfuric layer becomes cloudy and purple ( the storm clouds … ) .
The ‘ storm ’ continues for several minutes .
Manganese waste should probably not be thrown down the drain , so if you do this , dispose of it according to local regulations .
There appears to be a few different processes leading to ‘ lightning ’ formation .
Permanganate is converted to the exposive Mn( VII ) oxide .
Additionally , ozone is created .
The ozone oxidizes the ethanol resulting in combustion of the organic material .
Wikipedia explains :
Concentrated sulfuric acid reacts with KMnO 4 to give Mn 2 O 7 , which can be explosive …
Potassium permanganate and sulfuric acid react to produce some ozone , which has a high oxidizing power and rapidly oxidizes the alcohol , causing it to combust .
As a similar reaction produces explosive Mn 2 O 7 , this should only be attempted with great care .
An approximate equation for the ozone formation is shown below .
6 KMnO 4 ( aq ) + 9 H 2 SO 4 ( aq ) → 6 MnSO 4 ( aq ) + 3 K 2 SO 4 ( aq ) + 9 H 2 O( l ) + 5 O 3 ( g )
When I was practicing the demo , I wanted to see if I could scale it up some to make it more visible than just in a test tube .
I tried it with about 20 mL each of the acid and alcohol in a beaker .
The detonations were sufficiently energetic ( and perhaps the ethanol layer was not tall enough ) that the ethanol caught fire .
I had a cute little ‘ sterno ’ burner going .
For the actual demo , I switched to an Erlenmeyer flask which helped .
No fire this time .
Storm In A Test Tube !
NEW PHILANTROPISTS : Times are tough , not least for fund - raisers , but the president of the Ireland Funds , Kingsley Aikins , reminds SUSAN MCKA Yof the old mantra : Philanthropy is about the three Ts : ‘ time , treasure and talent ’ .
Everyone , he says , can afford to give at least one
‘ OUR GIG IS philanthropy .
People think it ’s a poncey word .
They think it ’s just for fat cats , ” says Kingsley Aikins .
“ But it is n’t .
My favourite definition of it is the kindness of strangers . ”
As president and chief executive of the Worldwide Ireland Funds , Aikins leads an organisation that in the past 10 years alone has distributed more than $ 200 million worth of the kindness of strangers , primarily to voluntary groups , in this country , North and South , and to Irish people elsewhere .
On Monday , he will preside over the Ireland Fund ’s annual Saint Patrick ’s Day Gala Ball in Washington , where Dan Rooney will be honoured .
The 77 - year - old Irish American , the personal benefactor of the Rooney Prize for Irish Literature , founded the Ireland Funds , along with Tony O’Reilly , in 1976 .
Rooney is also celebrated in the US as the owner of the legendary Pittsburgh Steelers football team , six - time champions of the Super Bowl .
“ Dan is an iconic figure , ” says Aikins .
“ He ’s also tipped to be the new ambassador to Ireland . ” Rooney and Aikins have both been given honorary CBE ’s [ Commander of the British Empire ] for their work in the UK and the North .
Rooney backed Barack Obama ’s campaign for the presidency , speaking of the “ great hope ” it gave him .
President Obama has been invited to the ball , but regardless of whether he ’s able to attend , on St Patrick ’s Day itself , the leading figures of Irish America will , as always , Aikins says , “ all troop into the White House ” .
The president will receive his first pot of shamrock , delivered for the first time by Brian Cowen as Taoiseach .
There will be Paddy ’s Day events all over the world , and Ireland Fund events in , among other places , San Francisco , Boston , London , Tokyo and Sydney .
“ No country in the world has a national day celebrated around the globe like Ireland , ” Aikins says .
“ We have a huge global philanthropic network for this country . ”
Aikins talks about the Irish diaspora as “ The Great Irish Empire ” ; some 70 million people , 44 million of them in the US .
The Ireland Funds are active in 39 cities in 11 countries , and 40,000 people take part in their events each year .
But the glitz and glamour of the big day is surrounded for Aikins and his colleagues by a major slog .
He will be two - thirds of the way through a hectic three - week programme of philanthropic and fundraising meetings across the US .
“ By the end of it I ’ll have had 60 one - on - one meetings and I ’ll have seen 2,000 people at events , ” he says .
The Ireland Funds acts as a broker for donors .
“ The big change in recent years is what we call ‘ donor intent ’ .
Donors tell us the sort of project they ’d like to support , they give us a chunk of money and we act as their back office – we facilitate their philanthropy through a product called Donor Advised Funds .
The potential and regular donors he ’s meeting are “ an interesting demographic , ” he says .
“ These are the baby boomers .
They ’ve made a certain amount of wealth , they ’ve raised their family , they are retiring , and they want to give something back .
“ They want to do something with meaning .
We sometimes say that life is about going from struggle to success and success to significance .
Bill Gates talks about the eulogy speech – he asks people to consider their best mate standing over their grave , and to ask themselves :
What do you want him to say ?
That he made a lot of money , or he gave a lot of money to others ? ”
Aikins does a lot of talking as he moves around the world , but does n’t like to talk about himself .
“ This is n’t about me , ” he keeps saying .
Pressed , he gives minimal information and returns eagerly to his main theme .
Asked where he ’s from , he replies : “ Dublin , Ireland , but a long time ago . ”
What was his family like ?
“ Suburban . ”
He does let slip though that his mother was “ big into volunteering ” .
He went to Trinity in 1970 , played a lot of rugby , and then went to France to play some more .
Rugby is a passion in his life .
“ I played for Leinster in 1974 , but only got one game , ” he says .
“ Rugby has opened a lot of wonderful doors for me around the world .
Like many Irish people I had an extraordinary sense of wanderlust .
I worked in marketing for a while and then I joined Córas Tráchtála [ now Enterprise Ireland ] and was sent out in 1985 to run its office in Sydney . ”
While based in Australia , he set up the Australia , New Zealand and Japan Ireland Funds .
“ In 1992 , I was asked would I like to put my name in the hat for the US job , and I got it , ” he says .
Those were glory days for the Ireland Funds .
“ The Clintons were in the White House , we had the peace process and all of that – it was just wonderful , ” says Aikins .
He remembers when former UVF leader , Gusty Spence went to the US , and he laments the loss of another visitor from that time , the Progressive Unionist leader David Ervine , who died two years ago .
“ The unionists came out assuming Irish America was green .
I remember a St Patrick ’s Day dinner that Mo Mowlam called the dinner of the potted plants .
David Trimble was there , and Jeffrey Donaldson , in kilts .
No one wanted to be seen .
They were all hiding behind the foliage .
Now they have such a good time we have to shoo them out .
The relationship fundamentally changed .
Unionists were embraced and engaged by Irish America and that made a huge difference .
Irish America reached out and said , ‘ we ’ll give you a fair hearing . ’
George Mitchell played a big part and Niall O’Dowd and others did good work .
The US broke the logjam . ”
In 1997 , the Ireland Funds provided a grant to bring the leaders of the Northern political parties to South Africa .
“ We did it quietly , ” says Aikins .
“ They would n’t fly together , they would n’t stay together and they would n’t listen to Nelson Mandela together .
Just recently , Jeffrey Donaldson said to me that it was the best $ 25,000 the Ireland Funds ever spent . ”
He says supporters of the US Ireland Fund felt vindicated and justified in their efforts “ for over a generation ” when they hosted a dinner for the then new first minister , Ian Paisley , and deputy first minister , Martin McGuinness , when the pair visited New York and Washington in 2007 .
“ We are also funding something called Divided Cities in Transition , which includes Belfast , Beirut , Jerusalem and Kirkuk .
There ’ll be a meeting in Boston later this year , ” he says .
Northern politicians are also being funded to speak to Iraqi leaders about the Mitchell Principles of non-violence which underlay the NI peace process , known to the Ireland Funds as “ Ireland ’s gift to the world ” .
The integrated education movement has had support from the Funds for years , despite the disapproval of church leaders who prefer the old , segregated system .
“ It still only reaches 6 per cent of kids , ” says Aikins .
“ There ’s a way to go . ”
Not everyone in the diaspora got rich .
Aikins seems particularly proud of a “ new thing ” the Ireland Funds is supporting in the UK : the Forgotten Irish campaign .
This provides funds for the many charities working for the Irish in London – the generation that left this country on the boat for England in the decade after the second World War .
“ These people built the motorways and the London Underground .
They rebuilt towns demolished in the war .
They worked as nurses and domestics .
And they sent three billion pounds home in remittances to Ireland , ” he says .
“ They helped take Ireland out of poverty and they laid the way for the boom .
Now many of them need help .
They should not be forgotten .
We had Peter Sutherland launch the campaign .
Terrific guy . ”
Writer Polly Devlin supplied an eloquent essay on the campaign in the Ireland Funds ’ glossy magazine , Connect .
She describes the pain of emigration for a generation for whom there was no returning .
“ They have literally nowhere to go : and yet emotionally their roots are deep in Ireland , ” she writes .
It is clear from the magazine that life is not too harsh for those whose wealth fuels this sort of work .
There are acres of glossy photos of people out in their finery to enjoy galas , poolside cocktail receptions , balls , garden parties or golf tournaments .
Aikins admits there ’s an element of self - interest for many philanthropists .
“ Ask not what the diaspora can do for you , ask what you can do for the diaspora , ” he says , wryly .
One group is called the Wine Geese Society .
“ These people have a passion for wine , ” says Aikins .
“ We put on these wonderful trips for them .
There ’s a real esprit de corps .
They want travel with learning , authentic learning . ”
There they are , quaffing and supping in beautiful places where grapes grow – but Aikins is in the photos , too , and after dinner you can be sure he ’ll be making a little speech . . .
“ We have a strategy , ” he says .
“ A gift is just a moment in a long - term , hearts and minds relationship .
There are 101 people in the Wine Geese and they ’ve given us $ 30 million . ”
For Aikins , 9/11 was “ chilling ” at a personal level : “ I ’d often taken that United Airlines plane , ” he says .
The Ireland Funds also lost 22 of their supporters , who were killed in the 2001 atrocity .
“ I thought it was the end for us , ” he says .
“ I thought the US would turn inwards .
But a week after it , Dan Rooney held a dinner and the proceeds went to helping out in the aftermath of the disaster .
We clawed ourselves out and the “ Hope and History ” campaign ran for five years , raising more than $ 100 million for Ireland – the best ever . ”
He admits he ’s worried about the implications for philanthropy of the current economic disaster .
“ There has been a massive destruction of wealth .
A lot of donors have been hammered , ” he says .
“ I ’ve been doing a lot of hugging .
People who used to support 10 charities are telling us they are cutting it down to three .
But what we are saying to people is , however rough it is for you , it is a lot rougher for the people you help . ”
There are , he points out , 24,000 not - for - profit organisations in the Republic of Ireland .
There are 7,500 charities .
Some 63,000 people work in the sector and it accounts for 8 per cent of GDP .
Irish non-governmental bodies ( NGOs ) get 60 per cent of their funds from the Government .
“ Is that going to increase or decrease ? ” he asks rhetorically .
“ It is n’t going to increase .
The shrill winds of economic rationalisation are already being felt .
I do a lot of training with NGO boards .
There are going to have to be changes – there ’s a lot of duplication of services , a lot of premises that could be shared , that sort of thing . ”
There ’s also the fact that several of the most significant funds are soon to dry up .
“ Ireland owes Chuck Feeney an enormous debt of gratitude , ” Aikins says .
“ His Atlantic Philanthropies has put $ 1 billion into this country , but he has said he wants it spent in his lifetime .
He says he wants his cheque to the undertaker to bounce .
Guys like that do n’t come on the next bus . ”
It has already become difficult to persuade many US philanthropists that Ireland still needs their money , he says .
Even more so now , when they see needs in downtown Detroit that appear even more pressing .
In 2005 , in an Irish Times interview with Conor O’Clery , Aikins criticised the wealthy of this country .
There were at least 25,000 Irish , resident in Ireland , worth € 5 million or more , he said , and , including property , there were at least 100,000 millionaires .
But whereas in the US , one dollar in every 50 goes to NGOs , there was no tradition of philanthropy here .
Many of the newly wealthy were young and obsessively focused simply on making money .
Meanness , however , is n’t the main issue .
“ Irish people are , for the most part , generous , ” Aikins says .
“ But they tend to use the spray and pray approach to giving .
We are trying to engineer a quantum leap in their thinking , to encourage them to be strategically philanthropic rather than spontaneously charitable . ”
Here , as in the US , there is still plenty of “ quiet wealth ” around , he says : “ It is time for those who can , to step up to the plate . ”
Aikins is back living in Dublin now , with his wife Claire and their three children .
She ’s Irish and they met in the US .
“ We love being back here , but I tell you , the Irish summers are driving us nuts , ” he says .
About his work , he talks like a man well used to talking , and often slips into an after - dinner style , laced with little mantras , the sorts of thing that are liable to stick in the mind the morning after the ball : “ We sometimes say philanthropy is about the three Ts , Time , Treasure and Talent , ” he says .
“ Everyone can give at least one of these . ”
But there ’s a real passion there , too .
This man believes in what he does .
People need to look at philanthropy as an opportunity , he says .
“ They need to think , I could get some real inner joy from this . ”

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Some major financial firms are getting anxious about giving back the billions in U.S. government rescue funds they took hold of late last year .
But it may not be that simple .
David Viniar , Goldman Sachs ' ( GS , Fortune 500 ) chief financial officer , made headlines Wednesday when he voiced that very sentiment to attendees of a Credit Suisse conference , saying it would be easier for the company to run its business if it could pay back the $ 10 billion in capital it received from the government last fall .
And in a statement to CNNMoney.com Thursday , Bank of New York Mellon ( BK , Fortune 500 ) , which received $ 3 billion last year , said it was looking to redeem the government 's investment " as soon as is practical . "
These comments come at a time when public distaste for the nation 's banking industry is boiling over .
Taxpayers are seething over the fact that major financial firms continue to pay lavish bonuses and make seemingly frivolous purchases after getting government aid .
Earlier this week , President Obama struck back , announcing that the government would limit executive pay for any institution that accepts government financial aid in the future from programs such as the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP .
Fearing that lawmakers will make further demands , it 's no surprise that Goldman may want to free itself from more regulatory influence .
But Goldman , or other banks for that matter , can't just simply write the government a new check for the money they received last year .
And even if they could , it might not be a good idea .
Goldman Sachs and the other top banks that were recipients of the first round of TARP funding , including State Street ( STT , Fortune 500 ) , Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) , Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) and Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , were n't exactly given a choice about signing up when the program was first announced in October .
Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman Sheila
Bair defended the move at the time , saying it would help stabilize the shaky banking industry .
Credit market conditions may have improved somewhat since then , but it remains to be seen whether Goldman Sachs , or any other leading bank for that matter , is indeed healthy enough to shun government assistance and go it alone .
Mark Lane , an equity research analyst who tracks Goldman Sachs and rival Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) , which also received $ 10 billion in TARP funds , at Chicago - based investment firm William Blair & Co. , is one disbeliever .
" [ Goldman ] cannot fund their business on an unsecured basis , " he said " To say we do n't need TARP funds does n't make a lot of sense to me . "
Last quarter 's sharp downturn in the economy and dour capital markets activity rippled through the banking sector , resulting in billions of dollars in losses for many firms , including Goldman Sachs .
Shares of most major banks have tumbled this year , as a result .
What 's more , under the terms of the Treasury 's capital purchase program , a bank can only buy out the government 's stake as long as the money comes from an equity offering of a similar amount that meets government approval .
And in these market conditions , it seems highly unlikely that banks would be able to raise that much capital .
So many investors have gambled on U.S. financial firms over the past year and a half , only to watch those shares suffer another steep decline just months , or even weeks , later .
In addition , an offering of new shares would cause substantial dilution to the value of the holdings of existing shareholders , something that banks may not want to risk .
Ultimately Goldman and other banks simply do n't like being susceptible to the government 's bidding , according to one hedge fund manager , especially as the White House gears up to unveil its latest efforts to deal with the financial crisis on Monday .
" What it really comes down to is Goldman Sachs does not have control of its own destiny , " said James Ellman , head of San Francisco - based Seacliff Capital , a hedge fund specializing in financial services .
" The President of the United States does and the President of the United States will tell us in 3 to 4 days what Goldman Sachs ' options are . "

A Houston dentist will spend four years on probation and pay a $ 2,000 fine for putting videocameras in the bathroom of his southeast Houston office in a deal brokered Wednesday in court .
Byron Weinle , 58 , pleaded guilty to two of four counts of improper photography , a state jail felony , and received deferred adjudication , prosecutor Tiffany Johnson said .
She said Weinle will serve 30 days in jail , complete 250 hours of community service and write letters of apology to his victims .
The deal was made in state District Judge Michael McSpadden ’s court .
Criminal defendants who successfully complete the terms of deferred adjudication avoid final conviction , but the fact that they were charged remains a part of their record .
Two female employees reported they found tapes from the cameras in the office in August .
Johnson said the Texas State Board of Dental Examiners will determine whether Weinle keeps his dental license .
Improper photography is a state felony punishable by a maximum sentence of two years behind bars and a $ 10,000 fine for each count .
In 2001 , Texas banned sexually related photography and videotaping of people who do n’t give their consent .

This film is astonishing , it goes in detail through the untold history of The Project for the New American Century with tons of archival footage and connects it right into the present .
This film exposes how every major war in US history was based on a complete fraud with video of insiders themselves admitting it .
This film shows how the first film theaters in the US were used over a hundred years ago to broadcast propaganda to rile the American people into the Spanish - American War .
This film shows the white papers of the oil company Unocal which called for the creation of a pipeline through Afghanistan and how their exact needs were fulfilled through the US invasion of Afghanistan .
This film shows how Halliburton under their " cost plus " exclusive contract with the US Government went on a mad dash spending spree akin to something out of the movie Brewster 's Millions , yet instead of blowing $ 30 million they blew through BILLIONS by literally burning millions of dollars worth of hundred thousand dollar cars and trucks if they had so much as a flat tire .
I have seen a ton of films , this film contains a massive amount of incredible footage I have never seen before anywhere , it is an historical documentary which exposes all the lies of the past so that you can understand the present .
This film is a must see .

THE NEW AMERICAN CENTURY
" A stunning film .
It should be seen as widely as possible , in cinemas , bars , clubs , at meetings and , of course , through the internet .
I 'm sure the film will continue to be a source of debate and political education for many years .
Maybe until the war criminals have been brought to trial . "

" In the White House , they were n't thinking of 9/11 as an attack , but as a gift ! " - Robert Steele , former CIA agent
While Massimo Mazzucco ’s first political documentary , GLOBAL DECEIT ( 2006 ) , focused on the long list of inconsistencies in the official version of the 9/11 attacks , THE NEW AMERICAN CENTURY explores the historical , philosophical and economic background that suggests a matrix for such events that is much closer to home than the so - called " Islamic terrorism " .
The film provides solid evidence for the true reasons behind the Afghanistan and Iraq wars , whose unfolding is described in chilling detail in a document called " Project for the New American Century " , published in the year 2,000 , that seems to have served as the actual blueprint for such dramatic events .

Some important benefits of exercising after a heart attack can vanish in weeks if the exercise is stopped , a new study has found .
The researchers tested F.M.D.  flow - mediated dilation , a measure of the flexibility of an artery as blood flows through it  in 228 heart attack survivors .
Their arteries averaged about 4.2 percent expansion , compared with the 10 percent considered normal in healthy people .
Then the scientists divided patients into four groups to undergo resistance training , aerobic exercise , both together , or no exercise program at all .
Finally , the exercisers “ detrained , ” remaining idle for four weeks .
The study , published in the March 16 issue of the journal Circulation , found that the dilation had increased to 5.3 percent in the people who had not exercised , but to an average of more than 10 percent in the training groups .
After four weeks of detraining , dilation returned to almost exactly the initial levels in all three exercise groups .

Today , I had drunk sex with a girl that I barely know .
I did n't have a condom and was nervous about getting her pregnant , but she assured me that I could pull out .
Right when I was about to pull out , she wrapped her legs around me and yelled , " BE MY BABY'S DADDY ! " I could n't get out in time .

Financial Risk Management – Know What You can Tolerate
One of the issues that has come up recently is whether or not to get into buying stocks .
On one side are the investors that swear now is the time to take advantage of the investment bargains .
On the other side are those who think that it ’s time to get out of the stock market — ideally , two months ago .
Where you fall on this issue largely depends on your long - term view of stock picks as compared to other investments .
It also depends on your investment risk tolerance .
Risk tolerance
Financial risk management is vital to a healthy portfolio .
As you might guess , risk tolerance is a reflection of how much risk you can handle in terms of investing .
Some people have a higher risk tolerance — and can better handle the possibility of loss — than others .
However , there is a little more to risk tolerance .
Risk tolerance can be broken down into two main categories :
Financial risk tolerance measures how much risk you are financially capable of taking on , according to your money situation .
Financial risk tolerance is a fairly straightforward assessment of what you can handle .
Can you afford to put that money in the stock market and not use it for at least five years ?
Would losing the money you put into an ETF financially devastate you ?
This principle even works when you consider buying a home or making some other type of expenditure that requires a financial commitment and possible risk .
Financial risk tolerance is running the numbers and figuring out how much risk you can afford .
It ’s a reasonably objective process that is difficult to argue with .
Emotional risk tolerance , though , is purely subjective .
It deals more with your visceral reactions to what is going on .
You might have enough money to invest $ 2,000 in a stock , but if you are extremely concerned about everything that is going on right now , you may not be able — emotionally — to handle the stress involved in watching the losses mount until the market pulls out of its tailspin .
Your emotional risk tolerance speaks to the level of distress you feel when making investments .
Venture capitalists generally have a very high emotional risk tolerance :
They can handle the uncertainty that comes with risky investments , and they can recover emotionally when things do n’t work out as they expected .
Your level of emotional risk may however vary with the economic ups and downs as well as your financial situation .
Finding a Balance
The key is to create an investment strategy that allows you to grow your money in a way that you can afford , while at the same time not causing you undue emotional discomfort and stress .
Worry is a natural part of investing , but you should not commit to investments that cause you unhealthy levels of stress .
If the thought of currency market or futures market volatility makes you ill , or if you ca n’t afford the potential losses that come with heavily leveraged investments , stick to stocks , funds and cash .
It is important to note that risk management encompasses a partner relationship as well .
You and your life partner should discuss risk tolerance and what you are comfortable with .
Investment decisions should be made together , and you should compromise between your risk tolerance levels .
If you have a high emotional risk tolerance , but your life partner does n’t , you may have to find some middle ground .
It can strain the relationship if one of you becomes stressed over potential investment loss .
Managing your investment risk
In some cases , you may need to accept a little more risk in order to grow your wealth .
In such cases , you can temper your emotional response to risk with a balanced portfolio or with investments that carry different levels of risk .
Mutual funds and index funds add diversification that can help mitigate some ( but not all ) of the financial risk with investments .
Separately managed accounts also provide opportunities to experiment with different levels of investment risk .
An emergency fund , or large savings , can also help provide peace of mind when there is concern with regard to investments .
Carefully assessing your options and making a plan that take into account your risk management profile can help you become a more effective investor .
Spousal IRA : Retirement for Stay at Home Parents
Marriage is expected to be a partnership , and when the marriage involves a stay at home spouse , the partnership takes on one of different roles and responsibilities .
One person earns the requisite funds to run the household , while the other person cares primarily for the children and the home .
Unfortunately for most stay at home parents , fulfilling this necessary and thankless job can actually put their finances at risk .
Without their own retirement and / or savings accounts , stay at home parents may find themselves in even more difficult circumstances should the relationship change .
A Spousal IRA can help reduce the financial risk to stay at home parents , allowing them to save for the future .
What is a Spousal IRA ?
The Spousal IRA is designed for marriage partners who do not have jobs .
If your spouse works , you can open one up and contribute up to $ 5,000 in 2009 .
( If you are at least 50 , you can contribute an extra $ 1,000 as a “ catch up ” contribution . )
Your spouse must have earned enough income to cover the contribution , and you must be married filing jointly .
In a traditional IRA , this contribution is tax deductible .
You can also open a Spousal Roth IRA for a non-working spouse , but , as with a “ regular ” Roth IRA , the contribution is not tax deductible .
The advantage of the Spousal Roth IRA is that after age 59.5 , and if the account has been open for at least five years , withdrawals are made tax free from the Roth IRA — since contributions are n’t tax deductible , you ’ve already paid taxes .
IRS guidelines for the Spousal IRA
Obviously , though , it ’s not as simple as staying within the contribution limits .
There are all sorts of IRS guidelines , income phase - outs and mumbo- jumbo about who already has a qualified retirement plan .
Here are some of the basic limitations :
A non-working spouse can contribute his or her $ 5,000 , and a working spouse can also contribute $ 5,000 , bringing the total to $ 10,000 .
But only if neither partner already participates in a qualified retirement plan .
A “ qualified ” retirement account includes accounts set up by self - employed persons .
Non-working spouse ’s deductibility phases out when couples have an adjustable gross income of between $ 166,000 and $ 176,000 .
A working spouse ’s ability to make a deductible contribution for the non-working spouse starts to phase out with an adjustable gross income of $ 89,000 to $ 109,000 .
Can gay couples open a Spousal IRA ?
With marriage laws in Massachusetts and in California ( until the Prop 8 ban is carried out ) , there are questions about whether stay at home gay spouses can take advantage of the Spousal IRA .
The answer is an unequivocal “ no . ”
This is because in 1996 Congress passed the “ Defense of Marriage Act . ”
The act basically precludes any state laws allowing gay marriage by requiring that for purposes of federal laws , marriage is only between one man and one woman , and that a spouse can only be a member of the opposite sex .
This means that the federal law pertaining to IRAs does not recognize gay spouses as actual spouses .
Gay spouses can open their own IRAs , however , just like any other person who is not recognized as married by the federal government .
However , gay spouses cannot fund the IRA with money earned by their partners .
Instead , they must have a job and earn the money going into the IRA .
Of course , because the federal government does n’t recognize the marriage , gay spouses ’ earnings are n’t ever combined .
So that makes staying withing the adjusted gross income limits a little easier ( although it does n’t help non-working , full - time parent gay spouses , and is probably poor comfort ) .
Speaking with a knowledgeable tax planner or accountant , or visiting the IRS Web site , might be a wise idea before deciding what to do .
Most married couples , however , find that a Spousal IRA offers peace of mind for stay at home parents , and a certain amount of financial protection .
A stay at home spouse does a great deal of work that is not recognized with a paycheck , and he or she should be well taken care of .
A few years ago I was asked to give a presentation at my alma mater on the 1948 Israeli massacre of Palestinians in Deir Yassin .
Despite a nasty cold on the day of the talk , I grabbed a page of horrifying statistics and a handful of tissues and headed off to criticize Israel , wondering how many Zionists would come out and complain this time .
It turned out that I had only one dissenter ( from an admittedly small audience ) , an old professor of mine whose intellect and pedagogical style I had admired as a student ( and still admire as a professional ) .
I took three classes with this professor , finding all three valuable and interesting .
I knew at the time that he was Jewish , just as he knew that I was Arab , but we transcended assumed political differences through a mutual passion for literature .
I am still indebted to him for having written me a generous letter of recommendation for graduate school .
When my old professor turned up for the presentation , I had a feeling that he would n’t like what I was about to say despite the fact that I carefully avoided polemics and prepared a factual account of Israel ’s early war crimes , referencing standard historiography .
I struggled not to cringe when he raised his hand immediately after I finished speaking .
A minute later we were arguing vocally with one another .
I was mildly enjoying the opportunity to have at it with a former mentor and authority figure , but disturbed by the vitriol of his reaction to what I conceptualized as a tepid presentation .
I ’ve certainly said worse things about Israel on other occasions .
We soon reassumed our composure and attempted to think through our discrepant viewpoints .
As audience members and the event organizer , another former professor of mine , interjected their commentaries I could see my antagonist growing progressively agitated .
“ You do n’t believe in the right of Israel to exist , ” he suddenly declared .
I was taken aback not by the intimation of the declaration , but by the fact that nowhere in my prepared comments or in our argument did such a topic arise .
“ I do n’t think anybody here has heard me say anything about destroying Israel , professor , ” I responded coolly .
He would n’t drop the subject , though , bringing it up over and again , each time impelling me to affirm Israel ’s right to exist .
Each time , I ignored him or flatly refused .
He left the event shaking , inconsolable despite the doting of the event organizer .
There are lots of reasons why I declined my former professor ’s demand that I recognize Israel .
The first reason is practical : I never advocated for its destruction , and so it seemed peculiar to be asked to affirm its existence .
Nobody has ever asked me to affirm another nation - state ’s existence , a demand that I would in any case likewise decline .
Like anybody who values humanity above capital and hierarchy , I believe it is people and not national institutions that require our empathy and attention .
Besides , I was unhappy with the congenital violence implicitly ascribed to me while Israel ’s entrenched violence , which I had spend 45 minutes illuminating , once again benefitted from an uncritical perception as normative .
The other reasons for my reluctance to acquiesce to my former professor ’s peculiar demand are philosophical and political .
It is remarkably brazen for a nation founded on the destruction of Palestine and now embroiled in vicious forms of ethnic cleansing to ask the victims of its malevolence for recognition .
It is also a rhetorical trick that scarcely conceals some propitious imperatives : the legitimization of Israel as a Jewish - majority state ; the whitewashing of Israel ’s ugly past ; tacitly absolving Israel of its immoral behavior ; the privileging of Israel ’s needs at the expense of basic recognition of Palestinian needs .
I have no desire to encourage these imperatives .
Even if I did have the desire , I do n’t have the authority : it is not up to me or to any other individual to relinquish Palestine under the pressure of a spuriously humanistic insistence by Zionists that their perfidy be excused because it will somehow make me a more respectful and responsible person .
Many people , anyway , have written in more detail about the insidiousness underlying affirmations of Israel ’s “ right to exist , ” a phrase so ambiguous it should invoke any thinking person ’s suspicion .
Rather than limiting my discussion to philosophical , political , and practical factors , I ’d like to mention a worthy psychological reason to refuse the demand that anybody who wants to enter into a conversation about the Israel - Palestine conflict must first proclaim devotion to Israel ’s existence : principle .
Indeed , I would suggest refusing to acquiesce on principle .
Zionists hold nearly all the power in the Israel - Palestine conflict and much of the power in the culture wars the conflict inspires .
They have more funds , better access to corporate media , and the backing of the American military .
The Palestinians , however , hold one form of power that does n’t require money , media sympathy , or weaponry : the legitimacy that Zionists so desperately want us to confer to Israel .
It is a small power , one without a material apparatus , but it is power , nevertheless , one I am unwilling to relinquish , one I have no moral obligation to relinquish .
Zionists already took Palestine .
Now they ’re trying to appropriate our right to resist , too .
I am happy , eager even , to affirm the right of Jewish people to live in peace and security , wherever that may be , a right that all humans deserve in no particular order of worthiness .
But I wo n’t celebrate Israel ’s bloody founding and its goal of retaining a juridical ethnocentrism .
Ultimately , when Zionists demand that you affirm Israel ’s right to exist , what they are really asking for is your validation .
Do n’t give it to them .
Until Israel treats the Palestinians equally and humanely , it wo n’t have earned the right to a celebrated existence .
The Mouse that Roared or how the people of Bougainville defeated the Rothschilds
By Benjamin Fulford
2017/06/21
The Island of Bougainville in the South Pacific has been the scene of an epic decades - long struggle that resulted in locals , armed only with axes and bows , defeating troops armed with the latest world class weaponry .
The battle pitched the natives fighting to retain their ancestral homes against a Rothschild multinational fighting to steal the worlds ’ largest gold deposits at the Panguna mine .
As a result of their victory the Nasioi people of Central Bougainville became the first indigenous peoples in the world to force a global mining multinational to give up one of its richest ventures .
This is not just a local matter because there is so much gold on that Island that it could affect the future of the global financial system .
The international bankers say there are only a few tens of billions of dollars ’ worth of gold and copper there , but , if we use the fractional reserve methods employed by the Federal Reserve Board in 2008 to price gold ( 700 tons of gold was turned into 750,000 tons worth of gold backed bonds ) , then it is worth hundreds of trillions of dollars .
Furthermore , locals say the mine was covering up a massive money laundering operation by claiming gold was copper , meaning the mine , and six other known rich gold reserves on the island , are potentially worth hundreds of trillions of dollars even without fractional reserve magic .
“ They would take the gold out at night and hide it in caves , ” according to Bougainville Revolutionary Army sources .
The mine was operated by Rio Tinto Zinc from 1972 until 1989 before the locals shut it down , emerging victorious after a decade long war that resulted in the death of about 30,000 people or more than 10 % of the population , according to BRA sources .
A BRA general , “ Joel ” describes how the unarmed rebels were able to defeat a state of the art army .
“ When we first attacked them we only had axes and spears and knew that many of us would die , ” he says .
“ We used guerilla tactics , we attacked one soldier and took his gun , with that gun we could kill 3 or 4 other soldiers and take their guns and so on ; that is how we armed ourselves , ” he says .
Red Cross officials working on the island also say that to this day there are extra-judicial murders and many “ disappeared people , ” as a result of the conflict on the island .
Furthermore , the resistance army won the war only to face a blockade that , to some extent , continues to this day .
Rio Tinto Zinc claims they have handed over control of the mine to Bougainville Copper Limited ( BCL ) that is mostly owned by the Autonomous Government of Bougainville ( ABG ) .
Rio Tinto also claims they are not liable for the enormous environmental damage they caused by dumping mercury and other poisonous mine slurry into a local river because they were abiding by local laws at the time .
However , if you take a look at Bougainville Island on Google Earth you can still see clearly , decades after the mine closed , the scars on the landscape caused by it .
They should not be allowed to get away with environmental destruction so great that it shows up on satellite photos .
The Twin Kingdom of Meekamui and Papala , the locals ’ name for the island , is headed by King David Peii II who wants to charge the owners of Rio Tinto with war crimes and sue them for environmental destruction at the International Court of Justice in the Hague .
The BCL people for their part , are trying to re-open the mine and promise to be nice to the environment this time but the locals are so bitter about the mass murder and environmental destruction that they do not want BCL or ABG to have any role whatsoever in the mine .
This is how King David views the situation :
ABG ( Autonomous Bougainville Government ) is simply an agent of the Government of Papua New Guinea .
Its headquarters are located at Waigani , PNG .
Whoever controls PNG also controls ABG .
As you might be aware Australia granted independence to PNG in 1975 .
However , Australia still de facto controls PNG .
According to 2011 statistics Australia raked about K19.8 Billion PGK [ Papua New Guinea Kina , 1 kina=0.31 US dollars ] from its companies in PNG but only gave about K450 million PGK back in the form of AusAid .
That 's about 3 % only ; 97 % is retained in Australia .
The borrower is a slave to the lender .
PNGeans are happy to receive AusAid funds for their projects but do n't know the real story .
ABG , was established because the Bougainville leadership split up immediately after winning the 10 - year war against PNG and BCL / Rio Tinto .
The VP Joseph Kabui decided to negotiate with the PNG Government due to lack of funds for services , etc , while the President Francis Ona did not think it was right to negotiate .
Though both have now died and gone their successors are still alive and active .
I am the successor of the late Francis Ona under the Twin Kingdom Agreement .
ABG is down at the bottom end of the international food chain of that old control system , and therefore , cannot say nay to BCL , Rio Tinto , PNG , Australia or their hierarchies or controllers because " it 's a slave to its lenders " .
BCL ( B'ville Copper Ltd ) is still owned by foreigners ( or non-Bougainvilleans ) .
The shares they claim to have given to ABG are still controlled by foreigners because ABG itself is a foreign agent on Bougainville anyway .
ABG was established by its financiers ( PNG & Australia , etc ) to serve their own interests in our sovereign island nation .
What King David describes is true of much of the developing world where ruthless multinationals pillage the land with the help of mercenaries and locally hired and bribed “ leaders . ”
It is estimated that multinationals loot Africa alone to the tune of $ 60 billion a year .
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jul/15/aid-africa-west-looting-continent
In that sense , the battle for Bougainville ’s gold could mark a global turning point because King David promises to use the vast funds from the mine to help other developing countries .
Countries in Africa and other developing parts of the world would do far better being paid a fair price for their resources than receiving often useless “ foreign aid ” from the countries that are looting them .
In any case , it is clear that somebody powerful went to a lot of trouble to try to prevent this writer from visiting King David .
First of all , all flights into and out of Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea were cancelled the day after our arrival for unspecified reasons .
The result was to delay the arrival of King David ’s representative , Mealagan Krishnan .
Also , even though there are daily flights to the town of Arawa , a two and a half hour drive from the Kingdom ’s capital , these flights were mysteriously cancelled during the week of our visit .
We were forced to take a flight to the town of Boka , a grueling 7 hour drive from the Kingdom and when we got there we found the main road was blocked by “ a huge accident ” forcing us to go by boat and back roads .
One final literal roadblock was manned by BCL thugs who demanded a $ 1000 bribe to let us pass .
When I told their boss “ you cannot squeeze blood from a stone , ” he answered “ I can squeeze blood from a stone . ”
After much haggling we paid a $ 100 dollar cash bribe and were allowed to continue on our way .
Overall , our arrival was delayed by 4 days .
Finally , after meeting the King we were offered a tour of the Panguna mine on the following day .
However , instead we were roused in the middle of the night with a warning that 10 truckloads of mercenaries and corrupt police officers were on their way to try to force the land - owners of the Panguna mine to sign over the rights of the mine to BCL .
We were also told they would try to kill us .
The locals felled trees across the road and set up armed road - blocks to stop the mercenaries from chasing us after we left .
Armed conflict was avoided at the last minute but the BRA told us it was our arrival that led to the dispatch of the mercenaries .
In any case , as a result of our visit , we will be appealing for international help to allow the locals to develop the mine on their own in an environmentally friendly manner .
The King promises the billions or trillions of dollars that will flow from the mine will be used to help the people of Bougainville and the world .
Though many of the Bougainevillians we met were barefoot , they carried smart - phones and knew more about the true nature of the international financial system than the average reporter from the Wall Street Journal seems to ( I have met many of them over the years ) .
I would rather have King David in charge of the Bougainville gold than the ruthless and incompetent Khazarian central bank gangsters who have done so much harm to this planet and its people .
Both Rio Tinto Zinc and BCL ignored multiple attempts by this writer to contact them .
I find it intersting that God did n't let the Israel know about heaven and hell .
In the Old Testament we see no evidence of God saying to Israel you follow me you will spend eterity with me in heaven and if you do n't and are unfaithful you will spend eternity in hell .
Hades and Hell are n't even mentioned in the Old Testament .
As I read the Old Testament when refering to heaven it usually is taking about the skies , space .
You do see Isaiah 's vision in chapter 6 but would the Isreaelites really understand that vision .
You have the Jaboc 's dream and other instances of visions and encounters with angels and God but do the Israelites undersand it to be a place where they would be if they were faithful to God ?
Maybe they knew that God was there but do they have understanding that they would be ?
Did they understand the consequences and concept of hell if it is n't even mentioned .
Enoch walked with God and was no more and Elijah taken to heaven .
Notice their response and understanding where Elijah went in 2 Kings 2 : 16 : " Look , they said , " We your servants have fifty able men .
Let tehm go and look for your master .
Perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has picked him up and set him down on some mountain or in the valley .
" Why is the concept of heaven and hell not evident in the Old Testament and made evident in the New Testament ?
Can we understand their lack of knowledge and understanding about a Spiritual Kingdom and Messiah ?
Will those who where faithful to God in the Old Testament be in heaven and those who were n't be in hell ?
Is that very fair ?
Is Heaven and Hell even real ?
How would you respond to someone saying , " Would a loving God send someone to hell ?
" Is hell a real place of burning fire and sulfer or is it just Jesus trying to describe to us what it is going to be like ?
Is hell just separation fom God ?
How do you picture heaven ?
Will we know everyone ?
What is it going to be like ?
Do you think we will be suprised on who we are going to find in heaven and hell ?
Why ?
How does the world view heaven and hell ?
How should we teach and preach on these two subjects ?
Should we use them to motivate people to becoming Christians and disciples ?
Has the churches preaching on hell effected how people view the church , and now teach and preach to the world ?
What do you think ?

TSOGT , Mongolia --
Waves from the global economic downturn hit Sodnomdarjaa Khaltarkhuu when bank officials showed up at his tent on the edge of the Gobi desert and threatened to foreclose on his goats , sheep and camels .
Falling demand for cashmere among recession - hit shoppers in the West is cutting into earnings among nomadic herders in Mongolia , whose goats produce the soft fiber used in high - end sweaters , scarves and coats .
The result : herder loan defaults .
Mongolians ...
The leaders of Thailand and South Korea did not listen to such arguments , and thank goodness .
Some of the leading
Thai banks were taken over by the government .
After the crisis , a civil servant in charge of one such bank noted that its bad loans were much bigger than had been indicated before the takeover , largely because of an internal coverup .
Only when outsiders took over did the public discover the full scope of the losses .
The South Korean government also demanded that the banks and the chaebols make a clean break .
This generated a great deal of political noise  particularly when foreign managers were brought in , as when the Carlyle Group bought a stake in KorAm Bank in 2000 and Lone Star Funds purchased the Korea Exchange Bank in 2003 .
But these reforms made all the difference .
Banks became healthy and resumed lending within a few years after the crisis broke .
The chaebols that survived are stronger than they were before the crisis .
They are now withstanding the severe pressure of the global recession because they were forced to become better regulated , and more separate from banks .
Indonesia did not respond to the crisis so wisely , and the costs were severe .
In 1997 , Bambang Trihatmodjo , a son of President Suharto , had to close his troubled bank , Bank Andromeda , but proceeded to continue essentially the same operation under a different bank ’s name .
The new bank was only a small player in the overall economy , and the ruling elite seemed to think that no one would care .
But Indonesia lost the support of the United States when it reneged on promises to replace failed bankers with more competent and honest ones .
The lesson of all this is that when insiders have broken a financial institution , the most direct remedy is to kick them out .
Traders are hardly in short supply , and you do n’t need to rely on the ones who made the toxic trades in the first place .
Companies must always plan around the potential departure of even their star traders , or they are certain to fail .
A.I.G. does not need to keep all of its traders , especially since it takes far fewer people to unwind a portfolio than to build it up .
From the " it pays to be a beta tester " files :
Mozilla is set to release Firefox 3.0.4 on November 12th .
The first builds are now available for beta testers .
Firefox 3.0.4 is a stability and security update for Firefox 3.0.x - though at this point Mozilla has not yet issued any public security advisories on what the security issues are that 3.0.4 fixes .
Personally I have n't see anything on the public security lists ( a good thing ) - which means that ( as usual ) , Mozilla is keeping a tight lid on letting potentially damaging security information leak out early .
The 3.0.4 release is likely to be out a day after Mozilla releases Firefox 3.1 beta 2 - which could be interesting .
I wonder if there are issues fixed in 3.0.4 that are also dealt with in the 3.1 branch too .
Hey there , time traveller !

Manitoba 's First Nation leaders want the public and government to clamp down on people who post racist remarks about aboriginals on media websites .
" I 'm hoping for a public outcry that people will say that 's racist .
That 's enough , " Southern Grand Chief Morris Swan Shannacappo said Wednesday at a news conference to condemn racism on media blogs .
Swan Shannacappo and Chief Russell Beaulieu of the Sandy Bay First Nation called the media after university student - leaders came to them with the results of monitoring news sites from April 2008 to this month .
And what they read shocked them .
So , the leaders are asking for help to prevent racism in blogs either by public pressure or criminal deterrence .
There are " persistent bloggers who pounce on almost any story dealing with First Nations or indigenous issues and use it as an excuse to rant against or ridicule indigenous people , " Swan Shannacappo said .
" The world will always have its racists and kooks but the CBC is providing a vehicle for them with a forum to attack our people . "
CBC Manitoba was singled out by the Southern Chiefs Organization ( SCO ) , but similar comments are on media blogs across Manitoba .
Topics ranged from the Six Nations blockade in Caledonia , Ont. , Quebec First Nations angered by development plans , Manitoba First Nations protesting for a share of pipeline profits , the stalled Peguis land deal and a fatal fire on a B.C. reserve .
SCO leaders say the blog comments denigrate aboriginal culture beliefs , slam aboriginal people with racist insults , and trot out outdated stereotypes and misinformation .
Aboriginal leaders called on the Doer government to investigate the CBC for violations of Canada 's hate laws and pass on the findings to federal regulators .
They also want Manitoba to look at guidelines for blogging in general to prevent the expression of racist hatred .
Intergovernmental Minister Steve Ashton and Heritage Minister Eric Robinson said they were outraged by the comments posted on the CBC website .
" We believe there should be some type of apology to aboriginal people , " Ashton said .
" We share the concerns of the Southern Chiefs Organization .
These comments were racist .
They were offensive .
They were unacceptable . "
Robinson added , " As Canadians , we do n't pay taxes to create a platform for hate speech . "
Both ministers said that because CBC and the Internet are federally responsibilities , there is little the province can do except encourage the Southern Chiefs to file complaints with the CBC 's ombudsman and Canadian Human Rights Commission .
Ashton also said it 's important any news organization or person posting public comments should police them for offensive statements and language .
" Let 's avoid the problem before it happens , " he said .
CBC spokesman Jeff Keay said the CBC news website received almost 200,000 comments in January .
All comments on news sections of the website are reviewed by a moderator before they are posted publicly , he said .
That means some comments make it through that are later removed , he said ,
" Providing a forum for people to , you know , express their view on contentious issues brings a risk , " said Keay .
" We recognize that occasionally there is material there that should n't appear . "
He confirmed SCO previously contacted CBC Winnipeg .
