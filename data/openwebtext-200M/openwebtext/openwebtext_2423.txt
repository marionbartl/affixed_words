The infamous Xbox 360 " red ring of death " ( indicating a failed unit ) has caused Microsoft - and its customers - untold pain in the three years since the console 's launch in 2005 , and cost it $ 1.15 bn ( £ 738 m ) last year .
Microsoft has never said publicly why the console was plagued with faults : it seems that poor production quality was at the heart of the failures - an all - round problem with no single cause except impatience on the company 's part as it tried to become the leader in videogame consoles .
It was an ambitious attack .
Microsoft 's engineers started working on the Xbox 360 at least a year after Sony 's engineers began work on the PlayStation 3 , yet wound up shipping a year earlier .
With the first Xbox , the company lost $ 3.7 bn ( £ 2.3 bn ) over four years , mostly because costs of the box - particularly its hard drive - were too high .
Bill Gates did n't really care about the losses ; that was simply the ante for getting into an exciting new business .
But Steve Ballmer , who took over from Gates as chief executive during the first generation , really wanted the Xbox business to be profitable second time around .
Software - hearted
Even though early testing showed that production machines had flaws , Microsoft did n't delay the launch because it believed the quality problems would subside .
" They got enamored with the idea of the Microsoft army rolling everything out at the same time , " says one source .
" Their thinking shows that they are a software company at heart , " says one veteran manufacturing executive .
" They put something out and figure they can fix it with the next patch or come up with a bug fix . "
In the hurried design process , Microsoft decided late to add a hard disk drive , and then wireless controllers .
The hard drive blocked airflow on one side of the machine ; the wireless modules had to have enough space to avoid electrical interference .
The console shell was poked full of holes to ensure airflow .
In the end , the machine was a series of compromises .
" It turned out in the end that this was all going too far , too fast , " says a source .
" They were adding too many features after things were locked down .
That incremental feature adding just made it fragile . "
Some of the defects were latent , potentially not showing up for some time after the machine was used .
Up to 50 % of all defects can be latent .
And production yields - the number of machines coming off the production lines that passed testing - were low .
In August 2005 , the machines ' aggregate defect rate - from Microsoft 's contract manufacturers Flextronics and Wistron , in their factories in China - was allegedly just 68 % .
In a memo dated August 30 2005 , the team reported overheating graphics chips , cracking heat sinks , cosmetic issues with the hard disk and the front of the box , underperforming graphics memory chips from Infineon ( now Qimonda ) , a problem with the DVD drive - and more .
At that point , the contract manufacturers were behind schedule and had only built hundreds of units when they were supposed to be making thousands every week .
" There were so many problems , you did n't know what was wrong , " says a source .
" The [ test engineers ] did n't have enough time to get up and running . "
Shutting down production to debug everything properly might have delayed the launch in Europe or Japan .
Microsoft responded to this story ( in full at Venturebeat.com ) with a statement that it has already acknowledged an " unacceptable number of repairs " to Xbox 360 consoles and had responded to the hardware failures with a free replacement program .
" This topic has already been covered extensively in the media , " the statement said .
" This new story repeats old information , and contains rumors and innuendo from anonymous sources , attempting to create a new sensational angle , and is highly irresponsible . "
I have tried to verify the facts .
Microsoft has never disclosed its actual return rates .
But according to data obtained by VentureBeat , the total number of returns climbed above 1.2 m consoles early last year .
That is a huge figure , considering Microsoft had only shipped 11.6 m consoles to stores by the time of the writeoff in mid-2007 .
The warning signs were present even before Microsoft shipped any machines .
In August 2005 , as Microsoft was gearing up production , an engineer said : " Stop .
You have to shut down the line . "
When production results are really off - kilter , stopping a line and tracing a problem back to its roots is the answer .
But in this case , the decision was made to carry on .
Nobody listened to that engineer , apparently because console launches are always hurried affairs .
Yields generally start low .
As the manufacturers analyse data and tighten controls on each assembly step , they learn how to drive the yields up .
On November 22 2005 , the Xbox 360 went on sale .
Consumers could run graphically beautiful games on high - definition TVs .
But machines started failing almost immediately .
At the time , the company said it had received " isolated reports " of console failures and that returns were within the normal range .
According to the Consumer Electronics Association , the average return rate for products where the consumer gets their money back is about 2 % .
Microsoft 's internal data assumed that in the long term 6 % or 7 % of the consoles would be defective before shipping into the market - a yield of 94 % or 93 % .
The rate of return was expected to be low as well .
But even after 2005 , Microsoft struggled to ship enough units .
The yield was typically only around 70 % - far short of the target - until May 2007 .
Problems denied
By the end of March 2006 , Microsoft said it had shipped more than 3.3 m consoles to retailers .
But there was a growing " bone pile " of more than 500,000 defective consoles in a warehouse at Wistron and a repair centre in Texas - either duds off the factory line or returned boxes , according to sources .
Production yield was climbing , but far too slowly .
Meantime , Microsoft stood by its statement that returns were within " normal rates " .
The denial of widespread problems infuriated customers such as Chris Szarek , who has had five bad consoles : he felt Microsoft was stonewalling .
But as production ramped , Microsoft sent replacement units out more quickly and dealt with those who were unhappy about the shortage .
In September 2006 Microsoft conceded that the quality of the consoles made during 2005 was n't as high as it expected and said that it would extend the policy of free replacement for consoles made during 2005 , even though the warranties had expired .
But what was actually wrong with the machines ?
In July 2007 Robbie Bach , president of Microsoft 's entertainment and devices division , said of the launch that " we were confident the product was ready .
We did a lot of testing .
The problem that shows up with the three red lights on the console is a complex interaction with some very complex parts . "
There was no single reason for the failures - though many could be blamed on the graphics chip , which could overheat so much it warped the motherboard .
This stressed bad solder joints , causing them to fail early in the machine 's life - and the console was also one of the first products that had to meet new environmental standards in Europe prohibiting the use of lead in solder .
Paul Wang , a Microsoft test engineer on the Xbox 360 , said in a speech in 2007 that lead - free solder created a lot of problems .
Wii takes the lead
Sometimes the heatsinks on top of the GPU were put on the wrong way , resulting in overheating .
Games would sometimes crash because of sub - par memory chips from one of the two suppliers .
Problems with the DVD drive lasted longer than expected .
Eventually , in January last year , Microsoft shut down manufacturing of the console and did n't build any more machines until June .
Early this year , SquareTrade , which sells warranties for electronics , reported that was seeing a 16.4 % failure rate for Xbox 360s .
Michael Pachter , an analyst at Wedbush Morgan , estimates that the number is 3 m , about 15 % of the total .
In the meantime , Nintendo's Wii has outstripped rival consoles around the world , having sold some 35 m machines since its launch at the end of 2006 .
Microsoft has sold about 22 m Xbox 360s since its 2005 launch , while the Sony PS3 , which came late to the party with a European launch in March 2007 , has sold 16.6 m consoles around the world .
But is the war really lost ?
Shane Kim , head of the game division 's business development efforts , recently said that it was too early to call the console war in favour of Nintendo .
We wo n't know the winner , he says , until somebody sells 100 m units .
Microsoft 's plan is to sell 75 m Xbox 360s .
The only way it could ever do that is to be more aggressive on its pricing .
And by doing the right thing for its customers from now on .

One of my dearest female friends is in a relationship with a friend of her own .
It ’s not an unhealthy relationship , but the man has made it clear to my friend that it has a definite ending as he needs to move away for a job .
She understands this , intellectually anyway .
But there ’s some question as to whether our intellect can overrule our emotion in every instance and in every situation .
I suspect that the more time we spend with another person involved in intimacies , the more intimate we get regardless of our overall intentions .
I would even go so far to say that it ’s inevitable .
That like that old premise in “ When Harry Met Sally , ” men and women ca n’t just be friends .
Well , I mean that they definitely cannot just be friends if they ’re actively engaging in a sexual relationship .
I know my friend knows that , so intellectually , she ’s cool .
But I also know that matters of the heart can often short - circuit our rationality , leading us to engage in behaviors that , in the long - run , may not be emotionally the most healthy for us .
These thoughts led me to look up the research literature on “ friends with benefits , ” and I was pleasantly surprised to come away with a few citations where this phenomenon has actually been studied .
These kinds of relationship most often occur in younger adults ( high school and college - age students ) who are still actively exploring their sexuality .
Puentes and his colleages ( 2008 ) collected over 1,000 surveys of undergraduates and came away with the following observations on these “ friends with benefits relationships ” ( FWBRs ) :
1. Males .
Over sixty percent of the men ( 63.7 % ) compared to slightly over half ( 50.2 % ) of the women reported experience in a friends with benefits relationship .
While not statistically significant , McGinty et al. ( 2007 ) also found men more likely participants and concluded that , “ men focus on the benefits , women on the friends ” aspect of the friends with benefits relationship .
Previous research comparing men and women has emphasized that men think more about sex , report a higher number of sexual partners , and engage in more frequent sexual encounters than women ( Michael et al. , 1994 ) .
2 . Casual daters .
Respondents who were casually dating different people ( 76.3 % ) were significantly more likely to report experience in a FWBR than those emotionally involved with one person ( 49.3 % ) or not dating / involved with anyone ( 49.9 % ) .
It is clear that while the respondents were having sex with a friend , they did not define the relationship as a dating relationship that was going anywhere .
To the contrary , the participants had a dating life ( or were open to one ) with different people that was separate from the friends with benefits relationship .
3 . Hedonist .
Undergraduates selecting hedonism ( 82.2 % ) as their primary sexual value were significantly more likely to be involved in a friends with benefits relationship than those selecting relativism ( 52.3 % ) or absolutism ( 20.8 % ) .
Unlike relativists who prefer sex in the context of a love relationship and absolutists who wo n’t have sex outside of a marriage relationship , hedonists are focused on sexual pleasure , not the relationship with the person .
4 . Sex without love .
It comes as no surprise that participants in a FWBR were adept at having sex independent of love .
Indeed , over 80 percent of participants in a FWBR reported that they had had sex without love , compared to 13.4 % of non participants who preferred sex in the context of a love relationship .
This difference was statistically significant .
5 . Nonromantic / realist .
In contrast to romantics who believed that there is only one true love / love comes only once , nonromantics ( also known as realists ) viewed this belief as nonsense .
Analysis of the data revealed that undergraduate realists who believed that there were any number of people with whom they could fall in love ( 57.9 % ) were significantly more likely to be a participant in a friends with benefits relationship than were undergraduate romantics who believed in one true love ( 44.7 % ) .
In effect , nonromantics believe that they would have many opportunities to meet / fall in love and that a friends with benefits relationship would not cancel out their chance of doing so .
Hughes et al. ( 2005 ) also found that persons involved in a friends with benefits relationship had a pragmatic view of love .
6 . Question deep love ’s power .
Participants were less likely than nonparticipants to believe that deep love can help a couple get through any difficulty .
Slightly over half ( 52.7 % ) of participants in a FWBR reported they did not believe in the power of deep love compared to over 60 % ( 62.3 % ) of nonparticipants who did believe in such power .
We interpret this finding as another example of participants being nonromantic realists who were not focused on romantic love in their relationships .
7 . Jealousy .
Undergraduates identifying themselves as a jealous person ( 58.8 % ) were significantly more likely to be involved in a friends with benefits relationship than those who did not view themselves as jealous ( 51.1 % ) .
We are not sure how to interpret this data as we would assume just the opposite .
Nevertheless , the data show that participants are more jealous .
Perhaps those having sex with a friend wonder how many other sexual partners their “ friend ” has and want to feel that they are “ special ” and “ unique . ”
8 . Blacks .
In regard to racial differences , over sixty percent of blacks ( 62.5 % ) in contrast to over half of the whites ( 52.9 % ) reported involvement in a friends with benefits experience .
Previous research comparing blacks and whites on interpersonal issues revealed that blacks valued romantic relationships less than whites , were less involved in an exclusive relationship , and were less disclosing in intimate relationships ( Giordan et. al. , 2005 ) .
Data from the National Survey of Family and Households also revealed great instability of black compared to white marriages ( Raley 1996 ) .
A “ friends with benefits ” relationship which provides minimal emotional investment for a sexually involved couple is not inconsistent with relationship instability .
9 . Higher class rank / age .
The more advanced the undergraduate in class rank , the more likely the undergraduate reported involvement in a friends with benefits relationship : freshmen = 45.4 % , sophomore = 55.1 % , junior = 55.2 % and senior = 62 % .
As might be expected , the older the student , the more likely the FWBR involvement with those 20 and older being more likely .
We suspect that age increases one ’s opportunity for a FWRB experience and that older undergraduates given the opportunity for a FWFR are more likely to cash in .
10 . Money focused .
When asked about their top value in life , undergraduates identifying financial security ( 67.9 % ) were significantly more likely to be in a friends with benefits relationship than those who identified having a career that they loved ( 53.9 % ) or having a happy marriage ( 48.5 % ) as their primary life value .
Seemingly , the pursuit of money was more important than a love relationship moving toward commitment or marriage and they ( participants in a friends with benefits relationship ) took sex in whatever convenient context they could get it .
Frankly , the more I read about friends with benefits relationships , the more convinced I am that my friend is n’t actually involved in one of these ( since they occur with increasingly less frequency as one ages and matures ) .
Perhaps she ’s simply in a relationship in which the man is simply unawares or purposely ignorant .
As long as she is aware , and is n’t expecting more from the relationship than he ’s willing to give , then I think it ’s fine .
But I also think it ’s difficult for us , as humans , to separate sexuality from our emotions ( even though it appears men are more able to do so than women ) .
Even when men do so , I believe many do so only outwardly .
Inside , perhaps unconsciously , they still feel the connection they ’re making through sex .
Because sex is more than just a physical act of pleasure .
It strips us , if just for a moment , of all of our social masks , and bares our physical desires ( and some might argue , our souls ) to the other person .
While men may deny that happens , I ca n’t help but believe it does .
Maybe not in everyone , but I think in more men than research shows .
As for my friend , I worry about her .
While she ’s a smart , attractive , and wonderful person , I think she may be blinded by her own cynicism about relationships , love , and attraction .
But after awhile , it ’s hard not to .
When you meet so many people who are just interested in relationships on their own terms ( and for their own ends ) , it can be hard to see the forest through the trees .
Or the man who has feelings for you , despite his protestations to the contrary .

Friends with Benefits
The jury is still out over whether the chicken or egg came first .
But turns out dinosaurs were laying bird - like eggs long before chickens roamed Earth .
A rare fossilized dinosaur nest helps answer the conundrum of which came first , the chicken or the egg , two paleontologists say .
The small carnivorous dinosaur sat over her nest of eggs some 77 million years ago , along a sandy river beach .
When water levels rose , Mom seems to have fled , leaving the unhatched offspring .
Researchers have now studied the fossil nest and at least five partial eggs .
The nest is a mound of sand that extends about 1.6 feet ( half a meter ) across and weighs as much as a small person , or about 110 pounds ( 50 kg ) .
" Some characteristics of the nest are shared with birds , and our analysis can tell us how far back in time these features , such as brooding , nest building , and eggs with a pointed end , evolved — partial answers to the old question of which came first , the chicken or the egg , " said researcher Francois Therrien , curator of dinosaur paleoecology at the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Alberta , Canada .
The answer ?
Well , it ’s still unclear whether chicken eggs or chickens came first ( the intended question in the original riddle ) , said Darla Zelenitsky , a paleontologist of the University of Calgary in Alberta who was the first scientist to closely analyze the dinosaur nest .
But interpreted literally , the answer to the riddle is clear .
Dinosaurs were forming bird - like nests and laying bird - like eggs long before birds ( including chickens ) evolved from dinosaurs .
" The egg came before the chicken , " Zelenitsky said .
" Chickens evolved well after the meat - eating dinosaurs that laid these eggs . "
So the original riddle might now be rephrased :
Which came first , the dinosaur or the egg ?
Meanwhile , the new nest provides some of the strongest evidence in North America in favor of the bird - like egg over the chicken .
Rare dino nests
The fossil nest was collected in the 1990s and kept at Canada Fossils Limited in Calgary , Alberta .
That 's where Zelenitsky first spotted the remains , which were labeled at first as belonging to a duck - billed dinosaur , an herbivore .
( In 2007 , the fossil was acquired by the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology in Alberta . )
Zelenitsky realized that the nest and eggs actually belonged to a small theropod , a meat - eating dinosaur .
In particular , the egg - layer was likely a maniraptoran , the group of theropods that paleontologists think birds derived from some 150 million years ago during the Jurassic Period .
" Nests of small theropods are rare in North America and only those of the dinosaur Troodon have been identified previously , " said Zelenitsky .
" Based on characteristics of the eggs and nest , we know that the nest belonged to either a caenagnathid [ a family of maniraptorans ] or a small raptor , both small meat - eating dinosaurs closely related to birds . "
She added , " Either way , it is the first nest known for these small dinosaurs . "
The only other egg clutch identified to date from a maniraptoran in North America belonged to Troodon formosus .
Egg - laying behaviors
The analysis of the nest , detailed in the latest issue of the journal Palaeontology , provides paleontologists with information about egg - laying in this particular dinosaur and others , along with the evolution of various egg - laying behaviors , Therrien said .
" Our research tells us a lot about the dinosaur that laid the eggs and how it built its nest , " he said .
For instance , the position and spacing of the eggs suggest the original clutch contained at least 12 eggs arranged in a ring around the mound 's flat top , where the theropod would have sat and brooded its clutch .
The eggs were about 5 inches ( 12 cm ) long and , like bird eggs , they were pointed at one end .
The analysis also suggests the dinosaur laid its eggs two at a time on the sloping sides of the mound .
That 's unlike , say , crocodiles , which lay all their eggs at once , and more like birds , which lay one egg at a time .
( The ancestors of crocodiles gave rise to dinosaurs and later on , birds . )
As if figuring out the chicken - egg puzzle were n't enough , the researchers also have another objective : " To find the same kind of nest with babies inside , " Zelenitsky told LiveScience .
" There are dinosaur eggs from North America with baby bones preserved inside of them .
It 's entirely possible , but again these types of nests ( from small meat - eating dinosaurs ) are fairly rare . "

' Joe the Plumber ' publishes book , gets grilled by CNN Stephen C. Webster
Published : Tuesday December 23 , 2008
Print This Email This Good 'ole Joe. ' Joe the Plumber , ' that is .
And now , introducing , ' Joe the Author . '
Joe Wurzelbacher , the supposed common man whom Sen.
John McCain made famous during his presidential campaign , has a book .
And not just any book , but a Book with quite the catchy title .
" Joe the Plumber : Fighting for the American Dream . "
Sadly for Joe 's Republican Senator friend , that American dream is somewhat critical of McCain .
Or , as CNN put it Tuesday , Joe has thrown the aging Arizonian " under the bus . "
" In the book , you say that the McCain campaign was quote , ' fragmented and disorganized , ' " said CNN anchor John Roberts .
" And you go on to say quote , ' I did not want him in the Republican ticket .
I do not agree with a great many of his policies , nor do I care for aspects of his voting record . '
" He stood by you when you said during an interview that a vote for Barack Obama was a vote for the death of Israel .
So , he was here , backin ' you up , and here you are throwing him under the bus now .
Why ? "
Joe portended a lengthy response , but summarized his winding point with , " I 'm not throwing McCain under the bus .
That 's factual .
That 's just what happened . "
Roberts , reemphasizing this proverbial ' bus , ' pressed on .
" So , I guess this throwing him under the bus aspect of this Joe , comes in on this idea that you 're out there on the campaign trail , you were stumping for John McCain , you did n't say anything about it then .
He loses the election , and now you 're writing a book for profit saying all of these things about him .
" Many people take that as throwing him under the bus .
If you felt so strongly about it during the campaign , why did n't you say something then ? "
Joe laughed at the question , and got back on the bus .
" Well , it 's not so much ahm , people are saying I 'm throwing him under the bus , it 's the media saying I 'm throwing him under the bus .
But , you know , let 's correct that .
Let 's let them decide that when they read the book . "

We ’re all suckers for a big number , and you ’ll be delighted to hear that the Journal of Consumer Research has huge teams of scientists all eagerly writing up their sinister research on how to exploit us .
One excellent study this month looked at how people choose a digital camera .
This will become relevant in three paragraphs ’ time .
The researchers took a single image , then processed it in Photoshop to make two copies : one where the colours were more vivid , and one where the image was sharper .
They told participants that each image came from a different camera , and asked which they wanted to buy .
About a quarter chose the one with the more colourful sharper image .
Then the researchers started to pile it on .
Firstly they said that this camera had more pixels , using a figure derived from the diagonal width of the sensor : suddenly more than half picked it instead .
Then , crucially , they told them that this camera had more pixels , but this time , they used the number of pixels as evidence : a figure measured , as you know , in millions .
Suddenly , three quarters chose the supposedly better camera .
Just a bigger number .
Nothing more .
This week you ’ll have noticed the news on rosuvastatin ( or Crestor , since either through ignorance , or corporate whoredom , the media love to help drug companies by using their corporate brand names instead of the generic ) .
The JUPITER trial on rosuvastatin has just reported , several months early , and most papers called it a “ wonder drug ” .
The Express , bless them , thought it was an entirely new drug .
“ Heart attacks were cut by 54 per cent , strokes by 48 per cent and the need for angioplasty or bypass by 46 per cent among the group on Crestor compared to those taking a placebo or dummy pill ” , said the Daily Mail .
Dramatic stuff .
And in the Guardian , we said : “ Researchers found that in the group taking the drug , heart attack risk was down by 54 % and stroke by 48 % ” .
Is this true ?
Yes .
Those are the figures on risk , expressed as something called the “ Relative Risk Reduction “ .
It is the biggest possible number for expressing the change in risk .
But 54 % lower than what ?
This was a trial looking at whether it is worth taking a statin if you are at low risk of a heart attack ( or a stroke ) , as a preventive measure : it is a huge market – normal people – but these are also people whose baseline risk is already very low .
If you express the exact same risks from the same trial as an “ Absolute Risk Reduction “ , suddenly they look a bit less exciting .
On placebo , your risk of a heart attack in the trial was 0.37 events per 100 person years , and if you were taking rosuvastatin , it fell to 0.17 events per 100 person years .
0.37 to 0.17 .
Woohoo .
And you have to take a pill every day .
And it might have side effects .
And if you express the risk as “ Numbers Needed To Treat “ , probably the most intuitive and concrete way of expressing a benefit from an intervention , then I reckon , from the back of this envelope in front of me ( they naughtily do n’t even give the figure in the research paper ) , that a couple of hundred people need to take the pill to save one life .
Is it a good idea for you personally to take rosuvastatin ?
That ’s not my job here – get over yourself , we ’re allowed to talk about ideas – but the way figures are presented can have a huge impact on decisions everyone makes , and this is not idle speculation .
In fact the phenomenon has been carefully studied , in many groups , and for many years .
In 1993 Malenka et al recruited 470 patients in a waiting room , and gave them details of a hypothetical disease , and a choice of two hypothetical treatments .
In fact it was the same treatment , with the risk expressed in two different ways .
56.8 % chose the medication whose benefit was expressed as a relative risk reduction , while only 14.7 % chose the medication whose benefit was in absolute terms ( 15.5 % were indifferent ) .
Are patients uniquely stupid ?
Joy , no .
In fact the exact same result has been found repeatedly in experiments looking at doctors ’ prescribing decisions , and even the purchasing decisions of health authorities .
We all love big numbers , and we ’re all fooled by big numbers , because we ’re all idiots .
That ’s why it ’s important to think clearly , and ignore all newspapers .

After some six months of leaks and previews , the long - awaited World Energy Outlook report from the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) is finally out .
And in many ways , it is the bombshell we expected .
The agency struck a new tone of urgency in the report , as it sharply reduced its outlook for the growth of world oil production .
The opening paragraph was blunt and on the mark :
The world 's energy system is at a crossroads .
Current global trends in energy supply and consumption are patently unsustainable - environmentally , economically , socially .
But that can - and must - be altered ; there 's still time to change the road we 're on .
[ 1]
It is not an exaggeration to claim that the future of human prosperity depends on how successfully we tackle the two central energy challenges facing us today : securing the supply of reliable and affordable energy ; and effecting a rapid transformation to a low - carbon , efficient and environmentally benign system of energy supply .
What is needed is nothing short of an energy revolution .
For the first time , the IEA included in its analysis a study of the depletion rates of the world 's top 800 oil fields .
Why they did n't include that crucial information in the past we do n't know , but as readers of these pages are well aware , it 's the hole in the bucket that is the very heart of the peak oil study .
The rates they found were high enough to surprise even me : 6.7 % [ 2 ] for past - peak fields , increasing to 8.6 % by 2030 ( the end date of the report 's " reference scenario " ) .
Averaged across all fields , the rate is 5.1 % , [ 3 ] but that includes 3.4 % for the very largest fields , 6.5 % for the next - largest and 10.4 % for the next size down .
This is important , because the fields being discovered today are all in the smaller categories .
As the world 's largest and most productive fields , which are also its oldest , go past their peaks and into decline , the smaller newer fields with the higher depletion rates play a more dominant role .
But these are only the " observed decline rates . "
The authors distinguish that from a " natural decline rate , " which " strips out the effects of ongoing and periodic investment " ( whatever that means ; as far as I am aware , all oil fields require some sort of ongoing investment ) .
The authors note that the natural decline rates " are about a third higher on average than observed decline rates , " with a current global average of about 9 % , increasing to 10.5 % by 2030 .
Against such high decline rates - up from a generally accepted 4.5 % estimate only a year ago - the agency calculates that the world will need to add a whopping 64 million barrels per day ( mbpd ) of new capacity between 2007 and 2030 in order to meet an anticipated demand growing at 1.6 % per year .
That 's like adding six new Saudi Arabias ( up from five less than two years ago , when I wrote Profit from the Peak ) .
That 's like adding a new Kuwait every single year .
The report goes on to say if the world does not add 30 mbpd of new capacity by 2015 — equivalent to three new Saudi Arabias — it " will cause an oil - supply crunch " by 2030 .
More incredibly , that 30 mbpd must include 7 mbpd of new capacity above and beyond all currently planned projects !
That 's over 1 mbpd of new , unplanned , unfunded capacity , plus a presumed 5 mbpd of planned new capacity ( which seems highly doubtful ) every year for the next 6 years .
Where Do You Find Six New Saudi Arabias ?
One might reasonably ask then , just where exactly do they think all that new oil is going to come from , since global oil discovery has been in continuous decline for over 40 years ?
The IEA sidesteps this question , blithely noting that " The volume of oil discovered each year on average has been higher since 2000 than in the 1990s , thanks to increased exploration activity and improvements in technology , though production continues to outstrip discoveries ( despite some big recent finds , such as in deepwater offshore Brazil ) . "
A chart of the history of world oil discovery quickly nullifies that thin argument :
Here is the IEA 's scenario , in graph form , on where those six new Saudi Arabias will come from :
You can see the clear peak of " currently producing fields " right around now , after which we 'll have a massive increase in " fields yet to be developed " followed by another big chunk of " fields yet to be found . "
A steady increase in " non-conventional oil " and natural gas liquids round out the supply picture .
( We 'll get to the problems with this scenario in a moment . )
Finally , they project that the rate of oil production will increase fairly steadily to 104 mbpd ( excluding refinery gains ) by 2030 , at which point a peak in global production is implied , but not directly stated :
Although global oil production in total is not expected to peak before 2030 , production of conventional oil - crude oil , natural gas liquids ( NGLs ) and enhanced oil recovery ( EOR ) - is projected to level off towards the end of the projection period .
Conventional crude oil production alone increases only modestly over 2007 - 2030 - by 5 mb/d - as almost all the additional capacity from new oilfields is offset by declines in output at existing fields .
The bulk of the net increase in total oil production comes from NGLs ( driven by the relatively rapid expansion in gas supply ) and from non-conventional resources and technologies , including Canadian oil sands .
Out of morbid curiosity , I dug up a few older World Energy Outlook reports from the IEA for comparison .
Their 2006 report had oil production increasing to 116 mbpd by 2030 , needing only $ 4.3 trillion in investment to achieve .
And their 2004 report did n't see any peak before 2030 , and needed only $ 3 trillion to achieve 121 mbpd by 2030 .
See a pattern here ?
They 're slowly backing into the truth .
Here 's my prediction : their 2010 report will state that the new peak is only 95 mbpd , at a cost of over $ 30 trillion .
And by 2012 , they 'll admit that the peak was in fact in June of this year , at 87 mbpd .
By 2030 , fully 20 years past the peak , world oil production will likely be under 70 mbpd .

Coming Clean
Several new admissions caught my eye .
For one , they finally seem to have put their hopes for a resurgence in non-OPEC production to rest , saying it is " at plateau and is projected to start to decline by around the middle of the next decade . "
This was a bit of a vindication for me , as I had struggled with the lower - quality data I could get nearly three years ago when researching Profit from the Peak , and concluded that all future production would have to come from OPEC , despite what the official projections said .
Another pleasant surprise was this statement : " The super - majors have been struggling to replace their proven reserves and expand production , while the share of their cash earnings that is returned to shareholders has been growing . "
Back when I was writing Profit from the Peak I suspected as much , but was n't able to round up the data to completely prove it , and besides , my Wall Street buddies thought I was being too " conspiratorial " about that point .
Boo -yah , boys !
I also have to applaud their sharp criticism of the way that the corrupt governments of the African oil - producing nations do not share their oil revenue wealth with their desperately impoverished peoples .
This is an issue I wrote about in the book that is hardly ever mentioned in the energy press , but which remains a serious threat to future oil production .
So long as the criminal inequity of the status quo maintains , Africa will never be stable enough that we can count upon her to help produce the world 's precious few remaining barrels .
The $ 26 Trillion Question
In order to accomplish all this , the IEA projects that the world will need to spend $ 26 trillion [ 4 ] by 2030 , or over $ 1 trillion per year .
Of that , over $ 13 " goes simply to maintain the current level of supply capacity " because so much of the world 's energy infrastructure will need to be replaced by then .
As Matthew Simmons has often noted , most of the existing worldwide oil industry infrastructure is literally rusting away .
Ultimately , this report chooses to lay the question of future oil production at the feet of investors .
If that $ 1 - trillion - plus a year materializes , the IEA believes the energy can be had .
If not , it wo n't be the fault of geology or technology that oil production does n't meet our projected demand .
And their projected increases will have to come from essentially unproven sources .
So much for their scenario .
Our question is : Can it be done ?
Or perhaps more accurately , will it be done ?
Yhprum's Law
The only way I can see the IEA scenario coming to pass is under the opposite of Murphy 's Law , which Wikipedia tells me is " Yhprum 's Law . "
That is , everything that can possibly go right , will .
In particular :
Most of the new oil and gas production would have to come from OPEC , since non-OPEC is " at plateau . "
[ That phrasing is so pretentious that from now on , I shall refer to the oil peak as a plateau with an aristocratic French accent . ]
Yet only Saudi Arabia has any real hope of significantly increasing its supply .
It has recently produced around 10 mbpd , it has a stated capacity of about 12 mbpd , and some anticipate ( while others doubt ) that it will eventually reach 15 mbpd .
But that 's really about it for any OPEC production growth .
The Saudi king has also stated more than once that he 's more interested in long - term stewardship of the resource than in short - term maximization of profits .
So let 's be generous and give all of OPEC a net production increase of 5 mbpd over current levels .
IEA anticipates a massive new wave of production from the Canadian tar sands .
Yet Suncor and other major tar sands producers have recently announced that they are scaling back their production plans due to the low price of oil , the uncertain global growth outlook , and problems in arranging credit for the massive capital needed to expand these projects amid a global credit market lockup .
From a current level of about 1.5 mbpd production from the tar sands , I believe the research that points to a possible 3.5 mbpd a plateau by 2030 .
But the absolute peak of 5 mbpd looks increasingly doubtful , due to the availability and cost limitations on water and natural gas .
So I 'd allow no more than another 2 mbpd for the tar sands by 2030 .
Third , the reliance on enhanced oil recovery ( EOR ) will prove , I think , to be a false hope .
The decades - long history of EOR suggests that perhaps it does n't increase total recovery at all , it just produces some of the remaining oil faster ; or in the best case , it thickens and lengthens the tail of production somewhat .
The implication in the report that the global recovery rate might be raised from the current roughly 30 % to some 40 % seems highly unlikely to me based on the historical evidence .
The report still claims that reserves are growing in a significant way ( which is wishful thinking ) and that current proven reserves of oil and NGLs of around 1.2 - 1.3 trillion barrels " is enough to supply the world with oil for over 40 years at current rates of consumption . "
This is truly one of the low points of the report , since the authors surely know that oil production does n't go a plateau for decades , then suddenly hit a wall and go to zero .
After the peak , it declines , gradually , on the back of a bell curve .
By avoiding any clear statement on the global peak , and pinning such enormous hopes on such slim straws as EOR and undiscovered fields , the report avoids having to deal with such unpleasant details .
The fact is that 20 years from now , we 'll likely be down to three - quarters of today 's energy budge , and 40 years from now , we 'll be down to less than half .
That 's the fact that any honest assessment of our situation would emphasize , not some misleading statistic about 40 years ' worth of oil .
It 's more like 100 years ' worth , at production rates that decline relentlessly , starting right about now .

The report claims that ultimately recoverable conventional oil resources will prove to be 3.5 trillion barrels .
Again , this seems extremely unlikely , as it is based on a significant amount of oil yet to be found , and highly questionable reserves growth .
I believe 2.3 trillion barrels is closer to the right number here , with 1.1 already produced and 1.2 still to go .
Similarly , the report anticipates a production of 1 - 2 trillion barrels from tar sands and extra- heavy oil ( the stuff that Venezuela has in abundance ) , plus oil shales ( which I believe will never prove to be economical ) , for a total of some 6.5 trillion barrels .
Then they add in another 2.5 trillion barrels for coal - to - liquids and gas - to - liquids , for a total of 9 trillion barrels in unconventional what - have - yous .
This conjecture would require another entire article to debunk , so I wo n't get into it now ( it 's all in my book anyway ) , but suffice to say that I would be very surprised to see this lot , put together , add more than half a trillion barrels to the recoverable total .
The money , the money , the money .
Can anybody really conjure up a scenario , given the current state of the financial markets and the prospect of a global recession for the next year or more , that the world is somehow going to commit to spending more than $ 1 trillion per year for the next 22 years straight ?
When oil is hitting new lows daily , and a global deleveraging is sucking money out of every energy investment under the sun ?
If they can , I want some of what they 're smoking .
IEA chief economist Fatih Birol expressed his own concerns : " We see and hear about energy investments being delayed ...
This is a major worry and could lead to a supply crunch and much higher oil prices than we 've seen before . "
The press slide deck reinforced this point , asking if the financial crisis and economic slowdown will affect investment in energy to the point where it sets us up for a supply crunch once the economy gets back on its feet .
( This is an important question I plan to take up in a future article . )
The $ 35 Trillion Challenge
As for the price outlook on oil , I think the agency 's assessment was good :
Prices are likely to remain highly volatile , especially in the next year or two .
A worsening of the current financial crisis would most likely depress economic activity and , therefore , oil demand , exerting downward pressure on prices .
Beyond 2015 , we assume that rising marginal costs of supply exert upward pressure on prices through to the end of the projection period .
The report also placed a heavy emphasis on controlling carbon emissions , and was unequivocal about the importance of merging the energy and climate change challenges into a unified effort — something I have advocated for years .
I have no doubt that carbon emissions will soon come with a global price , and that those who are well positioned to profit from it , be they carbon credit marketers or wind power generators , will see a booming future .
In addition to the $ 26 trillion investment in energy infrastructure , the report suggests another $ 9.2 trillion will need to be invested in carbon control in order to meet a goal of 450 parts per million of CO2 equivalent in the atmosphere .
So that 's our global challenge : to invest another $ 35 trillion in energy and carbon emissions over the next 20 years .
That means an unprecedented market opportunity for clean energy technologies like wind , solar , geothermal , biomass and marine energy .
It means that we literally must throw money hand - over - fist at renewable energy and an electrically powered infrastructure .
In sum , I do n't find their scenario terribly credible .
Adding another 64 mbpd of oil production capacity from the existing , very well explored , and very well exploited resource base - a 74 % increase over current levels - seems quite impossible even under the best of circumstances , let alone attempting it even as the largest fields are going into decline .
Which means that the real outlook for oil production and its cost is likely much worse than even this dire - sounding warning from the IEA suggests .
And the outlook for renewable energy is even greater .
While the report certainly has its flaws , on the whole I think it 's a big move in the right direction for the IEA .
It 's heartening to see them stepping up and addressing the twin devils of climate change and peak oil more directly , and I hope that the world is paying attention to its unflinching warning .
We 'll let them have the last word :
For all the uncertainties highlighted in this report , we can be certain that the energy world will look a lot different in 2030 than it does today .
The world energy system will be transformed , but not necessarily in the way we would like to see ... [ W] hile market imbalances could temporarily cause prices to fall back , it is becoming increasingly apparent that the era of cheap oil is over ...
It is within the power of all governments , of producing and consuming countries alike , acting alone or together , to steer the world towards a cleaner , cleverer and more competitive energy system .
Time is running out and the time to act is now .
Until next time ,
Chris

As any good peak oil student knows , the details and definitions matter a great deal .
Here , 6.7 % is the " average production - weighted observed decline rate , " as distinguished from the " natural decline rate . "
[ 3 ]
The 5.1 % rate is " the observed post - peak decline rate averaged across all fields , weighted by their production over their whole lives "

In year 2007 dollars
Royal Bank of Scotland , which is being bailed out with £ 20bn of taxpayers ' money , has signalled it is preparing to pay bonuses to thousands of staff despite government pledges to crack down on City pay .
The bank has set aside £ 1.79 bn to cover " staff costs " - including discretionary bonuses - at its investment banking division for the first six months of the year alone .
The same division caused a £ 5.9 bn writedown that wiped out the bank 's profits for the same period .
The government had demanded that boardroom directors at RBS should not receive bonuses this year and the chief executive , Sir Fred Goodwin , is walking away without a pay - off .
But below boardroom level , RBS and other groups are preparing to pay bonuses to investment bankers who continue to generate profits .
The disclosure drew fierce criticism from Vince Cable , the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman .
" The government said they would attach strict conditions on bonuses and it is very clear they are doing nothing of the kind .
" The banks are just making complete monkeys of them . "
He suggested the government would not have agreed to bail out any standalone investment bank .
RBS and others had become " entangled with casino - style investment banking operations " , he said .
Despite the continuing financial turmoil and widespread criticism of the bonus culture in the City , the bank is understood to believe the payments are defensible .
A source said : " I think everybody would expect [ that those responsible for writedowns ] would not get a bonus .
But there are people who still made fairly substantial money in other product areas - you cannot just not pay them bonuses , they will just go elsewhere . "
Asked about the likely bonus culture after taxpayer - funded bail - out , the source said : " If the government does end up becoming a shareholder , RBS is still a listed entity .
It remains the board 's responsibility to ensure it is run commercially . "
Several US politicians have seized on an investigation by the Guardian last month which showed six Wall Street banks - Goldman Sachs , Citigroup , Morgan Stanley , JP Morgan , Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers - had set aside $ 70 bn ( £ 42.5 bn ) in pay and bonuses for the first nine months of the year .
Five are in line to benefit from a $ 700 bn US taxpayer bail - out .
The sixth , Lehman Brothers , has collapsed - though not without securing considerable bonus payouts for staff in the US .
Henry Waxman , chairman of the House oversight committee , wrote to chief executives of America 's nine largest banks this week asking them to hand over information about their pay and bonus plans .
In his letter Waxman cites the Guardian report and says : " Some experts have suggested that a significant percentage of [ bankers ' pay ] could come in year - end bonuses and that the size of the bonuses will be significantly enhanced as a result of the infusion of taxpayer funds . "
Staff costs at RBS 's investment banking division include salaries already paid in the first six months of the year , national insurance and profit - sharing contributions as well as funds earmarked for end - of - year bonuses .
The sum set aside is 20 % lower than the equivalent figure for the first six months of 2007 .
Banking sources privately acknowledge that the sight of these bonus accruals may provoke anger .
They concede the industry 's pay and bonus regime is under unprecedented strain as it fails to reflect profitability , asset writedowns or share price declines .
Obama reassures big business on economic policy
By Patrick Martin
8 November 2008
In his first public appearance as president - elect , Barack Obama held a press conference in Chicago Friday afternoon after meeting for several hours with a selected group of economic advisers , comprised entirely of bankers , corporate executives and current and former government officials .
Members of Obama ’s Transitional Economic Advisory Board and other economic advisers , including former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker and Clinton - era treasury secretary and current Citigroup executive Robert Rubin , were lined up behind Obama as he answered questions from reporters .
In his opening statement to the press conference , Obama underscored the gravity of the economic crisis , citing the report earlier in the day that a net 240,000 US jobs were lost in October .
“ In total , we ’ve lost nearly 1.2 million jobs this year , and more than 10 million Americans are now unemployed , ” he said .
“ Tens of millions of families are struggling to figure out how to pay the bills and stay in their homes .
Their stories are an urgent reminder that we are facing the greatest economic challenge of our lifetime , and we must act swiftly to resolve them . ”
He proposed no immediate actions , however , emphasizing that President Bush remains in the White House until next January 20 .
Obama was clearly seeking to divorce himself from responsibility for the rapid increase in economic distress which is expected over the next two months .
“ Immediately after I become president , ” he said , “ I will confront this economic crisis head - on by taking all necessary steps to ease the credit crisis , help hard - working families , and restore growth and prosperity . ”
But he gave few details of what policies he might propose , other than including an extension of unemployment benefits in a new “ economic stimulus ” package .
While acknowledging the depth of the crisis , Obama was at pains to downplay expectations of any rapid economic recovery , saying , “ It is not going to be easy for us to dig ourselves out of the hole that we are in . ”
Obama declared , “ We need a rescue plan for the middle class , ” but the composition of his Transitional Economic Advisory Board belies his claim to be focusing on the economic difficulties of ordinary people .
The panel consists entirely of representatives of the corporate and financial elite and the Democratic wing of the political establishment .
The 17 members of the panel include billionaire Warren Buffett , the richest man in America , the CEOs of Xerox and Google , the chairman of the board of Time Warner , Hyatt Hotels heiress Penny Pritzker , and Citigroup Vice Chairman Rubin .
Joining them in the meeting that preceded the press conference were former Clinton administration officials William Daley , Robert Reich , Laura Tyson and Lawrence Summers , as well as two former commissioners of the Securities and Exchange Commission , Volcker and former Fed Vice Chairman Roger Ferguson , former Democratic Congressman David Bonior , Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm and Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa .
The panel had the obligatory gender and racial diversity — two black members , two Hispanics , four women — but not even a semblance of class diversity .
There was not a single individual representing workers , the unemployed , consumers , homeowners or those facing foreclosure and homelessness .
Nor were there any representatives of the labor federations — the AFL - CIO and Change To Win — which poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the Obama campaign — or of African - American , Hispanic and women ’s organizations , such as the NAACP and NOW .
Some 16 years ago , the last time that a Democrat replaced a Republican in the White House , President - elect Bill Clinton was at pains to include high - ranking union officials at his economic summit in Little Rock .
But so socially irrelevant have the trade unions become that Obama and his advisers do not consider it necessary to make even a pretense of consulting them in the making of economic policy .
Two indications of future Democratic policy emerged at the press conference .
Obama strongly suggested that the Bush administration ’s $ 700 billion bailout of the banks — adopted with the support of the Democratic - controlled Congress , including Obama ’s own vote — would be expanded to include the auto industry .
When asked point blank whether he would stick to his campaign pledge to cut taxes for those making less than $ 200,000 a year and raise taxes on those with incomes of $ 250,000 , he responded by leaving open the possibility that this policy would be reconsidered .
“ I think that the plan that we ’ve put forward is the right one , but obviously over the next several weeks and months , we ’re going to be continuing to take a look at the data and see what ’s taking place in the economy as a whole , ” Obama said .
“ The goal of my plan is to provide tax relief to families that are struggling , but also to boost the capacity of the economy to grow from the bottom up , ” he added , in what was an implicit concession to the arguments by business groups and congressional Republicans that a tax hike on the wealthy would damage economic growth .
Obama made no criticism of the Bush administration ’s handling of the bank bailout , saying only that his transition office would monitor it to make sure the Treasury was “ protecting taxpayers , helping homeowners and not unduly rewarding the management of financial firms that are receiving government assistance . ”
The language , in avoiding any criticism of Wall Street speculators and CEOs , is both telling and consistent with the tenor of Obama ’s election campaign .
As during the campaign , Obama avoids any exposure , let alone condemnation , of the social interests which are responsible for the economic crisis and which underlie the policies of the Bush administration .
Whatever Obama ’s criticisms of Bush or the Republican presidential candidate John McCain , the Democratic president - elect represents the same class interests -- the financial aristocracy which rules America and subordinates the social and economic life of the country to its drive for personal enrichment .

Postmenopausal women who have lost interest in sex may be able to bring their libidos back to life with a testosterone patch , according to new research published this week in The New England Journal of Medicine .
Even though results were modest , one expert called them meaningful .
However , the use of the male hormone to boost sex drive in women may not be risk - free .
Out of the 814 women in the study , four women who were taking testosterone developed breast cancer , but none of the women on placebo did .
It 's not clear whether this was a statistical blip or a warning sign that excess testosterone could cause or spur the growth of a malignancy .
Some women also reported excess hair growth , although none stopped using the hormone for this reason .
Susan R. Davis , M.D. , Ph.D. , of Monash University in Australia , and colleagues in the United States , Canada , and Sweden , evaluated two different doses of testosterone delivered by Procter & Gamble Pharmaceuticals ' Intrinsa patch .
In 2004 , a U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) panel gave Intrinsa the thumbs down and called for larger , longer studies to ensure that the medication was safe , in addition to proving that it actually helped women 's sex lives .
As the new findings show , it did .
Wearing the higher - dose testosterone patch boosted a woman's " satisfying sexual experiences " by an average of 2.1 times every four weeks , compared to an increase of just 0.7 such experiences for women taking a placebo .
Both testosterone doses used in the study seemed to increase desire and decrease distress .
" Although the change in activity is modest , that 's something that is appropriate and I think most women would be more than happy with it , " says study co-author Sheryl A. Kingsberg , Ph.D. , chief of behavioral medicine at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland , Ohio .
" They wanted to return to the level of desire they had in their premenopausal years , and that 's what they got . "
Before starting treatment , the women in the study had been having satisfying sex about twice a month on average , Kingsberg points out ; the higher - dose patch increased that to once a week .
" For most women and providers of health care for women , that modest benefit is clinically meaningful , " agrees North American Menopause Society president JoAnn V. Pinkerton , M.D. , a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Virginia , in Charlottesville , who did not participate in the study .
Some women lose interest in sex during and after menopause , due in part to the drop in estrogen that comes with the " change of life . "
While taking estrogen can increase lubrication and possibly restore a woman 's sex drive , hormone replacement is now understood to raise the risk of heart disease and stroke .
Many physicians prescribe testosterone instead , although there is currently no testosterone product that 's FDA - approved for treating women with " hypoactive sexual desire disorder . "
The European Union has approved Intrinsa , but only for women who have had their ovaries removed , a procedure also known as surgical menopause .

In the current study , 814 women who had undergone either surgical menopause or natural menopause were randomly assigned to use daily a placebo patch or an Intrinsa patch containing either 150 or 300 micrograms of testosterone .
The trial lasted for a year , and a subset of women was followed for an additional year .
Procter & Gamble Pharmaceuticals sponsored the study and helped design the trial as well as collect and analyze the data .
" Based on these data and other studies we 've conducted , we are continuing our talks with [ the ] FDA to explore new opportunities and pathways forward , " says Procter & Gamble spokesperson , Tom Milliken .
One of the women on the 300 - microgram dose was found to have breast cancer three months after the study ended ; three others in the testosterone groups learned they had the disease between four and 12 months after treatment began .
" We do not know if the testosterone patch contributed to proliferation or metastasis of the breast cancer in women diagnosed in the earlier months of the study , potentially affecting their long - term survival , " says Leslie R. Schover , Ph.D. , a behavioral scientist at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center , in Houston , who recently wrote an article analyzing research on testosterone for low libido .
" A valid safety study needs at least a five - year follow - up period in a large , randomized trial .
If women use Intrinsa without such a trial , I believe they are risking their lives to gain a very modest increase in sexual desire . "
Learn why birth control is safer than ever ( and sometimes it 's even good for you )
But Dr. Davis says she is not concerned about the increased breast cancer risk seen in the study .
Four breast cancer diagnoses among 814 women during a two - year period " is not unexpected , " she says , and given that twice as many study participants were taking testosterone than were on placebo , " it is probably a chance finding that they were in the two treatment groups . "

Many doctors who treat postmenopausal women -- and prescribe testosterone off - label to some of them -- say a treatment tailored to women is sorely needed and would probably be safe with short - term use .
" We do n't have enough safety data to say it 's safe for long - term use , but I think short - term , the benefits clearly outweigh the risks , " Dr. Pinkerton says .

But some experts warn that a pill or patch is n't always the answer to a sexual problem .
" For women there are so many other things that can contribute to sexual issues , starting from the fact that the most important sex organ is the brain , " says Marcie Richardson , M.D. , director of the Harvard Vanguard Menopause Survey in Boston .
" I 'm glad that people are trying to sort this out with good objective evidence , but I hope we do n't fall victim to the notion that this is all about medication , because it 's not . "

We ai n’t monkeyin ’ around here .
Yesterday I talked about what ’s new with the SP1 of .NET 3.5 and about ASP .
NET MVC in front of around 50 people in the sunny city of Bari : I really enjoyed doing these two talks , and the public was fantastic .
Furthermore it was a pleasure to meet in person people I only “ met ” virtually on the forum or through blogs .
Today , after recovering from the trip from Milan to Bari , I organized the material and I put everything on the server for everyone to download .
Slides are in Italian , but samples are language - agnostic and most of the terms in the slides are in English anyway .
So , even if you were n’t among the 50 guys ( and gals ) , you can download the slides and the samples and have a look at them .
I also want to give the url for fun stuff that people really liked :
the infamous MVC song , that I played in loop during all the breaks
the MVC Public Announcement Videos
If you attended the presentation , I ’d like to hear a comment from you , and I hope to meet you again soon .
I just realized I did n’t talk about my first official meeting as MVP , at the MVP Italian OpenDays last weekend : I ’ll post some pics and talk about it in few days .
Gen . David H. Petraeus ’s decision to withdraw another combat brigade six weeks ahead of schedule reinforced the assurances by Iraq ’s defense minister that his troops could handle more of Iraq ’s security and sent a signal that the American troop withdrawals would become a reality .
An Obama administration is also expected to shift the focus to Afghanistan .
American officials have said that as the war deteriorates in Afghanistan , any additional forces sent there would have to be from among troops withdrawn from Iraq .
Mr. Obama ’s election also coincided with the American negotiators ’ acceptance of many of the changes Iraqis demanded in the agreement , which created an overall picture that was easier both for the Iraqis and their neighbors  Iran , Syria and Saudi Arabia  to accept .
The American negotiators sent a new version of the agreement to Iraqi leaders on Thursday that included many of the changes Iraqis had demanded .
In public , Iraqis said merely that they were studying the document .
Over all , however , there was a new tone of optimism .
“ The atmosphere is positive with the American attempt to preserve the sovereignty of the Iraqi nation , ” the government ’s spokesman , Ali al - Dabbagh , told the news channel Al Arabiya .
He praised the inclusion of a new provision stating that Americans would not launch attacks on Iraq ’s neighbors from Iraqi soil .
The Americans also added language to make explicit what kinds of troops would remain after the withdrawal in 2011 , said a Bush administration official knowledgeable about the security pact .
Those still in Iraq would be primarily trainers and air traffic controllers , the official said .
“ There ’s going to be a significant presence , but they are not going to be ‘ combat ’ forces , ” said the administration official .
The official said that the most recent talks with Iraqis had given American negotiators confidence that a final agreement was close .

JOHN STUART MILL once dismissed the British Conservative Party as the stupid party .
Today the Conservative Party is run by Oxford - educated high - fliers who have been busy reinventing conservatism for a new era .
As Lexington sees it , the title of the “ stupid party ” now belongs to the Tories ' transatlantic cousins , the Republicans .
There are any number of reasons for the Republican Party 's defeat on November 4th .
But high on the list is the fact that the party lost the battle for brains .
Barack Obama won college graduates by two points , a group that George Bush won by six points four years ago .
He won voters with postgraduate degrees by 18 points .
And he won voters with a household income of more than $ 200,000 — many of whom will get thumped by his tax increases — by six points .
John McCain did best among uneducated voters in Appalachia and the South .
The Republicans lost the battle of ideas even more comprehensively than they lost the battle for educated votes , marching into the election armed with nothing more than slogans .
Energy ?
Just drill , baby , drill .
Global warming ?
Crack a joke about Ozone Al. Immigration ?
Send the bums home .
Torture and Guantánamo ?
Wear a T - shirt saying you would rather be water - boarding .
Ha ha .
During the primary debates , three out of ten Republican candidates admitted that they did not believe in evolution .
The Republican Party 's divorce from the intelligentsia has been a while in the making .
The born - again Mr Bush preferred listening to his “ heart ” rather than his “ head ” .
He also filled the government with incompetent toadies like Michael “ heck - of - a- job ” Brown , who bungled the response to Hurricane Katrina .
Mr McCain , once the chattering classes ' favourite Republican , refused to grapple with the intricacies of the financial meltdown , preferring instead to look for cartoonish villains .
And in a desperate attempt to serve boob bait to Bubba , he appointed Sarah Palin to his ticket , a woman who took five years to get a degree in journalism , and who was apparently unaware of some of the most rudimentary facts about international politics .
Republicanism 's anti-intellectual turn is devastating for its future .
The party 's electoral success from 1980 onwards was driven by its ability to link brains with brawn .
The conservative intelligentsia not only helped to craft a message that resonated with working - class Democrats , a message that emphasised entrepreneurialism , law and order , and American pride .
It also provided the party with a sweeping policy agenda .
The party 's loss of brains leaves it rudderless , without a compelling agenda .
This is happening at a time when the American population is becoming more educated .
More than a quarter of Americans now have university degrees .
Twenty per cent of households earn more than $ 100,000 a year , up from 16 % in 1996 .
Mark Penn , a Democratic pollster , notes that 69 % call themselves “ professionals ” .
McKinsey , a management consultancy , argues that the number of jobs requiring “ tacit ” intellectual skills has increased three times as fast as employment in general .
The Republican Party 's current “ redneck strategy ” will leave it appealing to a shrinking and backward - looking portion of the electorate .
Why is this happening ?
One reason is that conservative brawn has lost patience with brains of all kinds , conservative or liberal .
Many conservatives — particularly lower - income ones — are consumed with elemental fury about everything from immigration to liberal do - gooders .
They take their opinions from talk - radio hosts such as Rush Limbaugh and the deeply unsubtle Sean Hannity .
And they regard Mrs Palin 's apparent ignorance not as a problem but as a badge of honour .
Another reason is the degeneracy of the conservative intelligentsia itself , a modern - day version of the 1970s liberals it arose to do battle with : trapped in an ideological cocoon , defined by its outer fringes , ruled by dynasties and incapable of adjusting to a changed world .
The movement has little to say about today 's pressing problems , such as global warming and the debacle in Iraq , and expends too much of its energy on xenophobia , homophobia and opposing stem - cell research .
Conservative intellectuals are also engaged in their own version of what Julian Benda dubbed la trahison des clercs , the treason of the learned .
They have fallen into constructing cartoon images of “ real Americans ” , with their “ volkish ” wisdom and charming habit of dropping their “ g ” s.
Mrs Palin was invented as a national political force by Beltway journalists from the Weekly Standard and the National Review who met her when they were on luxury cruises around Alaska , and then noisily championed her cause .
Time for reflection
How likely is it that the Republican Party will come to its senses ?
There are glimmers of hope .
Business conservatives worry that the party has lost the business vote .
Moderates complain that the Republicans are becoming the party of “ white - trash pride ” .
Anonymous McCain aides complain that Mrs Palin was a campaign - destroying “ whack job ” .
One of the most encouraging signs is the support for giving the chairmanship of the Republican Party to John Sununu , a sensible and clever man who has the added advantage of coming from the north - east ( he lost his New Hampshire Senate seat on November 4th ) .
But the odds in favour of an imminent renaissance look long .
Many conservatives continue to think they lost because they were not conservative or populist enough —
Mr McCain , after all , was an amnesty - loving green who refused to make an issue out of Mr Obama 's associations with Jeremiah Wright .
Richard Weaver , one of the founders of modern conservatism , once wrote a book entitled “ Ideas have Consequences ” ; unfortunately , too many Republicans are still refusing to acknowledge that idiocy has consequences , too .
The genetic make - up of a candidate in the next US presidential election could be exploited by an opponent to raise doubts about their health or personality .
So say medical researcher Robert Green and medical lawyer George Annas , both at Boston University .
Anyone who wants a sample of a candidate ’s DNA could probably get it from coffee cups or cutlery that the person has used , or perhaps even handshakes .
Combine that with the fact that a well - funded campaign could now afford to pay for a whole - genome scan , and the divulging of a candidate ’s genome becomes a genuine possibility , Green and Annas write in The New England Journal of Medicine ( vol 359 , p 2192 ) .
Such an act is more likely to aid demagoguery than make reliable predictions , though : at present , little is known about the genetic roots of personality , while most genes associated with a disease only slightly bump up the risk of developing the condition .
“ You could say truthfully that candidate A is at elevated risk for disease X , but that might increase his or her risk from 6 per cent to 6.5 per cent , ” says Green .
“ That ’s not really very meaningful . ”

Unscrupulous opponents could nevertheless try to exploit the idea that the candidate ’s “ bad genes ” make him or her a poor choice , however misleading such a statement might be to those who do n’t understand such details .
George Church , a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School in Boston , sees one possible benefit to set against such dangers .
A dust - up over a presidential candidate ’s genes could motivate the general public to learn more about genetics , he says .

Researchers at Queen ’s University are developing a new robotic system to service more than 8,000 satellites now orbiting the Earth , beyond the flight range of ground - based repair operations .
Currently , when the high - flying celestial objects malfunction – or simply run out of fuel – they become “ space junk ” cluttering the cosmos .
“ These are mechanical systems , which means that eventually they will fail , ” notes Electrical and Computer Engineering professor Michael Greenspan , who leads the Queen ’s project .
But because they are many thousands of kilometres away , the satellites are beyond the reach of an expensive , manned spaced flight , while Earth - based telerobotic repair is n’t possible in real time .
Dr. Greenspan ’s solution to this problem is the development of tracking software that will enable an Autonomous Space Servicing Vehicle ( ASSV ) to grasp the ailing satellite from its orbit and draw it into the repair vehicle ’s bay .
Once there , remote control from the ground station can be used for the repair , he explains .
“ The repair itself does n’t have to be done in real time , since everything is in a fixed position and a human can interact with it telerobotically to do whatever is required . ”
The Queen ’s team is now working to develop the ASSV with the aerospace company MDA ( McDonald - Detweiller Associates ) Space Missions , which earlier built the Canadarm and has been responsible for all Canadian systems in the International Space Station .
Computer vision is the main technical challenge of grasping the satellites , Dr. Greenspan continues .
Since these objects circle the globe in “ geosynchronous ” orbit , their speed is synchronized with the Earth ’s rotation .
The robotic system must recognize the satellite first , then determine its motion and match that motion before grabbing it .
Due to the harsh illumination conditions in space , conventional video cameras are of limited use .
The preferred sensor is a form of light - based radar called LIDAR , which provides a set of 3D points that accurately measure the surface geometry of the satellite .
The Queen ’s team , which includes Electrical and Computer Engineering graduate students Limin Shang , Babak Taati and Michael Belshaw , has developed software that allows such a system to identify a satellite , determine its position and finally track it in real time , using this specialized range data .
They have recently received funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council ( NSERC ) to continue looking at fundamental aspects of this new technology .
Another potential , terrestrial application of their findings is in the area of “ flexible ” manufacturing , says Dr. Greenspan .
Using vision systems and algorithms , objects can be recognized and tracked as they go down a conveyor belt or assembly line .
” Once you can do that , automated manufacturing systems can interface much more flexibly with the objects , ” he notes .
“ The result will be a much easier and more cost effective manufacturing process . ”
We have killed so many zombies in a single day that it seems improbable , even impossible : over 11,000 .
We are , of course , playing Left 4 Dead .
Beneath the cut we have the first - impressions of each of the four RPS editors .
It ’s been a long , noisy day of gaming .
When we close our eyes , all we can see are burning zombies .
John :
One of the most important features of Left 4 Dead is the necessity that it be interesting to play repeated times .
Despite a single play through of all four campaigns lasting about as long as the average console shooter , that ’s not how it ’s intended to be played .
You ’re meant to keep coming back , charging through each zombie - infested level again and again , in the company of your buddies .
So having had the chance to play through Blood Harvest and No Mercy before , going back to them gave me an important perspective .
Despite there being certain key moments in each level , it was n’t the same game again .
And playing with different people ( and in the case of playing with RPS , very different people ) makes it a very different time .
I think that was possibly my big concern with Left 4 Dead , and it seems to have been taken care of .
The Director , the omniscient controller of what happens in the game , seems genuinely capable of mixing things up in such a way that you ca n’t make cohesive plans .
Which is exactly how it should be – this is a zombie apocalypse , and being able to predict events would spoil it .
Not knowing if crossing a certain bridge spells certain doom , or a casual walk through the pretty countryside , amps up the tension .
There ’s still those bottleneck moments when you can not only expect a brutal attack , but form rudimentary plans for dealing with them .
Turning the difficulty up on Blood Harvest , the rural campaign setting finishing with a terrifying enslaught on a farmhouse , we struggled big time .
With repeated attempts , we formulated multiple plans to get through it , which went from simple variations such as how to arrange ourselves on the lower floor of the building and when to retreat to upstairs ( imagine a building with the frighteningly fast undead coming in through every door and window , climbing the sides of the building , attacking you from every angle ) , all the way to hiding in the large barn on the farm grounds , in the hope it might be easier to defend .
( It was n’t ) .
What stands out the strongest for me , and I think is even more significant than the variation the Director offers , is the people you play with .
I know Kieron , Jim and Alec pretty well .
We spend an improbable amount of time in each other ’s company .
We know each other well enough to insult each other ’s mothers while looking out for each other .
It ’s ideal company for such a game .
You really ca n’t do anything on your own , and the moment you do , you ’re screwed .
I became quite frustrated with Jim at one point for charging off on his own , and then having to shoot Hunters off him after he got himself pinned down before everyone was finished healing up , or whatever .
( I ’ll add here that I ’m far more irritating to play with than Jim , for all manner of reasons ) .
Later on , after a few more hours of play , Jim said , “ I ’m starting to get anxiety whenever I ’m away from the group ! ”
That ’s really it .
You ’re a team of four , and you must think that way .
Three of the “ special ” zombies – the Boomer ( giant fatty who vomits on you , and explodes when shot ) , the Hunter ( incredibly fast and vicious , able to leap huge distances and pin you to the ground ) , and the Smoker ( his metres - long tongue snatches you from the pack and drags you away ) – all emphasise the necessity for only teamwork .
Each incapacitates you , rendering you helpless , utterly dependent upon your team .
None are difficult to kill when not being attacked by them , so you must constantly look out for each other , having each other ’s backs .
Blimey , it ’s a lot of fun .
And we ’ve yet to touch the Versus mode .
Last night , as soon as I shut my eyes , I saw dozens of zombies clambering over fences , up buildings , and rushing toward me .
I dreamt exclusively of zombies .
And today I ’ll be mostly fighting zombies .
Zombies .
Brain gone .
Zombies .
Jim : I ’ve always been keen to place multiplayer games above single player games .
For every compelling , isolated drama I experience with solo - gaming , it seems like I have a dozen more anecdote - worthy incidents when other human brains are involved in the ludic mix .
Those pink apes that live all around us are excellent allies and opponents in our imaginary exploits .
However , and I ’ve yammered unwholesomely about this elsewhere , it ’s often great to be able to share co-operative adventures with your chums , and Left4 Dead is one such playground for partnership .
The entire game is bent on co-operation : you must save your chums , and stay close , so that they might save you .
Alone , you die .
That alone sets it apart and , for me at least , pops it on a little pedestal .
It ’s doing the kind of stuff I really value in gaming .
My main concern for L4D is that people still do n’t seem to quite know what the game is about .
You assume you know what a zombie game means , and then you play this …
The demo should abolish that , of course , and I expect there to be a clamouring of exploded expectations in its wake .
Left 4
Dead is remarkably immediate and familiar , and yet distinctly unlike other games .
There ’s a whiff of Half - Life ’s greatest mods to it , which I guess is hardly surprising when you see the people that Valve now employ .
That whiff is a taste of the meme - pool of experienced PC gamers who are building the kinds of games that extrapolate from our FPS heritage .
I know it works a blinder on Xbox too , but this feels and smells like a profoundly PC game .
That said , I ’m finding it tough to draw useful parallels with other game experiences .
It is , of course , nothing like any other classic zombie game out there .
It ’s survival horror without being anything like other games that are so toe - tagged .
And the replayed , randomised nature of the four hour - or - so maps mean that it ’s also nothing like other FPS games .
It ’s reminding me , ever so faintly , of Hired Guns – that proto - FPS of the Dungeon Master ilk – four characters against the horrors .
Only I never managed to get more than two people around a game of that .
This time we are faced with the absolute ideal situation of having the four RPS editors all playing together in the same room .
John really does squeal when the badguys come .
The most enjoyable aspect of all this , so far , has been the capacity for the game to go terrifyinglu wayward .
You think you ’re handling the zombie horde and then suddenly a molotov is thrown , or a cannister explodes , and everything is swathed in flame .
Or someone is caught by the lasso - tongued smoker zombie and dragged off to their doom as the survivors flail about in panic .
Or a witch is startled and sent screaming towards us .
Or… well , you ’ll get the idea soon enough .
Kieron : Stupid things first :
It was only when the game was starting did I realise the “ 4 ” in Left 4 dead was n’t just Nothing Compares 2 U -isms , but a reference to the four players .
One of the smartest voices in games journalism , me .
More stupid things second : BAMBAMBAMBAM !
That ’s the thing with Left 4 Dead .
There really is a lot of shooting .
I mean , you play most of the four - player co-op things that are around , and it ’s really just the standard modern approach to the genre .
As in , the fights are about 2:1 odds in their favour at the best , and it ’s based around choosing your shots and similar .
Left 4
Dead is n’t like that .
The thing I ’d immediately reach for is the original Doom – as in , it ’s a horror action game with the tension interrupted with moments of ludicrous intensity .
Or – more accurately – the ludicrous intensity interrupted with moments of tension .
Alec ’s response to the game – re-naming his character BAMBAMBAMBAM ! is the correct and measured response .
It ’s also like Doom in other ways bar its sheer aggression – it ’s based around a small yet iconic cast of characters .
Within the first hour , we ’d got a handle on all of the bad guys and learned the correct response – in my case , swearing profusely when half of them even slightly appear and calling the Boomers Fatties much to John ’s disgust .
But there ’s more subtlety going on than you may expect – when you get the scores at the end of each section , I tended to top the amount of damage to Tanks by a large margin .
That ’s because I think I ’ve worked out a way to actually hurt them which others have n’t quite got yet … but I ’m not going to spoil you .
Yet , anyway .
( The Tanks provide some of the game ’s most hilarious elements of Drama .
Alec lobbing a Molotov cocktail at one when he ’s in a small room with us , leading to in a fiery deathtrap with eight tons of angry muscle .
Similarly later , when I ’m last man standing , with a single health point and trying to take one down with a pistol .
And then there ’s the Witches and … )
Okay – the way which it is n’t like Doom is what pleases me most .
That it ’s not a Doom Tribute – it ’s a thoroughly modern game .
When I first played Left 4 Dead almost two years back , I was the person least impressed I knew – I thought it felt kind of retro .
Elements like climbing ladders did n’t seem to have proper animation on them and it was basically just people running at you .
Not true anymore .
Or , at least , not true any more in any way which matters .
The standard infected run is totally a next - generation futurist run .
There ’s a sense of momentum to them which I have n’t seen in the medium before – it ’s best shown when they manage to flank you , and a half dozen burst from the tree - line en masse .
Their run animation is particularly a marvel – catching one when they run in a parabolic arc , curving towards you is totally convincing .
Seeing them clamber .
Seeing them – best of all – get shot , with you catching a limb and them tumbling , their mass and speed carrying them onwards .
( Note to all : At least on normal , you ca n’t beat the autoshotgun . )
But the key element which makes this more progressive than you think is the Director , which – especially as you amp up the difficulty – manages to capture in a fluid way essential parts of the genre .
Over breakfast yesterday – before playing – we were talking about different takes on the zombie game that we ’d like to see .
One which did n’t come up is one which Left 4 Dead grasps completely – its inherent perverseness .
Now , it ’s a constant internet thing to discuss what you ’d do in a Zombie Invasion , the implication being that you ’re smarter than anyone else .
Which is fine … but that ’s not how the genre works .
The genre is based on that response , and proving it to be hubris .
So doing really sensible yet boring actions is going to get you killed .
Push on to reach the next safe room at all costs .
Because frankly , going back at any time is just going to get the director angry with you .
One section when we found ourselves stuck , we sent on one person ahead to gather a mob , with all three of us on a high place where they wo n’t be able to reach us easily .
This is when the Director decides to send the wave of undead from behind us .
Which is n’t saying there is n’t any way to play well .
But your plans will go wrong drastically , and you ’ll be forced to improvise – by which I mean screaming BAMBAMBAMBAM !
a lot while running around .
At least at this initial play , anyway .
So – very excited by it .
Looking forward to going back and playing Versus mode and seeing how it holds up single player today .
( I ’m thinking the other comparison I ’d make to it is actually old Bitmap ’s classic The Chaos Engine – when a player drops out , the seamless taking over by the computer works terrbly well .
When I did , the rest of RPS decided they ’d rather have the computer along rather than me .
The Bast ! )
You will also spend more than your usual your time swearing at friends .
As is only right .
It is a Zombie game , after all .
Alec :
It began with jokes and with songs .
There have been a lot of songs during our time in Seattle , the manic result of too little sleep and too much booze .
But , y’know , we really should n’t have been singing in the midst of a zombie invasion .
The singing stopped when we pushed the difficulty up a notch , convinced that we were absolute masters of Normal Mode .
Despite Director ’s uncanny magic , I ’d been a little concerned as to L4D ’s replayability .
The difficulty is as important to squeezing new ( un ) life out of familiar maps as is the random - o- matic element .
Suddenly , we were n’t The Disharmonious Beatles stumbling through zany adventures with a smile on our faces and a song in our heart , but we were the self - interested , short - tempered cast of Night of The Living Dead and so many of its successors .
That is to say , we were n’t friendly .
We did n’t trust each other , we swore at each other , we blamed one another for everything from getting in the way to using a less appropriate weapon to stealing health packs .
We were working together out of necessity , not amicability .
No singing , and not even much BAMBAMBAMBAM .
The thing with the difficulty is n’t so much that it drops more zombies onto you – I ’m not even sure it does – or even that their hitpoints go up , but more that the Special enemies are far more frequent .
L4D has , outside of common or garden high - speed deaders :
Fat Blokes – Boomers , explodey and vomity meatsacks .
Players caught in the blast / vomit radius become a great big beacon for a huge , bonus of wave of zombies Tongue Blokes – Smokers , whose enormous mouth - snakes can grab a player from a good forty metres away , rendering him helpless until his mates save him Fast Blokes ( the hyper - fast , pouncing Hunters , who ’ll pin a player to the ground , again until a chum intervenes Creepy Singing Ladies – Witches , who remain motionless until disturbed by light , noise or an errant gunshot .
Their eerie song and simultaneous sobbing are by far the most terrifying thing in the game .
Upon waking up , they ’re a whirling dervish of destruction .
Fight every instinct to shoot the apparently frail things and sneak around them .
C*nts – the enormous , heavily armoured Tanks , who you can hear stomping towards you from about half a mile away .
On Normal , they ’ll fall over before they do too much damage .
On Advanced , their hitpoints are such that we ’d always be three men down and the last backed into a corner desperately letting off pistol shots within moments of encountering one .
A Tank is the shortest route to an endgame situation .
Well , apart from one thing .
In Normal you tend to encounter only one of these a time , and they were n’t too harrowing .
In Advanced , we ’d regularly hit situations such as someone being dragged off by a Tongue Bloke , his theoretical rescuer finding himself floored by a Fast Bloke , and the other two fending off 60 zombies that had just turned up as a result of a Fat Bloke being sick on them .
Facing multiple specials at once is high trauma and a monstrous challenge – and one , interestingly , that I think can only be mastered to a certain extent .
Being a master of the headshot is one thing , but the tactical thinking , reflex and pure luck necessary to stay alive in the face of genuinely overwhelming odds is another .
There is another difficulty level yet .
And that ’s my challenge for , probably , the rest of the year .
Right now , I ca n’t even imagine beating it .
Dear God but I intend to try , however .
Forty years ago this Christmas the first human beings reached the moon .
But their historic feat is better remembered for an image of what they left behind - planet Earth .
Looking back from more than 200,000 miles away , the crew of Apollo 8 saw Earth floating " like a Christmas tree ornament lit up in space , fragile - looking " .
They pointed their cameras through smeared porthole windows and began snapping .
It seems almost incredible now , but nobody thought to take a photo of Earth until they saw it , because nobody had seen it before .
One of those photos , an Earthrise over the grey and inhospitable lunar horizon , has become one of the most reproduced and recognised pictures of our planet .
LIFE magazine selected it as one of 100 photographs that changed the world ; more recently it featured in an Oscar - winning film about climate change , An Inconvenient Truth .
" That one picture exploded in the consciousness of humans , " said Al Gore , the film 's Nobel prize - winning narrator and campaigner .
" It led to dramatic changes .
Within 18 months of this picture the environment movement had begun . "
There is still some dispute over which of Apollo 8's crew took the first Earthrise photo , but the official version selected by the American space agency , Nasa , was by Bill Anders , who spoke to the Guardian from his home in San Diego , California .
" After all the training and studying we 'd done as pilots and engineers to get to the moon safely and get back , [ and ] as human beings to explore moon orbit , " he said , " what we really discovered was the planet Earth . "
Anders and fellow crew members Frank Borman and Jim Lovell left on December 21 and began orbiting the moon on Christmas Eve .
For the first and second loops , Apollo 8 's crew faced backwards , but on the third revolution Borman , the commander , turned their capsule around .
" Suddenly Borman said something like ' look at that ' and here was the Earth coming up , " recalled Anders .
" There was a mad scramble for cameras : I just happened to have one with colour film in it and a long lens .
All I did was to keep snapping .
" It 's not a very good photo as photos go , but it 's a special one .
It was the first statement of our planet Earth and it was particularly impressive because it 's contrasted against this startling horizon . "
In the following weeks it is estimated that 2 billion people - more than half the humans alive at the time - watched the blurred black and grey TV film of the moon and listened to crackling voices speaking to them across space as Apollo 8's crew read the first 10 verses of the Bible .
In what now seems symbolic of the impact of seeing the whole planet for the first time with human eyes , Borman appeared to cast off the nationalistic cold war fervour surrounding the mission and ended the broadcast saying : " A merry Christmas and God bless all of you , all of you on the good Earth . "
The impact of the photo in 1968 was immediate in a world already shaken by Rachel Carson 's explosive book on pesticide pollution , Silent Spring .
Four decades later , climate change is the great environmental threat and Earthrise is still used by campaigners trying to draw attention to the problem .
Landscape photographer Joe Cornish said he had been haunted by the image : " It 's a new perspective from space , but it 's a totally new perspective when you see it in relation to another body in space . "
For Anders , the fragility of life on Earth is shown even more powerfully by three photos of the Earth alone in space : " Earthrise has a reference - there 's the moon and the Earth , you do n't get a vastness - whereas the other ones , particularly the smaller one , it 's Earth and black to the frame ... it goes on and on . "
He added : " I think it 's important for people to understand they are just going around on one of the smaller grains of sand on one of the spiral arms of this kind of puny galaxy ... it [ Earth ] is insignificant , but it 's the only one we 've got . "
It has been a hard year for the biggest Swiss bank , UBS .
After losing millions in the US sub - prime mortgage market , it has had to beg the Swiss government for help .
As Imogen Foulkes reports , its reputation in Switzerland may never recover .
Swiss shareholders are angry that the value of their shares has plummeted In Zurich , UBS head office sits astride Paradeplatz - Parade Square to you and me .
But in recent months , the Swiss have renamed it Piratenplatz - or Pirate Square - to signify what they believe is the daylight robbery that has taken place over the last 12 months .
Not of their biggest bank , but by it .
When the news began to trickle out that UBS was in big trouble because of its exposure to sub - prime mortgages , there was first surprise , then concern , and then finally , as the multi-billion pound extent of the losses became clear , fury .
I remember going to an emergency shareholders meeting earlier this year .
Touch their money and the Swiss get mad
Bernhard Weissberg
Blick newspaper UBS has thousands of small shareholders , mostly relatively well - off , mostly elderly , and none of them expecting the value of their shares to be cut in half in a few short months .
Huge bonuses I watched as greying heads bent over the agenda and as mutterings of irritation turned to angry comments .
By the time the 6,000 strong crowd were seated , the mood was decidedly tense .
" We know of course that investing money is a risk , but we did n't expect this .
Now we want to know who was responsible , " said Roby Tschopp , spokesman for one of the shareholder groups .
Well , those responsible were plain to see - a phalanx of UBS chief executives in expensive suits , on a raised dais , bathed in spotlights .
It was not the best public relations image .
The Swiss know that UBS bosses earned among the highest salaries in Europe .
Added to that were huge bonuses which they continued to award themselves even as the financial crisis unfolded .
It was all too much for one indignant shareholder .
Leaping to the podium he turned to UBS chairman Marcel Ospel and told him " give back your fat bonus , now " .
Food for thought Mr Ospel declined to return what was rumoured to be a very generous bonus " Here , just in case you go hungry , I 've brought you something to eat , " he continued .
And reaching into his pocket he produced a string of traditional Swiss sausages and waved them under Mr Ospel 's trembling nose .
It was an unforgettable moment , and shows just why the Swiss are so angry .
This may be a wealthy country now , but Switzerland endured famine in the 19th century , and those hard times remain in the collective memory .
Most Swiss are extremely cautious - they hate the idea of money for nothing , let alone the idea of earning millions while making billion pound mistakes .
" Touch their money and the Swiss get mad , " says Bernhard Weissberg , editor of the mass circulation Blick newspaper .
He should know , his desk is piled high with readers ' letters that are so angry you can almost see them smouldering .
" UBS bosses , " writes one reader , " give us our money back , or we 'll feed you to the crocodiles . "
That is enough to make the residents of Pirate Square nervous - but UBS bosses do not seem to be able to turn their ship around .
Betrayal Management assurances that the bank was on the road to recovery were swiftly followed by a £ 40 bn ( $ 60 bn ) rescue package from the government , available to all Swiss banks .
This caused more fury among taxpayers .
UBS was once renowned world - wide for its caution and reliability Marcel Ospel stepped down as chairman , and a new pay structure with fewer bonuses was announced .
But Mr Ospel has so far declined to return the rumoured £ 10 m bonus he received last year .
" I think ordinary Swiss feel betrayed by UBS , " banking analyst Hans Geiger says .
It was special to us , it controls 25 % of the domestic banking market , which is huge . "
" We believed that UBS had the best risk managers and it turned out the opposite was true , " he adds .
So , like spurned lovers , the Swiss are taking their affection elsewhere .
At least £ 70 bn have been removed from UBS over the last year .
' American invention '
The bank is haemorrhaging money , and smaller local banks are doing a roaring trade .
Those mild mannered pensioners may have included some crocodiles in their pockets , along with the sausages
One of those who has closed his account is Thomas Minder , the manager of a small but successful business .
He regards UBS 's catastrophic investment in sub - prime mortgages as deeply un -Swiss .
" The whole sub - prime thing is an American invention , " he says in a disgusted tone , " but a Swiss bank got involved . "
And so , like the patriot he is , Mr Minder has embarked on a truly Swiss course of action to prevent such excesses in the future .
Using Switzerland 's system of direct democracy , he has collected the required 100,000 signatures to hold a nationwide referendum to end , as he puts it , " the corporate rip off . "
His proposal would forbid golden handshakes , bonuses would be performance related , and excessive salaries banned .
Perhaps luckily for Swiss business leaders , it will be a year or so before this goes to the vote - because given the current national mood , if the polling stations opened tomorrow , Mr Minder 's idea would be a shoo in .
In the meantime though , UBS 's piratical top brass have another ordeal to face - Thursday 's extraordinary shareholders ' meeting - and this time those mild mannered pensioners may have included some crocodiles in their pockets , along with the sausages .

So who ’s a real American now ?
With his decisive triumph over Senator John McCain , Senate Barack Obama made obvious history : he is the first black ( or biracial ) man to win the presidency .
But the meaning of his victory –in which Obama splashed blue across previously red states –extends far beyond its racial significance .
Obama , a former community organizer and law professor , won the White House as one of the most progressive ( or liberal ) nominees in the Democratic Party ’s recent history .
Mounting one of the best run presidential bids in decades , Obama tied his support for progressive positions ( taxing the wealthy to pay for tax cuts for working Americans , addressing global warming , expanding affordable health insurance , withdrawing troops from Iraq ) to calls for cleaning up Washington and for crafting a new type of politics .
Charismatic , steady , and confident , he melded substance and style into a winning mix that could be summed up in simple and basic terms : hope and change .
After nearly eight years of George W. Bush ’s presidency , Obama was the non-Bush : intelligent , curious , thoughtful , deliberate , and competent .
His personal narrative–he was the product of an unconventional family and worked his way into the nation ’s governing class–fueled his campaign narrative .
His story was the American Dream v2.0 .
He was change , at least at skin level .
But he also championed the end of Bushism .
He had opposed the Iraq war .
He had opposed Bush ’s tax cuts for the rich .
He was no advocate of let - ‘er-rip , free market capitalism or American unilateralism .
In policy terms , Obama represents a serious course correction .
And more .
In the general election campaign , McCain and his running mate , Sarah Palin , turned the fight for the presidency into a culture clash .
They accused Obama of being a socialist .
They assailed him for having associated with William Ayers , a former , bomb - throwing Weather Underground radical , who has since become an education expert .
Palin indirectly referred to Obama ’s relationship with the Reverend Jeremiah Wright , who once preached fiery sermons denouncing the United States government for certain policies .
On the campaign trail , Palin suggested there were “ real ” parts of America and fake parts .
At campaign events , she promoted a combative , black - helicopter version of conservatism : if you ’re for government expansion , you ’re against freedom .
During her one debate with Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden , she hinted that if her opponents won the White House there might come a day when kids would ask their grandparents what it had been like to live in a free country .
At McCain - Palin rallies , supporters shouted out , “ Communist ! ” and “ terrorist ! ” and “ Muslim ! ” when the Republican candidates referred to Obama .
And McCain and Palin hurled the standard charges at Obama : he will raise your taxes and he is weak on national security .
Put it all together and the message was clear : there are two types of Americans .
Those who are true Americans –who love their nation and cherish freedom–and those who are not .
The other Americans do not put their country first ; they blame it first .
The other Americans do not believe in opportunity ; they want to take what you have and give it to someone else .
The other Americans do not care about Joe the Plumber ; they are out - of - touch elitists who look down on ( and laugh at ) hard - working , church - going folks .
The other Americans do not get the idea of America .
They are not patriots .
And it just so happens that the other America is full of blacks , Latinos , gays , lesbians , and non-Christians .
McCain , Palin and their compatriots did what they could to depict Obama as the rebel chief of this other un-American America .
( Hillary Clinton helped set up their effort during the primaries by beating the Ayers drum . )
Remember the stories of Obama ’s supposed refusal to wear a flag pin or place his hand over his heart for the Pledge of Allegiance ?
The emails about Obama being a secret Muslim ?
The goal was to delegitimize Obama , as well as the Americans who were moved by his biography , his rhetoric , and his ideas .
It was back to the 1960s –drawing a harsh line between the squares ( the real Americans ) and the freaks ( those redistribution - loving , terrorist - coddling faux Americans ) .
It did n’t work .
With the nation mired in two wars and beset by a financial crisis , Obama mobilized a diverse coalition that included committed Democratic liberals turned on by his policy stands ( unabashed redistributionists , no doubt ) and less ideologically - minded voters jazzed by his temperament , meta - themes , and come - together message .
He showed that the old Republican attack tactics do not always draw blood .
A candidate could advocate raising taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations and withstand being called a socialist .
A candidate could advocate talking to the nation ’s enemies and withstand being tagged weak and dangerous .
A candidate could be non-white , have an odd name , boast a less - than - usual ancestry , be an unrepentant Ivy Leaguer , profess a quiet and thoughtful patriotism ( that encompasses both love and criticism of country ) , and still be a real American .
And become president .
How He Did It —
The Primaries
From the start of the campaign , Obama and his advisers–notably campaign manager David Plouffe and chief strategist David Axelrod–shared a vision of how a freshman senator with relatively little national experience could reach the White House .
Obama presented himself as an agent of change leading a movement for change .
Given that a large majority of the voters believed the nation was heading in the wrong direction after two terms of George W. Bush , this was not the most brilliant of strategic strokes .
But Obama had the chops to pull it off .
He spoke well , he conveyed intelligence and energy , and he advocated policies that seemed like an antidote to the Bush years .
And he effectively matched his own personal story ( a best - selling book ! ) to this message of renewal .
Throughout the primaries , Obama addressed the sense of disenfranchisement Democrats and independents ( and even some Republicans ) had experienced during the W years .
As these citizens watched Bush and Dick Cheney dole out tax cuts to the wealthy , do nothing about global warming , launch an optional war in Iraq , and expand secrecy and executive power , many felt locked out .
It did n’t help that Bush and his crowd appeared dismissive of those who disagreed with them , decrying elitism and playing to conservative know - nothingism .
Obama came along and invited primary voters to join a crusade for change –which meant a crusade against them .
It was a chance to strike back against the empire .
Obama understood the need of many to reclaim their country .
The right has often exploited such a sentiment .
Think of the rise of the Moral Majority .
But Obama was not playing the resentment card .
Crucial to his success was Obama ’s decision to keep anger ( at least his own ) out of the equation .
For him and his supporters , there was cause to be damn mad .
From their perspective , the country had been hijacked by Bush , Cheney and a small band of neocons .
( A view they could hold with much justification . )
But Obama appeared to have made a calculation : an angry black man could not win over a majority of the voters .
He offered voters not fury , but hope .
And considering his “ improbable ” –as he put it–rise , he was a natural pitchman for hope .
Fixating on hope allowed him to talk about the problems of the United States ( past and present ) while remaining an optimist .
Americans tend not to elect purveyors of doom and gloom to the presidency .
Usually the candidate with the sunnier disposition wins .
It ’s not hard to fathom why .
When Americans select a president , many are voting for the person who they believe best reflects their own idea of America .
Voting for president has a strong psychological component .
It ’s how Americans define their nation .
So personal attributes –character , strength , biography , personality–are important .
Obama described his presidential bid not as a campaign of outrage but as a cause of hope–a continuation of the grand and successful progressive movements of the past .
For Democratic voters , he had the appropriate liberal policy stances .
He had a record as a reformer in the Illinois state senate and the US Senate .
But he provided more than resumé ; he served up inspiration .
Obama could advocate these policies –policies that often stir sharp partisan fights in Washington and beyond–and at the same time convincingly call for a new politics of productivity ( not partisanship ) in Washington .
This took some talent .
Mark Schmitt credits what he calls Obama ’s “ communitarian populism ” –a quiet , inclusive populism .
Leave your pitchforks at the door .
This message and his manner of delivering it led many Democratic voters to conclude that he was the right man for the post - Bush cleanup .
Obama had one big obstacle in the primaries : Hillary Clinton .
She had a brand name that attracted and repulsed voters .
She ran a conventional campaign .
She uttered no talk of any movement .
She relied on her resumé , and said she was ready to roll up her sleeves and work for you .
Will you hire me as your advocate - in - chief ?
she asked .
Obama was offering music ; she was offering math .
It was virtually a toss - up for the Democratic electorate .
What made the difference was that Obama , the heady candidate , managed his campaign more effectively than Clinton , the down - to - earth candidate , managed hers .
Clinton and her crew , after losing in Iowa and then fighting back in New Hampshire , botched the middle stretch and allowed Obama to rack up a series of wins that did give him–oh , that dreadful word –momentum .
More important , her campaign seemed to bounce from one strategy to the next , as infighting roiled Clintonland .
Not until the end of the primaries did Clinton get her groove back , winning over blue - collar voters in once - industrial states as the scrappy working - class hero .
But it was too late .
The delegate math became undeniable .
In beating Clinton , Obama showed that he had assembled a disciplined and skilled campaign staff .
Not once was his campaign rocked by internal dissension .
It never went through a staff shakeup .
There were no media stories , relying on unnamed sources , revealing major disputes or fundamental disagreements at Obama HQ .
( “ We had our disagreements , ” says one top Obama aide .
“ But they were always within the confines of getting to the best decision .
I was stunned by how well it all worked . ” )
Consensus , smooth operations , no signs of turf fights or ego battles –this is virtually unheard of in a major modern presidential campaigns .
Obama even handled his flip - flops–voting for the telecom immunity bill after vowing not to and opting out of public financing system after indicating he would remain within it–relatively well .
The operation of his campaign sent a signal : Obama was a serious person who could ably handle pressure .
Obama preached hope and at the same time he was the CEO of a well - managed enterprise that would raise and spend ( in record amounts ) hundreds of millions of dollars .
How He Did It – The General Election
Once it became clear that Obama and McCain would each be the presidential nominee of their respective parties , they faced two big tests –selecting a running mate and addressing the financial meltdown .
Obama passed both ; McCain failed both .
Obama ’s choice of Biden was not inspiring .
It was , in a way , a conventional pick , a safe bet ( relatively safe , given Biden ’s penchant for verbal slip - ups ) .
Obama ’s campaign was predicated on the promise he would shake up Washington .
Biden , a three - decade veteran of the Senate , was not known as a rebel .
But he had deep foreign policy experience and had spent years courting the working - class voters of Delaware .
He could reassure voters worried that Obama had not spent enough years toiling on national security matters .
And Biden certainly would not compete with Obama for headlines and screen time .
Obama was the inspiration on the ticket .
Biden was the insurance policy .
By going with Biden , Obama dared to be boring and indicated he was willing to play it straight when necessary .
He abided by the first rule of veep selection : do no harm .
McCain took another route .
He gambled .
He picked a governor little - known on the national stage–a woman whom even McCain barely knew .
It gave his campaign a shot of excitement and surprise .
Her performance at the Republican convention was dazzling .
But this high did not last , as Palin did miserably in media interviews .
Several conservative columnists had to admit she was not ready for prime time .
Within weeks , McCain ’s act of daring was widely perceived as an act of recklessness .
Her approval ratings plummeted .
Polls indicated she was a drag on a ticket and a prominent reason why some voters were not favoring McCain .
Palin was strike one .
Strike two was McCain ’s erratic response to the financial crisis–saying different things , deciding to suspend his campaign but then suspending the suspension .
His actions reinforced the impression created by the Palin misstep : he likes to shoot from the hip .
But with the economy and Wall Street in a free fall , many voters were probably not eager for another cowboy president .
Meanwhile , Obama , who met with establishment advisers and calmly backed the $ 700 billion bailout ( which McCain also endorsed ) , looked like the adult in the room that crucial week , which culminated in the first debate .
That face - off , according to the insta-polls , was a win for Obama , as were the next two confrontations .
Weeks into the general election , Obama had made a pivot–but so smoothly that most of the politerati did not even see it .
He had gone from the inspiring movement leader calling for wholesale change in Washington to a reassuring figure who demonstrated that he could play well with the establishment .
The younger and less experienced of the two nominees seemed better suited to handle a crisis .
Iraq and national security were no longer the issues ; the economy was .
And Obama showed he possessed the steadier hand .
At the final debate , as McCain jabbed with punches that packed not much punch , Obama came across as confident if not so dynamic .
But when the world is cracking up , who wants pizzazz ?
Losing on the economy front–and in the temperament contest–McCain , with Palin acting like his gun moll , stepped up his use of the standard GOP attack lines .
He went back to basics .
Obama , he contended , yearned to raise taxes not just on the rich but on everybody .
Even though independent experts had concluded that middle - class voters would receive a bigger tax cut under Obama ’s proposal than McCain ’s , the McCain camp kept issuing charges about Obama ’s tax aims that were not true .
They found a mascot in Joe the Plumber ( who was not really named Joe and not really a plumber ) .
And they whipped up the old tax - and - spend fear about Democrats .
“ Now is no the time to experiment with socialism , ” Palin exclaimed at rallies , ignoring the fact that she presides over the socialistic state of Alaska ( which redistributes tax revenues collected from oil companies to the state ’s citizens ) .
She dubbed Obama “ Barack the Wealth Spreader . ”
At a McCain rally near St. Louis , Representative Todd Akin ( R - MO ) said , “ This campaign in the next couple of weeks is about one thing .
It ’s a referendum on socialism . ”
Senator George Voinovich ( R - OH ) weighed in on Obama : “ With all due respect , the man is a socialist . ”
McCain repeatedly referred to Obama as the “ redistributionist - in- chief , ” often stumbling over the phrase .
He must have forgotten that during a 2000 campaign event , he was asked , “ Are we getting closer and closer to , like , socialism , ” and McCain replied , “ Here ’s what I really believe :
That when you reach a certain level of comfort , there ’s nothing wrong with paying somewhat more . ”
It was an anti-intellectual attack–taxes equals socialism–ignoring basic facts and the personal history of McCain ( who was roundly accused by conservatives of engaging in “ class warfare ” in 2000 when he opposed George W. Bush ’s tax cuts for the rich ) .
The point was to strike fear into the hearts of voters who make far less money than Obama ’s proposed threshold for tax hikes .
McCain was not appealing to the better nature of voters .
Putting up a fierce fight , Obama did not make it personal .
He paid tribute to McCain ’s military service .
But he slammed McCain for standing with Bush on economic issues .
“ If you want to know where Senator McCain will drive this economy , just look in the rearview mirror , ” Obama told campaign audiences .
And he challenged the Big Idea of the Republican Party :
The last thing we can afford is four more years of the tired , old theory that says we should give more to billionaires and big corporations and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else .
The last thing we can afford is four more years where no one in Washington is watching anyone on Wall Street because politicians and lobbyists killed common - sense regulations .
Those are the theories that got us into this mess .
They have n’t worked , and it ’s time for change .
Obama was n’t just taking on Bushism .
He was taking on Reaganism .
McCain , Palin , and their supporters did make it personal .
They claimed that Obama was misleading the voters , that he was not what he seemed .
They argued that he was not up to the job .
The McCain - Palin campaign ran a series of ads–one falsely asserted that Obama had supported teaching kindergartners “ comprehensive sex education ” –that various MSM outlets pronounced untruthful and unfair .
The Straight Talk Express was derided as a cavalcade of misrepresentation .
The McCain - Palin campaign revived the Bill Ayers attack .
It tried to brand Obama an associate of anti-Semites , pointing to his relationship with a Palestinian scholar –without producing evidence that this Palestinian was anti-Semitic .
( The International Republican Institute , a group chaired by McCain , had given over $ 400,000 to a group co-founded by this scholar . )
It was an ugly assault .
Speaking in support of McCain and Palin , Representative Robin Hayes ( R - NC ) declared , “ Liberals hate real Americans that work , and accomplish , and achieve , and believe in God . ” McCain supporters referred to Obama as “ Barack Hussein Obama . ”
At a Palin rally , Representative Steve King ( R - IA ) said that an Obama victory would cause the United States to turn into a “ totalitarian dictatorship . ”
Representative Michele Bachmann ( R - MN ) declared that Obama was “ anti-American . ”
While she was at it , she urged the media to investigate and root out anti-Americanism within the US Congress .
This mud did not stick .
Perhaps worse for McCain , his camp never presented a coherent strategic argument for its candidate .
Obama had change and hope .
McCain had no real case for McCain–other than he was a POW who put his country first .
What did he want to do as president ?
Serve his country again .
He essentially asked to be rewarded for his past service and sacrifice .
He did n’t feel the voters ’ pain ; he wanted them to feel his .
And his campaign ended up being defined mostly by its retro attack on Obama : he ’s an untested and untrustworthy liberal .
Most of the voters disagreed .
With his victory , Obama has ended the Bush II era with an exclamation point .
( The Democratic gains in Congress seconded the point . )
Now Obama faces a restoration project of unprecedented proportions .
It may take years for him and the rest of Washington to remedy the ills neglected , exacerbated or caused by the Bush presidency .
And he will have a tough time matching progress to promise .
At his victory celebration in Chicago before tens of thousands , he lowered expectations : “ the road ahead will be long .
The climb ahead will be steep . ”
And he noted that his electoral victory merely provided “ only the chance for us to make that change . ”
But his barrier - breaking victory was indeed change in itself .
Consider this : Obama ended his campaign at a rally on Monday night in Manassas , Virginia , the site of Battle of Bull Run , the opening land battle of the Civil War , in which Union troops were routed and forced to retreat back to Washington , DC There before a crowd of 90,000 – young , old , black , white , affluent , working - class – Obama summed up his case :
Tomorrow , you can turn the page on policies that have put greed and irresponsibility before hard work and sacrifice .
Tomorrow , you can choose policies that invest in our middle class and create new jobs , grow this economy so everybody has a chance to succeed , not just the CEO but the secretary and the janitor , not just the factory owner but the men and women who work the factory floors .
And tomorrow , you can end to the politics that would divide a nation just to win an election , that pits region against region , city against town , Republican against Democrat , that asks us to fear at a time when we need to hope .
A black man on the verge of being elected president said that .
But race is just one part of the tale .
Obama has done more than become a first .
He has redrawn the electoral map ( take that , Karl Rove ) and reshaped the political culture of the United States .
He has transformed the image of the United States–abroad and at home .
( He vowed in Chicago that “ a new dawn of American leadership is at hand . ” )
Above all , after eight troubling years and after decades of ideological civil war , Obama has redefined what is real America .
“ Who knew that we were the Silent Majority ? ” his press secretary Linda Douglass said moments after Obama left the stage in Grant Park .
The voters who see President - elect Obama as the embodiment of their America can trade the Yes We Can motto for a new one : Yes We Are .
Trash has crashed .
The economic downturn has decimated the market for recycled materials like cardboard , plastic , newspaper and metals .
Across the country , this junk is accumulating by the ton in the yards and warehouses of recycling contractors , which are unable to find buyers or are unwilling to sell at rock - bottom prices .
Ordinarily the material would be turned into products like car parts , book covers and boxes for electronics .
But with the slump in the scrap market , a trickle is starting to head for landfills instead of a second life .
“ It ’s awful , ” said Briana Sternberg , education and outreach coordinator for Sedona Recycles , a nonprofit group in Arizona that recently stopped taking certain types of cardboard , like old cereal , rice and pasta boxes .
There is no market for these , and the organization ’s quarter - acre yard is already packed fence to fence .
“ Either it goes to landfill or it begins to cost us money , ” Ms. Sternberg said .
In West Virginia , an official of Kanawha County , which includes Charleston , the state capital , has called on residents to stockpile their own plastic and metals , which the county mostly stopped taking on Friday .
In eastern Pennsylvania , the small town of Frackville recently suspended its recycling program when it became cheaper to dump than to recycle .
In Montana , a recycler near Yellowstone National Park no longer takes anything but cardboard .
I saw soooooooo many Joker costumes while I was at Nekocon this weekend .
Some where good , but most of them were not .
Some were just bad lipstick on their faces .
I was n’t sure if they were trying to be the Joker or Steve Buscemi ’s character from Billy Madison .
Nonetheless , this is what popped into my mind while seeing them .
Told the idea that had popped into my head to a friend of mine and he groaned .
At that point I knew it was worth making a comic out of .
I had originally planned to run a sketch comic yesterday and then run a new Dueling Analogs today .
But this was a little more elaborate than just a sketch strip , so I changed it up a little .
As of right now , I ’m running this today ( obviously ) and I will run two new gaming themed comics on Wednesday and Friday this week .
I think that should work .
I also wanted to make sure that I mentioned the cool webcomic people I got to spend some time with this weekend : Ananth , Brian , Chris , Danny , Dave , Donnie , Garth , Mookie , Rich , Peekaboo and Yuko .
As well as some cool non-webcomic people too : Brendan , Dizzy , Jim , Nelly and Sako .
There were others , too .
But to the best of my knowledge they do n’t have URLs and I was too lazy and cheap to buy them for them .
Also , I really want to mention that I had an awesome time at Nekocon and they treated all the guests there like they were friggin’ Akira Toriyama .
It was just plain awesome .
Thanks again for having me and I ’m definitely looking forward to Nekocon 12 next year .
But way before then , I will see you guys on Wednesday !
現状のmemcachedのバイナリプロトコルのクライアント（=libmemcached）は、リクエストの順番通りにレスポンスが返ってくることを期待しており、これはmemcachedバイナリプロトコルを「汎用的なkey-valueベースの分散ストレージのためのプロトコル」として考えると、ひどい実装である。
そのような実装は最適化の余地を大幅に制限してしまい、性能とスケーラビリティが悪化する。memcachedの仕様書は、そのようなクライアントの実装はバグであると明示するべきである。
現状のmemcachedクライアントの実装の問題点と、その解決策について述べる。
同期プロトコルと非同期プロトコル
ネットワークプロトコルは以下の2つの種類に分けられる：
同期プロトコル リクエストの順番通りにレスポンスを返す（リクエストの順番とレスポンスの順番が同期している） 非同期プロトコル リクエストした順番通りにレスポンスが返ってくるとは限らない（リクエストの順番とレスポンスの順番が同期していない）
libmemcached はmemcachedのバイナリプロトコルを同期プロトコルとして扱っており、リクエストした順番通りにレスポンスが返ってくることを期待している。同期プロトコルを採用するとクライアント・サーバーのどちらもその実装方法が制限されてしまい、最適化の余地を減らしてしまう。
同期・非同期の違いは、リクエストをパイプライン化したときに発現する。
パイプライン化とは、リクエストを送ったあと、そのレスポンスを待たずに立て続けに次のリクエストを送ってしまうことである。複数のリクエストを送りたいとき、レスポンスを待たずに一度に送ることできるので、性能が向上する。
以下のようにクライアントがリクエストをパイプライン化して送信するとき、同期プロトコルではレスポンスはリクエストを送った順番通りに返ってくるが、非同期プロトコルでは順不同になる。
Synchronized protocol : Asynchronized protocol : send request 1 send request 1 send request 2 send request 2 send request 3 send request 3 receive response for request 1 receive response for request 2 receive response for request 2 receive response for request 3 receive response for request 3 receive response for request 1
The order of the responses is The order of the responses is NOT syncnhronized with the requests .
synchronized with the requests .
この例で 、request 1の処理は非常に時間のかかるもので、request 2の処理はすぐに終わるものだったとしよう。
同期プロトコルでパイプライン化を使ってrequest 1 とrequest 2を送信したとき、request 1の応答が返ってくるまでrequest 2の応答を得ることができない。つまりアプリケーションはrequest
1の処理が終わるまで長い時間待たないと、request 2に関する処理を継続することができない。
同期プロトコルでこの問題を回避するためには、パイプライン化を使わずに、request 1 とrequest 2を別々のコネクションで送れば良い。しかしコネクションを増やすとサーバーの負荷が増加してしまうため、結果としてスケーラビリティを悪化させる。
非同期プロトコルでは、パイプライン化してrequest 1 とrequest 2を送信しても、request 1にかかる処理時間にかかわらず、すぐにrequest 2の応答を得ることができる。
次にサーバーを実装することを考えてみる。
マルチコ アCPUが当然となっている現在では、マルチスレッドを使って複数のリクエストを同時に処理しなければ性能が向上しない。また1台のサーバーだけでは性能が不足するときは、複数のサーバーを使って複数のリクエストを同時に処理しなければ性能が向上しない。memcachedのバイナリプロトコルを汎用的なストレージプロトコルとして捉えると、memcachedを実装するのに十分であれば良いのではなく、そのような用途にも対応できる拡張性を備えているべきである。
リクエストの内容によってその処理にかかる時間は異なるため、先に受け取ったリクエストよりも、後に受け取ったリクエストの方が（別のスレッド・サーバーで処理された結果）先に終了することは大いに有り得る。
しかし同期プロトコルでは 、request 1 とrequest 2がパイプライン化されて送られてきたとき、request 2の処理が先に終わったとしても、サーバーはrequest 2に対する応答をrequest 1の処理が終わるまで保留させておかなければならない。これはサーバーの実装を複雑化させる原因となり、結果として性能を悪化させる。
非同期プロトコルでは、単に処理が終わった順に応答を返せばよい。
現状のmemcachedバイナリプロトコルの仕様書では非同期プロトコルであることが示されていないため、クライアント・サーバーの両方で最適化の余地を減らしてしまい、性能が悪くなる。
memcachedバイナリプロトコルは、同期プロトコルを禁止するべきである。

Fanedits are fan - created versions of officially available movies .
Fans spend huge amounts of time with sophisticated software to add , cut or alter scenes to improve the original or simply create different versions of a movie .
Fanedit.org is the largest such community in the world and the MPAA has , in the words of the admin , just ' castrated ' the site .
Faneditors consider what they do to be an artform .
Taking famous movies as a base , faneditors spend huge amounts of time editing with sophisticated software in order to create improved or just plain different versions of existing movies .
Most of the time , faneditors try to improve what is wrong or bad with a movie , using advanced techniques to create a new piece of art based on the original .
Of course , faneditors love to share their work with others in the community , something the movie industry wants to bring to an end .
In existence since 2006 , Fanedit.org is the world ’s biggest fanedit site and the people there clearly have a passion for what they do .
Visited by around 2000 people every day , members of the site have created dozens of new versions of existing movies such as sci- fi greats Alien , The Matrix , Terminator and Star Trek , and regular movies like Titanic , Harry Potter and Pulp Fiction .
However , things started to turn sour for the site recently .
Torrent Freak caught up with the admin of Fanedit.org , boon23 , for the lowdown .
TF : Please introduce yourself to the readers
boon23 : I am boon23 , faneditor and administrator of the biggest fanedits website in the world .
I ’m a preschool teacher from Europe and as faneditor I post under the name CBB ( created by boon ) and have so far created 29 fanedits , which is quite a lot .
It is my hobby , my art , the thing I really love to do and will continue to do .
TF : Tell us a little about fanediting .
boon23 : It ’s actually a bit like creating a mix music CD or deleting tracks from a music album , but even more like remixing music to your own liking .
Creating fanedits is a desire as old as movies themselves .
People love to make things more their own or enjoy a variation on the original .
TF : How long have people been sharing fanedits online ?
boon23 : The online sharing of fanedits started 2004 with the fanedit : The Phantom Edit , a fanedit by Mike Nichols based on The Phantom Menace ( SW Episode 1 ) .
It was shared millions of times , because people had such a big desire for a grown up version of that movie .
The latest incredibly successful fanedit is Adywan ’s Star Wars Revisited , which corrected every little flaw from the 2004 release of A New Hope .
New special effects , sharper image , better and corrected coloring , new and improved scenes , new music , additional and corrected sound effects .
It was created by one guy in 2 years , in which he did nothing else but work on this project .
Fanediting is strictly non commercial ( on fanedit.org ) .
We expect everyone interested in a fanedit to buy and own the original movie , have links for that on every page and ban and report everyone that tries to sell a fanedit .
With this we are trying to keep it as legal as possible .
TF : The MPAA do n’t like what happens on the site .
When did you first hear that they had the site in the cross -hairs ?
boon23 : Three days ago I heard for the first time from them through my webhost , who was contacted by them .
They filed a DMCA complaint and wanted two pages containing loads of Rapidshare download links removed .
They did not get into detail , or say which fanedits were concerned .
Both pages contained links to five or more fanedited movies .
TF : What exactly is their complaint ?
boon23 : Their problem is that people are sharing movies for free and they do not earn money from that , even if those movies are not the original versions .
They see a copyright infringement in this , despite our warnings and disclaimers for legality .
The MPAA demands are not clear yet .
TF : Not all studios have a huge problem with the site – tell us about Lucasfilm .
boon23 : Lucasfilm tolerated and accepted fan films .
A year ago we were contacted by their anti-piracy department regarding one fanedit they wanted to be removed , but they clearly stated that they had looked through the entire website and did not find anything offensive – and fanedit.org has about 80 !!!
Star Wars fanedits !
TF : You had a BitTorrent tracker on Fanedit.org , could you tell us more about that ?
boon23 : We used TorrentTrader but linked from it to external torrents only .
No torrent was ever transferred by our own tracker .
On the tracker we had about 400 torrent links to fanedits .
TF : Is this the first threatened legal action against the site ?
boon23 : Fanedit.org started in 2006 and we have not had any kind of legal problem before ( except for the small and rather positive incident with Lucasfilm ) .
The page was never private and open for all search engines .
TF : What steps are you taking in the face of these MPAA threats ?
boon23 : Dreamhost has informed us of the consequences – being shut down , lawsuit filing etc , so that is why we are taking down all the download links from Fanedit.org and the according forum now , which is an incredible amount of work .
We deactivated our tracker yesterday and cannot bring it up again on this webhost .
TF : Thanks for taking the time to speak with us , and good luck in the future .
Boon23 told us that he feels this MPAA action is a serious blow against an artform that is not harming the industry and was certainly never based on anything commercial , and he is saddened that this previously - tolerated ‘ gray area ’ ( such as with Lucasfilm ) has now come to an end .
Time will tell what the future is for Fanedit.org and fanedits in general .
In the meantime , it seems clear that a US - based host is causing difficulties for the site , which may have to relocate in order to survive .
Any offers of hosting will be gratefully received .

November 25 , 2008 -- I want to give some preliminary and personal impressions , in the heat of the moment , where many comrades are very preoccupied by the significance of the [ Chavista movement ’s ] loss of the Mayor of Greater Caracas and of some important or key governorships in the country .
It ’s time to calm down and sit down together in order to evaluate in depth with the comrades .
There are various points that we should analyse in order to draw conclusions that truly reflect reality .
It is necessary to open a profound debate within the party [ United Socialist Party of Venezuela – PSUV ] , to reflect and proceed with self - criticism , as President Chavez indicated on Sunday night .
First , I think it is necessary to stress the increase of votes for Chavismo across the entire country compared to last December 2 [ the constitutional reform referendum ] .
At the same time the opposition has demonstrated once again that there is a ceiling of votes that it cannot overcome , even if abstention levels are much lower .
Nevertheless , it managed to reach a level of support that allowed it to obtain political victories in important cities .
Second , I think it is necessary to stress that having gone into these elections divided in many states , as is the case of Carabobo , the candidates of Chavez carried out a very good election campaign although some of them did not win .
Third , I think that the warning that we gave from Marea Socialista [ Socialist Tide ] about some of the candidates , and above all the indication that they are leaders that express something that the revolutionary people profoundly reject , such as is the case of the endogenous right - wing , had a very important weight in fundamental districts such as the governorship of Miranda and others , for example Tachira .
The action of previous governments is what explains the defeat in Greater Caracas .
This is one of the most serious political problems that confronts the revolutionary process .
But there is a problem that is graver still .
That is the dynamic within the PSUV itself .
It is necessary to transform the party into a truly revolutionary party .
We cannot continue with the method of an electoral machine where the base only participates in an irregular manner , in limited primaries , that in general are controlled by the power of the endogenous right - wing .
The party demonstrates that it could be a great party , but it is necessary to stimulate the participation of the workers , of the popular sectors that are the fundamental base of the revolution .
And this stimulation should be political .
The fact is the party has taken little account of its trade union movement .
These electoral results , although they are positive , leave open the necessity of knowing that what is lacking is more democracy and more participation .
The militants must feel it is their party , not the party of the leaders , otherwise it will run the risk of converting itself into just one more party , just like the other ones .
Nevertheless , it is not enough to simply announce that there should be self - criticism .
The revolutionary people across the whole country must participate .
We , on our part , believe that the moment has arrived to clean out the government and the party .
A cleaning out and more revolution is what we need in order to ensure that working people govern in this revolution .

When bands of lumpen goons , armed with knives , guns , kerosene cans and shouts of " Jai Sri Ram " rule the streets , hunting those who belong to other faiths , they strut like warriors re-living a historical role .
Serial bombers , who maim and kill anyone and everyone within the range of the pellets packed in their crude bombs , celebrate death and destruction in the belief that Islamic history is on their side .
The anatomy of religious hate , which is becoming stronger by the day across the country , has a core - our past .
It is this that gives the hooligan a sense of purpose and a place in , what he believes to be , the larger scheme of things .
But where does the religious - minded goon learn the " history " that fills his mind with enough hate to commit irreligious acts of violence ?
Perhaps , the answer lies in our educational system , or lack of it .
The history textbooks , used by thousands of schools across the country , mix myth and legend with facts in a way that makes it difficult for students to distinguish between them .
Often enough , schoolteachers present myth as history and debunk history as myth .
The Sunday Times spoke to students at a Saraswati Shishu Mandir in west Delhi , run by the RSS , and found that they perceived Indian history to be nothing but a conflict between Hindus and Muslims .
A casual conversation with students at a Saraswati Bal Mandir in south Delhi unveiled an image of India as the oldest civilization in the world and the source of all knowledge and culture .
Meanwhile , the young children studying at a madrassa in Delhi's Okhla area do n't recognize names such as Ashoka , Buddha and Chandragupta .
These historical figures are alien to them .
It 's almost the same story in many of the more than 1,000 madrassas operating in the national capital .
But , the madrassas are changing .
It is getting harder to get into college and secure a job , so madrassas are increasingly opting for courses in English , computer science and the natural sciences .
But these Muslim religious schools still remain allergic to the social sciences , particularly history .
Years in a madrassa classroom may leave a student with barely any knowledge of some of the most important events in Indian and world history .
A former student of Varanasi's Jamia Salafia , a leading madrassa run by the socio-cultural organization , Ahl -i Hadith , says , " We are so cut off from the external world that students have no idea of the important trends and events in other parts of the world .
When you step out of the madrassa and go into the real world , you are lost . "
The young man , now enrolled in a history course in a Delhi college , adds , " I do n't have much of a problem with what they teach , but I have a problem with what they do n't teach , particularly history and political science . "
But the teaching of history is not enough to create a balanced picture of our multi-religious and multi-cultural country and our changing world .
At Saraswati Bal Mandir in Nehru Nagar in Delhi , children are taught history from NCERT books .
The school is affiliated to the CBSE , but its small campus is also filled with religious symbols and imagery - Bharat Mata in the principal 's office and Rama , the warrior , by the blackboard .
Most class XII students believe Rama was a historical figure .
" The scientific investigation of the old bridge between India and Sri Lanka has proved that it was built by Rama , " says a student , who is unaware of details of the Sethusamudram project case currently in the Supreme Court .
Many of the school 's students present the Ayodhya temple as proof that Rama existed .
Their history teacher offers the final bit of evidence : " The Ramacharitmanas proves that Rama was a historical figure .
What further proof do you want ? "
When asked to state when exactly Rama walked the earth , the teacher retorts : " It 's a matter of people 's faith and belief . "
Therein lies the problem .
Schools run by religious bodies - be they Hindu or Muslim - teach " matters of faith and belief " as historical fact .
It could end very badly , says Aditya Mukherjee , professor of history at Jawaharlal Nehru University .
" We will end up producing morons , " says the professor , who has written a book on the issue along with colleagues Mridula Mukherjee and Sucheta Mahajan .
Their book ,
The RSS , School Texts and the Murder of Mahatma Gandhi , analyzes history textbooks used by schools in the cow belt .
Mukherjee says , " They are putting poison into young minds by distorting the truth . "
The book lists some of the more bizarre ���facts ' taught as history , including bitter condemnation of Ashoka 's philosophy of ahimsa or non-violence , which is alleged to " make cowards of Indians " .
The textbooks also eulogise Hitler for his nationalism , cast Muslims as invaders and nothing else and claim that Iran and China 's first settlers were Indian kshatriyas .
These ' facts ' , which do not withstand independent scrutiny , are taught in an estimated 30,000 schools run by the Vidya Bharti , an apex all - India organization of the RSS .
More than 80,000 teachers convey these ' truths ' to three million children every year .
It is hardly better in thousands of madrassas across the country , where the syllabus remains virtually unchanged from the original prepared during the Mughal period and modified in the late 19th century .
" Students of these institutions are developing a world view that 's narrow and sectarian .
We have so much religion in the country that they do n't see anything odd with it , " says an official of the ministry of human resources development .
He adds that " political reasons " meant " we have failed to detoxify the curriculum of these schools .
It 's really dangerous .
We will pay a heavy price for ignoring primary education . "
Historians such as Aditya Mukherjee rue the fact that " nobody is bothered about the state of primary education in the country " .
With government schools either non-existent or not functioning , poor people in rural areas and urban pockets depend on these schools to educate their children .
Religious groups , pushing narrow agendas , have grabbed the space left vacant by the state .
Historical fact explains why .
In Nehru 's time , India was focused on creating and sustaining centres of higher education , such as the IITs , IIMs and central universities .
For all that Nehru believed that words such as dharma and mazheb were " dangerous " and should be kept out of the " temples of learning " , primary education was ignored during his tenure .
Now , it has become worse .
Today , with the Right to Education Bill ( 2005 ) , which guarantees free and compulsory education to every child in the 6 - 14 age group , stuck as the UPA government has failed to introduce a new draft in Parliament , primary education seems destined still to suffer at the hands of hate politics .
Hate and history are related .
Each time history repeats itself , the level of hate goes up .

We ’ve received several copies of this instructive flowchart , which the helpful illustrators of Graph jam have made available to coffee watchdogs the world over .
Seeing people print their passive - aggressive flowcharts off the Internet makes our resident nerd , Eric , sentimental for simpler times .
He quietly reflects on time spent wandering the halls of Brown University ’s CS department back in 2007 .
In those days , tech - minded individuals still made patronizing flowcharts the old - fashioned way , using OpenOffice on Linux .
Though such documents are most commonly spotted in offices populated by engineers and other technically inclined folk , even Kerry — who is not earning her Ph.d in Computer Science — can appreciate the clarity of a flowchart like this one :

It only took Google about three days to recognize , examine and fix the vulnerability that allowed Android phones to be ' jailbroken ' , and users should see the fix ( update RC30 ) pushed to their phones over the air during the next few days .
From the mouth of the Google :
We 've been notified of this issue ( Jailbreaking of Android ) and have developed a fix .
We 're currently working with our partners to push the fix out and updating the open source code base to reflect these changes .

So what do Android users stand to lose from this Apple - like vigilance ?
At present , very little .
The so - called ' jailbreak ' was of a completely different nature than the app - enabling hack that iPhone users are now so accustomed to .
The technique was a telnet trick that allowed for easy root access to the operating system , so the reality of the situation is less like a ' jailbreak ' in the iPhone sense , and more like finding the administrative password on a desktop Linux system .
The exploit did provide more access to the the Android 's core functions , some of which could be useful for app development and porting to other phones , but it also exposed a gaping vulnerability that would be immediately shut on any other Linux distribution .
Google 's patch is most accurately characterized as a security fix , not a party poop .

This is Terry Reed ’s way of protesting presidential candidate Barack Obama .
Mr. Reed who owns a construction and excavation company decided to park a trailer load of manure across the street from Whitehall ’s Democratic campaign office on Saturday .
He also posted a sign in the manure mocking Obama ’s “ change we can believe in ” slogan as “ a load of crap . ”
“ I think Obama ’s plan is just one big old poop sandwich and we ’re all going to have to take a bite , ” he said .
Suzanne Molyneaux , the Obama campaign ’s election team leader in Whitehall , said traffic came to a near standstill as people stopped to take pictures of the trailer .
Mr. Reed will not move the trailer until after the election is over .
Suzanne is very upset by this and rightly so .
“ People in Whitehall were upset , they were outraged , ” she said .
“ I do n’t think Whitehall should be represented as this podunk , ignorant community .
There are lots of good people here . ”
Back in 1984 , the conservative industrialist J. Peter Grace was telling whoever would listen why government was such a wasteful institution .
One reason , which he spelled out in a book chapter on privatization , was that " government - run enterprises lack the driving forces of marketplace competition , which promote tight , efficient operations .
This bears repetition , " he wrote , " because it is such a profound and important truth . "
And ...
Mr Strimple said : " We have just started advertising there heavily and I believe that every one of those states will snap back heavily in our favour . "
But behind the scenes a mood of grim pessimism has gripped McCain staff .
Even in the aftermath of Sarah Palin 's triumphant speech at the Republican convention , one of Mr McCain 's closest aides told The Sunday Telegraph that he expected Mrs Palin and her state of Alaska to disappear from public view within six weeks , a tacit admission that he expects to lose the election .
Topless at 52 : Kim Cattrall bares all in the name of art ... and holds her own among the younger models
Kim Cattrall is nothing if not brave .
The game actress 's latest role called for her to take off her clothes for a worthy cause - to save a valuable artwork - alongside a troupe of super - fit twenty - something performers from theatre production La Clique .
And the 52 - year - old actress , who regularly stripped in television show Sex And The City , duly rose to the challenge , holding her own among the nubile young bodies who were assembled to recreate Titian masterpiece Diana and Actaeon .
BBC Two 's The Culture Show teamed up with artist and photographer Tom Hunter to create a modern - day version of the artwork .
In the name of art : Kim Cattrall , 52 , bared virtually all to recreate Titian masterpiece Diana and Actaeon alongside ( L - R ) Gemma Rolls - Bentley , Kimberly Williams and Yulia Pykhtina
The shoot was organised by BBC programme The Culture Show and helmed by photographer and artist Tom Hunter
Tom Hunter is well known for his recreation of old masters and is the only photographer to have had an exhibition at the National Gallery , London .
The Culture Show challenged Hunter to create a 21st century version of the painting after he came out in support of the campaign to raise £ 50 million to keep it on public display in Britain .
For the recreation , Cattrall posed alongside the cast of cult cabaret production La Clique ; David O Mer , Fiona Anderson , Anna Harnden , Alexandra Roy , Ursula Martinez , Gemma Rolls - Bentley , Kimberly Williams and Yulia Pykhtina .
Titian 's Diana :
One of two paintings - Diana and Actaeon , and Diana and Callisto - being offered by the Duke of Sutherland to the National Galleries of Scotland and the National Gallery of London at £ 50 million
And Miss Cattrall features as Diana in the picture alongside art students from the Courtauld Institute and performers from the hit West End burlesque show La Clique .
Tom said : ' Kim is the perfect Diana .
Just like the Greek goddess , she combines beauty with a sense of threat .
' She was a great sport and at 52 made an amazing Diana .
She more than held her own among a room full of twenty - somethings .
' The picture can't of course hold a candle to the original which deserves to remain on public view .
This painting is sublime and to lose it to a private collection would be a tragedy . '
Cattrall , whose parents are British , is a regular visitor to the National Gallery and a huge admirer of Titian 's work .

She said : ' Viewing this painting is like being in the presence of genius , it would be a tragedy if it were not on public view ' .
The Duke of Sutherland , who owns the painting , has given the National Galleries of Scotland and the National Gallery , London until December 31 to raise £ 50 million to buy it from him .
After that point , he may sell it on the open market .
Earlier this month , artist Tracey Emin took a petition to Downing Street to try to garner support for the campaign and the signatories include artists Damien Hirst , Anthony Gormley and Lucian Freud .
The Culture Show featuring the collaboration will be screened on BBC2 on 25th November at 10 pm .
On Dec. 11 , 2004 , John and James ( as they 're called in court papers ) escaped hell .
Their parents had all but abandoned them .
The boys — one 4 years old , the other 4 months old — suffered from scalp ringworm .
The baby had an ear infection .
Medicine sat in their house , unopened and expired .
When Florida Department of Children and Families agents removed the kids , John was wearing a dirty , adult - size T - shirt and sneakers four sizes too small .
DCF officials learned that the older boy had been his half - brother 's caretaker for weeks , if not longer .
DCF turned to Frank Martin Gill , a 43 - year - old flight attendant with a master 's degree in public health and a bachelor 's degree in psychology .
Gill had fostered seven children before , and he agreed to take the boys in , even though he and his domestic partner — identified in court records as Tom Roe Sr. — planned to move to Georgia .
The couple , who had been together five years , thought the arrangement was temporary .
Over the next few weeks , Gill learned how far behind John , the older boy , had fallen .
He 'd never seen a book .
He could n't identify colors , count or even hold a pencil .
He hoarded food at dinnertime , as if he were afraid he'd never be fed again .
For a month , he did n't even speak .
But as time passed , both boys acclimated to their new family .
Gill and Roe became " papi " and " daddy . "
They were , as one caseworker later put it , " model foster parents . "
By July 2006 , courts had terminated the parental rights of the boys ' parents .
John and James were officially wards of the state .
They became two of the 1,000 kids that DCF has at any given time awaiting adoption .
In other states , Gill would be a natural adoptive parent .
But he 's gay , and in Florida , adoption by gay parents is illegal .
Gill sued .
On Nov. 25 , Miami -Dade Circuit Judge Cindy Lederman struck down the law in a sharply worded 53 - page ruling .
She called it " illogical to the point of irrationality . "
The state attorney general 's office , helmed by former Orlando congressman Bill McCollum , immediately promised to appeal .
That much made the media rounds .
But most reporters missed the real story of how Florida made its case .
At the four - day October trial , the state called only two witnesses .
Both testified that gays are n't fit parents because they 're mentally unstable .
They were paid $ 87,000 collectively for their trouble .
click to enlarge
The state 's star witness , clinical psychologist Dr. George Rekers , is a Southern Baptist minister who founded the right - wing Family Research Council and has nearly 30 years of virulently anti-gay writings to his credit .
The other witness , Dr. Walter Schumm , is a Kansas State University family studies professor who uses " statistics to highlight the truth of the Scripture . "
Rekers and Schumm stake out religiously rooted anti-gay positions that run counter to the research of organizations like the American Psychological Association , the American Academy of Pediatrics and others , who say there 's no problem with gay parents .
" These people are religious radicals , " says Robert Rosenwald , one of the ACLU attorneys who represented Gill .
The state 's case had nothing to do with John and James ' well - being .
Florida never challenged Gill 's abilities as a parent or rebutted the idea that removing the boys from his care would be emotionally devastating to them .
Instead , it defended the law 's discriminatory nature and bigoted underpinnings ( see sidebar , page 18 ) .
And to do that , they hired two men who are n't afraid to conflate science and religion .
Star witness
Rekers is the ideal expert for a state that has long codified its moral objection to gays adopting kids .
In court , he testified that even if scientific data conclusively proved that children of gay parents do just as well as children of straight parents , he 'd still want gay adoption banned .
He 's written such books as The Christian in an Age of Sexual Eclipse ( 1981 ) , Growing Up Straight : What Families Should Know About Homosexuality ( 1982 ) and Shaping Your Child 's Sexual Identity ( 1982 ) .
In the latter , Rekers writes that " gay liberationists " are plotting to " legalize pedophilia . "
In Growing Up Straight , he writes : " Homosexual activists seek to lure our children into a deceptive and `destructive` fantasy world that ignores the obvious physical , social and moral boundaries of sexual oppression . "
Also :
" When scholars disregard divine law , they deliberately suppress truth and result in foolish and futile speculations . "
In court , he testified that the state should n't allow gays to adopt because , as a demographic group , they have higher rates of depression , suicide , drug use , relationship instability and psychiatric problems than the population as a whole .
Thus , he says gay parents put the children they raise at risk for any number of developmental maladies .
In his view , those factors make gays ill - equipped to be good parents .
He dismisses numerous studies suggesting that children of gay parents are no worse off than those of straight parents , saying the methodology of such studies is flawed and the researchers who perform them are politically motivated .
" Of course , " he tells Orlando Weekly , " most of the people conducting those studies carefully select `gay` parents who are not depressed . "
Rekers holds a doctorate in behavioral psychology from the University of California at Los Angeles , did a postdoctoral study at Harvard University and spent his career at the universities of Florida , Kansas State and South Carolina 's medical school .
He also has a master 's degree in divinity from Columbia International University and a doctorate in theology from the University of South Africa .
He serves on the board of directors for the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality , which advocates " reparative therapy " to turn gays straight , a controversial practice strongly discouraged by the American Psychological Association .
He 's an ordained Southern Baptist minister and a founder of the Family Research Council , an organization " dedicated to the promotion of marriage and family and the sanctity of human life in national policy , " according to its website .
He says his testimony was based on science , not his religious beliefs .
At trial , the ACLU disputed that notion , a tactic Rekers takes personally .
" If they 're not winning on the data , they try to do character assassination , " he says .
The ACLU lawyers asked if he thought homosexuality is a sin .
" Well , I believe that is what the Bible teaches , " he replied .
They asked about his early anti-gay writings .
" I do n't endorse things I have written 26 years ago , " he said .
" I do n't endorse or necessarily believe anything written in these books . "
He disavows his earlier work because he did n't undergo theological training until the 1990s .
His views on homosexuality have n't changed , he says , but he 's less strident .
" My views are similar to roughly one - half of the U.S. population .
The ACLU wants to paint it as some extremist point of view .
I did not bring my religion into the courtroom . "
Like terrorists
Rekers spells out his gay - adoption views at length in a 99 - page St. Thomas Law Review article written in 2005 titled " An Empirically Supported Rational Basis for Prohibiting Adoption , Foster Parenting and Contested Child Custody by Any Person in a Household that Includes a Homosexually - Behaving Member . "
In it Rekers argues , " There is a strong rational basis for laws or regulations prohibiting adoption or foster parenting of a child by any person engaged in sexual behavior with another individual of the same sex and to any person living in a household in which there resides an adult or adolescent household member who engages in sexual behavior with another individual of the same sex . "
In court , Rekers said that he favored removing children from any gay home in favor of a straight home , even if the child had been there 10 years .
Placing children in households with homosexuals is like placing them with the blind , or perhaps Al - Qaida , he explains in the article .
" This is not basically different from denying placement in other households with structures that are not in the best interests of children .
Fifteen - year - old couples , 90 - year - old couples , Thai - language - only speaking couples , blind and deaf parents , households with a pedophilic - behaving adult , households with practicing criminals , households with drug dealers and drug abusers , households with unemployed adults , households that advocate the overthrow of the U.S. government , households with an active terrorist , households with sexually promiscuous unmarried men and women co-habitating and households with homosexually behaving adults all have either inherent instability or inherent disadvantage , stress , and potential harm to placed children . "
He cautions not to read too much into this .
" Even the terrorists , 95 percent might be good parents to their own child , " he says in an interview .
" But you do n't want to risk it . "
Schumm , the state 's other witness , has a collegial relationship with Rekers .
The two co-authored a book chapter titled " Sex Should Occur Only Within Marriage " that said , " We prefer to accept the authority of the Bible as the best guide for sexual decision - making , as well as for many other areas of life . "
The authors wrote that they " disagree with homosexual practices . "
In a Journal of Psychology and Theology article , Schumm explained that " with respect to the integration of faith and research , I have been trying to use statistics to highlight the truth of the Scripture . "
Schumm specializes in family studies and statistics .
In his testimony , he analyzed research that claimed there was little difference between gay and straight parenting .
He believes that other academics overlook research that casts aspersions on gay parenting and indicates that children of gay parents tend to have higher levels of same - sex attraction than children of straight parents .
He recalculated data to show differences in gay and straight parenting that original researchers had chalked up to statistical sample error .
Nonetheless , during cross-examination , Schumm conceded that at least for some children , being adopted by gay parents could be beneficial .
In an e-mail interview , Schumm chafes at the idea that he 's a " religious radical . "
Instead , he says , he 's merely pointing out the unwillingness of other researchers to challenge politically correct positions .
" Consider if science is dogmatic by its nature or not , " he writes .
" Consider the dogmatic statements I found `in previous research` .
Yet the person accused of being dogmatic and a religious fanatic and a liar was myself .
All I did was point out how dogmatic the other side has been . "
To Schumm , it 's inconceivable that gay parenting is exactly the same as straight parenting .
" It 's just not logical to say that no aspect of the environment whatsoever can have ever had any impact whatsoever on a given variable , " he writes .
He also sees social engineering at play .
" The larger picture , as I see it , is an attempt to make same - sex relationships socially and morally equivalent to mixed - gender sexual relationships .
I do n't like that idea because I think it promotes inequality .
There are risks and costs associated with mixed - gender relationships that are unique to mixed - gender relationships , but there are unique benefits for society ( mainly children that have two biological parents raising them ) from them .
If we treat all things the same , we are unfairly discriminating against those people who are taking more risks and providing society with more benefits . "
' The child is absent '
To Judge Lederman 's dismay , the state did n't call any witnesses to talk about the children 's rights during the trial .
" The child is absent from this argument , " she wrote .
By contrast , lawyers for Gill , the adoptive father , had plenty to say .
Dr. David Brodzinsky , a California developmental psychologist who specializes in adoption and foster - care cases , assessed James and John in their foster home and told the court that removing them would be emotionally devastating .
The state never challenged that assertion .
Ronald Gilbert , the guardian ad litem appointed to look out for the children 's rights , also testified that removing them would be " against their manifest best interests .
I think it would be tragic .
These kids were subject to abuse and neglect , and this would add legal abuse and neglect to their placement , and their mental and physical well - being . "
The state did n't cross-examine Gilbert .
Yves Francois , the adoption supervisor for the Center for Family and Child Enrichment — a DCF subcontractor that acts as an adoption agency — testified that Gill and Roe met all the criteria for adoption but one , their sexual orientation .
If their adoption request was denied , he said , the CFCE would keep looking , and in all likelihood , the siblings would end up being separated .
To date , no one else has applied to adopt James and John .
Other psychologists hammered Rekers and Schumm .
Dr. Letitia Peplau , a UCLA psychologist and relationship expert , testified that the breakup rates of unmarried , cohabitating heterosexual and gay couples are very similar .
Dr. Susan Cochran , a UCLA epidemiologist and psychology expert , explained that while the overwhelming research shows that gays have slightly higher rates of psychiatric problems , substance abuse and smoking than straights , those rates are also higher for American Indians , yet no one tries to exclude them from adopting .
Dr. Michael Lamb , a psychologist at the University of Cambridge in London , told the court that placing children in a " traditional " household environment is n't as important as once thought .
Instead , the quality of parenting is much more vital to childhood development .
In her ruling , Lederman dismissed testimony from Rekers and Schumm .
Schumm , she wrote , " admitted that he applies statistical standards that depart from conventions in his field . "
Schumm believes the judge unfairly discredited him .
" She cherry picked , it would seem , obscure lines from obscure papers , totally out of context , to try to discredit my science , " he writes .
Lederman had more scathing words for Rekers .
His testimony " was far from a neutral and unbiased recitation of the relevant scientific evidence , " she wrote .
" Dr. Rekers ' beliefs are motivated by his strong ideological and theological convictions . …
The court cannot consider his testimony to be credible nor worthy of forming the basis of public policy . "
Serious scientists
" From the outset , the state was in a weird position , " says Rosenwald , the ACLU attorney .
" It only got more complicated when they tried to find experts .
They were looking for serious scientists .
They were told no serious scientists would testify on their behalf . "
Indeed , Rekers and Schumm stand diametrically opposed to the position of the American Psychological Association , which in 2004 put out a statement in support of gay parenting .
It 's unclear who developed the state 's strategy .
A spokeswoman for the attorney general 's office said its lawyers took their cues from DCF .
DCF 's spokeswoman offered another perspective : " I 'm going to have to say it came from the attorney general 's office in terms of legal strategy , " says Sarrah Troncoso .
" I would have to defer to them . "
From a political perspective , that explanation makes sense .
DCF 's leader is George Sheldon , a lifelong Democrat who has enjoyed a good relationship with the gay community since the 1980s , when he served in the Florida Legislature .
Republican Attorney General Bill McCollum , on the other hand , is a conservative eyeing a U.S. Senate seat in 2010 .
Troncoso says DCF takes no joy in pursuing this case in appellate court .
" We have to follow what the Legislature puts in place , " she says .
" We 're an executive branch `office` ; we have to enforce what the Legislature says . "
Year after year , progressive lawmakers have tried to repeal the gay - adoption ban without success .
In 2006 , Republican state Rep. Bill Galvano said he was willing to discuss the gay adoption ban ; the Christian Family Coalition blasted him with e-mails warning of " homosexual extremists . "
Needless to say , that push never got traction .
State Sen. Nan Rich , D - Weston , will file another bill to get rid of the ban next year .
She 's not optimistic .
" The chances of this bill even being heard are remote , " she says .
Lederman 's decision to strike down the state law as unconstitutional is rooted in the idea that the children 's rights to a good home supersede a gay - adoption ban that does n't have a rational basis .
She 's not the first judge to rule that way .
In August , a judge in Monroe County allowed a gay parent to adopt .
( The state did n't fight that case because the children involved were n't in foster care , so they were n't under DCF 's supervision . )
At least three times since the 1990s , state judges have found the law unconstitutional , but they 've all been overruled .
As recently as 2004 , in a case called Lofton v. Secretary of the Department of Children and Family Services , a U.S. appeals court upheld the state gay - adoption ban , stating , " Openly homosexual households represent a very recent phenomenon , and sufficient time has not yet passed to permit any scientific study of how children raised in those households fare as adults . "
This time around , says the ACLU 's Rosenwald , the science will prove conclusive in his favor .
Stereotypes
All prospective adoptive parents go through a screening process that involves background checks , evaluation and training .
The process — which can take eight months — is supposed to catch problems before children are placed in a home .
Rekers says there are only two ways to determine if adoptive parents have psychiatric problems : a clinical evaluation or determining if they belong to a high - risk group .
Since evaluations measure a person 's current status , he prefers the second method : " The only way you can predict long - term `behavior` is what kind of group they 're in . "
Which is why Rekers sees the ban as beneficial .
But the argument has two flaws .
The first problem involves using population samples to draw conclusions about the gay community at large , when in fact gay parents are self - selecting — they choose to be parents .
The argument goes that gay parents who elect to become parents , subjecting themselves to background checks , might not have the negative attributes of the population as a whole .
Rekers says research comparing gay parents to the population as a whole in terms of mental illness or drug use has n't been done .
" That specific variable has n't been explored , " he notes .
Problem No. 2 : Rekers ' argument is based on stereotyping gays as drug - addled , mentally unstable and reckless .
But gays are n't monolithic .
Even if gays as a demographic group have higher propensities toward psychiatric problems , not all of them do .
But by law , the state of Florida assumes just that .
It declines to look at individual parents , and instead relies on stereotypes of gays as troubled individuals .
Here 's a final question :
If Gill and Roe are inadequate parents , why are James and John still with them after four years ?
On the other hand , if , as court records say , the children have excelled under their care , what logical reason is there to keep them from adopting ?
' Stick and sad values '
In 1977 the Metro - Dade Commission in Miami , cheered on by gay - rights activists , passed a landmark law banning housing , employment , credit and public accommodations discrimination against gays .
It set off a firestorm , a full - throttle assault on the community led by a beauty - queen - turned - holy - warrior named Anita Bryant .
Spurred by her belief that homosexuality is a sin that should n't be even remotely condoned by government , the Miss America runner - up , citrus industry spokeswoman and devout Southern Baptist singer Anita Bryant launched the " Save our Children " campaign .
Things got ugly fast .
Bryant claimed that the ordinance would force school principals to hire gay teachers , who could , in the words of a contemporary Time magazine piece , " lead their pupils astray . "
She described the gays ' " evil influence " : " As a mother , I know the homosexuals cannot biologically reproduce children .
Therefore , they must recruit our children . "
Her goal was to " seek help and change for homosexuals , whose sick and sad values belie the word ‘ gay ' which they pathetically use to cover their unhappy lives . "
Her group bought full - page newspaper advertisements warning of a plague of child pornography .
She went into the Cuban community and threatened calamity of Biblical proportions : " It would break my heart if Miami would become another Sodom and Gomorrah and you would have to leave again . "
The fear - mongering worked .
In June 1977 , by a 2 - to - 1 margin , Dade County voters revoked the law .
According to Time , Bryant and husband Bob Green celebrated their victory by kissing in front of reporters .
" This is what heterosexuals do , fellows , " Green said .
( The couple divorced in 1980 . )
Miami reinstated the gay - rights ordinance in 1998 .
Bryant reaped a backlash .
She lost thousands of dollars ' worth of contracts , including her lucrative deal with the Florida citrus industry , after activists announced a boycott of Florida citrus products .
She was parodied in National Lampoon and eventually filed for bankruptcy .
Over the last three decades , public opinion has evolved .
Even among many social conservatives , gays are no longer considered the predatory perverts Bryant made them out to be .
Yet one relic from Bryant 's crusade remains :
In the midst of the anti-gay furor of 1977 , the Florida Legislature passed what became Florida Statute 63.042(3 ) .
It simply reads : " No person eligible to adopt under this statute may adopt if that person is a homosexual . "
The day the Florida Senate passed that law , a freshman senator from Clearwater — one of only five who voted against it — asked his colleagues , " Will we sleep better knowing we have institutionalized shame for those who have already felt shame ? "

Negligent Driving
Over the past 30 years deaths caused by drunk drivers have plummeted , but overall traffic fatalities have increased .
Why ?
For the first time in 30 years , all of the major indicators of traffic safety - overall fatalities as well as the fatality rates - increased .
There are a lot of reasons for this , many of which have to do with drivers becoming more distracted , impatient , careless , and ultimately , negligent .
The intersection of high - tech , in - car gadgets and busy , sleep - deprived people who speed off to work while multitasking has created a perfect storm of highway risks that is reflected in ever - higher traffic fatalities .
To effectively turn the tide on highway deaths , the nation must view traffic safety within the context of negligent driving .
Negligent drivers - whether they are speeding , drunk , distracted , or overly fatigued - put themselves and others at risk , often vastly underestimating the danger posed by their behavior .
There is often a disconnect between the public 's perception of the danger of various actions , and the actual danger correlated with them , resulting in millions of unknowingly negligent drivers cruising the roads at any given moment .
This website brings together research and government data to illustrate today 's traffic safety situation and to educate the public regarding the hazards posed by negligent driving , and to offer solutions to help make the highways safer .
Legal minds respond to landmark 9/11 civil suit against Rumsfeld , Cheney Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday December 18 , 2008
Print This Email This April Gallop ' will be very disappointed , ' lawyer tells RAW STORY .
April Gallop , whom the Army News Service called a " hero " after she was awarded the Purple Heart for injuries sustained at the Pentagon on Sept. 11 , 2001 , will not likely be triggering another such response from internal government media .
On behalf of Spc. April Gallop , who served in the Network Infrastructure Services Agency as an administrative specialist , California attorney William Veale on Monday filed a civil suit against former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , Vice President Dick Cheney and former US Air Force General Richard Myers , who was acting chairman of the joint chiefs on 9/11 .
The suit alleges they engaged in conspiracy to facilitate the terrorist attacks and purposefully failed to warn those inside the Pentagon , contributing to injuries she and her two - month - old son incurred .
Additional , unnamed persons with foreknowledge of the attacks are also named .
First news of the suit was carried exclusively by RAW STORY .
Full text of the claims may be read here .
" Everything happened so fast , " Gallop said in an Oct. 2001 published report .
" I remember thinking that we had been bombed . "
After rescuing one of her coworkers , the two began searching the smoldering debris that used to be April 's office for her two - month - old son Elisha .
She pulled him out and escaped the smoke - filled building , out onto the Pentagon 's lawn , and collapsed .
Though thankful she survived the event , " I 'm still angry at the enemy , " she said .
" They will pay . "
Years later , she 's pursuing that payment in the form of a civil suit .
" I remember being so disgusted at the frequency of random drill exercises taking place for us to evacuate the building , " Gallop told George Washington blog in a 2006 interview .
" It seemed as if they always happened when I had to take care of certain things .
" Yet on September 11th , the day when our lives were threatened , not one alarm . "
April sustained a mild brain injury , but still struggles with Post Concussive Syndrome and hearing loss .
Her son also suffered a mild brain injury which has since spiraled out into a learning disability .
On the attack , Gallop 's recall is somewhat different from the official story .
She continued , " I have been misquoted on numerous occasions .
That happens when individuals have ulterior motives .
But here is my statement for the record .
" I was located at the E ring .
From my inside perspective , with no knowledge of what had actually happened on the outside , it did sound like a bomb .
And we had to escape the building before the floors , debris etc. collapsed on us .
" And I do n't recall at anytime seeing any plane debris .
Again , I do n't know what plane debris would look like after hitting a building .
But I would have recalled unusual looking pieces similar to plane parts . "
" What they do n't want is for this to go into discovery , " said Gallop 's attorney , Mr. Veale , speaking to RAW STORY .
" If we can make it past their initial motion to dismiss these claims , and we get the power of subpoena , then we 've got a real shot at getting to the bottom of this .
We 've got the law on our side . "
Does it have a chance ?
RAW STORY solicited the opinions of a number of lawyers with prior experience suing the federal government in civil court .
" The 15 page Complaint appears to be the product of a lot of hard research , alleging in meticulous detail an ongoing conspiracy among the named defendants to either cause or allow the attacks to happen and to catch us totally unprepared , " said Gerald A. Sterns , Esq. , of San Francisco law firm Sterns & Walker .
" We have seen conspiracy allegations before and an undercurrent of doubt remains as to just what did happen that day and why ?
Without question it was the turning point in the up to that time , far from a notable term as president for George Bush , following his controversial ascent to the office less than a year before . "
According to the Sterns & Walker Web site , the firm represents survivors of aircraft and other major accidents and catastrophes .
The firm " has been involved in almost every major air carrier accident case , and hundreds of other cases involving claims against major defendants , " including the United States of America .
" We have already had a precursor of this , which unfortunately for the plaintiff , spells out what will happen to her case .
Ex -CIA agent , Valerie Plame , whose cover was deliberately blown by Cheney and probably others at the White House , in retaliation for the unkind remarks her husband made after his investigation concerning the Bush claim that Saddam Hussein had attempted to purchase raw material for a weapon of mass destruction from a country in Africa , filed a damage suit against Cheney and others for destroying her career , " said Sterns .
He added : " However we may feel about these individuals , and what impact they had on the United States , we fear [ Ms. Gallop ] will be very disappointed in trying to address issues or obtain answers through the judicial process . "
Sterns ' prediction of failure is tempered by attorney Phillip L. Marcus out of Columbia , Maryland , who specializes in intellectual property and copyright law .
Marcus professed to RAW STORY an expertise in Bivens vs. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents , a case in which the Supreme Court determined that the government could be sued for the violation of a Constitutional right , even if no federal statute exists to support such action .
" Jurisdiction is the big hurdle for the plaintiff , but there are two routes over the hurdle , the Bivens Doctrine ( that where the facts support serious rights violations by federal agents there is a kind of federal common law jurisdiction , else violations of the Bill of Rights could not be remedied ) , and 28 USC sec .
1331 , which is the Tort Claims Act , " said Marcus .
" Mr. Veale has made extraordinary allegations .
Normally if you simply allege enough facts for jurisdiction the court goes past that defense .
" But with such bizarre facts the judge is going to want to see a little bit of evidence to believe it has Bivens jurisdiction or FTCA jurisdiction , before letting Veale go ahead with what will be massive discovery -- tons of documents , and depositions under oath of Cheney , Rummy and many others , defendants and plain witnesses . "
He concludes : " I 'd bet [ this story ] lives at least four or five years , lots of news stories . "
The complete text of both attorneys ' opinions on the April Gallop suit is below .

When is the United States or any of its officers , agents or employees able to be held liable in a court of law ?
Can the civil judicial system , seeking damages , as opposed to a criminal charge , be used to correct what might be perceived as just not misconduct , but alleged criminal activity on the part of those in our government ?
The answers to these questions can be complicated , but it seems clear that one case , discussed below , will not have much chance of success .
The frustrations of many many Americans may well be evident in the suit filed in the federal court for the Eastern District of New York by [ April Gallop ] , who seeks damages against the sitting vice president , Dick Cheney , the ex secretary of defense , Donald Rumsfeld , and others , all arising out of the events of September 11 , 2001 .
The 15 page Complaint appears to be the product of a lot of hard research , alleging in meticulous detail an ongoing conspiracy among the named defendants to either cause or allow the attacks to happen and to catch us totally unprepared .
We have seen conspiracy allegations before and an undercurrent of doubt remains as to just what did happen that day and why ?
Without question it was the turning point in the up to that time , far from a notable term as president for George Bush , following his controversial ascent to the office less than a year before .
However , although it may be easy to sympathize with some of the criticisms and allegations made against Cheney , Rumsfeld and the others ( interesting enough , Bush is not named in the suit ) , as we look back over the last eight years , and however we may feel about these individuals , and what impact they had on the United States , we fear [ Ms. Gallop ] will be very disappointed in trying to address issues or obtain answers through the judicial process .
We have already had a precursor of this , which unfortunately for the plaintiff , spells out what will happen to her case .
Ex -CIA agent , Valerie Plame .
whose cover was deliberately blown by Cheney and probably others at the White House , in retaliation for the unkind remarks her husband made after his investigation concerning the Bush claim that Sadaam Hussein had attempted to purchase raw material for a weapon of mass destruction from a country in Africa , filed a damage suit against Cheney and others for destroying her career .
The court summarily ruled that the case did not lie ; political questions such as this are routinely not heard by the courts .
The court also ruled there was an across the board immunity for anything the sitting vice president did or did not do while in office .
The same would be true , of course , as to any suit one might try to file against Bush , including after he leaves office .
It seems clear here the same rules apply and the same result will obtain .
The court will dismiss this case on motion of the defendants , for the same reasons .
However one may view Mr. Cheney , described by many as the Prince of Darkness , and worse ; his actions while vice president of the United States are protected from judicial review .
The sole remedy found in the Constitution to deal with unworthy office holders is impeachment .
This is not to say that suits may not be brought against the government itself .
Indeed they can be , and are filed every day on a variety of issues .
Our law firm has handled many of these , and with success .
The courts have held that the United States starts with an overall immunity , but may waive that and permit suits against it , as Congress dictates .
One common example is the Federal Tort Claims Act , from 1946 , which authorizes suit against the United States for damages caused by an act or omission of the government , acting through agents or agencies , if such conduct would have been actionable under the law of the state where the act or omission occurred .
There are some exceptions and some special defense available to the government , principally the Discretionary Function defense , which also shield government employees , right up to and including the president for decisions and actions , turning out in retrospect to be right or wrong , based upon an exercise of that discretion .
That defense has so far shielded the United States from any liability arising out of the Kenya and Tanzania embassy bombings some ten years ago , but the fight goes on .

This has a little bit of the feel of the Hatfill case , the guy who was " of interest " in anthrax envelopes , and then was n't .

All of us have experienced being in a new place and feeling certain that we have been there before .
This mysterious feeling , commonly known as déjà vu , occurs when we feel that a new situation is familiar , even if there is evidence that the situation could not have occurred previously .
For a long time , this eerie sensation has been attributed to everything from paranormal disturbances to neurological disorders .
However , in recent years , as more scientists began studying this phenomenon , a number of theories about déjà vu have emerged , suggesting that it is not merely a glitch in our brain ’s memory system .
A new report by Colorado State University psychologist Anne M. Cleary , published in Current Directions in Psychological Science , a journal of the Association for Psychological Science , describes recent findings about déjà vu , including the many similarities that exist between déjà vu and our understanding of human recognition memory .
Recognition memory is the type of memory that allows us to realize that what we are currently experiencing has already been experienced before , such as when we recognize a friend on the street or hear a familiar song on the radio .
The brain fluctuates between two different types of recognition memory : recollection and familiarity .
Recollection - based recognition occurs when we can pinpoint an instance when a current situation has previously occurred .
For example , seeing a familiar man at a store and realizing that we ’ve seen him before on the bus .
On the other hand , familiarity - based recognition occurs when our current situation feels familiar , but we do n’t remember when it has happened before .
For example , we see that familiar man in the store , but we just ca n’t remember where we know him from .
Déjà vu is believed to be an example of familiarity - based recognition — during déjà vu , we are convinced that we recognize the situation , but we are not sure why .
Cleary conducted experiments testing familiarity - based recognition in which participants were given a list of celebrity names .
Later on , they were shown a collection of celebrity photographs ; some photographs corresponded to the names on the list , other photographs did not .
The volunteers were told to identify the celebrities in the photographs and indicate how likely it was the celebrity ’s names were on the list they had seen previously .
The findings were surprising .
Even when the volunteers were unable to identify a celebrity by photo , they had a sense of which names they had studied earlier and which they had not .
That is , they could n’t identify the source of their familiarity with the celebrity , but they knew the celebrity was familiar to them .
Cleary repeated the experiment substituting famous places ( such as Stonehenge and the Taj Majal ) for celebrities and got similar results .
These findings indicate that the participants stored a little bit of the memory , but it was hazy , so they were not able to connect it to the new experience .
Cleary also ran experiments to figure out what features or elements of situations could trigger feelings of familiarity .
She had participants study a random list of words .
During a word recognition test , some of the words on the test resembled the earlier words , although only in sound ( e.g. lady sounds similar to eighty ) , but the volunteers reported a sense of familiarity for the new words , even when they could not recall the earlier - presented , similar - sounding words that were the source of this familiarity .
Previous research has also shown that people feel familiarity when shown a visual fragment containing isolated geometric shapes from an earlier experience .
This suggests that familiar geometric shapes may create the sense that an entire new scene has been viewed before .
These results support the idea that events and episodes which we experience are stored in our memory as individual elements or fragments of that event .
Déjà vu may occur when specific aspects of a current situation resemble certain aspects of previously occurring situations ; if there is a lot of overlap between the elements of the new and old situations , we get a strong feeling of familiarity .
“ Many parallels between explanations of déjà vu and theories of human recognition memory exist ” , Cleary concludes , “ Theories of familiarity - based recognition and the laboratory methods used to study it may be especially useful for elucidating the processes underlying déjà vu experiences . ”

Liberals have n’t had so much fun in decades .
Aside from the dwindling size of our 401 ( k ) s , life is treating us well .
True , we ’re heading into a major recession .
But that ’s OK :
That just presents us with new opportunities to Do Good .
And while we wait for President Obama to bring us New Deal 2.0 , we ’ll also get a few giggles out of watching the Bush administration preside over the nationalization of the nation ’s financial sector .
( Tip : Practice saying “ social democracy . ”
Also , practice saying “ Told ya so ! ” with compassion . )
Maybe most fun of all , we ’re getting to watch a steady procession of rats leaving the sinking GOP ship .
One by one , the nation ’s more reputable conservatives have been edging away from the Republican presidential ticket .
It started with John McCain ’s choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate .
Thinking conservatives -- as of a couple of months ago , there were still a few left -- were distinctly underwhelmed .
In the New York Times , David Brooks chastised McCain for “ throw[ing ] away standards of experience and prudence ” by picking Palin .
In the Washington Post , Charles Krauthammer said Palin was “ not ready ” for prime time .
David Frum , a former Bush speechwriter and fellow at the American Enterprise Institute , complained that Palin had “ thoroughly -- and probably irretrievably -- proven that she is not up to the job . ”
In the National Review , conservative columnist Kathleen Parker said Palin was “ clearly out of her league ” and urged her to “ bow out . ”

For liberals initially alarmed by McCain ’s brief post - convention poll bounce , this was fun .
And as conservative disdain spread to the whole GOP ticket , the fun got even funner .
In the Washington Post , George Will slammed McCain for his “ fact - free slander , ” “ substitution of vehemence for coherence ” and “ boiling moralism . ”
On MSNBC , former Reagan speechwriter and Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan admitted that she ’s not sure who she ’ll be voting for this November : “ Ahh. Umm .
I ’m thinking it through . ”
Then -- more fun -- some conservatives began to actually endorse Barack Obama .
Wick Allison , a former publisher of the National Review , wrote that today ’s brand of conservatism “ has produced financial mismanagement , the waste of human lives , the loss of moral authority , and the wreckage of our economy that McCain now threatens to make worse .
... Obama is almost the ideal candidate for this moment in American history . ”
Christopher Hitchens , who has spent the last five years deriding the Democratic position on Iraq as that of “ the surrender faction , ” endorsed Obama too , concluding “ the Republican Party has invited not just defeat but discredit this year , and ... both its nominees for the highest offices in the land should be decisively repudiated . ”

Whee !
Incredibly , the fun continued .
Christopher Buckley , National Review columnist and son of conservative icon William F. Buckley , also endorsed Obama : “ Obama has in him ... the potential to be a good , perhaps even great leader .
...
And so , for the first time ... I ’ll be pulling the Democratic lever in November . ”
For his pains , Buckley received hundreds of vituperative e-mails from former admirers on the right .
Effectively , he said Tuesday , he ’s been “ fatwaed by the conservative movement . ”
He resigned from the National Review .
But enjoyable as it ’s been to watch conservatives flee from the GOP , something about all this leaves me feeling a little down .
Because as the more respectable , literate conservatives distance themselves from the GOP , increasingly , the only ones left on the right are paranoid , rage - driven , xenophobic nuts .
Bitter ?
You betcha !
Twisted too !
Even for a liberal , it ’s painful to watch .
Once , the GOP proudly claimed to be the “ party of ideas . ”
They were n’t generally good ideas , it ’s true -- but they were ideas eloquently defended by men and women who believed it was their duty to study history , philosophy , science , economics and international relations and to do the intellectual heavy lifting needed to try to persuade smart people with different views to come around to their way of thinking .
That was the GOP nurtured by conservative intellectuals such as William Buckley .
Buckley was many things liberals did n’t admire , but he was n’t ignorant , savage or stupid by choice .
But today , as the last few sober grown - ups leave the party , the visible face of the GOP increasingly looks like that of the people who shout “ kill him ! ” when Obama ’s name comes up , who speak of black men they do n’t like as “ uppity ” or as “ boys , ” who think you ca n’t trust a Muslim or an Arab , who think talking about “ Barack Hussein Osama ” is witty and ( I ’m talking to you , Sarah Palin and John McCain ) who claim Obama “ pals around with terrorists . ”

This is n’t really that funny anymore .

This is how it works these days .
David Cameron wanted to establish that Tory economic policy was completely different from Labour economic policy .
And that when it all goes horribly wrong over the next year , it wo n't be his fault .
So he started on the Today programme .
He was n't to know that he would get a particularly challenging interview from Evan Davis , but no matter .
He 'd made his point .
Then it was on to the LSE in London for a speech due to start at 10.05 am .
A curiously precise time , but there was a reason .
The 24 - hour news channels , BBC and Sky , have headlines at the top of the hour .
These are generally finished after six or seven minutes , which meant they could , if they wished , go live to the Conservative leader .
So at precisely 10.05 , almost to the second , he strode out onto the stage .
Peter Sutherland , the LSE 's chairman , introduced him .
That left one minute for a little joke : " My daughter was asked what I did by the deputy editor of the Times .
She said , ' My daddy reads the newspapers for a living .
Sometimes when I 'm watching cartoons on television , he switches over and watches himself instead ' . "
Short but appreciative chuckle , which brought us to 10.07 precisely .
Lights !
Action !
Soundbites !
All the bullet points of the speech were in the first few moments : " Clear choice ... great economic problems that confront this generation ...
Labour argues that debt is not a problem and can be dealt with by unspecified people at some unspecified time in the future ... by contrast , the Conservative response ... "
By this time we had reached 10.09 , and that 's when the editors in Wood Lane and Osterley would be getting antsy .
There might be another battered child in Haringey , or a ban on cigarette displays , or exciting footage from the Irn Bru Scottish third division .
So after that , it did n't much matter what he said , except that he got it on to the record .
And it was pretty apocalyptic stuff .
The government 's plans were " useless "
They should n't just suffer , " they should be punished for a generation for their economic crimes , " he said .
We were going to be borrowing some £ 4,000 for every family .
Britain would be in the red until 2016 , " and that is on an incredibly optimistic forecast .
Labour has spent it .
Labour has blown it . "
( He loves the demotic .
You can't imagine Leo Amery telling Neville Chamberlain in the Norway debate : " You 're useless , you are .
You 've blown it . " )
Where one begins to lose him is when he retreats to generalities .
He says that the first step to economic recovery is " to fix our broken society " .
He makes it sound like something you 'd pop on the back on an envelope .
" Buy milk , phone babysitter , fix broken society " as if it was a DVD player that needed repairing .
You can imagine the conversation : " Oooh , I dunno .
I suppose I could fit you a new motivator , but frankly , with prices what they are , you'd be better off buying a brand new society ... "
Then we got onto " empowering individuals " , " coherent public service reform " , the " new , post - bureaucratic age " and " unlocking the potential of private and voluntary sectors " , and we realised that he had little to offer except intangible Blairish aspirations .
But it did n't matter .
The news channels had long moved on .

( CNN ) -- President - elect Barack Obama offered an outline of his economic recovery plan Saturday , and jobs were the top priority .
President - elect Barack Obama talks about his economic plan Saturday on a video on his Web site .
American workers will rebuild the nation 's roads and bridges , modernize its schools and create more sources of alternative energy , Obama said in the weekly Democratic address , posted on his Web site .
" The plan will mean 2.5 million more jobs " by 2011 , Obama said .
His
Web site clarified that the plan would " save or create " that many jobs .
" These are n't just steps to pull ourselves out of this immediate crisis , " he said .
" These are the long - term investments in our economic future that have been ignored for far too long . "
Details of the plan are still being worked out by his economic team , Obama said , but he hopes to implement the plan shortly after taking office January 20 .
Listen to Obama 's economic plan »
He referred to figures out this week showing that new home purchases in October were the lowest in 50 years and that 540,000 new unemployment claims had been filed , the most in 16 years .
iReport.com :
How are you making yourself layoff - proof ?
" We must do more to put people back to work and get our economy moving again , " he said .
More than a million jobs have been lost this year , he said , and " if we do n't act swiftly and boldly , most experts now believe that we could lose millions of jobs next year . "
The plan will be aimed at jump - starting job creation , Obama said , and laying the foundation for a stronger economy .
" We 'll put people back to work rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges ; modernizing schools that are failing our children ; and building wind farms and solar panels , fuel - efficient cars and the alternative energy technology that can free us from our dependence on foreign oil and keep our economy competitive in the years head , " he said .
He noted that he will need support from both Democrats and Republicans to pass such a plan and said he welcomes suggestions from both sides of the aisle .
" But what is not negotiable is the need for immediate action , " he said .
" Right now , there are millions of mothers and fathers who are lying awake at night wondering if next week 's paycheck will cover next month 's bills .
" There are Americans showing up to work in the morning , only to have cleared out their desks by the afternoon .
Retirees are watching their life savings disappear , and students are seeing their college dreams deferred .
These Americans need help , and they need it now . "
Throughout history , he said , Americans have been able to rise above their divisions to work together , he said .
" That is the chance our new beginning now offers us , and that is the challenge we must rise to in the days to come , " Obama said .
" It is time to act .
As the next president of the United States , I will . "
Schneier for TSA Administrator
It ’s been suggested .
For the record , I do n’t want the job .
Since the election , the newspapers and Internet have been flooded with unsolicited advice for President - elect Barack Obama .
I ’ll go ahead and add mine . [ … ]
And by “ revamp , ” I mean “ start over . ”
Most security experts agree that the rigmarole we go through at the airport is mere security theater , designed not to make us safer , but to make us feel safer by making it increasingly inconvenient to fly .
TSA ’s approach to security is too reactionary — too set on preventing attacks and attempted attacks that have already happened .
And please , whatever you do , resist the temptation to let TSA workers unionize .
Security from terror attacks should not be a federal jobs program .
You need the authority to fire underperforming screeners quickly and effortlessly .
Three game - changing possibilities to head up TSA : security guru Bruce Schneier , Cato Institute security and technology scholar Jim Harper , or Ohio State University ’s John Mueller .
Although I ’d be happy to see either Jim or John with it .
I do n’t want it because it ’s too narrow .
I think the right thing for the government to do is to give the TSA a lot less money .
I ’d rather they defend against the broad threat of terrorism than focus on the narrow threat of airplane terrorism , and I ’d rather they defend against the myriad of threats that face our society than focus on the singular threat of terrorism .
But the head of the TSA can’t have those opinions ; he has to take the money he ’s given and perform the specific function he ’s assigned to perform .
Not very much fun , really .
But I ’d be happy to advise whoever Obama choses to head the TSA .
The job of the nation ’s CTO would be more interesting , but I do n’t think I want it , either .

If the United States really has a critical shortage of scientists and engineers , why did n’t this year ’s graduates get showered with lucrative job offers and signing bonuses ?
That ’s the question that comes to my mind after reading about Barack Obama ’s plans to address the “ shortage ” we keep hearing about from blue - ribbon commissions of scientists and engineers .
He wants to pay for the training of 100,000 more engineers and scientists over the next four years , as my colleagues Bill Broad and Cory Dean note in their excellent analysis of the presidential candidates ’ plans to encourage technological innovation .
Now , I ’m all in favor of American technological innovation , and I ’m glad to see Mr. Obama promising to review the export restrictions that have been so damaging to the aerospace industry ( and that were promoted by John McCain because of what he called national - security risks ) .
I ’m also all in favor of American scientists and engineers , especially the ones in my family .
( My father is a chemical engineer ; my brother is an electrical engineer . )
I ’d love to see American corporations and universities frantically competing to offer them the kind of salaries paid to M.B.A. ’s and lawyers .
But employers do n’t have to throw around that kind of money because there ’s no shortage of workers — and they wo n’t be increasing their offers if the federal government artificially inflates the labor supply with an extra 100,000 graduates .
As Daniel S. Greenberg wrote in the Scientist magazine in 2003 : “ Despite the alarms , no current or impending shortage exists , and never did .
Instead , we ’re glutted with scientists and engineers in many fields , as numerous job seekers with respectable credentials can attest . ”
The only “ shortage ” is of American - born scientists and engineers .
But with so many talented foreigners competing for positions here in schools and laboratories , it ’s entirely rational for American students to head into fields where their skills are in more demand — and harder to replace with foreign labor .
Mr. Greenberg sums up their options nicely :
Consider the economic fates of two bright college graduates , Jane and Jill , both 22 .
Jane excels at a top law school , and after graduation three years later , is wooed and hired by a top law firm at the going rate – $ 125,000 a year , with a year - end bonus of $ 25,000 to $ 50,000 .
Jill heads down the long trail to a PhD in physics , and after six Spartan years on graduate stipends rising to $ 20,000 a year , finally gets her degree .
Tenure - track jobs appropriate to her rigorous training are scarce , but , more fortunate than her other classmates , she lands a good postdoc appointment–at $ 35,000 year , without health insurance or professional independence .
Three years later , when attorney Jane is raking in $ 150,000 a year , plus bonuses , Jill is nail - biting over another postdoc appointment , with an unusually ample postdoc recompense of $ 45,000 per annum .
Medicine and business management similarly trump science in earning power .
So why do we keep hearing complaints about a shortage ?
One recent reason is that it ’s been harder for foreign scientists and engineers to get visas since the Sept. 11 attacks .
But the quickest and cheapest way to deal with that problem is to increase the number of visas ( as Mr. Obama has promised to do ) .
But even if the visa restrictions are eased , the complaints about a shortage are sure to continue — they ’ve been sounded for decades .
Why ?
Well , consider who does some of the loudest complaining : administrators of university science and engineering department that stand to get more funds , and corporate executives hoping to have more future workers trained at taxpayer expense .
The blue - ribbon commissions have kept warning that America ’s future is in jeopardy if we do n’t train more native - born scientists and engineers , but I do n’t see how Americans are worse off by letting some technologies be developed and manufactured by foreigners who can do it more efficiently .
Politicians inveigh against the trade deficit in advanced - technology products , but what ’s the harm in buying computer disk drives and semiconductor chips produced more cheaply in Asian factories ?
And as long as American universities and laboratories keep attracting the world ’s best talent , why should we worry about losing our technological edge ?
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
Last spring , with the market 's rumblings growing louder , we found six asset - allocation funds that seemed like safe bets for jittery investors ( " 6 funds that let you sleep at night " ) .
As it turned out , the jitters were more than justified .
So how have our picks held up ?
They 've taken a beating , but the S&P 500 has fared worse .
Asset allocation funds , which mix stocks and bonds , are designed to buffer investors against rocky markets , and our picks were proven , steady performers .
Over the last 15 years , the biggest annual decline in the group years was a 10 % drop by Vanguard STAR in 2002 , the same year the S&P 500 index fell 22 % .
Of course , that kind of loss seems almost mild now that the S&P 500 has plunged 48 % for the year .
Since this financial crisis has affected all asset classes - including corporate bonds that serve as shock absorbers for balanced funds - all six of our picks are on their way to their steepest annual losses in over a decade .
Here 's a look at how they 've performed .
( All figures in this story are through the market close on Nov. 20 . )
GAMCO Westwood Balanced ( WEBAX )
In an annus horribilis this fund has held its own .
It 's down 28 % for the year , well ahead of the major indexes .
Much of the credit goes to lead manager Susan Byrne , a veteran stock picker who sold her stakes in troubled banks Lehman Brothers , Bear Stearns , and Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) in early 2007 .
On the fixed - income side , co-manager Mark Freeman runs a very conservative portfolio that has helped to cushion the stock drops .
" They 've taken very minimal credit risk , and over the past year and a half Mark has been rotating more and more of the portfolio into Treasuries , " said Morningstar analyst Andrew Gogerty .
Meanwhile , seasoned value investor Byrne has been sifting through the rubble to pick up high - quality stocks on the cheap : she recently scooped up McDonald 's ( MCD , Fortune 500 ) when it dropped below $ 50 .
Investors interested in this fund can find a bargain too : WHG Balanced ( WHGBX ) , a clone launched by Byrne 's Westwood Holding Group , has a lower expense ratio of 1.0 % .
Vanguard Wellington ( VWELX )
Vanguard Wellington has weathered bigger storms .
Its conservative style was forged in the Great Depression ; the fund began operations just months before the 1929 stock market crash .
Still , this has been a rough year for the $ 38 billion fund , which is down 33 % .
With a bigger equity position than many of its peers , Wellington has taken substantial hits .
One particularly painful blow : General Electric ( GE , Fortune 500 ) , the fund 's third largest holding , has plunged more than 60 % for the year .
Meanwhile , Wellington 's fixed income portfolio , which is concentrated in high - quality corporate bonds , has also been bruised .
Despite these strikes , Wellington has fared better than about 80 % of its peers .
Its long - term record continues to recommend it to patient investors : the fund still boasts a 15 - year annualized return of 7 % .
Vanguard STAR ( VGSTX )
Broad diversification , one of the fund - of - fund 's biggest selling points , has n't shielded STAR from the current crisis .
This fund bypasses individual securities with a slate of 11 actively managed Vanguard funds , but as equity portfolios got slammed this year STAR has slid 35 % .
Out of its holdings , only Vanguard GNMA ( VFIIX ) , which owns government - backed Ginnie Mae securities and U.S. Treasuries , is in the black : it 's up 4 % while the rest of STAR 's holdings have lost from 5 % to more than 50 % .
Large - cap mainstays like the Windsor and Winsdor II are down about 50 % , while growth funds like the Explorer and International Growth have plunged 52 % and 57 % , respectively .
Still , STAR has a strong record of navigating difficult climates , with 10 - year and 15 - year annualized returns that rank it in the top 20 % of its peers .
" This fund has always been pitched as a one - stop fund for a fairly aggressive long - term investor , and I think that ultimately it 's still a good mix , " said Morningstar analyst Dan Culloton .
STAR also offers quality at a bargain : the expense ratio is only 0.32 % .
Pax World Balanced ( PAXWX )
Down 38 % for the year , this socially responsible fund is firmly in the middle of the pack .
The tilt towards energy has been a big drag on returns lately : top holdings , like Baker Hughes ( BHI , Fortune 500 ) and XTO Energy ( XTO , Fortune 500 ) , are trading near their 52 - week lows .
That said , Pax World Balanced 's heavy weighting in this sector was n't a speculative play .
" A lot of these bets have been in place for years because of manager Chris Brown 's belief that demand for oil and gas will stay strong , " said Morningstar analyst Wenli Tan .
For investors who think energy stocks will rebound with a vengeance , it 's a bet that will pay off again .
Calamos Growth and Income ( CVTRX )
This $ 3.5 billion fund is a bit of an odd fit in the asset - allocation crowd , since it modifies the traditional stock - and - bond mix with big stakes in convertible securities .
That 's helped the fund rack up gains in the past , but this year is lagging behind its asset allocation peers with a 41 % decline through Nov. 20 .
" Convertibles are often touted for having an asymmetrical risk - reward profile , where you get much of the upside and a lot less of the downside , but that has n't proven to be the case in this latest downturn . " said Morningstar analyst Miriam Sjoblom .
Still , Calamos is performing in line with other convertible funds , and Sjoblom points out that the fund 's seasoned managers , John Calamos Sr. and his nephew Nick , are the right team .
" They 're two of the most experienced investors in convertibles , so we still like this fund 's prospects , " she said .
Despite the beating , the fund still boasts an annualized 15 - year return of 9 % and a 10 - year return of 6 % to outperform 98 % of its peers .
Dodge & Cox Balanced ( DODBX )
This venerable $ 15.6 billion fund has sunk 43 % this year .
A large stock position , about 70 % of the overall portfolio , has made the fund particularly vulnerable .
As of Sept. 30 , the fund 's top ten holdings included Time Warner ( TWX , Fortune 500 ) and General Electric , both down more than 55 % for the year .
Meanwhile , corporate bonds have n't held up to provide a much - needed cushion from fixed - income .
Dodge & Cox Balanced was already lagging this spring , thanks in part to soured financial sector bets from 2007 .
The managers ' early 2008 reentry into financial services proved disastrous too , says Morningstar 's Culloton , though he adds that investors should n't count this fund out just yet .
" If there 's a firm and a management team that can take a dismal experience and turn it into a learning experience to come out of it stronger , it 's Dodge & Cox , " he said .

Today 's comic will be up this afternoon .
Sorry for the delay .
Hopefully I can finally put together a buffer this weekend .
In this section , we review the model and inversion scheme of the previous section in light of established procedures for supervised and self - supervised learning .
This section considers HDMs from the pragmatic point of view of statistics and machine learning , where the data are empirical and arrive as discrete data sequences .
In the next section , we revisit these models and their inversion from the point of view of the brain , where the data are sensory and continuous .
This section aims to establish the generality of HDMs by showing that many well - known approaches to data can be cast as an inverting a HDM under simplifying assumptions .
It recapitulates the unifying perspective of Roweis and Ghahramani [ 20 ] with a special focus on hierarchical models and the triple estimation problems DEM can solve .
We start with supervised learning and then move to unsupervised schemes .
Supervised schemes are called for when causes are known but the parameters are not .
Conversely , the parameters may be known and we may want to estimate causes or hidden states .
This leads to a distinction between identification of a model 's parameters and estimation of its states .
When neither the states nor parameters are known , the learning is unsupervised .
We will consider models in which the parameters are unknown , the states are unknown or both are unknown .
Within each class , we will start with static models and then consider dynamic models .
All the schemes described in this paper are available in Matlab code as academic freeware ( http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm).
The simulation figures in this paper can be reproduced from a graphical user interface called from the DEM toolbox .
In the identification of nonlinear dynamic systems , one tries to characterise the architecture that transforms known inputs into measured outputs .
This transformation is generally modelled as a generalised convolution [ 23 ] .
When then inputs are known deterministic quantities the following m = 1 dynamic model applies ( 37 ) Here η and y play the role of inputs ( priors ) and outputs ( responses ) respectively .
Note that there is no state - noise ; i.e. , Σ w = 0 because the states are known .
In this context , the hidden states become a deterministic nonlinear convolution of the causes [ 23 ] .
This means there is no conditional uncertainty about the states ( given the parameters ) and the D - step reduces to integrating the state - equation to produce deterministic outputs .
The E - Step updates the conditional parameters , based on the resulting prediction error and the M - Step estimates the precision of the observation error .
The ensuing scheme is described in detail in [ 24 ] , where it is applied to nonlinear hemodynamic models of fMRI time - series .
This is an EM scheme that has been used widely to invert deterministic dynamic causal models of biological time - series .
In part , the motivation to develop DEM was to generalise EM to handle state - noise or random fluctuations in hidden states .
The extension of EM schemes into generalised coordinates had not yet been fully explored and represents a potentially interesting way of harnessing serial correlations in observation noise to optimise the estimates of a system 's parameters .
This extension is trivial to implement with DEM by specifying very high precisions on the causes and state - noise .
It is interesting to note that transposing the general linear model is equivalent to the switching the roles of the causes and parameters ; θ ( 1 ) T ↔ η .
Under this transposition , one could replace the D - step with the E - step .
This gives exactly the same results because the two updates are formally identical for static models , under which ( 36 ) The exponential term disappears because the update is integrated until convergence ; i.e. , Δt = ∞ .
At this point , generalised motion is zero and an embedding order of n = 0 ⇒D = 0 is sufficient .
This is a useful perspective because it suggests that static models can be regarded as models of steady - state or equilibrium responses , for systems with fixed point attractors .
If we have flat priors on the parameters , Π θ = 0 , the conditional moments in Equation ( 35 ) become maximum likelihood ( ML ) estimators .
Finally , under i.i.d. ( identically and independently distributed ) assumptions about the errors , the dependency on the hyperparameters disappears ( because the precisions cancel ) and we obtain ordinary least squares ( OLS ) estimates ; µ θ = η − y T , where η − = ( ηη T ) − 1 η is the generalised inverse .
Consider the linear model , with a response that has been elicited using known causes , y = θ ( 1 ) η+z ( 1 ) .
If we start with an initial estimate of the parameters , θ ( 1 ) = 0 , the E - step reduces to ( 35 ) These are the standard results for the conditional expectation and covariance of a general linear model , under parametric ( i.e. , Gaussian error ) assumptions .
From this perspective , the known causes η
T play the role of explanatory variables that are referred to collectively in classical statistics as a design matrix .
This can be seen more easily by considering the transpose of the linear model in Equation 34 ; y T = η T θ ( 1 ) T +z ( 1 ) T .
In this form , the causes are referred to as explanatory or independent variables and the data as response or dependent variables .
A significant association between these two sets of variables is usually established by testing the null hypothesis that θ ( 1 ) = 0 .
This proceeds either by comparing the evidence for ( full or alternate ) models with and ( reduced or null ) models without the appropriate explanatory variables or using the conditional density of the parameters , under the full model .
In nonlinear optimisation , we want to identify the parameters of a static , nonlinear function that maps known causes to responses .
This is a trivial case of the static model above that obtains when the hierarchical order reduces to m = 1 ( 34 ) The conditional estimates of θ ( 1 ) optimise the mapping g ( 1 ) : η→y for any specified form of generating function .
Because there are no dynamics , the generalised motion of the response is zero , rendering the D - step and generalised coordinates redundant .
Therefore , identification or inversion of these models reduces to conventional expectation - maximisation ( EM ) , in which the parameters and hyperparameters are optimised recursively , through a coordinate ascent on the variational energy implicit in the E and M - steps .
Expectation - maximisation has itself some ubiquitous special cases , when applied to simple linear models :
Usually , supervised learning entails learning the parameters of static nonlinear generative models with known causes .
This corresponds to a HDM with infinitely precise priors at the last level , any number of subordinate levels ( with no hidden states ) ( 33 ) One could regard this model as a neural network with m hidden layers .
From the neural network perspective , the objective is to optimise the parameters of a nonlinear mapping from data y to the desired output η , using back propagation of errors or related approaches [ 21 ] .
This mapping corresponds to inversion of the generative model that maps causes to data ; g ( i ) : η→y .
This inverse problem is solved by DEM .
However , unlike back propagation of errors or universal approximation in neural networks [ 22 ] , DEM is not simply a nonlinear function approximation device .
This is because the network connections parameterise a generative model as opposed to its inverse ; h : y→η ( i.e. , recognition model ) .
This means that the parameters specify how states cause data and can therefore be used to generate data .
Furthermore , unlike many neural network or PDP ( parallel distributed processing ) schemes , DEM enables Bayesian inference through an explicit parameterisation of the conditional densities of the parameters .
In these models the causes are known and enter as priors η with infinite precision ; Σ v = 0 .
Furthermore , if the model is static or , more generally when g x = 0 , we can ignore hidden states and dispense with the D - step .
In terms of establishing the generality of the HDM , it is sufficient to note that Bayesian filters simply estimate the conditional density on the hidden states of a HDM .
As intimated in the introduction , their underlying state - space models assume that z t and w t are serially independent to induce a Markov property over sequential observations .
This pragmatic but questionable assumption means the generalised motion of the random terms have zero precision and there is no point in representing generalised states .
We have presented a fairly thorough comparative evaluation of DEM and extended Kalman filtering ( and particle filtering ) in [ 2 ] .
DEM is consistently more accurate because it harvests empirical priors in generalised coordinates of motion .
Furthermore , DEM can be used for both inference on hidden states and the random fluctuations driving them , because it uses an explicit conditional density q( x ̃ , ṽ ) over both .
Deconvolution under HDMs is related to Bayesian approaches to inference on states using Bayesian belief update procedures ( i.e. , incremental or recursive Bayesian filters ) .
The conventional approach to online Bayesian tracking of nonlinear or non-Gaussian systems employs extended Kalman filtering [ 30 ] or sequential Monte Carlo methods such as particle filtering .
These Bayesian filters try to find the posterior densities of the hidden states in a recursive and computationally expedient fashion , assuming that the parameters and hyperparameters of the system are known .
The extended Kalman filter is a generalisation of the Kalman filter in which the linear operators , of the state - space equations , are replaced by their partial derivatives evaluated at the current conditional mean .
See also Wang and Titterington [ 31 ] for a careful analysis of variational Bayes for continuous linear dynamical systems and [ 32 ] for a review of the statistical literature on continuous nonlinear dynamical systems .
These treatments belong to the standard class of schemes that assume Wiener or diffusion processes for state - noise and , unlike HDM , do not consider generalised motion .
State - space models have the following form in discrete time and rest on a vector autoregressive ( VAR ) formulation ( 43 ) where w t is a standard noise term .
These models are parameterised by a system matrix A , an input matrix B , and an observation matrix g x .
State - space models are special cases of linear HDMs , where the system - noise can be treated as a cause with random fluctuations ( 44 ) Notice that we have had to suppress state - noise in the HDM to make a simple state - space model .
These models are adopted by conventional approaches for inference on hidden states in dynamic models :
In deconvolution problems , the objective is to estimate the inputs to a dynamic system given its response and parameters .
( 42 ) This model is similar to Equation 37 but now we have random fluctuations on the unknown states .
Estimation of the states proceeds in the D - Step .
Recall the E - Step is redundant because the parameters are known .
When Σ ( 1 ) is known , the M - Step is also unnecessary and DEM reduces to deconvolution .
This is related to Bayesian deconvolution or filtering under state - space models :
The model in Equation 41 is also referred to as a Gaussian process model [ 27 ] – [ 29 ] .
The basic idea behind Gaussian process modelling is to replace priors p( v ) on the parameters of the mapping , g( v ) : v→y with a prior on the space of mappings ; p( g( v ) ) .
The simplest is a Gaussian process prior ( GPP ) , specified by a Gaussian covariance function of the response , Σ( y|λ ) .
The form of this GPP is furnished by the hierarchical structure of the HDM .
When there are many more causes then observations , a common device is to eliminate the causes in Equation 40 by recursive substitution to give a model that generates sample covariances and is formulated in terms of covariance components ( i.e. , hyperparameters ) .
( 41 ) Inversion then reduces to iterating the M - step .
The causes can then be recovered from the hyperparameters using Equation 39 and the matrix inversion lemma .
This can be useful when inverting ill - posed linear models ( e.g. , the electromagnetic inversion problem ; [ 25 ] ) .
Furthermore , by using shrinkage hyperpriors one gets a behaviour known as automatic relevance determination ( ARD ) , where irrelevant components are essentially switched off [ 26 ] .
This leads to sparse models of the data that are optimised automatically .
The inversion was cross-validated with expectation maximization ( EM ) , where the M - step corresponds to restricted maximum likelihood ( ReML ) .
This example used a simple two - level model that embodies empirical shrinkage priors on the first - level parameters .
These models are also known as parametric empirical Bayes ( PEB ) models ( left ) .
Causes were sampled from the unit normal density to generate a response , which was used to recover the causes , given the parameters .
Slight differences in the hyperparameter estimates ( upper right ) , due to a different hyperparameterisation , have little effect on the conditional means of the unknown causes ( lower right ) , which are almost indistinguishable .
When the model above is linear , we have the ubiquitous hierarchical linear observation model used in Parametric Empirical Bayes ( PEB ; [ 8 ] ) and mixed - effects analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) analyses .
( 40 ) Here the D - Step converges after a single iteration because the linearity of this model renders the Laplace assumption exact .
In this context , the M - Step becomes a classical restricted maximum likelihood ( ReML ) estimation of the hierarchical covariance components , Σ ( i) z .
It is interesting to note that the ReML objective function and the variational energy are formally identical under this model [ 15 ] , [ 18 ] .
Figure 3 shows a comparative evaluation of ReML and DEM using the same data .
The estimates are similar but not identical .
This is because DEM hyperparameterises the covariance as a linear mixture of precisions , whereas the ReML scheme used a linear mixture of covariance components .
In static systems , the problem reduces to estimating the causes of inputs after they are passed through some linear or nonlinear mapping to generate observed responses .
For simple nonlinear estimation , in the absence of prior expectations about the causes , we have the nonlinear hierarchal model ( 38 ) This is the same as Equation 33 but with unknown causes .
Here , the D - Step performs a nonlinear optimisation of the states to estimate their most likely values and the M - Step estimates the variance components at each level .
As mentioned above , for static systems , Δt = ∞ and n = 0 .
This renders it a classical Gauss - Newton scheme for nonlinear model estimation ( 39 ) Empirical priors are embedded in the scheme through the hierarchical construction of the prediction errors , ε and their precision Π , in the usual way ; see Equation 11 and [ 15 ] for more details .
In these models , the parameters are known and enter as priors η θ with infinite precision , Σ θ = 0 .
This renders the E - Step redundant .
We will review estimation under static models and then consider Bayesian deconvolution and filtering with dynamic models .
Static models imply the generalised motion of causal states is zero and therefore it is sufficient to represent conditional uncertainty on their amplitude ; i.e. , n = 0 ⇒D = 0 .
As noted above the D - step for static models is integrated until convergence to a fixed point , which entails setting Δt = ∞ ; see [ 15 ] .
Note that making n = 0 renders the roughness parameter irrelevant because this only affects the precision of generalised motion .
In summary , we have seen that endowing dynamical models with a hierarchical architecture provides a general framework that covers many models used for estimation , identification and unsupervised learning .
A hierarchical structure , in conjunction with nonlinearities , can emulate non-Gaussian behaviours , even when random effects are Gaussian .
In a dynamic context , the level at which the random effects enter controls whether the system is deterministic or stochastic and nonlinearities determine whether their effects are additive or multiplicative .
DEM was devised to find the conditional moments of the unknown quantities in these nonlinear , hierarchical and dynamic models .
As such it emulates procedures as diverse as independent components analysis and Bayesian filtering , using a single scheme .
In the final section , we show that a DEM - like scheme might be implemented in the brain .
If this is true , the brain could , in principle , employ any of the models considered in this section to make inferences about the sensory data it harvests .
This ontology is one of many that could be constructed and is based on the fact that hierarchical dynamic models have several attributes that can be combined to create an infinite number of models ; some of which are shown in the figure .
These attributes include ; ( i ) the number of levels or depth ; ( ii ) for each level , linear or nonlinear output functions ; ( iii ) with or without random fluctuations ; ( iii ) static or dynamic ( iv ) , for dynamic levels , linear or nonlinear equations of motion ; ( v ) with or without state noise and , finally , ( vi ) with or without generalised coordinates .
This section has tried to show that the HDM encompasses many standard static and dynamic observation models .
It is further evident than many of these models could be extended easily within the hierarchical framework .
Figure 7 illustrates this by providing a ontology of models that rests on the various constraints under which HDMs are specified .
This partial list suggests that only a proportion of potential models have been covered in this section .
Each row corresponds to a level , with causes on the left and hidden states on the right .
In this case , the model has just two levels .
The first ( upper left ) panel shows the predicted response and the error on this response ( their sum corresponds to the observed data ) .
For the hidden states ( upper right ) and causes ( lower left ) the conditional mode is depicted by a coloured line and the 90 % conditional confidence intervals by the grey area .
These are sometimes referred to as “ tubes ” .
Finally , the grey lines depict the true values used to generate the response .
Here , we estimated the hyperparameters , parameters and the states .
This is an example of triple estimation , where we are trying to infer the states of the system as well as the parameters governing its causal architecture .
The hyperparameters correspond to the precision of random fluctuations in the response and the hidden states .
The free parameters correspond to a single parameter from the state equation and one from the observer equation that govern the dynamics of the hidden states and response , respectively .
It can be seen that the true value of the causal state lies within the 90 % confidence interval and that we could infer with substantial confidence that the cause was non-zero , when it occurs .
Similarly , the true parameter values lie within fairly tight confidence intervals ( red bars in the lower right ) .
Figure 6 summarises the results after convergence of DEM ( about sixteen iterations using an embedding order of n = 6 , with a roughness hyperparameter , γ = 4 ) .
Each row corresponds to a level in the model , with causes on the left and hidden states on the right .
The first ( upper left ) panel shows the predicted response and the error on this response .
For the hidden states ( upper right ) and causes ( lower left ) the conditional mode is depicted by a coloured line and the 90 % conditional confidence intervals by the grey area .
It can be seen that there is a pleasing correspondence between the conditional mean and veridical states ( grey lines ) .
Furthermore , the true values lie largely within the 90 % confidence intervals ; similarly for the parameters .
This example illustrates the recovery of states , parameters and hyperparameters from observed time - series , given just the form of a model .
In this model , a simple Gaussian ‘ bump ’ function acts as a cause to perturb two coupled hidden states .
Their dynamics are then projected to four response variables , whose time - courses are cartooned on the left .
This figure also summarises the architecture of the implicit inversion scheme ( right ) , in which precision - weighted prediction errors drive the conditional modes to optimise variational action .
Critically , the prediction errors propagate their effects up the hierarchy ( c.f. , Bayesian belief propagation or message passing ) , whereas the predictions are passed down the hierarchy .
This sort of scheme can be implemented easily in neural networks ( see last section and [ 5 ] for a neurobiological treatment ) .
This generative model uses a single cause v ( 1 ) , two dynamic states and four outputs y 1 , … , y 4 .
The lines denote the dependencies of the variables on each other , summarised by the equations ( in this example both the equations were simple linear mappings ) .
This is effectively a linear convolution model , mapping one cause to four outputs , which form the inputs to the recognition model ( solid arrow ) .
The inputs to the four data or sensory channels are also shown as an image in the insert .
In this model , causes or inputs perturb the hidden states , which decay exponentially to produce an output that is a linear mixture of hidden states .
Our example used a single input , two hidden states and four outputs .
To generate data , we used a deterministic Gaussian bump function input v ( 1 ) = exp ( 1 / 4 ( t −12 ) 2 ) and the following parameters ( 50 ) During inversion , the cause is unknown and was subject to mildly informative ( zero mean and unit precision ) shrinkage priors .
We also treated two of the parameters as unknown ; one parameter from the observation function ( the first ) and one from the state equation ( the second ) .
These parameters had true values of 0.125 and −0.5 , respectively , and uninformative shrinkage priors .
The priors on the hyperparameters , sometimes referred to as hyperpriors were similarly uninformative .
These Gaussian hyperpriors effectively place lognormal hyperpriors on the precisions ( strictly speaking , this invalidates the assumption of a linear hyperparameterisation but the effects are numerically small ) , because the precisions scale as exp ( λ z ) and exp ( λ w ) .
Figure 5 shows a schematic of the generative model and the implicit recognition scheme based on prediction errors .
This scheme can be regarded as a message passing scheme that is considered in more depth in the next section .
Blind deconvolution tries to estimate the causes of an observed response without knowing the parameters of the dynamical system producing it .
This represents the least constrained problem we consider and calls upon the same HDM used for system identification .
An empirical example of triple estimation of states , parameters and hyperparameters can be found in [ 2 ] .
This example uses functional magnetic resonance imaging time - series from a brain region to estimate not only the underlying neuronal and hemodynamic states causing signals but the parameters coupling experimental manipulations to neuronal activity .
See Friston et al . [ 2 ] for further examples , ranging from the simple convolution model considered next , through to systems showing autonomous dynamics and deterministic chaos .
Here we conclude with a simple m = 2 linear convolution model ( Equation 42 ) , as specified in Table 1 .
In the same way that factor analysis is a generalisation of PCA to non-Gaussian causes , ICA can be extended to form sparse - coding models of the sort proposed by Olshausen and Fields [ 37 ] by allowing observation error . ( 49 ) This is exactly the same as the ICA model but with the addition of observation error .
By choosing g ( 2 ) to create heavy - tailed ( supra - Gaussian ) second - level causes , sparse encoding is assured in the sense that the causes will have small values on most occasions and large values on only a few .
Note the M - Step comes into play again for these models .
All the models considered so far are for static data .
We now turn to BSS in dynamic systems .
Independent component analysis ( ICA ) decomposes the observed response into a linear mixture of non-Gaussian causes [ 36 ] .
Non-Gaussian causal states are implemented simply in m = 2 hierarchical models with a nonlinear transformation at higher levels .
ICA corresponds to ( 48 ) Where , as for PCA , Σ v = I .
The nonlinear function g ( 2 ) transforms a Gaussian cause , specified by the priors at the third level , into a non-Gaussian cause and plays the role of a probability integral transform .
Note that there are no hyperparameters to estimate and consequently there is no M - Step .
It is interesting to examine the relationship between nonlinear PCA and ICA ; the key difference is that the nonlinearity is in the first level in PCA , as opposed to the second in ICA .
Usually , in ICA the probability integral transform is pre-specified to render the second - level causes supra-Gaussian .
From the point of view of a HDM this corresponds to specifying precise priors on the second - level parameters .
However , DEM can fit unknown distributions by providing conditional estimates of both the mixing matrix θ ( 1 ) and the probability integral transform implicit in g(v ( 2 ) , θ ( 2 ) ) .
Parameters and causes were sampled from the unit normal density to generate a response , which was then used for their estimation .
The aim was to recover the causes without knowing the parameters , which is effected with reasonable accuracy ( upper ) .
The conditional estimates of the causes and parameters are shown in lower panels , along with the increase in free - energy or log-evidence , with the number of DEM iterations ( lower left ) .
Note that there is an arbitrary affine mapping between the conditional means of the causes and their true values , which we estimated , post hoc to show the correspondence in the upper panel .
The model for factor analysis is exactly the same as for PCA but allowing for observation error ( 47 ) When the covariance of the observation error is spherical ; e.g. , Σ ( 1 ) z = λ ( 1 ) z
I , this is also known as a probabilistic PCA model [ 35 ] .
The critical distinction , from the point of view of the HDM , is that the M - Step is now required to estimate the error variance .
See Figure 4 for a simple example of factor analysis using DEM .
Nonlinear variants of factor analysis obtain by analogy with Equation 46 .
The Principal Components Analysis ( PCA ) model assumes that uncorrelated causes are mixed linearly to form a static observation .
This is a m = 1 model with no observation noise ; i.e. , Σ ( 1 ) z = 0 . ( 45 ) where priors on v ( 1 ) = z ( 2 ) render them orthonormal Σ v = I .
There is no M - Step here because there are no hyperparameters to estimate .
The D - Step estimates the causes under the unitary shrinkage priors on their amplitude and the E - Step updates the parameters to account for the data .
Clearly , there are more efficient ways of inverting this model than using DEM ; for example , using the eigenvectors of the sample covariance of the data .
However , our point is that PCA is a special case of an HDM and that any optimal solution will optimise variational action or energy .
Nonlinear PCA is exactly the same but allowing for a nonlinear generating function .
( 46 ) See [ 34 ] for an example of nonlinear PCA with a bilinear model applied to neuroimaging data to disclose interactions among modes of brain activity .
In all the examples below , both the parameters and states are unknown .
This entails a dual or triple estimation problem , depending on whether the hyperparameters are known .
We will start with simple static models and work towards more complicated dynamic variants .
See [ 33 ] for a comprehensive review of unsupervised learning for many of the models in this section .
This class of models is often discussed under the rhetoric of blind source separation ( BSS ) , because the inversion is blind to the parameters that control the mapping from sources or causes to observed signals .
Neuronal Implementation
In this final section , we revisit DEM and show that it can be formulated as a relatively simple neuronal network that bears many similarities to real networks in the brain .
We have made the analogy between the DEM and perception in previous communications ; here we focus on the nature of recognition in generalised coordinates .
In brief , deconvolution of hidden states and causes from sensory data ( D - step ) may correspond to perceptual inference ; optimising the parameters of the model ( E - step ) may correspond to perceptual learning through changes in synaptic efficacy and optimising the precision hyperparameters ( M - step ) may correspond to encoding perceptual salience and uncertainty , through neuromodulatory mechanisms .
Hierarchical models in the brain .
A key architectural principle of the brain is its hierarchical organisation [ 38 ] – [ 41 ] .
This has been established most thoroughly in the visual system , where lower ( primary ) areas receive sensory input and higher areas adopt a multimodal or associational role .
The neurobiological notion of a hierarchy rests upon the distinction between forward and backward connections [ 42 ] – [ 45 ] .
This distinction is based upon the specificity of cortical layers that are the predominant sources and origins of extrinsic connections ( extrinsic connections couple remote cortical regions , whereas intrinsic connections are confined to the cortical sheet ) .
Forward connections arise largely in superficial pyramidal cells , in supra - granular layers and terminate on spiny stellate cells of layer four in higher cortical areas [ 40 ] , [ 46 ] .
Conversely , backward connections arise largely from deep pyramidal cells in infra-granular layers and target cells in the infra and supra - granular layers of lower cortical areas .
Intrinsic connections mediate lateral interactions between neurons that are a few millimetres away .
There is a key functional asymmetry between forward and backward connections that renders backward connections more modulatory or nonlinear in their effects on neuronal responses ( e.g. , [ 44 ] ; see also Hupe et al . [ 47 ] ) .
This is consistent with the deployment of voltage - sensitive NMDA receptors in the supra - granular layers that are targeted by backward connections [ 48 ] .
Typically , the synaptic dynamics of backward connections have slower time constants .
This has led to the notion that forward connections are driving and illicit an obligatory response in higher levels , whereas backward connections have both driving and modulatory effects and operate over larger spatial and temporal scales .
The hierarchical structure of the brain speaks to hierarchical models of sensory input .
We now consider how this functional architecture can be understood under the inversion of HDMs by the brain .
We first consider inference on states or perception .
Perceptual inference .
If we assume that the activity of neurons encode the conditional mode of states , then the D - step specifies the neuronal dynamics entailed by perception or recognizing states of the world from sensory data .
Furthermore , if we ignore mean - field terms ; i.e. , discount the effects of conditional uncertainty about the parameters when optimising the states , Equation 23 prescribes very simple recognition dynamics ( 51 ) Where , is prediction error multiplied by its precision , which we have re-parameterised in terms of a covariance component , .
Here , the matrix Λ can be thought of as lateral connections among error -units .
Equation 51 is an ordinary differential equation that describes how neuronal states self - organise , when exposed to sensory input .
The form of Equation 51 is quite revealing , it suggests two distinct populations of neurons ; state - units whose activity encodes and error - units encoding ξ ( t ) , with one error - unit for each state .
Furthermore , the activities of error -units are a function of the states and the dynamics of state - units are a function of prediction error .
This means the two populations pass messages to each other and to themselves .
The messages passed among the states , mediate empirical priors on their motion , while the lateral connections among the error - units , − Λξ weight prediction errors in proportion to their precision .
Hierarchical message passing .
If we unpack these equations we can see the hierarchical nature of this message passing ( see Figure 8 ) . ( 52 ) This shows that error - units receive messages from the states in the same level and the level above , whereas states are driven by error - units in the same level and the level below .
Critically , inference requires only the prediction error from the lower level ξ ( i ) and the level in question , ξ ( i+1 ) .
These constitute bottom - up and lateral messages that drive conditional means towards a better prediction , to explain away the prediction error in the level below .
These top - down and lateral predictions correspond to g ̃( i ) and f ̃( i ) .
This is the essence of recurrent message passing between hierarchical levels to optimise free - energy or suppress prediction error ; i.e. , recognition dynamics .

Schematic detailing the neuronal architectures that encode an ensemble density on the states and parameters of one level in a hierarchical model .
This schematic shows the speculative cells of origin of forward driving connections that convey prediction error from a lower area to a higher area and the backward connections that are used to construct predictions .
These predictions try to explain away input from lower areas by suppressing prediction error .
In this scheme , the sources of forward connections are the superficial pyramidal cell population and the sources of backward connections are the deep pyramidal cell population .
The differential equations relate to the optimisation scheme detailed in the main text and their constituent terms are placed alongside the corresponding connections .
The state - units and their efferents are in black and the error - units in red , with causes on the left and hidden states on the right .
For simplicity , we have assumed the output of each level is a function of , and only of , the hidden states .
This induces a hierarchy over levels and , within each level , a hierarchical relationship between states , where hidden states predict causes .
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000211.g008
The connections from error to state - units have a simple form that depends on the gradients of the model 's functions ; from Equation 12 ( 53 ) These pass prediction errors forward to state - units in the higher level and laterally to state - units at the same level .
The reciprocal influences of the state on the error -units are mediated by backward connections and lateral interactions .
In summary , all connections between error and state - units are reciprocal , where the only connections that link levels are forward connections conveying prediction error to state - units and reciprocal backward connections that mediate predictions ( see Figure 8 ) .
We can identify error-units with superficial pyramidal cells , because the only messages that pass up the hierarchy are prediction errors and superficial pyramidal cells originate forward connections in the brain .
This is useful because it is these cells that are primarily responsible for electroencephalographic ( EEG ) signals that can be measured non-invasively .
Similarly the only messages that are passed down the hierarchy are the predictions from state - units that are necessary to form prediction errors in lower levels .
The sources of extrinsic backward connections are largely the deep pyramidal cells and one might deduce that these encode the expected causes of sensory states ( see [ 49 ] and Figure 9 ) .
Critically , the motion of each state - unit is a linear mixture of bottom - up prediction error ; see Equation 52 .
This is exactly what is observed physiologically ; in that bottom - up driving inputs elicit obligatory responses that do not depend on other bottom - up inputs .
The prediction error itself is formed by predictions conveyed by backward and lateral connections .
These influences embody the nonlinearities implicit in g ̃( i ) and f ̃( i ) .
Again , this is entirely consistent with the nonlinear or modulatory characteristics of backward connections .

Encoding generalised motion .
Equation 51 is cast in terms of generalised states .
This suggests that the brain has an explicit representation of generalised motion .
In other words , there are separable neuronal codes for different orders of motion .
This is perfectly consistent with empirical evidence for distinct populations of neurons encoding elemental visual features and their motion ( e.g. , motion - sensitive area V5 ; [ 39 ] ) .
The analysis in this paper suggests that acceleration and higher - order motion are also encoded ; each order providing constraints on a lower order , through .
Here , D represents a fixed connectivity matrix that mediates these temporal constraints .
Notice that only when .
This means it is perfectly possible to represent the motion of a state that is inconsistent with the state of motion .
The motion after - effect is a nice example of this , where a motion percept coexists with no change in the perceived location of visual stimuli .
The encoding of generalised motion may mean that we represent paths or trajectories of sensory dynamics over short periods of time and that there is no perceptual instant ( c.f. , the remembered present ; [ 50 ] ) .
One could speculate that the encoding of different orders of motion may involve rate codes in distinct neuronal populations or multiplexed temporal codes in the same populations ( e.g. , in different frequency bands ) .
See [ 51 ] for a neurobiologically realistic treatment of temporal dynamics in decision - making during motion perception and [ 52 ] for a discussion of synchrony and attentive learning in laminar thalamocortical circuits .
When dealing with empirical data - sequences one has to contend with sparse and discrete sampling .
Analogue systems , like the brain can sample generalised motion directly .
When sampling sensory data , one can imagine easily how receptors generate .
Indeed , it would be surprising to find any sensory system that did not respond to a high - order derivative of changing sensory fields ( e.g. , acoustic edge detection ; offset units in the visual system , etc ; [ 53 ] ) .
Note that sampling high - order derivatives is formally equivalent to high - pass filtering sensory data .
A simple consequence of encoding generalised motion is , in electrophysiological terms , the emergence of spatiotemporal receptive fields that belie selectivity to particular sensory trajectories .
Perceptual learning and plasticity .
The conditional expectations of the parameters , µθ control the construction of prediction error through backward and lateral connections .
This suggests that they are encoded in the strength of extrinsic and intrinsic connections .
If we define effective connectivity as the rate of change of a unit 's response with respect to its inputs , Equation 51 suggests an interesting antisymmetry in the effective connectivity between the state and error - units .
The effective connectivity from the states to the error - units is .
This is simply the negative transpose of the effective connectivity that mediates recognition dynamics ; .
In other words , the effective connection from any state to any error - unit has the same strength ( but opposite sign ) of the reciprocal connection from the error to the state - unit .
This means we would expect to see connections reciprocated in the brain , which is generally the case [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] .
Furthermore , we would not expect to see positive feedback loops ; c.f. , [ 54 ] .
We now consider the synaptic efficacies underlying effective connectivity .
If synaptic efficacy encodes the parameter estimates , we can cast parameter optimisation as changing synaptic connections .
These changes have a relatively simple form that is recognisable as associative plasticity .
To show this , we will make the simplifying but plausible assumption that the brain 's generative model is based on nonlinear functions a of linear mixtures of states ( 54 ) Under this assumption correspond to matrices of synaptic strengths or weights and a can be understood as a neuronal activation function that models nonlinear summation of presynaptic inputs over the dendritic tree [ 55 ] .
This means that the synaptic connection to the ith error from the jth state depends on only one parameter , which changes according to Equation 29 ( 55 ) This suggests that plasticity comprises an associative term and a decay term mediating priors on the parameters .
The dynamics of the associative term are given by Equation 21 ( and exploiting the Kronecker form of Equation 22 ) .
The integral of this associative term is simply the covariance between presynaptic input and postsynaptic prediction error , summed over orders of motion .
In short , it mediates associative or Hebbian plasticity .
The product of pre and postsynaptic signals is modulated by an activity - dependent term , , which is the gradient of the activation function at its current level of input ( and is constant for linear models ) .
Critically , updating the conditional estimates of the parameters , through synaptic efficacies , , uses local information that is available at each error - unit .
Furthermore , the same information is available at the synaptic terminal of the reciprocal connection , where the ith error - unit delivers presynaptic inputs to the jth state .
In principle , this enables reciprocal connections to change in tandem .
Finally , because plasticity is governed by two coupled ordinary differential equations ( Equation 55 ) , connection strengths should change more slowly than the neuronal activity they mediate .
These theoretical predictions are entirely consistent with empirical and computational characterisations of plasticity [ 56 ] , [ 57 ] .
Perceptual salience and uncertainty .
Equation 51 shows that the influence of prediction error is scaled by its precision or covariance that is a function of µλ .
This means that the relative influence of bottom - up , lateral and top - down effects are modulated by the conditional expectation of the hyperparameters .
This selective modulation of afferents mirrors the gain - control mechanisms invoked for attention ; e.g. , [ 58 ] , [ 59 ] .
Furthermore , they enact the sorts of mechanisms implicated in biased competition models of spatial and object - based attention mediating visual search [ 60 ] , [ 61 ] .
Equation 51 formulates this bias or gain - control in terms of lateral connections , among error -units .
This means hyperparameter optimisation would be realised , in the brain , as neuromodulation or plasticity of lateral interactions among error -units .
If we assume that the covariance is a linear mixture of covariance components , R i among non-overlapping subsets of error-units , then ( 56 ) Where .
Under this hyperparameterisation , modulates subsets of connections to encode a partition of the covariance .
Because each set of connections is a function of only one hyperparameter , their plasticity is prescribed simply by Equation 31 ( 57 ) The quantities might correspond to specialised ( e.g. , noradrenergic or cholinergic ) systems in the brain that broadcast their effects to the ith subset of error -units to modulate their responsiveness to each other .
The activities of these units change relatively slowly , in proportion to an associative term and decay that mediates hyperpriors .
The associative term is basically the difference between the sample covariance of precision - weighted prediction errors and the precision expected , under the current value of .
As above , changes in occur more slowly than the fast dynamics of the states because they are driven by , which accumulates energy gradients to optimise variational action .
One could think of as the synaptic efficacy of lateral or intrinsic connections that depend upon classical neuromodulatory inputs and other slower synaptic dynamics ( e.g. , after - hyperpolarisation potentials and molecular signalling ) .
The physiological aspects of these dynamics provide an interesting substrate for attentional mechanisms in the brain ( see Schroeder et al. , [ 62 ] for review ) and are not unrelated to the ideas in [ 63 ] .
These authors posit a role for acetylcholine ( an ascending modulatory neurotransmitter ) in mediating expected uncertainty .
This is entirely consistent with the dynamics of that are driven by the amplitude of prediction errors encoding the relative precision of sensory signals and empirical priors .
Modulatory neurotransmitters have , characteristically , much slower time constants , in terms of their synaptic effects , than glutamatergic neurotransmission that is employed by cortico - cortical extrinsic connections .
The mean - field partition .
The mean - field approximation q ( ϑ ) = q( u(t ) ) q ( θ ) q(λ ) enables inference about perceptual states , causal regularities and context , without representing the joint distribution explicitly ; c.f. , [ 64 ] .
However , the optimisation of one set of sufficient statistics is a function of the others .
This has a fundamental implication for optimisation in the brain ( see Figure 10 ) .
For example , ‘ activity - dependent plasticity ’ and ‘ functional segregation ’ speak to reciprocal influences between changes in states and connections ; in that changes in connections depend upon activity and changes in activity depend upon connections .
Things get more interesting when we consider three sets , because quantities encoding precision must be affected by and affect neuronal activity and plasticity .
This places strong constraints on the neurobiological candidates for these hyperparameters .
Happily , the ascending neuromodulatory neurotransmitter systems , such as dopaminergic and cholinergic projections , have exactly the right characteristics : they are driven by activity in presynaptic connections and can affect activity though classical neuromodulatory effects at the post - synaptic membrane [ 65 ] , while also enabling potentiation of connection strengths [ 66 ] , [ 67 ] .
Furthermore , it is exactly these systems that have been implicated in value - learning [ 68 ] – [ 70 ] , attention and the encoding of uncertainty [ 63 ] , [ 71 ] .

The ensemble density and its mean - field partition .
q(ϑ ) is the ensemble density and is encoded in terms of the sufficient statistics of its marginals .
These statistics or variational parameters ( e.g. , mean or expectation ) change to extremise free - energy to render the ensemble density an approximate conditional density on the causes of sensory input .
The mean - field partition corresponds to a factorization over the sets comprising the partition .
Here , we have used three sets ( neural activity , modulation and connectivity ) .
Critically , the optimisation of the parameters of any one set depends on the parameters of the other sets .
In this figure , we have focused on means or expectations µi of the marginal densities , q( ϑi ) = N ( ϑi : µi , Ci ) .

Well , Republicans were saying before the election that if Obama / Biden won and McCain / Palin lost , things were going to get ugly :
Jim Nuzzo , a White House aide to the first President Bush , dismissed Mrs Palin 's critics as " cocktail party conservatives " who " give aid and comfort to the enemy " .
He told The Sunday Telegraph : " There 's going to be a bloodbath .
A lot of people are going to be excommunicated .
David Brooks and David Frum and Peggy Noonan are dead people in the Republican Party .
The litmus test will be : where did you stand on Palin ? "
Sure enough :
RedState is pleased to announce it is engaging in a special project : Operation Leper .
We 're tracking down all the people from the McCain campaign now whispering smears against Governor Palin to Carl Cameron and others .
Michelle Malkin has the details .
We intend to constantly remind the base about these people , monitor who they are working for , and , when 2012 rolls around , see which candidates hire them .
Naturally then , you 'll see us go to war against those candidates .
It is our expressed intention to make these few people political lepers .
Robert Farley has it about right :
I expect that the effort will make Palin more toxic to anyone who 's not in the Republican base , but wo n't touch her position within the base .
Sarah Palin is too big to fail .
Bill Kristol has staked his prestige on Palin 's future , and the simple fact that she thought Africa was a country is n't going to make he and his back down .
He 's too deeply invested in her , and everyone else in the conservative punditariat is too deeply invested in him .
If she crashes , everyone goes down .
I foresee two possible futures ; in one , Kristol starts walking everyone back from the brink in a year or two , and Palin 's future Presidential candidacy goes down the memory tube .
In the other , we get Sarah !
2012 , and a Goldwater style annihilation next time around .
I 'm guessing door # 2 .
Could n't happen to a more deserving bunch .
Throughout American history children have graced the halls of the White House .
Some lived there , some just visited , but they all left their mark in one way or another .

Desperate to get a Barack Obama of their own , Republicans are looking seriously at Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal , who is of Indian extraction ( not Native American Indian ) .
Jindal was interviewed by David Shuster tonight to plug his conservative credentials and pitch his solutions for the country .
It seems any ethnic minority will do , as Jindal has some serious skeletons in his closet .
On the surface , Jindal cuts an impressive figure for the Republican party , a young Oxford educated politician with a very conservative voting record .
But Jindal has some extremely dodgy views that make him completely unelectable should anyone do their research ( and yes , we do our research here at The Daily Banter ) .
In 1994 , Jindal wrote a bizzarre article for the ' New Oxford Review ' ( a right wing Catholic magazine ) about an exorcism he and his friends performed on a troubled person they knew .
Here 's a passage of the weird ( and extremely boring ) piece :

pastors , and others .
It took months before we could reestablish our
friendship and she was able to trust me .
Though I do not have the
answers she desperately seeks , I have provided comfort and support
whenever Susan has fears or doubts .
With holy water and blessed
crucifixes , I have even given her physical protection from the de­mons
that have only once reappeared , and then for a mere moment .
We have
resolved the tension in our relationship and I am developing the
ability to selflessly care for others .
It shows you how completely lost the Republican Party is if they have to rely on loons like this .
The GOP is having a very hard time finding decent politicians able to sell their barbaric policies , and guys like Jindal are their last hope .
They tried with Sarah Palin , and the public saw straight through it ( although there are an alarming amount of Republicans who want her to run in 2012 ) , and they 'll keep churning out half baked idiots until they realize that the politicians are n't the problem , it 's their philosophy .
Computing Thoughts
BitBucket / Hg vs. Launchpad / Bzr
by Bruce Eckel
November 13 , 2008
Summary
We recently moved " Python 3 Patterns & Idioms " from Launchpad to BitBucket .
Here 's why .
Advertisement
First , I want to make it clear that I think Launchpad is great , and especially the code base that it was created for , Ubuntu Linux .
The Ubuntu crew gets that Linux needs to be friendly from top to bottom , and they are doing a terrific job .
Our experience with Launchpad was good .
They do a lot of things right , and it's hard to say what , if anything , they do n't do right .
For some reason it was just a little harder than it could be .
Also , the web site had a slow response time .
The key shift happened when I decided I wanted to lower the barrier to entry for participating in the project , and a wiki seemed like the right way to do this .
If someone wants to contribute but they do n't want to learn about Spinx and distributed version control and the mechanisms of the hosting site , they can just put text into a wiki and we will take it and do whatever is necessary .
We looked at third - party wikis ( in particular , wikidot seemed very nice ) , but then someone suggested BitBucket , which has a wiki for each account .
After some brief experimentation , I decided to move the project to BitBucket and I 've been much happier with it ever since .
But the two sites provide more or less the same services , so it 's hard to pin down exactly why one seems to provide a more pleasant experience than the other .
Clearly , the speed of the BitBucket site is a significant issue .
It just feels more responsive .
But more than that , the design appears cleaner , and the use of it -- including mercurial -- just seems ... smoother , somehow .
For example , whenever you upload a package to BitBucket , the latest version is automatically ready for download in compressed format ( it does the compression for you ) by anyone .
This changed the way we organized the project , so that all the elements of interest to the end user show up at the top - level directory , then there 's a src directory where all the build stuff goes .
When you download the compressed file , you get everything , and you can just look at the book or you can look at the sources and our build system .
The result is that it 's much easier to think about and -- this is important , I think -- every time I do a push to BitBucket , it becomes the latest everything , so there 's no " now we 're going to do something special to make a distribution . "
It 's always a distribution .
Of course , you do n't have to do it this way but I found that the " implicit guidance " given by BitBucket in this direction was very helpful .
I had an observation about Launchpad 's " Blueprints " feature :
It appears that Launchpad was created with Ubuntu development in mind ( I 'm sure it was ) and so tended to funnel us in the direction of the way Ubuntu development works .
Thus , they have " Blueprints , " a specific way to add features , while BitBucket has a wiki , which allows you to do anything -- and in our case , was a better solution to the problem .
In general , I think the Ubuntu orientation of Launchpad turned out to feel a bit constraining , whereas BitBucket seems to have thought more about making a platform that is flexible for a larger number of projects .
I also found Mercurial to be more straightforward than Bazaar ; again , hard to specify exactly why but it's as if Bazaar overthinks the problem and that adds cognitive load to the learning process .
( This was definitely not a double - blind experiment ; I had already learned a little about distributed version control from Bazaar , but Mercurial still seems clearer ) .

STEPHEN Baldwin was just kidding about the promise he made on Fox News to leave the country if Barack Obama was elected president .
“ The liberal Democrats who did n’t get that I was joking need to lighten up , ” the born - again Christian told Page Six .
“ Obama is obviously talented and intelligent , and I have great respect for the man .
He ’s got my full support , and I ’m gonna be praying for him and his administration . ”
Baldwin , who hosts tomorrow ’s fund - raiser for 146 Love , a charity that seeks to end Asia ’s child - sex trade , still wo n’t support gay marriage : “ If they legalize gay marriage in all 50 states in my lifetime , I ’ll get a Billy Ray Cyrus tattoo on my butt to go with the Hannah Montana one . ”

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan ( CNN ) --
A suicide truck bombing destroyed the packed Marriott Hotel in the city of Islamabad , Pakistan , on Saturday night .
Pakistani security officials collect evidence from the estimated 10 - meter ( 33 - foot ) - deep crater Saturday .
more photos »
The attack , which occurred near the Parliament building and the prime minister 's home , killed at least 40 people and wounded another 200 , police said .
People were still trapped in the hotel , which burst into flames after the explosion caused a natural gas pipe leak , officials said .
The fire was still burning at 2 a.m. , six hours after the blast , according to The Associated Press .
Rescuers worked to move bloodied bodies from the hotel but were forced to stop out of fear that the structure could collapse .
Details and the number of fatalities are still unclear because of conflicting initial reports .
Officials said one or two vehicles was involved in the attack .
Watch a witness describe walking over bodies »
The gas leak set the top floor of the five - story , 258 - room hotel on fire , police said , and the blaze quickly engulfed the entire structure .
Mohammed Ali , an emergency service official , told the AP that rescue workers made an initial chaotic search for survivors , but rescuers could make only two trips .
Ali said that during the short forays into the hotel , they had found neither bodies nor survivors and had to retreat quickly .
" The fire has eaten the entire building , " he told the AP .
The Marriott , a Western brand - name hotel , has been the site of attacks in the past , said CNN 's Peter Bergen .
See where the attack occurred »
Police said the vehicle bomb went off about 7:30 p.m. , after the breaking of the fast during the holy month of Ramadan .
The explosion left a path of destruction -- felled trees and shattered windows -- for miles .
Watch the scene at the site of the blast »
Video showed a deep crater in the pavement where , presumably , the bomb detonated .
More than a dozen cars were reduced to twisted steel .
CNN 's Reza Sayah was inside a building more than two miles from the hotel when he felt the blast .
" It was a roaring rumble that would not stop .
Seconds later , the windows shattered . "
GEO TV's Hamid Mir , who was at the site , said he saw at least 52 bodies .
Mir said most of the fatalities appeared to be drivers who were waiting with their cars outside the Marriott Hotel and hotel staff , most of them being security guards .
An Interior Ministry spokeswoman said 257 people had been taken to hospitals and 28 confirmed dead , but government spokesman Fahatullah Babar put the death toll at " about 40 . "
A spokesman for the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences , Dr. Wasim Khawaja , said it had received 25 bodies and 106 people who were hurt , 30 of whom were severely injured .
Many of them suffered head injuries and abrasions , he said .
Watch bombing victims rushed into hospital »
Mir said someone saw the hotel gates rammed open by a small car , followed by an explosive - laden truck , which detonated .
Babar said initial reports said only a small truck laden with explosives broke through the gate .
However , the hotel manager said the blast went off outside the gates of the hotel , which is near the compound that contains the parliament building , the prime minister 's house , the Supreme Court and the presidency .
" They were able to come right up to the hotel , close to the seat of power , " Mir said .
Mohammed Asghar , who was working in a nearby office , told the AP that there was more than one man in the truck .
The men were arguing with hotel guards , a bandaged Asghar said .
" Then , there was a flash of light , the truck caught fire and then exploded with an enormous bang , " he said .
Newly elected President Asif Ali Zardari had addressed a joint session of Parliament and promised to root out terrorism just hours earlier .
A few hours after the attack , he addressed the nation on television , saying he also knows the pain of terrorism because his wife , former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , was killed in December as she was campaigning for the post .
" My heart cries tears of blood .
I can understand your pain .
I want to ask you to turn this pain into your strength , " he said , describing the extremism as " a cancer , which we will finish . "
" In the holy month of Ramadan , no Muslim can act in this way .
These people are not Muslims , " he said .
" I appeal to all democratic nations to help us get rid of this menace . "
Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik said authorities received a threat two days ago .
" We had taken all security measures , " he said .
" There was heavy security in the city . "
He described the attack as a truck bomb .
Located near the diplomatic section of the city and heavily guarded by police and military , the facility is popular among tourists and had been packed Saturday night .
Any vehicle entering the facility is searched , its underside scrutinized for bombs , before it is allowed to pass through heavy steel gates .
" The government of Pakistan has condemned it very strongly and reiterated it will not weaken the resolve of the government of Pakistan to fight the militants , " Babar said .
At least one American was killed in the attack , and several others were injured , U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said .
Ivo Zdarek , the Czech Republic 's ambassador to Pakistan , remains unaccounted for , the Czech News Agency said .
It attributed its information to officials at the Czech foreign ministry .
The Czech Embassy would not confirm the report to CNN Sunday .
The British High Commission in Islamabad said four British nationals were being treated for wounds suffered in the blast .
Two dependents of staff members were treated and released .
A spokeswoman for the German Foreign Ministry said that six Germans in the hotel were slightly hurt in the attack and that all embassy personnel were accounted for .
A U.S. Embassy spokesman in Islamabad said preliminary reports showed all U.S. diplomats accounted for .
In Washington , President Bush condemned the attack , which he described as " a reminder of the ongoing threat faced by Pakistan , the United States and all those who stand against violent extremism . "
Both U.S. presidential nominees condemned the attack .
" Today 's attack demonstrates the grave and urgent threat that al Qaeda and its affiliates pose to the United States , to Pakistan and to the security of all nations , " Democratic nominee Sen. Barack Obama said .
It was unclear on what he was basing his conclusion that al Qaeda or its affiliates were involved .
GOP candidate Sen. John McCain called the attack " an outrageous act of violence . "
" While no organization has yet taken responsibility for this act , it is well known that Pakistan faces an enduring threat from violent Islamic extremism , he said .
" We must work with the elected government of Pakistan to find those responsible , hold them accountable and diminish their ability to threaten us and our allies in the future . "
CNN 's Nic Robertson in Jalalabad , Afghanistan , and Zain Verjee in Washington contributed to this report .

The Clear Sky Chart Home Page
What is it ?
It 's is specifically intended for amateur astronomers .
The data comes a forecast model developed by Allan Rahill of the Canadian Meteorological Center .
Read from left to right .
Locate a column of blue blocks .
That 's when the sky will likely to be clear and dark .
A more detailed explanation is here , but the short version is : the clear sky chart predicts hourly cloud cover , atmospheric transparency and seeing .
( Good " seeing " occurs when the air is steady enough to allow you to see fine detail on planets through a telescope . )
That means you can plan whether to observe galaxies or planets or stay home and process image data .
If you find this image , or the underlying forecast maps , useful please email Allan Rahill .
He needs to show his bosses at CMC that his astronomy forecasts are actually being used .

Three tankers containing crude palm oil were halted by Greenpeace when they attempted to leave an Indonesian port for China and Europe .
Activists wanted to highlight the rapidly expanding palm oil industry currently destroying rainforests , harming wildlife , and emitting greenhouse gases .
The activists painted words like “ Climate Crime ” in bright yellow on the sides of the ships and then climbed one ship ’s anchor chain , preventing the ship from leaving the harbor.[ social_buttons ]
Southeast Asia ’s palm oil industry has come under attack by green groups for the deforestation caused by the cash crop .
This is not the first time Indonesia , the world ’s biggest palm oil producer , has seen Greenpeace use the tactic of blocking palm oil tankers in a bid to protest environmental concerns .
“ Today Greenpeace is taking action to expose the disastrous impacts of the palm oil and logging industries on Indonesia ’s peatlands , forests and on the global climate , ” said Bustar Maitar of Greenpeace Southeast Asia .
The blocked ships included Gran Couve , owned by the world ’s largest listed palm oil firm Wilmar International Ltd , which had been loading 27,000 tons of crude palm oil bound for Rotterdam .
The other two ships blocked at the port of Dumai in Sumatra were Smooth Sea , owned by PT Musim Mas , and Victory Prima , owned by Sarana Tempa Perkasa .
Greenpeace is calling on the Indonesian government to implement an immediate moratorium on all forest conversion , including expansion of oil palm plantations , industrial logging , and other drivers of deforestation .

( CNN ) -- Sen. John McCain played offense against Sen. Barack Obama during much of the final presidential debate as he challenged his rival on his policies , judgment and character .
Obama said he is the candidate who can bring " fundamental change " to the country and continued to try to link McCain to President Bush .
In one of the more forceful moments of the debate , McCain turned to Obama and said , " I am not President Bush . "
" If you want to run against President Bush , you should have run four years ago .
I 'm going to give a new direction to this economy and this country , " the Arizona senator said .
Watch McCain say he's no Bush »
McCain aides said they had been working on him to be more explicit in drawing a distinction between himself and Bush .
With less than three weeks before the election , it was one of several jabs McCain took at his opponent , who is leading the race in most national polls and has an 8 - point lead in CNN 's average of national polls .
A CNN / Opinion Research poll of people who watched the debate found 58 percent said Obama did the best job while 31 percent said McCain did .
Watch entire debate : Part 1 » | Part 2 » | Part 3 »
The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points , and the sample of debate - watchers in the poll were 40 percent Democratic and 30 percent Republican .
McCain touted what he called his " long record of reform " and said to Obama : " You have to tell me one time when you have stood up with the leaders of your party on one single major issue . "
Obama said he has a " history of reaching across the aisle " and pointed to his support for charter schools , pay for performance for teachers and clean coal technology .
See scenes from the debate »
" Sen . Obama , your argument for standing up to the leadership of your party is n't very convincing , " McCain said .
The third and final presidential debate took place at Hofstra University in Hempstead , New York , and was moderated by Bob Schieffer of CBS News .
Analysts weigh in on the debate »
As McCain tried to put the pressure on Obama , he told the Illinois senator that voters need to " know the full extent " of his relationship with Bill Ayers , a former 1960s radical who belonged to the Weather Underground .
" Mr. Ayers is not involved in this campaign , he has never been involved in my campaign , and he will not advise me in the White House , " Obama said .
McCain 's campaign has charged that Obama 's association with Ayers should cause voters to question his judgment .
Ayers was a founding member of the radical Weather Underground , a group that was involved in bombings in the early 1970s , including attacks on the Pentagon and the Capitol .
Obama said Ayers had committed " despicable acts " 40 years ago , but pointed out that he himself had been 8 years old at the time .
Watch what Obama says about Ayers »
Obama said Ayers has become the " centerpiece " of McCain 's campaign and said the fact that McCain keeps bringing Ayers up " says more about your campaign than it says about me . "
The Republican nominee also brought up comments made last weekend by Rep. John Lewis and pushed Obama to repudiate them .
Lewis on Saturday compared the feeling at recent GOP rallies to those of segregationist George Wallace .
" I think Congressman Lewis ' point was that we have to be careful about how we deal with our supporters , " Obama said .
" I do think that he inappropriately drew a comparison between what was happening there and what had happened during the civil rights movement , and we immediately put out a statement saying that we do n't think that comparison is appropriate , " he said .
As the candidates butted heads over tax policy , both made frequent mention of " Joe the plumber . "
Watch voters react when ' Joe ' comes up »
Last weekend , while Obama was canvassing for support in Holland , Ohio , the Democratic nominee ran into a man since dubbed Joe the plumber .
In that exchange " Joe " asked Obama if he believed in the American Dream -- he said he was about to buy a company that makes more than $ 250,000 a year and was concerned that Obama would tax him more because of it .
Obama explained his tax plan in depth , saying it 's better to lower taxes for Americans who make less money , so that they could afford to buy from his business .
At the debate Wednesday , McCain characterized Obama 's plan as trying to " spread the wealth around . "
Watch the candidates debate tax plans »
" We 're going to take Joe 's money , give it to Sen. Obama , and let him spread the wealth around .
I want Joe the plumber to spread the wealth around , " McCain said .
He added , " Why would you want to increase anybody 's taxes right now ?
Why would you want to do that to anyone , anyone in America , when we have such a tough time ? "
Obama countered that both he and McCain want to cut taxes , but that his plan would cut taxes for " 95 percent of American families , " more than McCain 's plan .
On spending , Obama promised as president he would " go through the federal budget page by page , line by line , and cut programs that do n't work , " echoing a vow his rival has made repeatedly .
McCain in turn promised an " across the board spending freeze . "
He said he would balance the federal budget in four years , and went on to name specific programs including subsidies for ethanol when Schieffer pressed both candidates to identify specific budget cuts they would make .
The candidates also talked about abortion rights , a topic not addressed in the previous presidential debate .
Watch the candidates debate abortion »
McCain refused to commit to nominating only judges who opposed abortion , saying he would " never impose a litmus test " on court nominees .
But he qualified the statement a moment later , saying he would base his nominations on " qualifications " -- and that he did not believe a judge who supported Roe v.
Wade , the case that legalized abortion , " would be part of those qualifications . "
McCain hammered Obama on abortion , accusing him of " aligning himself with the extreme aspect of the pro-abortion movement in America . "
Obama rejected the charge out of hand , saying : " Nobody is pro-abortion . "
He advocated sex education as a way of reducing the number of unintended pregnancies that result in abortions .
" We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth , communicating that sexuality is sacred and they should not be engaged in cavalier activity , " he said .
At the conclusion of the debate , Schieffer signed off with a line borrowed from his mother :
" Go vote now .
It will make you feel big and strong . "

The British Medical Journal has just published one of the greatest and funniest research articles ever to grace the pages of the medical literature with a paper on the potential neurological consequences of headbanging to heavy metal .
As someone who once caused himself concussion and several hours of puking from head banging to Metallica at the age of 14 , I feel this is important and invaluable research .
The researchers , Australian rockers Declan Patton and Andrew McIntosh , attended a number of heavy metal concerts to observe the most common forms of headbanging ( the ‘ up - down style ’ apparently ) , and then did a biomechanical analysis to estimate the forces operating on the head and brain .
They also convened a focus group of local rockers to list their favourite headbanging classics , and modelled the physical stresses based on the tempo of the tracks .
They discovered that headbanging to songs with a tempo above 146 beats per minute when the head motion was more than 75 degrees was the point at which brain injury was likely to occur .
It ’s traditional that the Christmas edition of the BMJ has a more light - hearted article .
This study is a little different in that the science is completely bona fide , but the scientific paper is a very funny read .
Their public health recommendations are a particular gem :
Though exposure to head banging is enormous , opportunities are present to control this risk ‚Äîfor example , encouraging bands such as AC / DC to play songs like “ Moon River ” as a substitute for “ Highway to Hell ” ; public awareness campaigns with influential and youth focused musicians , such as Sir Cliff Richard ; labelling of music packaging with anti-head banging warnings , like the strategies used with cigarettes ; training ; and personal protective equipment .
Great article , fantastic title , and completely open access .
Rock on !

Want the Productivity Heat Map ?
It ’s in the Content Library of our free Mighty Networks community .
Click here to join !
Productive capacity is different from what you ’re actually producing .
The way I think about it is that it ’s the amount of productivity that you ’re capable of in a given amount of time .
Of course , many different things affect your ability to be productive , so there ’s frequently a bit of difference between productive capacity and productivity .
But if you dig a little deeper , you ’ll often see that there ’s a surprising regularity in your bio - rhythms .
As I was working with people on their creative rhythms , I needed a tool to visualize and track these energy states .
The Productivity Heat Map was born .
Below is my heat map :
I ’ll provide a quick legend for deciphering colors , in case you ’re not familiar with heat maps :
Red :
This is where productive capacity is the highest .
All systems are operational and ready for the captain to give the signal to go to warp speed .
This is where I get all of my creative heavy lifting done .
I call this level the “ nova ” stage ( from “ supernova ” ) because it ’s really hot and intense , and it ’s also something quick to say to my wife so that she knows what ’s going on with me ( I get really , really frustrated by dealing with non-urgent issues during novas , since I am acutely aware of what else I could be doing ) .
Orange :
This level of productive capacity is the waystation between creative awesomeness and merely puttering along .
A lot of work can get done here , but you ’ll only be somewhat aware that you ’re working .
Yellow :
This level of capacity is the idle status .
Some productive work can be done , but it ’s not going to be the high - level , lose - track - of - time type of productivity .
Green :
At this level , I ’m spending more energy trying to keep working than actually doing the work itself .
Creativity , motivation , or focus is pretty much gone .
Gray : Hopefully I ’m asleep at this level .
Unfortunately , all too often I ’m still trying to get something done or can’t sleep because some idea is teasing me .
So , you may be wondering why I decided to present this on a modified clock face rather than the standard columnar way that we normally present time .
First , the “ heat ” of heat maps is normally mapped over something the way it actually appears .
For instance , website heat maps display the relevant information over the way the site is presented to the reader .
More important , though , I like to think about time in its natural , circular state since I get a better overview of the relatedness of yesterday ’s activities to my state today .
Lastly , it takes up less space to get the information across once you understand the paradigm .
A few other presentation notes .
I use 24 - hour time for convenience and so that there ’s no need for two clocks .
I use only four colors ( plus gray ) because they capture all of the information I need and keep me from quibbling about whether something ’s red-orange , orange , or red .
Gray is used instead of black because it ’s easier to see and black is too often associated with death or some really , really bad state .
There ’s a good deal of usefulness in thinking about your day in this way .
For me , it helps answer the following questions :
1 . Why do I have more productive capacity at some times than others ?
You ’ll notice on the heat map above that from 08 – 11 and 14 – 16 , I go nova .
Then towards meal times I start to downshift .
One obvious reason for this is that I get hungry and my blood sugar drops .
A second , less obvious , reason this happens is that I can sustain peak focus for only about three hours .
A lot of the same reasons explain why I ’m not good for a whole lot after 1600 ( 4 pm ) .
If it ’s been a good , productive day , I ’ve burned myself out by that point .
2 . How can I move from one level to the next ?
The heat map above is my ( more or less ) natural rhythm .
With a little caffeine , food , and space , it ’s what my day will generally look like .
But I ’ve often wondered what I can do to move myself from a lower level of productivity to the next higher one .
What I ’ve noticed is that I usually can shift up only one level .
For instance , I ca n’t get myself to go from yellow to red , although I can easily go from red to yellow .
( Apparently productive capacity is like heat : it goes from hot to cold pretty easily , but it takes a lot more effort to go from cold to hot . )
But moving from yellow to orange is a pretty good increase in productivity , so even making that change is worthwhile .
I ’ll discuss the specifics of this in a future post , but I ’ll give a quick example .
The block from 1100 – 1400 ( 11 am to 2 pm ) is the most malleable block of time , but it ’s often the second most important part of the day ( after the morning ) because what happens during that block determines how the rest of my day will go .
I have a few relatively simple methods for shifting that block up :
Eat a healthy , balanced breakfast – usually oatmeal with raisins , yogurt , a banana , some protein ( generally eggs ) , juice , and 8 - 16 oz of water .
Drink roughly 8 oz of water an hour .
Coordinate with my wife so that she knows I ’ll not be up for going out for lunch and will probably just grab something quick .
Turn the phone on silent , leave the phone in another room , and do n’t check email .
Eat that quick lunch – take no more than 30 minutes for prep , eating , and cleanup .
Stretch or walk for 5 - 10 minutes .
Get back to work .
Do not check email or your phone messages during lunch .
Continue to drink 8 oz of water an hour .
I told you it was relatively simple , did n’t I ?
It works because it preempts all of the things that make me naturally downshift .
The good breakfast keeps energy levels high .
The water does two things .
First , it makes you think better .
Second , it makes sure you take a break every hour or so , so you stretch , rest your eyes , and have a mini - break at regular intervals .
The coordination with Angela ( my wife ) lets her know that I ’m going nova and removes those wasted 30 – 45 minutes when we ’re both trying to figure out what the other is doing for lunch .
The quick lunch ensures that you do n’t disengage from what you ’re doing .
Not checking email and phone messages removes a lot of distractions and opens up a lot of psychic RAM .
Having the phone in the other room removes it from my view and keeps me from even thinking about it .
I ’ll warn you that if you do this , you may not be good for a whole lot of work afterward , unless you ’ve got much more mental fortitude than I do .
Just make sure you do the right things during that block so that you ’ll feel rewarded for what you ’ve done .
The plus side , though , is that I often do an entire week ’s worth of work in those six hours , so I can spend the rest of the time , all things being equal , on other pursuits .
Like writing absurdly long blog posts .
3 . How should I plan my day ?
Knowing your rhythm allows you to plan the right tasks for the right times .
I think a lot of personal planners miss this , and people look at all chunks of time as being equal .
All chunks of time are not equal !
( Tweet this . )
I can get more done from 0800 - 1000 on most days than I can from 1600 - 2000 , even though the latter block has twice as much time .
As you can probably figure out , I try to put my writing in the morning blocks since I know that I can go nova during those periods .
I may do some editing , planning , or networking during the orange blocks , and I try to check email and other low - horsepower stuff from 1600 – 1700 .
Leveraging my day like that ensures that I ’m not up at 0200 in the morning trying to work and creating a product that I ’ll spend more time editing the next morning .
It does that in two very powerful ways : 1 ) I ’m normally very satisfied with what I completed that day , as I know I could n’t have done any more than I did , and 2 ) I ’m exhausted by 2200 ( 10 pm ) or so , and if I ’m thinking clearly , I know I ’m going into a phase in which the time would be better spent sleeping .
4 . Why do I get so pissed when I wake up late ?
If I wake up past 0930 , I ’m grumpy for a long , long time because I know that the best , productive block of time is gone .
I ’ll be at half - capacity , and I ’ve got way too much that I ’d like to do for that .
So I ’ll try to work late that day , go to bed at 0445 ( I ’m not kidding ) , wake up late ( 1000ish ) the next day , get pissed , go to bed at 0330 , wake up late the next day ( 1100ish ) , and not be good for anything because I have n’t been sleeping , eating , and drinking like I should .
Luckily , I ’ll generally be so exhausted by the third day that I sleep well and can start the right rhythm over again .
But doing that loses me four nova blocks during that three - day period and those blocks are far too valuable to squander that way .
Heat - mapping your productivity is a great way to get a grip on figuring out how to be more productive and how to plan your days , and it may take a few days of recording for you to find your natural rhythm .
Get out your highlighters and markers !
And as we learned from G.I. Joe , knowing is half the battle !

PRODUCTIVE FLOURISHING
WASHINGTON -- President - elect Barack Obama is unlikely to radically overhaul controversial Bush administration intelligence policies , advisers say , an approach that is almost certain to create tension within the Democratic Party .
Civil - liberties groups were among those outraged that the White House sanctioned the use of harsh intelligence techniques -- which some consider torture -- by the Central Intelligence Agency , and expanded domestic spy powers .
These groups are demanding quick action to reverse these policies .

Three London Hospitals shut down their computer systems on Tuesday in response to a computer virus infection .
Infection by the Mytob worm sparked the emergency response , involving St Bartholomew 's ( Barts ) the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel and The London Chest Hospital in Bethnal Green .
The three hospitals are members of the Barts and The London NHS Trust .
The Trust 's website states that although operating theatres and outpatients departments remain operating as normal , ambulances are being diverted and " some non essential activities have been scaled back " .
Accident and emergency departments are open only to walk - in patients while technicians work to sort out the mess .
Doctors have resorted to pen and paper backup systems in some cases .
A computer virus has infected the Barts and The London computer system .
The Trust ’s well rehearsed emergency procedures have been activated to ensure that key clinical systems continue while network access is being established .
We have maintained a safe environment for our patients throughout the incident .
Manual backup systems are in use and we are in the process of restoring the computer systems with priority being given to the most important areas for maintaining patients services .
A spokesman for the Trust was unable to say when systems would be restored to normal .
It 's very rare but not completely unprecedented for malware infections to disrupt the operation of hospitals .
The case of a Seattle hospital infected with botnet clients is one of the few that , like Tuesday 's London incident , have provoked the roll - out of an emergency response .
The infection at Barts and London Trust was reportedly caused by the Mytob worm , which contains built - in spyware functionality .
Mytob spreads by email and has the ability to plant backdoor software on compromised Windows PCs .
Patients with concerns about their appointment are advised to contact the Trust on 0207 943 1335 . ®
Prince William Photographed Peeing on a Fence
was photographed peeing on a fence during a break at a polo match and now pictures of his manhood are all over the internet .
Perez Hilton posted links to the photos , causing the site that posted the pics to crash .
Of course now Prince William 's package is plastered all over the internet , so if one link fails , there are many others to choose from .
Prince William made headlines earlier this week as rumors spread that he is behind the Paris Hilton and Benji Madden split , however , Hilton claimed she is still in love with Madden in an interview with Ryan Seacrest this morning .
A UK commissioned report stated Tuesday that wealthy countries should pay tropical nations billions of dollars annually to save their forests .
[ social_buttons ]
The report , titled “ Climate Change : Financing Global Forests , ” offered that this money should come from private donors and global carbon markets .
The report states that by 2030 , developing nations should also be asked to pay to help create “ carbon neutral ” forests , through setting targets to help slow deforestation , and hasten reforestation .
“ Deforestation will continue as long as cutting down and burning trees is more economic than preserving them , ” said Johan Eliasch , Prime Minister Gordon Brown ’s special representative on deforestation , and author of the report .
The report estimates that funds from carbon markets alone would be able to cut deforestation rates down 75 percent by 2030 .
Carbon markets allow developing countries to earn carbon offsets for chopping down less trees than they have in the past .
These carbon offsets can then be sold to wealthy nations as a cheaper option to domestic greenhouse gas emissions curbs .
The report was criticized by some carbon traders and environmental groups , saying it down - played costs and ignored real issues such as corruption and land disputes .
However the report does recommend that donors from wealthy country should put $ 4 billion over five years towards research , and to resolve issues such as land disputes .

More from this Author I should be writing about the Wind of Hope that Barack Obama is bringing and has definitely fascinated me just like the whole world , but a thirteen year - old girl ’s news just squashed any sense of joy inside me .
The news of a thirteen year - old girl and a documentary I saw , I think , two years ago .
I ’m not sure , perhaps Asa will remember the exactly date , but a few years ago we watched the screening of a documentary in Helsinki focusing on the torture of a woman ; she was sentenced to be stoned from the Sharia law because she had a baby with another man .
Both Asa and I know the director of the film and the little respect we might have had for him dropped to unbelievable depths that day because of a question the director asked two human rights representatives in the documentary - the question first shocked us and then made us angry .
He asked them if there was any other way to … kill the woman other than inhumane stoning .
His Arabic origins are no excuse for what he asked .
You could see through the silence of the two women their shock at the question and I felt like running out of the theatre screaming .
I think the director of the film that day reached the bottom of the inhuman attitude .
How can you stone somebody ?
How this can be called justice and how dare people call the Sharia laws fair ?
But I ’d better tell you about the thirteen year - old girl .
This story is unveiled in Somalia , a country with strong Muslim beliefs and Sharia laws .
A thirteen year - old girl was raped by three men and as any normal , logic , civilized - call it as you might like - person would have done , she ran to the police station to make an accusation for the crime .
That ’s in normal countries because in countries under the Sharia law this is what happens : the girl , because she 's thirteen and not a woman , had to admit … adultery since she ’s been out of the house alone , not accompanied by a male member of her family and she was sentenced to death by stoning .
I ’m sorry but I find it difficult to find the right words to describe these animals who like to be called humans , religious , believers , ethics or anything else they want .
I find it difficult to call them humans .
Fifty men , you see , according to the Sharia law , have the " privilege " to participate in this kind of justice of stoning a thirteen year - old girl because she was raped .
These are the people who talk about the uncivilized west , these are the people who dare criticize the western way of life and these are the people who preach god !
I have said it before many times , I am one of these weird types who has read the Koran and it is a book of love and compassion like all holy books , but how can these criminals use a holy book to make crimes like that and what the punishment should be for them ?
Because they should be punished somehow .
From the moment that I read the news about the girl I have felt so angry .
I cannot understand how somebody like the Archbishop of Canterbury dared to say that we must think about the practice of the Sharia law in Europe .
What law and what justice ?
Only this example should be the reason to forbid the practice of the Sharia law internationally from the United Nations , these people are the real terrorists who have no respect at all for human life .
A thirteen year - old girl was killed because she was raped and they dare call that justice !!!
And then a ‘ reporter - director ’ who enjoys all the privileges and liberties of the western life asks if there are … other ways to kill except stoning !!!

This article is bound to provoke some reflections on the relationship of law , human rights and religion .
Perhaps some further clarifications are in order .
It is not very logical to go around advocating the elimination of laws derived from religious tenets and at the same time to advocate cultural relativism .
Cultural relativism leaves one defenseless against charges of neo-colonialism , cultural imperialism and racism and failing to respect the other .
If one advocates cultural relativism then it logically follows that each religion should have its own social laws which could turn out to be very different from each other .
Some have misguidedly advocated the elimination of religion as a radical solution to the problem but the abuse does not take away the use .
The liquidation of religion as “ poison ” ( Mao ) or as “ opium of the people ” ( Marx ) is the equivalent of taking away the use of religion because of the abuse of religion , and in the name of modernity and emancipation violating another fundamental human right , that of freedom of religion .
That is a false solution .
( continued below ) Emanuel Paparella 2008-11-06 15:31:28
Kant suggested an alternate solution to moral and cultural relativism : that for a moral law to be such it has to be universal .
Which is to say , if moral laws are not universal , they can be suspected of violating human rights once examined under the light of reason .
In other words , human rights are vested in the individual , what the founding fathers of the U.S. called “ inalienable ” rights , they are not vested in a group or a society .
The individual is born with them and it is not the state or society that grants them or can they take them away for that matter .
Therefore freedom of religion also means the freedom to leave a religion that is found unreasonable and intolerant , even the freedom to practice no religion whatsoever .
In practice that means the secular state wherein laws are made democratically but are never seen as transcending human rights that accrue to the individual and are rock bottom , and the moral law is seen as universal and not relative to a group or society or an ideology .
What logically follows from the above considerations is this question : on what does one ground universal inalienable human rights if not the power of the state or of a society ?
Is mere universal reason sufficient ?
The answer to those questions has provoked rivers of ink and is subject matter for a separate discussion .
Sand 2008-11-06 17:52:45
I really do n't need a universal moral law to be horrified by the injustices described .
Whether my disgust arises out of my particular cultural upbringing or from the abysmal stupidity of unreasoned cruelty of inflicting torture and death on fellow humans I can not say .
Apparently the US government which I assume is somehow influenced by the same cultural forces as I have been is somewhat more flexible in the matter .
Emanuel Paparella 2008-11-06 20:56:59
When Lord William Buntinck , one of the governor of India in the 19th century insisted on the elimination of Sati ( widow burning ) from Indian society despite the insistence on the part of the elders of that society that it had its foundation in the traditions sanctioned by their holy scripture ( the Rig Veda ) he had three options before him :
1 . The bully Machiavellian option .
He could have told the elders that he did not care a fig about their religious customs which were cruel and stupid in any case .
He was in charge , albeit in their home , and what he said went .
In a relativistic world all customs may be equal but he who has the power dictates the law .
2. The Kantian rational solution .
He could have made a case that human rights are universal , based on universal reason and universally applicable and that they do not contradict any genuine religion who respects reason and freedom .
The Kantian solution .
3 . The Imperialist solution .
Pit one custom against another and support it with the legality of law and power .
He was too good of a governor and diplomat to adopt n. 1 as a colonizer lording it over in somebody ’s else home .
He chose n. 3 telling the elders that he too had a custom that he intended to apply , that of hanging those who burned widow .
Certainly n. 3 was better than n. 1 , even admirable to a certain extent : not power makes right ( n. 1 ) but power for right ( n. 3 ) .
But he would have been by far wiser had he chosen n. 2 : the universality of human rights in harmony with freedom of religion .
The Hindus would have understood that appeal to universal laws much better than the threat of raw power and the positive law made by a conqueror .
The chickens have now come home to roost : the English have to decide on what grounds they wish to outlaw Sharia law among Muslims living in England .
I think that n. 2 , the Kantian position is still the best .
Sand 2008-11-06 21:16:29
The judgment as to whether abysmal customs should be permitted or not is separate from the methods used to administer justice .
The American south treated black people like inferior animals for a hundred years until the federal government sent in the military to see to it that federal law was obeyed and little black kids could attend school .
No doubt the problem is still not entirely solved but without force it never could have started to be solved .
AP 2008-11-07 02:50:40
Yes , that 's disgusting .
Had heard about it before .
Other ways to kill ?
I could suggest the director to shoot from a helicopter ... no , wait ... where did I hear that before ?
AP 2008-11-07 03:01:53
The director could try " other smoother ways to kill " ... himself , like :
1. electrocuted by a movie camera , or multiple cameras
2. chewing his sadistic tongue to death
3. trying to seize the depts of the ocean
4. drowning on the swamps of a swine farm .

Well , with this " multiculturalism " that is being pushed upon Finland thats what we 'll be having in a few years .
Hank W. 2008-11-27 18:33:02
Wow ,
Thanos , you 're being such a racist .
Now as we know from all these multiculturalism workshops you may not say the stupid foreigners are being stupid because you might hurt their feelings .
You have to cherish the enrichment they will bring to our culture when they follow their traditions .
Naughty naughty naughty .
Someone might be thinking you have been reading Halla - aho or voting " True Finns " when you write something like this .
You evil neonazi you , really cannot you see the beauty of a multicultural society with sharia for all ?
After all its just us wicked Finns that want everybody playing with the same rules .
Ruby 2008-12-10 21:19:42
Hey ,
Actually I 'm a muslim and that 's barbaric - thats not islam - they are not follwing sharia law .
They are following their own laws .

Pictured : The ' Buddha boy ' who emerged from Nepal 's jungle after spending a year alone
A teenage boy who many believe is the reincarnation of Buddha has re-emerged from the jungle in southern Nepal , attracting thousands of devotees , officials said today .
After retreating into the jungle for more than a year , Ram Bahadur Bamjan , 18 , re-emerged Monday near Nijgadh town , about 100 miles south of the capital , Katmandu .
Upon hearing the news , thousands of Bamjan 's followers , some from as far away as India , traveled to the site Tuesday to see him , police official Abhaya Joshi said over the telephone .
Joshi said Bamjan plans to talk to his followers for a few hours every day for a week before returning to the jungle to meditate .
Ram Bahadur Bamjan is believed to be the reincarnation of Buddha .
He blesses a Buddhist monk in Nijgadh town , about 100 miles south of Katmandu
Bamjan , 18 , emerged from the jungle in southern Nepal after spending more than a year alone
The long - haired Bamjan , dressed in a white cloth , appeared to be in good health as he spoke to his followers about peace and ending discrimination , according to the Rajdhani newspaper .
' It was an amazing experience to hear and see him .
I have no doubt now he is the reincarnation of Buddha , ' said Sangeeta Lama , a woman who met Bamjan for the first time .
Buddhist priests have been divided on whether the boy is truly the reincarnation of Siddhartha Gautama , who was born in southwestern Nepal around 500 B.C. and later became revered as the Buddha , which means Enlightened One .
Buddhists strongly believe in reincarnation , the doctrine that every soul reappears after death in another bodily form .
Bamjam sits on a podium surrounded by monks who have travelled hundreds of miles to receive his blessing
There has been no formal declaration by Buddhist authorities that Bamjan is the reincarnation of the Buddha .
But people have worshipped the teenager since he was first seen in 2005 meditating in the jungle , where he sat for months , motionless with his eyes closed among the roots of a tree .
Min Bahadur Shakya of the Nagarjuna Institute of Exact Methods in Katmandu said Buddhist priests have not reached a conclusion about Bamjan because they have not been able to fully investigate the boy .
' Meditating without food does not prove that he is reincarnation of Buddha .
There is much study needed to be done , ' Shakya said .
Buddhism is practiced by about 325 million followers , mostly in Asia .
All spiritual experiences are based in the brain .
That statement is truer than ever before , according to a University of Missouri neuropsychologist .
An MU study has data to support a neuropsychological model that proposes spiritual experiences associated with selflessness are related to decreased activity in the right parietal lobe of the brain .
The study is one of the first to use individuals with traumatic brain injury to determine this connection .
Researchers say the implication of this connection means people in many disciplines , including peace studies , health care or religion can learn different ways to attain selflessness , to experience transcendence , and to help themselves and others .
This study , along with other recent neuroradiological studies of Buddhist meditators and Francescan nuns , suggests that all individuals , regardless of cultural background or religion , experience the same neuropsychological functions during spiritual experiences , such as transcendence .
Transcendence , feelings of universal unity and decreased sense of self , is a core tenet of all major religions .
Meditation and prayer are the primary vehicles by which such spiritual transcendence is achieved .
“ The brain functions in a certain way during spiritual experiences , ” said Brick Johnstone , professor of health psychology in the MU School of Health Professions .
“ We studied people with brain injury and found that people with injuries to the right parietal lobe of the brain reported higher levels of spiritual experiences , such as transcendence . ”
This link is important , Johnstone said , because it means selflessness can be learned by decreasing activity in that part of the brain .
He suggests this can be done through conscious effort , such as meditation or prayer .
People with these selfless spiritual experiences also are more psychologically healthy , especially if they have positive beliefs that there is a God or higher power who loves them , Johnstone said .
“ This research also addresses questions regarding the impact of neurologic versus cultural factors on spiritual experience , ” Johnstone said .
“ The ability to connect with things beyond the self , such as transcendent experiences , seems to occur for people who minimize right parietal functioning .
This can be attained through cultural practices , such as intense meditation or prayer or because of a brain injury that impairs the functioning of the right parietal lobe .
Either way , our study suggests that ‘ selflessness ’ is a neuropsychological foundation of spiritual experiences . ”
The research was funded by the MU Center on Religion and the Professions .
The study – “ Support for a neuropsychological model of spirituality in persons with traumatic brain injury ” – was published in the peer - reviewed journal Zygon .
“ Our research focused on the personal experience of spiritual transcendence and does not in any way minimize the importance of religion or personal beliefs , nor does it suggest that spiritual experience are related only to neuropsychological activity in the brain , ” Johnstone said .
“ It is important to note that individuals experience their God or higher power in many different ways , but that all people from all religions and beliefs appear to experience these connections in a similar way . ”
While we may have lost this particular battle , we certainly have n’t lost the fight .
We and are allies mobilized like never before , and along the way I ’m sure there were many acts of courage , both large and small , that made the margin between Yes and No razor thin .
Below is one such story .
Gino VanGundy did something many of us would not have the courage to do : engage a “ Yes on 8 ” supporter in their home and share how we feel about the issue , in the hopes of getting them to rethink their perceptions about marriage equality , and perhaps , us .
But often we fall back on those feelings that kept us in the closet when confronting total strangers we fear are against us , to share who we are and where we stand .
This makes Gino ’s story all the more relevant .
If you have any stories or someone you would like to give tribute to or who inspired you , please email me at [ email protected ] .
I would love to post them here to inspire members of our community to be proud of who they are , to take a stand , and to make a difference .
Here ’s Gino , in his own words , just a few days before the election …
Do you live in the suburbs ?
Are you tired of seeing the YES on Prop 8 signs everywhere and feeling like our voices are being drowned out by those that want to deny us ( or your friends ) our civil rights ?
I , for one , AM !
They have even been coming to my front door .
I have always taken the “ nice guy ” approach with them because mamma always said , “ you can get much further with a teaspoon of honey than you can with a teaspoon of vinegar . ”
Speaking with them has been interesting , at best , but each time one leaves I find myself wondering , why the NO folks are n’t out there going door to door too .
They have been coming to my door specifically because of the NO signs I have in my yard .
Why should n’t we do the same ?
About two weeks ago , as we were driving out of town on our daily trek from Fairfield to San Francisco ( at 6 am ! ) we were greeted by the largest YES banner we had ever seen !
It was huge and stood about 12 feet in the air , was at least 6 feet wide and 4 feet high .
Every morning for the last two weeks we have seen that sign staring down at us .
To say that it has been an unpleasant way to start our day would be an understatement .
Today it hit me !
If they can come to my front door , why ca n’t I go to theirs ?
I was admittedly terrified but decided that my first stop would be the house with the gigantic banner .
I sat in my car for at least ten minutes as I mustered up the courage to actually ring the door bell .
I thought , “ deep breaths Gino , and just put one foot in front of the other ” as I walked up the front walkway .
I rang to doorbell and every natural instinct I had told me to run like hell !
I stayed put and just as I was about to high - tail it out of there I heard the locks on the front door start to click .
I was stuck !
UGGH !
As the door slowly opened I was greeted by an older African American woman of about 75 .
Behind her stood a younger African American woman that was staring me down like I was not someone to be trusted .
I smiled and introduced myself as a neighbor .
I went on to ask them if they might be willing to discuss the banner that was looming over the busy street below .
I sensed some indignation as in “ who the hell are you to be telling me that I ca n’t put any damn sign I want in my yard ? ”
I backpedaled and let them know that I believed it to be their right to hang whatever sign they choose and I went on to tell them that I was not there to attack them on their personal beliefs .
I told them I was there to offer them a point of reference when thinking about the impact a YES vote on Prop 8 would have .
“ Well , what ’s it matter to you ?
What are YOUR thoughts on the issue , ” the younger woman said as she stepped out from behind the older woman .
I took a big gulp and leapt right in !
“ Well , ” I said , “ for starters , I ’m gay and the passage of Prop 8 would eliminate my right to equality under our Constitution . ”
Suddenly the older woman ’s face softened and she said , “ Well my sister works in San Francisco and she has a lot of gay friends and she wants me to take that damn thing down . ”
I saw an “ in ” but I waited for her to finish .
“ All this stuff is just too confusing to me !
I ’m not even a registered voter .
Some guy knocked on my door and asked if he could put a sign in my yard to support some proposition .
I told him that I did n’t care and the next time I went outside I looked up and saw this gigantic sign in MY BACKYARD ! ” “ I never agreed to let him in my backyard he must have had a ladder because my gate is always locked . ”
“ I ’m just too old to get up there and take that thing down . ” I had my in !
“ Oh , well if you ’d like ME to take it down , I ’d be happy to do that for you ! ”
“ Fine by me , ” she said .
Unfortunately they did not have the key to the gate but I told them that I was more than happy to come back later when the person that had the key had returned .
An hour later my daughter and I returned with our tools in hand and they happily let us into the backyard .
Down came the sign , hugs given by all and my daughter and I expressed our sincerest appreciation as we left .
If you have thought of knocking on doors , now is the time .
We have to get out and educate those that are blindly following , or worse , have been tricked into supporting something they do not fully understand .
Be heard “ stand up ” and take the lumps that will surely come but know that there are people out there that support us but need some help to do it .
One sign and one person at a time we can , at minimum , start to turn this dangerous tide .

This is a guest post from my wife Jacki .
I thought it ’d be interesting to get the views of someone who has no real interest in social media and let them explain why .
And one thing I love about Jacki is her no-nonsense approach to everything .
To learn more or connect with Jacki , please visit her blog Just Kickin ’
It .
I was recently asked my views on social media and all the glorious tools therein .
Truthfully , my mind went blank .
I could n’t tell you the difference between Twitter and Stumbleupon .
I understand Google as a search engine , so when someone says ?
She found me on Google ? ?
well , that makes sense .
But what the heck does ?
She sent me a tweet ?
mean ?
This is a hypothetical question , don?t answer it ?
I don?t care and will likely forget what it means anyways .
If I need to find something I Google it .
If I ?ve read something I liked and am able to comment I will , if not , well my opinion doesn?t mean a whole lot anyways .
I ? m not overly devastated if I don?t get to share it .
I recently started a new blog .
I still don?t fully understand what that even means .
What I do is I write a virtual journal , I rant about the latest current affairs , I discuss in great detail all of the things that irritate me and what the world could do to improve .
Mostly it ?s social etiquette and common sense .
When I ?m bored and feeling creative , I might tell a story or two , involving a little bit of research on my part .
I assume since it ?s on the Web , anyone can read it .
Great , go for it .
I just learned what it meant to ? tag ? , something which makes sense , but I still don?t know how to do it .
So if you can ?t find me , well I guess that ?s my fault too .
For this I use Blogger .
I tried to post a couple of pictures on my recent blog and what a pain that was .
I think I?ll stick to journal format from now on in .
It ?s a personal blog , not professional .
It doesn ?t have any business purpose , so I ? m not trying to draw in any clientele .
My other blog , I run with a couple of other ladies .
This is a virtual book club .
It ?s a bit different than the regular book clubs but it suits its purpose .
We use WordPress for this .
I can honestly say that after playing with it a bit , it ?s far more user - friendly than Blogger .
And I ?ve mastered the art of adding pictures .
I think that deserves a pat on the back right there .
Facebook is a given .
But someone listed a bunch of other nonsense :
Twitter
Stumbleupon
Digg
Friendfeed
LinkedIn
Delicious
Reddit
Google Alerts
Google Reader
Monitter
Technorati
What is all of this ?
It ?s a foreign language to me .
If you want me to read something , send me a link .
I really couldn?t care less what you use to spread the word , or what format you put things in .
I ?m glad it works for you , really I am .
But are all these things really necessary ?
Take Stumbleupon for example .
There was probably about a month where my husband went nuts with sending me a bunch of things he stumbled upon .
One day I watched him send out an email .
He had to cut here , paste there , click a few buttons and voila !
Seems simple , right ?
Why the heck couldn?t he just paste the link in a normal email and send that out ?
Why go through Stumbleupon at all ?
And Twitter ?
This one I can ?t get over because it ?s all the new rage amongst Social Media Experts and PR Gurus .
I guess I don?t understand the Internet world , and what is the point of learning it when it changes on a daily basis ?
I use Blogger , WordPress and Facebook .
But really , if I want to write something and share it , is there any difference if I use Microsoft Word or Notepad ?
Couldn ?t
I just use that and send it off to whomever I want to read it ?
If I want it to go public , then using some domain might be an idea , but does it really matter one way or the other what the heck I put it in ?
Can you tell the difference between Blogger and WordPress , as a reader ?
Maybe one is more appealing to the eye than the other but it ?s more of the same .
So go on and speak your language .
But in plain English , you could just tell me , ?
Here ? read ?.
Thanks for listening .
Chinese Democracy is the band 's first album in 15 years China has dismissed the new Guns N' Roses album , Chinese Democracy , as a " venomous attack " on the nation .
An article in the Global Times , published by the ruling communist party , says the album , launched this week , " turns its spear point on China " .
The title track of the album , which has not been released in China because of the sensitive material , refers to the banned Falun Gong spiritual group .
The album 's official website has also been blocked in China .
Chinese Democracy is the band 's first album since their covers collection The Spaghetti Incident ? in 1993 .
Pirate copies
On the title track , lead singer Axl Rose sings : " If your great wall rocks , blame yourself . "
Artwork for the album includes the oil painting Red Star by Beijing artist Shi Lifeng - which depicts Chinese people as powerless .
According to my knowledge , a lot of people do n't like this kind of music because it's too noisy and too loud
Government spokesman Qin Gang
James Reynolds ' China Photographs of the Chinese military and the Hong Kong skyline also feature in the artwork .
When asked about the record , foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang told the BBC's James Reynolds : " According to my knowledge , a lot of people do n't like this kind of music because it 's too noisy and too loud . "
China frequently bans the release of foreign films and albums , although they often appear in pirated form and are sold in shops and by street vendors .
Bjork landed herself in hot water with Chinese authorities Live performances are also closely monitored with artists forced to supply set lists for approval in advance .
In July , the Chinese government said that any foreign entertainers who had attended events threatening " national sovereignty " would be banned from the country .
The ministry of culture said that any artists that " whip up ethnic hatred " during shows would also be banned .
The announcement came after Bjork shouted " Tibet , Tibet " at a Shanghai concert in March .
Any talk of Tibetan independence is considered taboo in China , which has ruled the territory for more than 50 years .

Australia 's series defeat in India will hit the cricket - loving inhabitants of Sydney , Melbourne and Perth hard .
It gives those who have not rejoiced in an almost 15 - year period of Australian dominance the opportunity for bravado too .
And it 's true , Ricky Ponting 's side is a shadow of that which walloped England 5 - 0 in 2006 - 07 .
But if the cricket world believes that is that from the Aussies , it had better think again .
The defeat , like that in the 2005 Ashes , will lead to soul - searching but those in charge of Australian cricket will not sit down and feel sorry for themselves .
They will not panic .
They will assess what they need to do and plan a way forward .
Australia 's small population means that it does not have as many potential cricketers as India , Pakistan or England .
But the drawback is overcome by the investment made by central government , the facilities available and the fact that the sport attracts many of Australia 's best athletes .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Despite what some say , cricket in Australia is still strong .
At first - class level there are dozens of talented , committed and ambitious young men .
The sole goal of each is to follow in the footsteps of Don Bradman , Dennis Lillee , Steve Waugh and Warne , and wear the Baggy Green .
In England , last summer 's averages were dominated by players with a southern hemisphere , rather than south of England , twang .
Many see Australia 's National Cricket Academy as the source of the game 's strength , but it is actually grade cricket – league cricket – that underpins the game .
Thousands of fit young men take part in well - organised , almost professional , practice sessions on a Tuesday and Thursday evening .
On a Saturday , they play highly competitive cricket on excellent pitches .
A friend of mine , playing second grade cricket in Sydney at the time , believed he was 10 innings away from a Baggy Green – and he was .
Australia are still ranked the best side in the world , and they will continue to challenge for top spot .
They will not rule as they have but , equally , they will not become a New Zealand or West Indies .
By concentrating on Australia 's demise , we overlook one important fact – how good India have become .
Those England fans who believe the Ashes are for the taking had better hold fire until Christmas .
If Kevin Pietersen 's side struggle in India the 2009 Ashes will decide only who the second or – if South Africa beat Australia in the coming months – third best team are .
It is a world of encrypted laptops , unmarked mail and the briefest stops in multiple hotels .
Accusations by US prosecutors this week shed a fascinating light on the allegedly cloak - and - dagger world of UBS , Switzerland 's biggest bank .
A grand jury in Florida has charged one of UBS 's top executives , Raoul Weil , with helping 17,000 Americans to avoid tax by safeguarding their money in secret Swiss bank accounts .
Weil , who is based in Zurich , is the head of UBS 's wealth management division , and his prosecution is likely to cause deep alarm at the highest levels of Switzerland 's banking establishment .
" There 's enough in this indictment , if you read between the lines , to suggest that UBS has a serious problem here , " says Bradley Simon , a former federal prosecutor at law firm Simon & Partners .
" They 're making some really serious allegations that go to the heart of UBS . "
The US department of justice has been gunning for UBS for many months .
It alleges that the bank aggressively pushed its services to US citizens through none - too - subtle nudges about tax - avoidance benefits .
Between 2002 and 2007 , some 20,000 American clients had private accounts at UBS with a hefty $ 20 bn in total assets .
Florida 's federal prosecutor , Alexander Acosta , who is leading the charge against UBS , says 17,000 of these clients concealed their accounts from the Internal Revenue Service .
Secret off - shore bank accounts are nothing new .
But what appears to have enraged the US authorities are UBS 's tactics .
According to the indictment , UBS at one stage had customers signing a form which said : " I would like to avoid disclosure of my identity to the US IRS . "
Letters to clients assured them that since 1939 , the bank had been successful in concealing the identity of account holders from the US authorities .
There was even a training course for staff in September 2006 on how to conduct business discreetly – by using mail without UBS insignia , by using encrypted computers and " by changing hotels while travelling " .
It all sounds a bit James Bond – and it gets worse .
A former UBS staffer , Bradley Birkenfeld , who is cooperating with the authorities , claims he once used a toothpaste tube to smuggle diamonds across an international border for a bank client .
The charges against Weil carry a potential sentence of five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine , so the 49 - year - old is unlikely to be keen to hop on a transatlantic flight from Zurich .
But if the bank ignores the indictment , UBS could face severe consequences – perhaps an indictment against the institution or a threat to its US banking licence .
" The justice department will be putting enormous pressure on UBS and possibly threatening an indictment against the bank , " says Simon , who believes such a move could be shattering for the reputation of a large financial institution .
" Remember Arthur Andersen ?
When they were indicted , it spelt the end for them . "
Switzerland rarely allows its citizens to be extradited to face charges abroad – and its national laws require banks to respect clients ' privacy strictly .
But there is a loophole : if there is evidence of criminal activity , Swiss banks can provide information to cooperate with law enforcement authorities .
UBS provided a bland statement saying Weil was relinquishing his duties until the matter was resolved .
It added : " UBS is fully committed to continuing its efforts to cooperate with the investigation of its US cross - border business in a responsible manner with all relevant authorities towards a satisfactory resolution of this matter . "
The drama is the last thing UBS needs .
In common with rival banks across Europe and the US , it has been scorched by the global financial crisis , writing off more than $ 40bn of losses on toxic assets .
Its longstanding chairman , Marcel Ospel , quit in April , admitting to " mistakes " amid shareholder unrest .
America 's assault on Switzerland 's banking secrecy is causing ructions in Zurich .
A report in one paper , the Tages - Anzeiger , this week accused the US treasury of covertly tracking transactions between 100 Swiss institutions through international computer systems used for transaction clearance .
The paper named a system called Remotegate and claimed that the Americans were using tools designed to tackle international terrorism .
The Swiss government is being tight - lipped .
A spokesman at Switzerland 's embassy in Washington would only say : " The embassy was informed by the department of justice of the charges brought against Mr Weil . "
The US authorities want the names of UBS 's 17,000 wealthy American clients .
If it hands them over , the Swiss bank will set a highly significant precedent not only for its rivals in Switzerland but for banks in tax havens around the world which operate in the US .
If all 17,000 customers are forced to stump up tax , it could be a decent earner for the US treasury .
Perhaps the money could even end up back in the banking system , helping to fund Henry Paulson 's $ 700 bn bail - out of America 's own teetering financial institutions .

Automobiles have become an integral part of life over the past century .
Unfortunately , the idea of sustainable transport was n’t considered until more recently .
Limited performance models powered by hydro motors and those operating on electricity were quickly forsaken for the power and convenience of gasoline and diesel engines .
Why Petroleum Based Fuels Are Not the Answer
According to the American Petroleum Association , spills and leaks from offshore drilling rigs contaminate the oceans with nearly 15 million gallons of oil per year .
Oil rigs pose a number of environmental hazards to the water and animals surrounding them , as well as those working on the rigs – not to mention the fact that petroleum is a nonrenewable resource that may or may not be available in the future .
Obviously , our dependency on gasoline is something that must be overcome .
The potential of electricity , hydrogen power , and alternative fuels are once again being examined by car manufacturers around the globe – and this time , the future for sustainable transport is bright .
Biofuels and Ethanol – A Quick Fix or a Solution ?
The importance of biofuel and biodiesel have been considered for nearly 3 decades , but has seen much more attention since 2006 .
Several countries have put plans in place to convert fuel use to bio-alternatives within the next few years .
These alternative fuel options are much cleaner than petrol - based fuel without the harsh impact and hazards associated with drilling , but ethanol - based biofuels have their share of environmental concerns as well .
First - generation biofuels typically convert naturally - grown plants into ethanol or vegetable oil – then it is processed into fuel .
These crops , and the process of photosynthesis , remove carbons from the air and are thought to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % over conventional fuels .
Biofuel production has seen quite a bit of controversy for a number of reasons , but primarily because corn and grain crops are cultivated strictly for ethanol or vegetable oil production – thus detracting from our global food supply .
Increased demand to meet the needs of both food use and ethanol or oil production has created a significant rise in food costs .
The most recent debate over the worth of biofuels may be the greatest concern – recent studies have found that ethanol production for fuel may actually accelerate global warming , causing more harm than good in the long run .
Acres and acres of land have been converted from the carbon - reducing forests and grasslands they once were to crops of soy , corn , or sugarcane for biofuel .
Scientists estimate that palm oil plantations in Indonesia will require more than 400 years to actually benefit the world .
Beyond First - Gen Biomass Fuels
Corn , sugarcane , soybeans , and other consumable crops are not the only option for biofuel production .
Perennial plants cultivated on already degraded farm land is one option currently being examined – the key to sustainable transport is finding a solution that will not alter the natural cycle of the environment .
The possibilities for biomass are seemingly endless – some options may include :
Hybrid and Electric Success
From tax - incentives and reduced bank loan rates to the freedom of driving in any HOV lane regardless of occupancy , hybrid vehicles are thought by many to be one of the biggest advancements in sustainable transport .
Today ’s hybrids greatly reduce emissions , are much roomier than early models – check out the Lexus RX Luxury Utility Vehicle , and can go much further and faster on a charge .
Unfortunately , typical hybrid vehicles still depend on gasoline .
Advancements in battery technology have paved the way for 100 % electric cars , completely independent of nonrenewable fuels .
The Tesla Roadster features all the fun and excitement of a luxury sports car – 0 to 60 in 3.9 and a top speed of 125 – for less than 2 cents per mile .
Electric cars may play a big role in the future of sustainable transport but there are still disadvantages that will need to be overcome before electric power is the answer .
The battery that powers hybrids and electric cars pose the greatest threat .
Lead batteries are extremely dangerous in accidents while lithium - ion batteries can cause greater fire hazards .
Disposing of these toxic components can also create environmental dangers .
Electric cars require charging , just like your laptop and mobile phone .
Limited driving around town is ideal , but longer commutes , vacationing , and other drives will require plug - in stations that are currently few and far between .
The Power of Nature Meets Modern Transport
There are many other possibilities currently being tested in the world of transportation .
Hydrogen powered vehicles are already on the road but are still quite costly to manufacture and to operate .
Solar power is another viable option for the future .
From the strange and disgusting materials considered for biomass fuel to the natural rays of sunlight needed for solar power , the options available for alternative fuel and sustainable transport are amazing – and there is still so much more to discover as we search for automotive independence .
What do you consider to be the most viable option for renewable fuel ?
What is the most unusual ?
LONDON ( Reuters ) -
The first phone to be built on Google ’s Android operating system , which T - Mobile is selling for $ 179 in the United States , costs $ 144 for the components and materials , research firm iSuppli said .
The T - Mobile G1 , made by Taiwan ’s HTC , has a touch screen and full keyboard as well as popular Google applications such as search , maps and mail .
And it is considered the most likely contender to the iconic status of Apple ’s iPhone .
The company iSuppli said its “ bill - of - materials ” estimate , which does not include costs for software , research and development , manufacturing or accessories , was based on a cost model rather than a physical examination of the phone .
It has not yet conducted a physical teardown to determine whose components are inside the phone , but said on Tuesday the G1 contained a multimedia microprocessor and modem core designed by Britain ’s ARM .
As well , iSuppli said it believed the G1 was well above the industry average in terms of ease of use but still had a gap to close with the iPhone ’s user interface .
It also observed that the phone ’s industrial design and finish lacked the “ wow factor ” of slicker competitors .
“ The G1’s ... major advantage is its integration with Google Internet services and its capability to accommodate the flood of free applications that are becoming available , ” iSuppli ’s senior wireless communications analyst Tina Teng said in a statement .
The Road Ahead
Like a metronome of the modern world , for over 50 years Gordon ’s prediction has set the pace for innovation and development .
This foresight laid a fertile foundation from which all modern technology could spring , including the broad rise of digitization and personal electronics .
Moving forward , Moore ’s Law and related innovations are shifting toward the seamless integration of computing within our daily lives .
This vision of an endlessly empowered and interconnected future brings clear challenges and benefits .
Privacy and evolving security threats are persistent and growing concerns .
But the benefits of ever smarter , ubiquitous computing technology , learning to anticipate our needs , can help keep us healthier , safer , and more productive in the long run .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. regulators should examine whether a controversial class of chemicals found in many plastic products including children ’s toys can hurt people , a panel of experts said on Thursday .
Shoppers Claudia Villagomez ( L ) and her daughter Amanda , 14 , stock up on toys at a Target store in Chicago November 23 , 2007 .

A panel of the independent National Research Council said the scientific evidence justifies an Environmental Protection Agency assessment of the health effects from cumulative exposure to chemicals known as phthalates .
Phthalates , which make plastic products soft and flexible , have been used commercially for decades .
They are different from another chemical , bisphenol A , or BPA , found in plastic products including baby bottles that has also come under health scrutiny .
The Food and Drug Administration says BPA is safe at current levels of exposure but plans more research .
Animal studies cited by the panel indicated that exposure to phthalates affected male reproductive system development .
Some phthalates reduce levels of the male hormone testosterone .
Studies also link phthalates to liver cancer , the panel said .
If the EPA does an assessment , it could lead to new regulations on products with phthalates , the panel said .
“ If we do n’t do this as a cumulative risk assessment focused on these adverse effects , we ’re going to be underestimating risks , ” said panel chairwoman , Deborah Cory - Slechta of the University of Rochester .
Phthalates have been used in toys , cosmetics , personal - care products , food packaging , pharmaceuticals , medical devices , and cleaning and building materials .
They have been found in products such as teethers and pacifiers that babies put in their mouths .
President George W. Bush signed a law this year banning three types of phthalates in children ’s toys and child care items , except for minute amounts , while temporarily banning three others pending further study .
The same six phthalates have been banned in European toys for nearly a decade .
Chris Bryant of the American Chemistry Council , an industry group , expressed concern about the panel ’s recommendations , saying Congress had already asked the Consumer Product Safety Commission to conduct a risk assessment on phthalates .
Bryant said the panel ’s proposal for such a broad EPA risk assessment “ essentially could result in a study without limits , financially or otherwise . ”
Some retailers including Wal - Mart and Toys R
Us have announced plans to phase out phthalates in toys .
Senator John McCain ’s campaign manager was paid more than $ 30,000 a month for five years as president of an advocacy group set up by the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to defend them against stricter regulations , current and former officials say .
Mr. McCain , the Republican candidate for president , has recently begun campaigning as a critic of the two companies and the lobbying army that helped them evade greater regulation as they began buying riskier mortgages with implicit federal backing .
He and his Democratic rival , Senator Barack Obama , have donors and advisers who are tied to the companies .
But last week the McCain campaign stepped up a running battle of guilt by association when it began broadcasting commercials trying to link Mr. Obama directly to the government bailout of the mortgage giants this month by charging that he takes advice from Fannie Mae ’s former chief executive , Franklin Raines , an assertion both Mr. Raines and the Obama campaign dispute .
Incensed by the advertisements , several current and former executives of the companies came forward to discuss the role that Rick Davis , Mr. McCain ’s campaign manager and longtime adviser , played in helping Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac beat back regulatory challenges when he served as president of their advocacy group , the Homeownership Alliance , formed in the summer of 2000 .
Some who came forward were Democrats , but Republicans , speaking on the condition of anonymity , confirmed their descriptions .
Somalia : Somali students establish nonprofit organization
Somali students have set up new organization for the students of Somalia to push for the education of the war racked horn of Africa nation .
Hundreds of students and lecturers participated a huge ceremony they held in Mogadishu to inaugurate the organization called ( Somalia Students Union ) to illustrate the mechanism of the organization .
One of the Somalia ’s well known Professors Ahmed Abdi Dhi’isow who attended the ceremony has delivered speech at the ceremony and he prolonged to talk on the education situation of Somalia saying that this is the most complicated time that Somali students experienced .
He congratulated the students for their efforts regarding the establishing of that organization .
He further said that it was welcomable to install like this organization at this transitional period .
He lastly vowed the students for outside scholarship and he asked them to be on the look out of their future plus knowing the significance of the country ’s educational style reinstallation .
The chairman of the organization Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamud has noted that the object they launched the organization was how to push forward the scrawny students facing the deadly violence in the country .
A difficult works is ahead of this new organization to renovate the education of the capital Mogadishu that has been partially destroyed when the Ethiopian backed Somali government came into the capital as some education centres turned into military grounds as well them to make an effort how they would persuade the government to pull its troops out from the educational areas in Mogadishu .

In talks with Emanuel , Pelosi has “ set parameters ” for what she wants from Obama and his staff .
Pelosi lays down the law with Rahm
In a recent conversation with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Rahm Emanuel offered some advice on a Democratic House leadership race .
Pelosi ’s response , according to several Democratic sources :
It is “ an internal House Democratic Caucus matter , and we ’ll handle it . ”
Democratic insiders say there ’s no animosity between Pelosi and Emanuel , who ’s leaving his post as chairman of the House Democratic Caucus to become the next White House chief of staff .

But the speaker is laying down the law nonetheless .
In talks with Emanuel and others , sources say , Pelosi has “ set parameters ” for what she wants from Barack Obama and his White House staff — no surprises , and no backdoor efforts to go around her and other Democratic leaders by cutting deals with moderate New Democrats or conservative Blue Dogs .
Specifically , Pelosi has told Emanuel that she wants to know when representatives of the incoming administration have any contact with her rank - and - file Democrats — and why , sources say .
During the Bush years , the White House set policy , and Republicans on Capitol Hill were expected to follow it .
Former Speaker Dennis Hastert ( R - Ill . ) occasionally lashed out at former White House chief of staff Andy Card or other senior administration aides when he felt they had gone too far .
But in general , Republican lawmakers followed Bush ’s lead on every major legislative battle , from Iraq to tax and spending bills to anti-terror policies .
With the exception of immigration reform , the House fight over the $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout package and last week ’s meltdown over a bailout for the Big Three automakers , Bush got what he wanted from Congress , especially within his own party .
Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) are signaling that they wo n’t tolerate a repeat with a Democrat in the White House and Democratic majorities in the House and the Senate .
Pelosi “ is not going to allow Obama to triangulate her , ” said a Democratic source close to the leadership .
“ It ’s not going to happen to her . ”
Pelosi ’s mantra , in a way , is “ no surprises . ”
The speaker wants to be told when Reid is communicating with the Blue Dogs or other factions with her caucus , and she expects the same from Obama when he arrives in the Oval Office , said Democratic sources .
“ We certainly are in frequent communication with the [ Obama ] transition team , ” said Brendan Daly , Pelosi ’s communications director .
Daly noted that Pelosi and Emanuel have long - standing ties — she appointed him to head up the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee at the start of 2005 — and added that Emanuel often speaks directly with John Lawrence , Pelosi ’s chief of staff .
Daly said Pelosi will work closely with Obama and Reid to craft an economic stimulus package early next year , as well as other economic recovery legislation .
“ She and President - elect Obama have the same goals , ” Daly added .
“ It ’s a matter of working together to get things done . ”
Pelosi herself said the same about Obama in an interview with Bloomberg ’s Al Hunt last week , stating that “ our priorities are the same about creating good - paying jobs . ”
But it wo n’t always be that easy .
Capitol
Hill veterans predict that , no matter how much goodwill there is at the start of a new administration , there are always battles over policy and legislative priorities between the White House and Congress .
“ There is tension .
There is going to be tension , ” said a Democratic veteran of Capitol Hill .
“ This is not Hastert .
She wants to know what they are up to . ”
The Emanuel - Pelosi relationship is a complex one that defies easy explanation .
Emanuel was a rising star inside the Democratic Caucus — with many members convinced he would be speaker one day — until Obama tapped him for the West Wing job .
In large part , Emanuel owed his rise to Pelosi , who put him in charge of the DCCC , where he helped lead the Democrats back to the House majority after 12 years out of power .
From the DCCC , Emanuel moved up to the chairmanship of the caucus .
But both he and Pelosi had stocked the DCCC with their own loyalists after the 2006 election , and they both tried to influence campaign strategy as subtly as possible through these surrogates .
At the same time , Emanuel was often jockeying with other members on major legislation , including immigration reform and the Wall Street bailout , but rarely without the speaker ’s blessing .
Pelosi sometimes resisted Emanuel ’s desire to always be on the attack , but she did respect his insight and his willingness to work hard to achieve legislative and political goals .
She refused to back Emanuel when he made noises about running for majority whip , the post now held by Rep. Jim Clyburn ( D - S.C. ) .
But when Obama approached him about the chief of staff job , Emanuel consulted Pelosi first .
Yet the two will find themselves on different ends of Pennsylvania Avenue next year , and that will change the nature of their current relationship profoundly .
“ Look , they have different goals now , ” said an aide to one top Democrat .
“ Her job is to protect her members ; his job is protect Obama .
Those ca n’t always be the same thing . ”
This source added : “ I think they will do what they can to work together , but these are two strong - willed people who are used to getting their way .
There ’s bound to be some areas of disagreement .
We ’ll just have to see how they handle it . ”
“ We are the Shebab of the sea and we ca n’t be scared by the Shebab of the land , ” Mohamed Said said .
“ If anybody attempts to attack , that would be suicide . ”

WASHINGTON 
The heads of the Big Three automakers of Detroit pleaded on Tuesday for emergency government aid to stave off potential collapse , but after four hours of testimony , it appeared they had not persuaded enough lawmakers to move quickly on a bailout .
Senate Democratic leaders said they had not been able to muster the support for legislation that would provide $ 25 billion to the troubled auto industry from the Treasury Department ’s $ 700 billion economic rescue fund .
There is still a possibility that money may be freed up for Detroit from a previously approved loan program to help automakers retool their plants for more fuel - efficient vehicles .
But the industry hardly received a warm reception in Washington , despite its mounting troubles .
The frantic bid from Detroit for help was laid bare at a packed hearing of the Senate banking committee , in which two of the three automakers said they might run out of money by the end of the year .

I ’ve always wondered how basketball announcers manage to stay focused with half - naked dancers prancing around .
Turns out announcers are human too and are n’t always able to keep a straight face .
During a recent Denver Nuggets game , the announcer was left speechless by a pair of sexy boobies bouncing up and down in front of the camera .
There ’s a long pause by the announcer before he manages to catch his breath and musters .
“ A festive atmosphere here at the Pepsi center . ”
You can literally hear the announcer panting .
In case you ’re wondering , that dancer ’s name is Bridget .
Here ’s a pic to boot .

Lois K Feldman , 38 of Carroll Iowa , broke her silence today , about that incident , saying that having sex in the disabled toilets at the Metrodome at a football game ruined her life and that she was so drunk on wine she did n’t remember hooking up with Ross Walsh .
Feldman , a married mother of three , told the newspaper that she was fired Wednesday from an assisted living center , where she had been an administrator .
“ I do n’t know what happened , ” Feldman told the paper .
“ But I do n’t deny that it did happen , because , obviously , there are police reports . ”
Obviously .
That ’s how we all tell conclusively what went on the night before .
Feldman went on to say that said she had never met Walsh .
We are sure what she meant to say was she had never met Ross Walsh before having sex with him in the toilets and being cheered on by a crowd of football fans .
No word from Walsh or his girlfriend .
But surely the bragging rights of nailing an older , drunk off her ass woman goes down significantly when she can’t even remember the sex .
Classy !
UPDATE ROSS WALSH PHOTO
Check out the other half of story .
Ross Walsh has made his Myspace Page public
Having now seen both photographs we can conclude that Mr Walsh was playing significantly above his division .
A reader chimes in :
I just want to ask : can anyone , anyone , imagine Condoleeza Rice or Margaret Thatcher or even Hillary Clinton for God 's sake , winking at the nation and / or being coquettish in any national format ?
Yeah .
Just checking .
The damage John McCain 's baldfaced sexism and Sarah Palin 's cocktail waitress act have done to American feminism has yet to be fully assessed .
Palin has actually forced me to realize that , however much I despise Hillary Clinton , I have never doubted her professionalism and capacity to fight and win on her own terms in a male - dominated world by meeting and exceeding the standards of any male counterpart .
( It was not her fault she ran against the political genius of his generation . )
I cannot even imagine her winking and flirting on stage , although the New Hampshire tears were a bit of a stunt .
Thatcher remains the standard .
She was not above using feminine wiles in charming individuals ; but in public , in debate , in the Commons , she beat men at their own game , using nothing but knowledge , forensics , expertise , argument and courage .
From Thatcher to Palin is not a slide downwards for conservative women .
It 's a free - fall .
And McCain did it .

CAMBRIDGE , Mass. , Nov. 20 , 2008 -- Quantum computers would likely outperform conventional computers in simulating chemical reactions involving more than four atoms , according to scientists at Harvard University , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and Haverford College .
Such improved ability to model and predict complex chemical reactions could revolutionize drug design and materials science , among other fields .
Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the researchers describe " software " that could simulate chemical reactions on quantum computers , an ultra-modern technology that relies on quantum mechanical phenomena , such as entanglement , interference , and superposition .
Quantum computing has been heralded for its potential to solve certain types of problems that are impossible for conventional computers to crack .
" There is a fundamental problem with simulating quantum systems -- such as chemical reactions -- on conventional computers , " says Alán Aspuru - Guzik , assistant professor of chemistry and chemical biology in Harvard 's Faculty of Arts and Sciences .
" As the size of a system grows , the computational resources required to simulate it grow exponentially .
For example , it might take one day to simulate a reaction involving 10 atoms , two days for 11 atoms , four days for 12 atoms , eight days for 13 atoms , and so on .
Before long , this would exhaust the world 's computational power . "
Unlike a conventional computer , Aspuru - Guzik and his colleagues say , a quantum computer could complete the steps necessary to simulate a chemical reaction in a time that does n't increase exponentially with the reaction 's complexity .
" Being able to predict the outcomes of chemical reactions would have tremendous practical applications , " says Ivan Kassal , a graduate student in chemical physics at Harvard .
" A lot of research in drug design , materials science , catalysis , and molecular biology is still done by trial and error .
Having accurate predictions would change the way these types of science are done . "
The researchers demonstrate in PNAS that quantum computers would need to attain a size of about 100 qubits -- which are to quantum computers as bits are to conventional computers -- to outperform current classical supercomputers at a chemical simulation .
" This is still far beyond current prototype quantum computers , " Kassal says .
" And although it might take millions of quantum elementary operations on a few hundred quantum bits , our work suggests that with quantum computers that are as fast as modern conventional computers , one could simulate in seconds a chemical reaction that would take a conventional computer years . "
Rather than using binary bits labeled as " zero " and " one " to encode data , as in a conventional computer , quantum computing stores information in qubits , which can represent both " zero " and " one " simultaneously .
When a quantum computer is put to work on a problem , it considers all possible answers by simultaneously arranging its qubits into every combination of " zeroes " and " ones . "
Since one sequence of qubits can represent many different numbers , a quantum computer would make far fewer computations than a conventional one in solving some problems .
After the computer 's work is done , a measurement of its qubits provides the answer .

Aspuru - Guzik and Kassal 's co-authors on the PNAS paper are Stephen P. Jordan of MIT , Peter J. Love of Haverford College , and Masoud Mohseni of Harvard .

Police lose memory stick with top secret ' terrorist ' information
West Midlands police are investigating the loss of a computer memory stick containing information on terror suspects ( file picture )
A computer memory stick said to contain top - secret information on terror suspects has been lost by police , it has been reported .
The black 4GB stick went missing after being taken out of a police station by an officer on patrol in the West Midlands last Thursday .
Officers have raided at least one property in the hunt for the device .
Officials spent the weekend co-ordinating efforts to find it and it is understood that Home Secretary Jacqui Smith has already been informed .
West Midlands
Police said it could not comment on the contents of the device , but local media reports suggested it held ' top - secret information on terror suspects ' .
A force spokeswoman said : ' We can confirm West Midlands Police is investigating the loss of a data memory stick .
' We are conducting searches in an attempt to recover the lost item .
We will not comment in relation to the contents of that memory stick .
The Birmingham Mail today reported that the black 4GB stick was lost after being taken out of a police station in Castle Vale , Birmingham , by an officer on patrol last week .
The memory stick reportedly contains details of terror cells being tracked by police , although the force refused to confirm or deny this .
A Home Office spokesman said the Government had been informed about the loss but added that he could not comment further .
It 's a bleak time for the financial markets .
We 've seen financial institutions fall and governments around the world struggling to stabilise the markets .
But who is to blame ?
According to media reports there are two suspects in the dock : the " rocket scientists " ( a.k.a. the financial mathematicians ) who provided the information behind the market 's decisions , or the greedy bankers who only thought about quick profits and their end - of - year bonuses .
First on the stand : mathematics .
But just what role does maths have in the financial market ?
Will maths give you the mortage ?
Listen to a podcast of this interview .
Most of us will have come into direct contact with financial maths when applying for a loan from a high street bank .
Rather than the bank manager relying on how well they know you personally , as might have happened in the past , now loan decisions are based on statistical models .
" Based on retrospective data about past customers ( data from their application forms and how they 've behaved in the past ) we can build statistical models to predict whether someone is likely to have difficulty repaying , or even default on their loan , " said David Hand , director of the Quantitative Financial Risk Management Centre at Imperial College .
This has the advantage of limiting the role of subjective personal assessments in the decision , and also that , as these models are improved over time , bank managers benefit from the experience of all past customers rather than just those they have personally been involved with .
But these robust mathematical models predicting whether or not someone will be able to repay their loan did not avert the subprime mortgages in the US ( high - risk loans such as mortgages for 100 % of a property 's value , or to people likely to default ) , the first domino to fall in the current crisis .
" In the area I work in , the retail banking sector , the models are pretty good at predicting if someone is a high risk or not .
But predicting that someone is a high risk does n't stop somebody nevertheless going ahead and taking a bet on that person , " said Hand .
" So we 've got to distinguish between the models , and how the models are used . "
With the financial crisis now unfolding , much blame has also been put on derivatives , one of the complex financial instruments traded in the international markets .
Derivatives , often seen by the press as the bogey - man of finance , are financial products that are based on the value of underlying variables .
These figures could be anything from the price of a share to the number of particularly cold winter days .
( You can read more about derivatives in the Plus article Rogue Trading . )
Financial mathematicians build models to understand how these derivatives perform , which contributes to how they are priced .
The idea behind a derivative is that you can reduce the risk associated with an asset , for example hedging an investment by buying a derivative that will gain if your original investment loses .
Say you have to pay € 1000 for your new sofa when it is delivered in three months time .
This seems a fair price today , when €1000 is equal to £ 770 .
But if the price of the Euro goes up , and in three months time € 1000 is worth £ 850 , then that 's £ 80 more than you were expecting to pay .
To protect against this you could buy a call option on the Euro ( the option costing you , say , £ 10 ) , giving you the right ( but not the obligation ) to buy € 1000 in three months time at £ 770 .
If your worst fears are realised and the Euro goes up so that € 1000 is worth £ 850 , you could exercise your option and buy € 1000 at the agreed price of £ 770 , saving you £ 70 ( £ 80 due to the rise in the Euro minus the £ 10 the cost of the call option ) .
If however the Euro holds steady or even falls and you decide not to use the call option — you might have lost the £ 10 the option cost you , but benefited from the peace of mind !
Making money off money
You can also invest in derivatives in their own right .
If you bought the call option in the example above as an investment , you are in effect betting that the Euro will rise , and in this case you would make a £ 70 profit .
This can be a wise way to invest , but only if you choose certain types of derivatives .
" I think there needs to be a distinction between the use of derivatives in equity or foreign exchange , where there is a very liquid asset underlying the trade , and the use of derivatives in the credit arena , " said Chris Rogers , Professor of Statistical Science and head of the Quantitative Finance Group at the University of Cambridge .
" If you buy a call option on a Euro , there is a lot you can do to protect yourself , reacting as the price of a Euro changes .
In a credit default swap ( a sort of insurance against someone defaulting on payments , see below for an example ) , you either pay out nothing , or something .
There is n't a lot you can do to protect yourself against that zero or one event , whereas a derivative in something more continuous in value such as the Euro can be hedged .
A credit related derivative is basically an insurance product . "
You might buy a credit derivative if you have loaned Company A an amount d=£ 1000 for 3 years , but you are worried that they might not pay it back .
You could buy a credit derivative from Company B to insure against this possibility .
You would pay Company B an amount of , say , p=£ 30 ( split into say £ 10 per year — like an insurance premium ) , and if at the end of 3 years Company A does n't pay back your money , Company B will give you your £ 1000 instead .
Company B either has to pay out , or it does n't , and their profit from the credit derivative would be
Profit = ( probability of not defaulting ) × p − ( probability of defaulting ) × d .
Therefore as long as the probability of defaulting was sufficiently low , Company B would make money .
And this is why credit derivatives became so popular : for the buyers it was an insurance policy against people defaulting on loans , and for sellers it appeared to be an easy profit while the market was booming and not many loans were defaulting .
In reality credit derivatives were used to bundle up a large basket of loans , sharing the credit risk associated with these debts around the market .
These financial products gave good returns while there were only a few failing loans in the basket .
But as the credit derivative market grew , subprime loans began to be included in credit derivatives , and when large numbers of people defaulted on these loans the effects were felt throughout the market .
So did the mathematicians get their sums wrong ?
Not really , said Rogers , the information the mathematicians could provide could only be as good as the data their models were built on .
" The modelling assumption [ used to price these derivatives ] did n't allow a sufficiently high probability of large numbers of loans failing at once , and that is what happened . "
Listen to a podcast of this interview .
For a new market such as credit derivatives the data available would n't have been very good and that would affect the models .
" The price for a new product is whatever anyone is prepared to pay , " said Rogers , and the price of credit derivatives did n't reflect the true risks they involved .
Even if mathematicians did highlight the risks involved in these products , it is likely that in a booming market they would probably have been over - ruled in the face of potential profits .
" The role of mathematicians in a bank is essentially a subordinate one , they are the servants of the business imperative . "
Rogers said there is evidence that some people correctly assessed the risks the market was taking : " Goldman Sachs for example were much more cautious about the risks involved with subprime mortgages , and events proved them right , even though they too have suffered in the fallout . "
Greed made me do it ... or was it the hormones ?
What about the other accused , the greedy bankers ?
According to Geraint Anderson , a city - banker turned writer , many did operate with only their bonuses in mind .
But perhaps it is the environment the bankers work in that is the problem .
Their rewards depend on how much they make in the short - term , and this is part of the regulatory changes that may take place as a result of this crisis .
But regulation might not be able to change human behaviour .
John Coates , a Research Fellow in Neuroscience and Finance at the University of Cambridge , worked as a trader during Black Monday , the Asian Financial Crisis and the Dot.com Bubble and noticed strange behaviour during periods of financial crisis : " During the Dot.com Bubble in New York people were acting very odd , they were displaying classic symptoms of mania - overconfidence , racing thoughts , diminished need for sleep .
They were n't acting like that before the bubble and they were n't acting like that after , so it occurred to me that some chemical was altering their behaviour during the bubble .
I also noticed that women seemed relatively unaffected by the frenzy .
Both facts put me onto the trail of a chemical like testosterone . "
His research now looks at a model called the Winner Effect , which has been tested in a number of animal species .
The winner of a competition comes out with boosted testosterone levels which in the short term give them advantages in the next competition , such as increased confidence and risk taking .
But after a series of wins the build up of testosterone eventually causes them to become overconfident and take stupid and ultimately dangerous risks .
Coates tested the hormone levels in bankers over two weeks on a trading floor and found that they had extremely high peaks of testosterone that closely correlated with successful trading days .
He thinks that high testosterone levels , and the increased risk - taking that ensues , might contribute to instability in the market .
But people can't change their physiology , so what is the answer ?
Coates suggests that changing the steroid profile of the trading floor would make a difference , which means increasing the proportion of women and older men to the more typical inhabitants , younger men .
It is of course too simplistic to lay the blame on either the maths or the bankers .
As the current crisis unfolds we are getting a crash course in how the markets work , and how that environment , and even our own behaviour , may have contributed to the situation .
We can only hope that we also learn the lessons in what went wrong , and do something to prevent it happening again .

Autism And Schizophrenia Share Common Origin Says Researcher
Schizophrenia and autism probably share a common origin , according to Dutch researcher Annemie Ploeger following an extensive literature study .
The developmental psychologist says that both mental diseases have similar physical abnormalities which are formed during the first month of pregnancy .
Developmental psychologist Ploeger has investigated whether there is a connection between disorders in the first month of pregnancy and the development of schizophrenia and autism .
Interestingly , many physical abnormalities of autistics are also prevalent in schizophrenics .
For example , both autistics and schizophrenics sometimes have protruding ears and peculiar toes .
There are also differences : a large head and intestinal problems , for example , are typical traits occurring in autistics .
From this , Ploeger concluded that the two disorders share a common origin .
The same error that occurs very early in pregnancy develops into autism in one individual and schizophrenia in another .
Early vulnerability
Ploeger 's research concludes that in the period between 20 and 40 days after fertilisation , the embryo is highly susceptible to disruptions .
In this period , early organogenesis , there is a lot of interaction between the different parts of the body .
If something goes wrong with a given part of the body , it greatly influences the development of other parts of the body .
As people with schizophrenia and autism frequently have physical abnormalities to body parts formed during early organogenesis , Ploeger concluded that the foundation for these psychiatric disorders is laid very early during pregnancy .
The existence of a relationship between unhealthy behavior during pregnancy and the subsequent development of schizophrenia and autism in the child was already known .
However , Ploeger 's hypothesis that the early organogenesis stage is the most critical , is new .
Ploeger bases her hypothesis on an extensive study of scientific literature in this area .
She often had to make use of related studies ; although a lot of research has been done into prenatal influences on the development of schizophrenia and autism , little is known about the influence that the period between 20 to 40 days after fertilisation has .
Toxic pregnancy medicine ?
For example , she acquired information about autism from a study into softenon use .
Softenon is a drug against morning sickness that was administered to women in the 1960s and 1970s .
Later it was discovered that severely disabled children were born as a result of this medicine .
Autistic children were born in four percent of pregnancies in which softenon was used , whereas normally this figure is 0.1 percent .
Women could state exactly when they started to take softenon .
The women who had taken softenon between the 20th and 24th day of the pregnancy had the greatest chance of giving birth to an autistic child .
Ploeger advises women to stop risky behaviour such as smoking , medicine use and stressful activities before they even become pregnant .
If you only start to live healthily once you know that you are pregnant , the basis for a disrupted development of your child could already have been laid .
Ploeger 's research was partly financed by NWO is within the research program Evolution and Behaviour .
Warning : Complicated
Tax calcuations follow .
I promise a treat after .
I hate putting tables in dkos because they 're a royal pia to format :
Reprinted
tax tables from the IRS for 2007 - Married Filing Jointly
$ 0-$ 15,650 10 %
$ 15,650.01 - $ 63,700 $ 1,565.00 + 15 % over 15.650
$ 63,700.01-128,500 $ 8,772.50 + 25 % over 63,700
$ 128,500.01 - $ 195,850 $ 24,972.50 + 28 % over 128,500
$ 195,850.01 - $ 349,700 $ 43,830.50 + 33 % over 195,850
$ 349,700.01 and up $ 94,601.00 + 35 % over 349,700
Here 's the Math
Family of 4 earning $ 70,000 * Under our Current System
Annual Health Premiums = $ 14,122 shared costs between employee and company ( 2 standard family insurance plans are listed below )
* The $ 5,480 is deducted in pre-tax dollars for most employer plans .
If the $ 5,480 is paid with pre-tax dollars , then the Family of 4 that grosses $ 70,000 actually pays taxes on $ 70,000 - $ 5,480 and taxable income is reduced to $ 64,520 .
The taxes are then calculated accordingly .
( All the MSM and tax experts do n't account for this factoid , which favors McCain 's rhetoric . )
Using the tax table above with adjusted earnings of $ 64,520
Current Tax bill = $ 8,772.50 + $ 205 = $ 8,977.50
Employer Ins : Company pays $ 8,632 +
Employee pays $ 5,480 * = $ 14,112 annual ins pymts ( not taxed )
Family pays : Tax bill $ 8,977.50 + Emp. Ins. premiums $ 5,480 = $ 14,457.50
* If the $ 5,480 is deducted from after - tax dollars ( the employer contributions are still not taxable ) .
Then the Family of 4 really does earn $ 70,000 and the tax bill goes to : $ 8,772.50 + $ 1,575 = $ 10,347.50
Tax bill $ 10,347.50 + Emp. Ins. premiums $ 5,480 = $ 15,827.50
Note :
Under the current system ; there are some employers that make employee contributions subject to federal withholding , but the employer contributions are not taxable .
Enter McCain
McCain Family of 4 earning $ 70,000 *
* McCain taxes health insurance premiums , so both the employer and employee contributions are subject to federal withholding .
This family may think they earn $ 70,000 , but under McCain they actually earn $ 78,632 ( their gross plus employer contributions for health insurance premiums ) .
McCain Annual Health Premiums = $ 14,122 shared costs between employee and company
McCain Employer Ins : Company pays $ 8,632 +
Employee pays $ 5,480 = $ 14,112 annual ins pymts
McCain Family of 4 who used to earn $ 70,000 now earns $ 78,632
Continuing to use the Tax Table above :
McCain ’s Tax bill = $ 8,772.50 + $ 3,733 = $ 12,505.50 - 5,000 ( Tax Credit ) = $ 7,505.50
McCain Family Pays : Tax bill $ 7,505.50 + Ins. premiums $ 14,112 = $ 21,617.50
That would be $ 5,790 - $ 7,160 more than they pay now .
Add another 7.65 % of the employer contribution and the family gets stuck for another : $ 660 for $ 6,450 - $ 7,820 .
UPDATE : Elfling points out quite rightly , that the employer contribution will then be subject to the 7.65 % payroll tax .
I 'm going to leave these tax calculations alone , but the reality is that the employer is likely to reduce their contributions by the increased payroll taxes .
The only thing this family can do is find cheaper insurance that covers less with higher deductibles and co-pays .
Only now , the family has to bow out of their employer 's insurance program and they have to forfeit the employer contributions ( because we all know the employer is n't going to give you a raise if you do n't take their insurance ) .
Ummm , let 's take the family insurance premiums down to $ 11,500 per year
Still using the Tax Table above :
McCain ’s Tax bill = $ 8,772.50 + $ 1,575 = $ 10,347.50 - 5,000 ( Tax Credit ) = $ 5,347.50
McCain Family pays : Tax bill $ 5,347.50 + Ins. premiums $ 11,500 = $ 16,847.50
Ok , that 's better .
That would be only $ 1,020 - $ 2,390 more than they pay now .
Add another 7.65 % of the employer contribution and the family gets stuck for another : $ 660 for $ 1,680 - $ 3,050 .
Add the loss of the employer 's contributions of $ 8,632 or $ 8,632 - 660 = $ 7,872 and if you 're like me , you 're not sure which way to go with that $ 8,632 or $ 7,872 other than to shuck this claptrap and vote for Obama .
Sooooo , we not only have a new definition of " budget neutral " , we also have this family with less effective health insurance that covers less services with higher deductibles and higher co-pays and a loss of their employer 's contributions of $ 8,632 .
I do n't see this as an advantage .
McCain really must think we are stupid .
People will drop their coverage altogether with a plan like this .
... and the lady at the WSJ is full of crap when she said :
Sen. McCain 's plan actually would lower taxes for most people .
But that means the plan would n't pay for itself , because it cuts certain taxes more than it raises others .
it seems to be the other way around to me .
... but you can tell her that yourself

Going 3 Steps Forward With Obama :
Last year I wrote a critical diary directed at Barak Obama 's health care proposal .
Back then he had the plan 's basics .
Today , I have to say Obama has moved 3 Steps Forward with his plan and it's far better and more detailed than what I wrote about in May of 2007 .
What I really like is that Obama has answered his critics questions and is n't afraid to commit to paper the real plan .
Although his vision is n't perfect , he 's continuing to go forward with a plan that is far better than what we have now .
My original post in May of 2007 Obama : Health Insurance is NOT Health CARE !!!
covered what to me were serious gaps , flaws and a scary lack of detail in Obama 's health plan .
I was n't convinced back then .
Today , all of my issues are directly addressed in one place or another on Obama 's campaign site .
http://www.barackobama.com/...
http://www.barackobama.com/...
http://www.barackobama.com/...
I 'm not going to write about Obama 's plans , because his campaign site does a pretty good job of it and he owns up to the costs of it :
Q. How will we pay for the Obama plan ?
A . The Obama plan will realize tremendous savings within the health care system to help finance the plan .
The additional revenue needed to fund the up - front investments in technology and to help people who cannot afford health insurance is more than covered by allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire for people making more than $ 250,000 per year , as they are scheduled to do

... and since you 've been so patient with me , here 's Jeff Dunham and Peanut goes to Washington .
( The last 5 seconds is how I think of McCain these days . )
and a Peanut blooper reel
In a radio interview in 2001 , then - Illinois State Sen. Barack Obama noted -- somewhat ruefully -- that the same Supreme Court that ordered political and educational equality in the 1960s and 1970s did not bring about economic equality as well .
Although Mr. Obama said he could come up with arguments for the constitutionality of such action , the plain meaning of the Constitution quite obviously prohibits it .
Mr. Obama is hardly alone in his expansive view of legitimate government .
During the past month , Sen. John McCain ( who , ...
AT FIRST glance , there was n’t much to the way Sens.
Barack Obama and John McCain dressed for the debate Tuesday in Nashville , other than their partisan choices in necktie color -- a pale shade of blue for Obama and red stripes for McCain .
Both wore two - button , notch - lapel jackets with a single vent in the back ( Obama ’s was black , McCain ’s was dark charcoal ) .
Both wore white dress shirts with a spread collar .
But like a “ magic eye ” painting , the longer you looked , the clearer the picture became , and as the candidates paced the red - carpet ring , their divergent styles popped into view .
What emerged ?
Obama wore his suit , and McCain ’s suit wore him .
Tall and lanky , the Democratic nominee came off as confident and at ease in his custom - tailored ensemble , which showed just the right amount of shirt cuff , the dimple in his necktie just off center .
His Republican counterpart looked uncomfortable -- every inch a career military man for whom the dress uniform seemed a necessary evil , but combat fatigues are an easy fit .
When the situation is less formal , McCain carries the day .
His April stroll through a Baghdad market in a blue shirt and bullet - proof vest had near John Wayne swagger , while Obama on a bike ride in a polo shirt and a pair of high - waisted dad jeans came off like Urkel from “ Family Matters . ”
That ’s no small matter when so much political perception centers on how “ approachable ” and “ real ” a candidate seems .
But projecting authority is still the No. 1 task , and that means tailoring matters -- putting McCain at a disadvantage .
Although the McCain camp did not respond to confirm the fact , the senator ’s suits look off the rack .
Style - wise , they ’re totally off the mark ; the jackets hang too low for his height ( he ’s 5 feet , 7 inches ) , they ’re too wide in the shoulders and the arms are too long .
The armholes are either too big or sit too low , which causes the sides of his jacket to “ bat - wing ” a bit .
And the torture he endured as a prisoner of war left him with a stiffness of carriage that further emphasizes the outsized look .
In sum , the impression is more David Byrne in the Talking Heads ’ movie “ Stop Making Sense ” circa 1984 than White House contender circa 2008 .
It ’s unfathomable to think that the 25 - year veteran of Washington arrives at debates unaware of his appearance -- especially in light of a recent report that he shelled out more than $ 5,000 to a makeup artist to prep him for a TV appearance .
The more likely scenario is that it ’s part of his straight - talking modus operandi to reject any wardrobe wisdom as pure gimcrackery .
Still , he ’s made some small adjustments along the way .
On Tuesday night , he chose a darker suit and swapped out the bold red-and - white tie from the previous debate that conjured images of candy stripers and barber poles .
And that scored points with style experts .
“ It was about the best dressed I ’ve seen [ McCain ] in the debates , ” said Alan Au , vice president of Beverly Hills ’ Jimmy Au’s , a store that specializes in dressing men 5 feet 8 and under .
“ The tie was very sharp and presidential and did n’t steal focus .
The darker suit made it a little harder to see the problem with the armholes . ”
In the details
Obama , a twice - crowned cover god of Men ’s Vogue , has a different style approach .
He ’s clearly aware of the effect of every last detail .
( It was n’t always this way ; early in his campaign , Obama occasionally appeared with shirt collars far too big for his neck -- which emphasized his comparative youth ) .
The junior senator from Illinois ( who stands 6 feet , 1 1/2 inches ) favors custom - tailored suits from 121 - year - old Chicago clothier Hart Schaffner Marx ( we ’ll spare you his jacket size and inseam ) .
Perhaps that ’s because there ’s political capital in sporting a suit made by union labor in Des Plaines , Ill. , a fact company representative Lisa Wells helpfully noted .
Wells was unsure whether the black suit Obama wore during Tuesday ’s debate was one of theirs , but it ’s a pretty safe bet .
Obama wore one of the label ’s made - to - measure suits ( two - button , navy blue , 100 % worsted wool , with pleated and cuffed trousers ) when he accepted the Democratic nomination , donned another style for the first presidential debate Sept. 26 , and , Wells says , has five more on order .
He favors an updated take on the traditional suit -- it hangs shorter and has narrower lapels , and it works .
The slim - fitting suits drape effortlessly over his frame .
At times , however , being so well put together works against Obama .
At rallies , where the candidates have been known to shuck their jackets and roll up their sleeves , McCain looks as if he ’s ready to frame a house , while Obama looks like an accountant baffled by casual Friday .
“ It ’s kind of a cliché look , ” said Details magazine ’s fashion director , Michael Macko .
“ You take off the coat and roll up the sleeves -- ‘ Look , I ’m a real guy . ’
He might do better to wear a pair of gray pants and a navy blazer in a more casual setting .
Or , he ’s been known to wear a tan suit , which is a big fashion step for a politician .
If he did that and then took his jacket off , he ’d look like he was wearing khakis , which would seem more casual without looking forced . ”
The verdict : Obama seems to have gotten better marks from the fashion press overall , but both candidates would be wise in the final days of the campaign to remember they are n’t just playing to the base .

A new report has found that nearly one in seven teenage boys think it is OK to make a girl have sex with them , if she has been flirting with them .
The study into the impact of violence on young people has prompted calls for violence prevention programs in schools .
The report called An Assault on our Future was commissioned by the White Ribbon Foundation , a body that campaigns on the issue of violence against women .
The report 's co-author , Dr Michael Flood , says among the most worrying findings was that one in three young people had witnessed their fathers being violent towards their mothers .
" What was also significant was that large numbers particularly of girls and young women were being subjected to sexual violence of unwanted sex in their own relationships , " he said .
" So for example let 's see nearly one in seven boys think it 's OK to make a girl have sex with you if she 's flirting . "
White Ribbon Foundation executive director Isabel McCrea said the research also exposed the tendency of experiences with violence to polarise children 's opinion of domestic abuse .
" The attitudes that I have described that show that boys and young men , a significant proportion of them have violence supporting attitudes cut across the board , " she said .
" But we do know that if you come from a violent home then there are two pathways that you can take .
One is that you then think that violence is OK and are more likely to use that later in life .
" But we also know that some boys who come from violent homes then really go on to abhor violence and to be very much against it .
" So there is something happening there in terms of people 's ability to deal with it in different ways . "
Early intervention
Ms McCrea says this split highlights the need for schools to provide teens with examples of acceptable behaviour .
" I think one of the things that we are most concerned about is that for people who are experiencing violence in the home , it is very important that in some other aspect of their life , they can see a different way of behaving , and they can see some hope and some examples of what respectful relationships look like , " she said .
" That is why it is so terribly important that every school is able to run programs that show teenagers the way that they can behave to be happier and to have better relationships and that is what we are calling for . "
Dr Flood agrees , saying more Government - funded violence prevention programs are urgently needed to tackle the issue , and should be introduced into schools and universities .
Ms McCrea says the research also shows for children , witnessing domestic violence is as damaging as being the direct target of it .
" In homes where , for example , the male carer is being violent to the mother and the children are aware of that and witness that , it is as damaging as if the children were being directly hit themselves in terms of the impacts on their mental health , " she said .
" Well , we are looking at children who have come from violent homes , being less able to perform well at school , being less able to form useful and happy relationships , experiencing higher levels of depression , alcohol and drug abuse later in life , " she said .
" All these things are much more risky for children from violent homes .
Of course , they are not inevitable . "
- Editor 's note :
This story was amended on December 3 , 2008 to acknowledge an error made by the authors of the White Ribbon Foundation report .
The original story reported , in part , that " one in every three boys believe it is not a big deal to hit a girl " .
In fact , the author of the report , Dr Michael Flood , has advised the ABC that this finding was in fact wrong .
Dr Flood 's team transposed information in compilation of that part of the report .
The original report by the National Crime Prevention 2001 study upon which much of the White Ribbon report was is based made no reference to " boys hitting girls " and referred only to " girls hitting boys " .
As references to this incorrect information formed a significant part of our online news story , the story has been amended accordingly .

A close video analysis now shows that it was MSNBC staff members who attempted to silence free speech by physically assaulting a group of 9/11 truthers led by Alex Jones during the takeover of a live broadcast at the DNC in Denver .
One staff member , who displayed his credentials to get backstage after assaulting Alex Jones , is even seen on camera using either a knife or a wirecutting tool to severe the cord to Jones ’ bullhorn– clearly demonstrating that his intent was to destroy equipment and that he was not simply caught up in the moment .
( Article continues below )
Members of the primarily pro-Obama crowd also pushed Jones and his crew members and assaulted and smudged their cameras and equipment , with the cooperation and participation of the MSNBC crew– one of whom smudged his own saliva all over an obviously expensive ( and sensitive ) camera lens .
A man in the crowd also flagrantly hit cameraman Richard Reeves , who was quietly filming from a few feet away and gave no pretext for personal attack .
Alex Jones & crew were not deterred , however , and returned some fifteen minutes later with Luke Rudkowski , several members of We Are Change Colorado and two more bullhorns– boldly asserting that any attempt to silence free speech would be met with a literal redoubling of efforts .
9/11 Truth thus challenged the tightly - controlled corporate media by dominating the airwaves with chants of ‘ 9/11 was an inside job , ’ ‘ Investigate 9/11 ′ and other statements for nearly two hours on MSNBC– positions that are never reported on the mainstream media cable channels .

Comment on this article
Why Putting Civil Rights Up to a Vote Is a Bad Idea
Mr. Foster teaches history at DePaul University .
He is the author of Sex and the Eighteenth - Century Man : Massachusetts and the History of Sexuality in America ( 2006 ) and a writer for the History News Service .
The recent decision of California voters to take away the right of gays and lesbians to marry highlights the danger of exposing civil rights protection to popular vote .
Earlier this year , the Supreme Court of California ruled that under the California constitution gays and lesbians had the same right as heterosexuals to be married by the state .
The decision in no way infringed upon the privilege of churches to sanctify marriages as they saw fit .
The issue is of course not limited to California .
In this month 's election , voters in Arizona and Florida decided to deny gays and lesbians the right to marry , with Florida also choosing to deny both heterosexual and homosexual couples the option of civil unions .
In Arkansas , voters decided that gay and lesbian parents should not be allowed to adopt or act as foster parents by restricting those activities to married couples .
Marriage in this country ( as it was even in Puritan New England ) is a civil contract .
Thus , superior courts in California , Massachusetts and Connecticut weighing this right against their states ' constitutions found that its denial violates the civil rights of gays and lesbians .
This is precisely why opponents of gay marriage place the issue on a referendum , in hope that voters will change their constitutions to be more restrictive .
Civil marriage and church marriage are two concepts that should be kept separate .
This separation is at least as old as the U.S. Constitution .
In states that allow gay marriages , as would have been the case in California if Proposition 8 had failed , churches maintain their right to permit or deny their religious ceremonies of marriage .
The Founding Fathers purposefully avoided writing into the Constitution any sanctioning of religion by the state .
They had learned lessons from their own history both in Europe and the American colonies .
Puritan New England founded its colonial enterprise with some official divisions between state and church -- not allowing ministers to hold office , for example .
But the Puritans also cited the Bible to support capital punishment and other laws .
Thus , adultery , then defined as sex between a married woman with either a single or married man ( and not a married man with a single woman ) , was punishable by death .
Today the West criticizes regimes that enforce religious strictures by governmental means , such as , for example , Iran 's death penalty against homosexual sex .
When supporters of defining marriage as between one man and one woman argue that allowing gay and lesbians to marry offends their religious faith , they are invoking a long and troubled entanglement of faith and sexuality in this country .
Because the Bible is frequently invoked in such arguments , presumably the faith invoked is Christianity .
But given this logic the problem quickly arises as to whose faith the law should follow , given that we are an increasingly diverse nation .
Few would argue that the law should derive from Catholicism , for example , with its prohibition on birth control .
Still , does legal birth control not offend a Catholic 's faith ?
Fewer still would argue that the law should be designed to avoid offending those sects of Mormonism that still claim that prohibitions against polygamy violate their faith .
Even fewer would argue that sex altogether be illegal , lest we violate those who identify as Shakers today and embrace celibacy .
California 's legal battles surrounding gay marriage have yet to be settled .
Legal challenges have been initiated in response to the Californians ' recent vote .
Eventually , the U.S. Supreme Court MAY be called upon to rule on the matter .
Still in legal limbo is the status of the 18,000 gays and lesbians who married when California briefly provided that right to them .
In all such cases , spurious arguments about gay and lesbian marriages invoke selective readings of the Bible , faulty interpretations of the Founding Fathers , and lessons not learned from American history or from current religiously intolerant regimes in the world today .
The outcome of the recent referendum in California shows us that unless Americans can recognize that their own individual religious beliefs should not be the basis for the legal and constitutional structure of the country , civil rights should no longer be put to public vote .

On that I wholeheartedly agree !!!
James Lee Winningham - 11/25/2008
I completely agree with you on the complexity of this issue and the need of both sides to consider logical and reasoned arguments .
However , until we as a people start paying attention our debates will always be plagued by soundbites , which prevents any solution .
Paul Zieger - 11/23/2008
This has been a good discussion .
The problem with the way this issue ( and many other " hot button " issues ) is handled presently is that it is argued through media soundbites and raw emotions .
These are thoughtful and complex issues .
If the opposition to same sex marriage relies on religious doctrine to make its point ( and I 'm not saying that they are ) , then they are doomed to failure and rightfully so .
However , this issue is not limited to a religious doctrine .
( You ca n't by rule of law make all people accept Eucharistic Transubstantiaton or Papal Infallibility . )
There are very legitimate arguments against same sex marriage .
They are not automatically falsified or made illegitimate if they are complementary to the beliefs of a certain religious faith .
I think that both sides have to be careful not to paint with too broad a brush .
Faith , informed by reason , has a legitimate place making reasoned arguments in the public square .
I think those who support gay marriage , need to respect this and make their most cogent argument and avoid the Christian bashing .
I think I 've said my peace on this issue .
R.R. Hamilton - 11/23/2008
There is no equal protection argument for same - sex marriage .
In order for there to be one , there would have to be laws that provided that SOME people ( say , whites , women , or straights ) could enter into same - sex marriages but OTHER people ( non-whites , men , gays ) could not .
Laws that ban same - sex marriage ban it for ALL people , not just gays .
Obviously this is not the only " arbitrary restriction " we have on marriage .
Like the others ( banning , for example , brothers from marrying sisters ) , laws against same - sex marriage are applied without discrimination .
People who think anti-same - sex marriage laws are " discriminatory " mistake the government 's interest in marriage .
Government does not give certain blessings to marriages in order to " honor the love " of the union .
If that becomes the rationale for supporting same - sex marriage , then opposition to honoring any other romantic attachments ( like the siblings who want to marry ) becomes nothing more than a REAL act of rank discrimination .
Then there WOULD be an " equal protection " argument to make .
James Lee Winningham - 11/21/2008
Yes , but the people spending the money in this debate are fundamentally against the mere idea that homosexual couples should have that legal committment .
I am not saying you are one of those people since you are making some , though I may not agree wholeheartedly , arguable points .
First off , some would say marriage does not allow a civilization to grow for civilization can grow regardless if there is an institution called marriage .
Though I have the same reservations about " redefining a term , " I can also remember a time when slavery and racism was justified on the basis of " biological realities . "
We proved false those biological realities that said black and white were biologically different .
Now I am not saying that you can prove wrong the biological realities you listed above , for we all know that homosexual couples cannot procreate , but my point is that " biological realities " have been used numerous times in our histories to deny a group or segment of our population civil rights ( or any right for that matter ) , so I do have a problem historically with your argument .
Many people out to defeat this movement are doing so , i believe , because they do n't like the lifestyle and believe it is a sin and that is their right .
However , they are not interested in just stopping the " redefining of marriage , " most of them are against any legal recognition of homosexual unions .
Paul Zieger - 11/20/2008 " Religion " did n't fabricate the traditional marital relationship out of thin air .
Nor did marriage emanate from " religion " to harm people in non-traditional relationships .
The mainstream religions merely reinforce what has obviously been written into creation ( whether by Creator or rising from the primordial ooze ) .
Marriage as man and woman creates the long term bond to allow a family ... a community ... a civilization to grow .
Man and woman together have an obvious procreative power that is absent in same sex couples .
These are biological realities that can not be denied .
The previous instances of " redefining " marriage were to eliminate racism , not to deny biological realities .
If same sex partners want to write up legal contracts defining their relationship , they should feel free to go right ahead .
But to call it a marriage - to deny the biological realities - is an objective fallacy , plain and simple .
Lastly , I would just say that no one is trying to " spite " anyone here .
We all live within the limitations that our natural makeup presents us .
Changing a definition to make some people feel better about themselves is still perpetrating a falsehood .
James Lee Winningham - 11/20/2008
If we are going to determine rights based on a biblical or any religious faith then we have to decide what faith we will adhere to .
Contraception offends the Catholic faith , so lets make contraception in all forms illegal .
Divorce offends the Christian faith , make it illegal along with premarital sex , which is also a sin .
To me , this article is right to suggest that marriage has always been separated between a religious sacrament and a civil contract .
Legally marriage has been redefined at least twice in our history to recognize black on black marriage and black and white marriage , two types of marriages not recognized legally at one point in our history .
Two atheist ( man and woman ) marrying is not a religious ceremony , but it is a civil ceremony illustrating commitment .
Atheism by definition offends the Christian faith , so should two atheist not be able to marry ?
When over 50 percent of heterosexual marriages fail in this country I do not think heterosexuals should be advertising themselves as upholders of the sanctity of marriage .
To me marriage lost its sanctity when reality TV emerged treating marriage as a contest .
How does me denying a person the right to marry ( because I am not gay it would be strictly out of spite ) make my marriage any stronger .
I do not agree with the Atheist belief ( much like I do not agree with the homosexual lifestyle ) but I do not deny the Atheist the right to marry .
Paul Zieger - 11/17/2008
It seems to me that when a minority petitions for a right , they are stating that said right EXISTS and wish it to be recognized .
When a court gives its ascent it is acknowleging the existence of this right , not just spontaneously but for time immemorial .
I think we differ on the source of rights .
It appears you see them as " granted " by a court , whereas I believed they are " created " , bestowed upon a nation who 's government is to protect them .
A court that grants rights can remove them .
A court that recognizes rights as created and bestowed cannot ethically mold those rights to meet their liking .
Paul Zieger - 11/17/2008
Harems are utilitarian , which is defined as exhibiting or stressing utility over other values .
Free flowing uninhibited sex stresses the supremacy of a man 's base sexual desires over values such as love , and self - sacrifice .
The only utilitarian marriage , my friend , is a very brief one .
" Human rights are something we have the ability to recognize as individuals ? "
Where does one derive this ability ?
Is n't one role of government to safeguard human rights , which are not pronouncements of any one judicial system but pre-ordained and eternal ( I would say the exception to this is the right to vote which only exists in democratic structures as opposed to monarchies ) .
It is only when rights become government inventions that they can be granted and removed .
A " marriage " between two men does effect me because it is not truth .
If 90 % of the country insists that the color of grass is green because it IS and a very vocal hip smart 10 % minority say its really pink , can it be both so that everyone is happy and no one is hurt .
Are the people that believe grass is green strengthened by this or has truth been trumped by guile .
And as for the family structure , the single parent variety is a societal disaster on so many levels , I do n't know where to begin ( and wo n't ! )
While social pressures effect family structure , do n't we as a society function at a level above simple acquiescence .
Randll Reese Besch - 11/17/2008
The " parts fitted " that way as well .
Do n't we function at a level above simple utilitarianism ?
Human rights are something we have the ability to recognize as individuals .
Two men marrying or two women will not change one iota the ' traditional marriage ' in any way .
If anything it will be strengthened .
Check out the 9th Amendment of the Bill of Rights .
There is a reason why it is still ignored from its inception .
It simply states it covers all the other myriad rights not enumerated .
Very powerful .
A minority is a group that does not have the numbers and in a voting scheme of democratic socialism , will lose out more often than not .
Must I really explain it or are you being supercilious in this context ?
As for the building block of society well no .
The so - called nuclear family was a recent invention .
Before it was an extended family structure .
Now the common structure is a single parent .
That will change in the future as social pressures change .
Craig Michael Loftin - 11/17/2008
Of course merely petitioning for a right does not grant the right .
But a minority group should be able to petition for a right and have it reviewed , vetted , and ultimately judged upon by the judiciary .
Frivolous petitions will not get far .
In this case , the California State Supreme Court heard the arguments for and against and ruled in favor of gay marriage .
While the political right decries " activist judges " in cases such as this , it should be remembered that six of the seven Ca. State Supreme Court justices were appointed by Republican Govs .
This is hardly some crazy left wing court gone wild , but I think reflects a sober ( and in my opinion wise ) assessment of minority rights .
And I think their judgement is well aligned with the gist of the Federalist Papers which discussed protection of minority rights from the " tyranny of the majority . "
Paul Zieger - 11/14/2008
By this argument , any " minority " ( whatever that means ) can petition for a right and the majority is powerless to have any say .
What say does the majority have in shaping our societal structures ?
Also I would proffer that marriage as man and wife is not strictly a religious construct - but an affirmation of obvious biological realities ( the parts fit ) .
It is the reproductive and socialization building block of societies for time immemorial .
That 's not something to be brushed aside lightly .
Randll Reese Besch - 11/14/2008
Then decide if under the Constitution / bill of Rights there are no violations by those who wish to limit it to a religiously designated man and woman only .
Personally to me the state is there to protect the rights of all not just some .
Read the much ignored 9th Amendment for those rights not enumerated .
A civil right ?
Yes !
Unless you are going to say that it is only a religious right .
Or that it is a right of a theocracy where Church and and state are one .
Then we can toss the Constitution / Bill of Rights for they would violate many tenants of the Christian Bible .
Tangled is n't it ?
The very idea of a majority voting on minority rights is criminal .
As the vernacular of today is " whack ! "
The rights should exist .
Otherwise anyone 's rights are subject to their removing them .
The idea that taking rights is equivalent to recognizing them is also a terrible idea against freedom of the individual .
How about this rule .
If you do n't like it do n't do it but leave others who wish to do it alone .
John R. Maass -

I do n't know the answer to that one , but doubt there was any right at all .
I also point out that had the measure failed , I seriously doubt we'd be reading this same article .
If you 're a discerning eater , you know the age - old mantra : everything 's better with bacon .
Out in Germany , they 've really taken it to heart , and have made fabric gadget cases that look like they 're constructed out of every gentile 's favorite pork product .
The Bacon Case seems to come in different sizes , at least one of which can fit the iPhone , and is selling for 25 Euro .
The description 's all in German , and I do n't know what or who a " Frühstücksspeck " is , but the case is " Absolute Trendtasche ! ! ! " and who am I to argue with that ?
More pictures after the jump .

Ruby on Rails has become a very popular Ruby framework for creating web applications in recent years .
An aspect of creating a web application is the need to repeatedly create the same base functionality over and over , until RailsKits came along to help ease the pain .
These are the tasks developers need to complete before moving on to the heart of the application .
Most applications using Ruby on Rails implements some type of authentication , payments , automated billing and other repeated aspects of business application development .
RailsKits is designed to solve these problems quite easily .
InfoQ had the opportunity to talk with the creator of RailsKits , Benjamin Curtis , to learn more about this concept and the various types of RailsKits available and their uses .
Related Sponsored Content The DevOps Engineer 's Guide to Kubernetes Configurations Best Practices
Robert Bazinet ( RB ) : Who is Benjamin Curtis ?
Benjamin Curtis ( BC ) : I'm an entrepreneur , startup junkie , and Rails developer based in Seattle , WA .
I enjoy everything related to running online businesses , from conceptualization , to development , to promotion .
I blog about web development in general and Rails in particular , I run the Rails plugin directory , and I enjoy contributing to open source projects as I get the time .
An area of online business that I 'm particularly interested in is e-commerce , having built a large - scale storefront in the early days of Rails , through to the present where I 'm still building e-commerce solutions like NextProof , a self - service storefront portfolio and storefront builder for professional photographers .
RB : What are RailsKits ?
BC : RailsKits are starter Ruby on Rails applications that help developers get a quick start on their applications that have a need for common , plumbing - type functionality such as recurring billing .
Basically , the idea is that there are some problems , like securely storing credit card numbers and charging them on a monthly basis , that are fairly generic and do n't add much value to your particular application , so why spend your time re-inventing the wheel ?
Get the RailsKit that provides the solution to that problem , and get on with the interesting stuff .
RB : How did you come up with the idea for RailsKits ?
BC : I came up with the idea for RailsKits after having built a couple of software - as - a - service ( SaaS ) web applications .
Since I primarily work on B2B applications based on the freemium model , I found I was re-using the billing code I had written for earlier projects as I started new ones .
As I did this , I realized that I did n't really enjoy working on that kind of code , since it 's not terribly fun , etc. , and I figured there were other developers in the same boat .
Given the choice , they 'd like be happy to buy code that already implemented recurring billing -- spending a little bit of money to save a lot of time and get their applications delivered more quickly .
So , I extracted the billing component that I had polished up over the course of a few projects , packaged it up , and offered it for sale .
RB : What are the particular problems RailsKits intends to solve ?
BC : I 've mentioned recurring billing / customer subscription management as one area that has a RailsKit solution .
Another RailsKit , recently released , provides a platform for building mapping applications by implementing the Google Maps API and handling the goecoding and map marking for you .
A third RailsKit , the OpenID Kit , which I offer for free at the site , gives Rails developers a starting point for building applications that use both classic username / password logins , as well as OpenID logins .
So , as a developer , you do n't have to worry about the OpenID API , or even integrating the OpenID Rails plugin ... you just download the Kit and start building your app with those login methods already in place .
RB : What types of projects are good candidates for RailsKits ?
BC : If you are a developer building an application that has a common need , such as recurring billing , or OpenID authentication , that application is a great candidate for using a RailsKit as a starting point .
Applications that are solving entirely new problems may not be a good fit .
RB : What are the various RailsKits you offer and what are their purpose ?
BC : The first Kit is the SaaS Rails Kit , which provides a starting point for a subscription - based web application .
If you want to build a multi- tenant web application that bills your customers monthly by credit card , this Kit will provide you the recurring billing code and the ability for customers to create and up / downgrade their accounts .
It also gives you a framework for maintaining data privacy among customers , and for implementing product plan tiers based on limits such as number of users on an account , the amount of storage space used , etc .
Other Kits include a sample implementation of the PayPal API , an implementation of OpenID , and an extension for Radiant that adds the ability to have a members - only section for a Radiant - based site .
RB : What type of support do you offer with the kits ?
BC : I offer email support for any questions related to implementing , customizing , and deploying applications based on the Kits .
I also host mailing lists for customers to help each other with questions .
RB : Since the kits are open source what type of license are the kits released under and how can developers enhance the kits and distribute them ?
BC : You do get the source when you purchase a Kit , but it 's not under an open source license .
The license allows you to use and modify the source code , but not redistribute it , except in the case where you are a building a solution for a client using a Kit as a starting point .
Then you can , of course , share the code with that client .
RB : Is it possible to give our readers some examples of how some customers are using the kits ?
For example some sites readers may find interesting which were created using the kits .
BC : The first customer application to be deployed using the SaaS Rails Kit is NextProof , an e-commerce platform for professional photographers .
This was a client project of mine , and it was during this project that I took the billing code that I originally created for Catch the Best and extracted it out into framework that could be easily re-used in a variety of projects .
Sifter is another site using the SaaS Rails Kit .
RB : I noticed you built a rather unique application with one of the kits you offer to find local office space .
Can you tell us about the kit and the application created ?
BC : Recently I launched the Map Rails Kit , which makes it super - easy to build a Google Maps mashup .
It has an implementation of the Google Maps API , and it includes address geocoding for you , so all you have to do is have a list of addresses , and the Kit will take care of geocoding them and putting them on the map for you .
It 's so easy to put up a mapping application with this Kit , that I put one up myself at OfficeMapper .
Since my current office lease is coming to an end soon , I 'm shopping around for new office space , so I created a script that pulls the address office rental listings from Craigslist and maps them using the Kit .
Now I can see visually what office space is available near my house .
RB : What type of RailsKits do you plan to offer in the future ?
BC : I have three or four Kits in various stages of completion , some more tailored to being good examples of common implementation questions ( like the PayPal Rails Kit ) , and some more targeted at being a drop - in solution for commonly - needed functionality in all Rails applications ( like the SaaS Rails Kit ) .
I 'll be making some announcements soon ( and offering discounts , too ! ) on the Rails Kits mailing list , so be sure to sign up in the footer at the RailsKits web site .
More information about all of the RailsKits can be found on the company 's web site .

Myanmar Court Sentenced Pro-Democracy Activists to 45 and 68 Years in Prison
The court of Myanmar , a military - ruled country , sent a prominent monk and the country 's famous comedian to prison .
Both were members of pro-democracy movement in Myanmar .
The comedian 's lawyer , Khin Htay Kywe , outlined that the court sentenced her client Zarganar to 45 years under Myanmar 's Electronics
Act , which monitors all forms of electronic communication , reports MSNBC .
She added that the activist still faces several other charges .
A lawyer who decided to remain unidentified said that the Buddhist monk , Ashin Gambira , who was one of the organizers of pro-democracy demonstrations in 2007 , was sentenced to 12 years on several charges .
Due to the previous 56 - year prison term , the total sentence of the monk equals 68 years .
During a Q&A panel at the San Diego Comic - Con , Prince of Persia creator Jordan Mechner revealed that he is working on a followup to Karateka , the first video game he developed .
Published in 1984 when Mechner was attending Yale University , Karateka featured impressive fluid animation that laid the groundwork for his influential 1989 game Prince of Persia .
" There actually is a plan to bring back Karateka , " the designer said .
" It 's a project I 'm going to be involved in .
I can safely say it 's not going to be in the way you expect . "
Asked by Gamasutra whether the project is indeed a video game , Mechner confirmed that it is .
Responding to a separate question about the original Karateka , Mechner recounted how he and one of the game 's other programmers pulled off one of gaming 's stranger Easter eggs .
" The programmer doing copy protection for the game figured out that by messing with the bit table , the whole game could be played upside down , which is really hard to do , " he explained .
" We thought it would be hilarious if we burned the flipped version of the game to the other side of the disk .
" We figured of all the people who buy the game , a couple of them would accidentally put the floppy in upside down , " he continued .
" That way , when that person calls tech support , that tech support rep would once in blue moon have the sublime joy of saying , ' Well sir , you put the disk in upside down , ' and that person would think for the rest of their life that 's how software works . "
As it turned out , brass at publisher Broderbund was receptive to the idea : " We went do the president of Broderbund to propose this , and we did n't think they'd go for it , because it would require an assembly line change to actually burn the game onto both sides of the disk , which adds however many cents .
So we went in , and he said , ' Sure .
Do it . ' "
In honor of Veterans Day , which is today , USF is holding a blood drive .

Ever had a birthday party in the office ?
If you have , you know that it ’s usually celebrated with a streamer - covered cubicle , a signed birthday card , and a mid-afternoon birthday cake .
And while everyone says they do n’t want that cake , let ’s be honest : after you start to include it in your diet two to three times a week , you ca n’t stop jonesing for that two o’clock sugar rush .
Of course , after the parties happen the partially - eaten leftovers find their way to the office kitchen .
Now , if you want to get in on the game , you ’ll need to follow these Top 4 Tips For Scoring Leftover Office Cake :
1. Keep extra plastic forks and paper plates at your desks .
Because how many times do you happen upon a partially - devoured cake , only to notice that there ’s nothing to eat it with ?
Put up your icing smeared hand if you ’ve ever just dug into that cake anyway .
Yeah , I ’m talking about slicing the cake with a coffee stirrer , using a piece of paper from the printer as your plate , and just tossing the cake back like a crumbly Jello shooter .
It ’s not pretty and it ’s sort of crossing the line between Friendly Coworker and Office Raccoon .
I say do n’t be the raccoon .
Keep the cutlery at your desk .
2 . Do your cubicle rounds .
On your way into work in the morning , make sure you do your cubicle rounds .
You know , just checking out if anyone ’s cubicle is all decorated for their birthday .
If you spot one , it ’s a good omen of cake to come .
3. Buddy up .
When they find cake , they tell you .
When you find cake , you tell them .
There ’s always enough to go around , so why not double your odds of scoring an icing flower ?
You know you have a great Cake Buddy when you find a piece of cake covered by a napkin just sitting at your desk when you get back from a meeting .
Now that ’s service .
Make sure to thank them with a corner piece next time .
4 . Know the peak times .
Office birthday parties nearly always happen in the afternoon because this allows someone to hastily run out and grab a cake at lunch .
So make sure you ’re ready and aware of those mid-afternoon ‘ fake meetings ’ that turn into office birthday parties .
Also , it does n’t hurt to swing by the kitchen at 2:30 to see what ’s cooking , if you catch my drift .
Now these are all great methods for how to score leftover cake from the office kitchen , but what happens if you ’re invited to the actual office birthday party itself ?
Well , do n’t you worry , we ’ve got you covered with one big rule :
If you ’re at the party , do n’t be the Table Setter , Servant , or Salesman .
You must make a strong effort to avoid these three dreaded office party tasks because they will delay your cake eating :
The Table - Setter : the person who is assigned the role of finding plastic forks , paper plates , or drink cups at the last minute .
It ’s just no fun leaving the party to run around and beg for Styrofoam .
Best to show up a bit late or mingle undetected in the back .
The Servant : the person who ends up closest to the cake … just in time to cut it for everyone !
Yeah , now you ’re stuck trying to split up those much - too - thin paper plates , put a fork on each one , and slice that cake right on up .
It ’s a lot of pressure being the Servant , because everybody is always crowding around you and yelling things like “ No , no , no , half that size ! ”
And it can all happen so fast that you do n’t even realize you ’re The Servant until you find yourself in the bathroom twenty minutes later awkwardly washing the cake knife with cold water and paper towels .
The Salesman : the person who takes the cut pieces of cake and walks around the room selling them to everybody .
If you get the job , your best move is simply asking “ Who does n’t have a piece yet ? ” and then waving the cake in people ’s face until they take it off your hands .
So that ’s it , ladies and gentlemen .
Now you ’ve got it down .
Bring on the sugar comas , because you ’re entering a world of all cake all the time .
And it will be glorious .
AWESOME !

The McCain campaign provided no details about the time or place of the meetings or the issues to be discussed .

But it is likely that Mr. Kissinger , a close outside adviser to Mr. McCain ’s campaign , will give Ms. Palin a broad overview of international affairs , focusing particularly on Russia , China and the Middle East .
Mr. Kissinger , who was national security adviser and secretary of state in the Nixon and Ford administrations , is regularly called on by Mr. McCain for advice on foreign affairs .
But Mr. Kissinger differs with Mr. McCain on some key aspects of foreign policy , including his support for direct American negotiations with Iran without conditions .
Mr. Uribe is certain to talk to Ms. Palin about a crucial issue between his country and the United States , a trade proposal that would lift tariffs on many goods .
Mr. McCain argues that the pact would open up markets for American manufactured goods and farm products and bolster relations with an important ally that receives about $ 600 million a year in counterinsurgency and anti-narcotics aid .
But Senator Barack Obama , the Democratic presidential nominee , opposes the trade deal , because of fears among American workers about job losses and concern among labor leaders about the killings of union officials in Colombia .
The proposal has been held up by Democrats in Congress .
WASHINGTON  Congressional Democrats were drafting legislation Sunday for tight government control of the crippled American auto industry , including the possible creation of an oversight board made up of five cabinet secretaries and the head of the Environmental Protection Agency and led by an independent chairman or “ car czar . ”
While the form of oversight was still to be negotiated by Congressional Democrats and the White House , the talks made clear the extent to which the auto companies would have to submit to substantial government supervision in order to receive a taxpayer - financed bailout .
Whatever oversight entity is created , it would direct the drastic reorganization plans that the auto companies have said they were willing to undertake in exchange for billions of dollars in short - term government loans to keep them in business , a senior Congressional aide said .
A main factor complicating the deliberations was the imminent transition between the Bush and Obama administrations .
The discussions of how strong a hand the government should take with the auto industry came as Congressional and White House negotiators sought to put the final touches on emergency bridge loans of about $ 15 billion to keep General Motors , Chrysler and Ford afloat .

SAS chief quits over ' gross negligence ' that killed his troops
' Gross negligence ' : Corporal Sarah Bryant , 26 , was the first British woman to die in active service in Afghanistan
A commander of the SAS in Afghanistan has resigned – blaming the Government 's failure to provide adequate kit for the needless deaths of four of his colleagues .
Major Sebastian Morley criticised the ' gross negligence ' of Whitehall officials and military commanders .
He said they repeatedly ignored his warnings about the vulnerability of Snatch Land Rovers .
Four troops were travelling in one of the lightly armoured vehicles when it hit a landmine in Helmand province on June 17 this year .
The blast split the car apart , killing those inside – Corporal Sarah Bryant and SAS soldiers Corporal Sean Reeve , Lance Corporal Richard Larkin and Paul Stout .
Corporal Bryant was the first female soldier to die in Afghanistan .
In his resignation letter , Major Morley , the commander of D Squadron 23 SAS , blamed ' chronic underinvestment ' in equipment by the Ministry of Defence .
The 23 SAS regiment is one of two Special Air Service reserve units and Major Morley was the most senior reservist officer in the SAS .
An MoD spokesman last night confirmed Major Morley 's resignation , saying it was made for ' personal reasons ' .
But colleagues of the officer disclosed his growing fury at the continued use of the Snatch vehicles despite their obvious shortcomings .
The Land Rovers – which were initially designed for use against rioters in Northern Ireland – were nicknamed ' mobile coffins ' by servicemen .
The Major criticised the MoD 's failure to buy better equipment as ' cavalier at best , criminal at worst ' .
A soldier who served with Major Morley said : ' We highlighted this issue , saying people are going to die and now they have died .
The point of failure here lies squarely with the MoD . '
The Major 's resignation will reignite the debate on the standard of equipment given to British troops .
Snatch Land Rovers have been involved in 34 British deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq – one in eight of the total .
Coroners have repeatedly criticised the MoD for failing to supply vehicles which are resilient enough to protect troops from roadside bombs .
Major Morley 's decision to quit follows resignations on similar grounds by Lt Col Stuart Tootal and Brigadier Ed Butler .
It has also been reported that SAS reservists were aghast to hear that only Snatch vehicles were available when they were preparing to send a squadron of about 100 men to Helmand province .
Emails were sent to Whitehall planners in the MoD , protesting at the decision , but they were told to ' get on with it ' .
In a statement the MoD said : ' The events of 17 June were a tragedy and our sympathies are with the families .

* Despite the setbacks in Iraq and Afghanistan there has been a recent peak in public support for the Armed Forces , with a 12 per cent surge in recruits .
In the 12 months to the end of June , 17,860 men and women joined the services – 2,250 more than the same period the previous year .
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) -
An Iraqi court on Sunday ordered the release of a freelance photographer working for Reuters news agency who has been held by U.S. forces since early September .
The Iraqi Central Criminal Court ruled there was no evidence against Ibrahim Jassam Mohammed , and ordered that the U.S. military release him from Camp Cropper prison near Baghdad airport .
Iraqi prosecutors acknowledged in remarks included in the court ruling that there was a lack of evidence , and said they were closing the case against Jassam .
A copy of the court order was supplied to a lawyer working for Reuters .
There was no immediate response from the U.S. military to the ruling .
Under a security pact signed between the United States and Iraq , the 16,000 - 17,000 detainees currently held by U.S. forces will have to be released next year if they have not been charged , or handed over to Iraqi authorities .
The pact paves the way for U.S. forces to withdraw from Iraq by the end of 2011 .
“ I ’m pleased to learn that a court ordered Ibrahim Jassam released as there was no evidence against him , ” said Reuters News Editor - in - Chief David Schlesinger .
“ I hope the U.S. authorities comply with this order swiftly to reunite him with his colleagues , friends and family . ”
Jassam was detained in early September in a raid on his home in Mahmudiya by U.S. and Iraqi forces .
His photographic equipment was also confiscated .
Jassam works for other Iraqi media , in addition to Reuters News , a Thomson Reuters company .
Mahmudiya , some 30 km ( 20 miles ) south of Baghdad , was once one of the most violent areas of Iraq but security there has improved in step with a sharp drop in attacks across Iraq .
Reuters and international media rights groups have criticized the U.S. military ’s refusal to deal more quickly with suspicions apparently arising from reporters ’ legitimate activities covering acts of violence .
In August , the U.S. military freed a cameraman working for Reuters after holding him for three weeks without charges .
It had been the third time Ali al - Mashhadani , who also conducts freelance work for the BBC and Washington - based National Public Radio , had been detained .
The U.S. military says the U.N. mandate authorising its presence in Iraq allows it to hold anyone it deems a threat indefinitely .
That mandate expires on December 31 .
A few days ago , someone emailed me asking me if I had a recipe for honey cake .
You see , honey cake is something traditionally eaten on the Jewish New Year , which falls next week as eating honey is supposed to encourage a sweet New Year , doubly so if paired with apples .
But every honey cake I have been forced to try has been wretched ( apologies if it was yours ) .
They were dry and never sweet enough .
They were coarse and totally unloved .
And if I find myself at an occasion where I see a honey cake , well , I wonder why they did n’t ask me to make dessert instead , but then I steer clear of it just the same .
This life is too short to eat terrible cake .
I said as much to this reader , and that ’s when it hit me :
Right , this is my job !
This is what I do !
I take things that I think are terrible and I try to find a better way to go about them .
That ’s why this person emailed me , right ?
( Sometimes I forget . )
And seeing as I do n’t dislike honey , and I do n’t hate spices and I do n’t hate tradition or the Jewish New Year , well , it was time .
I did a bit of research and learned that there was a recipe out there by one Marcy Goldman that people are quite mad for–in a good way .
And I was feeling pretty good about the copious tastes I ’d had of the batter ( um , before remembering how much booze was in there and look at that !
It ’s party time in here ! ) when it went in the oven but then .
Well then something terrible skitted across the floor and I just do n’t want to talk about it .
I screamed –like movie starlet screamed , ungh–and dropped the spatula .
And by the time I got off the phone with Alex [ “ Come home NOW .
Come home NOW .
Come home NOW . ” ] and somewhat talked myself off my I ’m - leaving - NYC - and - never - coming - back ledge , I realized that the cakes had fallen in the oven .
And now , dear reader , I am torn as to whether this recipe needs to come with a warning .
Was it my scream and the ensuing trauma that made the cakes fall ?
Are there issues with my baking soda ( quite likely , it ’s old as dirt ) ?
Is there something wrong with this cake recipe ?
( I doubt this , nobody else who has mentioned it made reference to a sunken midsection . )
Are you completely horrified that I shared this story ( despite my mother asking me nicely to spare you our shameless details ) ?
I ’ll tell you what I do know , though :
This honey cake is perfect .
It ’s warmly spiced and crazy moist and soft and plush with a little crisp edge about the corners and if you know someone with a thing for honey cake , be they bringing in the year 5769 with revelry or not , you ’ve got to wow them with this one .
Concave or not , it is everything honey cake was once supposed to be , and with this recipe , might be again .

The Senate will begin debate within minutes on their attempt to revive the bailout bill rejected by the House .
They have released the bill text this morning , and the Senate Conservatives Fund website has it for public perusal .
The new version has no allocations going to the Housing Trust Fund , which the Dodd version originally did , so ACORN will get no money from the bailout .
However , the Senate did add a few winners to this new version :
New Tax earmarks in Bailout bill
– Film and Television Productions ( Sec. 502 )
– Wooden Arrows designed for use by children ( Sec. 503 )
– 6 page package of earmarks for litigants in the 1989 Exxon Valdez incident , Alaska ( Sec. 504 )
Tax earmark “ extenders ” in the bailout bill .
– Virgin Island and Puerto Rican Rum ( Section 308 )
– American Samoa ( Sec. 309 )
– Mine Rescue Teams ( Sec. 310 )
– Mine Safety Equipment ( Sec. 311 )
– Domestic Production Activities in Puerto Rico ( Sec. 312 )
– Indian Tribes ( Sec. 314 , 315 )
– Railroads ( Sec. 316 )
– Auto Racing Tracks ( 317 )
– District of Columbia ( Sec. 322 )
– Wool Research ( Sec. 325 )
I love the auto racing tracks in particular .
I can see the headlines now : “ Global financial markets melt down , NASCAR , Caribbean rum hardest hit ” .
As many people have said now , I ’d be more inclined to take this crisis seriously if people on the Hill did n’t use it to butter up their favored constituencies .
The Senate will vote at around 7:35 PM tonight on this bill .
I ’d expect an easier passage , thanks to provisions to expand FDIC insurance and an added authority to suspend mark - to - market rules that may make some of the rest of this bill unnecessary .
Senate leadership is n’t taking any chances ; they ’ve added this as an amendment to a bill containing some legislation sought by both liberals and conservatives , making it difficult to oppose from any direction .
Update : My friend Sean from Everything I Know Is Wrong returns to blogging on this issue , and takes issue with Arianna Huffington ’s analysis of the crisis .
We need more people pushing back on the notion that a lack of government action caused this collapse ; it was a government distortion of lending and investment sectors that caused the problem .
But to the extent that government inaction contributed to it , it ’s good to recall exactly who the obstructionists were .
Update II : Apparently the load on the SCF server has created some problems .
I ’ve loaded the PDF file here .
Update III : I ’m being told from multiple sources that the term “ tax earmarks ” is incorrect and misleading .
Americans for Tax Reform has sent out a memo explaining the difference ( and note that the “ Ed ” in this does not refer to me but a staffer on the Hill ) :
The language Ed uses below here is very unhelpful and completely wrong from a fiscal conservative perspective .
There is no such thing as a “ tax earmark . ”
Earmarks are spending .
There are appropriations earmarks .
There are authorization earmarks .
There are no “ tax earmarks . ”
To claim that there are puts tax deductions and credits ( which is what we ’re talking about here ) on the same par as bridges to nowhere .
Was the creation of HSAs a “ tax earmark ? ”
How about the home mortgage interest deduction ?
One might call for lowering the rates and broadening the base , but we should not fall into the trap of equating tax cuts and spending increases .
That ’s how some Senate Republicans got in such massive trouble over health care last year and energy this year vis - à - vis taxes .
This is precisely the same logic that Treasury ’s Steve Surrey used in the 1960s to create the “ tax expenditure ” concept .
This faulty doctrine treats tax exclusions , adjustments , deductions , and credits as if they were the same as a federal appropriation .
They are not .
They might not be ideal tax policy , but they are federal revenue reductions — not budget increases .
I would exempt from my statement the outlay effects of refundable tax credits .
Those are , indeed , spending and could rightly be sullied with the term “ earmark . ”
I ’m sorry to be so firm about this , but it ’s this confusion between tax cuts and spending increases that I ’ve found is the number one cause of well - meaning offices slipping into Taxpayer Protection Pledge violations .
When I see things communicated that would contribute to this confusion ( and I know Ed meant no harm by it ) , I try to jump all over it .
So these are tax breaks , not earmarked spending .
Perhaps some of them are unwisely added to this bill , but this tax extenders bill passed the Senate with overwhelming support , including the anti-pork Tom Coburn .
It did n’t pass the House initially because of the lack of tax increases to accompany it through Pay - Go .
This scene from 1981 Z - movie Galaxy of Terror will destroy your moral center and make you see giant worms in a whole new light .
You 've got your classic scifi horror plot where a ship crash - lands on a planet answering a distress call . . . and discovers an alien thingamabob that manifests their greatest fears !
One of the crew , whose main characteristic is hotness , is really really scared of maggots .
And so of course , she meets a giant maggot .
Who eats her . . . in a number of ways .
Do n't say I did n't warn you about this one , kids .
Aside from being one of the perviest , cheesiest flicks I 've ever seen , Galaxy of Terror is packed with groovy B - list actors like Erin Moran ( Joanie from Happy Days ) , a peppy , cute pre-Nightmare on Elm Street Robert Englund , bad guy Ray Walston ( Mr. Hand from Fast Times at Ridgemont High ) , and a seriously tough captain played by Grace Zabriskie ( the crazy mom from Big Love ) .
And it even has a great , pseudo - philosophical ending with Xanadu - style effects .

Punch Monster and Saddest Turtle in the same week ?
It must be the Buttersafe Birthday Month Madness .
Speaking of which , two pieces of awesome Buttersafe - related art were sent to us this week !
First this rad birthday card ( even if the butter does not remain safe , its enemies are certain to experience severe retribution ) , sent to us by Mister Ted Wood , who you may or may not remember seeing here suffering major damage to his arteries .
Second , this non-birthday related but still crazy sweet video of reader ozwalled drawing everyone ’s favorite romantic , Skeleton Harvester .
If I die , we will have ozwalled take over the Thursday comic spot and do a weekly Skeleton Harvester strip .
[ FUN FACT : my original idea for the Skeleton Harvester comic involved him actually harvesting someone ’s skeleton .
I ’d tell you how he was going to do it , but I think it ’s better if you just imagine what he does with that giant hand of his . ]
Finally , thanks to everyone who wrote in to support me in my kiwi eating habits .
There seems to be a fairly large contingent of us kiwi skin eaters and , quite frankly , I ’m dissappointed that we do n’t receive better media visibility or politcal representaion .
- Alex
P.S. I feel like the Birthday Madness should conclude with a bang .
Something like … Buttersafe Expo 2008 .
Check back next week for the launch of the official convention website .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd says the economic stimulus package announced by the Chinese Government is very good news for the Australian and global economies .
The Chinese Government has announced plans to invest around $ 870 billion over the next two years on infrastructure , post - earthquake reconstruction and housing .
Mr Rudd says it is an " extraordinary " fiscal stimulus package , and shows China is prepared to take a leading role in efforts to solve the global financial problems .
" The Chinese authorities have spoken through the ... press today of the important of taking measures in a new pro-active approach to fiscal policy , " he said .
" I regard that as very good news for this economy , very good news for the regional economy and very good news for the global economy . "
Two weeks ago , 2,000 protesters marched on the Los Angeles headquarters of CNN , shutting down the street .
They banged on the windows ( til one of them ordered them not to ) , they sat in the street , they were determined to make their collective voice heard .
Frustrated , an L.A.P.D. officer asked by megaphone , “ Who ’s in charge here ? ” and someone shouted , “ We all are ! ”
Nobody can look back at the last two weeks and say that something has n’t fundamentally changed within the gay community .
The scope , speed and ferocity of the protests that followed in the aftermath of the passage of Proposition 8 are unprecedented .
The question on everybody ’s mind is “ What now ? ”
The far right and religious conservatives look at the crowds marching in the streets and call it “ terrorism ” , “ fascism ” and “ anarchy ” ; mostly disingenuously , but not always so .
They tell those who will listen to them that marriage equality is the first step to knocking down the churches and that it will force children to discuss sexuality at even the earliest ages .
The words “ witch hunt ” and “ blacklist ” are being thrown about with casual ease .
Their argument is that people should be free to believe in and support a political cause without consequence , willfully ignorant of the fact that they ’ve been denying that same luxury to equal rights advocated for years .
They do n’t like that the tables have been turned .
They point out isolated incidents of limited violence made against Yes on 8 supporters , while ignoring that No on 8 supporters have been attacked as well .
Within the gay community , there are real fissures :
Some new , some old ones brought back to life .
Lori Jean of the Los Angeles Gay & Lesbian Center shouts that the only group to blame for the passage of Prop 8 is the Mormon Church .
This is as simplistic as George Bush ’s characterization of the war on terrorism being a conflict against “ evil - doers ” .
Others lay the blame at the feet of the No on 8 campaign , which myopically put all of its eggs into television advertising and phone banking while actively scoffing at the idea that face time with voters would make a difference .
Like most things in life , there ’s plenty of blame to spread around for the defeat in California .
It ’s true that the Mormon Church mounted an impressive fundraising campaign , but only the naÃ¯ve would think that there would n’t be a ferocious battle for same - sex marriage in one of the most influential and largest states in the nation .
Maybe we needed this to happen .
For Californians to have been granted the right to marry and then have it snatched away again less than six months later made a subtle discrimination blatant , not just in one state , but across the country .
Similar measures in Florida , Arizona and Arkansas that passed on Election Day have made this a national movement and while Prop. 8 remains the focus , most everyone sees this as a battle to eliminate gender and sexuality discrimination from American civic life once and for all .
The California Supreme Court has agreed to rule on the legality of Proposition 8 , but even if the judges rule in our favor , it will be on a process - based technicality and anti-same - sex marriage activists will try again .
We must face the fact that if we are to win , we ca n’t rely on court battle after court battle .
We must be willing to change the minds of at least some of the people who now oppose us .
The difference between challenging someone ’s beliefs and disparaging them is that only one gives you a shot at changing someone ’s mind .
There ’s also the other 33 states that outlaw gay marriage .
If California were to win back its rights and leave the other states to fend on their own , they would be the worst sort of family .
This is a big and daunting fight , but it is the civil rights battle of our time .
There are other important issues that the gay community needs to address : poverty , its own institutionalized racism and misogyny , drug abuse and HIV - related issues , but marriage equality is n’t just a totem .
By demanding that LGBT people be treated equal citizens , it will be easier for more people to live their life without fear .
This will make it easier to reach out to minority communities and the poor .
It will widen our community , introducing more diversity of opinion and it will raise allow gays and lesbians to hold their head up high .
There are three questions that must to drive this revolution .
By discovering the answers , we will be able to chart a course ahead .
The first is , “ Who are we ? ”
On the surface , this question is obvious , but its simplicity is deceiving .
Who makes up the gay community ?
Saying that it ’s just the people who have same - sex attraction is inaccurate–we should not count the Larry Craig ’s and Ted Haggard ’s of the world among us .
The gay community ghettoized itself in cities as a way to protect itself from those who hate us .
We ’ve outgrown the usefulness of the ghetto .
It ’s the final closet the gay community must escape from .
Many gays and lesbians already have and live far away from the bars and clubs of Chelsea , SoBe and WeHo , but they often feel that they have little relation to urban gays , who can be intolerant of anyone , even other gay people , if they do n’t subscribe to the same political and social orthodoxy as they do .
The gay community needs to become a more egalitarian place , not for any intrinsic good , but because we do n’t have the luxury of being choosy about our allies .
We must decide that the only requirement to get your gay card is a commitment to ensuring equal rights for LGBT people .
This means the composition of the gay / queer community will change and that the traditional gay community will have to accept people who will not always agree with them , but this should not be a impediment to a community that prides itself on diversity .
The second question we must ask ourselves is “ What do we want ? ”
The gay community ought to write a Declaration of Equality and it ought to do it openly and transparently .
We must decide what “ equality ” means to us .
Is it civil unions or marriage ?
Should we include removing Do n’t Ask - Do n’t Tell and employment non-discrimination ?
What in essence , are we demanding ?
We must make clear that our interests are in civil rights and that we have no designs on redefining religious institutions .
We must make clear what actions we will take against those who oppose us , whether it be through speech or through dollars .
If we are to boycott , we must boycott equitably .
Does a grocery store clerk who donates to a measure that denies us equality warrant a boycott of the entire chain ?
What if it ’s the CEO ?
By crystallizing our goals we will make a stronger case .
Legislators , business people and mothers and fathers will know exactly what it is the gay community seeks and what the consequences will be for those who seek to defeat us .
We will be defining ourselves instead of letting others define us by unifying our community around a common set of principles .
The final question we must ask is , “ How do we get there ? ”
If we ’ve succeeded in answering the first two questions , we ’ll have gone a long way to answering the third .
We need to actively seek out and enlist people to join our cause , not just in the places we know , but also in places that we ’ve written off .
Â
The Internet holds great promise for helping that along .
These questions cannot be answered by a select few , however .
This needs to be a movement of Gay , Straight , Black , White , Latino , Asian , Republican , Democrat and independent .
It must be a movement that gives a voice to anyone willing to speak up and demand equal rights for all Americans .
This ca n’t be a movement ruled by vanity or ego , but by good ideas and a commitment to justice .
There ’s a sense of inevitability about the gay community achieving equality .
We know we ’re on the right side of history , but being morally right is not enough .
Waiting for public sentiment and understanding to change on its own is not enough .
We must hasten the inevitable–and we must do it the right way , with persistence , love for our fellow neighbor and with open arms to new allies and to new ideas .
“ Who ’s in charge ? ”
We all are .
The new government is now trying to hasten the expansion of antiretroviral treatments .
The task is urgent .
South Africa today is home to 5.7 million people who are H.I.V.- positive  more than any other nation , almost one in five adults .
More than 900 people a day die here as a result of AIDS , the United Nations estimates .
Since the party forced Mr. Mbeki from office and some of his loyalists split off to start a new party , rivalries have flared and stories about what happened inside the A.N.C. have begun to tumble out , offering unsettling glimpses of how South Africa ’s AIDS policies went so wrong .
From the first year of his presidency in 1999 , Mr. Mbeki became consumed with the thinking of a small group of dissident scientists who argued that H.I.V. was not the cause of AIDS , his biographers say .
As president he wielded enormous power , and those who disagreed with him said they feared they would be sidelined if they spoke out .
Even Nelson Mandela , the revered former president , was not immune from opprobrium .
In a column in The Sunday Times of Johannesburg on Oct. 19 , Ngoako Ramatlhodi , a senior party member now running the party ’s 2009 election campaign , recounted how Mr. Mandela , known affectionately as Madiba , was humiliated during a 2002 A.N.C. meeting after he made a rare appearance to question the party ’s stance on AIDS .
Mr. Ramatlhodi described speakers competing to show greater loyalty to Mr. Mbeki by verbally attacking Mr. Mandela as Mr. Mbeki looked on silently .
“ After his vicious mauling , Madiba looked twice his age , old and ashen , ” Mr. Ramatlhodi wrote .
Mr. Ramatlhodi himself acknowledged in a recent interview that in 2001 he sent a 22 - page letter , drafted by Mr. Mbeki ’s office , to another of Mr. Mbeki ’s most credible critics , Prof. Malegapuru Makgoba , an immunologist who was one of South Africa ’s leading scientists .
The letter accused Professor Makgoba of defending Western science and its racist ideas about Africans at the expense of Mr. Mbeki .
A forensic investigator inserts a probe into one of three barrels found outside a Tijuana restaurant .
The barrels contained human remains dissolved in acid .
A handwritten message presumably from " El Teo " warns that all those who walk with a rival drug gang headed by " The Engineer " will be turned into pozole , a stew .

Advertisement A teenager from Ireland has been given a new " million dollar chin " by surgeons in America .
Alan Doherty , 19 , from Donegal , was born with a rare condition called otofacial syndrome , which effectively meant he had no lower half to his face .
His parents were told he was unlikely to survive .
But after a huge fundraising effort by local people , he has become the first person to have a series of operations to create a new jaw and chin .
We are not sure if I will be able to eat or drink , but the main thing I wanted was the chin
Alan Doherty
Alan spent much of his early life in hospital , but coped with not being able to talk or swallow .
However , he found it very difficult to deal with people constantly staring at him in the street .
Doctors took a piece of bone from Alan 's hip , and carved it into the shape of a jaw .
They implanted the bone into his back to grow nerves and supporting tissue around it .
Then they removed the cultivated bone , and performed the delicate pioneering surgery on his face , adding extra tissue to make his new chin look as realistic as possible .
After nine gruelling operations taking more than a year , the result is not perfect , and the likelihood is that Alan will face more operations in the years to come .
He still cannot talk , and must feed himself through a tube , as the doctors in New York have yet to find a way to help him to swallow .
However , the improvement has been huge , and Alan is delighted with the results .
Admiration Speaking through a voice machine , he said : " I feel excellent now that I have finished the surgeries .
I am looking forward to seeing relatives and friends again .
If they stare at him now , it 's only out of admiration
Paul McBridge
Family friend " We are not sure if I will be able to eat or drink , but the main thing I wanted was the chin . "
Family friend and neighbour Paul McBride , who spearheaded the fund - raising in Letterkenny , said : " The most important thing to Alan is that people are not staring at him any more .
He hated people staring at him .
" If they stare at him now , it 's only out of admiration .
" Like any other teenager , he cares about what he looks like .
To him , it 's more important than eating or talking . "

Paris Hilton : Nicole and Joel Out , Benji Madden In
No surprise that there is already chatter aboutandreconciling .
It has been a few weeks since we have seen Paris with a man on her side and the holiday 's are fast approaching .
Panic must be setting in .
Last night 's grand opening of Dolce & Gabbana boutique on Robertson Boulevard seemed to be an awkward scene for some .
Nicole Richie and boyfriend Joel Madden show up on the red carpet for the event to benefit Art of Elysuim .
While the couple was posing for photos , Paris strolled by without even saying boo .
Things changed as soon as her old flame Benji Madden showed up .
Not only did he interrupt her interview - which was most likely about saving the planet , but they went into the store together and chatted it up privately in the corner .
Hilton did tell Ryan Seacrest last month that they were just on a break .
So did they leave together ?
No , Benji departed with Nicole and Joel while Paris lingered with Nicky Hilton and her longtime boyfriend David Katzenberg .

Kites with rotors could fly to where the winds are strongest and send electricity down their tethers to users on the ground .
| Image courtesy of Sky Windpower
Wind power has long been touted as a major energy resource , but for decades no one knew how much energy it could actually yield .
Then three years ago Stanford University atmospheric scientists Cristina Archer and Mark Jacobson did a detailed calculation based on known patterns of air motion .
Using a conservative approach , they counted only the energy that could be generated from winds blowing over land at an altitude of 80 meters , the approximate height of a typical modern wind turbine .
Under perfect conditions , the total would be 72 trillion watts .
It is a handsome quantity .
In 2007 the entire electrical generating capacity of the United States was just a bit more than 1 trillion watts .
But Archer realized that this number barely hints at the potential .
Wind speed rises with altitude , and available power rises at the cube of wind speed .
This means that 72 trillion watts is a lowball estimate .
A few miles up , a turbine blade could generate up to 250 times the energy of the same blade near the ground .
The prospect , Archer says , “ is just super - incredibly exciting . ”
One scheme for harvesting that breezy bounty comes from Bryan Roberts , an engineering professor at the University of Technology in Sydney , Australia , and Sky WindPower , the San Diego–based company developing his work .
The team is designing kites with rotors that fly helicopter - style to altitudes of a mile or more , where the winds are strongest .
Upon arrival , the rotors switch to generating mode , sending current down their tethers , which might be many miles long .
When the winds shift , the platoon of kites ( called flying electric generators , or FEGs ) simply pursue them .
Other teams are working on related approaches .
Of course , as different kinds of wind - power kites come online , there may be challenges :
Will thunderstorms interfere ?
Will a fleet of kites tangle up ?
These questions have apparently stymied the federal government , which thus far has invested nothing .
Some place the blame on image .
Fusion , with much grander problems and bigger unknowns , attracts several hundred million bucks a year .
It ca n’t help that the basic unit here — a kite on a string — is so totally unlike anything in the current energy infrastructure .
The cosmetics are wrong .
One possible alternative : small , ultracheap , low - altitude energy kites , such as those being built at Worcester Polytechnic Institute ( WPI ) in Massachusetts .
Such scaled - down models are intended for niche applications off the grid — for instance , in developing nations .
Unlike FEGs , which carry the generators into the sky and send current down the tether , the WPI kite would bob up and down just a few hundred feet in the air , creating jerks or pulses in the tether that would power a generator on the ground .
The first models look like machines that could have come out of the 19th century , and you can actually see them work ; that might make all the difference .

We need to fix this , now

Looking down the years , technology consistently has helped change the way we program devices .
It is of common knowledge to one and all that without technology and perhaps the Internet , earning a college degree may seem quite tough today , if not impossible .
It is not just about perception , because if it would have been that way , I would acknowledge a student of a demigod status if s/he would have passed a course without the use of Internet .
We have published a lot of articles on open source realm with an inclination towards Linux and free software , primarily keeping in mind the college students and the to - be engineers of the world .
A lot of research has proved the fact that technology usage has increased leaps and bounds .
It certainly provides a jumping off point for an investigation into how students use information technology in college and how it can be harnessed to improve the learning experience .
One may not agree to the changes in the technology being revolutionary , but it is the proponents of the technology who make “ evolutionary ” gains by utilizing the technology and making it a part of their lives .
As new method of interacting with information become more ubiquitous , students will grow up with different expectations and preferences for acquiring knowledge and skills .
The implication is less of an emphasis on the “ sage on the stage ” and a linear acquisition process focusing on a “ single best source , ” focusing on “ active learning ” that comes from synthesizing information from multiple types of media .
But , the problem lies somewhere smartly hiding itself and making us unable to understand the root cause when it comes to implementations in the macro environment .
Graduates are finding it difficult to enter the IT world as freshers and thus finding themselves in a catch22 situation .
So , the question is , what do we do ?
This perhaps may be one of the solutions :
The key to being successful in the IT industry is interning while still attending college and taking some certification courses after graduation .
Do some research .
Find an open source technology company that will provide you with the tools and resources you will need to build your career .
Open source spans platforms , middleware and applications from data centers to desktops .
Get plugged into companies that offer internship programs and certification courses .
Two of the key contributors to Linux and Open Source are Google and Red Hat ( I am deliberately ignoring others ! ) .
Google reports , each time you use the Google search engine , you are using open source software , which relies on the Linux kernel , GCC , Python and Samba , and commits code into each of those projects .
Google maintains a healthy relationship with the open source software development community by releasing Google - created code , providing vital infrastructure , and by creating new open source software developers through programs such as the Google Summer of Code .
Red
Hat offers a summer intern program and certification courses for undergraduates , graduates , and candidates who hold a master ’s degree in business administration .
Google and Red Hat are just a few of many organizations that offer open source opportunities to students .
So take that first step – do some research , get involved with the open source community , find a sponsor , and dive into a potentially lucrative and successful IT career .

As advocates of same - sex marriage turn to courts , protests and perhaps a future ballot measure to overturn Proposition 8 , the Yes - on - 8 campaign manager declared the measure to be “ as over as Barack Obama ’s election . ”
Yes - on - 8 strategist Frank Schubert said the best way to overturn the measure would be to place an initiative on the ballot that would repeal it .
But he doubts that will happen .
“ Politically this was the best chance they could have possibly had , ” Schubert said .
The all - important ballot title written by Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown cast the measure as one that would revoke a right .
The language had been viewed as particularly helpful to people who opposed the measure .
Also , Schubert noted , there was a huge Democratic turnout -- though many Democrats , particularly African Americans and Latinos , do n’t support same - sex marriage and voted for Proposition 8 .
Exit polls showed blacks supported the measure 70 % - 30 % .
One of the closing ads featured Dianne Feinstein .
Popular though she is , Schubert said it was odd that foes of same - sex marriage would tap Feinstein to lecture minorities about discrimination .
“ It had the feel of a lily - white , liberal campaign , ” Schubert said .
He added that the ongoing protests by supporters of same - sex marriage will not help their cause and will have the effect of hardening support for Proposition 8 .
Schubert ’s comments came as Democratic state legislators , including leaders of the Senate and assembly , filed a brief urging that the California Supreme Court void Prop .
8 .
No Republican legislator signed the petition , although Arnold Schwarzenegger , a Republican , denounced the measure in a television appearance over the weekend .
With almost 11 million ballots tallied , Prop. 8 had 52.3 % of the vote , with 47.7 % against .
Although many ballots remain to be counted , the 500,000 - vote spread is viewed as insurmountable .
“ Proposition 8 seeks to effect a monumental revision of this foundational principle and constitutional structure by allowing a bare majority of voters to eliminate a fundamental right of a constitutionally - protected minority group , ’ says the brief , written pro bono by the firm , Gibson , Dunn & Crutcher .
“ If Proposition 8 takes effect , this Court will no longer be the final arbiter of the rights of minorities . ”

76 U.S. Nobel Laureates in Science Endorse Obama for President
Presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama , Harbor Park , Virginia , October 28 , 2008 ( Photo by Jason Pavear )
" This year 's presidential election is among the most significant in our nation 's history , " the Nobel Laureates wrote .
" The country urgently needs a visionary leader who can ensure the future of our traditional strengths in science and technology and who can harness those strengths to address many of our greatest problems : energy , disease , climate change , security , and economic competitiveness . "
" We are convinced that Senator Barack Obama is such a leader , and we urge you to join us in supporting him . "
The scientists warned that an administration headed by Obama 's opponent Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona would not be good for future U.S. scientific endeavors that over the past eight years " have been damaged by stagnant or declining federal support . "
" John McCain 's promise to freeze funding increases for science next year threatens to continue this dangerous trend , " wrote the Nobel Laureates in chemistry , medicine and physics .

" In addition , the reckless statements he and Governor [ Sarah ] Palin [ of Alaska ] have made on specific science programs including studies aimed at protecting the grizzly bear population , funding for a planetarium and research on fruit flies that have the potential to decimate crops brings to doubt their ability to manage the nation 's science programs , " the scientists wrote .
The Nobel Laureates were critical of President George W. Bush .
Their letter warns , " The government 's scientific advisory process has been distorted by political considerations , " the scientists wrote .
" As a result , our once dominant position in the scientific world has been shaken and our prosperity has been placed at risk . "
" We have lost time critical for the development of new ways to provide energy , treat disease , reverse climate change , strengthen our security , and improve our economy , " they wrote .
The Nobel Laureates praised Obama 's plan for managing and growing the nation 's scientific endeavor .
" We especially applaud his emphasis during the campaign on the power of science and technology to enhance our nation 's competitiveness , " the scientists wrote .

The list of 76 scientists includes three of the four American Nobel Laureates in science for 2008 - Martin Chalfie of Columbia University and Roger Tsien of the University of California at San Diego who shared the prize in Chemistry , and Yoichiro Nambu , of the University of Chicago who won the prize in Physics .
Chalfie was the first of the three to make his intentions known .
One of the first actions he took after learning he won the prestigious prize was to contact a friend about signing on to the Obama endorsement letter .
" I understand there 's a list of Nobel Prize winners supporting Barack Obama , and I want to get my name on the list , " Chalfie said .
Chalfie also recorded a YouTube video explaining his endorsement to the public , saying , " The United States is the leader in scientific discovery and its application , but other countries are working hard to take away this lead .
Barack Obama 's administration will continue to keep us the envy of the world . "
Last Tuesday
I gave a talk at the Berkeley Math Circle titled “ All About ( regular ) n - gons ” .
This was a sort of problem seminar that covered a mixed bag of mathematical tricks , but one focus was the use of complex numbers in geometry .
You can download my handout here .
The questions range from fairly basic geometry to research questions — the question “ How many intersection points are formed when we draw all the diagonals of a regular - gon ? ” is much more difficult than it appears at first ; it was first answered in closed form by Poonen and Rubenstein in 1997 .
There was a follow - up problem session this morning , which discussed some of the harder questions .
( though I have yet to see solutions to either of the Miklós Schweitzer problems ) I was impressed to see more than half a dozen students , many of them in junior high , spend two hours on Saturday morning like this .
The last time I talked at Berkeley Math Circle was in 2002 , on generating functions .
Here are some of the more fun problems from my session this week :
What are all the values of for which you can tile the plane with regular - gons of varying size ?
for which you can tile the plane with regular - gons of varying size ?
( Romania 1995 )
Find the number of ways of coloring the vertices of a regular - gon with colors , such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color .
- gon with colors , such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color .
Does there exist a regular - gon such that exactly half of its diagonals are parallel to one of its sides ?
- gon such that exactly half of its diagonals are parallel to one of its sides ?
Show that the sum of the squares of the lengths of all sides and diagonals emanating from a vertex of a regular - gon inscribed in the unit circle is .
- gon inscribed in the unit circle is .
( USAMO 1997 ) To clip a convex - gon means to choose a pair of consecutive sides , and to replace them with three segments , , , where is the midpoint of and is the midpoint of .
In other words , one cuts off the triangle to obtain a convex - gon .
A regular hexagon of area is clipped to obtain a heptagon .
Then is clipped ( in one of the seven possible ways ) to obtain an octagon and so on .
Prove that no matter how the clippings are done , the area of is greater than for all .

I am ambivalent about whether the auto industry should receive the 25 billion dollars that they are begging and pleading for from the U.S. taxpayers .
On the one hand , I realize that millions of jobs depend on the industry and that saving these jobs is not only a humane thing --- it also may help the country ( and even the rest of the world ) from sliding into a deeper recession in the long - term .
On the other hand , I worry that it will be a waste because the industry has lost so much money and so many jobs in recent years that these firms are in a death spiral that is impossible to stop ( GM alone lost 39 billion last quarter ) .
I also believe it will be a waste because the leaders of these firms ( at least GM , which I know best ) are so backward and misguided that the thought of giving these bozos any of my tax money turns my stomach – which is pretty much the same point made by observers ranging from ultra-capitalist Mitt Romney to near - socialist documentary filmmaker Michael Moore .
Recall that Moore made the famous film that attacked GM , Roger and Me .
I do n’t claim to have comprehensive information about the industry , but I have had pretty regular interactions with GM in various capacities over the past 30 years .
I completed my Ph.D in Michigan and had a fair amount of direct contact with GM managers as a student and a lot of indirect contact because my dissertation was on organizational death .
GM closed a lot plants during that time , so I talked with many GM executives , mangers , and workers .
I also have had numerous contacts since as a researcher and occasionally as a speaker at GM events over the past 25 years since I moved to California – for example , Jeff Pfeffer and I spent several days doing interviews at Saturn in Tennessee and with GM executives in Detroit to gather material for The Knowing - Doing Gap .
I hesitate to speak out as I have contacts there who would not be happy to know that I am speaking my mind , but I feel compelled to do so because I feel that GM ’s problems are best described as suicide rather than homicide ( despite their executives ’ claims to the contrary – they seemed to refuse to take any personal responsibility at all during the congressional hearings ) .
And I feel that if we are going to give them billions of dollars , I should do my small part to identify some problems and potential solutions that may help a bit in this uphill struggle for survival .
I could list hundreds of management , cultural , and operational reasons why I believe that GM is such a flawed organization , but to me , a pair of root causes standout :
Most of the senior executives -- and many of the managers -- are ( 1 ) clueless about what matters most and ( 2 ) suffer from a “ no we can ’t ” mindset .
The culture and work practices at GM almost seem designed to create executives who are clueless about what kinds of cars people want to buy and what kind of experiences that car owners want to have -- and about a lot of other important things as well .
The executives were criticized for being so insensitive and clueless that they flew corporate jets to Washington to beg for money ; unfortunately , that is just the tip of a dangerous iceberg .
For starters , my experience with GM is that – more so than any company I have dealt with – the norm in meetings is that the highest status person in the room does all or most of the talking .
Plus , more so than any organization I have ever dealt with , employees are expected to express agreement with their bosses .
Why did n’t anyone have the guts to tell the executives that taking a private plane to beg for a bailout was a bad idea ?
I suspect that it is just standard operating procedure : GM is a culture where subordinates are expected to shut - up and kiss - up when the boss is around .
I can think of a few exceptions , one manager I ’ve met recently in particular .
But on the whole it is as if the system is designed to prevent the upward flow of information .
At first , when I was in graduate school , I thought this was a personality characteristic of the first few GM executives I met .
But then I started keeping track of what happened when managers and executives arrived and left meetings .
To entertain myself as the top dog droned on , I would measure talking time .
Regardless of the subject ( and who had the greatest expertise in the room ) , the highest status person would blab away – and when he or she left the room , the next highest ranking person would then demonstrate GM ’s blabbermouth pattern of leadership .
Note I have been seen this pattern for almost 30 years at GM – the cars have changed but the yakking pattern has not .
Not only are managers and executives insulated from learning what goes in their company because they generally talk rather than listen , they are also insulated from experiencing what it is like to buy and own a car .
GM has a perk for managers down to fairly low levels where all are given a GM car to drive – they rotate from one car to another .
I am not sure of the exact details , but answers to the questions I ’ve asked over the years suggest it goes something like this : the lowest level managers have to buy their own cars , the ones at somewhat higher levels get a new car to drive every six months or so but have to do some servicing , the managers who are somewhat higher - up get somewhat fancier cars and are freed from any servicing ( gas is even put in the cars of some executives so they do n’t have to go to the service station ) , and the highest level executives get a car and a driver .
In other words , this system effectively insulates people in management – especially those in senior management -- from experiencing what it is like to shop for , bargain for , purchase , service , and sell a car .
They only get the driving experience .
Well , except for the most senior executives , who do n’t even get that experience -- they watch a person in the front seat drive a big car .
Now , it is true , that the most senior executives do own GM cars for personal use , but it is my understanding that when a car is delivered to a senior executive , special attention is devoted to the car – even during the production process –to make sure the top brass are n’t exposed to a car with any flaws .
Would n’t that be nice ?
So there you have it , a system that seems designed to isolate executives from reality .
They talk instead of listen and are protected from the experience of owning car .
I might be exaggerating some , but not much .
Whether the current crop of GM executives are fired or not , it seems to me that some major changes need to made , perhaps including :
1 . A limit on the percentage of time that the highest status GM manager or executive can talk during a meeting .
Perhaps 25 % of the time is a realistic goal ?
2 . Only managers who know how to ask questions and to actually listen to people who have less formal power will be hired and promoted .
Failure to demonstrate these skills will be grounds for dismissal .
3. GM managers – and especially top executives – will be required to buy , service , and drive their own cars .
That way , they will experience what it means to own a car .
Now , I feel badly for all the drivers who will lose their jobs at GM ( although I am very curious to know how many executives have drivers – that is a place where I bet we can save a few million dollars in bail out money – and if they sell the private jets like Sara Palin did in Alaska , that is more millions ) .
4 . There are good things and bad things about GM cars ( My family has one , along with three others as we have two teenagers who drive ) – indeed , after years of trailing the Japanese in quality , they have nearly caught - up .
But only owning a GM car does not provide any information about the competition .
As such , if GM does insist on still buying cars for all those executives and managers going forward , at least 50 % of those cars should be from competitors so that decision - makers can experience what it is like to drive – and buy and service – a wide range of cars .
I am sure that GM executives would be horrified to have all those Toyotas and the like in their parking lot ( an auto executive once made my wife park her Nissan around the corner when we lived in Michigan , as he was horrified when she parked it in front of his fancy house in Bloomfield Hills ) .
But they might actually learn something .
Do I believe that that the current crop of executives could transform the GM culture to include these and other practices that will increase their awareness of what is going in their company and in the marketplace ?
No .
It is partly because they are so entrenched .
But it is also because I sometimes believe that the core competence of GM managers and executives is explaining why they are powerless to make sensible changes .
It pains me to say this because the company has a higher percentage of nice people than most other big organizations ( except perhaps for P&G ) , but the “ No we can ’t ” mindset is something that pervades the place .
And , unfortunately , when people believe that organizational change is impossible , it becomes a self - fulfilling prophecy .
If you watched the executives testify to congress the other day , their sense of powerlessness was hinted at in their refusal to take even a token amount of blame for their firms ’ troubles – smart and empowered executives believe and talk like there is a link between their actions and performance , even when bad things happen and even when events are very hard to control ( see this contrary example ) .
But this “ ca n’t do ” mentality is pervasive .
Consider the case of the free GM cars .
This is n’t a new problem .
Many other observers have commented on it before me .
I commented about it very forcefully about to some GM managers a few years back .
I argued that they needed to abolish the program because it caused the whole top of the company to be out of touch with the car ownership experience .
They answered that GM could n’t possibly get rid of the program because they had negotiated such a great tax deal with the state of Michigan ( much better than Ford , they bragged ) and because it was one of the few perks left for white collar employees .
I was not very nice , I argued that this mentality was one of the reasons that the company was in trouble and would get in more trouble .
They treated me like I was insane .
You could also see the “ no we ca n’t mentality ” in the answer GM gave about why they had to fly the private jet to Washington – “ our rules require it for safety reasons . ”
Huh ?
I know lots of CEOs of big companies who fly commercial .
And you may recall that when John McCain ’s campaign was in trouble , he flew commercial for about a year – it seems to me that he was more at risk than some unrecognizable big guy from Detroit .
Could n’t they change the rules ?
I bet the board of directors of GM would be convinced by the argument “ we need to get rid of these planes , we need the money and it looks terrible to congress . ”
I suspect that they are working on this change right now or at least considering it ( Update : Looks like they are getting rid of them . ) .
But , of course , they were so clueless and isolated that it never occurred to them that keeping and flying the private planes were a dumb idea .
Or consider another example -- a really big cause of their problems .
GM has way too many brands .
Toyota has , I think , just Toyota and Lexus .
GM has – if I can remember them all – Pontiac , Chevy , Hummer , Saturn , GMC , Cadillac , and Buick – and I guess now Saab .
There are so many GM models that buyers are bewildered by the differences and – especially among Chevy , Pontiac , and Buick – there is little if any distinct brand identity .
I have asked multiple GM managers and executives why they do n’t just get rid of most these , trimming back to say , Chevy , Saturn , and Cadillac .
This not only would reduce brand confusion it would lead to many efficiencies in advertising , manufacturing , distribution and so on .
They answer , of course , is “ no we can ’t . ”
My answer is that , with all due respect to the dealers , sticking to this business model has created a tragedy of the commons that is bringing everyone down .
In short , my view is that if GM ca n’t figure out ways to get their managers and executives to understand the experience of owning a car for the average person , if they ca n’t get rid of those jets , and if they ca n’t reduce the number of brands , and if they ca n’t make a host of other changes required to make them competitive , than my answer is “ no , you ca n’t have our money . ”
I do n’t usually write such long blogs and do n’t usually rant so much .
But GM ’s predicament just makes me sick .
I saw the pain that people were experiencing in Flint in the early 1980s , the depressed workers and former managers , the ripple effects on businesses , and the helplessness .
It is all much worse now .
I do n’t know if the U.S. auto industry can be saved .
I hope it can and if we are spending 700 billion to bail out the banks , well , then perhaps another 25 billion is worth the risk .
But I ca n’t see how things can change with the current bunch of clowns in charge .
I know that changing the leaders and the culture may not be enough to save GM , but I also believe that without these changes , there is little if any hope at all .
Getting rid of them and instituting an intense program of cultural and organizational change strikes me as the best way to save the company .
Mitt Romney argued today in The New York Times that bankruptcy was the best path for GM and the others .
Perhaps he is right , that creative destruction is only way out of this mess .
Am I being too harsh ?
Am I too biased ?
Do you have more and better ideas ?
Let me know .
The head equipment purchaser at the UK 's ministry of defence ( MoD ) has implied that Britain maintains an open mind on whether it will purchase the new F - 35B supersonic stealth jumpjet to operate from its new aircraft carriers .
General Sir Kevin O'Donoghue , Chief of Defence Materiel , seemed to confirm that there was a backup plan in which the F - 35C catapult launch variant might be used instead .
At present the MoD plans to build the carriers without catapults or arrester wires , meaning that only helicopters and Short Takeoff , Vertical Landing ( STOVL ) aircraft - jumpjets - will be able to fly from them .
Thus the UK has always planned to buy the B version of the F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter ( aka " Lightning II " ) , which features a vertical - thrust fan mounted centrally and a cunning swivelling nozzle allowing its jet exhaust to point downwards .
Possibly not the future Royal Navy fighter after all .
But the F - 35B has long been dogged by weight issues , and though the prototype aircraft has now flown , engine problems have meant that so far it has operated purely as a normal runway aeroplane .
Only after fitting with a new engine will the F - 35 B be able to carry out vertical - thrust flight tests , probably starting early next year .
The Royal Navy is particularly worried about issues of weight and performance in a vertical landing , as the service intends to use the F - 35B as a carrier fighter rather than mainly as a strike plane like most of the other customers .
A carrier fighter needs to be able to take off fully armed , fly a patrol and then land back on the ship without having to dump its missiles beforehand .
The late , great Sea Harrier fighter could just about manage this , but only in cold weather ( cold air lets jet engines deliver more thrust ) .
In warm climates , to make a safe deck landing , the Sea Harrier would normally need to dump weapons - which would be unacceptably expensive .
Hence it was binned to much regret some years ago .
US programme chiefs are adamant that the F - 35B will be able to meet the UK 's weapons bring - back requirement , but there is plainly some doubt in Whitehall .
The UK is carrying out research into a " Shipboard Rolling Vertical Landing " ( SRVL ) where jets would still be moving forward as they landed , but not fast enough to necessitate arrester wires .
This would add some lift from the wings , allowing a safe landing with more weight .
The issue is plainly an important one for the UK , which is now committed to building new carriers and needs planes which can operate from them effectively .
This is what led MPs to question General O'Donoghue on the matter at a meeting of the Parliamentary Defence Committee on Tuesday .
Asked how many F - 35 Bs the UK might buy , the general said :
" Well , at the moment we 're looking at buying three , which are the operational test and evaluation aircraft . "
In other words , the UK will use the initial three F - 35 Bs to find out if they really can be the carrier fighter the Royal Navy needs .
Sir Kevin plainly does n't regard this as a foregone conclusion .
Asked how many jumpjets the UK might buy after the tests , he said :
" Why do n't we wait and see what the operational test and evaluation comes out with ...
Does it do what it says on the tin ? "
Some have suggested that if the F - 35 could n't meet the UK carrier requirement , a " marinised " carrier version of the Eurofighter might be used instead .
This was raised in response to the General 's evident uncertainty regarding the F - 35B .
" It 's not being looked at , no , " replied Sir Kevin .
The F - 35C carrier variant , intended for catapult launch and arrested landing by the US Navy , then came up .
The F - 35C , not requiring the heavy vertical - thrust equipment of the VSTOL jumpjet , will perform better .
It will also be significantly cheaper - perhaps enough to offset much of the cost of providing the carriers with catapults and arrester wires .
Much more money could then be saved by purchasing existing , highly capable carrier radar planes rather than an exotic rotary - wing option such as the TOSS version of the Osprey tiltrotor .
The carriers " could be fitted for the carrier variant , " General O'Donoghue confirmed .
" If STOVL went , then carrier variant must be an option . "
This seems to confirm rumours that the MoD has a backup plan to equip the carriers with catapults and arrester wires early on in their lives , or even during building .
This is n't an entirely simple matter .
Though space has been included in the designs for the necessary machinery under the flight deck , current naval catapults require steam to operate .
The UK carriers , however , are to be propelled by gas turbines rather than nuclear reactors , so as to save money .
But a gas ship , unlike a nuclear one , has no ready source of steam .
Word has it that the UK would , if forced to it , equip the carriers with a separate steam boiler plant for the catapults as well as the gas - turbine propulsion .
This would n't be cheap : a similar plan in France put the cost of a steam 'n ' gas double power solution around 90 per cent of what a nuclear ship would cost - without the nuke ship 's advantages of endurance and extra hangar space .
( Fossil - fuel plants need a lot of thick funnel and intake trunks running up and down through the hangar deck . )
But a catapult carrier would offer a much more capable air group , which also be much cheaper .
From the MoD 's point of view , however , this plan is not desirable as more money would have to be spent earlier on - on the ships , which have now been ordered - and the savings would only come later .
The MoD is desperate for savings right now , and does n't really mind if this leads to more cost down the road - as jumpjet carriers would do , needing pricey STOVL jumpjets and custom - made rotary radar birds .
General O'Donoghue makes it quite plain that the only way the UK will go for the cheaper and more powerful catapult carriers is if the F - 35B can't do what it says on the tin .
Those who want to see the Royal Navy with the best available carriers and jets - and paying less to get them , to boot - might justifiably hope that the miracle jumpjet 's trials next year are a failure . ®
I do n’t know about you , but I have the feeling that many people are interested by OCaml Batteries Included but do n’t dare try it yet , due to the Alpha status and the fact that it ’s not available for their favorite Linux distribution yet .
Well , it ’s probably a healthy level of caution .
Of course , just reading the manual is probably not the best way of getting a feeling of OCaml Batteries Included .
So I ’ve decided to take measures .
From time to time , I ’ll add here a few samples of what you can do with OCaml Batteries Included and how you can do it .
For today , let ’s start with displaying the contents of a file .
You know , Unix ’s cat or MS - DOS ’s type .
open System , IO , File iter ( fun x -> copy ( open_in x ) stdout ) ( args ( ) )
That ’s it .
Three lines , one of them blank .
Now , for details : open System , IO , File opens three modules System ( which contains all system - related functions , including input / output , file management , etc. ) , IO ( the submodule of System containing all the operations on inputs and outputs ) , and File ( the submodule of System containing all the necessary to open files for reading , writing , etc. ) .
Let ’s move on to the last line .
Function iter is defined in module Standard , which means that you do n’t need to open any module to be able to use it .
This function is a general imperative loop on enumerations .
This is the equivalent of loop for - each in some languages .
Perhaps I should detail what enumerations are : they are a read - and - forget data structure used pervasively in OCaml Batteries Included , and which replaces streams .
By opposition to lists , arrays , etc. , enumerations are built lazily and discarded as they are read , which makes them quite convenient for loops , or for accessing possibly huge sets of data — depending on your background , you may think of these either as streams ( in OCaml and most languages ) or as iterators ( in Python , JavaScript and other dynamic languages ) .
Oh , and for functional - minded people , do n’t worry , your usual functional loops are available on enumerations , too .
You can fold , map or unfold at will .
So , what does iter do ?
Well , if asked , OCaml will tell you that it has type ( ' a -> unit ) -> 'a Enum .t -> unit .
In other words , for any type ' a , this function takes as first argument a function ( let ’s call it f ) , as second argument an enumeration of elements of type 'a and returns nothing .
Function f itself should take as argument an element of type 'a and return nothing .
In other words , iter takes a function which works on one element of type 'a and turns it into a function which works on a whole enumeration of elements of type ' a .
Yep , it ’s called a loop .
Before looking at the definition of the function , let ’s take a look at the enumeration passed to iter : args ( ) .
Well , if we look at the documentation ( for instance by using our on - line help ) , we may read
args ( ) :
An enumeration of the arguments passed to this program through the command line .
So , args ( ) is your usual pair argc ; , argv ( if you come from C ) or args [ ] ( if you come from Java ) .
By opposition to Java , you do n’t have to always put them in your program , if you do n’t use them , and by opposition to both , it ’s an enumeration , which makes more sense than an array , since you do n’t need to modify them and since you always move forward among the arguments .
Still , if you need it as an array , it ’s available in a package .
No more on this for the moment .
What ’s left ?
Oh , yes , the function .
As the code indicates , fun x -> copy ( open_in x ) stdout ) is an anonymous function ( also known as a “ lambda ” in a few languages ) .
This function takes an argument x , the name of a file .
Function copy , defined in module IO , takes two arguments , an input ( a source of data ) and an output ( a sink of data ) , and copies the whole contents of the input into the output .
The first argument here is open_in x , that is the result of applying function open_in to argument x .
Function open_in , defined in module File , opens a file for reading .
The result open_in x is therefore an input which lets us read the contents of file x .
The second argument of copy is stdout , that is the standard output , that is the screen .
In other words , fun x -> copy ( open_in x ) stdout ) is a function which takes as argument the name of a file , opens that file and prints its contents on the screen .
Note that everything is done lazily , so the contents is never completely present in memory .
In other words , this works on files of theoretically unlimited length .
Bottom line : this utility reads all the files whose names are given on the command line and prints their content on the screen .
In three lines of code .
Note that we could equally have written our utility
open System , IO , File iter f ( args ( ) ) where f x = copy ( open_in x ) stdout
or
open System , IO , File let f x = copy ( open_in x ) stdout ; ; iter f ( args ( ) )
or , in one line ,
iter ( fun x -> System .IO.copy ( System.File.open_in x ) stdout ) ( args ( ) )
or a number of other variants .
Without Batteries Included , the same code , in OCaml , would have looked like
for i = 1 to Array.
length Sys.argv - 1 do let file = open_in Sys.args .( i ) in let ended = ref false in while not ! ended try print_endline ( input_line file ) with End_of_file -> ended := true do done
Not much longer but definitely more complicated .
Oh , and for fun , here ’s the Java version :
import java.io.* ; public class Demo { public static final void main ( String args [ ] ) { try { for ( String x : args ) { BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader ( new FileReader( x ) ) ; for ( String read = reader.readLine ( ) ; read != null ; read = reader.readLine ( ) ) System.out.println( read ) ; } } catch ( IOException e ) { } } }

ANCHORAGE , Alaska --
There are two things people here remember about Sarah Palin 's debating style during her race for governor two years ago .
One is the stack of color - coded cue cards she took to the podium for help whenever she was asked a policy question .
The other is how quickly she was able to shuck those props , master the thrust - and - parry of jousting with her opponents and inquisitors , and project confidence to an audience of television viewers watching from home .

Rove electoral prediction favors Obama win David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Monday November 3 , 2008
Print This Email This John McCain's Election Day prospects are so bad that even Karl Rove does n't see much chance that he wins .
Rove appeared on Fox News Monday morning to share his pre-Election Day predictions .
His state - by - state model showed Barack Obama taking at least 310 electoral college votes on Tuesday , far more than he needs for victory .
" If McCain hopes to win , he has to win all of the [ toss - up ] states ... then that 's not enough , " Rove said .
" He has to do some takeaway , and the two biggest takeaways are Ohio and Virginia and if he does that he wins the election . "
Obama currently leads in polls in both those states .
Confronted with the stark news that his favored candidate has virtually no chance to win , Fox & Friends host Steve Doocy pulled the morning anchor equivalent of sticking his fingers in his ears and singing , " la - la - la - la I ca n't hear you . "
Ever the reliable conservative hack , Doocy turns the conversation to the latest entirely false GOP attack against Obama -- that his support for clean coal technology and a cap & trade program to moderate carbon emissions is aimed at " bankrupting " the industry .
McCain supports virtually the same approach to moderating pollution from coal - fired power plans .
Doocy noted that two key swing states , Ohio and Virginia , have substantial coal industries , apparently hoping against hope that the attack being pushed by the McCain campaign and Republican National Committee with an assist from Fox , the Drudge Report and right - wing blogs would some how catch on in the last 24 hours before voters head to the polls .

Obama Promises A New Dawn of American Leadership Barack Obama makes history by becoming America 's first black president .
Nov. 5 , 2008  -- Barack Obama cruised to victory Tuesday night in an historic triumph that promised change , overcame centuries of prejudice and fulfilled Martin Luther King 's dream that a man be judged not by the color of his skin , but by the content of his character .
Obama , a first - term senator with little experience on the national level , made history by becoming the nation 's first black president and defeating Sen.
John McCain in a landslide .
In his acceptance speech before some 150,000 supporters in Grant Park in Chicago , Obama complimented McCain on a hard - fought campaign and promised that a " new dawn of American leadership is at hand . "
" It 's been a long time coming , but tonight , because of what we did on this day , in this election , at this defining moment , change has come to America , " Obama said , echoing a key theme of his campaign .
Looking ahead to an economic crisis and turbulent foreign affairs , he told the sea of supporters , " There are many who wo n't agree with every decision or policy I make as president , and we know that government can't solve every problem .
But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face . "
Obama was joined by his wife , Michelle , and daughters Malia , 10 , and Sasha , 7 , and he again paid tribute to his grandmother , Madelyn Dunham , who died Monday a day before his historic triumph .
He had a special message , however , for his daughters .
" Sasha and Malia , I love you both so much , " he said , " and you have earned the new puppy that 's coming with us to the White House . "
Obama had a special text message for supporters as well , telling them digitally , " We just made history .
All of this happened because you gave your time , talent and passion to this campaign .
All of this happened because of you .
Thanks , Barack "
McCain called Obama from Phoenix to concede the election at 10 p.m. in Chicago .
Soon after , the Arizona senator went before his supporters to thank them and graciously applaud the man who defeated his ambitions .
Acknowledging the momentous moment of a black man winning the White House , McCain said , " We 've come a long way from the old injustices that once stained our nation 's reputation . "
" I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us , " McCain said .
" I wish Godspeed to the man who was my former opponent and will be my president , and I call on all Americans , as I have often in this campaign , to not despair in our present difficulties but to believe always in the promise and greatness of America , because nothing is inevitable here .
Americans never quit . "
President Bush also called Obama shortly after 11 p.m. to say , " Mr. President - elect , congratulations to you .
What an awesome night for you , your family and your supporters . "
Bush invited Obama to the White House and said to his successor , " I promise to make this a smooth transition .
You are about to go on one of the great journeys of life . "
Obama 's history - making victory was fueled by his soaring rhetoric , his themes of change and hope in uncertain economic times , as well as deep dissatisfaction with the last eight years of the Bush administration .
Obama 's campaign was historic for reasons beyond his skin color .
He raised more money than any other candidate in U.S. history , and had to first defeat Sen.
Hillary Clinton , who was the party 's early favorite to win the Democratic nomination .
Americans Celebrate in Chicago , New York and D.C .
Voters from a broad swath of America 's diverse ethnic enclaves and economic communities celebrated Obama 's win Tuesday night , particularly those in the African - American community .
Thousand 's flocked to Chicago 's Grant Park to await the election results .
In Harlem and Times Square in New York , Americans took to the streets to celebrate .
There was particular jubilation among black Americans .
The Rev. Jesse Jackson was seen crying in Grant Park when election results were announced .
African - Americans poured into the streets of Washington , D.C. , waving flags , honking car horns and setting off fireworks .
" I 've been an Obama supporter from the beginning , " said Sophie Logothetis , an elementary school history teacher who waited an hour to get into Grant Park , " and I just had to be here . "
In Harlem , Jeff Mann , a 51 - year - old construction worker said , " You can't be anything but joyful .
Obama is going to change the world , " said Jeff Mann , 51 , a construction worker in Harlem .
Crucial to Obama 's victory was winning all of the states that Democrat John Kerry won four years ago and the flipping of Ohio , New Mexico , Colorado , Virginia , Iowa , Florida and Nevada , states that all voted Republican in 2004 .
Obama , 47 , the son of a black man from Kenya and white woman from Kansas , served just two years in U.S. Senate before declaring his candidacy and ultimately taking on one of the most experienced politicians in the United States .
A moderate conservative who tried to emphasize his credentials as a maverick and distance himself from an unpopular president , McCain , 72 , was unable to motivate his base and overcome his associations with Republican incumbent President Bush .
Obama built a coalition grounded on a base of near unanimous support from black voters , who made up 13 percent of the national vote .
Obama also won nearly 70 percent of the vote of Hispanics .
While John McCain was able to win white voters by 54 - 44 percent , Obama made inroads with them as well .
Voters shifted to the Democratic Party in this election , with Republican turnout falling to its lowest point since 1980 .
By almost every quantifiable measure -- from the $ 640 million Obama raised in the month of October to the nearly $ 1 billion the campaigns have spent combined to 9 million newly registered voters -- records have been shattered .
Yet another record may fall once the number of voters is tallied .
Turnout was heavy throughout the day and could surpass previous voting turnout records .
The existing records were set in 2004 when more than 122 million Americans went to the polls , and in 1960 when 64 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot .
Each of the candidates was a dark horse who pundits predicted would never make it past the first weeks of their parties ' respective primaries .
Obama ultimately beat out Clinton for the nomination , the first glimmer of future success .
In perhaps the greatest and most calculated flip - flop of his campaign , Obama forwent public financing allowing him to raise hundreds of millions of dollars from donors contributing small amounts of money , proving that he was not just a neophyte who could make good speeches but a scrappy politician from Chicago .
McCain , too , changed course .
In the final weeks of the campaign , the Arizona senator struck a more negative tone and , along with vice presidential running mate Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska , began attacking Obama 's relationships and judgment .
In the third and final presidential debate , McCain assailed Obama for his relationship with 1960s radical William Ayers and his campaign began aggressively using auto - dialed calls -- known as robocalls -- to voters to relay negative messages , frequently focusing on the Democrat 's experience and readiness for the White House .
That strategy did n't seem to achieve the desired effect , with voters responding in polls in the race 's final weeks that they were turned off by the negative ads and attack tactics .
The economy is nationally the overwhelming issue for voters who cast their ballots in today 's historic presidential election , according to early exit polls .
Despite the possibility of Obama becoming the nation 's first black president , the turnout of black voters as a percentage of the national vote was 13 percent , just slightly higher than in 2004 , according to early exit polls .
The economy has long dominated the campaign , and voters ' concerns became heightened when the major banks and credit markets needed a massive federal bailout to avoid a fiscal catastrophe .
Four in 10 voters said their family 's financial situation was worse than it was four years ago , and eight in 10 are worried the current economic crisis will hurt their family finances over the next year .
McCain Votes and Keeps on Campaigning
In an indication of how intensely fought this campaign had been , both candidates kept holding large rallies and television interviews even as voters swarmed to their polling sites .
In the past , presidential candidates have halted their campaigns on Election Day .
McCain voted early in Phoenix before heading off for some last - minute get - out - the - vote efforts in New Mexico and Colorado , two states where the GOP presidential pick had trailed but hoped to pull out narrow victories .
" I promise you if I 'm elected president , I will never let you down , " an energized McCain told a crowd in Colorado .
" I think we ought to hear one more time ' drill , baby drill , ' " he cheerfully suggested and the crowd obliged with the campaign 's chant .
Palin on Troopergate : ' We Did Nothing Wrong '
After voting at a Chicago school , Obama spent the morning campaigning in Indiana before returning to Chicago to conduct television interviews broadcast via satellite to the swing states of Florida , Pennsylvania , Colorado , Virginia , Ohio , North Carolina , Nevada and Missouri .
Obama voted with his two young daughters in Chicago before he plunged into a final round of campaigning in Indiana .
" I voted , " the Democratic presidential candidate said , holding up the validation slip he was given after turning in a ballot at the Shoesmith School in his Chicago neighborhood .
Obama voted at the same polling station as William Ayers , the former 1960s radical who became a flashpoint in the campaign when Palin accused Obama of " palling around " with a domestic terrorist .
Sarah Palin , McCain 's running mate , voted in her hometown of Wasilla and then joined McCain in Phoenix to watch the results .
After voting , Palin noted that the result would be historic , implying that the voters would elect either the country 's first black president or the first female vice president .
" It bodes so well the progress our country is making , " she said .
MUMBAI , India 
At midmorning on Friday , as Indian troops continued to comb through the devastated Oberoi hotel , an unexpected guest appeared on the sidewalk : Narendra Modi , a Hindu nationalist from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party and arguably India ’s most incendiary politician .
Speaking before a row of television cameras , he said the central government had failed to tackle a growing terrorism threat and he found fault with a speech by India ’s prime minister a day earlier .
“ The country expected a lot from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , ” he said , “ but his address to the nation was disappointing . ”
The appearance of Mr. Modi  who has been barred from entering the United States for violations of religious freedom  signaled how the two - day siege of Mumbai had instantly turned into political ammunition for coming national elections .
After a string of attacks across Indian cities earlier this year , Mr. Modi ’s party , also known as the B.J.P. , pledged to make national security its main campaign issue .
This week ’s audacious attacks on the country ’s commercial capital , and their timing , gave the party an additional boost .
Five state elections are under way , with the city - state of Delhi going to the polls on Saturday .
National balloting is expected to be held next spring .
This is the fifth of our Danger Room Debriefs , where we ask smart folks in the military , intelligence , and homeland defense fields to outline some under - the - radar security issues – and point the way towards potential , often - unorthodox solutions .
* Today we hear from John Robb , a software entrepreneur and former Air Force special operations pilot .
He is the author of * Brave New War .
The current global economic and financial meltdown may yet become something worse : a protracted global depression .
As with the last century 's
Depression , which spawned fascism and WWII , it could recast the world at a fundamental level .
As such , it may soon represent our biggest security challenge in over 50 years .
Here 's what a global depression means :
A proliferation of hollow nation - states globally .
Rampant financial bankruptcy – the double digit percentage growth in the U.S. national debt late this year bode danger here .
Entrenched corruption – think government employees unused to financial deprivation not getting paid except by graft .
An inability to govern territory and a general loss of legitimacy .
A global swiss cheese effect from Mexico to Pakistan , where thousands of small holes in the global security system appear with rapidity .
A
rapid increase in the number and power of criminal guerilla groups that will challenge nation - states .
These groups will flourish within the ungoverned spaces that emerge , particularly in urban areas and even within the U.S.
The combination of access to global markets , rapidly improving technology , and new methods of warfare mean that these groups will be ascendant militarily until successful strategies emerge to counter them .
rapid increase in the number and power of criminal guerilla groups that will challenge nation - states .
These groups will flourish within the ungoverned spaces that emerge , particularly in urban areas and even within the U.S.
The combination of access to global markets , rapidly improving technology , and new methods of warfare mean that these groups will be ascendant militarily until successful strategies emerge to counter them .
Worst of all , these criminal guerrilla groups
( collectively known as global guerrillas ) will be able to generate wealth via transnational criminal networks and control political services to local populations ( through both disruption and parasitically draining national infrastructures ) , gaining legitimacy that nation - states will not be able to provide .
This means that these groups will not only emerge quickly , they will grow stronger over time .
Unfortunately , the U.S. will be forced to navigate this dangerous environment with a small fraction of its former resources .
The endless defense budgets of the last century are gone .
Which means the development of the new strategies – not new gear – to fight this chaotic and complex panoply of non-state foes will become the seminal security challenge of our time .
Can it be accomplished ?
It remains to be seen whether a transition from the legacy mindset of 20th
Century defense to the new environment can be accomplished .
The array of financial incentives , political interests , and bureaucratic inertia arrayed against it are staggering .
Signs that we are on the right track include :
A radical reduction in hideously - expensive weapons systems and dreams of automated warfare
( i.e. the Future Combat System ) , geared towards fighting an increasingly - unikely great power war .
A rapid increase in investments geared towards improving nation - state legitimacy .
We need an array of technologies and processes that both support the construction of resilient communities .
And we need the means to train , manage , and control ( or punish , if the need arises ) the militias / paramilitaries that will blanket the global landscape .
A move towards much more flexible military platforms and systems that can be rapidly configured to provide tactical , operational , and strategic advantage .
What does a flexible military platform mean ?
Due to budget constraints , we are going to see a much greater reliance on civilian hardware , software , and standards of interconnectivity .
To prevent chaos from the influx of off the shelf hardware and software , the military will need to develop platforms that enable all of this externally derived hardware / software to interconnect and act synergistically .
Further , with this platform in place , these technologies can be rapidly and inexpensively stitched together through ad hoc systems design to precisely meets the needs of the emerging situation to generate success .
Here 's an example of ad hoc systems design .
Let 's say there 's a perceived need by a deployed unit to track interactions with local militias ( dozens are operating in its area ) .
Rather than wait years for a centralized solution , the unit builds a simple Web application that operates in a way similar to a civilian sales tracking application ( in fact , many of the components used are from the civilian sector ) .
This new system is quick to deploy and it allows the unit to capture data on every interaction with militia members and track progress .
If the system used simple Internet standards for data sharing , the system can be updated , connected , extended , and shared very easily .
In an age of scarcity , that 's the approach we have to take .
President - elect Barack Obama will nominate Colorado Senator Ken Salazar as the next Secretary of the Department of the Interior , three anonymous Democratic sources have confirmed .
The sources say that Salazar has been offered the job , one telling the Rocky Mountain News “ It ’s a done deal . ”
Salazar , a Democrat , is four years into his first term as U.S. Senator from Colorado and has been a vocal critic of the Bush administration ’s energy and environmental policies , especially those relating to oil and gas development in the American West .
When current Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne announced the draft rule designed to accelerate oil shale development across the West , Salazar reacted strongly , saying :
“ The administration is trying to set the stage for a last - minute fire sale of commercial oil - shale leases in western Colorado , despite the fact that we are still years away from knowing if the technologies for developing oil shale on a commercial scale are even viable . ”
[ social_buttons ]
Salazar ’s knowledge and experience with public lands and water policy stretch back to his thirty years as a farmer and the eleven he spent practicing environmental and water law in a private practice .
And that familiarity with water politics was no more evident than when he called out John McCain back in August , saying the Arizona senator ’s remark about wanting to renegotiate the Colorado River Compact was “ dangerously naive . ”
“ I think Salazar will probably revisit the multiple use doctrine for the management of our public lands , ” said Colorado State University political scientist Andy Kear , via telephone .
Kear , an expert on energy and public lands policy in the American West , said that Salazar would likely strike a more balanced approach in terms of recognizing energy , recreation , and ranching values .
Instead of promoting the “ Drill , baby , drill ” mantra of resource depletion , Kear said Salazar ’s motto might be closer to , “ Ranch , recreate , and then think about drilling . ”
Salazar ’s support for clean energy has also been well established .
Renewable energy advocates are well aware of Salazar ’s work to help pass extensions of the renewable energy production and investment tax credits ; as well as his his leadership in getting the small - wind tax credit passed and signed into law .
But Salazar ’s mission will not be easy .
The Colorado Senator will be charged with taking over a department not only saddled with a raft of last - minute Bush administration regulatory changes vigorously opposed by environmental groups , but also one with deep - seeded and intractable political battles and recent scandals that caught Interior Department employees and oil companies engaging in concerted illicit and corrupt behavior .
In announcing the other members of his environmental team today , Obama hinted that his choice for Interior Secretary would be soon to follow , but few would have guessed it to be this soon .
The official announcement from Obama is likely to come some time later this week , but possible replacements are already being discussed to fill the open Senate seat .
Some of those names include Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper , outgoing Speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives , Andrew Romanoff , and Salazar ’s younger brother , U.S. Representative John Salazar .

Dec. 19 , 2008  --
In the early 1960s , Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram shocked America when he demonstrated that ordinary people will commit acts of violence that conflict with their personal conscience and moral convictions if instructed to do so by an authority figure .
Now , a replication of that famous experiment is uncovering some of the same findings and controversy .
In the original experiment , Milgram asked ordinary people to administer painful -- and in some cases , even fatal -- shocks to other people posing as research subjects .
The maximum voltage they could administer was 450 volts -- enough to cause permanent damage or even death to the study subject .
In reality , the " research subjects " were not receiving any shock .
But the act of inflicting harm on another individual was still very much real to the people administering the voltage .
Although many of the participants that were asked to administer shocks expressed hesitation or even gently refused to continue going on with the experiment , Milgram found that about two - thirds of all the participants completed the study and administered the full 450 volts of shock .
Jerry Burger , lead investigator of the new study and a professor of psychology at Santa Clara University , said that his modified version of the study came to a similar conclusion : About 70 percent of the participants continued administering shock until they reached the highest voltage point .
But because the participants administering the voltage were deceived into believing that they were really shocking the study subjects , some ethics experts say the research goes too far .
" I feel quite strongly that this research study does not meet ethical research standards , " said Dr. Michael Grodin , professor of bioethics , human rights , philosophy and psychiatry at the Boston University School of Public Health .
" This is still deception research where the subject is not told that deception will be used . "
Conforming to New Ethical Standards
Still , few would argue that the researchers in the most recent study paid far more attention to the ethical pitfalls of this research , compared to the one conducted more than 40 years ago .
Milgram 's experiment took place before many of the formal guidelines for professional conduct and institutional review boards , or IRBs , had been established .
In fact , many say the concern over the emotional state of the participants in this study was a significant factor behind the development of ethical standards for human experimentation .
In light of this , Burger was initially unsure whether he would even be able to conduct a similar experiment .
His team took a number of steps to ensure that the replication of Milgram 's experiment conformed to current ethical standards .
" The most important difference [ from Milgram 's experiment ] was that we stopped the procedure much earlier , only asking participants to go up to the 150 - volt point , " Burger said .
Additionally , he said they " screened participants for ethical concerns because we did n't want them to have a very negative response to this . "
Dr. Jeffrey Spike , associate professor of medical humanities and social sciences at the Florida State University College of Medicine , said he believed these steps were " an acceptable compromise " in solving the ethical problem of causing the study participants emotional duress .
Still , a healthy ethical debate rages on over whether it is acceptable to use such forms of deception , possibly causing psychological distress , to reach a scientific conclusion .
But Spike noted that considering what was learned from both Milgram and Burger 's experiments about the human tendency to obey figures of authority -- even at some rather extreme costs -- the use of deception is justified .
" Stanley Milgram 's experiments are among the most important in the history of experimental psychology , if not the most important , " Spike said .
" They are true classics , and help to explain phenomenon we read with shock and disbelief in the paper every day . "
" We have to look at it like that and get a result in the meantime .
We did lose the confidence in the fans but , in the last four games , the performances and the results have encouraged them .
GOP pollster : ' I cannot foresee ' scenario where McCain wins David Edwards and Andrew McLemore

It does n't look good for Sen. John McCain .
Both campaigns have pushed polls that show their candidate in a position to win the presidential race , but a Republican pollster said it is highly unlikely McCain will triumph on Tuesday .
" I cannot foresee a scenario that John McCain is elected the President of the United States , " pollster Frank Luntz said .
Luntz said the economic crisis was the downfall of McCain 's campaign , which enjoyed a 10 - day lead over Sen. Barack Obama that " collapsed " with the stock market in mid-September .
McCain told voters he can guarantee a win in the election , though it will be a close race , Radio Australia reported .
But polls show McCain continues to trail behind Obama in key states like Ohio .
" We are very competitive in those areas and we 're going to have to just get out our vote and work very hard over the next nine days , " McCain said .
Supporters of the GOP hopeful tend to agree with his disregard for the pre-election predictions based on the polls , Reuters reported .
" I do n't care about the polls .
I think they 're designed to affect people 's emotions , " said photographer Jan Ogle .
But a confident Obama asked voters to be his " ambassadors " and " close the deal , " CNN reported .
" In these last three days , we can't afford to slow down or sit back or let up ... not now , not when there 's so much at stake , " Obama said at a late rally in Springfield , Missouri , his third stop on Saturday .

From Tianya , October 14th 2008 :
Yesterday , someone reported that a pupil at the Binhe Road Primary School in Dengfeng City [ in Henan province ] has been standing outside the classroom to listen to lessons for over 20 days , suspecting that the teacher was punishing the student .
Yesterday afternoon at 2 pm , a reporter rushed to Binhe Road Primary School .
After hearing the class bell ring , the students entered the classroom one by one .
However , under the classroom window for Class 1 - 3 , a little girl carrying a backpack said goodbye to the schoolmates who talk to her .
She grabbed the steel bar of the window with both hands and looked into the classroom uninterrupted .
After reporter ’s inquiry , the little girl is called Guo Xiaoxiao ( name changed ) , from Wangzhuang Village nearby / of Dengfeng City , and 6 - years - old this year .
She used to attend class in this room but , for reasons unknown , she was kicked out of class .
Not wanting to leave the school and still wanting to study , she could only stand under the window to listen to the lessons .
When Xiaoxiao ’s father Guo Zhanchao arrived shortly later , seeing his daughter standing outside the window listening to class , he was unable to hold back his sobs .
He told the reporter that he pedals three - wheel carts ( carrying goods ) for a living .
Originally , he knew the Binhe Road School Headmaster Zhao .
At the start of the school year , unable to find a school that would admit his child , he borrowed and gathered 500 RMB and gave it to Headmaster Zhao .
Mr Zhao immediately agreed to admit Guo Xiaoxiao to the school , but later Mr Zhao delayed and delayed until the afternoon of September 10th when Mr Guo ’s daughter was finally assigned to Class 1 - 3 .
But good things do not last ; on September 18th , the daughter who had been attending school for only a few days said to her father while crying that the teacher would no longer let her into class , and that she could only stand outside the window to listen to lessons .
Soon after , Guo Zhanchao went almost daily to the school to see the headmaster , but Headmaster Zhao only agreed to return the money and did not plan on arranging Guo Xiaoxiao to attend school .
Guo Zhanchao said with tears , “ I suffered my whole life because I do n’t have an education , and today can only depend on pedaling a three - wheel cart to raise my family with difficulty .
I just want my daughter to learn some knowledge , so she can have a happy life later . ”
Mr Zhao , headmaster of Binhe Road Primary School , commented on the incident saying that he is unfairly blamed .
He said Guo Zhanchao and him knew each other from before , that he did indeed receive the 500 RMB money that Guo forcefully left in his office , but he later returned the money to Guo .
Regarding letting Guo Xiaoxiao ’s attend school , he can only feel sorry for their family ’s situation , but could not arrange for her to attend school simply because they gave him a gift .
Later , he could not do anything against the exclusion of Xiaoxiao .
“ That was handled in accordance to the relevant regulations of the Department of Education .
She is the child of a peasant who migrated to the city for work , not a pupil of this area . ”
Comments on Sina :
Everyone has their own duty .
The duty of a farmer is to cultivate the fields , his daughter should research how to cultivate fields .
Studying is for us city dwellers , hehe .
I cried … I can’t handle seeing little children , especially little girls , suffering the most …
Seeing the girl stand by the window looking inside .
it was unbearable .
Do you believe that I dare smash this kind of school ?!
If you let one of her in today , tomorrow there might be 10 who come .
City dwellers basically now all only have one child , but rural people all have 3 or 5 .
One husband and wife pair from the city occupies one seat in a classroom , but a rural husband and wife pair would occupy 3 - 5 seats in a classroom .
I ask you , do you think this is fair and rational ?
Old Mao utilised the farmers ’ power to conquer everything under the sky [ in this context : China ] .
He owes the farmers the most , because he separated people into different classes .
This policy continues to this day without reform .
[ referring to the hukou system ]
Do not carelessly be sympathetic .
She should go to school in the place she is supposed to go to .
School is not a homeless shelter .
Peasants , peasants .
Pity the lowest class of people !
The child is worth our sympathy .
But how come the countryside ’s other children are not standing outside the windows to listen to class , is all because of their parents .
Do you have a method of contact ?
I will pay to let the child go to school !
TMD , what kind of society is this !!!!
Whether or not she can go to school is not the key , the key is why kick the little girl out after letting her go to school for a period of time ?
and then kick her out ?
There is some story inside here , was it because they gave too little money !!!
Is anyone thinking the same thing ?
I did not have to read the content , just looking at the pictures , my tears started running down .
I ask the school headmaster and the teachers :
Do you even see the girl standing outside the door ?
Regardless in which city in China , migrant workers are always the lowest class , the most bullied people .
There is [ officially ] no tuition fee nationwide , but I still have to pay 500 - 600 RMB a semester for my child to go to school in Puning City [ in Jieyang , Guangdong province ] .
Migrant workers just suffer bullying .
This kind of teacher should have been expelled from the teaching corps long ago .
This little girl is so sad .
Bastard teachers , if she were your child , how would you feel ?
First figure out whether the local department of education really has this kind of regulation .
If it really does , then find out whether there are schools admitting children of migrant workers .
This society does not pity tears .
Asking for help is not as good as helping yourself .
The only thing that is a bigger failure than the Chinese football [ soccer ] team is the Chinese education system .
What is it that makes those who have received educations have such cold hearts ?
Nobody said peasants are bad .
Peasants can stay home and plant fields .
Why do they want to come to the cities to be migrant workers ?
All she needs to do to go to school is go home , no one is stripping her of her right to an education .
The reason she cannot go to school is entirely a result of her parents coming to work in the city for their own personal benefits .
Comments on Mop :
I always thought compulsory education was real … [ I was ] “ very foolish , very naive “ …
The people suffering the most in China are actually not the migrant workers ,
but their children .
This damn system system of China ’s …sigh , there is nothing left for me to say …
Beginning from when we are small , we have heard , seen , and been told that socialism is good .
But after growing up , we have no idea where socialism is good !!
In China , the education system has never been fair and just , there is not much reason to be so angry .
Just live numbly in this country .
Talk about human rights are all lies .
Americans say we do n’t have human rights .
Do we still need to refute it ?
People always say that the foreigners look down on us Chinese , but now even Chinese look down on their own people , so how can others respect us ?
If it were me , standing outside like that while the other students were inside attending class , I do not know how I would feel .
Such a little child , and letting her suffer how unfair this society is , it is too pitiful .
Comments on Tianya :
What were the parents thinking ?
Why did they bring her into this world , to let her suffer , and her young soul suffer mutilation .
Seeing the child ’s longing , I ca n’t stop the tears from flowing down my face .
What kind of society is this , that would let such little child suffer such unfairness and discrimination ?
Where is the “ harmony ? ” [ China ’s government repeatedly emphasizes a “ harmonious ” society for China . ]
It reminds me of the phrase “ Chinese and dogs are not allowed to enter ! ”
I do n’t know whether I am qualified to talk about education here .
I am not an expert , I am just a normal student at a no - name university , so my view on education may not be mature .
It may even be extreme , so please do n’t laugh at me , and if I am wrong , I hope everyone can be tolerant .
When we were in primary school , teacher told the students to keep their hands behind their back , their heads held high , and their chest out .
We did a we were told and listened to the teacher .
Not making mistakes was what makes a good child , so whatever the teacher said , that is what we did ; whatever the teacher taught , that is what we learned .
If our grades were not bad , and if we tested into a good junior high or a good high school , then we would be deeply grateful to the teacher .
When I got to university , in the midst of different events and activities , I finally realised I did not know how to do anything , that I had to think on my own , and it was very difficult to have my own ideas .
It was then that I realized that we have already lost our creativity .
Who should be blamed ?
I think the teachers are innocent , and the blame lies on the whole society ’s education system .
Look at our graduating students .
All of them are the same , there is no personality .
When I say personality is not about dressing fashionably or or behaving weird , but about the ways they think about problems , a type of attitude about life .
Today ’s students are all premature , their way of handling things appears to be smooth and mature .
In reality , it is not , because these were all copied from others and not what they came to understand themselves .
This can also be called education and learning with Chinese characteristics .
Everyone says China is a strong manufacturing country , but it is not strong country in research and development .
I think it is definitely not a problem of technology , but to a great extent it is because our education methods have imprisoned our thinking , and restricted our development .
What we students are most skilled at is not thinking but learning , learning other people ’s methods .
Normally when we are working , we wait for other people to teach , and then become like masters after we have learned .
I think China will never become strong relying on these methods .
Maybe what I say is not all fair and sound , but the actual situation is basically like that .
Someone said that one ’s thinking determines one ’s life , that is to say , whatever level of thinking you reach will determine what your life will be like .
I really approve of this kind of of saying .
Indeed , the type of education a person , a society , and a country receives will directly relate to that country ’s rise and fall , success and failure .
Now that society has become like this , who should we blame ?
The people ’s living standard has risen somewhat , but whose standard has risen the most ?
While we have gained something on the materialistic level , have we not also lost something at the same time ?
These things , who should we blame ?
What would you do ?
Do you let this one girl go to this school or should the rules be followed because there are reasons for the rules ?

decodes a plain string ( ie , bytes in some encoding ) to a Unicode string .
. encode ( ) encodes a Unicode string into a plain string .
Feeding a plain string to the unicode ( ) constructor is the same as calling . decode ( ) on the string .
Things get weird if you call .encode ( ) or .decode ( ) on the ' wrong ' type of thing .
Calling .decode ( ) on a Unicode string appears to first encode the Unicode string to a plain string , using Python 's default locale , and then call . decode ( ) on the result .
Calling .encode ( ) on a plain string attempts to decode the string to Unicode , using Python 's default locale again , and then calls .encode ( ) on the result .
( Feeding a Unicode string to the unicode ( ) constructor is not the same thing as calling . decode ( ) on the Unicode string ; instead it is a no - op if you do not supply an encoding and an error if you do . )
This assumes that you are not using one of the special - purpose codecs like base64 .
Things like base64 will happily map straight from plain strings to their encoding , even if the plain string cannot be decoded to Unicode in the default locale .
Special purpose codecs generally will only encode things that are in their decoding output format ; calling them on the wrong thing will at the best cause a conversion to the other sort of string first ( eg , using base64 on a Unicode string ) , complete with possible encoding errors , and at the worst will die with an internal error ( eg , using idna on a plain string ) .
If Google delivers useless search results , just erase them and you wo n't see them again .
That 's possible under a new system Google have launched today .
Hoping to give its search engine a more personal touch , Google now lets users reshuffle results so their favourite websites get top billing and disliked destinations get discarded the next time they enter the same request .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It marks the first time that the internet 's most popular search engine has allowed its audience to alter the order of search results .
Although the revisions wo n't affect Google 's closely guarded formulas for ranking websites , the Mountain View - based company is n't ruling out eventually tapping into collective wisdom of the crowds to tweak its internet - searching algorithms .
For now , Google simply wants to make specific sets of results more useful to each individual that comes to its search engine , said Marissa Mayer , who oversees the company 's search products .
Users will have to have a personal login to take advantage of the editing feature .
" It should make the search results more dynamic , " she said .
The decision to let people tinker with their results is a tacit acknowledgment that not even Google 's seemingly omniscient search engine can possibly divine which websites will appeal to specific users .
It also underscores how frequently people use Google to search for the same thing , such as " San Francisco hotels , " over and over again .
Google 's search recipe relies so heavily on automated ingredients that a variety of startup rivals such as Mahalo , Hakia and ChaCha have tried to carve out a new niche by relying on humans to vet and point to results .
But none of those have made a dent in a market that is increasingly controlled by Google , which processes more than 60 per cent of the search requests made around the world .
Here 's how the new system , called SearchWiki , works .
If you 're logged into Google when doing a search , you 'll get results with a series of buttons below the links .
Clicking on arrow pointing upward moves a result higher on the results page .
That link will come back in that new spot the next time you search on the same term .
Clicking on an " X " will delete the link so it does n't appear the next time you make the same search .
Users will also be able to open a box to make notes about different sites so they can be read again in the future .
The comments also will be shared with others who are logged in , if they click on a link for " See all notes for this SearchWiki . "

A recapitulation of criticism against the theory of childhood
The theory of childhood , also known as child origin , is a damnable , loathsome and indefensible lie .
How can any thinking person suppose all humans used to be babies once ?
Just consider these arguments :
There is no development path from babies to adults , no transitional forms between these two species .
Show me even one baby with the head of a grown man on his body .
Can you ?
No ?
Not even a bearded toddler ?
No adults with unfused skullbones , outside unfortunate disorders ?
Not even a tiny little newborn girl suddenly sprouting a respectable bosom ?
You can't find them , because they do n't exist .
There is n't a single transitional form between children and adults , and you will never find one because the theory simply is an unscientific lie .
The development of children has been well - researched in our six - month study following a sample of one thousand children and adults of various ages .
We have conclusively proven that while there are minor changes in features like height and body fat , and replacement of deciduous teeth with permanent teeth , incontravertibly still every creature in the study that started out as a child had only slightly more adult features at the end of the observation period than at its beginning .
Children and adults are separate kinds and there will never be sufficient changes to change one into the other .
We reject any evidence from longer - term studies as we believe the laws of physics have changed within the last year .
To claim people come from children is demeaning and morally degrading .
We have observed how children behave .
If we acted like small children we'd all be demanding and impatient , and we'd be cheating , lying , and stealing from each other all the time .
If the theory of childhood were true there would be no morality , and with no morality to build one on , no society .
Childhood is a wicked lie used by charlatans to justify evils such as public schools .
There is no consensus on the theory of childhood in the scientific community .
We should teach the controversy .
Our children will be served well to learn that the prospect of them becoming adults is merely a theoretical idea .
Many children come from families that do not subscribe to the theory of childhood , and they could be disturbed if the theory were taught as fact .
A trio of bad apples from Arizona , including a DARE officer with a penchant for sexual assault , made the news this week , while the city of Berwyn , Illinois , found itself in a bit of hot water over the way it used asset forfeiture funds .
Let 's get to it :
In Nogales , Arizona , a former Nogales DARE officer was convicted last Friday on numerous charges related to unwanted sexual contact with young women .
Ramon Borbon , 40 , was convicted of sexual abuse and obstructing a criminal investigation in the case of a 16 - year - old girl whom he forced to touch him inappropriately and threatened to stop her from going to authorities .
He was also convicted of sexual assault and kidnapping charges in the case of a 19 - year - old woman for restraining and raping her .
He was in uniform during both incidents .
In a motion ruling during trial , Santa Cruz County Superior Court Judge James Soto wrote that Borbon has " a character trait which gives rise to an aberrant sexual propensity " and that he appeared to have " identified young , vulnerable females with a history of psychological and / or substance abuse problems that are less likely to come forward and if they do , are less likely to be considered credible . "
There are also at least four other complaints of sexual abuse against Borbon .
The police department had earlier found them to be " without merit . "
He will be sentenced December 12 .
In Phoenix , a Maricopa County jail guard was arrested Monday for allegedly smuggling cocaine in for an inmate .
Detention officer Ryan
White , 27 , accepted sexual favors from two women who were the inmates ' roommates in return for sneaking in the coke , which was found in his uniform pocket .
He is now charged with two felonies -- promoting jail contraband and assisting in a criminal syndicate .
In Coolidge , Arizona , a guard at the Corrections Corporation of America 's Central Arizona Detention Center was arrested last week by the FBI on charges he tried to smuggle cocaine into the prison there .
Juan Nunez is charged with attempted provision of a prohibited object to an inmate and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute .
According to the criminal complaint in the case , Nunez had been negotiating for the past two weeks with an inmate 's family to bring cocaine into the prison .
On November 6 , Nunez met with an FBI agent possessing as an outside source for cocaine and accepted a half - ounce of cocaine and $ 1,600 for agreeing to smuggle it into the private prison .
He was arrested after that meeting .
A conviction for trying to bring a prohibited object to an inmate in this case carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in federal prison , a $ 250,000 fine or both , and a conviction for possession of cocaine for sale carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in federal prison , a $ 1 million fine or both .
In Berwyn , Illinois , the US Justice Department has accused the city of Berwyn of misusing drug forfeiture money .
After reviewing the city 's annual audit of asset forfeiture spending , the department 's Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section sent the city a letter citing various " impermissible expenditures , " including spending too much of the asset forfeiture fund in the years 2004 and 2005 .
Since asset forfeiture funds are generally supposed to be used for crime prevention , the department cited more than $ 120,000 used to pay salaries , $ 88,000 in " cash transfers " to the Berwyn Park District , $ 156,000 in " cash transfers " to two local school districts , and $ 91,000 for bus trip for senior citizens .
In all , the city may have to pay back more than $ 760,000 in improperly disbursed asset forfeiture funds .
While schools , parks , and senior citizen bus rides are all worthy activities , spending asset forfeiture funds on them is a violation of the law .

" During the second kingdom we thought it was an area everybody bypassed .
But finding the pyramid meant it was a real power - base .
This was not a backwater , it was partaking in the major trade routes in the world . "
A 30 - year - old Spanish woman has made medical history by becoming the first patient to receive a whole organ transplant grown using her own cells .
Experts said the development opened a new era in surgery in which the repair of worn - out body parts would be carried out with personally customised replacements .
Claudia Castillo , who lives in Barcelona , underwent the operation to replace her windpipe after tuberculosis had left her with a collapsed lung and unable to breathe .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The bioengineered organ was transplanted into her chest last June at the Hospital Clinic in Barcelona .
Four months later she was able to climb two flights of stairs , go dancing and look after her children – activities that had been impossible before the surgery .
Ms Castillo has also crossed a second medical frontier by becoming the first person to receive a whole organ transplant without the need for powerful immunosuppressant drugs .
Doctors overcame the problem of rejection by taking her own stem cells to grow the replacement organ , using a donor trachea ( lower windpipe ) to provide the mechanical framework .
Blood tests have shown no sign of rejection months after the surgery was complete .
Speaking at a press conference in London yesterday , called to announce the results , Professor Martin Birchall , an ear , nose and throat surgeon from the University of Bristol who collaborated on the case , said : " This is just the beginning .
I think it will completely transform the way we think about surgery .
" In 20 years ' time the commonest surgical operations will be regenerative procedures to replace organs and tissues damaged by disease with autologous [ self - grown ] tissues and organs from the laboratory .
We are on the verge of a new age in surgical care . "
Professor Birchall said the technique could initially be extended to growing other hollow organs such as the bowel , bladder and reproductive tract but could later be extended to solid organs including the heart , liver and kidneys .
" They have all got scaffolds [ natural frameworks ] on which new cells can be grown , " he said .
" We will need units next to hospitals to generate the cells .
The trick is turning it into a therapy for thousands of patients – [ the process ] will have to be automated . "
Four teams of researchers collaborated on the case led by Professor Paolo Macchiarini of the Hospital Clinic and involving academic centres in Spain , Italy and the UK .
The results are published today in the online edition of The Lancet .
Professor Macchiarini said : " Claudia was unable to play with her children , work or perform her normal social duties .
Now she is able to do that [ after the transplant ] .
It was and is the most beautiful gift we can perform in our career . "
Two further patients , from Germany and the United States , are in hospital in Barcelona , awaiting transplants of their windpipes , which had been damaged by cancer , he said .
It would take two to three months to grow the replacement organs and " put them in good shape " before operating , he added .
The surgery could be suitable for up to 3,000 patients similarly affected by damaged trachea and bronchus ( the lower part of the windpipe ) in Europe , and tens of thousands if it were extended to include the larynx ( the upper part ) , researchers said .
The operation takes transplant surgery a step closer to the goal of replacing damaged or worn - out organs with functioning replacements that are not rejected by the body , which are in increasing demand as life expectancy grows .
Conventional transplant surgery involving the transfer of organs from dead donors means the living recipients have to spend the rest of their lives on powerful drugs to suppress their immune systems , putting them at risk from infections and diseases such as cancer .
Two years ago , doctors in the US claimed a world first after transplanting seven patients with bladders grown in the laboratory .
Yesterday , British researchers involved in the new case said that development had been a " major advance " which had " paved the way " for the new technique .
But they said the bladder transplant had been of a " cellular patch " of tissue , not a whole organ .
The new technique of customising organs so that they are indistinguishable from the body 's own tissues not only overcomes the problem of rejection but also greatly extends the range of organs and tissues that can be transplanted .
Only one attempt had been made previously to transplant a windpipe – by surgeons in Ohio in 1998 – and the operation had not been repeated because the immune response had been too severe , requiring very heavy doses of immunosuppressant drugs .
Transplant of other body parts , such as limbs , had been restricted by concerns over immunosuppression .
Professor Anthony Hollander , of the University of Bristol , said the advance had been achieved as a result of developments in stem - cell technology .
" For stem - cell science , this is really exciting , " he said .
" Without stem cells this procedure would not have been possible . "
Der weltweite Markt rund um die digitale Fotografie soll bis ins Jahr 2013 jährlich 8.3 % wachsen .
Unterschieden werden in der Studie des amerikanischen Marktforschers BCC Research die beiden Bereiche Produkte und Anwendungen , wobei der zweite deutlich stärker zulegen soll .
Der globale Markt für Technologien rund um die Digitalfotografie beträgt im laufenden Jahr ca. 155 Milliarden US - Dollar ( gemäss BCC Research ) .
Im Jahr 2007 umfasste dieser 136.7 Milliarden und bis ins Jahr 2013 wird ein beachtliches Marktvolumen von ca. 230 Milliarden US - Dollar erwartet .
BCC unterscheidet in seiner Studie zwei Marktbereiche : Digitale Produkte und Digitale Anwendungen .
Der Bereich der digitalen Produkte umfasst Digitalkameras , Objektive , Produkte zur Bildverarbeitung , Drucker , Kamerasensoren , Mobiltelefon - Kameras und Produkte zur Aufbewahrung von Bilddaten .
Der Produkt - Bereich macht zurzeit den grösseren Teil des Marktes aus und beträgt im Jahr 2008 ca. 101.3 Milliarden US - Dollar .
BCC erwartet bis 2013 ein jährliches Wachstum von 5.2 % auf 130.6 Milliarden US - Dollar .
Zum Bereich der digitalen Fotografie - Anwendungen zählt BCC die professionelle Fototrafie , traditionelle Stock - Fotografie , Microstock - Fotografie , Fotografie - Software , Foto - Verarbeitung , Fotobücher , Sicherheits - Anwendungen sowie automatisierte und medizinische Anwendungen .

Family violence ( FV ) , apparently one of the greatest concerns in our society ;
Is it worthy of the attention it gets ?
The media think so .
Many politicians think so and so do the people making their living from the women 's shelter movement .
Senator Anne C. Cools is concerned about it too , but for reasons that may surprise many .

Restless sleep may be a bad sign in some people Physically " acting out " dreams when asleep could be an early warning sign of dementia or Parkinson 's disease .
Canadian researchers studied 93 people with " REM sleep behaviour disorder " , which can involve punching or kicking out while dreaming .
The Neurology study found more than a quarter were diagnosed with a degenerative brain condition over the next five years .
UK experts said the research could help doctors predict the condition .
Normally , during " Rapid Eye Movement " , or " REM " sleep , our muscles relax and do not move , but people with certain sleep disorders are able to lash out , or cry out .
It is a known symptom of some kinds of brain disease , including Parkinson 's disease , and a rare form of dementia called Lewy body dementia .
This important finding could boost our understanding of how Lewy body dementia develops and help us detect it early
Dr Susanne Sorensen
Alzheimer 's Society
The exact reason for the link is unclear , although some have suggested that subtle damage to a part of the brain which regulates sleep may be responsible .
However , in some cases , the problem happens long before the onset of the main symptoms of these diseases , and doctors at Montreal General Hospital wanted to see whether apparently otherwise healthy people with the problem were at higher risk .
Their study volunteers were all elderly - on average 65 years old - which already put them at higher risk of developing dementia or Parkinson 's compared with a younger person .
However , each was followed on average for five years , and in that period , 26 of the 93 developed a degenerative brain disease .
In total , 14 were diagnosed with Parkinson 's disease , seven with Lewy body dementia , four with Alzheimer 's Disease , and another diagnosed with a disorder called multiple system atrophy , which involves both Parkinson 's and dementia symptoms .
High chance
Their predictions suggested that patients of this age with the same sleep disorder would have a greater than 50/50 chance of falling prey to a similar condition over the following 12 years .
The researchers said that knowing more about the risks faced by people with the sleep disorder could not only help doctors to advise their patients , but also to work in the years to come to come up with ways to protect them .
Dr Susanne Sorensen , head of research at the Alzheimer 's Society , said that the findings were particularly interesting in relation to Lewy body dementia , which accounts for only 4 % of dementia cases .
The researchers had said that even the four Alzheimer 's cases might turn out to be Lewy body dementia as the disease progressed .
Dr Sorensen said : " People with Lewy body dementia often have vivid nightmares , restless sleep and hallucinations - this study suggests that people with the disease may experience sleep disorders years before their other symptoms develop .
" This important finding could boost our understanding of how Lewy body dementia develops and help us detect it early .
With further research we may be able to stop this devastating disease in its tracks . "

SIR HENRY TATE'S MAUSOLEUM IMMORTALISED IN SUGAR CUBES
As creator of sugar cubes in the UK , Sir Henry Tate ( 1819 - 1899 ) made his fortune in the sugar trade and was one of the most significant art collectors of the Victorian era .
In 1897 he bequeathed his vast art collection to the nation and poured £ 100,000 in to the building of the very first Tate Gallery .
Therefore the sugar trade and art have enjoyed a symbiotic relationship since the 19th century .
Now four
Tate museums exist across the UK and attract a global audience , with Tate Modern receiving the most visitors of any contemporary art museum in the world .

I ’m planning to cover all of what Django can do , but for now , let ’s start simple with something most Django developers spend way too much time creating : Custom tags .
Django ’s nice enough to provide a @register .
simple_tag decorator for creating very basic tags that do n’t take a context but do take parameters .
This is great , but what if you want more ?
Many Django applications use the same boilerplate time and time again to create their tags , but we make it much easier .
Introducing @basictag and @blocktag .
@basictag
Ever wanted to use Django ’s @register .
simple_tag but needed access to the context ?
I ’ve found far too many cases where this would be useful , but Django does n’t make this easy .
Your tag code would end up looking like this :
class MyTagNode( template .
Node ) : def __init__( self , arg1 , arg2 ) : self.arg1 = arg1 self .arg2 = arg2 def render ( self , context ) : arg1 = Variable( self.arg1).resolve(context ) arg2 = Variable( self.arg2).resolve( context ) return context [ ' user ' ] @register.tag def mytag ( parser , token ) : bits = token.split_contents ( ) return MyTagNode ( bits [ 1 ] , bits [ 2 ] )
Do this a few times and it ’s bound to drive you nuts .
How about this instead ?
from djblets.util.decorators import basictag @register.tag @basictag( takes_context=True ) def mytag ( context , arg1 , arg2 ) : return context [ ' user ' ]
Far less code and increased readability .
Hooray !
@blocktag
@blocktag aims to do the same thing @basictag does but for block tags .
A block tag is a tag that contains nested content , like @spaceless or @for .
This usually requires even more boilerplate than the above code fragment , except with the added complexity of having to grab the contents of the block .
We ’ve condensed it down to this :
from djblets.util.decorators import blocktag @register.tag @blocktag def blinkblock ( context , nodelist , arg1 , arg2 ) : return " < blink > %s </ blink > " % nodelist.render( context )
If you ’ve built block tags in the past , you ’ll appreciate how simple that was .

In what seems to be a follow - up to yesterday ’s kerfuffle about Barack Obama ’s comments about the Warren Court and redistribution of wealth , there ’s now an audio clip of him from the same radio program discussing what he called a “ fundamental flaw ” in the Constitution :
I think it ’s a remarkable document …
The original Constitution as well as the Civil War Amendments … but I think it is an imperfect document , and I think it is a document that reflects some deep flaws in American culture , the Colonial culture nascent at that time .
African - Americans were not — first of all they were n’t African - Americans — the Africans at the time were not considered as part of the polity that was of concern to the Framers .
I think that as Richard said it was a ‘ nagging problem ’ in the same way that these days we might think of environmental issues , or some other problem where you have to balance cost - benefits , as opposed to seeing it as a moral problem involving persons of moral worth .
And in that sense , I think we can say that the Constitution reflected an enormous blind spot in this culture that carries on until this day , and that the Framers had that same blind spot .
I do n’t think the two views are contradictory , to say that it was a remarkable political document that paved the way for where we are now , and to say that it also reflected the fundamental flaw of this country that continues to this day .
Obama was referring , quite obviously , to those provisions of the Constitution that not only protected slavery , but enshrined it .
First , there ’s the infamous 3/5 th ’s clause in Article I , Section 2 :
Representatives and direct
Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union , according to their respective Numbers , which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons , including those bound to Service for a Term of Years , and excluding Indians not taxed , three fifths of all other Persons .
The provision in Article I , Section 9 that prohibited Congress from banning the slave trade before 1808 :
The Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit , shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and eight , but a tax or duty may be imposed on such Importation , not exceeding ten dollars for each Person .
And , the provision in Article IV that required the return of fugitive slaves who managed to escape into non-slave states :
No Person held to Service or Labour in one State , under the Laws thereof , escaping into another , shall , in Consequence of any Law or Regulation therein , be discharged from such Service or Labour , But shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due .
Each of these provisions enshrined and perpetuated an institution that constituted a gross violation of individual and violated the very principles upon which this nation was founded .
It was a stain that ate at the very soul of the country and did n’t get erased until the blood of 600,000 men had been shed .
So , in that sense , < strong > Barack Obama is absolutely right when he says that the Constitution was “ fundamentally flawed . ”
And , you know what ?
It still is .
For example , the Interstate Commerce Clause has been used to do far more than regulate commerce between the states .
The Necessary and Proper Clause has been used to find powers for Congress and the President that exist nowhere in the Constitution .
The Ninth and Tenth Amendments are , thanks largely to the vagueness of their language , largely unenforceable .
Congress ’s monetary powers have been ceded to an unelected Federal Reserve Board .
And do n’t even get me started about the flaws in some of the Amendments .
When Andy Dijak injured his right knee playing tennis , he was n’t surprised that he needed surgery .
“ It swelled up like a balloon , ” said the 50 - year - old West Lake resident .
The real shocker was the price tag : $ 12,000 to $ 15,000 to repair tattered cartilage .
Dijak , a creative director for an entertainment company , has no health insurance , so he started shopping for a deal .
He found it in the northern Mexico city of Monterrey at Christus Muguerza High Specialty Hospital , owned by Dallas - based Christus Health .
Here , the staff treated him more like a big shot than a bargain hunter .
An English - speaking employee picked him up at the airport .
Dijak recuperated in a private hospital room with a flat - screen television and a view of the peaks of the Sierra Madre .
His surgeon recorded the operation on video and gave Dijak a DVD copy for his peace of mind .
Total cost , including airfare : $ 4,500 .

“ I got better care there than I would have in the United States , unless I were a billionaire , ” he said .
Americans have long been willing to leave the country for bargain face - lifts and cut -rate dentistry .
But now the availability of top - notch medical services at low cost is enticing a growing number of U.S. patients to developing nations for more sophisticated procedures .
Most , like Dijak , are obtaining elective surgeries for ailments that are n’t life - threatening .
Increasingly , they are seeking treatment for more serious conditions , including heart maladies and cancer .
Last year , 750,000 Americans traveled abroad for care , according to estimates by the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions , a Washington - based research center that ’s part of the consulting firm Deloitte & Touche .
Other analysts say the numbers are lower .
But hardly anyone disputes that medical care , once a highly local business , is going global like never before .
By 2010 , Deloitte projects , 6 million consumers a year will venture outside the United States for medical treatment .
The idea of jetting off to India for heart surgery might strike some as a radical way to save money .
But proponents say it ’s a logical outgrowth of the globalization that ’s reshaping the industry .

Already , offshore firms handle Americans ’ medical records and read their X - rays .
Top U.S. hospitals such as Johns Hopkins have established outposts abroad .
Rising prosperity in many parts of the developing world is luring foreign - born , U.S. - educated doctors home to practice in modern hospitals catering to increasingly affluent consumers .
Nearly 200 institutions outside the U.S. have been certified by the Joint Commission International , an affiliate of the organization that accredits U.S. hospitals .
Medical travel companies are springing up to link American patients with foreign providers eager to boost their profits .
Add a rapidly aging U.S. population and a shrinking medical safety net , and the notion of Americans looking elsewhere for treatment no longer seems such a stretch .
“ This is going to be one of those things that starts slow and becomes pretty routine 15 years out , ” said Arnold Milstein , chief physician for Mercer Human Resource Consulting .

The fact that 1 in 6 U.S. residents , nearly 46 million people , lack health insurance is well known .
But soaring deductibles and increasing restrictions on coverage are driving even insured consumers to seek alternatives .
Mark Sawko ’s insurer balked at paying to replace a bum knee the 50 - year - old Arizonan injured back in high school .
So he called a Tempe , Ariz . - based medical travel company called MedToGo .
The firm arranged for him to have surgery last year in Puerto Vallarta , Mexico , where he spent $ 13,500 instead of the $ 50,000 quoted by a local orthopedic surgeon .
The owner of a company that makes industrial parts , Sawko competes every day with foreign manufacturers .
He sees the same thing happening in medical care .
“ I think we ’re going to lose a lot of business to these other countries , ” said Sawko , who has returned to playing golf without pain .
“ I ’m American , so I ’d like to keep things here .
But no one was going to make it affordable for me . ”
Advertisement
At present , the vast majority of U.S. medical travelers are cash - paying patients such as Sawko .
But analysts say that ’s changing fast as insurance companies and employers add foreign providers to their networks to slow runaway costs .
In Southern California , insurers Aetna , Blue Shield of California , HealthNet and PacifiCare have developed cross - border programs that allow members to seek treatment in Mexico .
That means cheaper premiums for employers and smaller co-pays and other out - of - pocket expenses for members .
“ A lot of small employers have been priced out of traditional coverage , ” said Jim Arriola , president of Sekure Healthcare Inc. , a Chula Vista , Calif . - based company whose plans cap services at a fixed dollar amount .
“ That same $ 1,000 benefit goes a lot further south of the border than it would in the U.S. ”
Uptime Electronics Inc. , a Whittier - based equipment repair company , recently began offering its 20 employees the option of going abroad for care .
The company has contracted with Planet Hospital , a Calabasas medical travel coordinator that has relationships with providers in 13 countries .

Large self - insured companies are doing the same .
Hannaford Supermarkets , a Maine - based grocery chain , has given its 9,000 insured employees the choice of having knee and hip replacements at National University Hospital in Singapore , where such procedures can cost a third of what they do in the United States .
Hannaford waives all deductibles and covers travel expenses for the patient and a companion .
Other employers are offering workers cash incentives as high as $ 10,000 on top of free medical care and travel .
It ’s not hard to see why .
Heart bypass surgery that can cost more than $ 100,000 in the U.S. is generally less than $ 10,000 in India ’s finest hospitals , whose success rates rival those found in the U.S. and Europe , according to Josef Woodman , author of “ Patients Beyond Borders , ” a popular guide to medical travel .
So if healthcare in other countries is so good , why is it so cheap ?
Experts point to a variety of factors .
Doctors ’ salaries and the cost of living are lower in many countries .
Government - funded healthcare in some nations helps contain costs in private - sector hospitals , which do n’t have to shoulder the unpaid bills of uninsured patients as U.S. hospitals do .
In addition , malpractice insurance is cheaper and litigation awards are significantly smaller in most parts of the world .

That lighter liability burden is one reason hospitals in New Zealand can perform procedures such as hip and knee replacements for less than half the price some U.S. facilities charge .
The Pacific island nation is wooing American patients by promoting its First World living standards and common language .
“ We do n’t have a tort system . . . [ that ’s ] like winning the lottery , ” said Steve Nichols , managing director of Medtral New Zealand , a medical travel company .
“ That reflects in the price . ”
It ’s also something consumers need to bear in mind in the event that something goes wrong .
U.S. patients who believe they have been harmed can sue the foreign doctor or hospital -- but only in that nation ’s courts .
Few people are likely to go through that kind of hassle , especially for a meager award .
Texas resident Maggie Terry is still wearing the bandage from a $ 4,500 tummy tuck she got this spring at a small hospital in northern Mexico .
The incision got severely infected and has yet to heal .
Terry figures she ’ll spend thousands more dollars with a U.S. plastic surgeon to repair damaged tissue .

“ I wish I had never done it , ” the 26 - year - old said of her “ bargain ” surgery .
In Monterrey , officials at Christus know they have a long way to go to overcome Americans ’ concerns about Mexico ’s medical facilities , as well as stereotypes about the culture .
This modern industrial city is home to some of Mexico ’s leading companies and some of its wealthiest entrepreneurs .
Familiar U.S. chains such as Starbucks and Chili ’s abound .
Yet “ Americans ask if we have cows and horses in the streets , ” said Julio Cesar Lopez Dominguez , medical travel sales manager for Christus ’ six Mexican hospitals , known collectively as Grupo Christus Muguerza .
To build consumer confidence , the company has obtained Joint Commission International accreditation for its High Specialty Hospital in Monterrey and has begun the process for its South General Hospital across town .
An English - language website allows visitors to take a virtual tour of its facilities and read testimonials from American clients .
Many come for laparoscopic obesity surgery , which at $ 9,000 is less than half the price charged by some U.S. hospitals .
Advertisement
While Christus ’ medical travel business is still in its infancy -- it treated just 200 international patients last year -- it ’s looking to grow that segment into one - third of its business within a decade .
How American doctors and hospitals respond to foreigners poaching their patients remains to be seen .
Medical travel deprived domestic medical providers of about $ 16 billion in spending in 2007 , according to Deloitte .
That ’s chump change in a $ 2.4 - trillion healthcare system .
Some analysts believe that , at most , medical travel could shave a few percentage points off the overall healthcare tab for a typical self - insured company .
That ’s because a lot of the spending is for routine procedures that will never go offshore .
Still , a few thousand dollars here and there add up to real savings for any company .
Deloitte figures that medical travelers will deprive U.S. providers of $ 373 billion in annual spending within a decade .
Most of that will come from high - margin elective surgeries , which U.S. hospitals depend on for a good share of their profits .
Advertisement
Some are already feeling the pinch .
Planet Hospital founder Rudy Rupak has added a handful of U.S. doctors to his network after they agreed to cut their prices .
“ They ’re savvy enough to realize that if they do n’t get involved now they ’re going to be struggling later , ” he said .
U.S. providers that do n’t wake up deserve to lose the business , said Tom Keesling , president of Raleigh , N.C. - based IndUShealth .
The company arranges medical travel to India for individuals and large , self - insured U.S. firms .
Local hospitals “ have been gouging corporations for years . . . saying , ‘ You do n’t have a choice .
We ’re a monopoly , ’ ” Keesling said .
“ Well , guess what : Now we have global competition for healthcare . ”

A dozen tips before you go
1. Check the foreign hospital ’s accreditations or affiliations .
Look for an institution approved by the Joint Commission International ( www.jointcommissioninternational.org), an affiliate of the Joint Commission , a respected , independent , nonprofit agency that accredits U.S. hospitals .
Affiliations with well - known medical institutes are also a sign of quality .
2. Select a fully integrated hospital over a clinic when possible , preferably one that specializes in international patients .
In the event of an emergency , everything you need will be under one roof .
3 . Ask the hospital for data about quality indicators such as morbidity rate , staph infection rate and nurse - to - patient ratio .
Find out how many procedures of your type have been performed there .
Advertisement
4 . Make sure the doctor treating you is board certified , either in his or her own country or in a country with reputable medical care .
Get the physician ’s resume in advance and request references .
5 . Insist on speaking with your doctor before treatment , just as if you were talking to your family physician at home .
Ask questions until you are completely satisfied .
Record the phone call or have someone other than you listening and taking notes .
6 . Make sure the hospital staff speaks your language .
Quick , clear communication is nonnegotiable .
7 . Think about using a medical travel company .
A good one can save you a lot of time by arranging appointments and telephone consultations , booking travel , helping you obtain passports and visas , transferring your medical records and arranging post - operative care .
Find out whether you or the hospital is paying their fees .
Get a detailed list of what is -- and is not -- included .
Get everything in writing .
Demand references .
If the company does n’t respond promptly to your initial request , move on .
Even if you use a medical travel company , do your own due diligence on the doctors and hospitals the company recommends .
Advertisement
8 . Take a companion with you -- and choose that person carefully .
Your spouse or closest blood relative may not be your best advocate in a foreign country .
9 . Do n’t schedule your trip too tightly , and prepare to extend your stay .
Get help with bill - paying , household chores , child and pet care , even powers of attorney , while you ’re away .
10 . Learn a bit about the country where you ’re going .
It will lessen your culture shock , and the locals will appreciate your interest .
11 . Think hard about whether you want to combine medical treatment with leisure travel .
Getting well should be your priority .
And a vacation can eat up a lot of what you save on medical bills .
Advertisement
12 . Even though price is the main driver for medical travel , do n’t be penny - wise and pound foolish .
Better to hire a top - flight surgeon on the front end than a malpractice lawyer afterward .
Do n’t skimp on lodging .
Post - op recovery is tough enough without spending it in a fleabag motel .
Think about flying first class .

" Of all forms of tyranny , the least attractive and most vulgar is the tyranny of mere wealth , of plutocracy . " – J. Pierpont Morgan
Everybody loves a good conspiracy theory , right ?
So let 's sidle up to the concentration of wealth and take a few sniffs .
If you look at the economy throughout the past couple of decades , you 'll see a pattern .
Say that 20 years ago you got together a group of plutocrats with the goal of making the country a better place for big business .
And let 's say you started by creating a set of ideal outcomes .
What would be on your dream scenario list ?
1 . Find a way to put working - class people in their place , which is to shut up and be grateful to even have a job .
2 . Open new markets for American goods , especially ones where they do not compete with goods from local companies .
3 . Find ways to operate outside of government regulation and lawsuits .
4. Increase consumer spending without increasing wages .
5 . Increase government spending without sparking inflation ( which eats into the value of accumulated wealth ) .
Those five events would create enormous wealth without social uprising or government interference .
So how to get there ?
First , you create a global labor market .
Doing so , you open new markets , such as China and India .
Thus , you have more people to sell to , and , if done properly , lots of low - cost laborers , reducing your labor costs while getting rid of lots of pesky employees and the expensive annoyances they have become accustomed to , like benefits .
Indeed , you accomplish the quadruple - dip of wealth creation  suppress domestic wages , thwart inflation , and add new customers , all while side - stepping labor and environmental laws .
The only drawback to this scenario is that by suppressing wages , people have less money to spend on your products and services .
However , if you could achieve easy credit , you could maintain or increase spending levels .
Further , if you have a nice , costly war , you pump vast amounts of governmental money into the economy .
Take all this together , and you have two or three decades of what used to be called " unconscionable profits . "
You do n't hear that phrase anymore because we as a society have agreed that there is no such thing  it is now a part of our culture that the more you can grab the better .
Period .
Would such a series of coordinated events require a conspiracy ?
No .
Let 's face it , the natural state of affairs in a free - market system is inequality , not equality .
In order to have an income distribution that is becoming more equal would require compassionate effort .
To have diverging income classes requires doing nothing .
And nothing is what we , as a society , have done .
We have conspired to not give a damn .
So that is my conspiracy theory .
That raises the question of how working people can deal with the reality of a global labor market .
Individuals must figure out what businesses have always understood :
The real money goes to those who can get around the pressures of competition , to monopoly power .
You get rich by having exclusive rights or information , like say owing the rights to the dominant software used by computers .
For individuals , this monopoly power is individuality  there is only one George Clooney or one Tiger Woods .
For most people , however , exclusivity is not an option ; the best they can do is have a specialty .
But say you are a trained specialist , like a radiologist , engineer or architect .
You still might find yourself competing globally  for instance , architectural plans for US buildings are being drawn in China .
Thinking globally , you must take into account the geography of competition .
If your work can be done via the Internet , then you are up against the world .
However , if it requires face - to - face meetings , then you have limited competition , perhaps even a bit of monopoly of geography .
In other words , a career comes down to two principles : specialize and localize .
That 's how you conspire to opt out of the global labor market .

The beer industry is often described as immune to economic downturns .
After all , when people get laid off , they want to nurse their sorrows with a cold one , right ?
It turns out that , as the beer industry has gone increasingly upscale , the answer to that question is no longer simple .
In recent years , beer sales have been relatively flat except in one category — craft beers , which are made by small , independent brewers .
Amy Mittelman , author of Brewing Battles : A History of American Beer , says that the heyday for such high - end , specialty beers could soon be over as consumers look to cut costs .
Mittelman spoke to U.S. News about the future — and history — of the American beer industry .
Excerpts :
Over the past several years , why have the more expensive beers taken off while sales of mainstream beer have been flat ?
It has to do with the wider trends in American society .
As you 've seen things become more commoditized , people seek authenticity and realness in those commodities .
You see it with coffee , too .
In general , craft beer is seen as being more locally produced with more of a real face .
It 's not as big and does n't feel like an anonymous corporation .
[ Craft brewers ' ] hallmark is making beer the classic way with no additives .
It harkens back to the early years in America , where there were local breweries and saloons .
Do you think that will continue or reverse if the economy undergoes an extended slowdown ?
It 's hard to say .
We 've been hearing about comparisons between what we 're in now and the Great Depression .
[ Back then ] , one of the first things [ Franklin ] Roosevelt did was legalize beer .
He saw beer as a [ morale ] booster and part of the economic recovery package .
He knew that legalizing the industry would bring jobs and production and rev up the economy .
In bad times , do people seek relatively inexpensive comforts ?
Probably yes .
If times get really bad , they may look for the lowest price points .
But relatively speaking , even expensive beer is n't that expensive .
Is it a myth that people drink more beer when the economy is going badly ?
It depends .
Throughout the 1990s , beer sales were kind of flat because of tax increases .
When economic times are frightening , people do turn to alcohol to help with that , depending on how curtailed people 's spending becomes .
But in general , people do turn to alcohol .
Why do you think beer — mostly in the form of references to " Joe Six - pack " — plays such a big role in political debates ?
That gets at why beer is so central to American culture , going back to the beginning of the beer industry .
In America , it was really centered around working - class life .
The great heyday of the brewing industry , before Prohibition , was in the late 19th century .
Cities all across America would have many brewers and saloons .
Beer was cheap compared with wine or hard spirits , so it became the working - class choice .
. . .
Now , it 's ingrained that regular guys drink beer .
Is that stereotype true — are there lots of " Joe Six - packs " out there ?
I do n't know what [ that term ] means .
It 's silly .
It 's an advertising concept .
It 's not real .
Beer is a very popular product , and by some estimates , more people drink beer than drink milk .
All kinds of people drink beer .
What are the biggest challenges you think the beer industry will face over the next century ?
As a whole , it will be increasing competitiveness and consolidation — who will be able to survive on that global level .
In general , our societies go through swings in personal behavior .
We might put restrictive measures around people 's personal autonomy and pleasure - seeking behavior .
Do you think we could go back to Prohibition ?
The myths and negative impression of Prohibition are a pretty big deterrent , but you might see a bigger emphasis around drunk driving .
College presidents recently spoke out about the drinking age .
You might see greater taxes .
In the past , the government has sought money from " sin taxes " to deal with economic downturns .
Are people price sensitive — do they buy less if taxes go up ?
The end is near again : Valve has unleashed Left 4 Dead for PC and Xbox 360 , summoning yet another zombie apocalypse for beleaguered first - person shooter fans .
Tons of zombies and a creepy atmosphere ?
Check .
Limited supplies and ammunition ?
Check .
But things are quite a bit different here .
Blurring the line between survival horror and cinema – right down to the kitschy movie posters and dynamically generated banter between characters – Left 4 Dead offers a decidedly new style of team - based zombie hunting .
Over the course of four campaigns with five maps each , four survivors must battle seemingly insurmountable odds – with the biggest barrier to success being how well everyone works together .
My first hands - on with the game left me with bitter feelings toward my fellow man – perhaps we deserved this cruel fate after all , if we could n't even move down a hallway without panicking and being ripped to shreds .
But with the game 's Tuesday release , I 've had a change of heart .
While there is an offline , single - player option , chances are you 'll want to take on zombies – or humans , if you 're so inclined – online with friends and strangers .
Left 4
Dead is n't your typical zombie frag - fest , so here are four rather important things to remember while you 're prepping for battle .
1. 4 Heads Are Better Than None
You 've never played a co-op game quite like this one .
Whether you 're a Survivor or one of the Infected , you 're pretty much worthless without your teammates – their skill , and the entire team 's ability to work together , will make the difference between standing tall in the face of adversity , and limping toward the finish line .
As a Survivor , your partners will be there to pick you up when you 've been trampled , heal you if you 've squandered your own supplies , and generally provide cover fire and support .
There are few things worse than being pounced upon or helplessly dragged away , with your friends having gone on without you .
As the Boss Infected in Versus mode , your only chance at victory lies with getting the humans to split up – there 's a hefty re-spawn time after each death , so working as a team is pivotal .
Send your Boomer in first – the bile he vomits works as zombie bait , sending the NPC horde en masse to attack whatever is covered in his puke .
Once those spineless humans are blinded and panicking , Hunters and Smokers will need to swarm in to divide and conquer .
2. Something Really Is Out to Get You
You 'll study the maps , hone your aim , and your team will move like a well - oiled , monster - killing machine .
At which point , the AI Director opens up that magical zombie faucet in the sky , overwhelming you until you escape , or break .
Dynamic , cinematic campaigns means that as you 're wading through corpses , struggling to save ammo and stay alive , every shot you fire and every kill you make is being judged .
Skilled players will be rewarded ( or punished ) with more encounters and greater challenges , while those struggling to survive will find their opposition a little tamer .
This keeps the pace lively , without punishing players .
Each of Left 4 Dead 's 20 maps will provide a different experience every time you play – there is no scripting , and there are no spawn points , just a perpetual torrent of zombies , tailored to your own skill and progress .
3. Keep Your Ears Peeled , or Something Will Do It for You
True to that cinematic vibe it hopes to establish , Left 4 Dead offers up quite a few audio cues to help give players a fighting chance .
Characters issue alerts , letting each other know when ammo or weapons are nearby , or reminding friends to heal .
There 'll also be the occasional reminder to drop whatever it is you 're fiddling around with and get moving , as zombies attack those who linger .
The announcements can get kind of annoying – particularly after the hundredth time someone has announced they 're reloading – but you 'll usually be glad to know exactly what your team is up to while you 're in full panic mode .
The music also plays a very important role in setting up that cinematic experience .
The trill of a horn , a haunting choir or a sudden shift in the melody followed by an ominous quaking each signal that something very unfortunate is about to happen , so listen closely .
And if you 're not averse to voice chatting , get a mike – it can get kind of hard to type when you 're trapped on the ground , firing stray rounds into a disorienting mass of necrotic flesh .
4 . When in Doubt , Stay Calm and Run Like Hell
With the exception of sequences where you 're specifically told to activate an object and then brace for impact , there is no " planning " in Left 4 Dead , and there are no climactic , scripted battles :
The stronger Boss Infected arrive fairly regularly , at the Director 's whim in Campaign mode or perpetually lurking as other players in Versus mode .
No , you 're getting a genuine survival - horror experience : nursing wounds , scrounging for ammo and acknowledging that strategically making a break for it is usually better than getting slaughtered , especially when the enemy seems focused on a player that is n't you .
Yes , sometimes sacrifices must be made .
After all , a team can still be victorious if at least one person survives – whether that means making it to the safe room , or reviving the wounded before they 've died .
So remember that Golden Horror - Flick Rule :
You only have to outrun the slowest person you 're with .
With keen senses , a steady hand and a little luck , you 'll do yourself ( and more importantly , your teammates ) proud .

Too Many Technologies ; Not Enough Brains November 10 , 2008
Hardly a day goes by when I read of a new programming language , a new framework , a new way to solve an old problem .
Yet the pace of invention and evolution is a two - edged sword ; innovation is great but it 's impossible to keep up with it .
Two quotes from one of my favorite movies Amadeus
My dear young man , do n't take it too hard .
Your work is ingenious .
It 's quality work .
And there are simply too many notes , that 's all .
Just cut a few and it will be perfect .
[ Mozart trying on wigs ]
They 're all so beautiful .
Why do n't I have three heads ?
The explosion of new technology in programming has been accelerating in the past decade or so , driven primarily by the open source movement and the web .
The ease at which things can be developed , posted , discussed and spread in an environment of free ideas and easy communication is really astonishing .
My earliest days developing Trapeze needing only the loose - leaf Inside Macintosh , K&R C and a 68000 assembly manual seem barely removed from days of the knights of King Arthur .
What makes the current warp speed difficult is that just knowing what is happening is becoming difficult if not impossible , much less actually evaluating and learning the new technologies and picking those that make sense to you .
I 've always spent time every morning following the software technology " market " .
In the old days I read catalogs and magazines and talked with vendors and it was n't too hard .
Today I could spend every hour of every day and still miss a lot .
Anyone who works in a corporate environment knows how tough it is to get the powers that be to switch to or add a new technology .
Even being a member of the architecture team at one place it took a week of painful meetings to convince the team that using Ajax ( for an app I was developing by myself for inside the company ) was n't the coming of the Anti-Christ .
In my last job one champion of Ruby tried to convince the company that it made sense but finally gave up and left , and the project continued in Java ( and to this day is still wandering in incomplete - ville ) .
The problem is finding a balance between using something new and refusing to change for any reason ; either extreme can be bad .
Even if a company or group is willing to explore and embrace alternate technologies , the issue remains of how can you find , evaluate and master something new before it becomes obsolete or is abandoned in favor of an even newer technology .
At that last job it took several months of work to evaluate a new UI framework between 2 choices ( basically Seam vs. Wicket ) .
Recently I read of 20 template systems for PHP .
When I introduced Ajax at one company in the first year of Ajax I found nearly 200 frameworks already in progress ; I can't image how many there are now .
How do you evaluate 200 different frameworks ?
The real answer is that you can't ; unless we suddenly evolve 8 arms and 3 brains it 's impossible today to do even a barely adequate job of winnowing the changes in technology to those that make sense .
It 's no wonder that many programmers and their employers do n't even try and just stick the the same stuff they 've been doing .
Even if their " approved " choices are terrible , unproductive , unreliable and even expensive there is comfort in the familiar , and fear of unruly change .
Yet the pace of evolution ultimately is to make things better , depending on how you define " better " .
The problem is in the evaluation .
It takes time , talent and tenacity to derive what is really " better " and what is just different .
I love the story ( although I do n't know the exact details ) of yellowpages.com .
The original development was done in whatever passed for a standard process at AT&T ( or whatever they were called at the time ) and it sucked .
Then a small group of folks built a replacement in Ruby - On - Rails in a few months and it rocked .
Of course there are many other stories where new technologies sunk companies as well ( one I worked for briefly tried to replace a PHP storefront with a Java application and to this day after four years still has nothing to show for it ) .
New is not necessarily better ; better is better .
It 's telling the difference that is the hard thing .
Ross is disturbed by McCain 's dearth of policy proposals :
One of the many fascinating things about Robert Draper 's Times Magazine story on the McCain campaign is what is n't included in its account of the attempts to brand ( and rebrand , and rebrand ) John McCain 's candidacy : Namely , any real discussion of policy .
From Draper 's account , the McCain campaign staff has gone around and around trying to figure out how to sell their candidate - as a fighter ! as an experienced leader ! as a maverick !
etc. - but hardly ever seemed to have spent much time thinking about how these narratives would mesh with or be reinforced by the actual policy agenda the campaign was advancing .
But this is , sadly , the core of what has happened to Republicanism under Rove .
We 've been told over and over again that the Bush administration always put politics before policy - and then made Karl Rove its policy czar !
This is how they approached something as grave as war .
We will see a serious conservatism again when Bill Kristol and Karl Rove are banished from the Republican party and from the conservative media .
The Republican implosion is primarily their doing , their achievement , their legacy .
It was when McCain ceded his campaign to Schmidt and Palin ( creatures of Rove and Kristol respectively ) that he threw it all away .
As long as they are given any credence , Republicanism will not recover .

Dear Mr. Obama :
It is me , Timmy , from the 6th grade .
For our civics class , we are writing a letter to tell the new President who we like .
I would like Al Gore to be your Chief Executive Inventor .
He is very skilled and has invented many things .
First he invented the internet , which is very important for things .
Second , he invented global warming .
These are both important problems and he got a lot of money for them .
I endorse Al Gore because he is my hero .
My mom says he is like a preacher , but with more expensive DVD’s .
Sincrely ,
Timmy
Prof Steve
Hanke said : " They still have a way to go to catch Hungary , but they are getting there .
This is conjecture , but if they keep going at this pace , they have a shot at it within a month or maybe a month - and - a - half at the outside . "
New prostitution laws to be set out today will mean a plea of ignorance is no defence for men facing prosecution for buying sex from a woman who has been trafficked or is being exploited by a pimp .
Under proposals to be published today by the home secretary , Jacqui Smith , a man who " knowingly " pays for sex with a woman who has been trafficked or is under the control of a pimp could face a charge of rape , which carries a potential life sentence .
The new offence of paying for sex with somebody who is " controlled for another person 's gain " is to carry a hefty fine and a criminal record .
The decision to criminalise men who pay for sex with trafficked women is likely to have a widespread impact .
The Metropolitan police have estimated that 70 % of the 88,000 women involved in prostitution in England and Wales are under the control of traffickers .
It forms part of a wider package of reforms to tackle street prostitution , including prosecuting first - time kerb crawlers and implementing stronger police powers to close down brothels .
The package marks a sharp change of approach for Labour , which four years ago proposed a partial decriminalisation of prostitution in red - light " tolerance zones " , and then powers to allow two or three women to work together in a brothel to provide protection for each other .
The first proposal , by the former home secretary David Blunkett , was blocked by Downing Street , reportedly because of fears of a hostile media response .
Despite some expectations , today 's package will not include changes to the licensing of lapdancing clubs , although Smith has indicated that proposals will be made in future to regulate them on the same basis as sex shops .
This is expected to give residents stronger powers to object and to lead to the closure of some clubs , especially in residential areas .
The change in the law follows a six - month Home Office - led review of prostitution laws which included visits by ministers , including Harriet Harman and Vernon Coaker , to Amsterdam and Stockholm to see how the law worked there .
Harman has described the flow of women brought into Britain by human traffickers as " a modern slave trade " , and said that it only exists because men are prepared to buy sex : " So to protect women we must stop men buying sex from the victims of human trafficking . "
The home secretary has made clear that under the new offence it will not be enough for a man to say " I did n't know " .
The new offence will include a " strict liability " test so that police will only have to prove that the man paid for sex , and that the woman had been trafficked .
There will be no need to prove he knew it at the time .
The tougher approach will allow first - time kerb crawlers spotted by the police to be prosecuted .
At present , the police can only prosecute persistent offenders .
Police will get powers to close down brothels where there is evidence of trafficking .
The former Home Office minister Fiona Mactaggart yesterday warned that the new criminal offence of paying for sex with a trafficked woman might fall apart in practice , and said there had been no prosecutions in Finland , the only other country where it had been made law .
The English Collective of Prostitutes said yesterday that experience had taught them any law against consenting sex forces prostitution further underground and makes women vulnerable to violence .
Key facts
· Men to be prosecuted if they pay for sex with women who are trafficked or under control of a pimp
· Ignorance that woman was being controlled not to be a defence and conviction to carry hefty fine and criminal record
· Men who knowingly pay for sex with trafficked women may face rape charges
· First - time kerb crawlers face prosecution and naming and shaming
Conservative columnist :
Why the GOP should be ' giving up on God ' RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday November 19 , 2008
Print This Email
This ( Update at bottom : Stop calling Palin people ' low brows and beasts , ' says fellow conservative )
Nationally syndicated conservative columnist Kathleen Parker believes that the Republican Party 's recent election woes can be summarized as " Three little letters , great big problem : G - O - D . "
In her latest column , " Giving Up on God " , Parker cautions Republicans not to " overlook or dismiss the gorilla in the pulpit . "
Writes Parker , " To be more specific , the evangelical , right - wing , oogedy - boogedy branch of the GOP is what ails the erstwhile conservative party and will continue to afflict and marginalize its constituents if reckoning does n't soon cometh . "
After Obama 's election , " like it or not , we are a diverse nation , no longer predominantly white and Christian , " she continues .
" Suffice it to say , the Republican Party is largely comprised of white , married Christians , " observes Parker .
" Anyone watching the two conventions last summer can't have missed the stark differences :
One party was brimming with energy , youth and diversity ; the other felt like an annual Depends sales meeting . "
Continues Parker , " It is n't that culture does n't matter .
It does .
But preaching to the choir produces no converts .
And shifting demographics suggest that the Republican Party -- and conservatism with it -- eventually will die out unless religion is returned to the privacy of one 's heart where it belongs . "
After calling for Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin to quit the race in a September 29 column entitled " How Palin can save McCain , " Parker revealed that she received hate mail from angry right - wingers .
" Only Palin can save McCain , her party and the country she loves , " Parker had written .
" She can bow out for personal reasons , perhaps because she wants to spend more time with her newborn .
No one would criticize a mother who puts her family first .
Do it for your country . "
Two days later , Parker wrote , " Allow me to introduce myself .
I am a traitor and an idiot .
Also , my mother should have aborted me and left me in a Dumpster , but since she did n't , I should ' off ' myself .
Those are just a few nuggets randomly selected from thousands of e-mails written in response to my column suggesting that Sarah Palin is out of her league and should step down .
Who says public discourse has n't deteriorated ? "
Undoubtedly , Parker 's e-mail box will fill up with angry invectives , threats , and , perhaps , prayers for her soul .
And the same right - wing bloggers that claimed to have never heard of her before her infamous Palin column will most probably again blog ignorance .
Stop calling Palin people ' low brows and beasts , ' says fellow conservative
In a column for The Corner at National Review , Jonah Goldberg fires back to his " friend Kathleen Parker , " whose " act is getting really old . "
" I do n't know what 's more grating , the quasi - bigotry that has you calling religious Christians low brows , gorillas and oogedy - boogedy types or the bravery - on - the - cheap as you salute  in that winsome way  your own courage for saying what ( according to you ) needs to be said , " Goldberg writes .
Goldberg tells her to " stop bragging about how courageous you are for weathering a storm of nasty email you invite on yourself by dancing to a liberal tune .
You are n't special for getting nasty email , from the right or the left .
You are n't a martyr smoking your last cigarette .
You 're just another columnist , talented and charming to be sure , but just another columnist .
You are not Joan of the Op - Ed Page . "
" For the record , I have no problem with arguments about how the GOP has become too religious .
I ended my book with pretty much that argument , " Goldberg continues .
" I opposed Mike Huckabee vociferously because he seemed the quintessential rightwing progressive imbued with a rightwing social gospel .
These are all good arguments to make and they have good responses to them .
But please drop the nonsense about how the G - O - D people or the Palin people are low brows and beasts .
There are low brows and beasts everywhere , on every side of the ideological spectrum . "

The U.S. Africa Command ( AFRICOM ) , an organizational construct intended to unify the entire African continent ( except Egypt ) under a single U.S. commander , is due to become fully operational September 30 .
As described by the Pentagon , it will be a new sort of animal , a combatant command “ plus , ” that will have the ability to mount military operations , but which will rely primarily on “ soft power . ” AFRICOM “ will support , not shape , U.S. foreign policy on the continent , ” Theresa Whelan , the Pentagon ’s deputy assistant secretary of defense for African affairs , told a House subcommittee on Wednesday .
But despite official assurances , concern is mounting that AFRICOM could stray from its “ supporting ” role to become the new center of power for U.S. activities in Africa .
The issue is central to the ongoing debate over the new command ’s proper place .
At this week ’s hearing of the House Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs , the first of two scheduled hearings on AFRICOM , General Michael Snodgrass and Ambassador Mary Yates , both members of the command ’s nascent leadership , assured lawmakers that AFRICOM is “ a listening , growing , and developing organization dedicated to partnering with African governments , African security organizations , and the international community to achieve U.S. security goals by helping the people of Africa achieve the goals they have set for themselves . ”
And to its credit , AFRICOM has gone out of its way to calm fears that it represents a new imperial push into the Dark Continent .
( It even hosts a blog to keep the public informed of its progress . )
AFRICOM ’s primary purpose , say proponents , will be to coordinate with the State Department and USAID in the pursuit of “ stability operations ” — one of the Pentagon ’s latest enthusiasms , encoded in Directive 3000.05 , which places humanitarian and relief operations on a level plane with combat missions .
( You can read my earlier piece on the subject here . )
But even AFRICOM ’s good intentions cannot disguise the geopolitical realities that compelled its creation .
It ’s not about doing good works in impoverished countries for their own sake ;
It ’s about national interest .
Countering China ’s growing military and economic influence in Africa and assuring access to some of the world ’s last remaining oil reserves top the list .
( The United States now imports just as much oil from Africa as it does from the Middle East . )
Terrorism also figures into the equation — primarily the elimination of ungoverned spaces terrorists might call home .
Not that these are unreasonable goals .
On one level , the U.S. military ’s ability to adapt is impressive .
But problems could arise if AFRICOM begins to lead policy rather than follow it .
A report released yesterday by Refugees International shows that , in the years since 9/11 , the Pentagon ’s slice of the nation ’s foreign aid budget has ballooned at the expense of more traditional providers , like USAID .
From the report :
Although several high - level task forces and commissions have emphasized the urgne need to modernize our aid infrastructure and increase sustainable development activities , such assistance is increasingly being overseen by military institutions whose policies are driven by the Global War on Terror , not by the war against poverty .
Between 1998 and 2005 , the percentage of Official Development Assistance the Pentagon has controlled exploded from 3.5 % to nearly 22 % , while the percentage controlled by the U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ) shrunk from 65 % to 40 % .
As for foreign military financing , the Pentagon ’s bread and butter , “ more than half of the FY09 budget request … is for just two countries — Djibouti and Ethiopia — considered key partners in the continental War on Terror . ”
AFRICOM has countered criticism of its “ militarization ” of foreign aid with reminders that its command structure will include representatives of other federal agencies , such as State and USAID , to ensure that policy is still guided by civilian authorities .
This , for example , explains Ambassador Yates ’ appointment as “ deputy to the commander for civil - military activities . ”
But though the Pentagon had planned for 25 percent of AFRICOM ’s headquarters staff to come from federal civilian agencies , it recently revised the requirement down to just 4 percent , citing difficulty on the part of partner agencies to spare staff for inter-agency assignments .
As the GAO ’s John Pendleton told the House subcommittee :
Although DOD has often stated that AFRICOM is intended to support , not lead , U.S. diplomatic and development efforts in Africa , State Department officials expressed concern that AFRICOM would become the lead for all U.S. government activities in Africa , even though the U.S. embassy leads decision - making on U.S. government non-combat activities in that country .
Other State and USAID officials noted that the creation of AFRICOM could blur traditional boundaries among diplomacy , development , and defense , thereby militarizing U.S. foreign policy …
Nongovernmental organizations are concerned that this would put their aid workers at greater risk if their activities are confused or associated with U.S. military activities .
Such concerns are overblown , says Whelan .
“ The intent is not for DOD generally , or for [ AFRICOM ] at the operational - level , to assume the lead in areas where State and / or USAID have clear lines of authority . ”
Instead , AFRICOM will simply “ allow the DOD to better coordinate its own efforts , in support of State Department leadership , to better build security capacity in Africa . ”

The appointments are rolling out steadily now for the Obama administration .
Sometimes they are actual announced appointments ; sometimes they are leaks about presumably certain appointments .
But so far , most sound like good news for the LGBT community .
Seven openly LGBT people are part of the transition team which is helping to prepare the president - elect to take charge of the federal government beginning January 20 .
Interestingly , five of them are former appointees of President Bill Clinton .
The three appointments of greatest interest during the past week have been for Secretary of Health and Human Services , U.S. Attorney General , and the White House domestic policy adviser .
Former U.S. Senator Tom Daschle , a longtime friend to the LGBT community , has been tapped to head HHS , though his appointment has not been formally announced .
Daschle represented South Dakota in the U.S. Senate and , while considered friendly to Gay causes , did not score well on his last " scorecard " with the Human Rights Campaign .
He earned only a 63 ( out of a possible 100 ) in his last two years in the Senate .
Daschle declined a request to co-sponsor the Early Treatment for HIV Act of 2003 .
According to HRC , the bill would have enabled people with HIV to receive Medicaid and would enabled people with HIV and low incomes with the ability to receive state aid under the category of " categorically needy . "
He also declined a request to add sexual orientation to his Senate office non-discrimination policy , even though an earlier scorecard showed he did and in the scorecard for the previous two - year session , Daschle earned a 100 percent score .
In recent days , the Obama campaign 's transition website has stated that , " In the first year of his presidency , Barack Obama will develop and begin to implement a comprehensive national HIV / AIDS strategy that includes all federal agencies . "
And Daschle , a senior fellow with the Center for American Progress , a liberal think tank headed by Obama 's transition chief John Podesta , is presumably onboard with that plan .
President - elect Obama is reportedly planning to appoint former Deputy Attorney General ( under Bill Clinton ) Eric Holder as his U.S. Attorney General .
Tracey Conaty , who for many years headed up a group documenting and seeking to prevent LGBT - related hate crimes in Washington , D.C. , said Holder " clearly cared about the issue of hate crimes . "
" He was smart and informed about the law , " said Conaty .
" He was also very respectful , and you got the impression that he took these meetings with community folks seriously . "
Though the position gets far less attention than cabinet positions , White House domestic policy adviser is a critical office to the LGBT community .
The adviser makes recommendations to the president on a wide range of domestic issues , including many that can be of specific interest to Gays .
The position became notorious under President Reagan , when he appointed ultra-conservative activist Gary Bauer to the spot .
To that position , President - elect Obama has named Melody Barnes , a former top aide to U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy , one of the most pro-Gay members of Congress in history .
" She 's smart , sharp , solid - she totally gets the Gay and HIV issues , " says Chai Feldblum , who worked with Kennedy in the drafting of the Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) .
" I worked with her a lot in Kennedy 's office .
I 'm more excited about this appointment than just about anything . "
Transition team
Most familiar among the seven openly LGBT people serving on the transition team is Roberta Achtenberg , who served as assistant secretary in the Department of Housing and Urban Development under Clinton .
Achtenberg garnered more attention than most assistant secretaries when then Senator Jesse Helms referred to her as " that damn Lesbian " and tried to block her confirmation .
Others on the transition team include Michael Guest , former George W. Bush ambassador to Romania ; Fred Hochberg , former Clinton Small Business Administration leader ; Elaine Kaplan , who headed Clinton 's Office of Special Counsel ; Thomas Soto , who was appointed by Clinton to serve on an international commission involved in conservation efforts with Mexico ; Rick Stamberger , president of an online Gay news collection website called SmartBrief ; and Brad Kiley , a deputy assistant for administration at the Clinton White House .
Kiley is one of 13 people listed on the transition 's " Senior Staff , " as one of two " Director of Operations . "
He , along with Soto and Stamberger , are among 21 people on the " Executive Office of the President " team .
Achtenberg is one of 12 people on the HHS transition advisory team .
Guest is one of 11 people on the Department of State segment of the " National Security Team . "
Kaplan is one of 10 people on the " Government Operations Team . "
Hochberg is one of 20 on the " Economics and International Trade Team . "
While the others served under President Clinton , Stamberger was a White House fellow under then Vice President George H.W. Bush , during the Reagan administration .
The seven openly Gay appointees are among about 300 people named to help the Obama administration prepare to take the reins of the government starting January 20 .
Gay leaders have taken note of the Obama transition website 's inclusion of the President - elect commitment 's to Gay civil rights issues .
The Human Rights Campaign called it an " encouraging sign . "
Meanwhile , the Gay & Lesbian Leadership Institute reports having received more than 1,300 applications from LGBT people interested in seeking an appointment with the Obama administration .
Spokesperson Denis Dison says the Institute groups are putting together their own " review teams " to examine the applications and " tease out applicants who are qualified . "
Dison says the Obama transition team is " aware of the project . "

Olbermann to right - wing pundits : ' You do n't matter anymore ! '

In his first show since the election of President Obama , MSNBC host Keith Olbermann gleefully mocked right wing pundits .
As be began to recite what landed them on his ' worst person in the world ' list , Olbermann tossed his notes on each and jeered , " You do n't matter anymore ! "
First up , neoconservative writer Bill Kristol .
" Of Obama 's election , Kristol today writes , quote , ' Sarah Palin ...' " began Olbermann , but then paused .
" Wait a minute .
What 's the difference what he wrote ?

Largest Wind Farm in World Halted By Credit Crisis
November 5th , 2008 by Sarah Lozanova
The credit crunch is not just hurting the banks and the real estate market .
Even the billionaire and wind energy enthusiast , T. Boone Pickens is having trouble financing his high profile 4000 MW wind farm .
The proposed Texas wind farm has a hefty $ 10 and $ 12 billion price tag .
Although we are used to hearing about climbing energy costs , the price of natural gas is actually down .
Natural gas accounts for 20 % of the nation ’s electricity generation .
The energy sector is also suspecting that the financial crisis may result in a global reduction in energy demand .
Pickens ’ plan calls for replacing natural gas with wind energy for electricity generation , while converting vehicles to run off natural gas .
The natural gas currently used for electricity would be used for transportation and America could wean itself off foreign oil .
“ I think it is all going to be put off , because we have got the credit crunch , one , but , two , natural gas prices [ are down ] , so you are going to price wind off natural gas power and right now natural gas is so cheap there will be no new wind deals until natural gas price gets back up , ” Pickens said .
“ Presumably , a lot of capital would have to be raised to move these things forward , and that looks to be extremely difficult in these current conditions , ” said Richard Murray , director of the University of Houston Center for Public Policy .
“ And if crude drifts back down to the $ 50 to $ 60 range , it is going to take a lot of the incentive away to shift your energy paradigm . ”
Crude was trading below $ 65 barrel on Friday afternoon .
Even Pickens ’ energy related hedge fund , BP Capital , posted losses of 60 % this year .
Pickens is certainly not throwing in the towel .
He is creating a “ New Energy Army ” and strives to have 2 million members by enaugeration day .
He currently has over 1.3 million members .
Such publicity including television commercials and print adds for Pickens ’ Plan has caused Americans to think about energy policy .
“ His outcry has neighbors talking over the fence about our energy future , ” said Ned Ross , director of regulatory affairs for a unit of utility FPL Group Inc in Texas .
“ People who either paid no attention to energy or did n’t care are in the debate . ”
Now that the price of gas is below $ 3 a gallon in most markets , Americans are less likely to embrace natural gas for a transportation fuel , which would require significant infrastructure investments .
Obama however is calling for a $ 150 billion investment in clean energy over the next ten years .
The energy future of the U.S. is certainly in transition .

Italian bloggers are up in arms at a court ruling early this year that suggests almost all Italian blogs are illegal .
This month , a senior Italian politician went one step further , warning that most web activity is likely to be against the law .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The story begins back in May , when a judge in Modica ( in Sicily ) found local historian and author Carlo Ruta guilty of the crime of “ stampa clandestina ” – or publishing a “ clandestine ” newspaper – in respect of his blog .
The judge ruled that since the blog had a headline , that made it an online newspaper , and brought it within the law ’s remit .
The penalties for this crime are not onerous : A fine of 250 Euros or a prison sentence of up to two years .
Carlo Ruta was fined and ordered to take down his site , which has now been replaced by a blank page , headed “ Site under construction ” , and a link directing surfers to his new site .
Hardly serious stuff – except that he now has a criminal record , and his original site has disappeared .
The offence has its origins in 1948 , when in apparent contradiction of Article 21 of the Italian Constitution guaranteeing the right to free expression , a law was passed requiring publishers to register officially before setting up a new publication .
The intention , in the immediate aftermath of Fascism , may have been to regulate partisan and extremist publications .
The effect was to introduce into Italian society a highly centrist and bureaucratic approach to freedom of the Press .

The Phoenix office of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency was expecting a record year of deportations in 2008 , but the final numbers exceeded predictions .
A news release just put out by ICE states the agency removed 72,955 illegal immigrants in its fiscal 2008 , which ended in September , compared to 44,376 removed the previous year .
Stepped - up efforts by ICE 's little - known Detention and Removal Operations division , combined with a program to deport illegal immigrants straight from the Maricopa County Jail made the new record possible , as reported in a New Times feature article last month .
New police policies are likely to keep those numbers growing in coming months , as the article detailed .
ICE 's full news release follows :
ICE reports record number of deportations from Arizona Local partnerships increase focus on identifying , removing criminal aliens
PHOENIX – Building on programs targeted at removing criminal aliens and strengthening partnerships with state and local law enforcement agencies , U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) officials in Arizona announced a record number of deportations from the state in 2008 .
During fiscal year 2008 ( October 2007 to September 2008 ) , the Phoenix Office of Detention and Removal Operations ( DRO ) removed 72,955 illegal aliens from Arizona , compared to 44,376 removals the previous year .
“ We made a commitment to the American people to embark on an ambitious enforcement strategy aimed at securing our borders and strengthening our nation ’s immigration system , ” said Julie L. Myers , Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for ICE .
“ The record results seen across the country reflect significant , steady progress toward this goal .
The men and women at ICE , along with our law enforcement partners , deserve our thanks for their hard work and dedication . ”
ICE attributes the significant increase in alien removals from Arizona to the success of the agency ’s Criminal Alien Program ( CAP ) and the extension of federal immigration authority this year to additional state and local jail enforcement officers under the 287 ( g ) program .
For example , as part of a 287 ( g ) agreement reached last year with the Maricopa County Sheriff ’s Office ( MCSO ) , ICE and MCSO set up a joint CAP at Maricopa County ’s inmate intake facility .
Under that program , MCSO personnel and ICE officers check the immigration status of every foreign born individual who is arrested in the county and booked into the facility .
In 2008 , more than 12,000 potentially deportable aliens were identified at MCSO ’s intake facility as a result of the program .
A similar partnership with the Arizona Department of Corrections resulted in the identification of more than 2,500 potentially deportable foreign - born criminals in Arizona ’s state prisons last year .
Last year in Arizona , federally cross-trained local officers lodged nearly 16,000 immigration detainers against people believed to be in the country illegally , more than any state in the nation .
“ Our 287 ( g ) agreement with ICE is both a successful partnership and a crime reduction program .
Alone , approximately 18,000 undocumented aliens have been detected in Maricopa County jails and processed for ICE removal .
We look forward to continuing our partnership with ICE , ” said Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio .
Outside of the 287( g ) program , DRO officers in CAP identified and processed more than 7,000 illegal aliens in Arizona county and city jails for removal .
ICE began CAP in June 2007 to identify criminal aliens in federal , state and local jails and prisons and target them for removal .
Seems that " our troops " now have trouble voting , when , back in 2000 , the GOP kept coming up with still more soldiers ' votes for Bush at the 11th hour and after .
Many of those ballots were too late , and others were improperly filled in -- but , hey , that kind of thing would kill votes only when they would have gone to Gore .
( Later , it came out that Rep. Steve Buyer , R-IN ,
worked closely with the Pentagon to get those iffy ballots rushed to Florida : a bald violation of the ban on partisan activities by the US military . )
This time , the Bush regime ( in league with the Pentagon ? ) has been doing all it can to block the military vote , since " our troops " mostly do n't support McBush , whose record on the troops ' and veterans ' benefits , etc. , has been dismal .
So we 've seen the VA try to keep their hospitalized troops and vets from registering to vote ; and here we see that , this time , there 's no effort to enable those at war to cast their ballots .

Troops may run out of time to cast ballots
By JOHN RILEY / The Dallas Morning News

WASHINGTON - For U.S. troops serving overseas , nothing comes easy .
Not even voting .
Military members may not have enough time to complete and mail in their absentee ballots for Tuesday 's election , thanks to slow mail delivery , lack of information sharing among election officials , and procedural errors .
In the 2006 elections , about a third of the close to 1 million absentee ballots requested by uniformed overseas voters were returned and tallied , essentially disenfranchising the remaining 600,000 - plus service members , according to the federal Election Assistance Commission .
Barack Obama and John McCain have called on state election officials to reduce the voting obstacles for preventing military personnel from voting .
And Texas Sen. John Cornyn sponsored a bill that passed the Senate this month directing the Department of Defense to make absentee voting easier for service members stationed abroad .
Mr. Cornyn has also launched a related Web site .
But problems persist , as illustrated by one Garland native 's struggle to vote in Tuesday 's election .
Air Force Special Agent Robert Douglass Davis , stationed in Europe , moved to a new base in 2007 .
In April , he tried to change the mailing address on his voter registration using an application on the Texas secretary of state 's Web site .
But Agent Davis still had n't received his ballot by early October .
He called the Dallas County Elections Department long distance but encountered problems with the county 's pre-recorded directory .
His mother , Susan , called the elections department and was told that her son's change of address had been received by the department but that his absentee ballot was mailed to his old base .
Because the mail - forwarding service at the base had expired , Agent Davis did n't receive that ballot .
Elections officials said they would send him a ballot at his new base , but that he would have to request a change of address in writing to update the registration on file with the county .
Robert 's father , Doug , was livid about his son 's troubles .
" I think it 's damn pathetic , " said the elder Mr. Davis , who believes the delay will keep his son from voting .
" It 's just due to incompetence . "
But a county elections spokeswoman said the problem is that any changes made to the rolls using the secretary of state 's address - change application are n't automatically transferred to the county rolls .
" It does not update our permanent database , " said Vickey Bynum , early voting mail supervisor for the department .
" We manually have to go in and make changes to the permanent file . "
And county Election Administrator Bruce Sherbet said the secretary of state 's new database and the change - of - address forms were added only in 2006 .
He said similar technology to update county registration information is still several years away .
Mr. Sherbet said Agent Davis ' absentee ballot was remailed to his new base address Oct. 21 .
He said there is a five - day window after Election Day when ballots from abroad can still be received and counted toward a final vote tally .
As of Thursday , Agent Davis still had not received his ballot .

Per Drudge , some brutal late night shots at McCain , who canceled on Letterman tonight :
David Letterman tells audience that McCain called him today to tell him he had to rush back to DC to deal with the economy .
Then in the middle of the taping Dave got word that McCain was , in fact just down the street being interviewed by Katie Couric .
Dave even cut over to the live video of the interview , and said , " Hey Senator , can I give you a ride home ? "
Earlier in the show , Dave kept saying , " You do n't suspend your campaign .
This does n't smell right .
This is n't the way a tested hero behaves . "
And he joked : " I think someone 's putting something in his Metamucil . "
" He can't run the campaign because the economy is cratering ?

WHEN , less than two centuries ago , the famous Laplace was asked by the Emperor Napoleon why God had not been mentioned by him in his celebrated work , " Mechanique Celeste , " and the astronomer replied , " Sire , I have no need of that hypothesis , " he uttered a truth which was fully justified by the science of his time .
Astronomy today is no more in need of the god - hypothesis than it was in Laplace 's day : the facts of cosmological research have done nothing if not completely demolished the last vestige of theistic interpretation .
We live , on the evidence of astronomy , in a godless universe .
[ " You should be more ready than any one else , " said Napoleon to Laplace , " to admit that God exists , for you , more than most , have seen the wonder of creation . "
That atom of cruelty did not realize that it was largely because Laplace had seen so much of the heavens that he was an atheist .
( See Emil Ludwig 's Napoleon , p. 602 . ) ]
To the average individual casually engaged in contemplating the stars , the world above him presents a perfect picture of harmonious relationships .
He beholds a blue vault of exquisite splendor , in which twinkle myriads of far - distant worlds .
He sees the " Stately procession " of the planets , the daily rising and setting of the sun !
The " beautiful order " of the heavens , the " regularity " of the seasons , the fact that our planets " do not collide , " or that our moon does not " fall " into the earth or our earth into the sun , make their silent appeal for the existence of God ; the warmth and light of the sun , the " nicety " with which the earth makes its revolutions " on time , " the alternations of day and night , all tend to show him an " order " and a " harmony " in keeping with his theistic assumptions .
To the astronomer , the facts point otherwise : their meanings and implications go far deeper than their surface indications , and he sees instead a purposeless universe unattended by any signs of intelligent guidance .
This is because there is no superficial sky - gazing or casual observation in his study of the stars .
There are , for him , enough facts in astronomy to shatter theism .
Much of our popular confusion in matters of science rests on a topsy - turvy contemplation of facts .
The story is told of a professor of astronomy who , having concluded his lecture on the planetary system , called for questions from the floor .
A member of his audience arose to ask him the following question : " I can understand , now that you have explained it all , how the astronomer weighs the planets and measures their distances from the sun , but what bothers me is , how did he find out their names ? "
The same , or a similar , bewilderment seems to possess those who as innocently ask the question , " Who made the stars ? "
Quite obviously the question for thoughtful person to ask is , not " Who made the stars ? " but " What made the stars ? "
Astronomers have a definite answer .
They know not only " what " made the stars , but " what " determines their movements in space .
There is no " Who " or celestial personality involved in stellar activity .
Asking an astronomer , " Who made the stars ? " is very much like asking a physicist , " Who made the icicles and pretty ice - drawings on my window - pane ? "
The answer is no more likely to be " ' God " in the one case than " Jack Frost " in the other .
In educated circles the days are largely past when invisible personalities and unseen beings are supposed to have anything to do with natural phenomena .
We are leaving behind us the kindergarten stage of our mental development .
Those who believe in a " supreme intelligence " in the sky overlook an important principle of physiological knowledge .
" Three centuries before the beginning of the Christian era , " writes the distinguished anatomist , G Elliot Smith , [ " The Evolution of the Brain " in ' Creation by Evolution , ' p. 323 . ]
" some of the wise men of Greece already recognized in the brain the real organ of mind ; yet it was reserved for modern times to confirm the accuracy of this early knowledge and to extend it . "
Accordingly , it is well here to recall the materialistic basis of mind .
Thinking is as much a function of structure and organization as breathing or walking .
As functions cannot exist apart from their organs , it is the height of absurdity to imagine a function like thinking existing by itself or wandering about the heavens without a material substratum .
A " pure spirit " hovering over matter is pure nonsense .
Thought is " immaterial " only as respiration and digestion are immaterial -- we cannot see , weigh , or handle functions apart from their organs -- but thinking is as material as matter itself when we consider it mechanically , that is to say , as a form of vibration and sensation in the nerve fibers of the brain and of the nervous system .
Matter thinks quite as well as it walks , and talks , and dresses for the opera ; and without matter thinking is impossible .
" As we understand it at present , " writes George W. Bartelmetz , [ " Human Structure and Development " in The Nature of the World and of Man , p. 468-469 . ]
" a word or idea comes into consciousness as a result of innumerable cortical reverberations back and forth from one cell or group of cells to another . "
Thought is matter in motion .
A cosmic intelligent being would have to be made of matter .
Astronomers are well satisfied that stars and planets move of their own accord , or without any external stimulus of a conscious character .
It is the theistic and spiritualistic muddlers of science who have injected their " God " into the picture , and made of matter a helpless hag of the gutter .
Matter is not that inert mass which vitalists and metaphysicians picture for us .
Even the most subtle forms of matter possess within themselves powerful potentialities and assert themselves in terms of energy .
Every beam of light we receive from the sun carries with it definite weight , weight which , as jeans reminds us , [ The Universe Around Us , p. 117 . ] is " as real as the weight of a ton of coal . "
Every erg of energy has weight and mass .
[ " The essential fact is that an erg of energy in any form has a mass of 1.1.10 - 21 grammes . " -- Eddington , Stars and Atoms , p. 97 . ]
There is no " matterless " or " spiritual " energy , or energy existing by itself ; energy is matter -- matter asserting itself .
Energy , in every form , is always identified with and inseparable from matter ; the two can not be torn apart .
The law of the " conservation of energy " embodies the conservation of matter ; neither matter nor energy is ever destroyed .
Everywhere we are dealing with matter , matter in an endless round of activity , expressed in terms of energy .
Radiation itself is a form of energy ; and that which we call radio- activity is merely a transformation of matter from one form of energy to another .
The disintegration of the nucleus of a uranium atom is followed , in time , by its transference into the nucleus of a lead atom .
No matter is lost in the transition .
Hence , the so - called " annihilation " of the atom consists of nothing else than the breaking up of the nucleus of one kind into the nucleus of another kind of atom .
There is no destruction of matter itself ; nothing is lost -- there has been only a change of one atom into another .
The much - talked - of ( and highly misnamed ) " annihilation of matter " is metaphysical moonshine , prompted by those who do not know what they are talking about or by those who mistake an atomic change for the destruction of matter . "
[ " According to the disintegration theory of Rutherford and Soddy , " writes Sir Edward Thorpe , History of Chemistry , vol 2 , p. 42 , " the radio - active elements are forms of matter undergoing changes resulting in the formation of new forms possessing chemical and physical properties differing from those of the parent substance .
Here is matter undergoing change , not " annihilation . ' ]
All the high - sounding talk , but really empty gibberish , about the " downfall " of materialism rests on phantasies .
Matter matters : it is everywhere ; it can not be destroyed by the breaking up of atoms into other atoms .
It can not be " annihilated " until some metaphysician takes a little matter and " explodes " it out of existence .
[ The materialist is waiting to see the metaphysician " annihilate " matter as thoroughly as he , the materialist , annihilates the mind , or what his spiritualistic opponents call " spirit . "
If the mind , as spiritualists insist , is a self - existent entity , capable of activity apart from the matter of the brain , and able to wander off by itself , a man in a state of coma , or undergoing an operation under the influence of ether or chloroform , ought to be able to witness all that transpires around him .
Instead , his mind is a blank , completely non-existent during the time his brain ceases to function .
His so - called " spirit " cannot survive the derangement of matter , or the suspended functioning of his brain .
A few drops of prussic acid , an inhalation of gas , or a clot on the brain , will unbalance or destroy the most serene mentality .
What the spiritualist calls " immortal " goes dead for hours at a time , and cannot exist even throughout the life - time of the individual .
It is mind , not matter , that is destructible . ]
He can do this only in talk , or by clumsily referring to the " smashing " of atoms into electrons and protons , negative and positive particles which , besides possessing weight , are , in terms of energy , still matter .
It is highly important -- essential to an understanding of astronomy -- that these issues be understood .
The universe -- stars , meteors , clam - broth and brain cells -- is made of matter .
Our American philosopher Santayana does well in insisting on calling matter by its right name , as we call Smith , Smith , and Jones , Jones -- and also in labeling himself " a decided materialist . "
WE live in a material universe , in which we ourselves , as products of the stars , are matter " through and through . "
That we are matter that can think is no more remarkable than there is so much matter , outside ourselves , which never thinks at all .
That matter which thinks has simply reached a certain biological stage .
As C. Judson Herrick observes , [ The Thinking Machine , p. 250 , ] " Mental processes are biological functions of the body in general and of the brain in particular in just the same sense that circulation of the blood is a function of the heart or breathing is a function of the lungs .
The evidence for this is biological evidence . "
Man has no claim for exclusion from the world of matter .
He is as much matter as the world of stars .
Our foundations of knowledge are more solid than the epistemologists would have us believe .
The hazy maze of obscurities and airy abstractions into which we have been led by verbal appeal is losing its lure : our knowledge of the world is fast becoming recognized as of sensory origin .
All claims to supersensory " knowledge " rest on fraud .
Man 's contact with the universe around him is a contact of matter with matter .
There is nothing " spiritual " about it .
He himself is all matter , surrounded by matter .
Whether he is receiving impressions in the form of light from a distant star or as heat waves generated in the sun , or as any other sense perceptions , his sensations are physical and are linked with the brain as the vibrating center .
Here is thinking , or matter in motion .
There is no " spiritual " world , no world of transcendental physics at work within his cerebral cavity .
All concepts of a supersensual world , a world " above " matter , rest on fantastic imagery .
Astronomy would never have reached the zenith of its attainments had it listened to metaphysics .
Stars are physical objects : the dream of a world made of dream ; is for visionaries only .
To the scientist , stars are real objects moving in the skies .
A thousand years from now science will be foretelling eclipses and weighing the stars with as much mathematical precision as it does today : our mystics cannot tell us from one day to the next what metaphysics will be teaching the day after tomorrow .
The knowledge of experience is solid and compact ; its definiteness is paralleled by its crystalline simplicity .
Only in the realm of jumbled ideas do the reachers for rainbows find a world that transcends the evidences of their senses .
Our metaphysicians cannot agree among themselves for two minutes at a time : their revelations from " above " are as hazy and shifty as London fogs .
Like Voltaire 's Zadig , who " knew as much of metaphysics as hath ever been known in any age , that is , little or nothing at all , " our modern mystics take abstractions for realities .
They will tell you where the hole of a doughnut is after the doughnut is eaten , and where the wind and waves are when the air and ocean are at rest .
They talk about the " spiritual nature " of the mind with even more enthusiasm than they talk about the " spirituality " of a toothache or a headache .
Those who believe that knowledge is innate or derived through channels other than experience ought to come into the world as wise as they leave it .
Some of them do ; but it is a poor commentary on their intellectual poverty that they go out no richer than they came in .
He who finds wisdom in a world above matter , i.e. , in the realm of metaphysics , is seeing visions quite as vividly as the drug addict , who can enjoy the most delightful " releases " from the bonds of " dross " matter : a hypodermic injection will give him " transports " that are as ethereal as a chapter from Bergson .
But he will come back to earth , realizing that matter was behind it all .
And he can become " spiritualized " again only by the use of a little more matter , even though , in his " spiritual " moments , he holds it in contempt .
And here we must take issue with the statement of Bertrand Russell [ philosophy , p. 98 ; " The Structure of the Atom . " that " matter has become as ' ghostly ' as anything in a spiritualistic seance . "
How " ghostly " it has become may be judged by anyone who has walked complacently into a dark room and stumbled over a chair , or collided with an automobile .
For most of us , matter is real .
A man engaged in metaphysical reveries may talk of the " ghostliness " of matter until he talks himself out of existence .
To say that matter is " ghostly " because its atoms can be divided into smaller units is the same as saying that the Atlantic Ocean is " ghostly " because it is made up of molecules .
Water does not cease to be material because it is composed of units smaller than those of oxygen and hydrogen .
A sea captain in a storm , whose ship is being battered by the waves , could never be convinced that matter is " ghostly , " no matter how many electrons and protons compose a particular wave .
It is enough for him that these mountains of matter , in the form of water , are pounding his ship .
Those who believe in the " ghostly " qualities of matter must first show that what we call matter becomes something else when it is reduced to electrons and protons .
This they can not do .
It is not enough to show us that matter can be reduced to electrons and protons ; it must be shown in what way these units of the atom are not matter .
Certainly they possess all the attributes of matter .
As long as electrons and protons possess mass and weight they are material particles .
" The mass of a proton , " says Russell , [ Philosophy , p. 100 . ] " is about 1,835 times that of an electron : it takes 1,835 electrons to weigh as much as one proton . "
When , we ask , did any ghost weigh as much as that ?
The " ghostliness " of matter turns out to be metaphysical quibbling .
The old law as to the impenetrability of matter applies to the interior of the atom .
Not only do two electrons never travel in the same orbit , but they never occupy at the same time the same space .
An electron , far out from its nucleus and describing a large orbit , is , as Jeans says , [ The Universe Around Us , p. 130 . ] " a plain material particle . "
The nucleus of the atom , or the proton , is material : its weight is hundreds of times that of the electron itself .
The atom is composed of material units as surely as babies are composed of flesh and blood .
There is no need to talk of " empty spaces " in the atom : they exist .
But a man hit with a golf - ball or an Indian club might think otherwise : it would take more than a suave assurance to convince him that what really bumped him on the cranium were innocent little electrons and protons .
A lot he cares about tiny particles moving in orbits : in the language of horse - sense , he has been struck by matter .
And he has felt the same thing when he strikes his finger with a hammer or gets it caught in the jamb of a door .
The " ghostliness " of matter becomes a real materialization under the laws of everyday physics .
We live in a world of tangible realities , composed of matter .
A bar of steel , a slab of marble , or a bit of granite are concrete forms of matter .
To say that matter ceases to exist when either or all of these things are reduced to electrons and protons , is to play with words : the smallest components of matter are still matter .
Theoretically and experimentally , we know that the electron and the proton are material particles .
Rutherford 's picture of the atom is substantially that of a tiny solar system , " the heavy central nucleus playing the part of the sun and the electrons acting the parts of the planets . "
[ Jeans , The Universe Around Us , p. 105 . ]
Our up - to - date model of the structure of the atom no more invalidates the doctrine of materialism than it invalidates the materiality and ponderosity of the stars ; an atom composed of electrons and protons is as material as the early atom of the Greeks : it has gained nothing in " spirituality " nor " ghostliness " by being found to contain negative and positive charges of electricity .
That it can be " divided " into particles moving in tiny orbits around a center , like planets around the sun , means nothing more than that here again is matter in motion .
The metaphysicians and mystics of our day will have to look elsewhere than to modern physics for a dismissal of matter .
All this , of course , is preliminary to a study of the stars .
We can only know what the stars are , and of what they are composed , by a reference to physics .
The laws of substance govern the largest as well as the smallest bodies .
Stars and atoms are both matter .
Hence , the doctrine of materialism -- the doctrine that matter in motion makes up the whole of existence -- is at once applicable to the entire range of phenomena .
It embraces the stars , circling in vast orbits , down to the tiny solar system whirling within the atom .
Man stands midway between a world of enormous bodies and a world of tiny particles .
And he " falls apart " the same as the stars when the " infinitesimals " shift their positions or change their configurations .
The early atom of the Greek was a tiny hard sphere , supposed to represent the least and indivisible unit of matter .
There is nothing in our present understanding which prevents us from believing that far down in matter there is somewhere an indestructible unit .
The fact that matter is indestructible leads to this conclusion ; in no other way can we account for its eternal persistency .
Break it up as we may , its total volume is the same .
Nowhere is there any evidence of the " annihilation of matter . "
[ Matter is indestructible , and all the fine - spun talk , by metaphysicians and others , about the " annihilation " of matter is verbal exercise .
" We have no evidence , " says A.S. Eddington , " that the annihilation of matter can occur in nature . "
( Stars and Atoms , p. 101 . )
No one , not even Eddington , has yet been able to talk matter out of existence .
The dialectical destroyers of matter are merely walking with their heads in the clouds .
" No direct observational confirmation , " says Jeans , The Universe Around Us , p. 189 , " is at present available . " ]
The " atom " of modern science is quite another thing than that which the word designated among the Greeks .
It is a unit of the molecule , and is in itself a mass of units .
Less " solid " than the " atom " of the Greeks , it is in every way as material .
There is nothing intangible about its component parts -- the electrons and protons .
They give us evidence of their existence in terms of mass and weight .
Those who preface their study of the stars with a glance into physics need not trouble themselves over the " splitting " of the atom .
The universe , around us and within , is as solid as before .
Nor need those who have been brought up on Newtonian and Euclidian principles trouble themselves about the much - paraded " curvature of space . "
" This curved space is not , it is true , " writes Jeans , [ The Universe Around Us , p. 72 . ] " the ordinary space of the astronomer .
It is a purely mathematical and probably wholly fictitious space " -- a space which , when linked with time , " is nothing but a convenient fiction of the mathematician . "
Real space -- that in which matter extends itself in three dimensions , breadth , length , height -- is the space of human experience ; the formal linking of space and time being in the nature of a cryptic experiment of higher mathematics .
" Real space and real time undoubtedly are distinct , " says Jeans .
[ Ibid , p. 76 . ]
They are undoubtedly such when we consider that the two leading exponents of " curved space , " Einstein and de Sitter , have recently seen fit to modify their expressions , and jointly affirm that the facts fit an uncurved and three - dimensional space .
[ " Einstein Rejects Curved Space , " Literary Digest , May , " 1932 . ]
This is the space of Sir Isaac Newton , the space known to our boyhood days when fish and fishing - poles had three dimensions , and when we were rightly taught that parallel lines never meet .
The space in which stars travel is as three - dimensional as that in which cows , horses and motor - cars move .
Astronomy has suffered as much from an overdose of mathematics as from the " mirages of metaphysics " ( Durant ) .
The simplest and most obvious facts have been turned into reveries .
We have been treated not only to an avalanche of impossible verbalism but to fog - producing phrases like " space bending back upon itself " -- which is the same as picturing a vacuum in the act of turning a backward handspring , or nothing being distorted by a stomach - ache .
The whole gamut of metaphorical license has been used to befuddle and confuse .
Those who think clearly will talk and write clearly ; and it will take a wholesome naturalism to clean the Augean stables of accumulated mysticism .
As the late Dr. David Starr Jordan wrote to the present writer , " Perhaps one virtue of the revival of obscurantism is to wake scientific men up to popular statement of the truths with which we deal . "
That astute Englishman , John Stuart Mill , [ " The Idea of God in Nature . " ] rightly pointed out that it is the " vastness " of the universe which most impresses man .
But " vastness " by itself is nothing to admire : bigness counts for nothing unless it carries with it substantial virtues .
We may marvel at the towering strength and muscular development of a brawly individual , but if he behaves before us like a bully or a fool , his size is unimpressive .
It means nothing to a sea-anemone that it lives in the ocean , when its movements are so circumscribed and it must thrive within such narrow limits .
An ocean of worlds spinning around us are as useful as though they did not exist .
Indeed , as Mill remarks , [ Ibid . ] in speaking of the universe , " though the vast scale of these phenomena may well excite wonder , and sets at defiance all idea of rivalry , the feeling it inspires is of a totally different character from admiration of excellence . "
It is the enormous power and " bigness " of the universe that cause us to pause : its activities themselves rival stupidity .
IT was the Psalmist who said , " The heavens declare the glory of God . "
They proclaim nothing of the sort : what they really reveal is nothing but extraordinary waste and ultimate futility .
The blindly - working nature of stellar activity is everywhere apparent .
Wherever we look in the starry expanse we are faced with stupendous energy spent in the production of trivial " ends , " which are like their " beginnings . "
Vast stores of solar energy are squandered throughout interstellar depths , while bodies needing light and heat are left in darkness and cold .
Wherever we turn we are confronted with " means - to - ends " all out of proportion to the " ends " achieved , and with a consumption of time and materials which , measured by , intelligent standards , borders on the criminal .
Everywhere is prodigious activity wasted in boundless dissipation .
Untold billions of years are spent in the ceaseless revolutions of orbs only to result in a small inhabited planet and a myriad of barren and uninhabitable globes !
An ocean of stars kept in endless rotation -- for what ?
Vast continents or clusters of stars , too hot for the sustenance of living forms , move in stupendous circles in dreary monotony .
Stars are born from nebulae only to pass through successive degrees of temperature and end in death .
One in every three stars splits in two through excessive rotation and leads itself a merry chase as double stars circling each other .
The endless grind of motion of going nowhere and arriving at nothing is the supreme accomplishment of the universe .
Everywhere is the dismal picture of undirected energy spent in bat - blind futility .
" We find , " writes Hugh Elliot , [ Modern Science and Materialism , p. 39 . ]
" nothing but unimaginable tracts of space and time , in which move bodies by fixed laws towards ends which are wholly fortuitous , and have not the smallest relation to the advantage and requirements of man . "
From the viewpoint of utility , the motions of heavenly bodies are empty and meaningless .
No one in his proper senses can discern the slightest trace of design in stellar gyrations and the ceaseless spinning of globes .
Of what use is it to the human race ( the so - called " end-all " of existence ) to be hurled through the heavens at 18 miles a second ?
What good does it do any of us to be catapulted through the skies and whirled at the same time ?
What good does it do God 's lesser masterpieces -- the toads , tarantulas and typhus germs -- to participate in these celestial rides ?
Why the silly goose - chase , the merry - go - round of the spheres over such protracted periods of time ?
To ascribe these aimless and senseless activities to intelligence is to insult intelligence .
Only a charitable sense of humor can help one to overlook the stark stupidity of attributing these motional futilities to a guiding mind .
Some find it difficult to conceive how a rotating cloud of star dust could , without a god , evolve into our world , with all its manifold forms of life , its complex structures , its Wagnerian operas , and its Shakespearean dramas .
Extremes are always striking , and when seen without their intermediate steps , appear hopelessly apart .
Yet the connections between gaseous worlds and man and his sometimes more than gaseous attainments are interwoven with time : an evolution of billions of years .
Man himself is an evolution from the lowest specks of life , [ The evolution of man from lowly forms of life is a commonplace of biology .
" Struggle as we may , be as snobbish as we will , " writes John M. Tyler , professor of biology , Amherst College , " we can not shake off these poor relations of ours .
...
If we appeal from adult anatomy to embryology the case becomes all the worse for us .
Our ear is lodged in the gill - slit of a fish , our jaws are bronchial arches , our hyoid bone the rudiment of this system of bones supporting the gills .
Our circulation begins as a veritable fish circulation ; our earliest skeleton is a notochord ; Meckel 's cartilage , from which our lower jaw and the bones of our middle ear develop , is a whole genealogical tree of disagreeable ancestors .
Our glandula thyreoidea has , according to good authorities , an origin so slimy that it should never be mentioned in polite society . "
( The Whence and Whither of Man , p. 99 . ) and his attainments have slowly emerged from the gropings of the jungle .
Music itself is a matter of evolution from the savage tom - tom , and art in form and color finds its crude beginnings in scratches on stone and mud-daubs made on the dripping walls of caves .
After all , it is not a far cry from a rotating nebula to musical notes , from " dancing atoms " to music .
In spite of pretty words , the sounds of a violin are scrapings of horsehair on cat - gut : it is man , able to distinguish between pleasing and offensive sounds , who has slowly perfected melody .
It does not require a miracle to develop the universe from a gaseous beginning .
Anyone who has seen the two gases , oxygen and hydrogen , before mixing would never suppose that they would produce a liquid like water : yet a combination of these two elements will result in a mixture that is distinctly different from either ingredient .
If two different kinds of atoms can do this , by mixing , in the space of a moment , what can we not expect from the intermixture , and countless combinations , of 90 or more different atoms over vast periods of time ?
just as the richness of our language can be developed out of 26 letters , and includes every word in the dictionary , so can the complexity of the universe be made out of the 90 or more atoms .
[ Life itself is an assemblage of atoms .
" There is , " says Sir Edward Thorpe , " no absolute distinction to be drawn between the chemistry of the inorganic and organic worlds . "
And , again : " There can be no reasonable doubt that the chemical processes of organic life are essentially similar to those of the laboratory .
History of Chemistry , vol .
1 , p. 128 , and vol. 2 , p. 134 . ]
The facts speak for themselves .
Man , who himself is 75 per cent .
water , can , being more than a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen , do what the ocean cannot do : weigh the stars .
A nebula could easily have contained the raw material of all that exists .
It was Tyndall himself who saw in matter the promise and potency of all terrestrial life .
[ Prof. A.E. Schafer , who succeeded Tyndall as president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science , made a similar declaration : " Nothing stands between chemical elements and the phenomenon called life but the knowledge of exactly how to combine the elements . "
( Presidential Address , Dundee , Scotland . ) ]
" All the innumerable substances , " writes Jeans , [ The Universe Around Us , p. 101 . ]
" which occur on earth -- shoes , ships , sealing - wax , cabbages , kings , carpenters , walruses , oysters , everything we can think of -- can be analyzed into their constituent atoms .
...
It might be thought that a quite incredible number of different kinds of atoms would emerge from the rich variety of substances we find on earth .
Actually the number is quite small .
The same atoms turn up again and again , and the great variety of substances we find on earth result , not from any great variety of atoms entering into their composition , but from the great variety of ways in which a few types of atoms can be combined . "
God -believers have assumed that because they see " order " in the universe , an intelligence must have " ordained " this " order , " or " planned " things the way we see them .
Our idea of " order " is necessarily derived from the existing conditions , whatever these happen to be ; and no matter what arrangement might prevail , we would be sure to observe " order . "
It is in the nature of the case impossible for a thing , or even a group of things , not to bear relationship to all other things , and whatever relationship exists constitutes the " established order . "
No one can think of a thing which would not stand , in all of its parts , in " orderly " relationship to the whole .
It is impossible to imagine a sequence of events which would not constitute " order " or which would not appear to us as " properly connected . "
If the sun revolved around the earth , instead of the earth around the sun , or if the earth were a disk spinning like a cart - wheel through space , instead of a globe rotating on its axis , we would recognize this as the " established order " of motion , even though it were the precise opposite of what we observe now .
In brief , any combination of conditions or circumstances in which we might find ourselves would appear " orderly " to our perception , because it is the existing conditions which establish the " order . "
The same , or similar , remarks hold good for the use of the word " system . "
Astronomers speak of our solar aggregation as a " system , " not because it is intelligently laid out , but because the term designates a group of bodies in space which are moving in a particular formation , and whose activities , both individually and collectively , follow a certain degree of regularity of movement .
These activities we note and tabulate under the word " system . "
Any group of bodies moving with regularity and in definite formation would constitute a " system , " regardless of what motions they pursued or what activities we observed .
We would still be dealing with a " system " if the planets trailed behind the sun , like a company of soldiers marching in single - file formation .
In fact , two stars circling each other constitute a " system . "
The word " system " does not denote intelligent guidance in the working of the cosmos .
[ The atheist d'Holbach was once chided by Voltaire for writing a book called the System of Nature .
The sage of Ferney could not perceive how a non-believer in God could speak of " system " in the universe .
It would have done Voltaire good if he could have observed , under a microscope , the " systematic " growth of a malignant tumor and the " systematic " break - down of living cells in gangrenous affections .
Nature is always " systematic , " from the spinning of stars to human putrefaction . ]
Stars exist neither for themselves , nor for us , nor for the " glory of God . "
They exist because billions of years ago a nebulous ocean of matter broke up into parts and formed itself into stars .
What happened then , we see duplicated today on an almost parallel scale in the star - forming nebulae of distant space .
There is nothing more supernatural in the occurrence than in the gradual breaking up of rarified gases into globulous bodies by a process of slow condensation .
This occurs through the agency known as " Gravitational Instability . "
" This causes any mass of chaotic gas to break up into detached condensations , " writes Jeans [ The Universe Around Us , p. 207 . ] -- a purely physical manifestation .
The " cause " of the stars is definitely known .
The universe , therefore , did not come into existence at the command of a Ghost .
It is , in its entirety , a self - contained , self - determined , independent reality , consisting of matter in an endless concatenation of physical and chemical changes .
This is the message of astrophysics and astronomy .
Needless to say , it is in entire conflict with the Aladdin - like nonsense taught by religion , in which a cosmic Genius or celestial Magus performs miracles under the name of God .
What we see around us in the heavens is the celestial media called matter undergoing change .
Stars , suns , planets , satellites , comets , meteors are but temporary formations in the vast ocean of space .
Matter alone is eternal ; it changes only its forms , and the universe of heavenly bodies we see today is as surely destined to destruction as is the tiniest of living forms .
The story of astronomy presents a most imposing refutation to those who assume a supernatural origin of cosmic bodies , or who insist that celestial activities are governed by intelligence .
We shall here review the evidence as it applies to stellar development and decay , with particular reference to the idea of God .
And in pursuing our aim we shall keep before us the very stimulating advice of John Dewey : [ Reconstruction in Philosophy , p. 140 . ]
" The first distinguishing characteristic of thinking is facing the facts -- inquiry , minute and extensive scrutinizing , observation . "
Our studies of the universe show the uniformity of its chemical structure and generally of its physical laws .
We are made of the same stuff as the stars , so when we study astronomy we are in a way only investigating our remote ancestry and our place in the universe of star stuff .
Our very bodies consist of the same chemical elements found in the most distant nebulae , and our activities are guided by the same universal rules .

THE study of the heavens dates back to remote antiquity and to early periods of pagan culture .
As far back as the third millennium B.C. , equinoxes and solstices were determined by the Chinese .
This we learn from the decrees promulgated by the Emperor Yao ( 2300 B.C. ) , as recorded in the " Shu Chung , " a collection of documents ancient even in the time of Confucius .
In Egypt , as Agnes Mary Clerke remarks , [ Article " Astronomy , " Ency .
Brit . ]
" the curiously precise orientation of the Pyramids affords a lasting demonstration of the high degree of technical skill in watching the heavens attained in the third millennium B.C. "
The orbital motions of the planets were also known : " The Babylonian computers were not only aware that Venus returns in almost exactly eight years to a given starting - point in the sky , but they had established similar periodic relations in 46 , 59 , 79 and 83 years severally for Mercury , Saturn , Mars , and Jupiter . "
The movement of celestial bodies was not unknown to the ancient Greeks .
Centuries before the so - called " Savior " of man came to earth to teach his doctrines of demonology and the immediate destruction of the world , the celestial bodies had been studied by the Greeks , and a fair approximation had been reached as to the motions , of the earth .
Pythagoras ( 600 B.C. ) and Philolaus ( 480 B.C. ) taught the rotation of the earth on its axis once in every twenty - four hours .
Aristarchus , a famous Greek astronomer ( 250 B.C. ) was the first to maintain that the earth moves around the sun .
" Leukippos and Demokritos , " writes Sir Edward Thorpe , in his ' History of Chemistry , ' " explained the creation of the world as due solely to physical agencies without the intervention of a creative intelligence . "
These teachings , the result of pagan culture , were later obliterated by the corroding influence of Christian authority , and by the sacred writings of Hebrew tradition in which the Christians believed .
" From the fourth to the thirteenth century , " writes Joseph McCabe , [ The Truth About Galilee , p. 34 . ]
" Christendom had completely forgotten all that the race had already learned about the stars . "
The Church put every obstacle in the path of those opposed to its teachings .
Roger Bacon was imprisoned .
Copernicus , in fear of persecution , withheld , for twelve years , the publication of his manuscript " On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Orbs . "
Bruno was burned at the stake by the Catholic Inquisition , and the aged Galileo was dragged before the Holy Tribunal to abjure , under threat of torture , the propagation of a doctrine which the Christian Church pronounced false and inimical to the faith .
The Aristotelian philosophy , which taught that the earth is the fixed center of the universe , bore the sanction of the Church .
To question it was to go counter to papal decree and the God- inspired wisdom of popes .
Besides , had not Jehovah , the God of the Bible , " made the stars also " as mere afterthoughts at the time of creation ?
And were there not holy texts to show that the earth existed before the sun ?
Under priestly domination , ignorance abounded throughout Christendom .
[ The ignorance of the saints was appalling .
The Catholic Encyclopedia ( Article " Antipodes " ) quotes St. Augustine , a distinguished ambassador of God , as stating : " As to the fable that there are Antipodes , that is to say , men on the opposite side of the earth ... men who walk with their feet opposite ours , there is no reason for believing it . "
" Christianity , " remarks Draper , " had been in existence fifteen hundred years , and had not produced a single astronomer . "
( Conflict Between Religion and Science , p. 157 ) .
Man's " immortal soul " was everything , his body nothing .
Material things were of trifling significance .
Stars , sun , and earth would soon be blotted out by an infuriated God , who had once drowned the world and who was now intent on judging man and bringing everlasting punishment to those who had offended him .
Personal salvation alone mattered at the end of the world , when vast hordes of human beings were to be cast into lakes of eternal hell - fire and suffer with " gnashing of teeth . "
Here were the tidings of great joy brought by the lowly Nazarene .
It was the age of faith , when thousands of angels danced on the point of a pin and the heavens proclaimed the glory of God .
It was the golden age of priests .
It was not until 1608 -- a little over three centuries ago and a mere yesterday in the life of our world -- that the first telescope was constructed ( the name of its maker -- Lippershey -- ought to be blazoned in the memory of every man ) .
It was destined to turn the world of traditional nonsense right - side up , and establish man 's true place in the universe of stars .
The coming of the telescope marks a pivotal point in the history of human thought .
Before this instrument was invented , man 's insight into the stellar world around him was narrowly circumscribed by visual limitations .
His eyesight was of extremely feeble range , and not until he had increased his natural vision by the aid of artificial lenses was he able to penetrate into the more distant realms of space .
By thus augmenting his supposed " God- given " eyesight with powerful lenses of his own construction , he has done more in three hundred years of telescopic development to perfect his visual capacity than nature has done in all these millions of years of organic evolution .
Today , with natural vision alone , man can see , in a perfectly clear sky , only 3,000 stars .
With a giant instrument of his own construction he can observe and photograph 1,500 million stars ,
This is half a million times as many stars as nature permits him to see with the naked eye .
This is because the lens in the telescope is intelligently fashioned on scientific lines ; and it has taken man , to perfect it , only a fractional part of the time which nature has taken , working blindly over millions of years , to evolve the human eye , with all its inherent weaknesses and well - known optical defects .
[ Helmholtz , an outstanding authority in the field of optical science , in speaking of the human eye , remarked : " If an optician sent it to me as an instrument , I would send it back with reproaches for the carelessness of his work and demand the return of my money . "
( See Prof. J.B. Bury 's A History of Freedom of Thought , p. 182 ) .
The new door unlocked by science opened upon a vast domain of unexplored space .
Man 's place in the universe began to shrivel to its proper proportions .
Slowly he began to realize that he and his little earth were inconsequential things in the world of stars .
The priests , the witch - doctors , and the miracle - mongers of religion had told him a different story .
He was , they claimed , at the center of the universe , and the aim and end of all creation .
Uncritical man believed .
Providence watched over him ; saints preserved him if he did the bidding of the Church .
Prayers would alter events , and faith would move mountains .
Had not a Jewish patriarch once made the sun stand still , and had not a prophet ascended into heaven ?
It was a pious pipe - dream , of course , in which the vicious hand of priestcraft and crass ignorance were everywhere in evidence .
The telescope shattered this illusion .
Man shrank to the impotence of an inconspicuous speck in space , and with him shrank earth , and sun , and stars and " giant " constellations .
Not one of these relatively - tiny globules or Clusters in the vast ocean of the sky , was really important in itself .
As for the stellar universe as a whole , it , too , has shriveled to a microscopic dot ; and the modern , high - powered reflector has , paradoxically as it may seem , made the universe of stars appear to us at once extremely large as well as extremely small .
It is because man is infinitesimally small that the stellar universe seems immeasurably large .
In its proper proportions it is a trifling thing in itself .
Measured in terms of space , or in relation to nothingness , it shrivels to the vanishing point .
" Empty Waterloo Station of everything except six specks of dust , " writes Sir James Jeans , [ The Universe Around Us , p. 87 . ] " and it is still far more crowded with dust than space is with stars . "
Here briefly we have a compact picture of the " glory " of the heavens as revealed by the telescope .
Now , an " Intelligence " which could do no better than to " fill " Waterloo Station with six specks of dust , after working for countless billions of years , would not be entitled to a Nobel prize for achievement ; and we must look to purely blindly - working forces , inherent in matter itself , for an interpretation of phenomena .
The universe is not the product of a mind .
It is estimated to have taken cosmic evolution somewhere between 10,000,000 million and 20,000,000 million years to produce our universe as we see it today , and this includes the entire period of transition from nebulae to stars and from stars to earth .
It is an inconceivably vast stretch of time for the development of that which is the equivalent proportionately of six specks of dust in a great railroad terminal , and the wonder is that we look upon the " result " as in any way striking or important .
It is only because we are living amid these tiny , floating specks , and that we are star - dust ourselves , that the matter is of human interest .
There is , in the religious meaning of the term , no " harmony of the spheres . "
" Harmony " implies a close coordination of parts and mutual interactions for common or beneficial ends .
These do not exist : collisions , conflagrations , explosions , catastrophes , annihilations of cosmic bodies are of daily and hourly occurrence .
The stellar depths are strewn with the debris of larger bodies -- of wrecked planets and smashed satellites , of stars shattered by rotating too fast .
And headed for the celestial scrap - heap are the myriads of meteors that shower the heavens like rain , and enormous - tailed comets which dart aimlessly about , and burnt - out moons which spin and spin as mute reminders of beginnings that end in spinning .
Added to these are the binary stars , caught by mutual attraction , and forced forever to travel around each other in senseless revolutions .
Nor is there the slightest indication of a general " plan " or uniform pattern in the structure , shape , composition and motions of heavenly bodies .
There is no " uniformity " as to size , weight , temperature , density , luminosity , or placement of the stars .
[ Thus the huge star Sirius A , with a diameter fifty times that of its dwarf companion Sirius B , weighs only three times as much as the similar star : the latter being so densely packed that each cubic inch contains nearly a ton of matter .
These are extremes .
In general , the discrepancies are not so great .
With temperature nearly twice that of the sun , Sirius A stands out as the most brilliant star in the sky .
It is familiarly known as the Dog - star . ]
They differ in every conceivable way , like a helter - skelter of odd things thrown together in hopeless confusion .
Large stars may , in some cases , weigh less than even smaller ones .
This , of course , is due to their differences in density .
Stars range in size from super - giants like Antares ( which occupies 90,000,000 times as much space as the sun ) to dwarf stars like van Maanen's , which is as tiny as the earth .
The distances between the stars and their nearest neighbors vary from a few million to many millions of miles .
Some stars are young , some middle - aged , some old .
There are vast patches in the heavens where no stars exist ; others where mighty clusters are gathered , or where two lonely binary stars , far removed from the rest , whirl out their hopeless destiny .
Nebulae have no well - defined outlines ; and of the millions that exist there are perhaps no two alike .
Nor do they all give birth to stars .
Even the solar system itself is without complete motional uniformity .
The planets of our " system " are all moving in one direction -- except Uranus , which moves from north to south .
The satellite of Neptune moves counter to the entire system of satellites .
" The most curious feature of this satellite , " writes Newcomb , [ Astronomy for Everybody , p. 235 . ]
" is that it moves from east to west . "
Again , the planets differ greatly in the eccentricities of their orbits , or in the ellipses they describe .
Some planets are hot , some cold .
Two have nine satellites ; one , four ; one , two ; two , one ; and two have no satellites .
Some are more flattened at the poles than others ; each varies in respect to the inclination of its axis to the plane of its orbit .
Even the orbits themselves are not placed on a level or horizontal plane with respect to one another : if we regard the earth 's orbit as " horizontal , " the orbits of the other planets are tipped at various degrees .
There is no " even keel " in the heavens .
Even the earth 's axis is not stable but wobbles in its rotation .
" The axis of the earth does not preserve an invariable direction in space , but in a certain time it describes a cone , in much the same manner as the axis of a top spinning out of the vertical . "

The courses of the comets are most irregular , varying from elliptical to parabolic and hyperbolic orbits , describing the most eccentric curves in their wanderings through space .
Sometimes a comet is " captured " by one of our planets , or , by coming too close to the sun , is split into fragments .
Nowhere is there stability or permanency in the heavens .
Nor is there a " deign . "
In sum , the universe as we see it is precisely what we might expect under the circumstances : an aggregation of activities that know not what they are doing nor where they are headed in their mad - hatter pace -- a series of occurrences which block and trip each other at every turn , by undoing , in a single instant , what they laboriously did a moment ago : a game of building and destroying without purpose or end .
And behind it all there is no sign of that ghostly being which is said to guide the Whole .
" Experience , " writes Hugh Elliot , [ Modern Science and Materialism , p. 39 . ] " affords not the smallest trace of evidence for the existence of any spiritual entity . "
The stately drama of stellar evolution turns out to be more like the hair - breadth escapades of the films .
The music of the spheres has almost a suggestion of -- jazz .
-- Sir A.S. EDDINGTON .
[ Stars and Atona , p. 27 . ]
Each star may be considered to go through a series of changes analogous to those of a human being from birth to old age .
In its infancy a star is simply a nebulous mass ; it gradually condenses into a smaller volume , growing hotter ... until a stage of maximum temperature is reached , when it begins to cool off .
-- SIMON NEWCOMB .
[ The Stars , p. 220 . ]
The stillness of the heavens is , however , apparent only , for commotion of the fiercest kind is raging on all sides .
Stars are suns , and the suns are spheres of fire blazing with fury indescribable ; scenes of activity so tremendous that no vehemence of tempest or tornado on earth can give the slightest idea of their fearfulness .

Matter , says the spectroscope , is essentially the same every where , in the earth and the sun , in the comet that visits us once in a thousand years , in the star whose distance is incalculable , and in the great clouds of " fire mist " that we call nebulae .

" CHOOSE a point in space at random , " writes Jeans , [ The Universe Around Us , p. 106 . ] " and the odds against its being occupied by a star are enormous . "
This is because relatively empty space itself makes up , by far , the major part of celestial existence .
Stars are so distant from the earth that their movements in the sky cannot be observed by the naked eye , and , it is only by the aid of the most powerful telescopes that we can detect their change of relative position .
From one year to another , or even from century to century , they appear as " fixed " points of light .
No wonder that many of the ancients thought them immovable .
Yet move they do , and at speeds that transcend the imagination .
It may be stated in general that stars travel at a speed equal to 1,000 times that of an express train , one of them in particular reaching the tremendous velocity of 150 miles per second .
This is the star Groombridge 1830 , mentioned by Eddington .
Why they should thus speed through space when speeding will only bring them back to where they were before , why they should pursue this ceaseless , endless chase , is for the design - arguers to explain .
If there is any intelligence manifested in this useless expenditure of energy , this mad pace , century after century , aeon after aeon , it is not apparent ; on the contrary , it indicates a response to the blind urge of non-thinking necessity .
Everywhere in the heavens bodies are in motion ; and they are held to their orbits by the iron hand of gravitation , with all its actions and interactions in the ever - changing field of stellar movement and positions .
Nowhere is there rest .
Even the great galactic system of which we form a part and which , according to Shapley 's estimate , contains 100,000 million stars , rotates one revolution every 300 million years -- a vast pivoting mass of incandescent bodies , whose outer rim moves at a speed of thousands of miles a second .
This rotating disk of stars has turned but several times since the earth was born .
What purpose , we may inquire , do such motions serve in the life of man , the so - called " end-all " and objective of existence ?
And how can we see in any such movements the earmarks of " design " ?
A moving mass that gets itself nowhere except where it was before , which takes unthinkable ages to complete an entire circle , and knows not why it moves , is undoubtedly moving by potentialities resident in the original nebulae from which these bodies were born .
The familiar rate of speed at which light travels , 186,000 miles a second ( which is , incidentally , about a million times the speed of sound ) , gives us a faint but impressive picture of stellar distances .
A star is said to be so many " light - years " away -- this meaning the number of years light must travel from that particular star to reach our planet .
The nearest fixed star -- Proxima Centauri -- happens to be 4 1/4 " light - years " away , so we can see how far our nearest stellar neighbor is removed from our little earth .
Four and a quarter years ago the light by which we see Proxima Centauri left this star for its journey through space .
The nearest rim of stars is about a million times more distant from the earth than the nearest planet .
Venus , our next - door planetary neighbor , never comes closer than 26,000,000 miles to earth .
Proxima Cdntauri , the nearest star , is approximately a million times more distant , or , to be a little more exact , 25,000,000 million miles .
It is difficult to visualize in these figures the full significance of our petty position in space and the futility of terrestrial existence and life when measured in terms of stellar depths .
Let us take a still further jaunt into space .
Far beyond Proxima Centauri , past a series of star - cluster 's and solitary orbs , through a veritable wilderness of worlds and empty deserts of space , lie the remote -- the extremely remote -- extra - galactic nebulae .
" The most distant of them , " writes Jeans , [ The Universe Around Us , p. 69 . ] " is about 140 million light - years from us . "
It is the furthermost point the human eye has seen .
The light which reaches us today from these very remote regions of space started on its lightning - like journey millions of years before Joshua is said to have made the sun stand still , or Jesus is reputed to have ascended into heaven .
[ A " light - year " is about 6,000,000,000,000 miles , so that any one who cares to may calculate the distance which Jesus had to travel in order to reach the nearest fixed star in his " ascension ' into heaven ]
Indeed , it is certain that the early ancestor of Joshua and Jesus -- the ape - man , Pithecanthropus Erectus -- had not yet been born .
In fact , the very earth had not even given birth to the Thunder Reptile and the mighty Tyrannosaurs .
It was long before the coming of the Dinosaurs , when God preferred the company of reptiles to that of men .
[ According to Lucas ( Am. Mus. of Nat. Hist. Guide Leaflet No. 70 ) , the Dinosaurs first appeared on the earth " some 35,000,000 years ago . "
At that time , the light by which we now see the extra- galactic nebulae had already traveled over 100 million years . ]
Every schoolboy knows that the stars are much older than the earth , and that our little globe is a mere infant in point of time .
It was , relatively speaking , born only yesterday , while the life of the stars may be measured in figures which stagger the imagination .
" Time , " as Jeans reminds us , [ The Universe Around Us , p. 81 . ]
" leaves its mark , its wrinkles and its grey hairs , on the stars , so that we can guess their ages tolerably well , and the evidence is all in favor of stellar lives , not of thousands of millions , but of millions of millions , of years . "
Our earth is probably not more than 2,000 million years old , [ This is Jeah 's figure .
Charles Schuchert , professor of paleontology , Yale University , states : " No geologist today thinks that the evolution of the earth and its life could have taken place in less than 100,000,000 years .
My own view as a student of historical geology is that geologic time endured about 800,000,000 years . "
The earth is , cosmologically considered , very young . ]
a mere nothing in point of time when compared to the life of the stars .
The Jewish cosmologists who wrote their astronomy in days of pious ignorance , and handed it along in the form of sacred literature and as divinely inspired , failed utterly to grasp the natural sequence of events .
According to the so - called Mosaic account of " creation , " the earth was made before the sun ; the stars were a mere afterthought to the " creation " of the earth .
" He made the stars also " is as little valid in astronomy today as the story of the fairy godmother in Cinderella , who turned a pumpkin into a coach , is valid in chemistry .
Stars were not " made " by a Jewish Magician , nor is there any " he " involved in their development : they evolve , and their emergence from nebulous matter , by natural means , is wholly foreign to the pitiably - ignorant nursery tales hatched by religion .
The author of the article on " Genesis " in the Encyclopedia Britannica , Stanley Arthur Cook , does well in stating what all astronomers and geologists know , namely : " That the records of the pre-historic ages in Genesis I - XI are at complete variance with modern science and archaeological research is unquestionable . "
With these facts before us , we can dismiss , as altogether trivial , those teachings of religion which picture man as important in the life of the universe or the stars as mere by - products of existence .
" We can say , " writes Jeans , [ The Universe Around Us , p. 326 . ] " that the stars have existed as such for from 5 to 10 million million years , and that their atoms may have previously existed in nebulae for at least a comparable , and possibly for a much longer , time . "
" As a general rule , " writes Simon Newcomb , [ " Astrophysics , " Ency .
Brit . ]
" the incandescent heavenly bodies are not masses of solid or liquid matter , as formerly assumed , but mainly masses of gas , or of substances gaseous in their nature . "
The low density of the stars , due to their gaseous nature , is another decisive factor against any concept of life on the stars .
[ " In many stars the material is so inflated , " writes Eddington , " that it is more tenuous than the air around us ; for example , if you were inside Capella you would not notice the material of Capella any more than you notice the air in this room " ( Stars and Atoms , p. 31 . ) ]
The giant star Antares , with a diameter of 390,000,000 miles , is well suited in area for the maintenance of life on a tremendous scale , but it is so tenuous in structure that it may be compared almost to a huge vacuum .
This mammoth globe of rarefied gas is so large that the sun , to equal it in size , would have to expand to more than the diameter of the earth 's orbit around the sun .
Antares , in fact , occupies 90,000,000 times as much space as the sun , yet offers not a single square inch of surface as a foot - hold for life .
Of what use is such a globe , seeing that it cannot produce even a blade of grass ?
And it is but one of four mammoth stars , the others being the super - giants , Hercules , Ceti , and Betelgeux , all of which are gaseous and uninhabitable orbs .
Astronomers are thoroughly agreed as to the origin of the stars .
The primeval chaos , or nebular mist , out of which these huge bodies evolved , must have been of extremely low density , since all the matter now observable in the stars , if scattered evenly throughout the known areas of space reached by the telescope , would form only a thin veil of unthinkable rarity .
This attenuated mass of matter , representing the " batter " of future worlds , was the substance out of which all things evolved .
Here again we are confronted with the great emptiness of space , in which all the matter of the universe would then be spread out in a thin cloud of star - mist .
This gossamer mist would then be so thin that the molecules in it , according to Jeans , would be from two to three yards apart !
How thinly these molecules would be scattered may be judged by comparing them with the compactness of the molecules in air , which , on the average , are about an eight - millionth of an inch apart .
It is futile , therefore , for the theist to think of the stars as possible abodes of life .
They are terrifically hot bodies -- hotter , in general , than anything we can experience on earth , or of which we can conceive .
Stars range from as low as the temperature of an ordinary coal fire ( one may place one 's hand in the open grate if he wants to know how hot this is ) up to 28,000 degrees , the estimated temperature of Plackett 's Star .
Obviously , life Cannot exist under these thermal conditions ; and when we consider the vast number of stars in the galactic system , computed by Sears as 30,000 million and by Eddington as 300,000 million , we can see the utter futility of these " burning " globes , as far as life is related to stellar activity .
A GREAT landmark was reached when Pierre Laplace , in 1796 , published his Systeme du Monde .
In this he set forth his famous nebular hypothesis , in which the birth of stars and planets was traced to a rotating nebula -- an hypothesis , by the way , which entirely dispensed with God .
The nebular hypothesis of Laplace has been largely augmented or modified , rather than entirely superseded , by subsequent observation ; yet to the great French astronomer is due the formation of a theory which still holds good in part , and which accounts for the formation of stars .
" Apart from minor details , " writes Jeans , [ The Universe Around Us. p. 231 . ] " the process imagined by Laplace explains the birth of suns out of nebulae ; it cannot explain the birth of planets out of suns . "
This is because the sequence of events in the development of planets is distinct from that formulated by Laplace in respect to suns .
Nevertheless , he was the Darwin of the skies , who first , in a masterly way and with a grasp of mathematics which far transcended that of many of his contemporaries , traced the evolution of heavenly bodies from a simple and widely - diffused mist , or nebula , in a state of rotation , up to the giant constellations and colossal star systems we see today .
His theory , which still forms the basic outline of present - day cosmological development , falls short of explaining the origin of planets from a sun , and here we come to the tidal theory postulated by Jeans , which will be considered in due course .
Whatever particular process heavenly bodies pursued in their evolution from nebulae up to mighty constellations , one thing is tolerably certain .
Stars came into existence , not at the command of a ghost , nor by a few words spoken in Hebrew , but by a process of slow condensation in the primeval chaos , consuming many billions of years .
The same process may be witnessed today in what are called rotating nebulae , of which many millions exist , and is recorded on photographic plates .
" These photographs , " says Jeans , [ The Universe Around Us , p. 230 . ]
" exhibit a process taking place before our eyes , which is essentially identical with that imagined by Laplace , except for a colossal difference of scale .
Everything happens qualitatively as Laplace imagined , but on a scale incomparably grander than he ever dreamed of .
In these photographs the primitive nebula is not a single sun in the making ; it contains substance sufficient to form hundreds of millions of suns ; the condensations do not form puny planets the size of our earth , but are themselves suns . "
This is what we witness today , and it is in deadly conflict with the theory of creation as pictured in the Bible .
Nor is there , in any concept of cosmic evolution , any need of postulating a ghostly finger twirling the stars , or starting them spinning in their orbits .
No initial push , no divine " shove " is required even in the earliest stages of stellar evolution .
As Jeans points out , [ The Universe Around Us , p. 214 . ]
" Stars , as soon as they come into being , are endowed with rotations transmitted to them by their parent nebula , in addition to the rotations resulting from the currents set up in the process of condensation . "
From chaos to nebulae , from nebulae to stars , and from stars to planets and satellites , a steady procession of natural events occurs , unattended by deities or demons .
Stars move , not because of some heavenly hand , but because of what is known as the " conservation of angular momentum . "
This means , as Jeans explains , [ Ibid. , p. 214. ] that " rotation , like energy , cannot entirely disappear .
Its total amount is conserved , so that when a nebulae breaks up into stars , the original rotation of the nebula must be conserved in the rotations of the stars . "
And this rotary movement is traceable to nothing more supernatural than " the existence of currents in the primordial medium " which " endow the resulting nebulae with varying amounts of rotation . "
Hence , by the inherent properties of motion , with which matter is endowed , the entire fabric of the universe is woven , and continues in a state of motion .
There is no time thinkable when matter was at rest , or without the property of motion or of changing its position in space , whether in the form of giant stars whirling through space at a thousand times the speed of an express train or of a molecule of air traversing a tiny space at 500 yards a second , the approximate speed of a rifle bullet .
Matter in motion is eternal : the vision of " dead , " inert , or motionless matter stirred to sudden activity by a ghost belongs to the age of fables .
Unquestionably , motion is as much a quality or an attribute of matter as form and extension , and is as inseparable from it as either of these are from the basic substratum we call matter .
Those , therefore , who , in the interest of theism , insist that there must have been a time when matter was not endowed with motion , do not even understand the law of probability .
There is no more reason to suppose a time when matter was at rest , as a time when matter did not possess the attributes of form and extension .
Motion is as old as matter itself , and matter is as old as time .
That matter was " originally " a dead , inert mass , incapable of motion , and received its " first impetus " from some external agency , usually thought to be intelligent , rests upon not a jot of evidence .
Even the nebula from which the stars came , rare and extended as it was , must have been moved by inherent properties of its own , quite the same as matter moves to - day , without the shadow of aid from anything outside itself .
" There is no difficulty , " writes Sir Robert S. Ball , [ Article " Nebular Theory , " Ency .
Brit . ]
Director of the Cambridge Observatory , " in conceiving how a nebula , quite independently of any internal motion of its parts , shall also have had as a whole a movement of rotation .
In fact a little consideration of the theory of probabilities will show it to be infinitely probable that such an object should really have some movement of rotation , no matter by what causes the nebula may have originated .
As this vast mass cooled it must by the laws of heat have contracted towards the center , and as it contracted it must , according to the law of dynamics , rotate more rapidly . "
The inherent property of matter observed in the law of gravitation -- by which every particle of matter attracts every other particle inversely as the square of the distance -- is the fundamental keystone of physical astronomy .
On it is based the entire fabric of the heavens .
The development of stars and sun , and their suspension and movements in space rest on nothing more complicated than this simple physical property of matter , which extends from the atoms in a tiny speck of dust to mighty stars weighing millions of millions of tons .
The universal " law , " discovered by Newton is apparent throughout the heavens as in the world of the microscope .
The wonderment which the savage or the theologian might feel in seeing heavenly bodies " hanging on nothing " or suspended midway in the sky loses its glamour once the principle of gravitation is understood .
The " suspension " of bodies in a medium lighter than themselves , and traveling through space at the tremendous speed of 18 miles a second , may be readily grasped once , we arrive at a clear understanding of the agency responsible for the phenomenon .
We are held to the earth , and the earth is held to the sun by this property of matter ; and the moon travels about the earth and is held from a headlong plunge into space by the earth 's attraction .
" There is not the slightest doubt , " says Jeans , [ The Universe Around Us , pp.. 157 , 158 . ] " as to what determines the motions of the stars ; it is the law of gravitation , every star attracting every other star with a force which varies inversely as the square of their distance apart ... the mere law of gravitation , together with the supposition that the stars cannot exercise free - will as to whether they obey it or not , are enough . "
In a word , these moving orbs are not following an intelligent command , but are moving by inner properties of their own , in response to the iron urge of physical attraction .
MOST persons think of orbits as " nicely - planned " paths which have been " properly spaced " apart , in order that moving bodies may travel in " safety " .
For billions of years celestial bodies have been moving in ever - changing orbits , many of which , through the vast interplay of gravitational hold of one body on another , have led to countless collisions and the elimination of bodies .
Orbits which now remain and which excite so much admiration and wonder in the eyes of the theist , on account of their " proper placing " in the heavens , are merely those which have survived the long play of time -- orbits which were distant enough , and sufficiently isolated , not to conflict or interfere with one another .
The natural elimination of intersecting orbits has resulted in preserving those bodies whose orbits have not crossed .
It is easy to see that orbits were never " planned " , because an elliptical course is the least safe of paths , and it is this irregularity which causes most collisions in the heavens .
A circular or nearly circular orbit is " safer " for a moving body to travel in than elliptical orbit of large eccentricity , and most orbits are of the latter type .
If there were " intelligence " behind the universe , all orbits would have been circular .
" If all the orbits were nearly circular , " remarks Rolling T. Chamberlain , [ " The Origin and Early Stages of the Earth , " in The Nature of the World and of Man , p. 37 . ]
" only a few of the separate bodies moving in them would come into collision with one another .
But since the orbits are ellipses , differing much in shape and dimensions , many of the particles have opportunities of collision . "
Those who admire " nicely placed " orbits are simply looking at those of which the natural spacing apart has preserved them from destruction and extinction ; the others have gone to the scrap - heap .
Our universe , as theistically conceived , is a wound - up piece of mechanism , " made in the beginning " to go on forever or by an occasional re-winding or adjustment of its parts .
God is ever on hand to give the stars and planets a fresh push if they lag in their orbits , or restore them to their courses if they get out of line and wander from their " appointed paths " .
It is a god - sized job , but quite easy for one who has been at it for billions of years .
All the talk of a supreme intelligence or " mind " planning the orbits of the stars and then sitting back and watching them follow their prescribed courses is idle chatter to the ears of the scientist .
There are no settled courses , no " fixed " orbits for stars ; and what seems a non-varying course is , in reality , subject to the universal law of eternal change .
Stars move in ever - changing orbits due to their ceaseless loss of weight through radiation and to the ever - changing " hold " which one body exerts on another .
It is not likely that a star ever actually returns to the same position in space it occupied before , due to the continuous shift of heavenly bodies , both in respect to individual and mass movements and complex interplay of gravitational pull between bodies .
As a matter of fact , our universe is fast thinning out , spreading itself out into interstellar space .
Permanent orbits do not exist .
Nor can we , under any consideration , regard the stars and planets , as we see them today , as individually etemal .
The matter of which they are composed will endure , but in different forms and in different expressions of energy .
The universe is slowly " running down , " exhausting itself by its tremendous outpouring of energy through radiation .
There is no replacement of stellar energy , and while all matter that now exists will continue to exist in one form or another , its powers will have been spent like so much water which , having run over a mill wheel , lies dormant in the pond .
Such is Jean 's picture of the ultimate fate of the universe of stars .
" We are left with a dead , although possibly a warm , universe -- a ' heat - death ' " , says Jeans .
[ The Universe Around Us , p. 320 . ]
And while the conservation of energy is a fundamental axiom of science , it does not mean that energy cannot so alter its forms of activity that it will not cease to exist in a particular form .
One thing is certain .
Sun and stars cannot go on radiating energy and reducing as they do now without coming to the end of their individual existence .
Eventually they must consume their entire substance by dissipation and the expenditure of their latent powers .
Their energies will have then become scattered through space , and stars themselves will have then been absorbed in the vast tide of what Shapley calls the universal Drift .
Man sees " fixity " and " permanency " in the stars only because his own life is so brief , because his existence , measured by the stars , is a mere blink in the darkness , a feeble flash in an eternity of time .
Were he able to extend his span of life to a few billion years he would realize that the apparent " unchangeable order " and " arrangement " of the universe is a matter of never - ending change , and that there is going on continuous revolutions in the form , structure , and positions of heavenly bodies .
" As eternal as the stars " is a relative rather than an actual description , since we know , as well as we know anything , that stars are born to die , Nowhere is there an exception to the universal law of formation and annihilation , birth and extinction .
It has been argued by the theist that the heavenly bodies are so nicely " guided " in space that they never collide ; that their orbits are so " laid out " that each star keeps its appointed distance from all the others ; that , in a word , we are confronted with the evidence of a " directing " agency keeping the stars in their courses .
This confounding of the situation arising from the failure to note that the present " order " of motion in the system has been reached only after the greatest " disorder " and counter - play of opposing forces ; bodies which have collided or been absorbed by others , or whose motions were counter to the general trend of motion are now no longer present or felt in the main tide of dominant motion ; billions of years have eliminated the weaker modes of motion .
The struggle for existence in the heavens , from nebulae to stars , and from stars to planets , is quite as deadly as anywhere else , and on a far more colossal scale .
The survival of the fittest exists in the heavens as well as on earth .
Even after the lapse of unspeakable billions of years , we are confronted with the evidence of innumerable catastrophes in the skies : catastrophes which upset every vestige of an " Ordained " order of motion and movement .
We have with us today the tell - ale wreckage of " burst " stars , " mashed " planets and satellites , and the daily " annihilation " of heavenly bodies .
There is , on physical ground alone , nothing surprising in the fact that stars rarely collide -- there are so few of them in space .
And they are so thinly scattered , that the chance of their colliding or of even closely approaching each other is practically nil .
If every star were reduced by scale to the size of a grain of dust , the distance between each one and its nearest neighbor would average 80 miles .
The chance of stellar collision under these circumstances is at once apparent .
It is because they are separated by such vast distances , and not because a celestial mind directs them where to go , that stars move in relative safety ,
The picture of these celestial bodies being pushed about by angels , under the watchful eye of an unseen being , is medieval nonsense .
The wonder is , not that the stars do not frequently collide , but that they ever do .
Yet collisions do occasionally occur , in spite of the vast distances between the stars .
The number of collisions is of course relatively small , but just what one might expect in the nature of the case .
[ " Calculation shows that any one star may expect to move for something of the order of a million million million years before colliding with a second star . " -- Jeans , The Universe Around Us , p. 88 . ]
And it is only by the " side - wiping " or grazing of two stars that planets are born .
if it be urged by the theist that stars were thus " wisely " distributed at great distances apart , " in order " that they may not collide , it can be shown that this arrangement is a direct hindrance to the birth of planets .
Planets ( as we shall see later ) come into existence only by the near approach of two stars , and stars , as Jeans points out , [ The Universe Around Us , p. 332 . ] " are so sparsely scattered in space that it is an inconceivably rare event for one to pass near to a neighbor . "
As a consequence , planets are exceedingly rare , for the precise reason that the chance of two stars meeting in space is so prevented by distance .
The " arrangement " is bad for the production of planets .
NOTHING is more certain than that the stars are lifeless globes ,
It is as unthinkable that any of them should be inhabited as that our own sun -- a blazing cauldron of heat -- should have human beings living upon it .
Life in the universe is as nothing at all .
Even in our own planetary system , tiny as it is , life is of less than pin-point significance .
Of the nine planets of our system only one bears life , and that planet is among the " minor " or smaller members of the group .
The larger planets , with surface areas many times that of the earth , are known to be lifeless orbs .
If a mentality had anything to do with the formation of the solar system with a view to producing life , it is a mentality of a very low order .
It is as though a theatrical producer or showman were to build a stage as large as the American continent to exhibit a few fleas .
Jupiter , the largest planet of our system , is about twice as massive as all the other planets put together .
Yet it is devoid of life .
With a diameter about eleven times that of the earth , its surface area is far more extensive than that of our little globe , and it offers itself , in point of size , as the most suitable of planets for the production of life on an enormous scale .
But the " divine designer " behind it all forgot to make the planet solid enough : its density is not far from that of water .
And he forgot to put this giant body close enough to the sun to keep its surface warm .
From a God - believer 's viewpoint the arrangement is unfortunate .
The same for Saturn , the second planet of our system in point of size , which is five times as large as all the other planets , excepting Jupiter , put together .
It is of very slight density : its barrenness cannot be questioned .
Its tenuity is particularly , striking when we consider that Titan itself , a mere satellite of Saturn , has greater density than the huge planet around which it revolves .
It is better conditioned for life , in the matter of density and solidity , than its mother planet .
But Titan is small and much colder than the moon .
Obviously , these striking mal - arrangements cannot be reconciled with the idea that the universe was " made " for life ; life is a mere incidental and trifling occurrence : an occurrence which has not been prearranged or led up to by intelligent means , but which has been introduced only at one point among billions of barren orbs .
Planets are rare exceptions in the life of the stars ; an inhabited planet is a rare exception in the life of the planets , and our earth is a solitary exception among trillions of lifeless orbs .
The universe , as a totality , is almost a lifeless affair .
What life it has borders on zero .
There is nothing here that reflects a means to an end .
Even though it could be proved that all the planets of the solar system were inhabited , it would weigh as nothing against the billions of uninhabited stars : life in the universe would still constitute but an infinitesimal part of the whole .
Life , in any event , shrinks to microscopic proportions , and is like a grain of dust in a great desert sandstorm .
The barrenness of this wilderness of worlds is only too apparent to the student of astronomy .
" Apart from the certain knowledge , " writes Jeans , [ The Universe Around Us , p. 335 . ] " that life exists on earth , we have no definite knowledge whatever except that , at the best , life must be limited to a tiny fraction of the universe .
Millions of millions of stars exist which support no life , which have never done so and never will do so .
Of the rare planetary system in the sky , many must be entirely lifeless , and in others life , if it exists at all , is probably limited to a few planets . "
How the God - believer would rejoice if he could point to 300,000 million inhabited worlds !
How he would argue that life on them showed the " wisdom " and forethought of the Creator , in thus populating the universe !
Instead , the facts are all against him : he is left with a universe composed largely of 300,000 million lifeless orbs .
What " purpose " can he assign to these dead worlds ?
" The old view that every point of light in the sky represented a possible home for life is quite foreign to modern astronomy , " says Jeans .
[ The Universe Around Us , p. 331 . ]
" The stars themselves have surface temperatures ranging from 1650 degrees to 30,000 degrees or more , and are of course at far higher temperatures inside .
By far the greater part of the matter of the universe is at a temperature of millions of degrees , so that its molecules are broken up into atoms , and the atoms are broken up , partially at least , into their constituent parts .
Now the very concept of life implies duration in time ; there can be no life where atoms change their make - up millions of times a second and no pair of atoms can ever stay joined together . "
It is only by forgetting his place in stellar space that man can find the urge to continue his interest in things here below , for all his labors on earth are destined to be wiped out in the crash of things .
Indeed , the picture drawn by the astronomer is of worlds growing , developing , and decaying before our eyes .
Nothing is permanent , nothing eternal in the celestial Drift but the star - dust from which man came .
[ So ludicrous is the idea that man survives death , or lives on in a conscious state by " going to heaven , " that it is well to quote here a few lines from Sir John Lubbock , Origin of Civilization and the Primitive Condition of Man , pp. 245 , 246 : " A friend of Mr. Lang tried long and patiently to make a very intelligent , docile Australian black understand his existence without a body , but the black never could keep his countenance and generally made an excuse to get away .
One day the teacher watched and found that he went to have a hearty fit of laughter at the absurdity of the idea of a man living and going about without arms , legs , or mouth to eat ; for a long time he could not believe that the gentleman was serious , and when he did realize it , the more serious the teacher was the more ludicrous the whole affair appeared to the black . "
Elie Metchnikoff , past director of the Pasteur Institute in Paris , soberly remarks : " The idea of a future life is supported by not a single fact , while there is much evidence against it .
...
It is easy to see why the advance of knowledge has diminished the number of believers in the persistence of consciousness after death , and that complete annihilation at death is the conception accepted by the vast majority of enlightened persons . "
( The Nature of Man , p. 161 . ) ]
And while the tide of time rolls on :
" The stars shall fade away , the sun
Himself grow dim with age , and nature sink
In years . " -- ADDISON .
Regardless of crumbling worlds , no one who believes in personal extinction need lack a proper incentive for life .
In spite of the fact that he does not expect to live again , Mr. H.G.
Wells goes on working more steadily than some who believe that they will receive manifold blessings in the sky .
Few have done more than Wells for the entertainment and enlightenment of his fellow beings , yet , says he , [ First and Lost Things , p. 110 . ]
" I do not believe I have any personal immortality . "
He simply takes the common - sense viewpoint of many if the world 's benefactors from Democritus and Lucretius to Burbank and Edison .
Nor will men who are men fail to conduct themselves decently because neither they nor the stars can live forever , or because there is no place of future rewards and punishments .
Nobility of character can suffer nothing from a realization of facts .
As Karl Vogt remarks , [ Lectures on Man , p. 469 . ]
" There are priests who , while defrauding the state of taxes , mount the pulpit and preach that when materialists and Darwinists do not commit all sorts of crimes , it is not from righteousness but from hypocrisy .
Let them rage !
They require the fear of punishment , the hope of reward in a dreamt - of beyond , to keep in the right path -- for us suffices the consciousness of being men amongst men . "
A star journeying through space casually overtook the sun , not indeed colliding with it , but approaching so close as to raise a great tidal wave .
By this disturbance jets of matter spurted out of the sun ; being carried round by their angular momentum they did not fall back again but condensed into small globes -- the planets .
-- Sir ARTHUR S. EDDINGTON .
[ The Nature of the Physical World , p. 176 . ]
We know of no type of astronomical body in which the conditions can be favorable to life except planets like our own revolving round a sun .
...
Only an infinitesimally small corner of the universe can be in the least suited to form an abode of life .
-- Sir JAMES JEANS .
[ The Universe Around Us , pp. 332 , 333 . ]
If matter exists in the universe for the purpose of life , nature would seem to tip a hogshead to fill a wine - glass , when it makes life possible only on a little planet .
-- Sir JOHN HERSCHEL . [ W.H. Thomson 's Some Wonders of Biology , p. 176 . ]
If the sun were created expressly to light and heat the earth , what a waste of energy !

[ " Astronomy , " The Nature of the World and of Man , p. 17 . ]
The solar system is not the typical product of development of a star ; it is not even a common variety of development ; it is a freak .
-- Sir ARTHUR S. EDDINGTON .
[ Swarthmore Lecture , 1929 , Science and the Unseen World , p. 12 . ]
WHOEVER has sunned oneself at the seashore or basked under the intense glare of a tropical sky is probably willing to admit that our solar orb is hot .
Yet it is not long ago that a religiously - minded scientist thought that the sun might be an inhabited body , in much the same way as some persons today imagine the stars are inhabited worlds .
" But little more than a century ago , " writes Archibald Henderson , " a distinguished astronomer , William Herschel , actually believed it possible that the sun might be a habitable planet ! "
A close scrutiny of the sun helps us to understand not only the nature of this star , which is the one nearest the earth , but the constitution and make - up of many other stars in general .
From our study of the sun we can picture the impossibility of life on a star .
Although the sun is nearly 93,000,000 miles from the earth , it is a quarter of a million times nearer to us than any other star ; it has therefore been photographed to better advantage than any of the others ; its " close - ups " reveal something more tangible than mere points of light .
In dealing with the sun we are dealing with a body which is nearer to us than some of the planets and whose size transcends them all .
It is the brightest and most conspicuous of all celestial objects .
Photographs of the sun reveal a stupendous mass of incandescent matter in a high state of agitation , pitted with great cavernous openings into any of which our little earth could be thrust and instantly consumed .
The time is past when the sun was thought to be inhabited .
It is now classed as a typical star , with a temperature at its surface of 10,000 deg .
F. Its absolute temperature is 6000 deg .
[ The sun 's surface temperature is relatively " luke - warm . "
The internal temperature is calculated by Emden and Eddington to be about 31,500,000 degrees ; by Jeans , 55,000,000 degrees . ]
Solar prominences , or giant jets of gas , shoot up like mountainous flame of fire from its surface .
The average altitude of these tongues of gas is thought to be 20,000 miles .
Yet , on occasion , they reach far greater heights ; we are told by R.A. Sampson , [ Article " Sun , " Ency .
Brit . ]
Astronomer Royal for Scotland , that " Young records one which reached an elevation of 350,000 miles . "
This altitude is a distance equal to over 43 times the diameter of the earth .
The surface of the sun is in a continuous state of convulsion due to these eruptive prominences and its boiling seas of gas .
The poet Dante could well have pictured his Inferno on the sun .
The sun has been computed by Jeans to be about 8 million million years old .
About 7,600,000,000,000 years ago ( the figure is not fanciful , but is derived from a mathematical calculation based on solar radiation ) our sun could have weighed a hundred times what it does now .
It has spent , in all these aeons of time , enough energy to light and heat a billion planets like our own , had its energy been intelligently directed .
But like other massive stars which " radiate away their energy , and therefore also their weight , with extraordinary rapidity " ( Jeans ) [ The Universe Around Us , p. 178 . ] the sun has been a celestial spendthrift .
Millions upon millions of tons of solar energy are poured daily into desert space , and wasted in the yawning abyss of outer darkness and cold , when they could well be distributed to nearby planets .
[ " The amount of the sun 's heat has been estimated , " says Sir Robert S. Ball , " but we receive on the earth less than one two - thousand - millionth part of the whole radiation . "
( " Nebular Theory , " Ency . Brit . ) .
And as Proctor observes in his Our Place Among Infinities , " all the planets together receive less than 230 millionth part ; the rest is seemingly scattered uselessly through interstellar depth . " ]
" Our own sun , which is a star , " writes Harlow Shapley , [ The New York Times Magazine , Aug. 11 , 1929 . ]
" radiates away 360,000 million tons of energy every day , of which only 160 tons reach our planet . "
How much better it would be for our earth if a tiny fraction of this squandered heat were poured into the polar regions of our globe and less heat on the African and Mongolian deserts .
And how the outer planets of our system now intensely cold , might benefit from a proper distribution of solar radiation .
Naturally , such an expenditure of energy without a corresponding replacement cannot go on forever , and we must look to the time when the sun 's supply of heat and light will have become completely exhausted .
Far distant as that time may be , it is as certain as tomorrow 's sundown , and calls for the cessation of all earthly life .
Our solar system is slowly " running down " .
The energy of the sun is not being replaced from any source of power known to science , and the sun may be likened to a gigantic furnace into which the last shovelful of fuel was stored when it evolved from a primal fire - mist .
Glow it must until it has burned itself out and spent its last erg of energy in a wild debauch of cosmic recklessness and unbridled dissipation .
THERE is nothing in this ghastly waste of energy to suggest a Supreme Stoker or Chief Engineer .
Such misdirection as we see in the radiation of the sun does not reflect guidance , in any sense of the word , and would be regarded as criminal in an intelligent being .
The enormous shrinkage
In the weight of the sun naturally carries with it a corresponding reduction in the gravitational hold which this body exerts on the planets of our system , and all are slowly slipping from the sun .
As the hold diminishes , each planet moves a step further out into space .
Our own place in the system is in no way secure , and we are actually moving away from the sun at the rate of approximately three feet every hundred years .
Little as this may seem in point of terrestrial time , it spells disaster to the earth in the ticking of the cosmic clock .
No angel guides the planets nor holds them to " appointed paths " .
Nothing is " fixed " in the universe -- not even the orbit of the earth .
It is known with mathematical certainty that we are receding from the sun , due to the latter 's loss of weight by radiation and its diminishing hold on our own spinning globe .
As the sun loses weight at the rate of more than 4 million tons a second , its gravitational hold is rapidly decreasing , and we are each year headed , in an ever - increasing spiral course , toward the great , yawning abyss beyond .
While there is no immediate danger of our being swept into oblivion , the time will arrive when all earthly things will be doomed to perish , when the earth will be too cold to sustain life , and the finest of human thoughts will have been lost forever .
Then our earth , like all things else , will have joined the billions of lifeless globes .
No one can assign the slightest reason for the rotation of the sun .
By turning on its axis it cannot have " days " and " nights " like the earth , nor can its sidereal motion in space mean anything to the retinue of planets traveling with it .
Whether we ever reach the remote region in space toward which the sun is headed is of no moment to the inhabitants of the earth : our earth will carry on it nothing but the frozen remains of what were once living beings .
By means of spectral analysis we are able to determine the chemical constitution of the sun as accurately as if this huge globe had been lifted bodily into a gigantic laboratory and examined in a test - tube .
Each element in a gaseous state emits its o

Ohio sec. of state hit by death threats , cyberattacks David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday October 23 , 2008

This A GOP attempt to force as many as 200,000 newly - registered voters in Ohio to cast provisional ballots was rejected last week by the US Supreme Court .
Since then , reports CNN's John Roberts , things in Ohio have gotten " downright nasty . "
Roberts spoke with Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner , who has had her official state website hacked and has even been receiving death threats .
A Monday press release from Brunner 's office stated , " In recent weeks , phone lines and e-mail channels have been barraged , even in the business filings section of the office , with menacing messages and even threats of harm or death .
Last week , a suspicious package covered with threatening messages and containing an unidentified powder was mailed to the Secretary of State 's office via the previous location of the Client Services Center . "
" Veterans in my office ... said they 've never seen anything like this , " Brunner told Roberts .
" It 's very unfortunate .
It seems like there 's an effort to shake the confidence of voters . "
Roberts noted that even though the Supreme Court said Brunner is n't required to make the lists of new registrations available to the GOP for possible challenges at polling places , Republicans have continued pressing for her to turn them over voluntarily .
Deputy Ohio GOP Chairman Kevin DeWine charged , " She says she 's watching out for 200,000 people in Ohio .
I 'm watching out for the other 8.2 million who have the threat of their vote being discounted . "
" They brought this to us a month before the election , " Brunner told Roberts .
" If they had been really , really concerned about this , this would have been brought to our attention even last year . "
" I think what this is , is a way to segregate and pick off ballots in case it's a very close race , " continued Brunner .
" This is terribly unfortunate , because what they 've tried to do is inject fear into the process through these broad allegations of voter fraud , when actually what they 're trying to do here is intimidate voters . "
The Republican party has recently been accusing the anti-poverty group ACORN of massive voter registration fraud , with forms being handed in under such names as " Mickey Mouse . "
However , Brunner was emphatic that even if such allegations were correct , the state has a strong record of monitoring its own voter databases .
" We will not tolerate voter registration fraud in Ohio , " Brunner stated , describing the stae 's " multi- layered system " for checking registrations and weeding out duplicates .
" What we 've seen historically is that very seldom does voter registration fraud ever lead to illegal voting . "

Last week I spoke to a standing - room - only crowd of students and faculty about the current economic and financial turmoil .
I shared the podium with three of my colleagues , who range all the way from far to the left of Barack Obama to very , very far to the left of Barack Obama .
Needless to say , they all blamed , to a greater or an even greater degree , “ the free market . ”
Now , I do think it ’s possible in principle for wide - spread mal - investments to occur in an unfettered market .
( F.A . Hayek writes about the possibility in his Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle , which you can read online here . )
But enormous speculative bubbles , of the sort we ’ve just witnessed in the housing market , are typically the result of government interventions and policies .
So in my talk on this highly complex issue I tried to make three points : ( 1 ) the immediate cause of the financial panic on Wall Street was the housing bubble with its sudden rise in mortgage defaults ; ( 2 ) the free market , which stands for minimal government and the absence of privilege or discrimination , did not create this bubble ; and ( 3 ) government ( and Fed ) policy and pressure did , by undermining lending standards across the board and pushing lending rates artificially low .
This blog has already referenced Russell Roberts ’s fine collection of blog posts on the problem , and if you ’re already familiar with the issues then obviously there will be nothing new here for you .
But I think it might be useful to have a list of “ names and dates ” that make the above case .
The following is not meant to be exhaustive ( e.g. , it does n’t even mention important international factors ) , but is only an outline of the major legislation and policies relevant to the housing bubble .
( Caveat :
My expertise in economics is not in finance , but I did study a lot of this stuff at one time . )
***
LEGISLATIVE & POLICY TIMELINE
1913 : An act of Congress creates the Federal Reserve System , America ’s first true central bank , to act as the government ’s bank and as a lender - of - last resort for its members .
1920s : The Fed quickly discovers that by buying and selling Treasury obligations ( i.e. , “ open- market operations ” ) it can increase and decrease the supply of money and credit and thereby manipulate market rates of interest .
The Fed inflated the money supply by 60 % in the 20s , which resulted in economic boom as well as systemic malinvestment , and rampant speculation on margin on Wall Street .
( Sound familiar ? )
The best account of the episode is Murray Rothbard ’s America ’s Great Depression .
1929 - 33 : As we know , the economy then crashed and burned .
But that was a necessary stage in the economic recovery from the previous decade ’s massive malinvestments , as producers tried to re-align their decisions with consumer preferences .
Unfortunately , a slew of policies , such as the Fed ’s 30 % contraction of the money supply , and legislation , such as the Smoot - Hawley tariff , delayed recovery for twelve years .
1938 : FDR creates the Federal National Mortgage Association ( “ Fannie Mae ” ) , which is charged with buying and insuring residential mortgages in order to lower interest rates and promote home ownership .
Home ownership rises from 43 % in 1949 to 62 % in 1960 .
1970 : Congress creates the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( “ Freddie Mac ” ) that , together with a re-constituted Fannie Mae , bundles home mortgages into “ mortgage - backed securities ” ( MBSs ) for sale to investors .
• Fannie and Freddie are known as Government Supported Enterprises ( GSEs ) .
• By 2008 Fannie and Freddie had issued more than 60 % of MBSs , of which they themselves held $ 1 trillion and insure about 50 % of all MBSs .
• The perception that the federal government guarantees Fannie and Freddie ’s viability further lowers the cost of risk and increases their profit margin , on the order of about $ 2 billion per year , as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office and the Treasury Department .
• This implicit guarantee is realized in part , when beginning in 2006 rising loan defaults jeopardize Fannie and Freddie and prompts President Bush to nationalize them in August 2008 .
1975 : Congress passes the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act ( HMDA ) , requiring lenders to provide detailed information about mortgage applicants .
1977 : Jimmy Carter signs the Community Reinvestment Act ( CRA ) , requiring banks to conduct business across the entirety of geographic areas in which they operate , in an attempt to combat “ redlining . ”
1991 : Bill Clinton expands HMDA to include comparisons of rejection rates by race .
1992 : The Boston Fed promotes the government ’s mandate to increase home ownership , specifically among minorities , by advocating a relaxation of lending standards , including :
• Eliminating a lack of credit history as a barrier .
• Permitting a lower share of income than the standard ( 28/36 ) on mortgage payments .
• Permitting lower down payment and closing costs .
• Nontraditional sources of income are OK , including unemployment benefits .
• Banks can be punished by fines if HMDA data show higher rejection rates of minorities .
( One of my colleagues at this point accused me of blaming minorities for the housing crisis .
Be very careful , people will play this card !
Clearly , the responsibility for the crisis lies not in the intended beneficiaries of the CRA , but to the CRA itself and to the lax standards that it later encouraged across the entire mortgage market , both prime and sub- prime . )
Beginning in 1992 : Fannie and Freddie were encouraged to purchase “ affordable ” mortgages from banks – i.e. , mortgages that followed “ flexible lending standards ” to promote the goals of the CRA .
• Pressure from Congress and presidents Clinton and Bush helped promote the “ subprime ” market .
( Note : You could underwrite subprime paper even before deregulation of 1999 . )
• Congress and the Administration pressure Fannie & Freddie to accept a growing percentage of their portfolios in subprime mortgages and also MBSs , of which by 1992 they held over $ 1 trillion .
• Home ownership rises from around 64 % in 1994 to 69 % in 2005 .
From 1998 to 2006 : There ’s a great housing boom in the US .
Prices rise from just under $ 60 K to over $ 90 K ( in 1983 dollars ) , owing in large part to “ flexible standards ” and the Fed ’s interest - rate policy .
• The “ Federal Funds Rate , ” which the Fed targets by using open - market operations , plunged from around 6 % in January 2001 to 1 % in January 2004 .
• While this was largely in response to the recession and 9/11 , it also reinforced Congress and the President ’s goal of expanding home ownership and fueling the ongoing housing boom .
2006 : In the third quarter of that year , defaults and “ foreclosures started ” began their sudden climb for prime ( from around 0.16 % of loans made to 0.43 % in Q4 2007 ) and subprime mortgages ( from around 1.5 % to 3.7 % ) AT THE SAME TIME .
Thus , contrary to conventional wisdom , subprime defaults did not precipitate the prime - market defaults .
• Stan Liebowitz shows that it was in the market for adjustable - rate loans , particularly in low - income areas , that foreclosures were the most dramatic .
These are the kind of loans that speculators prefer because of their low initial rates ( with low or no money down owing to the “ flexible standards ” which were becoming the practice across the industry ) and because speculators expect to re-sell ( or “ flip ” ) the houses before the rates were set to increase .
• In percentage terms , the increase in foreclosure rates was significantly higher for prime adjustable loans ( 69 % ) than for subprime adjustable loans ( 39 % ) .
2008 : Investment banks and other financial institutions that , after years of encouragment from the government and GSEs , hold a significant part of their assets in MBS with defaulting loans — such as Bear Stearns , Lehman , AIG , Fannie and Freddie — see their asset values plummet and go belly up .
Panic races across the rest of the Wall Street , the Dow Jones crashes again and again .
In the midst of the panic , the government nationalizes a significant and ever growing percentage of the financial market .
So here ’s the short version : ( 1 ) Government legislates and the Fed helps to implement flexible standards in the mortgage industry in conformity with the CRA .
( 2 ) Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s , government pressures Fannie and Freddie to purchase an increasing proportion of MBSs and subprime loans ( based on flexible standards ) , while at the same time ( perhaps unintentionally ) loosening traditional lending standards across the board .
( 3 ) From 2001 to 2004 the Fed deliberately drives interest rates down ( as much as 5 percentage points ) .
( 4 ) This all fuels in a speculative housing boom beginning in 1998 , financial innovations on Wall Street based on MBSs and other derivatives in the early 2000s , and a housing bust in 2006 .
( 5 ) This in turn precipitates an historic financial collapse and equally historic bail - out in September 2008 .
Greed and speculation are obviously an integral part of this story .
( They are as constant as gravity in ANY politico - economic system . )
Given the scope and depth of involvement in it by government institutions and policies , however , blaming our current woes on “ the free market ” is nonsense .

A football referee was left lying unconscious on a pitch with a broken jaw after he sent a player off for violent conduct .
Ref Andy Parker had red-carded 20 - year - old Joe Preston during a game in Leicester when , it is alleged , the player ran back on to the pitch and punched him .
The St Andrews FC midfielder was swiftly suspended and police and the local Football Association ( FA ) branch are now investigating the incident , which happened at his club 's Canal Street ground on Saturday .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Parker , 50 , of Whitwick , Leicestershire , said : " I sent a person off for violent conduct and he 's taken exception to that .
He did n't like it .
I showed the red card , turned away and suddenly ' bump ' I am on the floor .
" I 've never seen anything like this in my life .
I am totally gobsmacked . "
The incident happened during the East Midlands Counties League match between St Andrews and Gedling Miners ' Welfare as the home side were 3 - 1 up .
The game was abandoned after 85 minutes .
St Andrews joint manager Darren Bradley said : " We do n't condone Joe 's actions and he will never play for the club again after this , but he is completely gutted and he can't believe what he did .
" I think the whole place was stunned .
The lad was genuinely distraught .
" He 's had a lot of pressure on his mind .
What I do know is that he 's taken himself to the doctor to get help with anger management . "
Mr Preston , of Thorpe Astley , had played with the club since junior level .
He told the Leicester Mercury he was ashamed of his conduct , saying : " The referee did n't deserve what happened to him .
I had no right to do what I did .
I am writing him a letter apologising for my action .
" I do n't think I could tell him face to face , as I am ashamed of myself .
He was just doing his job and I was completely out of order . "
Chris Parkin , football operations manager of Leicestershire and Rutland County FA , confirmed the player was the subject of an investigation by the body .

He said : " A player has allegedly struck a referee .
It 's been reported to us and we are following due process as laid down by the FA . "
He said the player had been suspended immediately and charged under FA regulations with assaulting a match official .
Such incidents are " thankfully extremely rare " , said an FA spokesman .
The association is trying to improve players ' behaviour towards match officials through its Respect campaign .
The spokesman said : " Every season there are a handful of very serious assaults in which the police get involved and they are completely unacceptable .
Anybody who attacks a referee in that way will be banned for life .
This is at the very extreme end .
" What we are concerned about is that referees are walking away from the game every season because the general conduct is poor towards them . "
Leicestershire Police confirmed a 20 - year - old man from Leicester had been arrested and bailed in connection with the incident in the city at the weekend .
Former 49ers quarterback Steve Young and his wife Barbara have posted yard signs in front of their Palo Alto home urging voters to vote no on Proposition 8 , the state ballot measure that would ban same - sex marriage .

The Mormon Church has donated much money to the " Yes on 8 " campaign .

Germany said on Sunday it would guarantee all private German bank accounts – currently worth € 568bn – in a dramatic move to prevent panic withdrawals as fears over the worldwide financial crisis spread to Europe ’s largest economy .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ We want to tell people that their savings are safe , ” Angela Merkel , chancellor , said at an unscheduled press conference on Sunday .
The scheme would cover existing accounts and others which savers might open .
German government officials also late on Sunday said the country ’s commercial banks had agreed to inject an extra € 15bn of liquidity into Hypo Real Estate , the ailing German mortgage and public sector lender , raising the bail - out agreed last week to € 50bn , the largest since the outbreak of the financial crisis .
The original rescue attempt had threatened to collapse after it emerged at the weekend that the full extent of Hypo ’s funding gap had not been disclosed .
Berlin ’s decision on savings – which followed controversial action by Ireland last week to guarantee the liabilities of six of its banks – will see the abolition of its current protection scheme , which guarantees 90 per cent of all bank deposits but only up to € 20,000 per account .

Arkansas already has three times as many children needing foster care and adoption than it has available families to take them in .
President Clinton spoke strongly against the amendment .
However , hate prevailed .
But conservatives mounted a grass - roots campaign , mainly through church groups , that framed the state ’s case - by - case approach to adoption requests as an affront to traditional family values .
" We believe that the best place for a child to grow up is in a stable home with a married mother and father , " said Jerry Cox , president of Family Council Action Committee , which obtained 95,000 signatures to place the proposal on state ballots .
" But we also believe in blunting a gay agenda that we see at work in other states with regard to marriage and adoption issues . "
This initiative was written because the Arkansas supreme court threw out a ban on fostering and adoption by gay couples in 2006 .
In 2006 , the court unanimously rejectedthe homophobic justifications for discrimination made by the Arkansas government .
Pointing to the findings of a lower court that overturned the ban , the Court criticized the Child Welfare Agency Review Board ’s reasons for enacting the regulation , writing , " These facts demonstrate that there is no correlation between the health , welfare , and safety of foster children and the blanket exclusion of any individual who is a homosexual or who resides in a household with a homosexual . "
The ACLU won the battle in 2006 .
The ACLU deserves our support .
The usage of the term " sexual partner outside of marriage " is particularly egregious because the state is put in the position of investigating the private lives of people who reside together .
I expect this initiative will be fought in the courts , but the ACLU has not indicated its position yet .
Here is the full text of the initiative .
All caps in the title are from the original text .

Obama advisers discuss preparations for war on Iran
By Peter Symonds
6 November 2008
On the eve of the US elections , the New York Times cautiously pointed on Monday to the emergence of a bipartisan consensus in Washington for an aggressive new strategy towards Iran .
While virtually nothing was said in the course of the election campaign , behind - the - scenes top advisers from the Obama and McCain camps have been discussing the rapid escalation of diplomatic pressure and punitive sanctions against Iran , backed by preparations for military strikes .
The article entitled “ New Beltway Debate : What to do about Iran ” noted with a degree of alarm : “ It is a frightening notion , but it not just the trigger - happy Bush administration discussing — if only theoretically — the possibility of military action to stop Iran ’s nuclear weapons program …
[ R] easonable people from both parties are examining the so - called military option , along with new diplomatic initiatives . ”
Behind the backs of American voters , top advisers for President - elect Barack Obama have been setting the stage for a dramatic escalation of confrontation with Iran as soon as the new administration takes office .
A report released in September from the Bipartisan Policy Center , a Washington - based think tank , argued that a nuclear weapons capable Iran was “ strategically untenable ” and detailed a robust approach , “ incorporating new diplomatic , economic and military tools in an integrated fashion ” .
A key member of the Center ’s task force was Obama ’s top Middle East adviser , Dennis Ross , who is well known for his hawkish views .
He backed the US invasion of Iraq and is closely associated with neo-cons such as Paul Wolfowitz .
Ross worked under Wolfowitz in the Carter and Reagan administrations before becoming the chief Middle East envoy under presidents Bush senior and Clinton .
After leaving the State Department in 2000 , he joined the right - wing , pro-Israel think tank — the Washington Institute for Near East Policy — and signed up as a foreign policy analyst for Fox News .
The Bipartisan Policy Center report insisted that time was short , declaring : “ Tehran ’s progress means that the next administration might have little time and fewer options to deal with this threat . ”
It rejected out - of - hand both Tehran ’s claims that its nuclear programs were for peaceful purposes , and the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate by US intelligence agencies which found that Iran had ended any nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
The report was critical of the Bush administration ’s failure to stop Iran ’s nuclear programs , but its strategy is essentially the same — limited inducements backed by harsher economic sanctions and the threat of war .
Its plan for consolidating international support is likewise premised on preemptive military action against Iran .
Russia , China and the European powers are all to be warned that their failure to accede to tough sanctions , including a provocative blockade on Iranian oil exports , will only increase the likelihood of war .
To underscore these warnings , the report proposed that the US would need to immediately boost its military presence in the Persian Gulf .
“ This should commence the first day the new president enters office , especially as the Islamic Republic and its proxies might seek to test the new administration .
It would involve pre-positioning US and allied forces , deploying additional aircraft carrier battle groups and minesweepers , [ and ] emplacing other war materiel in the region , ” it stated .
In language that closely parallels Bush ’s insistence that “ all options remain on the table ” , the report declared : “ We believe a military strike is a feasible option and must remain a last resort to retard Iran ’s nuclear program . ”
Such a military strike “ would have to target not only Iran ’s nuclear infrastructure , but also its conventional military infrastructure in order to suppress an Iranian response . ”
Significantly , the report was drafted by Michael Rubin , from the neo-conservative American Enterprise Institute , which was heavily involved in promoting the 2003 invasion of Iraq .
A number of Obama ’s senior Democratic advisers “ unanimously approved ” the document , including Dennis Ross , former senator Charles Robb , who co-chaired the task force , and Ashton Carter , who served as assistant secretary for defense under Clinton .
Carter and Ross also participated in writing a report for the bipartisan Center for a New American Security , published in September , which concluded that military action against Iran had to be “ an element of any true option ” .
While Ross examined the diplomatic options in detail , Carter laid out the “ military elements ” that had to underpin them , including a cost / benefit analysis of a US aerial bombardment of Iran .
Other senior Obama foreign policy and defense advisers have been closely involved in these discussions .
A statement entitled , “ Strengthening the Partnership : How to deepen US - Israel cooperation on the Iranian nuclear challenge ” , drafted in June by a Washington Institute for Near East Policy task force , recommended the next administration hold discussions with Israel over “ the entire range of policy options ” , including “ preventative military action ” .
Ross was a taskforce co-convener , and top Obama advisers Anthony Lake , Susan Rice and Richard Clarke all put their names to the document .
As the New York Times noted on Monday , Obama defense adviser Richard Danzig , former navy secretary under Clinton , attended a conference on the Middle East convened in September by the same pro-Israel think tank .
He told the audience that his candidate believed that a military attack on Iran was a “ terrible ” choice , but “ it may be that in some terrible world we will have to come to grips with such a terrible choice ” .
Richard Clarke , who was also present , declared that Obama was of the view that “ Tehran ’s growing influence must be curbed and that Iran ’s acquisition of a nuclear weapon is unacceptable . ”
While “ his first inclination is not to pull the trigger , ” Clarke stated , “ if circumstances required the use of military force , Obama would not hesitate . ”
While the New York Times article was muted and did not examine the reports too deeply , writer Carol Giacomo was clearly concerned at the parallels with the US invasion of Iraq .
After pointing out that “ the American public is largely unaware of this discussion , ” she declared : “ What makes me nervous is that ’s what happened in the run-up to the Iraq war . ”
Giacomo continued : “ Bush administration officials drove the discussion , but the cognoscenti were complicit .
The question was asked and answered in policy circles before most Americans know what was happening …
As a diplomatic correspondent for Reuters in those days , I feel some responsibility for not doing more to ensure that the calamitous decision to invade Iraq was more skeptically vetted . ”
The emerging consensus on Iran in US foreign policy circles again underscores the fact that the differences between Obama and McCain were purely tactical .
While millions of Americans voted for the Democratic candidate believing he would end the war in Iraq and address their pressing economic needs , powerful sections of the American elite swung behind him as a better vehicle to prosecute US economic and strategic interests in the Middle East and Central Asia — including the use of military force against Iran .
AQUAMAN WEEK continues here at Once Upon a Geek …
Today we ’re spotlighting some of my favorite Aquaman covers through the years .
As I mentioned on Monday , I did n’t start collecting Aquaman fanatically until 1990 .
However , I ’ve gone back and picked up just about every major appearance of the character since the early 1960s .
Here are a few of my favorite covers from all the various Aquaman series and appearances .
This Alan Davis drawing was used as the cover to Aquaman # 17 ( 2004 ) .
What an amazing piece !
The perspective is really striking and it truly demonstrates Aquaman ’s super - strength .
One of my all - time favorites .
Here is Aquaman ’s first appearance from More Fun Comics # 73 ( 1941 ) .
He did n’t get the cover since he was only a back - up feature .
Sorry for the size , it was the best image I could find of this page .
Notice that Aquaman ’s gloves are yellow .
They were yellow through pretty much the entire Golden Age and changed to green in the Silver Age .
If you want to see more of the splash pages from the Golden Age Aquaman stories ( or any Aquaman comic book cover ) , check out the fantastic Aquaman Cover Gallery .
What a great site !
Do n’t piss off Golden Age Aquaman … he ’ll throw a polar bear at your ass .
Seriously .
Here is the splash page from More Fun Comics # 85 ( 1942 ) .
Here is Aquaman ’s first solo appearance from Showcase # 30 ( 1961 ) .
Shortly after his try - out in Showcase , Aquaman graduated to his own comic .
Here is the cover to Aquaman # 1 ( 1962 ) .
Look out tadpole !
Not a special issue , but simply a cover that I like – Aquaman # 9 ( 1963 ) .
I think the sea horse and waves look cool .
The wedding of Aquaman and Mera in Aquaman # 18 ( 1964 ) .
One of my favorite covers from the original Aquaman series – Aquaman # 42 ( 1968 ) .
Very creative layout and lighting from the brilliant Nick Cardy !
I love this Nick Cardy cover – Aquaman # 56 ( 1971 ) !
It ’s so ridiculous that it ’s awe - to - the - sum !
This was actually the first Aquaman back - issue I purchased .
It also happens to be the last issue from the original series .
Adventure Comics # 452 ( 1977 ) .
This is the issue where Black Manta murders Aquaman ’s infant son .
I like the dual peril on this cover by the great Rick Buckler .
Nice way to show the dilemma .
Adventure Comics # 478 ( 1980 ) .
I ’m a real sucker for old plots that are dependent upon Aquaman ’s need for water every hour .
My favorite bits are when they actually clock his dependency .
As if he would automatically keel over at exactly 60 minutes without water .
Hysterical !
Here is Aquaman # 44 ( 1969 ) .
While the premise is ridiculous , the perspective , faces , word balloons , and lighting are amazing in this cover by Nick Cardy .
One of my favorites .
Another great example of using Aquaman ’s dependency on water as a plot device .
Check out the condensation coming off the pitcher !
Too funny !
Great Neal Adams cover here on Superman ’s Pal , Jimmy Olsen # 115 ( 1968 ) .
Team - ups !
Team -ups !
Team -ups !
Here is Brave and the Bold # 82 ( 1969 ) .
Check out that zombie look on Aquaman ’s face !
Brave and the Bold # 142 ( 1978 ) .
I ’m digging the telepathic circles !
World ’s Finest # 203 ( 1971 ) .
Great Neal Adams cover , but let ’s be honest about this …
If Superman lost his sight , would he really be this useless ?
And even so , would he really turn to Aquaman for help ?
You can always count on old - school fake - death stories to be fun .
Here is Aquaman ’s funeral from Aquaman # 30 ( 1966 ) .
I love that Metamorpho is a pall - bearer .
What the funk is that about ?
Another Aquaman death story , this time from Justice League of America # 122 ( 1975 ) .
Justice League of America Annual # 2 ( 1984 ) was important because in the story Aquaman officially disbanded the Justice League .
He then reformed a new League with several young heroes - in - training .
It was a neat concept , but sadly the “ Justice League Detroit ” era is not fondly remembered by many .
For me , it was the first time I collected JLA on a regular basis , so I love this era !
Just a nice cover of Aquaman and Mera from the “ Justice League Detroit ” era .
I love it when they frame the cover with the team faces !
Justice League of America # 242 ( 1985 ) .
The first appearance of the blue suit – Aquaman mini-series # 1 ( 1986 ) .
The second Aquaman mini-series # 1 ( 1989 ) .
David Devaje created a very interesting cover for this issue .
Atlantis Chronicles ( 1990 ) was an outstanding mini-series by Peter David that explored the mythical origins of Atlantis .
This series created the foundation for Atlantis that is still used today .
Beautiful art by Esteban Maroto .
A nice Kevin Maguire cover from the second Aquaman ongoing series – Aquaman # 3 ( 1992 ) .
Another Kevin Maguire piece as Aquaman gets his revenge on Black Manta for killing his son – Aquaman # 6 ( 1992 ) .
Aquaman # 0 ( 1994 ) from the third ongoing series drawn by Marty Egeland .
In the story by Peter David , Aquaman goes bat - sh!t crazy after losing his hand .
So what does he do ?
He shoves a harpoon into the pulpy - meaty stub of an arm that he ’s left with .
Niiiiiiiiiice .
The return of Mera in this yummy cover by Marty Egeland – Aquaman # 12 ( 1995 ) .
It ’s a shame she ’s always crazy .
Cool cover by Jim Calafiore during Peter David ’s tenure on the book – Aquaman # 17 ( 1996 ) .
Another great Marty Egeland cover – Aquaman # 23 ( 1996 ) .
This one features many of the superheroes with ties to Atlantis – ( L to R ) Tsunami , Aqualad , Aquaman , Power Girl ( at the time she was thought to have come from Atlantis ) , Arion , and Neptune Perkins .
One last great Marty Egeland cover – Aquaman # 24 ( 1996 ) .
I just love the spinning hook aimed right at the exposed throat .
Totally bad ass .
Justice Leagues : Justice League Atlantis ( 2001 ) .
Not a great comic , but a neat idea forming a JLA with members solely from Atlantis .
JLA # 75 ( 2003 ) – The conclusion of “ The Obsidian Age ” , subtitled “ The Hunt for Aquaman ” .
Nice imagery of Aquaman as a living water being .
Aquaman # 7 ( 2003 ) from the fourth ongoing Aquaman series .
DC tried to take this series in a magical direction , but it did n’t stick with the fans .
Regardless , cool swashbuckler - like cover from Yvel Guichet .
A nice heroic Aquaman by Howard Porter – Aquaman # 12 ( 2004 ) .
A return to a more traditional Aquaman look and story – Aquaman # 19 ( 2004 ) .
Great Silver
Age - like cover from Alan Davis !
I really enjoyed this particular run by Will Pfeifer .
I just thought this was a cool demonstration of what Aquaman could do with his water hand by Patrick Gleason – Aquaman # 29 ( 2005 ) .
A cool cover that symbolizes the storyline where Black Manta was using Aquaman ’s DNA against him .
Another cover by Patrick Gleason – Aquaman # 32 ( 2005 ) .
The issue that changed everything – Aquaman # 40 ( 2006 ) !
A new character took over the role of Aquaman in this Kurt Busiek - written issue .
This was the beginning of the Sword - and - Sorcery era .
Upon second reading , I really fell in love with these Busiek stories and Butch Guice ’s art was perfect .
This image was used on the cover of Aquaman # 54 ( 2007 ) .
An attractive piece featuring the new Aquaman by Terry Dodson & Rachel Dodson .
The new Aquaman schools the Man of Steel in this great cover by Shane Davis for Superman / Batman # 45 ( 2008 ) .
This next one is a really neat one .
It ’s a cover recreation of IRON MAN # 120 with Aquaman instead of Namor .
The drawing was done by the original artist , Bob Layton , and commissioned by Vincent P. Bartilucci ( a HUGE Aquaman fan ) .
Check out Bob Layton ’s official web site .
Come back tomorrow for more Aquaman action !
So seriously , have you checked out THE AQUAMAN SHRINE yet ?
If not , why are you broken ?
Just go visit the site and fall in love with it already !

Adding to the intrigue -- and suspicion in Sen. Norm Coleman 's camp :
The time stamp on the official tape printed out by a ballot machine in the precinct in question carried a date of Nov. 2 , two days before the election .
Election officials in Mountain Iron , Minn. , and St. Louis County said Friday they are confident the final vote totals were correct .
They chalked up the time - stamp discrepancy to a voting machine whose clock may have been improperly set or been running low on batteries .
In the midst of the unresolved election -- the tightest U.S. Senate race in Minnesota history , with a recount in the offing -- the Mountain Iron confusion is the latest wrinkle .
The difference between Coleman and Franken , which stood at 725 votes in Coleman 's favor Wednesday morning , has changed several times since then as county officials have checked results , and was 221 by Friday evening .
An election night worksheet from St. Louis County showed Franken with 406 votes from Precinct 1 in Mountain Iron .
The revised totals Thursday night showed him with 506 .
Similarly , the vote total for Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama increased from 469 to 569 when the final tallies were completed .
Both Democrats won the precinct by a ratio of more than 2 - to - 1 . " Obviously , this is highly suspicious .
They found 100 votes , and it 's statistically impossible that all 100 votes went to the two Democrats , even in St. Louis County , " said Cullen Sheehan , Coleman 's campaign manager .
The Coleman campaign , questioning " improbable and statistically dubious chunks of votes [ that ] appear and disappear , " sent letters Friday afternoon asking for records on ballot security and on any revisions of election night vote totals to the Minnesota Secretary of State 's office and to each of the state 's county auditors .
Ritchie , campaigns meet Also on Friday , Secretary of State Mark Ritchie met with representatives of both campaigns to discuss the recount .
Jess McIntosh , press secretary for the Franken campaign , said the private meeting " was constructive and courteous . "
Afterward , Ritchie held a press briefing at which he said that details of the recount will be made available on Wednesday , that the State Canvassing Board will approve a recount plan on Nov. 18 and that the recount must be complete by Dec. 5 .
The board , which certifies election results , will meet Dec. 16 and is expected to finish its work by Dec. 19 .
At the briefing , Ritchie responded to the Coleman campaign 's complaints , saying the use of words like " dubious " and " extraordinary " appeared to be a deliberate political strategy " to create a cloud " over the results of the election .
" ' Dubious ' would imply that county election officials are breaking the law and are dishonest people , " Ritchie said .
" That 's not a statement that I believe this person could support with any facts , and it's the opposite of my experience . "
In response to Ritchie 's remarks , Sheehan said it 's the campaign 's right to ask questions about the vote count process and have them answered .
" I do n't think it 's raising a cloud over the process , " he said .
Tale of the tape Officials say the Mountain Iron voting discrepancies may have occurred on election night , when city election officials called in the results to the St. Louis County seat in Duluth .
Because St. Louis County covers more than 7,000 square miles and some precincts are three hours away from the county seat , the county allows local election officials to call in unofficial results ahead of official tallies .
" They called in and gave the number , " said Paul Tynjala , the county 's elections director .
" Either we heard it wrong or the person on the other line read it wrong .
When we get the official numbers , which are the tapes , we check them and double - check them .
That 's how we caught the mistake .
We caught it right away . "
The tapes sent to Duluth , copies of which were examined by the Star Tribune , reflect the increased vote totals for Franken and Obama , but they also bear a time stamp of 7:55 a.m. Sunday , Nov. 2 , two days before the election .
Copies of election night tapes from the city 's second precinct also show a discrepancy in the time stamp , indicating the votes were tallied at 12:14 p.m. on Oct. 31 , four days before the election .
Jill Anderson , Mountain Iron 's deputy registrar , said election officials tested the machines before the election , successfully running sample ballots through for accuracy .
But she acknowledged that no one checked the clock during the test .
Election officials did see that the time stamp was off during Election Day but could not adjust the machine during public voting .
" I have n't ever paid that much attention ; normally , it 's close to the time and date stamp , but it 's never 100 percent accurate , " Anderson said Friday .
" I asked Paul [ Tynjala ] about that , ' Should I be concerned about this ? '
He said , " It 's probably the only time you 'll ever look at it . '
To us , the accuracy is in the calculation of the ballots . "
Anderson provided the newspaper with copies of the tapes from what is known as the " public accuracy test , " which also bear time stamps different from the Oct. 31 date on which Anderson said the tests were conducted .
The voting machines , which are optical scanners , were bought by St. Louis County several years ago with federal funding through the Help America Vote Act , federal legislation that arose after questions were raised about balloting in the 2000 and 2004 presidential races .
They are made by Election Systems and Software , an Omaha - based company .
A spokesman for the company said Friday they were unaware of any similar problems with time stamps on the machines but said any inaccuracy in the time stamp mechanism would not affect the accuracy of the voting tabulations .
speaking to VideoGamer.com this afternoon in London prior to the midnight launch of World of Warcraft expansion Wrath of the Lich King , Paul Sams , chief operating officer , Blizzard Entertainment , gave his word that the decision was about providing a better experience , and not about making more money .
He said : " The fact of the matter is , it 's absolutely , positively untrue about us trying to stretch it out and milk it .
People think that it was a monetary driven decision .
I can absolutely , positively tell you , with 100 per cent certainty , that that was not part of the conversation .
I guarantee it .
I give my word .
There was never , ever a conversation where we said , ' let 's do this because we 're going to make more money ' .
I guarantee it .
As a matter of fact the sole reason we did it was because we thought it was going to be a better experience .
Anybody that says otherwise is not correct .
It is absolutely not what we did it for . "
At the time of the announcement StarCraft II lead producer Chris Sigaty revealed that Blizzard decided to launch the game in three parts because it got bigger than they expected and to include all three campaigns from the get go would have delayed the game for years .
In an interview with Videogamer.com today , Blizzard 's COO Paul Sams goes on the defensive with regards to the recent decision to releaseas three separate PC products .
He insists that Blizzard is " not milking " the franchise and that players will ultimately be the ones to benefit from superior end products .
GameSpy reported the news about the trilogy back at BlizzCon in October , where it was revealed that the first part of the series would focus on the Terran campaign .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Sen .
Joe Lieberman 's speech before the Republican National Convention on Tuesday night could cost him the chairmanship of a key Senate committee , a top Senate Democratic aide told CNN .
Sen . Joe Lieberman 's speech to the Republican National Convention on Tuesday angered some Democrats .
During the speech , the Connecticut senator praised GOP presidential candidate Sen. John McCain and criticized Democratic nominee Sen. Barack Obama .
" The Democratic Caucus will reassess the situation with Sen. Lieberman after the election , " Jim Manley , a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , said Wednesday .
Lieberman , the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2000 , now calls himself an " independent Democrat , " but he remains a member of the Senate Democratic Caucus , which allows him to head the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee .
Democrats have grumbled for months about Lieberman 's outspoken support of McCain , and both Reid and Obama have warned Lieberman to curb his public criticism of Obama .
iReport.com : What did you think about Lieberman 's speech ?
" What we saw last night was a culmination of provocative efforts in recent months , " said a Democratic leadership aide .
Watch Lieberman endorse the McCain - Palin ticket »
Democrats , who with Lieberman 's support control the chamber by a narrow 51 - 49 margin , are unlikely to go a step further and boot Lieberman from their caucus , although the Democratic leadership aide did n't rule out that punitive step if Democrats pick up several seats in November .
During his address to Republicans , Lieberman said , " Sen. Barack Obama is a gifted and eloquent young man who I think can do great things for our country in the years ahead , but , my friends , eloquence is no substitute for a record , not in these tough times for America . "
That comment , and Lieberman 's suggestion that Obama had not reached across the aisle to work with Republicans in the Senate , drew the ire of Democrats , who accused their 2000 vice presidential nominee of lying about their nominee .
" Joe Lieberman ought to be ashamed of himself for some of the things he said tonight , not as a Democrat but as an American , " Obama adviser Robert Gibbs said .
Watch Gibbs blast Lieberman »
" I think [ Lieberman ] owes it to the American people to look into the camera and tell them the truth , " he added .
After Lieberman completed his speech , Reid let it be known Tuesday night that he thought Lieberman had gone over the line .
" As the American people have made very clear , the last thing this country needs is another four years of the same old failed Bush - McCain policies of the past , " Manley said .
Reacting to Lieberman 's comments , New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson , a former Democratic presidential candidate , called the independent senator 's comments " sad . "
Watch Richardson say he was " surprised " by Lieberman »
" I 've known Joe Lieberman for a long time , " Richardson said .
" I 'm just frankly so surprised at the almost violent transformation he 's taken .
" You know , it 's a little bit sad , because Joe Lieberman has been a distinguished public servant . "

Today FIRE named seniors Laura Fitzpatrick of Groton Dunstable Regional High School ( Groton , Mass . ) and Matthew Hancock of Serena High School ( Serena , Ill . ) the winners of FIRE ’s first “ Freedom in Academia ” essay contest .
Laura will receive a $ 5,000 scholarship for first place and Matthew will receive a $ 2,500 scholarship for second place .
Steven Zavala of Three Rivers High School ( Three Rivers , Mich . ) was awarded an honorable mention and will receive a $ 500 scholarship .
FIRE announced its “ Freedom in Academia ” essay contest in September and sent notifications about the contest to nearly 10,000 high schools across the country .
Students were instructed to watch two short videos about FIRE ’s work : FIRE on Campus : An Introduction to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education and FIRE in Action : Valdosta State University .
They were then to write an essay discussing the videos and explaining how these universities betrayed the purpose of a university and violated constitutional guarantees of free expression .
FIRE ’s staff received and read approximately 1,500 essay submissions and determined that Laura and Matthew had the best entries .
The quality and depth of the final essays made choosing the best a difficult decision , so FIRE decided to award an honorable mention to Steven Zavala for his outstanding essay .
In her winning essay “ Kindle the Flame — The Fight to Protect Freedom of Expression , ” Fitzpatrick wrote ,
The university system cannot and should not act as the play date chaperone who hovers over its students to protect them from hurt feelings ; hurt feelings to some degree are part of discourse and the process of becoming an adult . ” …
It is a testament to the power of freedom of speech and thought that these universities feel that it is necessary to restrict [ free speech ] in this manner , although in doing so they are essentially defeating the greatest benefit of the university system , that is , the unlimited pool of ideas and opinions upon which any student may draw .
In his essay “ Freedom of Speech : ‘ Knowledge in the Making ’ , ” Hancock wrote ,
A college campus , of all places , should be the first to protect and promote the freedom of expression essential to a democracy , but not all do ; some limit expression and expel students for engaging in political and social protests .
These institutions replace freedom of discourse with censorship .
…
Today ’s students will be tomorrow ’s leaders , and if colleges teach them to blindly obey and follow what is “ accepted , ” that will be tomorrow ’s leadership .
America was n’t founded on blindly following the majority ; it was founded on expressing individual beliefs and speaking out against injustice .
Colleges need to foster these rights and uphold democracy .
In his essay earning honorable mention , “ Learning to Think Through Free Speech , ” Zavala wrote ,
… [ P ] rotecting students from being confronted with ideas and beliefs that they find offensive is preventing them from receiving the deeper character building education that is a university ’s unparalleled offering .
…
An environment under an authority like this makes the pursuit of knowledge an absurd task , since it is impossible to know just how much information has been collected by isolated individuals on campus that has not been communicated to others because of the fear of censorship due to perceived offensiveness .
Congratulations to our winners .
We at FIRE are extremely pleased that such bright , civic - minded students are headed for college , and we look forward to working with them throughout their collegiate career on behalf of freedom of speech .
FIRE ’s “ Freedom in Academia ” essay contest , which we hope to hold annually , is open to college - bound high school seniors .
BEIJING , China ( CNN ) --
The first foreign office of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration opened Wednesday in Beijing after an influx of contaminated Chinese food and drug imports to the United States .
Chinese milk products were removed from shelves during the melamine scare .
The FDA said it also planned to open offices in the Chinese cities of Guangzhou and Shanghai in the next few days .
Subsequent locations would include India , the Middle East , Latin America and Europe .
FDA employees would inspect products and liaise with Chinese officials and groups , the agency said .
The United States intends to help the Chinese government improve its regulatory systems for exports , according to a recent statement from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , the FDA 's umbrella agency .
" Establishing a permanent FDA presence in China will greatly enhance the speed and effectiveness of our regulatory cooperation and our efforts to protect consumers in both countries , " the HHS statement said .
Last week , the FDA began blocking the import of milk products from China in an effort to ensure that products potentially contaminated with melamine did not enter the U.S. market .
Melamine is used in the manufacture of plastics and fertilizer .
Watch the FDA office being opened »
Other imported products such as cereals , snack foods , cheese , ice cream , carbonated drinks , candy , puddings and pet foods have also been found to contain the toxin , according to the agency 's Web site .
The FDA said it learned in September that more than 53,000 infants in China became sick after consuming infant formula containing melamine .
Nearly 13,000 were hospitalized and at least four died of illnesses involving the formation of kidney stones and related complications .
This week , HHS Secretary Mike Leavitt and FDA Commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach joined China 's minister of health , Chen Zhu , in a workshop on food safety .
According to HHS , they focused on policy and government reforms .
" The government should not just respond to the incident but find the root of it , " Chen said in a news conference Wednesday in Beijing .
Earlier this year , the FDA discovered that contaminated heparin , a blood thinner manufactured in China , had been linked to dozens of deaths .
The heparin was laced with a contaminant that mimics real heparin , significantly lowering the price .
Leroy Hubley of Toledo , Ohio , testified before a U.S.
House subcommittee last spring about losing his wife of 48 years and his son after they were treated with the contaminated drug .
Both had undergone hemodialysis at a Toledo clinic and were given heparin , which is widely used during open - heart surgery and dialysis , Hubley told The Toledo Blade .
Baxter International Inc. later recalled the drug .
" Now I am left to deal not only with the pain of losing my wife and son , but anger that an unsafe drug was permitted to be sold in this country , " Hubley was quoted as saying .
He also spoke this week to CNN .
He was among several Toledo residents who filed wrongful - death lawsuits against the drug company .
Last year , the United States imported about $ 856 million worth of drugs from China , and $ 4.4 billion worth of food .
" Because the world has changed a great deal , what we eat , medicines we take and products we use in the United States come from other countries , " Leavitt said at Wednesday 's news conference in Beijing .
" This year we will import nearly $ 2 trillion of goods .
To give you a sense of proportion , that is roughly four times the entire economy of Brazil , " he added .
Leavitt said U.S. President George W. Bush had appointed 12 members of his Cabinet and two agency heads to an interagency task force on food safety .

Our flickering LED circuit combined two known circuit , and certainly was n’t graceful because of it . [ sprite_tm ] saw quite a few areas where the circuit could be reduced .
He ended up taking it down to just two LEDs , a battery , and an ATtiny13 .
The first step was getting rid of the current limiting resistors .
The datasheet shows that with a 3V supply the AVR will limit the current well below the maximum current .
The light sensor was removed next .
[ sprite_tm ] referenced an earlier post on sensing with LEDs .
He measures the voltage across one of the LEDs while it is off to see how much light is hitting it .
The current draw while on is 10 mA and 50 uA while off .

I 'm in Dallas on a layover from Hawaii where I was in a wedding that was not my own .
When in Hawaii , it 's easy to forget that you 're actually in the United States .
All it took was five minutes of CNN Airport News to remind me that America was in trouble .
Here are two of the things I heard that hurt my ears .
And this does n't include the five other things or more that I 've heard since I started typing this .
First of all , the Plum Book came out today .
It lists the 8,000 or so government jobs that will be available when the administration changes .
If you 're interested , they 're posted on change.gov .
And if you are interested , you should consider that there are a lot of people without jobs and houses because the money that could have gone towards creating that position or paying that mortgage are going to pay your salary and health benefits .
Do n't take it personally , I know you will be performing an important task if you are hired , like the TSA agent who checked my boarding pass–the first and second times .
You know the same boarding pass every person accused of hijacking and crashing those flights on September 11th had .
Or you could be peforming an important task like the three people from the USDA who watched my bag go through an X - Ray to make sure I was n't carrying anything deadly back to the mainland like fresh Hawaiian fruit .
Only Dole is allowed to do that .
I digress .
The second news article was about WebMD being able to spot a flu outbreak 10 days before the CDC .
Hmm , a company can actually do something more efficiently than a government organization ?
Hard to believe .
But at least the diseases they spot wo n't be caused by fruits from Hawaii .
Tomatoes will probably take the blame , whether or not they did it .
Can someone , please , provide a good justification for why my money should be confiscated to support people who are n't competent enough to survive in the private sector and are employed for my “ safety ” that I never asked for ?
Neither did the majority of people in 75 % of the states , by the way , which is what it would have taken to pass an Amendment giving the government the official power to create these agencies to begin with .
Maybe if I write some variation of that 5000 or so times in the next 4 - 8 years , it will catch on .
Like the flu .
That the government wo n't spot until it 's 10 days to late to do anything about it .
Your Fellow American ,

Do whatever you 'd like with this article .
The vast majority of cases do settle  from 80 to 92 percent by some estimates , Mr. Kiser said  and there is no way to know whether either side in those cases could have done better at trial .
But the findings , based on a study of 2,054 cases that went to trial from 2002 to 2005 , raise provocative questions about how lawyers and clients make decisions , the quality of legal advice and lawyers ’ motives .
Critics of the profession have long argued that lawyers have an incentive to try to collect fees that are contingent on winning in court or simply to bill for all the hours required to prepare and go to trial .
“ What I would want them to look at was whether or not the lawyers had a strong financial incentive to go to trial , ” said Cristina C. Arguedas , a criminal defense lawyer in Berkeley , Calif. , when told of the study .
“ I ’m not suggesting the answer , because I do n’t know , but that would be my question . ”
The study , which is to be published in the September issue of the Journal of Empirical Legal Studies , does not directly answer Ms. Arguedas , but it does find that the mistakes were made more often in cases in which lawyers are typically paid a share of whatever is won at trial .
On average , getting it wrong cost plaintiffs at about $ 43,000 ; the total could be more because information on legal costs was not available in every case .
For defendants , who were less often wrong about going to trial , the cost was much greater : $ 1.1 million .
AS a senior mortgage underwriter , Keysha Cooper was proud of her ability to spot fraud and other problems in a loan application .
A decade of vetting mortgage documents had taught her plenty , she says .
But as a senior mortgage underwriter at Washington Mutual during the late , great mortgage boom , Ms. Cooper says she found herself in a vise .
Brokers squeezed her from one side , her superiors from the other , she says , and both pressured her to approve loans , no matter what .
“ At WaMu it was n’t about the quality of the loans ; it was about the numbers , ” Ms. Cooper says .
“ They did n’t care if we were giving loans to people that did n’t qualify .
Instead , it was how many loans did you guys close and fund ? ”
Ms. Cooper , 35 , was laid off a year ago and is still unemployed .
She came forward to discuss her experiences at the bank in order to help shareholders recover money from WaMu executives .
The “ Big Lie ” is a propaganda technique defined ( by Adolf Hitler no less ) as a lie so colossal that no one can believe that someone “ could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously ” .
The principal of the big lie ( defined by Joseph Goebbels ) is that if one needs to “ lie , one should lie big , and stick to it . ”
Furthermore , in the face of conflicting information you must keep repeating the lie , “ even at the risk of looking ridiculous . ”
A recent ( and very clear ) example of a big lie occurred after the Alaska State Legislature ’s Troopergate report concluded that Governor Sarah Palin had violated state ethics laws and abused her power .
Palin ’s response was to claim straight - faced :
Well , I ’m very very pleased to be cleared of any legal wrongdoing …
Any hint of any kind of unethical activity there .
Very pleased to be cleared of any of that .
As The Anchorage Daily News reported :
Palin ’s response is the kind of political “ big lie ” that George Orwell warned against .
War is peace .
Black is white .
Up is down .
Palin repeated this lie several times on the campaign trail , even after it was widely reported as false .
Politicians ( in general , not just Republicans ) have used the Big Lie technique for so long that it is difficult for them to stop , even though the advent of the Web and YouTube make it easy to expose these lies .
They even start to believe their own lies .
Eventually , even politicians will stop lying about simple facts ( Troopergate , Clinton ’s Bosnia Trip , etc. ) , but the Big Lie will still be used in situations where the lie cannot be easily dismissed .
For example , McCain claimed repeatedly during his campaign that he would balance the federal budget by the end of his first term , repeating it even after the economic meltdown .
Although this is basically impossible , it can not be dismissed as a lie since it is about the future .
Which brings us to the whole point of this post .
Between the economic meltdown , war , and the disastrous election , the “ Republican brand is so bad right now that if it were a dog food , they ’d take it off the shelf . ”
The ( remaining ) Republicans are now busily trying to figure out what to do about it — some want to move more toward the center while others want to double down and become even more conservative ( divided roughly by whether one thinks that Sarah Palin helped the Republican party or hurt it ) .
But these discussions are meaningless unless the Republicans understand the fundamental reasons why their “ brand ” is so far in the toilet that even Joe the Plumber could n’t reach it .
Fundamentally , there are three main components of the Republican brand , and all three of them are lies .
Big lies .
Lie # 1 ( and most easily disproved ) is that Republicans are the party of fiscal conservatives and smaller government .
Around 20 years ago something killed off the “ GOP deficit hawks ” to the point where , starting with Ronald Reagan , all Republican presidents have run up record national deficits .
Dubya ’s spending has gone through the roof , and not just because of his two wars and the creation of the huge new Homeland Security Department .
He also added expensive Medicare prescription drug benefits , a mission to Mars , and other new spending .
The only thing Republicans still do is cut taxes , which is just pandering .
Lie # 2 is that Republicans are the party of social conservatives and religious fundamentalists .
But despite talking big about banning abortion and gay marriage , the Republicans have done little to actually promote the causes that social conservatives hold dear .
The problem here is that the Republicans have become addicted to using issues like abortion to mobilize their base .
If the Republicans actually succeeded in making abortion totally illegal there would be a huge backlash , which would then mobilize the Democratic liberal base against them .
Also note that the Bush administration used their power over judicial appointments and federal prosecutors to pursue political ends , not the ends desired by social conservatives .
In short , the Republican party is using social conservatives .
Lie # 3 is that Republicans are the party of big business and free markets .
But after eight years of deregulating business after business , just to have each of them collapse in turn ( ending with the worst economic meltdown since the great depression ) it is clear that Republican policies are not good for business , not even big business .
If the Republicans actually believed in free markets , they would n’t have prohibited the government from negotiating Medicare drug prices .
And they certainly would n’t have responded to the financial meltdown by nationalizing the biggest banks and insurance companies .
Regulation is not the opposite of free markets .
The purpose of good regulation is to level the playing field , and thus create a free market with open competition ( rather than a closed market where only big established players with government connections can compete ) .
By favoring their cronies ( such as big oil ) the Republicans helped kill competition from new energy sources and new modes of transportation , but we now see that this has done more harm than good to Detroit automakers and big oil companies , not to mention hurting other businesses as energy prices soared .
Like a company whose reputation for good products has been tarnished by a series of unreliable ones , the Republicans will have to restore some believability to their brand by actually delivering on their promises .
The important question is not whether the Republicans should move toward the center or more toward the right .
The real question is when will they start walking their talk and building up some trust in their brand .
Or they can just keep lying , even at the risk of looking ridiculous .
UPDATE : David Brooks has an interesting column in the NY Times that argues that the Republican Party cannot help but move to the right ( and lose more elections ) , at least in the near future .
UPDATE 2 : Frank Rich has a very enjoyable column in the NY Times about how the conservative crackup may be ugly , but as entertainment , it ’s two thumbs up !

The record came from a stalagmite found in Wanxiang Cave , China
The demise of some of China 's ruling dynasties may have been linked to changes in the strength of monsoon rains , a new study suggests .
The findings come from 1,800 - year record of the Asian monsoon preserved in a stalagmite from a Chinese cave .
Weak - and therefore dry - monsoon periods coincided with the demise of the Tang , Yuan and Ming imperial dynasties , the scientists said .
A US - Chinese team report their work in the journal Science .
Stalagmites are largely made up of calcium carbonate , which precipitates from groundwater dripping from the ceiling of a cave .
Chemical analysis of a 118 mm - long stalagmite from Wangxiang Cave , in Gansu province , north - west China , told the history of strong and weak cycles in the monsoon - the rains that water crops to feed millions of people in Asia .
It also shows that , over the last 50 years , greenhouse gases and aerosols have taken over from natural variability to become the dominant influence on the monsoon .
Death of dynasties Small variations in the forms , or isotopes , of the stalagmite 's oxygen composition reflected variations in rainfall near the cave .
Proportions of the radioactive elements uranium and thorium in the deposit allowed the researchers to date the stalagmite layers to within an average of two - and - a - half years .
The stalagmite grew continuously from 190 AD to 2003
By comparing the rain record with Chinese historical records , Pingzhong Zhang of Lanzhou University in China , and colleagues , found three out of five " multi- century " dynasties - the Tang , the Yuan and the Ming - ended after several decades of weaker summer monsoons with drier conditions .
" Summer monsoon winds originate in the Indian Ocean and sweep into China , " said Hai Cheng , co-author from the University of Minnesota , US .
" When the summer monsoon is stronger , it pushes farther north - west into China . "
These moisture - laden winds bring rain necessary for cultivating rice .
But when the monsoon is weak , the rains stall farther south and east , depriving northern and western parts of China of summer rains .
This could have led to poor rice harvests and civil unrest , the researchers speculate .
" Whereas other factors would certainly have affected these chapters of Chinese cultural history , our correlations suggest that climate played a key role , " the researchers write in Science .
But a weak monsoon could also be linked to changes further afield .
The researchers say a dry period between 850AD and 940 AD coincides not only with the decline of the Chinese Tang dynasty but also with the fall of the Mayan civilization in America .
Human influence Subsequent strengthening of the monsoon may have contributed to the rapid increase in rice cultivation , a dramatic increase in population and general stability at the beginning of China 's Northern Song Dynasty .
The monsoon record also matched up nicely with the advance and retreat of Swiss glaciers .
Scientists say the natural archive shows that climate change can have devastating effects on local populations - even when this change is mild when averaged across the globe .
In the cave record , the monsoon followed trends in solar activity over many centuries , suggesting the Sun played an important role in the variability of this weather system .
To a lesser extent , it also followed northern hemisphere temperatures on a millennial and centennial scale .
As temperatures went up , the monsoon became stronger and , as they dropped , it weakened .
However , over the last 50 years , this relationship has switched .
The researchers attribute this to the influence of greenhouse gas emissions and sulphate aerosols released by human activities .

Jesse Jackson , Jr. is seen as a potential successor to Barack Obama in the Senate .
Should Obama 's replacement be black ?
Although Barack Obama ’s historic election will place an African - American in the White House , it will reduce the number of African - Americans in the Senate to zero .
That ’s an even lonelier number than one , and it is not a number that this nation should be proud of .
So the question is : Does Obama ’s replacement in the Senate have to be black ?
Advertisement
Some would argue yes .
And Jesse Jackson Jr. , a member of the House since 1995 , began campaigning for the slot even before Obama won the presidency .
Jackson , son of the Rev. Jesse Jackson , was one of Obama ’s national co-chairmen and says he would be “ honored and humbled ” to replace Obama .
So he ’s an easy choice , a shoo - in for the job , right ?
Well , no .
The politics of Illinois is not quite that simple .
And the top contenders for the job have a tangled web of relationships with the people who will have a voice in Obama ’s replacement , including Obama himself ; Dick Durbin , the other Democratic senator from Illinois ; Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich , a Democrat , who officially will make the choice , and Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley , now in his sixth term , who has , to put it mildly , a certain amount of influence in the state .
Rep . Jackson does not have a good relationship with Mayor Daley .
They disagree on a huge local issue — whether to build a new airport south of Chicago near Jackson ’s district or expand O’Hare — and Jackson also toyed with the idea of running against Daley for mayor in 2007 .
At that time , Jackson brought up the touchy subject of fathers , saying that perhaps Mayor Daley was not proud of everything his father , the late Richard J. Daley , had done .
“ His father was responsible for segregated policies of the city , ” Rep. Jackson said .
“ I ’m sure the mayor is not excited about the shoot - to - kill order , the protests or how Dr. King was treated .
I ’m sure he is not proud of that . ”
Political attacks are one thing , but attacks on family are another , and in Chicago , neither is forgiven .
( Jackson decided not to run against Daley , who was easily reelected . )
Gov.
Blagojevich is not a fan of Jackson ’s either , and , personalities and feuds aside , the argument used against Jackson is that he would “ lack appeal downstate ” when he had to run for election to the Senate seat in 2010 .
Lacking appeal downstate is code for , “ White people wo n’t vote for him . ”
A Chicago political insider whom I trust says that Jackson is on a list of possible replacements for Obama but that Jackson has only an outside chance .
One intriguing name on the shortlist is that of Emil Jones , 73 , currently president of the Illinois Senate .
He was one of Obama ’s political patrons , is close to the governor and is an African - American , yet I got snorts of derision when I ran his name past some other Illinois sources of mine .
That ’s because Jones is from the old school — he started out as a sewer inspector , which is not bad training for a life in politics — and is not a modern , ready - for - TV candidate , possessing an orator ’s tongue .
He is a Chicago pol — the ring tone on his cell phone is the theme from “ The Godfather ” — but he would be a “ place holder ” only and would not run in 2010 .
He would fill the seat with an African - American and give the other contenders plenty of time to start their campaigns .
There is another name on the short list , however , and she is not an African - American .
Tammy Duckworth , an Asian - American , lost both legs in combat in Iraq — she volunteered to fly helicopters because it was one of the few combat jobs a woman could get — and was personally recruited to run for the House in 2006 by Dick Durbin with the enthusiastic support of Rep.
Rahm Emanuel , who would go on to engineer her campaign ; David Axelrod , who would become her media consultant ; and Barack Obama .
( Duckworth , like Obama , now opposes the war in Iraq . )
Duckworth lost narrowly and is now Blagojevich ’s director of veterans affairs .
So a lot of important names all come together when you start looking at Duckworth .
But Jesse Jackson Jr. is not giving up .
Jackson has gone so far as to commission a poll , which was released Tuesday , that shows him in the lead for the job .
( If the poll did not show him in the lead , would it have been released ? )
Anyway , the poll , by Zogby International , says that when given the choice of 10 possible candidates , 21 percent of likely voters in Illinois think Blagojevich should appoint Jackson , 14 percent say Blagojevich should appoint Duckworth , and everybody else is in single digits .
( Emil Jones was not among the names polled . )
But the poll also provided some interesting ammunition — for Duckworth .
According to the poll , Jackson has a 43 percent favorable rating and a 22 percent unfavorable rating , which gives him a net favorable of 21 .
Duckworth has a favorable rating of 31 and an unfavorable rating of 9 , which gives her a net favorable of 22 , a point higher than Jackson .
Many more people know Jackson than know Duckworth .
Only 35 percent of those polled were not familiar with or not sure about him , compared with 60 percent who were not familiar with or not sure about Duckworth .
So her net favorable could shrink .
Or grow .
In any case , polls are not likely to matter much .
This is not an election , it is an appointment , and there are a lot of people vying besides the three names I have mentioned .
But on Tuesday , which was Veterans Day , Obama laid a wreath at a memorial near Soldier Field in Chicago , and Duckworth was at his side .
Because she is the state ’s director of veterans affairs , this made sense .
Obama could have selected someone else , however , or done the wreath laying alone .
But he chose to lay the wreath with Duckworth and stand for a solemn moment with his arm around her .
So does Barack Obama ’s replacement in the Senate have to be black ?
Or does his election mean we are beyond such questions ?
RE " GAY - MARRIAGE debate roils , unites Mormons " ( Page A1 , Nov. 24 ) :
It seems that Mormon supporters of California 's Proposition 8 want it both ways .
On the one hand , the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints mounted a bare - knuckles political fight to ban same - sex marriage .
The network of LDS wards and stakes coalesced into a tax - subsidized political machine , energetically fund - raising and mobilizing campaign volunteers to influence public policy .
On the other hand , when faced with the criticism that is standard fare in politics , Mormon church spokespeople waved the bloody shirt of religious persecution , as if anyone were seeking to impinge upon the free exercise of religion .
The Mormons have every right to participate in the political process .
But the LDS church overreaches when it politicks with the benefit of federal and state tax exemptions , then spurns accountability for an apostolically sanctioned crusade to enshrine sectarian beliefs in secular law .
Something has to give - either the tax - privileged status of the LDS church , or extraordinary political campaign exertions that played a disproportionate role in stripping gay and lesbian Californians of civil rights .

IN " GAY - MARRIGE debate roils , unites Mormons , " Jennifer Thomas of Belmont says , " You 're either a nitwit bigot , or you 're for gay marriage - no one has left people of faith an alternative place to stand . "
Here 's a clue for " people of faith " who bemoan their unfriendly treatment by gay activists :
Once you stop attacking their human rights , people get a lot friendlier .

You might think the Better Business Bureau would have better business to attend to than trying to protect gullible Internet video watchers from the most preposterous fakeries perpetrated by viral marketers .
You'd be wrong .
You might also believe that four ringing cell phones can emit enough heat and / or radiation to pop popcorn , in which case you 'll be heartened to learn that the BBB has your sorry back .
The National Advertising Division ( NAD ) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus said in a press release ( . pdf ) yesterday :
Advertising claims made in the context of viral videos produced to build interest in a product are subject to the same standards of truth and accuracy as advertisements published in traditional media .
NAD examined a video clip disseminated by Cardo Systems , the manufacturer of wireless Bluetooth head - sets , as part of a viral marketing campaign .
The video , which appeared on the YouTube Web site , depicts individuals using their cell phones to pop popcorn kernels in close proximity .
NAD had requested that the advertiser address certain potential concerns including the possibility that the video clip communicated implied claims about the level of heat and / or radiation emitted by cell phones and the need to use headsets .
The videos in question -- there were different versions -- caused quite a snap , crackle and pop when they made the rounds this summer , despite being quickly revealed as fakes by the likes of Gawker and this handy - dandy how - to demonstration .
End of story , right ?
Well , apparently NAD concluded that this commercial ruse warranted an " inquiry , " and even tough that inquiry was cut short by the fact that the advertiser stopped using the videos , there was an " opportunity offered by its review to provide guidance of principles that apply to advertising in non-traditional media . "
Now it 's worth noting that NAD 's judgment and the BBB 's truth - in - advertising guidelines are just that , guidelines , initiated as part of a campaign designed to " foster truth and accuracy in national advertising through voluntary self - regulation . "
( Insert laugh track here . )
And while few would argue that there should n't be standards of some kind , even in the make - believe world of advertising , we 're talking about popping popcorn with cell phones here .
Does anyone raise a stink when advertising videos show equally implausible situations such as flying automobiles or gorgeous women fawning over pot -bellied bar flies ?
The press release concludes this way : " In non-traditional media , to the extent that advertising claims are communicated , advertisers are required to substantiate those claims with competent and reliable scientific evidence . "
On the Internet ?
Good luck with that one .
Forbes Disses Violet Affleck on ' Hollywood 's Hottest Tots ' List ( PHOTOS )
Forbes.com released their 2008 Hollywood 's Hottest Tots list andended up at the top of the heap of celebrity toddlers .
The criteria for landing a spot include the number of press clipping , web presence and age .
All 50 kids under consideration were 5 years old or younger .
We 've got photos of the top ten media darlings of 2008 .
In rank order behind Suri are Shiloh Jolie - Pitt , Zahara Jolie - Pitt , Pax Jolie - Pitt , Sam Alexis Woods , Cruz Beckham , Matilda Rose Ledger , David Banda , Sean Preston Federline and Sam Sheen .
It is likely that Brad and Angelina 's oldest son Maddox would have landed on the list but for the fact that he is now seven years old - leaving him odd kid out among his sibs .

Browsing around for bike - related goodies today , we came across this brilliant example of proletariat problem - solving in the name of an improved urban cycling experience .
They call it the Traffic Loop Sensor Activator , or sometimes U.S. Patent # 7,432,827 -- we call it a nice alternative to sweating for minutes at a time in the midst of high - speed traffic , waiting for a green light that never comes .
The gadget , depicted above , directly triggers the inductive sensors embedded in the roadway at many intersections , by creating a strong but short - lived magnetic field that simulates the presence of a much larger conductor -- like the steel body of a car .
Note that it 's not an always - on kind of deal ; the cyclist must press a button to activate it when centered over the telltale two - rectangle groove of the induction sensor coil , but it 's a heck of a lot better than hoping for a car to come along and rescue you , or risk running a red light with an excuse no dedicated motorist is going to believe .
Obviously clunky and big , we 'd love to see a sleeker version integrated into a few of the growing multitude of " urban commuter " bikes being trotted out lately , if only out of pure self - interest .
We 've gotta wonder , though , what the prototype testing looked like for this one .
Late night intersection inspections maybe ?

Imagine … you are the master of how to get high without drugs … sitting in your room , enjoying the kind of brilliant , cosmic high that other people pay good money for – but it costs you nothing , you can turn it off at any time , and not only is it harmless – it actually strengthens and improves your health !
Sound like bullshit ?
Well it ’s not ; it ’s truth , and you can make it a part of your reality today !
Here ’s How To Get High Without Drugs
Confession : I Am a Complete Tripper
I get high without drugs on a regular basis – like , I am talking “ Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas ” here – except with two major differences :
No paranoia or other negative side - effects I do n’t actually take any kind of drug or substance to induce my highs
So how can you get right - out - there high without taking drugs ?
Introducing … Psychedelic Meditation
Like some weird kind of hippy scientist , I have spent the last ten years refining a system of meditation designed – amongst other benefits – to induce a wonderful , clear , clean and blissful Cosmic High .
Here ’s how it happened …
I used to be big into drugs and alcohol – I was a musician with all the usual crazy ideas about what constituted a good idea and a fun time .
My values have changed a bit now , but more so my physical ability to punish myself like that anymore .
( At 35 – and after really going for party - gold for many years – the old system just does n’t dig that crazy shit anymore . )
I used to pride myself on my ability to party on without much in the way of negative side - effects , I would go straight from a late night club to work in the morning and think nothing of it .
But by the time my mid-late twenties rolled around I found myself getting more and more depressed .
I turned to meditation to alleviate these feelings and pretty soon I was back on track and feeling better , but something else kept happening …
Something unexpected …
Although it was not why I had taken up meditation , sometimes I would notice a very pleasant side effect that came over me when I was meditating …
Meditating Was Getting Me As High As A kite – And I Loved it !
I had learned how to get high without drugs and , honestly , it was amazing – .
I remember once a friend of mine knocked on my apartment door when I was in the middle of a particularly wonderful meditation induced high and when I answered the door he said something like “ Man !
You are totally glowing with some kind of supernatural light ! ” ( I kid you not ! )
I hugged him and then started enthusiastically describing how I was feeling : how I felt like my body was swimming in warm , sticky honey and how I was just so incredibly happy and how everything looked so trippy and how everything in the world just made so much sense … and he said “ Dude !
You ’re on acid , right ? ”
But I was n’t – not at all – and anyway it felt better than acid ( I would know ) .
I was hooked – well , not literally because it ’s not a destructive addictive substance – but I definitely wanted to feel this incredible Bliss as often as possible .
BUT …
It did n’t happen every time .
Sometimes I would sit and it just would n’t happen .
I had figured out how to get high without drugs … sometimes …
But I kept at it and after ten years practice I can honestly say that I have got it down to a pretty fine art .
What I am saying is – I totally know how to get high without drugs – like a boss .

Jumbo squid can weigh up to 50kg and grow to two metres in length Jumbo squid , common to the eastern tropical Pacific , may become rarer if current climate change continues .
Writing in the journal PNAS , researchers say the squids ' lifestyle could be strongly influenced by changes in ocean acidity .
Climate models suggest oceans are becoming more acidic as a result of absorbing the carbon dioxide released by human activities .
Rises in acidity have already been shown to affect shellfish and corals .
Metabolic change
An international team of researchers says the jumbo squid ( Dosidicus gigans ) has an unusual feature that makes it particularly susceptible to changes in ocean acidity ; the squid has the ability to dramatically vary the pace at which its body systems function .
" When the squid feed near the surface they have a very quick metabolism , " says lead author Rui Rosa , from the Department of Oceanography at Lisbon University , Portugal .
" But as they dive deeper they are able to slow their metabolism by as much as 80 % , " he adds .
During the night the squid feed rapidly near the ocean surface .
Yet during the day , they seek out deeper waters that contain less oxygen , causing their metabolism to slow down .
According to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , CO2 released by human activities is continually dissolving in the world 's oceans .
As a result , oceans are becoming more acidic .
The researchers say increased acidification of the ocean will reduce the availability of oxygen near the surface and so depress the squids ' metabolism in a similar manner to what happens when the creatures dive to greater depths .
The researchers caught squid at night and put them in chambers that mimicked the effects of climate change .
They simulated the conditions they think the squid may have to endure in 2100 .
The jumbo squid dives to deep water during the day " Ocean acidification , at a level predicted for the end of the 21st Century , suppresses energy production by approximately 30 % , making them more lethargic , especially at high temperatures , " Dr Rosa explained .
The researchers say the squid is very vulnerable as a result of the combination of three factors : sea temperature rises ; acidification ; and the existing lack of oxygen in the deep ocean .
" In the future , the habitable window between low oxygen at depth and acidified and warmer waters at the surface will grow narrower , " warns Dr Rosa .
" The net result will be that the squid may become more susceptible to predators , less able to capture prey , or may be forced to migrate elsewhere , altering the oceanic food web . "
The squid may start to hunt different fish species , especially in shallower water where oxygen levels may be higher .
The movement of squid populations could also lead to a decrease in the availability of deep ocean squid for both commercial squid fisheries and whale populations that prey on squid .

With the South Florida Bulls playing in the St. Petersburg Bowl on Saturday , I figured it was a good time to look at one of their most famous fans .
Jenn Sterger has had a few different loyalties over the years , but for awhile she was seen at USF games , so we have gathered up those photos and decided to post them for you here .
Do n’t worry Seminole fans , we will do a gallery of Jenn sporting the FSU colors next week in preparation for the Champs Sports Bowl .
For any fans of girls from USF in general , we found over 125 photos of those while we were looking for pictures of Jenn , so we will put them in a separate post .
Go Bulls !
How about Jenn Sterger on Video filming pieces on location at USF ?
We have those too …

Remember Jeff Greene ?
He 's a real estate investor who owns several commercial buildings in Southern California , mostly apartments .
You can read my first post and see the video intervews I did with him from February in the link below .
Earlier in his career , Greene won and lost a real estate fortune , and when his portfolio rebuilt itself , he did n't want to get burned again .
He wanted a hedge .
So two years ago , he " borrowed " an idea from his friend ( at the time ) , hedge fund giant John Paulson .
Paulson told Greene he was starting a fund where investors could short the subprime market though credit default swaps .
Briefly this is how it worked : you find a bond backed by risky mortgages from places like California or Florida .
You invest in that bond and then buy insurance from someone else to protect yourself in case the bond defaults ( this is the credit default swap ) .
You actually WANT the bond to default .
Because , even as you pay your " insurance premiums , " when the bond defaults , you get reimbursed its full value , making a fabulous profit .
Greene decided against joining Paulson 's fund and instead went out on his own to buy swaps .
He spent a long time researching individual bonds he felt were likely to fail , then invested in them .
He bought " insurance " from JP Morganand Merrill Lynch , the only two firms willing to do this sort of business with an individual investor .
How did it turn out ?
Let 's just say very well .
Greene has gone from millionaire to billionaire in the last year , making Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans , with an estimated net worth of $ 1.4 billion .
By the way , Paulson was n't happy Greene took his idea and ran with it .
More on that in my next post .
When we first interviewed Jeff Greene in February , he was trying to unwind some of his swaps and get into cash .
" The problem I think in the financial markets is that there is n't enough transparency , " he said on February 21st .
" I just think that , for some reason , the government has not come into all of these institutions and made them come clean ... it's just surprise , surprise , surprise . "
Three weeks later , Bear Stearns collapsed .
Then a funny thing happened .
While the rest of the market became illiquid , in Greene 's corner of the universe trading ramped up .
" It 's the craziest thing , " he says .
" We 're in a time where there 's record illiquidity , but in these positions , starting about four or five months ago , they became completely liquid .
I was able to obtain on every one of these positions multiple offers . "
He thinks that happened as investment houses started to clean up their books post - Bear .
SIMPLY FPU
by Raymond Filiatreault
Copyright 2003
CONTENTS
INTRODUCTION
The FPU , also known as a co-processor , used to be an option when the first PCs came on the market .
Modern PCs are now all provided with a co-processor .
Although the original PC - XT has evolved considerably over the years , the FPU itself has not changed appreciably during that same period .
Apart from a few minor instructions having been added , the main improvement has been the extended range of some of the existing instructions .
The entire set of assembler instructions for the FPU is relatively small and could be memorized rapidly .
Learning which parameter (s ) can be used with each instruction should take only slightly longer .
The main difficulty is in developing sound programming techniques to avoid some of the pitfalls peculiar to the FPU .
The main purpose of this document is to show that using the FPU can be relatively easy with minimal effort .
Once the basics have been mastered , any computation however complex can be performed .
The first chapter describes the internals of the FPU and how they function .
Some of this knowledge is an absolute necessity to use the FPU properly or help later in understanding the outcome of some of the instructions .
This is followed by a chapter describing the various data types which can be used with some of the instructions , including a detailed review of the floating point data formats .
The FPU instructions are then discussed in detail in the following chapters which regroup them according to some " biased " criteria .
Although some description of each instruction is available in the Fphelp.hlp file provided with MASM32 , a more in - depth review is provided with more tangible examples of their usage .
The final chapter provides a fully commented example of a semi-complex computation .
It should be noted that this document has been prepared according to the syntax used by MASM .
Although most other assemblers / compilers should have a similar syntax for the FPU instruction mnemonics , their syntax may differ for the addressing mode of memory variables .
It is also known that some of the instructions used without explicit parameters are not supported by some of the other assemblers / compilers .
Any comment or suggestion aimed at improving this document will be given due consideration .

CARACAS , Venezuela 
The commander of Colombia ’s army resigned Tuesday after an investigation tied dozens of military personnel under his command to an intensifying scandal over the killing of civilians by the armed forces in what apparently were attempts to inflate the number of insurgents or criminal gang members killed in combat by security forces .
The resignation of the commander , Gen. Mario Montoya , 59 , an American - trained officer who won acclaim for battlefield achievements during his 39 - year career , comes amid a broad shake - up in the Colombian military even as it celebrates a string of victories in recent months against leftist guerrillas .
The government of President Álvaro Uribe fired 27 officers and soldiers last week , including three generals , over reports that impoverished young men had been lured from the slums around Bogotá and taken to a war zone in northern Colombia , where they were killed by troops , classified as subversives and later found in unmarked graves .
“ These killings permeate the entire military hierarchy and their civilian overseers , ” Senator Gustavo Petro , an outspoken opposition figure , said in a telephone interview from Bogotá , the Colombian capital .
“ General Montoya ’s resignation was necessary , but the administration must be held responsible for allowing crimes like these to occur . ”
The new software will protect machines running XP , Vista , and Windows 7
In a surprise move , Microsoft has announced it will offer a free anti-virus and security solution from the second half of next year .
It will stop selling OneCare , its all - in - one security and PC management service , from the end of June 2009 .
The new software , code - named Morro , will be a no-frills program suited to smaller and less powerful computers .
The software will be free to download and will support Windows XP , Vista and Windows 7 .
The move comes as sales of the OneCare subscription service are flagging - reportedly because the anti-virus marketplace is already flooded with big - name players such as Symantec and McAfee .
Since its launch in May 2006 , OneCare has garnered less than 2 % of the security software market share .
In a statement , Microsoft said that Morro would be designed specifically to be a small - footprint program that uses fewer system resources .
This , it said , would be ideal for users with low - bandwidth connections or computers without much processing power .
That will be of particular interest to consumers buying comparatively low - powered " netbook " computers .
Amy Barzdukas , senior director of product management in the online services division at Microsoft , said : " This new , no -cost offering will give us the ability to protect an even greater number of consumers , especially in markets where the growth of new PC purchases is outpaced only by the growth of malware .

Today ’s Wall Street Journal notes that the world ’s financial problems go well beyond a credit crisis :
The original bubble was in housing prices and mortgage - related assets , which the Federal Reserve helped to create with its negative real interest rates from 2002 into 2005 .
This was Alan Greenspan ’s tragic mistake , not that the former Fed chief will acknowledge it .
Testifying before Congress yesterday , Mr. Greenspan pinned the crisis on mortgage securitizers , risk modelers and lending institutions , thus contributing to the Washington narrative that government had little to do with it .
The Fed ’s monetary policy apparently gets a pass .
The media and Members of Congress will use Mr. Greenspan ’s testimony to impugn the very free market principles that the former Ayn Rand protégé has spent his life promoting .
It was a painful spectacle to watch .
As for the second bubble , this one began in August 2007 with the onset of the credit panic .
This is Ben Bernanke ’s creation .
The Fed chose to confront the credit crunch as if it were mainly a problem of too little liquidity , not fear of insolvency .
To that end it flooded the economy with money , while taking short - term interest rates down to 2 % from 5.25 % in seven months .
The panic only got worse , and this September ’s stampede finally led the Treasury and Fed to address the solvency problem by supplying public capital and numerous guarantees to the financial system .
But , in the process , the Federal Reserve had created a monetary / commodity price bubble that is clearly reflected in these two charts :
As the Journal points out , the consequence of this monetary bubble is that it has left us , and the rest of the world in a much weaker position to respond to the credit crisis that , even today , continues to rampage it ’s way through the financial system .
And yet , both major political parties , and both major - party candidates , continue to ignore reality , as the Journal points out :
As Congress plumbs the causes of our current mess , the main one is hiding in plain sight : Reckless monetary policy that did so much to create the credit mania and then compounded the felony with a commodity bubble and run on the dollar whose damage is now becoming apparent .
The American people intuitively understand what ’s been done to them , which is why they are so angry .
If the next President ignores the monetary roots of our troubles , he is courting the same fate as George W. Bush .
Monetary policy is n’t fun , it is n’t sexy , it does n’t make for cute soundbites or 30 second television commercials , but it ’s important and it ’s been ignored for far too long .
Unless we start paying attention to it soon , the Bush years may start looking like the good old days .
Not , says Eric Cantor .
Meanwhile , in the media news story of the hour Bill Kristol manages to write a halfway decent and almost honest column .
Yes : almost .
If Kristol wrote an actually honest column , a rip would open up in the time - space continuum .

Where to put neo -Nazi rubbish
ALOIS MANNICHL , police chief of Passau , in Bavaria , pursues neo -Nazis to great lengths .
A group recently buried a leader in a coffin draped with the swastika .
Mr Mannichl had it dug up .
On December 13th they took their revenge .
Crying “ you will not trample the graves of our comrades any more , you leftist pig , ” somebody stabbed and almost killed Mr Mannichl at the door of his house in Fürstenzell , near Passau .
This brazen attack on a senior policeman brings a “ completely new dimension ” to violence by right - wing extremists , declared Bavaria 's interior minister , Joachim Herrmann .
Germany 's far right is a variegated but worrying fringe that pursues its xenophobic aims through electoral politics and sometimes murderous violence , fuelled by self - glorifying demonstrations and “ hatecore ” music .
It is stronger in the east than in the west .
The National Democratic Party of Germany ( NPD ) has seats in two east German state legislatures ( another far right party has deputies in Brandenburg ) and does well in local elections .
It won 5 % of the vote in Saxony 's local election in June , getting 25 % in one town .
The far right got 2.5 % of the vote in Bavaria 's election in September .
The Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz , Germany 's domestic intelligence agency , reckons that some 31,000 people belong to 180 far - right organisations around the country .
But many more are thought to share some of their attitudes .
A fifth of Germans — and nearly 40 % of Bavarians — dislike foreigners , down from a quarter two years ago .
Far - right violence in Bavaria is mostly low - level thuggery by young skinheads .
They and others were responsible for 82 violent crimes in 2007 , nearly twice as many as in 2006 ; but the rate subsided in the first half of 2008 .
The police have so far been spared .
Now some wonder if the far right may produce its version of the Baader - Meinhof gang , which conducted a reign of terror against prominent Germans in the 1970s .
This seems far - fetched .
But the stabbing of Mr Mannichl has renewed calls for the banning of the NPD , which has ties to a number of even less savoury groups .
Thanks largely to Mr Mannichl , the neo - Nazi scene in Passau , a town of 50,000 at the confluence of the Danube and two other rivers , is a weedy affair .
There are no cells in Passau itself , says Karl Synek , a Green member of the town council .
Two or three meet in the neighbourhood in the few bars and cafés whose owners tolerate them , including a café in Fürstenzell .
But Passau is a “ white spot ” on the map where far - right groups are trying to gain a foothold with help from allies on the other side of the border with Austria , says Mr Synek .
With luck , a recovered Mr Mannichl will soon return to Passau 's defences .
There ’s only one way to tackle the biggest obstacles – a tiny bit at a time .
Every small contribution adds up .
Here are eight challenges that face us today , and the seemingly small changes to our lifestyles ( and so to ourselves ) that could make a real difference .
THE FOOD WE EAT
Food , water , shelter – the most basic requirements to sustain human life .
Thanks to catastrophic global agflation , one of these is in widespread turmoil .
Lack of food is causing terrible suffering .
Meanwhile in the developed world , good food is ending up in landfills .
The world is out of balance .
WHAT CAN I DO ?
Buy only the food you use .
Keep a shopping list , and aim to process all your fresh food within a week of buying it .
HOW WILL THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE ?
At least a quarter of American groceries go to waste .
In Britain it ’s an estimated one in three bags of edible food – some $ 20 billion of groceries each year .
If you buy only the food you use , you save money and someone else gets that food .
If you ’re sceptical about the food reaching the people who really need it , then look at what you ’ve saved in grocery bills at the end of the month , and donate a portion of that money directly to a charity or micro-loan provider .
A PLASTIC SCOURGE
It clogs our rivers and seas .
It suffocates wildlife and lingers in landfills .
It ’s a modern scourge - and it ’s become known as urban tumbleweed .
WHAT CAN I DO ?
There ’s two things to do with plastic supermarket bags – work around them and work against them .
The former is as simple as remembering to carry a tote bag when you go shopping .
In the latte case , do n’t ever use the plastic bags provided by your local supermarket .
Drop them a note ( perhaps in their suggestion box ) asking why they ’re still using them when they ’ve been banned for over a sixth of the world ’s population .
There ’s no need to be strident : politeness sinks the message deeper .
HOW WILL THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE ?
Katharine Mieszkowski’s article at Salon covers it nicely .
RISING GAS PRICES
Getting into the car seems a matter of instinct for much of the modern world , and particularly in the U.S. – in 2001 , 90 % of Americans were using their car to get to work .
The US auto industry relies heavily on subsidies and bailouts when things are n’t going well … and with the state of global oil reserves , things are unlikely to improve .
Domestic American ethanol production could n’t even meet a tenth of the ravenous fuel demands of cars currently on the road .
The only way forward is to kick the auto habit – and every little helps .
WHAT CAN I DO ?
Here ’s a good way to start .
Whenever it ’s practical to do so – walk .
( Or cycle ) .
Particularly for short journeys .
Factor in an extra ten minutes travel time , and use your legs .
HOW WILL THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE ?
Last year , How to Live a Low - Carbon Life author Chris Goodall calculated that driving to the shops uses less carbon that walking .
This statement is well - argued , logical , and completely useless to anyone but advocates of the automobile industry ( it ’s a damning statement on food prices , not the eco- friendliness of driving , as Goodall himself notes ) .
Driving very short distances is fuel - inefficient : starting your car is around as much energy as idling it for one minute .
Anything that reduces American consumption from a whopping 21 million barrels of oil a day is good for the economy and for the environment .
And what about your own health ?
LIGHT POLLUTION
When the sun falls below the horizon , modern society fights the dark .
In keeping our cities and roads illuminated , we squander our precious energy reserves skywards in a blaze of candlepower we simply can’t afford .
Light pollution is bad for the environment in ways we ’re only just beginning to understand .
WHAT CAN I DO ?
At night , dim the lights and rediscover the dark .
HOW WILL THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE ?
By dimming their lights for Earth Hour 2008 , Toronto residents saved an estimated 434 Megawatts ( MW ) of electricity – for comparison , standard nuclear power stations generate from 500 to 1000 MW .
THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY
Going green is about communing with Nature , leaving the modern world behind and harking back to a happier , more eco-friendly era when humans lived in perfect harmony with the landscape – right ?
Except it ’s not that simple .
Take the “ wild ” moors of Britain – many of them result from deliberate deforestation during prehistoric times .
We ’ve always made our mark on the planet with technology – yet recently it ’s reached a scale where our ecosystem can’t adapt itself fast enough .
So now it ’s up to us to make amends .
Should we throw away the best tools we have to do this ?
WHAT CAN I DO ?
Buy a programmable thermostat and save 10 % on your heating bills .
Buy CFLs for now and LEDs later , and save energy when lighting your house .
Upgrade your home , 21st Century style .
Spend quality time with a crank or two !
Buy and use your gadgets wisely , and keep a constant eye on the technological cutting edge of green .
HOW WILL THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE ?
Take renewable energy – it ’s all about using the best technology science can provide .
And look at the results of doing so .
THE RIGHT KIND OF SHOPPING
Image : ralphbijker
Contrary to what some would have you believe , a sustainable lifestyle is not about vowing to never buy anything “ non-essential ” ever again .
Shopping is green – but only if it ’s done right .
WHAT CAN I DO ?
Eco-artisans and fair - traded products deserve your custom , from the beads of Project Have Hope to the fresh produce of the Milkweed Mercantile .
By buying products that have an unambiguously eco-friendly component to them , and by closing your ears to the greenwashers ( and their twins , the greenscourers ) , you can prevent profits triumphing over ethics .
HOW WILL THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE ?
The Fair Trade movement , for all that it should be called “ Fairer Trade ” , gives producers a better deal without compromising on social and environmental standards .
It ’s a success because shoppers often choose to buy Fair Trade over cheaper , more readily available items .
It ’s a great start .
GIVING POLITICIANS WHAT THEY NEED
Image : ricardo.martins
Next month , the United States has a new president .
He ’s already been unprecedentedly vocal about his commitment to the environment – and , like all politicians , it ’s his job to listen to what people want .
He needs feedback to do his job well .
WHAT CAN I DO ?
A green lifestyle is a politicized one .
You do n’t have to march in endless rallies or pore over The Economist every week – but you should have a read around the most pressing issues facing your governments , federal and local .
Your voice deserves to be heard – if you ’re doing everything possible to live in the real world .
Sustainability is pragmatic : there ’s no room for unthinking dogma in today ’s eco-political climate , and the best way to approach green issues is with open ears , open eyes and an open mind .
HOW WILL IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE ?
Because , more than ever , Washington listens .
THE NEED FOR GROWN -UP CHILDREN
Remember when you were a child ?
Your optimism and determination knew no bounds ( I ’ve fallen over ?
Well , I ’ll get up again ) .
Everything was endlessly fascinating , and nothing was n’t worth learning about .
You had more energy than you knew what to do with .
Would n’t it be great to experience the world like that again ?
WHAT CAN I DO ?
A thriving green lifestyle is : optimism about the effects of your personal choices , determination in the face of contrary commercial pressures , fascination in scientific innovations that will clean up our environmental impact , a willingness to learn new skills and relearn old ones , and applied energy and enthusiasm in adapting to an ever - changing modern world .
Sound familiar ?
HOW WILL IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE ?
By giving our children the future they deserve .

One week to go .
With the GOP in a state of desperation , how bad will this get ?
Raw Story :
A forged flyer going to voters in a closely fought Virginia congressional district seems aimed at suppressing Democratic turnout on Election Day .
Purporting to come from Virginia ’s Board of Elections , the flyer says “ All Democratic party supporters and independent voters supporting Democratic candidates shall vote on November 5th . ”
That ’s one day after Election Day . [.. ]
The article goes on to say it is unclear who is circulating the flyer , but that the state police are investigating .
It is clearly targeting Democratic voters ..
Polls have showed Obama is pulling away in Virginia in recent weeks , and many analysts say it is becoming more likely he will prevail in the state .
Read the rest of this article ..
Is this the same Virginia GOP that sent out this letter ?

The OED is the Everest of dictionaries Ammon Shea spent a year reading the Oxford English Dictionary - 20 volumes , 21,730 pages and 59 million words - and he rates poring over a dictionary as enriching as reading a novel .
Why ?
The prospect of talking to a man who reads dictionaries for fun prompts a sudden vocabulary - insecurity complex and a fear that every word he utters might sound like a painful medical condition .
But thanks to Ammon Shea 's belief that long words only hinder conversations , there 's no need to consult any dictionaries while he clearly explains his eccentric hobby .
" I 'm not against big words per se or fancy or obscure words , obviously I love them , but I 'm opposed to using them for their own sake , " he says .
" If words are to form a communication , you use them as a tool to communicate to people and it's pointless to intentionally use a word that no - one else knows . "
SOME OF HIS FAVOURITES ...
Cachinnator - one who laughs too much or too loudly Dyspathy - the opposite of sympathy Gove - to stare stupidly Hansardize - to change one 's opinion Happify - to make happy Natiform - buttock - shaped Pejorist - one who thinks the world is getting worse Philodox - one who is in love with his own opinion Secretary - one who is privy to a secret Tripudiate - to dance , skip or leap for joy Mr Shea , a 37 - year - old former furniture remover in New York , has spent 12 months conquering what he describes as the Everest of dictionaries , the Oxford English Dictionary ( OED ) , by ploughing through 20 volumes weighing a total of 137lbs ( 62.14kg ) .
In the process , he became the Morgan Spurlock of lexicologists , devouring words for eight to 10 hours a day , which caused him severe headaches , deteriorating eyesight and injuries to his back and neck .
So why bother ?
" I 've always enjoyed reading dictionaries and they are far more interesting than people give them credit for .
And I think everything you find in a great book you would find in a great dictionary , except for the plot .
" All the normal emotions - grief , happiness and loss - exist in a dictionary but not necessarily in the order that you would think . "
If you come across a word like " remord " ( to recall with a touch of regret ) it 's impossible to read that word without thinking of things that you regret yourself , he says , or to read " unbepissed " ( not having been urinated on ) without a chuckle .
Winter sun " Knowing what to call something makes me more aware of that thing .
For instance , it 's not terribly useful for me to know that [ the sound of ] leaves rustled by the trees is a psithurism .
" I do n't want to walk down the street with my girlfriend saying : ' Listen , there 's a psithurism . '
But knowing it means I pay more attention to it . "
Similarly , knowing that " undisonant " is the adjective to describe the sound of crashing waves and that " apricity " is the warmth of the winter sun brings these things more often to mind .
For a desert island , one would choose a good dictionary rather than the greatest literary masterpiece imaginable , for , in relation to its readers , a dictionary is absolutely passive and may legitimately be read in an infinite number of ways
Writer WH Auden
" It 's not easy to use them in conversation and so I enjoy them for their own sake .
They are like one - word poems . "
Turning page after page of unfamiliar words made him sometimes feel like he was reading another language , he says .
That was dispiriting but also intriguing , because it showed how rich and powerful the English language is .
But absorbing so much made Mr Shea lose his grasp on his normal vocabulary .
He recalls being fascinated when reading the definition for the word " glove " before he realised it was a word he already knew .
" That happened frequently .
I guess it gave me a useless large vocabulary and in the short - term I lost my normal vocabulary .
I would go to the shop and forget the word for milk .
Momentarily I 'm looking for the cold , white stuff . "
Mr Shea is not alone in his love of dictionaries .
WH Auden waxed lyrical about them and Arthur Scargill said his father would read one every day because his life depended on the power to master words .
Buttock - shaped Thousands of avid Scrabble players read dictionaries looking for words , especially those with a high - scoring J , Q , X or Z , says Elaine Higgleton , editorial director of Collins Dictionaries .
And crossword fans devour dictionaries for the same reason .
" We also have people writing to us who have been very interested in obscure words and obscure definitions .
" A student in Iraq was trying to learn English and he sat down trying to learn every word in the dictionary , starting at the beginning with A and working all the way through .
My father still reads the dictionary everyday .
He says your life depends on your power to master words
Arthur Scargill , 1982 " It 's probably not the best way to learn English , and you 'd learn many more than you would need . "
But dictionaries are a wonderful source of learning about the origins of the English language , she says , and especially the Greek and Latin roots to many of the words .
Collins , which records everyday language rather than all known words , is involved in a campaign to save some of the lesser - used words from being edited out of its future editions .
Stephen Fry , for instance , has championed " fubsy " , which means " short and stout " .
Collins removes words from its dictionaries that have fallen out of use " One of the nice things about dipping in and out of a dictionary is that although people are very comfortable with the vocabulary levels they have , there are some good fun words in there that offer an additional dimension of interest , " says Ms Higgleton .
Some of Mr Shea 's favourites garnered from the OED include " assy " , which means behaving like an ass , and natiform , which means " buttock - shaped " .
It 's impossible to be intimidated by a dictionary that uses a word like assy , he says , and to pick one up and glance through one - rather than just opening one when in trouble with a word - can be a captivating experience .
And how much of what he has read has stayed between his ears ?
Throwing 10 reasonably obscure words from the OED at him , Mr Shea was able to correctly define five of them .
Not a bad success rate after reading 59 million words .

Chamomile Tea
ACTUAL COLLEGE THEME PAPER - HEY I COULDN'T MAKE THIS UP
Remember the book " Men are from Mars , Women are from Venus " ?
Well , here 's a prime example offered by an English professor
at an American University .
" Today we will experiment with a new form called the tandem story .
The process is simple .
Each person will pair off with the person
sitting to his or her immediate right .
One of you will then write
the first paragraph of a short story .
The partner will read the
first paragraph and then add another paragraph to the story .
The
first person will then add a third paragraph , and so on back and
forth .
Remember to reread what has been written each time in order
to keep the story coherent .
There is to be absolutely NO talking
and anything you wish to say must be written on the paper .
The
story is over when both agree a conclusion has been reached . "
The following was actually turned in by two of my English students :
Rebecca - last name deleted , and Jim - last name deleted .
------------------------------------------------------------
STORY :
( First paragraph by Rebecca )
At first , Laurie could n't decide which kind of tea she wanted .
The
chamomile , which used to be her favorite for lazy evenings at home ,
now reminded her too much of Carl , who once said , in happier times ,
that he liked chamomile .
But she felt she must now , at all costs ,
keep her mind off Carl .
His possessiveness was suffocating , and if
she thought about him too much her asthma started acting up again .
So chamomile was out of the question .
-----------------------------------------------------
( Second paragraph by Jim )
Meanwhile , Advance Sergeant Carl Harris , leader of the attack
squadron now in orbit over Skylon 4 , had more important things to
think about than the neuroses of an air - headed asthmatic bimbo named
Laurie with whom he had spent one sweaty night over a year ago .
" A.S .
Harris to Geostation 17 , he said into his trans - galactic communicator .
" Polar orbit established .
No sign of resistance so
far ... "
But before he could sign off , a bluish particle beam flashed
out of nowhere and blasted a hole through his ship 's cargo bay .
The
jolt from the direct hit sent him flying out of his seat and across
the cockpit .
----------------------------------------------------------
( Rebecca )
He bumped his head and died almost immediately but not before he
felt one last pang of regret for psychically brutalizing the one
woman who had ever had feelings for him .
Soon afterwards , Earth
stopped its pointless hostilities towards the peaceful farmers
of Skylon 4 . Congress Passes Law Permanently Abolishing War and
Space Travel , " Laurie read in her newspaper one morning .
The news
simultaneously excited her and bored her .
She stared out the window ,
dreaming of her youth , when the days had passed hurriedly and
carefree , with no newspapers to read , no television to distract
her from her sense of innocent wonder at all the beautiful things
around her .
" Why must one lose one 's innocence to become a woman ? "
she pondered wistfully .
--------------------------------------------------------
( Jim )
Little did she know , but she had less than 10 seconds to live .
Thousands of miles above the city , the Anu'udrian mothership
launched the first of its lithium fusion missiles .
The dim - witted
wimpy peaceniks who pushed the Unilateral Aerospace Disarmament
Treaty through the congress had left Earth a defenseless target
for the hostile alien empires who were determined to destroy the
human race .
Within two hours after the passage of the treaty
the Anu'udrian ships were on course for Earth , carrying enough
firepower to pulverize the entire planet .
With no one to stop
them , they swiftly initiated their diabolical plan .
The lithium
fusion missile entered the atmosphere unimpeded .
The President ,
in his top - secret Mobile submarine headquarters on the ocean floor
off the coast of Guam , felt the inconceivably massive explosion ,
which vaporized poor , stupid Laurie and 85 million other Americans .
The President slammed his fist on the conference table .
" We can 't
allow this !
I 'm going to veto that treaty !
Let 's blow 'em out of
the sky ! "
---------------------------------------------------------
( Rebecca )
This is absurd .
I refuse to continue this mockery of literature .
My writing partner is a violent , chauvinistic semi-literate
adolescent .
----------------------------------------------------------
( Jim )
Yeah ?
Well , you 're a self - centered tedious neurotic whose attempts
at writing are the literary equivalent of Valium .
" Oh shall I have
chamomile tea ?
Or shall I have some other sort of F*CKING TEA ???
Oh
no , I 'm such an air headed bimbo who reads too many Danielle Steele
novels . "
----------------------------------------------------------
( Rebecca )
Asshole .
----------------------------------------------------------
( Jim )
Bitch .
----------------------------------------------------------
( Rebecca )
Wanker .
----------------------------------------------------------
( Jim )
slut .
---------------------------------------------------------
( Rebecca )
Get f*cked .
----------------------------------------------------------
( Jim )
Eat shit .
--------------------------------------------------------
( Rebecca )
F*CK YOU - YOU NEANDERTHAL !!!
----------------------------------------------------------
( Jim )
Go drink some tea - whore .

A+ I really liked this one .
South Korean officials say gunmen have hijacked a Japanese cargo ship off the coast of Somalia carrying 23 crew including five South Koreans .
The ship was seized in the Gulf of Aden on Saturday , officials said .
The condition of the crew is not known and it is not clear if the pirates are demanding a ransom .
So far this year , Somali pirates have seized more than 30 vessels , making the shipping lanes through the Gulf of Aden the most dangerous in the world .
A South Korean foreign ministry official said the 23 abducted sailors included Filipinos as well as the five South Koreans .
Last Wednesday , the Russian navy said Russian and British ships had repelled a pirate attack on a Danish ship in waters off Somalia .
Tanker seized
Hours earlier , pirates had seized a Turkish chemical tanker off the coast of Yemen , along with its 14 - member Turkish crew .
And last Monday Somali pirates hijacked another chemical tanker with 21 Filipino crew on board .
Pirates are still holding the Ukrainian ship MV Faina off the Somali coast for a ransom of $ 20 m ( £ 12 m ) .
In October , 22 sailors - eight South Koreans and 14 Burmese - were freed after a month of captivity when their South Korean shipping company paid a ransom to Somali pirates .
South Korea has said it is considering sending navy vessels to waters off Somalia to protect its shipping .
( Parenting ) --
" Now stay in bed and go to sleep , " my husband , Bill , said as he hugged our 3 - year - old son , Davey , good night .
" If you do n't , I 'm gonna talk in my troll voice all day tomorrow . "
As dads spend more time with their kids , mothers sometimes feel they have to defend their territory .
I smiled with pity at this poor , deluded man .
Several times a night , Davey had been getting up to look at books .
I had spent fruitless hours reasoning with him .
No way could Bill 's threat make a difference , especially since Davey found his troll - under - the - bridge act more funny than scary .
But that night , Davey did n't get up once .
In the morning he ran around crowing that he'd won and the troll could n't come .
Bill , unlike me , must have known that Davey needed to turn staying in bed into a game .
Of course I was grateful .
I was also just the tiniest bit jealous .
Why had n't I been the one with the great insight ?
Why could n't I talk like a troll ?
It 's comforting to know that I 'm not the only mom who 's had such moments .
Plenty of us admit to everything from mild envy to full - blown resentment of our mates ' parenting skills .
And that makes us feel ungrateful : After all , we finally have something that mothers have wanted for generations : an extra pair of hands .
Today 's dads spend 21.7 hours a week on child care and related duties such as shopping and housework , up nine hours from 30 years ago , according to research by the University of Maryland .
Which is n't to say that moms still do n't handle the vast majority of kid- linked tasks -- a whopping 39 hours weekly .
Still , our guys are doing more than their dads did .
Fathers clip tiny toenails and baby - food coupons .
They read bedtime stories and clothing labels .
And while some of our own dads had no clue about how to change a diaper , our kids ' dads often have fierce opinions on Luvs versus Huggies .
Parenting : Secrets to a made - to - last marriage
We moms say we want our spouses to be do - it - all dads :
We 're forward - thinking women of the 21st century .
Besides , if they did less , we could n't possibly juggle our busy lives without going nuts .
" But we do n't want them to take over , " says Pyper Davis , a mother of two in Washington , D.C. " We do n't ever want to be pushed off that throne of being Mommy . "
Jealousy and envy and ego , oh my !
One reason we 're possessive of the parental crown may be that , although society 's changed , we still get traditional messages about women 's roles .
" A lot of our mothers , our workplaces , our TV shows still tell us that moms should do most of the childcare , " says Liz Park , Ph.D. , a marriage and family therapist with three kids in Crownsville , Maryland .
We moms can be good at taking such messages to heart .
Parenting : Keeping score in the chore wars
" For women , no matter how far along you are in your career or no matter how much of a feminist you consider yourself to be , at some level you 're coming from an assumption that women are caretakers , " says Heather Gerken of New Haven , Connecticut , a law professor and the mother of Anna , 6 , and Ben , 2 .
" When Anna was a baby , I would feel guilty about the time away from her , " she says .
And at home , sharing child care with her husband , she felt a little jealous that he was as central to Anna 's life as she was .
" Now that I 've gone through this twice , all I 'd add is that the twinges of regret are overwhelmed by the joy of raising kids together .
There 's no other reason I can think of for that jealousy , except for the guilty , nagging feeling that you ought to be spending more time with your child . "
Well , there are at least a few other reasons .
The briefness of those precious early years , for one .
" When our son was a baby , Brian gave him more of his baths , " says Jessica Davis of Chicago .
( Both names were changed . )
She believed it was important for them to have such one - on - one moments , but " I remember thinking a few times , ' I should take the bath with him ! '
Especially when they 're babies , you 're likely to think , ' I want this piece or that piece ' because babies sleep so much and quality time with them is much more limited than with an older child . "
Parenting 's guide to kid sleep
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Health Library
Then there 's the matter of love .
Naturally , when our spouses spend extra time nurturing our children , the kids become extra attached .
" David * just adores his dad .
He 's his little shadow , " Amy Conner * of Nashua , New Hampshire , says of her 3 - year - old son .
She understands the daddy worship ; she thinks her husband , is " more playful " with David than she is .
" But at first it just hurt because I did n't feel that he loved me as much as [ him ] , " she admits .
For some moms , like me , what hurts is a deep - seated notion that we should be better parents than our spouses -- more instinctive , more inventive , more in tune with our kids ' needs .
D'Anne Gleicher of Alameda , California , finds herself battling this idea when her daughter is sick .
Because she can't get paid time off from her job as an attorney , her husband is usually the one to stay home with Ava , 8 .
" I know he 's very capable of caring for her , but I want to believe I 'm better at it than he is -- even though I 'm not .
I think it 's the whole ' I 'm the mommy and I can fix anything . '
It 's almost like a savior thing . "
Working mothers are n't the only ones who long to be saviors .
Sarah Mock of Tualatin , Oregon , quit working as a high school teacher when her second daughter was born .
" When you 've made this decision to stay home , you 've given up this side of you where you can shine as your own person .
Instead , you feel pressure to shine as a parent , " she explains .
Which can make it frustrating when your husband is as much fun with the kids as you are .
" Recently John helped them make their own version of Candy Land .
I thought , ' Why can't I think of things that are more creative ? ' " she says .
" It seems he 's doing very well at work and then when he comes home he 's doing very well with the kids , so it 's like he 's doing great everywhere and I 'm running to keep up . "
Who 's the boss ?
If we 're not careful , jealousy and insecurity can turn moms into control freaks .
So says Park , a recovering control freak herself .
" With our first child , I was constantly asking my husband , ' Are you making sure he 's getting his vegetables ? '
It feels good to make the decisions . "
Trouble is , " the more we control how dads do things , the less involved they want to be , " Park says .
A recent Ohio State University study of almost 100 couples with newborns backs her up : Researchers found that even dads who believed they should be highly involved in childcare shied away from doing things for their infant if Mom was very judgmental .
Parenting :
The truth about bonding
So Park recommends trying what she did with her husband and her son , Joe , now 11 .
" I had to let go and let them have their own relationship -- he 's a competent man !
If Joe does n't have a vegetable , who cares ? "
When you find yourself hovering , Park suggests , leave the room .
And if you feel compelled to share some crucial knowledge -- the latest food pyramid for toddlers , say -- try offering him some childcare lit .
" That way it 's neutral .
It 's not like you 're dictating to him how to do it , " she says .
Rethinking the rivalry
As for curbing the green - eyed monster , it comes down to discovering things you do well with your kids .
When they 're babies , simply breastfeeding them is something Dad can't do , and may be enough .
Later on , try sharing your passions , from gardening to karate .
It 's also smart to take turns doing the fun stuff , like playing with the kids , as well as the non-fun stuff ( say , disciplining them ) .
Dad 's giving the baths ?
Great .
Make storytime yours , instead of moping .
Parenting : Play list
Most important , moms say , remember how lucky your kids are to have two hands - on parents .
Gleicher hopes that having a caring , involved father will one day spur her daughter to choose a guy with those qualities .
" She wo n't end up with somebody she does n't respect , " she says .
Speaking of respect , adds Gerken , it 's the best cure she 's found yet for parental jealousy .
" Just to glory in your husband 's abilities as a dad , I think , is key , " she says .
Next time Bill pulls off a child - care coup , I plan to be a model of admiration .
I 'll watch and learn .
And I wo n't begrudge him his troll voice one bit -- as long as talking like SpongeBob can be mine , all mine .
